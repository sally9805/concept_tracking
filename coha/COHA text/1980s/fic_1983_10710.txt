MRS . POLLIFAX ON TOE CHINA STATIONlooked squarely at her Mrs. Pollifax swore that she saw a twinkle in the man 's eye . " Just George will do , " he said . A twinkle , a baseball cap , and a tight mouth  --  very interesting , she thought . " I 'm Emily Pollifax , " she told them , and mentally running over Bishop 's list she added , " And now we 're all here except for one person . " At that moment she became aware that Sullen Young Man from the nearby table had risen and was strolling toward them , still looking as if he preferred to be elsewhere , and also rather out of place in his ancient faded jeans and jogging shoes . Reachingthem he said , " I 've had my breakfast and I 'm just leaving  --  I 'm Peter Fox . " He looked at each of them one by one , nodded , added , " See you later , " and before anyone could speak he walked out of the breakfast room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she gazed after him . She wondered whether his hostility was going to infectand effect the others ; she thought , too , how unfriendly it was of him to have sat nearby for so long , watching but without declaring himself . But there was research to be done on all of them , she remembered , and with a glance at her watch she excused herself , securein the knowledge that at least she had met her six tour companions , however superficially . At the top of her research list , however , she now placed Peter Fox . Assignment aside , she found that she was intensely curious as to what had brought him here , and apparently so unwillingly . Huge crowds surrounded the railway station , encircling it in lines ten deep until it looked , said George Westrum , exactly like a baseball stadium at World Series time besieged by eager fans . With Miss Chu and Mr. Li to run interference , they made their way through line after line to a smaller queue inside the building , where they waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food packages in string bags in the other : visitors to Canton , bearing gifts to relatives . " ' Phis must be first class , " murmured George Westrum , standingjust behind her . MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 21 " In a classless society ? " said Mrs. Pollifax in amazement . Again she surprised that twinkle . " It 's a matter of semantics , " he said . " They call them soft seats , as against the hard seats for the masses out there . " " You 've visited China before , then ? " " I read a lot , " he said simply . She smiled at him . " And what do you think of our newly met China guide ? " " Mr. Li ? Young and very organized , " he said . " Put him in Western clothes and he 'd be a junior executive anywhere . IBM , probably . " She laughed . In spite of Mr. Li 's modest attire it was exactly that executive quality , with its sense of coiled energy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or perhaps his attire was n't modest at all , she thought , as she glanced around and compared him with the other Chinese waiting in line , for his sandals were of leather , not plastic ; she had already glimpsed black silk socks with tiny clocks on them , and he wore a digital watch on his wrist . She only wished that she could be more confident about his English , which was spoken with enthusiasm at a reckless speed and with an explosive laugh at the end of each statement . The crowd suddenly began to move and they achieved the train at last , said good-bye to Miss Chu , and climbed aboard the appointed car that would take them across the Lo Wu bridge into Mainland China . Mrs. Pollifax , entering the car last of all , chose to sit next to Peter Fox , from whom she received a swift , bored glance . Paying this no attention she gazed around in awe at the starched lace curtains at each window of the railway car , and the pale blue decor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all seated than a young woman hurried out from some inner sanctum to run a damp floor mop up and down the aisle and erase every hint of traffic . Music began ; a small TV screen over the door sprang to life and as the train began to move , so did figures on the screen : a happy smiling young woman sang a Chinese song in a strident singsong voice ; a handsome young man joined her and with large gestures and an even happier smile reinforced the suggestion of total bliss in Mainland China . Mrs. Pollifax watched in fascination , and then her atten-22 MRS . POLLIFAX ON IHF : CHINA STATIONtion moved past Peter Fox 's impassive profile to the lush green countryside sliding past the window . Eventually the stoniness of that profile challenged her . " Excited ? " she asked Peter Fox , not without irony . He turned and gave her a measuring glance . " Half and half , " he said with a shrug . Being direct by nature she refused such tiresome ambiguousness . " What made you come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose China ? " " I did n't , " he said . Mrs. Pollifax began to feel amused by this conversation . " I thought you seemed a little martyred , " she said , warming to the game . " Of course my next question  --  naturally  --  is just why and what  --  " But apparently he was not playing games . " I did n't mean to seem martyred , " he said , with deadly seriousness and a scowl . " It 's just I 'm still making up my mind whether I 'll like it . It 's a college graduation present from my grandmother . " " Ah , " said Mrs. Pollifax . " It was her idea then , China ? " He nodded . " She was born here  --  spent the first thirteen years of her life in China , so China it had to be . " " For you but not for her ? " He said with a shrug , " Well , she 's been in a wheelchair the last eight years . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no choice , " she said , nodding , and noticed how white his skin was at close quarters . A pair of too-heavy dark eyebrows emphasized this pallor , and when they drew together in a frown  --  as they were doing now  --  they dominated his face , with its high cheekbones and stubborn jaw . " Nell  --  since I 've never traveled before , " he said with another shrug , " China just seems a freaky place to start . I mean , I 've never traveled even in the United States , let alone Europe where everyone seems to begin . I suppose you 've been to Europe ? " he asked suspiciously . " Oh , here and there , " she said vaguely , and watching that impassive fare she asked on irnpulse , " Do n't you ever smile ? " Ile turned . and gave her such a suddenly shrewd and thoughtMRS . POLLIFAX ON ' 1'H1 CHINA STATION 23ful look that she was taken aback ; she realized that in some way she was amusing him . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very hostile , she thought . " I was also wondering how old you are , " she told him with a smile . " A second impertinent question for you . " " Twenty-two , " he said dryly . In the seat ahead of them Malcolm Styles turned and said , " I heard that , and I 'm sitting with Jenny here , who 's twenty-five . Shall we change seats and let the infants have a go at each other ? " Jenny 's piquant face surfaced beside his . " Infants ! " she protested . " Why do n't we just turn the seats and face each other ? " " You 'll miss the scenery . " " We can see it backwards for a while . Where was your grandmotherborn in China , Peter ? " He reached into his duffle bag and brought out a small wrinkledmap . " We go near it toward the end of the tour . I was told the guide could arrange a side trip so I can take pictures . A little village outside Datong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not too far from Beijing . " Malcolm said gently , " I hope we can all see it . What was it like in those days ? " " Warlords , " said Peter , and nodded . " Yeah , I guess it 'll be interesting to see what 's happened since then ; it sure beats reading about it . Her father was a doctor-missionary , and I guess they saw terrible things while they were there . Droughts . Famine . Confiscatory taxes . Disease . " " I hear even flies have been eliminated now , " said Malcolm , " although not the occasional drought , flood , and earthquake , unfortunately . What about you , Jenny ? " he asked . " Why China ? " Jenny beamed at him . " Well , I 'd done enough backpacking through Europe  --  sorry , Peter , " she said , laughing at him , " and China it had to be , even if I had to borrow half the money to get here , which I did , because second-grade teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she explained with a lively gesture . " Not rich but a second-grade teacher . There 's such a strong24 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONpull in me toward China that I just have to have been Chinese in a past life . " " The Empress of course , " said Peter , and suddenly grinned at her , those relentless black brows lifting to wipe away several years and make him a believable twenty-two-year-old . " A smile ! " exclaimed Malcolm , with a humorous glance at Mrs. Pollifax . " I see it , " she said , smiling back at him . " Beautiful . " With the arrival of Peter 's first smile came the young woman with mop and pail again , to walk up and down and leave glisteningstreaks of water behind her . Mrs. Pollifax 's gaze moved beyondher to the window : to rice paddies with tender green shoots springing out of the water , a water buffalo plodding along a path behind an old woman , piles of mud-and-straw bricks and trimmed logs , and a house on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " Malcolm , please . " " Okay . Malcolm , you have n't said what you do when you 're not traveling . " Mrs. Pollifax watched the black guardsman 's moustache tilt down as the brows rose humorously . " Now that will have to wait , " he told her lightly , " because it 's time for me to check out the men 's room  --  if my walking up the aisle does n't bring out that mop again . " Mrs. Pollifax gave him a thoughtful glance as he left , thinking how adroitly he 'd sidestepped answering Jenny when it would have needed only a second to say I 'm in business , theater , or advertising . She 'd not expected him to be evasive ; his voice had been quietly dismissing , and there was no overlooking his welltimedretreat . She wondered what he wanted to conceal and why he was n't ready for that question . Perhaps , she speculated , he was taking refuge in the men 's room to decide just what he did do when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard for her coagent , except that she kit it ridiculous that she not know . The train was slowing . Joe Forbes strolled up the aisle and called uut to them , " Mr. I , i says we 're reaching the border now , and box lunches for us in half an hour . " MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 25At once cameras were unfurled and the buffs sprang to their feet , everyone except Mrs. Pollifax and Iris , who remained seated up front . Gazing out the window she thought again , So many people ! They stood in queues , waiting to board the rear cars that George Westrum had called hard seats , and the lines were serpentine : men and women in simple cotton clothes holding bundles and waiting , among them soldiers in khaki with red stars on their caps , and behind them a series of shabby buildings and the outline of low green hills . Mrs. Pollifax left her seat and walked down the aisle to join Iris . " Not taking pictures , I see . " Iris looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few later , just for me . " She smiled . " No matter what I do , though , they come out weird . Heads chopped off , and that sort of thing . " With a gesture toward the window she said , " I was just thinking what my friend Suzie would say about all those huts and rice paddies we passed . Suzie loves glamour ; she 'd say , You 're spending all that money to fly halfway around the world and see this ? " ' Mrs. Pollifax smiled . " I suppose if you chose one of the city tours  --  Shanghai especially  --  you 'd find nightlife and glamour . Were you tempted ? " " Cities are what I know best , " Iris said ruefully . " But , " she added firmly , " I wanted something different . " Mrs. Pollifax nodded . " I think you found it . " Iris grinned back at her . " I think so , too . " She turned in her seat to face her . " Look , Mrs.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it 's no good , is it . " " No , " said Mrs. Pollifax calmly . " Damn , " Iris said without rancor , " I knew I should n't trust Suzie . She 's a go-go dancer , " she explained , " and the only person I know who 's traveled . Once to the Caribbean and once to Bermuda , so I let her choose for me . " " I 've never met a go-go dancer , " Mrs. Pollifax said thoughtfully . " Really ? " Iris bestowed her large radiant smile on her . " I should keep my mouth shut , but since you 've never met one I 'll tell you that you 're talking to one now . You would n't believe it , would you , with me being so clumsy , but when I dance I 'm not. 26 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONAnd how else would I know Suzie ? " she asked candidly . " I did it full time for three years , and then when I started college I worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " College last month , " repeated Mrs. Pollifax , and realized that her instincts had been sound and that Iris was going to have ever-widening dimensions . " Began college at twenty-eight , " Iris said triumphantly . " Took a high-school-equivalency test and just started because I never did finish high school . Maybe it 's a college nobody 's heard of , but it was just right for me . And I happened to take a year 's course on China , " she added , " and was the only person in the class to get an A. So I decided you could have Paris and London , I was going to come to China . Except I told Suzie there 'd be no cocktail parties or men , but she said , What 's a trip without cocktailparties and men ? ' " " What indeed , " said Mrs. Pollifax , fascinated . " So I reminded her men are what I do n't need , having been married often enough , but Suzie  --  " " Often enough ? " echoed Mrs. Pollifax , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At sixteen to a cowboy  --  that was Mike  --  and then to Stanley , who turned out to be a crook , and then to Orris . He struck oil , which is when he decided he was too good for me . He was nice , though , he gave me a really fair shake when he left , and I may be dumb about clothes but not about money . That 's when I decided I 'd had enough , though , and it was time to change my life . " " Yes , " said Mrs. Pollifax , and waited . " I mean , " Iris went on eagerly , " we let men define who we are , right ? That 's Women 's Lib . I went to some of the meetings at college and I could see how it had been with me . For Mike I ate beans and franks all the time and was a cocktail waitress . For Stanley I learned how to keep my mouth shut about his shady deals  --  ' button up , ' he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the oil fields and was a go-go dancer until he struck it rich . And you know what ? " she added , leaning forward and shoving back her Inane of hair , " I did it all to please them , not Inc . " MRS . POLLIFAX ON Ink , CHINA STATION 27 " I see exactly what you mean , " said Mrs. Pollifax , admiring the passion of Iris ' discoveries . " Except now I 've let Suzie influence me , " she said , glancingruefully down at the huge polka dots and stiff white collar . " What do I do ? Will there be clothes in Canton , do you think ? " " Chinese clothes . " Iris scowled . " I 'm too big , I 'm nearly six feet tall . " " Did n't you bring anything to  --  well , relax in ? " " I stuck in a pair of old jeans at the last minute  --  something old and something blue , " she said wryly . " In case I had a chance to ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wear them , " Mrs. Pollifax told her firmly . Iris looked startled . " But Jenny 's in that pretty little skirt and blouse , and look at you in  --  " Mrs. Pollifax shook her head . " Wear them . " Iris sighed . " Gosh , the money I spent on all this stuff , enough to keep Vogue Boutique in business a whole year , I swear . " " You 'll look splendid in jeans , " said Mrs. Pollifax , paying this no attention . " Be yourself . " Iris considered this and sighed again . " There it is again , the hardest thing of all , do n't you think ? Being yourself ? But if I should blossom out in my jeans tomorrow would you stick near me ? " " For the initial impact , yes , but after that you 're on your own . , Iris grinned . " You 're really nice . I thought when I first saw you , oh boy she 'll be the one to cold-shoulder me  --  I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . And here I end up telling you the story of my life . " " Stanley , " said Mrs. Pollifax , " would have told you to button up ' ? " Iris laughed her joyous laugh . " You sure listened if you remember that . Oh-oh , here comes Mr. Forbes again . He 's certainlyno talker , he just keeps studying that Chinese dictionary of his . " " Yes , but I took his seat and I 'll let him have it back now , " Mrs. Pollifax told her . " I 'll see you later , Iris . " As the others streamed back into the car the train lurched and28 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONthen began to move , and Mr. Li appeared carrying a carton of box lunches for them . A moment later the railway station and the border were behind them , and Mrs. Pollifax thought , We 're now in Mainland China . It begins at last. 3THEY DINED LATE THAT AFTERNOON in the Guangzhou Restaurant , just off the train and in another world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guangzhou , or Canton guide who explained that the hotel was so far out of town that they must have their Chinese banquet now . The man 's name was Tung , and Mrs. Pollifax began to understand now that only Mr. Li was to be permanent and theirs ; the others would come and go , with names like Chu and Tung , leaving only vague impressions behind . In any case , Mrs. Pollifax felt that her sense of inner time was still so confused that a banquet in late afternoon could scarcely be more difficult than breakfast at night over the Pacific . They were here , very definitely in China , on the second floor of a huge old wooden building in a room filled with large round tables , only one of which was occupied by a family of Chinese who ate and talked with enthusiasm in a far corner : a wedding party , explainedMr . Li . With her chopsticks Mrs. Pollifax lifted a slice of sugared tomatotoward her mouth and experienced triumph at its arrival . From where she sat she could look out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes hung on a rope stretched from eave to eave : an assortment of grays , dull blues , and greens . She decided that it was probably not someone 's laundry30 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONbecause the wide street outside had been lined with just such clothing too , hung like banners from every apartment above the street floor . Presumably it was an efficient solution to a lack of closet space , and remembering her own crowded closets at home she pondered the effect on her neighbors if she did this at the Hemlock Arms . Mr. Li , seated beside her , chose this moment to announce , " It is important there be a leader to this group . You are oldest , Mrs. Pollifax , you will please be leader ? " Mrs. Pollifax , glancing around , said doubtfully , " I 'm the oldest , yes , but I wonder if perhaps  --  " She stopped , aware that Iris ' eyes were growing huge with alarm at the thought of her deferring to a man and betraying The Cause . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a leader , and Carstairs ' words drifted back to her : if anything unusual happens  --  if anything goes wrong  --  get that group the hell out of China . Possibly , she decided , it might prove convenient . " Yes of course , " she said , and smiled demurely at Iris across the table . Mr. Li laughed merrily . " Good  --  okay ! You can find for me out of each person what they most want to see . For the arrangements . We can not promise them , it is the local guides who decide , but I struggle for you . " " Yes , " said Mrs. Pollifax , and decided not to mention the Drum Tower in Xian just yet . " For tomorrow , " said Mr. Li , " Mr. Tung has arranged  --  " He bent his ear to Mr. Tung and surfaced , nodding . " We visit Dr. Sun Yet-sen Memorial Hall , the panda at the zoo , various other stops , and late in afternoon departure to Xian . " " ' ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out Malcolm , nodding . George Westrum , on her left , said gruffly , " For myself , I 'll say right now that I want to see their farms , and the equipment they have . That 'll be communes , of course . " " I 'll make a note of that , " she told him . " You 're a farmer , George ? " " I lave a few acres , " he said. ' trs . Pollifax gave him an exasperated glance . She had wrested words out of young Peter , and had witnessed Malcolm 's evaMRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 31siveness , and she was bored with all this modesty . She asked bluntly , " How many ? " " Several thousand , " he admitted . " Cows , horses , sheep , or grain ? " she shot back . " Beef cattle . And oil . " " Anal " He nodded . " A surprise to me , that oil , " he said . " Retired early from government work  --  " " Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , expecting to raise cattle , not oil . That young lady I saw you talking to on the train , " he said casually , with a not-so-casual glance across the table at Iris . " She Miss or Mrs. Damson ? " Mrs. Pollifax 's aha was silent this time . " I have n't the slightest idea , " she told him cheerfully , " except that I do know she 's not married now . Is this a thousand-year-old egg ? " she asked , turning to Mr. Li . " Oh yes , but not a thousand years old , " he said with his quick smile and another merry laugh . " It tastes like egg , it just looks rather odd , as if it had been left out of the refrigerator too long . " Jenny said , " I believe they 're soaked in brine or something , and buried in the earth . " " The food 's coming with frightening speed now , " pointed out Malcolm across the table as the waiter brought still another platterto the table . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece between chopsticks and delivering it to his mouth before passing it on . " How many meals will be Chinese on our trip ? " " It is good , you all using chopsticks , " said Mr. Li . " Very good . You , Mr. Fox  --  press fingers a little higher , " he told Peter , receivinga hostile glance in return . " The food ? After tomorrow no Western food . " " Not even breakfast ? " gasped Jenny . " Chinese breakfast . " " What fun , " cried Iris with a radiant smile . " I 've been studying Chinese this last year , " Joe Forbes told32 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CIIINA STATIONhim across the table . " I 'd like to try it out on you now and then . For instance , would I be called a da bi zi ? " Both Mr. Li and Mr. Tung burst out laughing . " Xiao hua , " cried Mr. Li enthusiastically . " Meaning what ? " asked Jenny . Joe Forbes said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose ' among the Chinese  --  except it 's so damn easy to get the tones wrong . Did I ? " " You did , yes , " Mr. Tung assured him , " and Comrade Li said Xiao hua , meaning a joke ' ! " " Surely we 're called round eyes , not long noses , " asked Malcolm . " Anyway not foreign devils anymore , " contributed Jenny . " Capitalist-roaders ? " suggested Iris , grinning . Mr. Tung gave an embarrassed laugh . Mr. Li lifted his glass of pale orange soda pop and said , " Let us toast to **25;11960;TOOLONG ! " Mrs. Pollifax raised her own glass of soda . The others lifted their glasses of Chinese beer , which she promised herself she would try the next day , since water was advised against , the tea extremely weakz and the soda tasted rather like flavored water . In the meantime she waited to ask George Westrum just what his government service might have been . He was a silent man but he talked well when he did speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was that occasional twinkle of humor that suggested other dimensions . He must certainly have retired early  --  as CIA men often did , Bishop had told her  --  because he looked to be still in his fifties , and he was obviously strong . She felt that he was noticing everyone and everything  --  watching and alert  --  and she was amused that he had especially noticed Iris . But there was no opportunity to question George Westrum fnrthcr . Mr. Li , pleased that Forbes was learning Mandarin , at once gimped the chance to practice his English , and their exchange of words occupied the others . " Yes , I teach history , " Forbes was saying , " in a small Midwestern university . " He was smiling but Mrs. Pollifax realized that actually he did not smile all the time , it was merely an illusion caused by the arrangementMRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 33of his features , but definitely smiling now , she could see the difference . " Professor ? " said Iris , and made a startled gesture that struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . Iris turned scarlet . " Oh , " she gasped . " Oh I 'm terribly sorry . " She dropped her napkin and started after it . Malcolm placed a firm hand on her arm . " Please , " he said with a smile . " Not again . Let me do the honors this time . " " Oh ! Oh thank you , " said Iris , her cheeks burning . But a waiter had rushed to the table to wipe up the spilled beer , just as another waiter arrived bearing a huge soup tureen . " Now that looks too heavy for Iris to tip over , " Jenny said , with a laugh . " I understand soup means the end of a meal in your country , " Joe Forbes put in . " In America we have it first , you know . " Mr. Tung looked appalled . " We feel , " explained Mr. Li gently , " that it belongs at the end . To settle the dinner . " " And do n't forget , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk , printing , gunpowder , and porcelain among other things . " " But obviously not the idea of soup to end a meal , " added Jenny . Mrs. Pollifax put down her chopsticks . It had been a lavish dinner  --  melons , rice , pork , shrimp , eggs , tomatoes , more courses than she could count  --  but she was glad to see it ending . It 's been  --  a long day , she thought , and I miss Cyrus . . . I ca n't go through China missing Cyrus , I have work to do . I have n't managed Yoga for three days , perhaps that 's it . They rose from the table , descended dusty wooden stairs , and left the restaurant to be assaulted by the life outside . Mrs. Pollifaxrevived at once and looked around her with pleasure : at the broad street dense with people and bicycles , at children stopping to stare at them shyly and then smile . Off to one side she saw a line of stalls piled high with shirts , plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A woman and child sat patiently beside a very small table , waiting to sell a few bottles of garishly bright orange soda pop . Across the street small huts had been squeezed on top of the roof of a long cement building from34 MRS . POLLIFAX ON TAM CHINA STATIONwhich the paint was peeling . Flowers in pots stood on ledges , or flowed down from roof dwellings and apartments to overhang the street . The colors were muted , except for the flowers and the flash of an occasional red shirt . Even the sounds were muted : the persistent ringing of bicycle bells  --  there were no cars  --  and the shuffle of feet . It was approaching dusk , and the day 's heat had turned into a warmth that mingled pleasantly with the smells of cooking food . This is more like it , thought Mrs. Pollifax , drinking in the smells and sights , and it was with reluctance that she climbed back into the minibus . This time it was Malcolm Styles who took the seat next to her . As he leaned over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notebook fell out of his pocket and dropped into her lap . She picked it up and handed it back to him , but a solitary sheet of paper had escaped and settled into a niche beside the window . Retrieving this she glanced at it and gasped , " But how lovely ! " It was a sketch  --  a line-drawing in pen and ink  --  of a Chinese child , no more than a quick sketch but with lines so fluid and joyfulthat it staggered her with its delicacy , its aliveness . She looked at Malcolm with amazement . " You 're an artist ! " His grin was rueful , those thick brows drawing together deprecatingly . " Of a sort . " " Stop being modest , " she told him sternly . " What do you do with a gift like this ? " His eyes smiled at her . " I 'm not at all modest , " he told her . " Really I 'm not . I just feel very uncomfortable when people learn that I wrote and illustrated the Tiny Tot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Styles ' picture books , and  --  " " The Doctor Styles ' books ! " she exclaimed . " Good heavens , my grandchild adores them , I sent him one at Christmas and  --  but that means you also wrote The Boy Who Walked Into a Rain-bow ? " I Ie nodded . " ' J'liat 's me . " She gazed at him incredulously . " I thought you were an actor or a fervent businessman , " she told him . " Or a male model  --  you lwow , distinguished gentleman who drinks only the best sherryMRS . POLLIFAX ON TILE CHINA STATION 35or stands beside a Rolls-Royce smoking a briar pipe and looking owlish . " " With attache case ? " he asked interestedly . " Oh , welded to one , " she told him .

" " Well  --  yes , " she admitted , smiling . " Yes , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he assured her . " Usually there 's an instinctive withdrawal , then a look of suspicion , followed by a hearty By Jove that 's nice , ' and a very hasty retreat . I must say you 've taken it rather well , though . " " Not a great deal surprises me , " admitted Mrs. Pollifax . " Not anymore , at least . It must surely make for a very good life ? " " Oh yes I 'm very fortunate , " he said lightly . " I do only one book a year now , and that leaves six months for travel or for anything else that appeals . " Six months , she mused , turning this over in her mind ; yes there were certain possibilities there , and his books made for wonderful cover . " Are you hoping for a book from this trip ? " He said softly , " Oh I think not , but it will refresh me . I 'm looking forward intensely to the Qin Shi Huang Tombs  --  " " Oh yes ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . " They had been driving through darkening streets  --  there were no street lights  --  and now as night arrived there were only dim electric lights shining yellow in the apartments along the streets . Glancing up she could look into the windows and see a single feeble bulb suspended from the ceiling , see the dark silhouette of a man standing at a window peering out , glimpse a face seated at a table reading , the light etching the face in chiaroscuro . Hong Kong 's fluorescent lights had been stark clear white ; here the color was a yellow that barely illuminated the dark caves of rooms . " Surely those ca n't be more than twenty-watt bulbs ? " she murmured to Malcolm , pointing . " Twenty-five at most , " he said. 36 MRS . POLLIFAX ON 1HJ CHINA STATIONHuge dark China , she thought , moved by the silence , the absenceof cars , and the darkness . The buildings thinned until the headlights of the bus picked out mud-brick walls , then lines of trees with only a solitary light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps  --  and then at last the bus turned down a graveled road that ran through a thinly wooded area , lights gleamed ahead , and they drew up before a huge , raw , half-finished modern building . " I hope , " said Mrs. Pollifax with feeling , " our hotels are n't alwaysgoing to be this far out of town . " " The question being , " Malcolm said , extending a hand to her , " whether they 're trying to keep us from meeting the people , or the people from meeting us . " They walked into a huge echoing lobby that was almost a parodyof contemporary architecture : a few self-consciously Danish chairs , a very Art Deco cobblestone fish pond , with a fountain springing out of its base . They were the only people in the cavernouslobby except for a young woman behind a desk who passed out room keys to them . " Bags outside rooms at half-past seven , " said Mr. Li . " We do not return here to the hotel tomorrow , remember . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " commented Iris , and received an answering smile from George Westrum . Mrs. Pollifax entered room 217 , found it bland but comfortable , with hot water running from its sink taps , and promptly ran a bath and climbed into it . She carried with her a book on China 's history to read , but she did not read it . She was too busy wondering instead what lay ahead of her in this vast country ; she wondered what the others were thinking , and who among them was thinking ahead to Xian , and then to Xinjiang Province lying to the north of them . She was remembering , too , the strange assortment of items that she 'd brought into China with her , the stores of vitamin pills and dried fruit , the thermal socks , and chocolate . She remembered Carstairs saying , " It 's almost as impossible to get an agent into China as it is to get a man out of China . " Out of China . . . this was the question that had occurred and reoccurred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getMRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 37X out of China ? It was a question that had sent her to the very good topographical map in her encyclopedia , and the result had chilled her because Xinjiang Province , thousands of miles from the sea , bordered Tibet and Pakistan and Afghanistan , its desert running like a flat carpet to the terrible mountain ranges of the Kunluns and the Karakaroms . Thermal socks , dried fruit , chocolate . . . the supposition she had drawn still shocked her . But as she slipped into her robe and headed for bed she knew there was still another , even more shocking suspicion that she had consigned to the periphery of her thoughts , not allowing it entry , stubbornly resisting it because if she brought it out and looked at it , she would understand Bishop 's fears for her . Turningout the lights she once again refused it entry and succeeded in pushing it far enough away to fall asleep at once. 4IN THE MORNING IRIS MADE HER APPEARANCE in jeans , and afterfaithfully escorting her downstairs Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed : Jenny whistled , Malcolm gave her a second calm glance , and George Westrum 's eyes rested on her with a glow that Mrs. Pollifax hoped Iris noticed , but doubted that she did ; Joe Forbes murmured , " Well , now , " and even Peter Fox looked mildly appreciative . It was true that at breakfast Iris tipped a plate of peanuts into her lap , with half of them cascading to the floor , but  --  as Jenny cheerfully pointed out  --  peanuts were easier to recover than spilled beer . Iris , thought Mrs. Pollifax , was in danger of being assigned the role of comic in the group . At breakfast and again at lunch Mrs. Pollifax pursued her responsibility of listing for Mr. Li what each person particularly wanted to see , and in this she found no surprises : Joe Forbes wanted to visit a university , Jenny the second-grade class in a school , and George listed only communes . Malcolm 's priorities were more numerous and entirely cultural . Young Peter repeated his request for a side trip to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the Chinese Opera but especially the Ban Po Village Museum in Xian because the artifacts reflected a Neolithic society run by women eight thousand years ago . Woman 's Lib again . For herself , Mrs. Pollifax wrote downMRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 39the Drum Tower in Xian and hoped no one would ask why . After consulting her guidebook she added the Bell Tower for camouflage , and any Buddhist temples . But Guangzhou , or Canton , she found , was mainly a waiting game . She enjoyed their trip to the bank to exchange travelers ' checks for tourist scrip : she watched in fascination as four clerks hovered over her money , carefully checking the amount on an abacus . But tourist money , Mr. Li told them , could not be spent on the streets , at the bazaars , or free markets , only in the government-runshops . Mrs. Pollifax at once rose to this challenge . " How can I get real money ? " she asked him , thinking ahead to possible exigencies , and was told that the Friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereupon she promptly asked for large denominations of tourist scrip , determined to collect as many of the authentic bills as she could . " My new hobby , " she told Malcolm cheerfully . Aside from this , the Dr. Sun Yet-sen Memorial charmed her with its gorgeously intense blue-laquered tiles , but it smelled musty inside ; she obediently oh-d and ah-d at the pandas in the zoo , but the heat there at midday nearly felled her , and once again they lunched on the second floor of a restaurant , with the natives on the street floor below . Only once was she fully startled out of her lingering jet-lag apathy . With an unexpected half hour of time confronting Mr. Tung , he offered them a pleasant stroll down a suburban road that held a mixture of older buildings among the brand-new scaffold-laced structures . One building in particular caught Mrs. Pollifax 's eye , creamy-white against the dull cement facade of its neighbors , and of an architecture that she could only identify in her mind as tropical-colonial . Graceful arched windows , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewels into the smooth creamy walls . Next to an open green door hung a vertical sign , and Mrs. Pollifax brought out her small camera and took a picture of the charming vignette : a courtyard , a door , a leafy green tree , a donkey cart parked next to the door . ' What does the sign say ? " she called to Mr. Tung , pointing. 40 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CMNA STATIONMoving to her side he looked at it . " People 's Security Bureau , " he said , and abruptly turned away , his face expressionless . People 's Security Bureau . . . the Sepos , she remembered from her reading , and she wondered if , since Mao 's death , the Sepos still knocked on doors at midnight to take people away , or whether the new order had changed this . She hoped so . Bishop had said , " You 'll find many surprising changes happening there , but they 've been taking place very cautiously , very slowly . " She lingered a moment gazing at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent facade , and then she turned and hurried away , made uneasy by a vague sense of foreboding . " What did he say that building was ? " asked George Westrum , catching up with her . " People 's Security Bureau . " " Oh , cops . By the way , did you know Malcolm writes kiddies ' books ? " The tone of his voice , she thought , would not have surprised Malcolm . " Yes , very fine ones , " she told him . " Perhaps your children  --  are you married , George ? " He shook his head . " Never had children , been a widower for years . Tell me why in hell a man would write children 's books ? Has n't he grown up yet ? " Mrs. Pollifax glanced at George 's baseball cap , tilted boyishly at the back of his head , and smiled . " Do any of us ? " she asked dryly . " And should we  --  completely ? " He did n't hear her ; he said abruptly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize it 's almost time to be heading for the bus . Excuse me , I 'll just hurry along and tell her . " She watched him march briskly toward Iris , passing Joe Forbes photographing workers mixing cement , then Peter and Jenny taking pictures of each other , and Malcolm aiming his camera at children playing . She smiled , thinking George Westrumwas showing very definite signs of becoming addicted to Iris . In late afternoon they reached the airport , where they said good bye to Mr. ' 1'img . Because there were no reserved seats on the plane , not even for foreigners , there was a mad dash acrossMRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 41the tarmac once the plane was announced , and the group found themselves widely dispersed throughout the small two-engine prop plane . Mrs. Pollif ax settled herself into an aisle seat with two men in Mao jackets beside her , and realized , now that she had sampled a little of China , it was time she began considering just how she was going to approach Comrade Guo Musu in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that no inspirationoccurred to her at all ; she had no idea what the Drum Tower might be , and not even her wildest flights of imagination could conjure up the appearance of a barbershop , which in China would scarcely announce itself with a striped barber pole . It troubled her , too , that so far the tour appeared to be arranged to prevent even the most accidental of encounters with the Chinese , and up against these frustrations she began to reflect insteadon just which member of the group might be her coagent . One of them  --  one person on this plane  --  knew what Xian meant , and why she was here . One person , she reflected , and again asked , who ? Which one ? From where he sat on the plane he could just see the back of Mrs. Pollifax 's head several seats down the aisle , and as the plane lifted he wondered what she was thinking about as they took flight to Xian , and to Guo Musu , and he wondered how in hell she was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little time and the watchful eye of Mr. Li . Once again he shook his head over Carstairs ' choice ; they had a very tight schedule , and if she failed in this contact it was highly doubtful that he would ever find the labor camp by himself . The distances were too vast , and their time too painfully limited . He had programmed himself not to think ahead , but separated from the others now , with two native Chinese between him and the window , he allowed his mind to wander a little from the disciplinehe 'd imposed upon it . He already knew how tough his assignmentwas going to be , and how the rescue of X  --  if it could be accomplished  --  was only the beginning of it . It brought a curiousfeeling to know so much intellectually about China and to apply this knowledge on arrival to the country 's reality : it felt positively schizophrenic , for instance , to be listening with half42 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONhis mind to the conversation between the two Chinese next to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't . In Guangzhou he 'd been sorely tempted to buy a newspaper , a copy of Zhong Guo Qing Nian Bao  --  the China Youth Daily  --  which he was accustomed to reading weeks late , in America . This he had resisted , allowing himself only a glance at its headlines . The two men on his right were discussing production figures . They were both foremen in a factory returning home to Xian after a meeting of cadres in Guangzhou . He was curious about them . They were in their fifties ; one had mentioned that he was born in Nanjing , while the other came from a village outside Beijing . To live now in Xian , so far away , he thought , it would have been shang-shan-xia-xiang that wrenched them from their nativetowns and families , or what was called " up to the mountains and down to the villages , " that great experiment of Mao 's that sent intellectuals into the country to dig wells and plow fields , and peasants out of the villages to be trained and educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in China 's cities , and it was vital to spread them out , except that usually only the peasants  --  the fie ho  --  were ever returned to their nativevillages . The educated young people , the chi-shi qingnian  --  foundthemselves banished forever to the countryside . He wondered how he would feel if , upon graduating from college , he were to be sent off to a remote Inner Mongolian commune , for instance , to be to bao zi , a hick  --  literally a clod of earth  --  for the rest of his life . It had been one of the most astonishing levelingexperiments in modern history , the attempt to reeducate nearly a billion people in the " correct " ideological way to think , as against an incorrect way . . . the turning over of one 's heart and mind to the Motherland , the achievement of absolute trust in the parent-state . Work without laying down conditions . Work without expecting reward . It is the work that counts , not the person . What helps our reform we should talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not talk about at all . Education Through Labor . Dui shi , bi dui ren  --  it is the mistake we areMRS . POLLIFAX ON Tin CHINA STATION 43after , not the man . Be grateful to the state by working with enthusiasm , without thinking of yourself . Except that for X it was not education through labor , but reform through labor , and what would Wang be like after his years in a reform camp ? To survive he would have learned humilitythrough self-criticism and confession ; he would have been taught over and over that he must selflessly work for the greater whole , because whatever changes had occurred since Mao 's death it was doubtful that they would easily reach a labor camp in a remote province . If by now Wang had not turned into a model prisoner , thinking " correct " ideological thoughts , he could just as easily have given up hope and have become a shell of a man . Would he even consent to leave , to escape ? Would he even find Wang ? And if he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What if he had been altered beyond recognition ? From some ancient file there had arrived that single blown-up photograph of a younger Wang . . . Comrade Wang , engineer , greeting volunteer workers for our Motherland 's defensesas they arrive in the north from villages and cities all over our country to joyously give of their labor . There had been no date on the photo , just as there was no knowing what political tide had swept him aside , condemned of revisionist thinking or of being an anti-revolutionist . There were the other unknowns and variables as well : the fact that the only information they had about the logging camp was its existence somewhere in the Tian Shan mountain range and surrounded on three sides by a stream of water so fast-flowing that it could n't be crossed except on horseback . Not that the poor devils needed such barriers , he reflected , because if a prisonerdecided to escape , where could he go ? He needed identity papers , authorization for travel , and coupons for food and clothing , and wherever he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as these did n't undermine his confidence , they were merely parts of a logistics problem that would have to be solved as they left Xian and drew closer to Urumchi and to the Tian Shan range . He knew that he was well trained , that he was nerveless and capable , and he spoke the language fluently . The most aggravating unknown was Mrs. Pollifax . He objected very44 MRS . POLLIFAX ON 1HE CHINA STATIONmuch to having the success of his assignment rest just now in someone else 's hands , much less those of a foolish middle-aged lady . He had fought against this from the beginning , insisting he manage the contact himself , but Carstairs had said , " We ca n't risk you , the contact in Xian is too pivotal , too dangerous . If you should be caught  --  if Guo should betray you  --  we 'd lose you , and you 're irreplaceable because of your background in the country . The situation needs someone entirely different , someone so outwardlyinnocent that she 'll deflect suspicion . " " She ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasantly and said , " Yes , we have a woman in mind . " So here they were , the two of them , locked together into this situation for better or for worse , flying over mountains the color and shape of camels ' humps , in a country whose culture was among the most ancient in the world . And he loved this country , which was a strange thing to discover because he loved so few things . Because of this he knew that he hated Mao for setting China back decades with his cultural revolution that wiped out intellectuals , closed universities , nearly destroyed art and science , and , in turn , brought only a new form of corruption out of the corruptions he 'd intended to erase . Well , that was long since over ; both Mao and the more liberal Chou were dead , and new leaders in command , but the country was still filled with Maoists . He thought wryly of the current political metaphor , " the two ends are hot and the middle is cold , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at both the top and the bottom of the society , but sitting squarely in the middle in many areas were Mao 's bureaucrats , threatened by the progressive changes , indignant , clinging in fury to the old status quo . The reformers were listening , though : how could they help but hear the people at the Democracy Wall in 1979 ? The people still waited with infinite patience for the democracy that had been premised them once by Mao . Ile tinned and looked at the two men beside him , wishing he might ask them it thousand questions . Seeing him glance toward them they smiled , eager to show their friendship . MRS . POLLIFAX ON the CHINA STATION 45 " Ni hao , " he said , carefully avoiding any tonal pronunciation , rendering the greeting flat and drawling and clumsy . The man next to him nodded vigorously ; the second man by the window leaned forward to give him an eager smile and a thumbs-up gesture , and he was offered a Double Happiness brand cigarette , which he politely refused . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saw Mrs. Pollifaxand her two seat companions stand up and change places with an extravagant exchange of bows and smiles : she was being given the window seat , and he wondered wryly how she had accomplishedthis without language . He wondered , too , how much she guessed when she had been told so little . He wondered if it had occurred to her yet that if Mr. Wang 's rescue was a success , the man was going to have to be accompaniedout of China  --  escorted , led , or dragged out , depending on his sympathies and his state of mind . He wondered if she realized that in order to accompany Wang out of the country he himself was going to have to disappear from the tour group  --  and foreigners were simply not allowed to disappear into China . When would she recognize the fact that the whole purpose of the tour was to allow him to vanish  --  and that indeed all of them were hostages to his success in disappearing .. It was a woman guide who met them at the airport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look of awe and delight on Iris ' face at sight of her . Apparently Mr. Li knew the woman from previous trips and greeted her cordially . " This is Miss Bai , " he told them , introducing her . She was a slightly built woman , older than Mr. Li , very serious and intense , in fact one could guess her efficiency by the way that Mr. Li subtly relaxed on finding her there . Noticing this Mrs. Pollifax experienced a sudden insight into the tensions behindMr . Li 's nervous laugh : the necessity to please not only the people he guided but also nameless faceless superiors who had selected him out of thousands to associate with foreigners. 46 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION " You will not be far out of town here , " he told them cheerfully . " The hotel is in the middle of Xian . " " Hooray , " cried Jenny . Because they had all been separated on the plane Mrs. Pollifax noticed that they met now like long-lost friends . Even Peter looked less sullen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard him asking Malcolm about his books  --  word had spread quickly , she thought dryly  --  while Joe Forbes was teasing Jenny about her hair , which she 'd braided into a pigtail . " Going native , huh ? " he said , pointing to a girl on the street with a similar thick braid down her back . " I ca n't wait to buy a Mao jacket and cap , " she told him . " Wait till you see me then ! " " You wish such purchases ? " asked Miss Bai , overhearing her . " I will arrange for a visit to a department store tomorrow . " " Wonderful , " breathed Jenny . " Thanks ! " Xian was the color of the mountains they 'd flown over , terracottaand dusty , with patches of green only in the long lines of newly planted poplar trees and in an occasional rice field . New cement apartment houses were being built , but they were windowlessand unfinished , still outnumbered by the old walled compounds along the road and the tiny mud-and-straw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city through pedestrians and bicyclists , constantly sounding its horn . Entering Xian the landscape changed , the buildings drew closer together , they met with billboards lining each intersection where once Mao 's thoughts must have been inscribed but which now advertisedsoap and toilet paper and toothpaste . This time their hotel sat squarely in the center of town on a busy street . In Canton there had been lingering traces of the Europeaninfluence , hut here the architecture was Russian , a massivesquare hotel built of gray cement with a wall and a sentry at the gate . The Chinese spirit had asserted itself , however , with a huge scarlet sign on which gold letters in Chinese andEnglish proelaitried TI11 ? TIIEOI1ETICAL BASIS GUIDING OUR THINKING IS MAIIXISM AND I.h:NINISM . MAO TSE-TUNG . Iris regarded this in despair . " I 've not read Marx , " she cried . " What was his ail ) ! ( inch to women ? " MRS . POLLIFAX ON 1HE . CHINA STATION 47 " Cautious , " said Malcolm . " I 'll bet yours is , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " or I 'd not be a bachelor . " " Are you really ! " Jenny exclaimed happily . " Not even one very little marriage somewhere ? " Mrs. Pollifax gave Jenny a sharp glance . On the surface she thought Jenny insouciant and lively , yet she 'd begun to notice a strange bite to her words . It was present when she mocked Iris ' clumsiness , and it was in the tone of her voice now , a curious recklessness , a sense of trying too hard . There is a suggestion of desperation here , she thought , and wondered why . Mr. Li interrupted her speculations with an announcement . Dinner , he said , would be served in twenty minutes , and he pointed to the building where it would be served , and for the evening , if they wished , they could stroll to the People 's Park togetherwhile he and Miss Bai worked out their schedule for Xian . Next he explained that there were no keys to the rooms at the People 's Hotel  --  there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their room numbers . " I do n't like there being no keys , " Jenny complained as they climbed the stairs to the floor above . " I think , " said Mrs. Pollifax , " one has to bear in mind that the hotel is run by the government , and there 's a soldier on duty at the entrance , and as you can see , " she added as they reached the second floor , " there 's a chap at a desk to check people . " " But there are so many workers here , " Jenny protested . Malcolm fielded that one . " Plum job , my dear . If it even occurredto one of them to steal something  --  doubtful  --  where would they sell it ? Do n't be so suspicious , " he chided , adding dryly , " this is n't America , you know . Who 's for that stroll after dinner , by the way ? " After one look at her room Mrs. Pollifax decided very firmly to opt for the walk to People 's Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a room so small , so unbelievably dark and hot , with a tiny air-conditioner that made chuckling sounds when she turned it on . She therefore set out with the others following dinner , and falling into step beside Iris she asked how things were going. 48 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONIris did not fail her . " Oh is n't it wonderful ? " she cried , turning to face Mrs. Pollifax and very nearly falling over a stone in her path . " I asked Miss Bai what her first name is . I have it written down somewhere , but in English it means Elder Fragrance , is n't that beautiful ? " " Really lovely , yes , " agreed Mrs. Pollifax , " but I think you 'd better watch out for the holes in this sidewalk , Iris . " " Okay . But what 's with this Peter Fox ? " she asked . " I sat next to him at dinner and I do n't know when I 've met anyone so grumpy  --  unless it was Stanley before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real wet blanket ? " " He may thaw , given time , " said Mrs. Pollifax generously . " It seems his grandmother gave him this trip as a present because she was born in China and ca n't come herself .. I daresay he 'd much rather be off backpacking somewhere with a group of friends . " " If he has any friends , " said Iris . " Well , I can see how he feels , of course , but if somebody gave me a present  --  any kind of present  --  you would n't catch me sulking like that . And a free trip to China  --  wowl " Mrs. Pollifax smiled faintly , noting the words if anyone gave me a present , any kind of present , and reflected that Iris would be too busy giving presents to receive any ; the takers must flock to her like bees to a honey flower . A pity , she thought , and said mischievously , " George Westrum seems very nice . " Iris warmly agreed . " Oh , is n't he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " I think he used to be an FBI man , is n't that in-trigiiing ? " repeated Mrs. Pollifax alertly . " How very excitingl " Iris nodded . " Now all we need is someone from the CIA . " " Yes indeed , " murmured Mrs. Pollifax , without so much as a blink of an eye . " Quite horrid people , I 'm sure . " - 01i there must be some nice people among them , " Iris concededwith her radiant smile and then , glancing ahead , " Look  --  that must be the park , We 're herel Except why are the others hucidlim , iuound tile gatc ? " " Because it costs money , " shouted Malcolm , as Iris called out her ( iuery , crossing the avenue . " The real stuff . Either of you have any ? " MRS . POLLIFAX ON ' IRE CHINA STATION 49 " I have , " Iris announced , joining them . " I bought those white jade cups at Canton airport , remember ? " As the natives gathered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small wrinkled bills and then several coins and presented them to the man . He selected several fen , beamed at her , and issued them tickets . " Now this , " said Joe Forbes as they entered , " has to be the real China . " Mrs. Pollifax was inclined to believe him . There were paths to the right and to the left , but she was drawn instead toward a crowd straight ahead from which , even at a distance , she could hear roars of laughter . Joining it Mrs. Pollifax stood on tiptoe to peer over heads and found them gathered around a television set , a modest and perfectly normal television set plugged into some unseen outlet in the out-of-doors , with cartoons dancing across its screen . Amazing she thought , and looked instead into the faces of the people watching the cartoons , touched by their innocent excitement and joy . The subtitles , however , were in Chinese , and presently  --  still smiling at the pleasure it was giving  --  she moved away to investigatea small growing crowd off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketching . Not far away George Westrumwas attempting sign language with a young woman , with Joe Forbes chuckling at his elbow . At once a young man spotted Mrs. Pollifax and hurried to her side . " You are American too , " he cried eagerly . " I may ask questions ? " " Oh yes , " she told him warmly . " Ni haol Good eveningl " His boldness , his daring , immediately drew people from Malcolm'scircle into his , and Mrs. Pollifax found herself smiled at and approved as the audience waited witli attention for their comrade to address this visitor from a country halfway across the world . Their pride in him was palpable , and Mrs. Pollifax waited too , her heart beating a trifle faster at the importance of this moment . " In America , " he said slowly , his brows knitted together by the seriousness with which he , too , regarded this moment , " you grow cotton ? " Mrs. Pollifax , a little surprised , nodded her head . " Yes . Oh yes . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION " Warm places , " she explained . " Like Canton ? " " Canton ? " He looked bewildered , and she saw that they had suddenly lost their way ; the eagerness still hung between them , tangible but severely threatened . " No , " she said , trying to retrieve direction , " in the United States , where I live . Where  --  " She was suddenly overwhelmed by the nouns , pronouns , verbs that separated them and with which she must frame a sentence , acutely aware too of the perplexities of for and about and from ; the wall between them seemed opaque , the gulf immeasurable , and then with sudden inspiration she remembered the snapshots she had crammed into her purse at the last minute . She reached into her purse and drew them out : a photograph of her apartment house , with herselfstanding in front of it ; several of her grandson opening packagesat Christmas in her living room ; one of Cyrus , and two of her geraniums . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pictures were accepted , people crowded in to peer over his shoulder , they were then distributed by the young man , one by one , moving from band to hand accompanied by murmursof awe and surprise . " Snow ? " asked her friend , pointing to the picture of her standing in frorif of her apartment house . " Yes , " she said , nodding happily . " Yes , snow . Too cold there for cotton . " " Ah  --  I see , I see , " he cried in relief , understanding , and addressed his friends rapidly and with authority . " Husband ? " he asked , pointing to Cyrus . She smiled . " A very dear friend . " " Aha , " he cried joyously , and again addressed the crowd , but it was the photographs of her grandson that drew the most appreciativemurmurs , and she was given glances of deep respect .

" Good night and thank youl Zai flan ! " " Good day , " they called , laughing with her , and as she left they surged again toward Malcolm and his sketchbook . Mrs. Pollifax wandered on along the path , ignoring a charming arched bridge over a pond and drawn toward a mysterious bright light in the distance . Iris , catching up with her , said , " I 'm ready to go back , it 's growing dark . " " Hi there , " called jenny , emerging from a side path . " Going back ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not until I 've investigated that bright light ahead . I 'm curious  --  I noticed it when we entered the park and it 's still there . " " Noises , too , " contributed Iris as they strolled toward it . " Of people ? " asked jenny doubtfully . " Weird sounds , " Iris decided . " People and engines . An adventurefor us maybe ? " " Definitely , " said Mrs. Pollifax happily . " Let 's look and find out . " Out of the darkness , the light emerging from its interior , appeared a circular wooden structure with steps leading to the top and the silhouette of heads lining a platform that encircled the structure . " Yes , yes , " said the solitary attendant leaning against a step , and untied a rope to allow them free entry . They mounted narrow precipitous wooden stairs  --  up , up , toward the suffused brilliant light  --  to find themselves peering down into an arena with gently sloping sides . " Good heavens , " breathed Iris , " it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Mrs. Pollifax braced herself as the cyclists cirel d higher and higher , engines roaring , the platform creaking and trembling and shuddering under her feet . The cyclists became perpendicular now , and for one moment she thought they might52 MRS .

" " So was that platform , " commented Jenny . " It felt like an upside-downbushel basket and just as frail . I was scared to death . " " Never mind , it was fun , " breathed Iris , her eyes shining . Already the lights were being extinguished all over the park ; nothing was wasted , it was nine o'clock , the television screen was dark , the park emptying . They walked out onto the avenue where the small garish lamps of the vendors shone like fireflies in the darkness . People lingered , chatting , under the dim light of the occasional streetlamp , some strolling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now which way did we come ? " asked Iris .

' I'hcy readied , eventually , the broad avenue on which they bad expected to find the People 's hotel , but there was no hotel . lwavad they ntct with it sea of people strolling down the center of it toad in a silence broken only by the shuffling sounds of their feet . Thet e were no cars . As they continued walking there wasMRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 53no hotel , either . They were looked at with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident ? " Mrs. Pollifax asked jenny . " Oh yes , " said jenny , and then spoiled such assertiveness by pausing to say to a young man , " Do you speak English ? " He smiled , shook his head , and hurried on . So did they , but after three more blocks Mrs. Pollifax 's skepticism had turned into alarm ; she decided the time had come to try that universal language of the hands . She stopped two men , and laid her head on her hands in a manner that she hoped denoted sleep . " Ho-tel ? " she asked . " Hotel ? " The two men nodded happily and turned to point in the directionahead of them . " Xiexie , " she said , bowing . But another block still produced no hotel , and Mrs. Pollifax began to picture them sleeping in a doorway for the night , began to look down narrow alleys and into mysterious entrances that led to wooden doors , speculating on how long a tourist might be lost in Xian , and longing passionately for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I do n't see a damn thing ahead resembling a hotel . Let me try . " " But I 'm supposed to have such a good bump of direction , " wailed jenny . " Well , coming to China has dislocated it , I think , " said Mrs. Pollifax . " Ho-tel ? " asked Iris , stopping three men and repeating Mrs. Pollifax 's symbol for sleep . At once Iris drew a crowd ; they became surrounded by faces made dim and unearthly in the near-darkness , faces marveling at Iris ' height , a few women tittering behind their hands ; it turned into a party , and a few minutes later a dozen of the young men escorted them half a block farther , smiling and murmuring " hotel " and pointing , and there  --  at last  --  was the hotel , with its sentryand its gate . Bows , thank yous , and smiles were exchanged , they passed through a deserted lobby , mounted stairs , and Mrs. Pollifax enteredher small hot room with its chuckling air-conditioner . The temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CIIINA STATIONtwenty-five-watt light in the lamp depressing . Kneeling beside her suitcase she unlocked and opened it to return the camera she 'd extracted from it before walking to the park , and suddenly became very still , the movement of camera to suitcase arrested . Her suitcase had been opened and searched while she was gone . A long time ago she had worked out a formula for packing , and although efficiency had been only a minor reason for this she had automatically continued to pack in a certain way even when there was no necessity for caution . She had felt there was no need for caution on this trip , but apparently she had been wrong . Her suitcase had been unlocked very expertly , and very professionally and discreetly searched , but whoever had done the job could n't possibly have known of her packing formula . When she had snatched the camera from her suitcase after dinnerher bright red pajamas had as usual been folded up with the pajama bottoms underneath the pajama tops  --  that was the importantdetail  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now the pajama bottoms were on top , and both toothbrushand comb had vanished somewhere into her suitcase . Now this , thought Mrs. Pollifax , abruptly sitting down on the floor , is a pretty kettle of fish , and completely unexpected . Who , she wondered , could have done this ? She could not believe it had been a worker in the hotel ; opening a locked suitcase without leaving behind so much as a scratch was an art denied to the average person . The police ? But Mr. Li had handled Customs , and at the borderno one had felt any need to question her about her remarkablesupply of vitamins and dried fruit . I ler mysterious coagent ? But whoever he was there seemed no need for him to investigate her ; he had the advantage of knowingwho she was , as well as what she 'd brought with her . What a heivildering finish to a delightful evening , she thought , and realized that she felt thoroughly jarred by this . I do n't understand it , she reflected , and I do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not allow herself to complete that thought , and hastilychew out her pajamas. 5 " MAY WE SEE THE sKETC:HI:S you did last evening in the park ? " Mrs. Pollifax asked Malcolm at breakfast . He said ruefully , " I ended up giving them all away to my audience . We certainly attract crowds , do n't we ? " He smiled across the table at Iris , who flushed as usual but managed one of her radiant smiles in return . " Quite a schedule today , " commented Joe Forbes , spearing a peanut between his chopsticks . " Yes indeed , " she said . Miss Bai had pinned to the dining room wall a calendar of events for their stay in Man , presented in flawless calligraphy , but to Mrs. Pollifax the most important news was that after trips to the Bell Tower and to the Wild Goose Pagoda , they were going to visit the Drum Tower . For the Drum Tower Mrs. Pollifax still had no plans . How very easy and natural the assignment had seemed to her when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia , and how very different it looked now that she was in Xian ! She bad absolutely no idea what obstacles were going to greet her , or even whether she would be able to find Guo Musu 's barbershop . She dared not ask about a barbershop near the Drum Tower or she would be shown it  --  if it existed  --  in the company of Mr. Li or Miss Bai . She had finally accepted the fact that she could assembleno strategy whatever in advance , which was not the happiest56 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CFIINA STATIONway to approach such an important moment , or the Drum Tower either , or Guo Musu if he could be found , but Mrs. Pollifax had a great deal of faith : something would occur to her . A miracle would take place . Yes , definitely a miracle , she told herself firmly . In the meantime they were going to visit Ban Po Village this morning , which would please Iris , and a department store , which would please jenny 's desire for Mao cap and jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her too , that this was a perfectly normal day with the afternoon of no particular significance , and that her suitcase had not been searched the night before . At Ban Po Village they were ushered into a briefing room and seated at a long table with a tea cup placed squarely in front of each chair , and while they sipped hot tea the resident guide deliveredfacts to them , translated into English by Miss Bai .. . the site discovered accidentally in 1953 ... the foundations of forty-five houses with remarkably preserved pottery and tools ... in existence from 6o8o B.C. to 56oO B.C .... evidence of its being a matriarchal society .. . Released from the tyranny of the briefing , Mrs. Pollifax consideredthose- facts . She decided that facts could not possibly describe the drama of workmen starting to build a factory here and discovering instead the remains of an **29;11987;TOOLONG . Strolling along the walkways of the building that sheltered the excavation , she tried to come to grips with eight thousand years of time and failed . Eight thousand was only a number , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but what did come to her  --  like a lingering fragrance across the years  --  wits the intelligence at work here : the intricately worked out trenches between the houses , the playful designs etched into pottery , the hnrial of dead children in huge egg-shaped pottery urns , its if to return them , she thought , to the embryo from which divy 'd entered life . It gave her a pleasant feeling of pride in the human race . She wondered what archaeologists in the year A.D. 10,000 would find when they uncovered the relics of the twentiethccnhcry ; would there , she wondered , be any signs of intelligenceremaining ; ? or ortly vestiges of folly and violence ? MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 57On the drive back to Xian she began to feel oppressively hungry . Miss Bai was explaining to Peter and jenny the government'scurrent Five Stresses  --  civilization , morality , order , cleanliness , and manners , and the Four Beautifications  --  of thought , language , heart , and environment  --  and Mrs. Pollifax was ashamed of herself for yawning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she complained to Joe Forbes , sitting next to her . " Peanuts for breakfast ? " he quipped amiably . " But I also had a hard-boiled egg , " she protested . Malcolm called across the aisle , " I 'd say it 's the chopsticks . You may think you eat a lot  --  " Iris turned around in the seat ahead and said , " But she 's the most expert of us all , have n't you noticed ? " She beamed at Mrs. Pollifax . " Was n't Ban Po Village tremendous ? I hope I did n't monopolize the guide , but honestly  --  eight thousand years ! I mean the Qin Shi Huang Tombs we see tomorrow are only 2 oB.C. , , " Practically contemporary , " put in Malcolm mischievously . " Possibly it 's culture that 's giving us an appetite ? " But Mrs. Pollifax 's eyes were on George Westrum who was seated next to Iris , and who had turned now to give Iris a glance that startled Mrs. Pollifax . She thought : George is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a peculiar word to choose but it was the word that had slid into her head : adoration , she mused . Devotion . Worship . The alliances that were beginning to form had already begun to interest her . The infants , for instance  --  as Malcolm continued to call Peter and jenny  --  bad at once formed a twosome . Iris talked to everyone , but Mrs. Pollifax noticed how often George Westrum managed to sit next to her , his face inscrutable , his eyes watching every play of expression across her vivid face . When Malcolm joined them George 's eyes shifted to Malcolm 's face , again without expression . Iris appeared to regard Malcolm with some caution and blushed a great deal , but Mrs. Pollifax was n't sure whether it was his charm or his book writing that dazzled her . As for Joe Forbes , Mrs. Pollifax admitted that she 'd not yet fathomed him at all . He was always with them  --  smiling and58 MRS . POLLWAX ON ' IHE CHINA STATIONamiable  --  and often contributing a brief comment or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wondered if anyone else had noticed this . Not consciously , she decided , but his personalityhad so little impact that once or twice she 'd caught someone adding , " Oh yes , and Joe too . " She wondered if this meant that he was the agent who would eventually approach her after her attempt this afternoon at the Drum Tower . Her knowledge of professional agents was limited and theatrical , but she had heard that certain full-time agents took great pains to rub out their personalities and achieve anonymity ; perhaps this became habitual , and the loss of personality irreversible . Except , of course , for John Sebastian Farrell , she thought with a smile , who only heaped new layers of personality on his own to gloriously and cheekily distract . She was still smiling , still thinking of Farrell , when they drew up to the department store in Xian . " A real department store ? " asked jenny skeptically . Mr. Li assured her that yes this was a real one , where the Chinesepeople shopped . " But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have forty minutes to look . " " Forty minutes ! " wailed jenny . " To find a Mao cap and jacket ? Peter wants to buy them , too . Oh yes , and Joe , " she added . " Miss Bai  --  ? " Miss Bai nodded . " I 'll go with them . " " Anyone else ? " No one else had any pressing needs . They entered the store togetherto immediately veer off in different directions . The first floor was high-ceilinged and large and struck Mrs. Pollifax as curiously empty , which was puzzling to her because throngs of people lined the counters . She realized she was associating it with American department stores , which were all color , movement , and glamorous displays , and at once felt penitent . Turning right site began it tour of the broad and dusty aisles , hungering for color to relieve the dull greens and grays and blues , and was suddenly brought to a standstill by a wall that blazed with color . " Books , " she whispered in delight : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their jackets bloomed like flowers . SheWMRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 59moved toward them , and the people crowding around the counter made room for her . " Xiexie , " she said quietly , taking her place . But she was a foreigner , after all , and the clerk hurried to her , smiling . Mrs. Pollifax thought , I 'll buy one , I 'll buy a book as my souvenir here . She pointed to a paperback with a jacket design that stood out from the others because it did not have an illustrationof a soldier , or a girl and a boy . " ' That one , " she said , drawn by its black and white lines splashed with abstract yellowsand starlets . The girl 's hands hovered , then dropped . She picked out a cream-colored book next to Mrs. Pollifax 's choice and placed it in her hands . " No , " said Mrs. Pollifax politely . " No , not this one . " She shook her head and then glanced down at the book and opened it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it was a purse-sized atlas of China , the cities and towns marked in Chinese with not a single English word to be seen , and therefore incomprehensibleand useless to her . On the other hand , she mused , it could make a lovely souvenir for her grandson , who would be pleased and amused by it . " I 'll take it , " she said , nodding , " but I 'd also like  --  " and she pointed again to the charming cover that had originally caught her eye . Several more books were picked up and put down before the one she wanted was achieved . It turned out to be a recipe book , also in Chinese , but with lavish color photos at the back . " I 'll take both , " she said , holding up two fingers and smiling . Reaching for her purse the crowd drew closer while she and the salesgirl sorted through her Chinese cin-rcncy for the Yuan that would purchase one recipe book an ( one book of maps . And then  --  suddenly jarred  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated , the wort trigging at her mind , and she picked up the atlas and looker again at its competently waterproofcream jacket . This time she opened it more thoughtfully . On page one she found a map of the entire country , with each province in a different color . She could recognize the XinjiangAutonomous Region because of its size  --  enormous  --  and its location in the northwest corner . After studying the shape of it6o MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONshe turned the pages until she found the identical shape on page thirty-eight . Which means , she thought in amazement , that I 'm actually staring at a map of Xinjiang Province with all its roads laid out in front of me and marked , and all its towns and villages identified , even if their names are written in Chinese , which I ca n't read . But Guo Musu  --  if she found him  --  could read them . And standing there in the middle of China , in a department store in Shaanxi Province surrounded by eavesdroppers and interestedspectators , Mrs. Pollifax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveled up from her toes and emerged as a luxurious , Cheshire-cat smile that lighted up her face . Her miracle had just happened . " I 'll buy two of these , " she told the clerk , holding up the atlas , and reached into her purse for another yuan . To the others , back in the bus , she showed only her recipe book . Peter , Jenny , and Joe Forbes were happily wearing their new Mao caps and jackets ( " show and tell time , " laughed Jenny ) ; Iris had bought a bright enameled mug , Malcolm an ink stick , and George a handkerchief with Xian printed on it . " A taste of the consumer life , " commented Malcolm dryly , " to keep us from suffering withdrawal pangs . " They lunched . They visited a cloisonne factory where they had a long tea-and-briefing , due mainly to Iris asking far too many questions about workers ' hours and wages ; they were led through dark and dusty halls to watch cloisonne jewelry intricatelycrafted , and then to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tower , and the Wild Goose Pagoda , except that by midafternoon it was so hot that only Jenny and Peter climbed the eight stories to its peak . And then in late afternoon they came to the Drum Tower , and Mrs. Pond ax 's moment of truth had arrived. 6MRS . POLLIFAX DESCENDED LAST OF ALL from the minibus , tryingnot to remember that she 'd flown halfway around the world for this moment . She found that her heart was beating much too quickly , and she forced herself to close her eyes and remind herself that que sera sera , and that , after all , a thousand years from now  --  Following these incantations she opened her eyes and looked around her . They were parked in a dusty narrow alley , surrounded by earthen walls . Off to her left she saw the high , lacquer-tiled roofs of what had to be the Drum Tower . Between this and the bus lay a maze of mud-and-straw walls , interrupted here and there by alleys leading into a mysterious interior . There was no barbershop ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , there were only walls . No panic please , she told herself , and smiled at a small roundfacedchild who grinned back at her . She called to Mr. Li , " I 'm going to take some pictures of children , I 'll catch up with you in a minute . " Having said this she knelt in the dust and began dramaticallysnapping pictures with a camera that was completely empty of film . As the others moved away down the dusty lane she slipped into the nearest alley and , with several of the childrentrailing her , began to look for a barbershop . She was soon completely lost and gave herself up to the luxuriousfeeling of being on her own again , free of the group but62 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONcherishing too the assumption that somewhere  --  somehow  --  there would be a way out of this maze of clay-colored walls . In the meantime it was fascinating to be inside them instead of looking at them from the outside : to glance into dark rooms and tiny courtyards , assess the herbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust to draw figures with a stick or a stone . She passed two ancient men playing cards , one of them with a marvelous wisp of goatee on his chin , like a mandarin ; she smiled and nodded to them and received courtly bows in return . Threading her way through one lane after another she turned left , then right , stopping now and then to take a pretend-picture of a flower , a doorway , a child , until at last she entered a much broader alley to find herself virtually under the roofs of the Drum Tower but still inside the compound 's walls . Here at least there were markets : stalls and shops carved into the clay wall behind them , and people , far too many people . She walked slowly down this wider road , nodding and smiling to passersby , trying not to notice the number who came to their doors to watch her , or that slight edginess she felt at being so conspicuous . She passed a bicycle repair shop ; she passed a stall in which an ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of steaming noodles . And then  --  quite suddenly  --  she found herself passing a barbershop . She tried not to stare . Her quick glance noted an exterior of crumbling adobe that matched the wall into which it was set , a large , very dusty glass window , an open door and a dim interior filled with men . Only the chair placed near the window identified it , and the man with clippers bent over his customer in the chair . Here is a barbershop , thought Mrs. Pollifax , but not where I thought it would be , or where Carstairs and Bishop thought it would be , either . She continued past it , glanced into a shop filled with women working at a long workbench , and finding neither an exit from this alley or another barbershop she stopped . She thought , " If it 's not Guo Mnsu in there  --  well , that 's why I was chosen , is n't it ? Because I stand up well under police interrogations ? " MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 63But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither of whom realized the quantities of people on the move in China in the daytime , and the total lack of privacy anywhere . People on the street , people crowded into a barber shop ... they had certainly not considered the effect of an American tourist plunging in among the crowds to ask for information . It was outrageous and it might prove suicidal , but she was going to have to go into that shop . She turned and retraced her steps to its door . A dozen men seated along the wall gaped at her as she walked inside . She called out , " Does anyone here speak English ? " The barber was intent on guiding clippers around the ears of his customer ; he had scarcely glanced up at her arrival and her heart sank at the lack of response . She began again . " Does anyonehere  --  " The barber lifted his head and looked at her . " I speak a little . " He was a nondescript , sallow man , his face devoid of expression . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't feel . " I 'm lost . I wonder if you could come to the door  --  " here she pointed , " and show me the way to the Drum Tower ? " The man spoke to his companions in his own language ; heads nodded and the smiles blossomed so ardently that for a minute she feared they might all jump up to help her . But the barber had put down his clippers and he joined her alone in the doorway . " Please  --  come outside , " she said in a low voice . " Are you Guo Musu ? " He stiffened . " How is this , please , " he whispered , " that you know my name ? " They were being watched with interest by a circle of bystandersin the alley , and by the men behind them in the barbershop . In spite of their being out of earshot she knew that she must be careful and protect this man , whether he helped her or not . She asked , " Which way to the Drum Tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been heading ; she hoped this gesture established authenticity , but it was going to be difficult to remember appropriate gestures while she talked . " There is n't much time , " she said quickly . " Your brother64 MRS . POLLIFAX ON TILE CHINA STATIONChang , who reached Hong Kong safely , said you could tell me where the camp is located that you lived in for three years . The labor camp somewhere in Xinjiang Province . " " Chang ! " he exclaimed . " Labor camp ? " Damn , she thought , and deplored this lack of time and privacy , he 's going to need time to adjust to this , the shock could n't have been greater if I announced that I came from the moon . " I 'm visiting your country , " she told him politely . " We 're enjoyingXian very much . We saw Ban Po Village this morning , and tomorrow we visit the tomb of  --  " Amusement flickered in his eyes ; she had underestimated him . He said , " And you have somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think , " she told him frankly . " You could be arrested for giving me this information but I can also be arrested for asking you . " An ironic smile crossed his face . " I 'm American , " she told him . " It 's Americans who would like to know . " " Americans , " he repeated , turning the word over on his tongue . " And just what do you expect of me ? " There was a very real irony in his voice now . She said earnestly , " What I thought  --  what I hoped  --  I bought an atlas this morning in Xian , with Xinjiang Province on page thirty-eight . Let me show you . " She turned to page thirty-eight and handed it to him . " If you decide to trust me I thought we might walk a little  --  away from your shop and your neighbors  --  and I could hand you a pen . " He looked at her , studying her with curiosity and interest . The irony slowly receded ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you to the end of the road and show you the way to the Drum Tower . " " Oh thank you , " she gasped , adding quickly , " You 're very kind . " He said politely , " Not at all . " As they walked he glanced down at the map of Xinjiang Province , whereas Mrs. Pollifax glanced back , relieved to see that only a few of the smaller children followed , but at a distance . Nearing the end of the alley he looked up from the atlas and metMRS . POLLIFAX ON THi CHINA STATION 65her gaze . Wordlessly she offered him the pen , leaning closer to him so that no one would see . He gravely accepted it . " I 'll keep talking , " she told him as he made a mark on the map , and without watching him she began a pantomime of gesturesand smiles . After a moment he slipped the atlas back into her hand , and she slid it into her purse . Bringing out her identical copy she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , this is a duplicate , " she said , presenting it to him with a bow . " Look at page thirty-eight and you 'll see . " He turned to that page , and she saw his relief . " Please take it , " she told him . " As a gift . For showing me the way to the Drum Tower . " " For showing you the way to the Drum Tower , " he repeated , and suddenly smiled , showing a number of teeth capped in steel . " And Chang ? " he asked , his irony exquisite now . " He is well ? " " I am told he is very well , " she said , smiling back at him , and suddenly she was aware of the immensity of what he had dared to do for her , and she seized the book he held and wrote her name in it . " Now each of us knows , " she told him . " It 's only fair . We 're hostages now to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " he told her gently . Startled , she said , " Oh ? " " Your eyes speak for you , which is why I do this , " he said . " I think it is possible that you also follow The Way . " She had forgotten that he was Buddhist . " I seek , " she acknowledgedsoftly , " but sometimes  --  oh , in very strange ways . " His smile was warm . " But there are no strange ways , xianben  --  only the search . " " Ah , " she said with a catch of breath , and for a long moment they gazed at each other and she was mute , deeply touched by a recognition , a tenderness between them . She said at last , very softly , " Thank you , Mr. Guo , and  --  please  --  may you have long life and double happiness . " He nodded and walked away , once again a sallow nondescript man , no doubt wearing an ironic smile for the comrades who moved eagerly toward him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONshe 'd given him , and as his neighbors drew close to examine it she left . Presently she was mounting the steps to the Drum Tower . Mr. Li was waiting at the entrance . " Where have you been ? " he demanded . " Miss Bai has gone to search for you . " She only smiled at him , and moved past him . She found the others in the small Friendship Store at the top of the building , looking into glass cases at ancient relics displayedfor sale . Not one of them looked up at her entrance , and she commended her silent partner for being so controlled and disciplined an actor . But although she too concentrated on the relics with control and discipline , her thoughts remained with Guo Musu and on that curious sense of meeting that she 'd experiencedwith him . Nothing happens by accident , she thought , and she knew that she would not easily forget that moment of tenderness between them . And she had succeeded . Her job was done . She 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhilaration in this , and a sense of triumph . They attended Chinese Opera that evening . Mrs. Pollifax , tired from the suspense and from the tensions of finding Guo Musu , found Jenny and Peter extremely irritating . In spite of being several years older , it was Jenny who seemed to be succumbingto Peter 's hostile attitudes : they had moved from an early sharing of college jokes and anecdotes to a running patter of tactless criticisms of China that Mrs. Pollifax found deplorable . She had already overheard a few whispered flippancies about Mr. Li , and only that morning they 'd been giggling about the questions Iris had asked at the cloisonne factory 's tea and briefing . Now it was the Shaanxi local opera that met with their unkind laughter . N1rs. 1ollifax herself was entranced . The theater was shabby and the audience in dull work clothes , but the stage shone like a jewel with the brilliance of the costumes  --  color for the eye at last , she thought , as she feasted on it . Mr. Li had explained to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begunMRS . POLLIFAX ON ' IRE CHINA STATION 67three nights ago ; it would last four hours tonight , but they would depart at intermission . Mrs. Pollifax found no problems at all in following it : the gestures were stylized but the meaning of each one , coupled with the droll and vivid expressions on the actors ' faces needed no words of explanation . There was a marvelous humor in the story , and she laughed along with the audience without the slightest idea of what was being said . Jenny , however , was not content with this and demanded of Mr. Li a translation of every word spoken , after which she would repeat his explanation in a loud voice for the rest of them . " So this guy  --  the one in black , " she was saying , " has come down from heaven to avenge the death of  --  which one , Mr. Li ? " " Get a load of the singing ! " interrupted Peter , laughing . " Straight through the nasal passages , vibrating all the sinuses ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sniffles into her sleeves , the one in bright red ? " Ugly Americans , thought Mrs. Pollifax sadly , and was about to speak to them when George Westrum surprised and impressed her by turning around and doing it first . " Look here , " he growled , " you 're not giving this a chance , and you 're being damned rude , too . " Mrs. Pollifax glanced around and saw that Jenny had the grace to blush but Peter 's face only turned cold and stony again . They stopped their chattering and Mrs. Pollifax returned to the opera , but something had gone out of the evening . She realized that the first rift had appeared in their group , and the embarrassment of it hung in the air , an embarrassment for themselves , for Mr. Li , for China , and for Peter and Jenny . It was not a comfortableway to feel , thought Mrs. Pollifax , and when they left at the intermission there were no comments about the opera on their way back to the hotel . The silence was awkward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night to Jenny and Peter . She had been alone in her room for only a few minutes when the door opened , startling her . She turned her head to see Peter walk in without knocking and she was appalled at this breach of manners ; not even the assumption that he might have come to apologize dampened her sense of outrage . She said angrily , 68 MRS . POLLIFAX ON Tmi CHINA STATION " Whether you realize it or not , Peter , it 's customary to knock . " He stood there , arrogant , cold , and sulky . He closed the door behind him and without paying her words any attention he walked across the room and tucked the curtains more securely around the air-conditioner . Only then did he turn and say quietly , in a voice she 'd never heard from him before , " I 've come to ask if you made contact with Guo Musu today . " 7MRS . POLLIFAX STARED AT HIM INCREDULOUSLY . " You ? " shegasped . " You ! " He stood silent , watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she flung at him . " You 're only twenty-two , how could you possibly be one of Cars  --  " She stopped . " One of Carstairs ' people , " he finished for her . She stared at him in shock , her mind spinning in an effort to adjust : not Joe Forbes , not Malcolm Styles , not George Westrum . She said , feeling her way toward something concrete , " You ca n't possibly speak Chinese or  --  " " Fluently . Mandarin as well as several dialects . " " There was that grandmother  --  " " Oh yes , that grandmother , " he said with a faint smile . " Born in Kansas City , Missouri , actually , and the closest she 's come to China is Mah-Jongg . " " What 's more I 've disliked you , " she told him angrily . " I did n't realize how much until you walked in just now without knocking . Spoiled , sulky , unappreciative  --  " " That good , huh ? " Mrs. Pollifax began to laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right  --  very good , and I 'm acting like an idiot . " She held out her hand to him . " I 'm sorry . " His handclasp was firm . " It was a shock for me when I first70 MRS . POLLIFAX ON 111E CHINA STATIONsaw you too , " he conceded politely . " I wo n't say where it was , but definitely it was a shock . " " That bad , huh ? " she mimicked , smiling at him . " Then shall we start all over again before getting on with the job ? " " If there is a job , " he said quietly . " Look , the suspense has been damn hard to handle , I did n't see any barbershop at all near the Drum Tower . " She nodded . " Then I 'm delighted to tell you that there was a barbershop and a Guo Musu , too . " " My God , " he said , staring at her . " Where ? " " Hidden away in that maze of alleys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he  --  " She nodded . " It 's in my purse , excuse me . " " What 's in your purse ? " She reached across him to the bedside table , groped for the atlas and brought it out . " Page thirty-eight , " she said , opening it and handing it to him . He stared at it in amazement . " Where on earth did you get a Chinese atlas ? " " In the department store this morning , " she told him . " Quite by accident . I pointed to what I thought would be a book of poems arid they handed me this instead . It was a miracle . " As he leaned over page thirty-eight Peter 's face was no longer impassive . " It 's a miracle all right , " he said , and glanced up at her . " Have you looked at this ? Guo 's not only marked the location of the labor camp but he 's added notes . " " Notes ? " she echoed , and Guo 's face returned to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He did that for us , too ? " she said , with a catch in her voice . " I 'll say ! " He showed her the page , excited now . " He 's pinpointedthe labor camp halfway between Urumchi , where we go tomtit low , and ' I'urfan  --  just off the main highroad over the Tian Shan mountains . But what 's even more fantastic , he 's scribbled a footnote explaining the circle he 's drawn , he says it marks a Red Army barracks some six or eight miles from the labor camp . " He looked at her and shook his bead . " Flow did you manage all this ? You were missing for only about forty-five minutes this afternoon . I mean , you 're one hell of a surprise . " MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 71 " Thank you , " she said . " No , I mean it , " he told her . " To get all this in minutes from an absolute stranger ? Since reaching Xian I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have managed it . I wanted to , you know , I insisted on doing it myself but Carstairsrefused . This morning I realized I 'd have behaved like a bull in a tea shop . Spoken Chinese probably , alarmed Guo Musu thoroughly , even given the whole show away and gotten nowhere . How did you do it ? " " It 's probably why they sent me , " said Mrs. Pollifax modestly . " The Chinese do have a deep respect for their elders , after all , and I tend to look quite harmless . " He grinned . " That 's for sure  --  you fooled me . And now  --  " He hesitated , staring down at page thirty-eight . " It 's incredible but I think we 're in business at last . I can even get down to some seriousplanning now . Amazing . " She smiled at him . " Good  --  but did you by any chance search my suitcase last night ? " He looked at her blankly . " Search your  --  why should I want to search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sinking heart . " It was n't you , then ? " " No of course not . " Peter looked shocked . " Are you sure ? " " Oh yes . Somebody did . Was yours ? " He shook his head . " No , I take the usual precautions . I 'd have known right away . " His brows drew together into a frown . " I do n't get it , who would do such a thing , and why ? And why you ? " " It was done very professionally , " she told him , " and it would n't have been noticeable at all if I did n't have my own way of packing , too . The lock was n't picked , and everything was left in order  --  but not the right order . " His scowl had turned into such a look of alarm that she added softly , " Do n't look so jarred , it was probably some sort of random security check . " She did n't think at all that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worrying Peter just now when he had his plans to make . " In any case , " she told him cheerfully , " I think we should put it aside for the moment , there being other things to think about , do n't you72 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONagree ? Which leads me to a question I 've been waiting for some time to ask you . With enormous curiosity . " She had succeeded in distracting him ; he smiled . " Be my guest and ask , but I 'll bet I know what it is . " She smiled back at him . " I 'm sure you do : the one detail no one 's mentioned , and which did n't seep through to me until too late to ask . You 're going to be escorting our friend Mr. Wang  --  X  --  out of the country , are n't you . " She did n't even bother to make it a question . He nodded . " Then as a bona fide member of a bona fide guided tour , allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to manage to vanish from the tour and gain freedom for your very risky undercover work ? I ca n't believe that you 'll just bolt . You would n't have a chance , would you ? " He shook his head . " Not a chance in a million . No , there 'll be an accident . " " Accident , " she repeated , watching his face intently . " What kind ? " " That 's up to me , " he told her . " I 've a few ideas boiling around in my head but it depends on a lot of factors like terrain and circumstances and timing . I 'll be killed , " he added casually . " Killed , " she repeated , and waited . " In such a way there 'll be no trace of a body , " he explained , adding soberly , " and it 's growing on me fast that your help is going to be very much needed . " " I see , " she said musingly . " Yes , it would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vanish into China . " " Yes  --  become a non-person . Without the Sepos in hot pursuit . A dead person . " She shivered . " Not easy . " " No . " " And from the vitamins and dried food I 'm carrying I deduce you 'll he heading for the mountains ? " Ile nodded . " There 's been the feeble hope that another route might open up , but I do n't think it will . " " Very high mountains , " she said quietly . " And cold ones . Surely not through Tibet ? " MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 73 " No , we can head around the Taklamakan desert toward Khotan and a pass over the Karakaroms . " " The very thought chills me , " she admitted . " Literally as well as figuratively . " He nodded . " That 's where I 'll need your help , too ; you can help me find warm clothing and carry some of it in your suitcase when mine 's full . " " Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pencil , glad to move her thoughts toward the practical . He frowned as he concentrated . " What I did smuggle in is small stuff . I 've got thermal underwear , two heavy ski masks rolled up , fake papers , and a heavy sweater . The windbreaker jacket I brought has a second one zipped inside it . I 've knives , flashlights and batteries , a good compass hidden in my camera , topographical maps , complete medicine kit right down to snake serum , and two collapsible canvas bags for water  --  " " Plus the chocolate I brought , the dried foods , and vitamins  --  " " Yes . And now what 's needed is more of the big stuff . Blankets and sheepskins  --  anything that can be cut into vests and coats . We 're heading tomorrow into nomad country where there ought to be sheepskins in the bazaars or Friendship Stores . Buy whatever you find , you can refuse to have it mailed home for you until we get to Beijing , make up some sort of story , rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with you . " Right , " she said crisply , noting this down on paper . " In the meantime , " he added with a crooked smile , " I have my Mao cap and jacket , and they were very nearly top priority , believe me , because I shall have to become as Chinese as a nativesoon . " " How on earth did you learn fluent Chinese at such an age ? " she asked . " It 's unexpected . " " Very weirdly , " he told her . " When I was into my freshman year at Harvard  --  yeah , Harvard , " he admitted with a grin , " I started out hanging around bars in Chinatown in Boston . Coincidence ? I do n't know . And I began picking up the language bit by bit  --  with an ease that staggered me . Coincidence ? I do n't know . By the time I graduated from Harvard I could read and74 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONwrite Mandarin , and was already into dialects , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished my senior year . I 'm in graduate school now  --  their Far Asian studies department  --  or was , until I took off to get in shape for this . " " And Carstairs ? " He grinned . " No , it was Bishop . I met him in a Chinatown bar in Boston , or perhaps  --  who knows ?  --  he arranged to meet me there because he 'd heard of me . A setup maybe . " She smiled . " Quite possibly . And here we are . " " Yes . And now I have this , " he said , looking down at the atlas with astonishment . " I 'll take it along to my room and figure kilometersfrom the map I brought , and do some calculations . " " Did anyone see you come into my room ? " asked Mrs. Pollifax , remembering her searched suitcase , and still uneasy about it . He shook his head . " The hall was empty . " He thought a minute . " If anyone 's in the hall when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrow a drinking glass . But tell me first  --  I 'm curious  --  what was Guo Musu like ? " She told him , describing the barbershop and their meeting , and as she talked she became aware of several quick , perceptive glances directed at her , as if he understood much more than she was saying , and for this she was grateful . When she had finished he nodded . " I wish I could have talked with him . It 's been terribly frustrating , " he added , with a rush of boyish candor . " The opera tonight , for instance . I really hated Jenny 's running commentary when I could understand every word for myself , and I came near to hating her for demeaning it . I 've also overheard and understood everything that Mr. Li and Miss Rai talk about together , and I feel like a bloody eavesdropper . Mr. Li , " he said ruefully , " does n't think very highly of nun either . " Ile stood up . " I 'll go along now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " It might be a good idea for us to become a shade friendlier inside the group . In case we 're seen talking together , as we 'll surely have to do from time to time . " " Good , " he said , with a grin . " I 'll begin sitting next to you at meals occasionally , and show signs of thawing . And look , " heMPS . POLLIFAX ON ' HE CHINA STATION 75added almost shyly , " you 've been great . I 'm awfully glad to have finally met you . Really met you , I mean . " She smiled at him warmly . " That goes for me , too . " As he moved to open the door she said , " Hold it a moment , " and ducked into her bathroom . " Your water glass , " she reminded him . He whistled . " You really are a pro ! I forgot , damn it . " And glass in hand he made his exit. 8THEY DROVE THE NEXT MORNING to the tomb of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had once promised to be the highlight of sightseeing for her , Mrs. Pollifax now found it difficult to think of anything but Peter 's visit to her room last night . For one thing , the very magnitude of the job that he 'd been given nearly ' overwhelmed her : to devise his own death , to rescuea stranger from a labor camp and then travel what had to be hundreds of miles over desert and cruel mountain passes seemed incredible . The man whom Peter had been sent to rescue had to be very important indeed , she was thinking , and here , too , she decided there must be a great deal that Carstairs had not told her . And then there was Peter himself . . . She still marveled at his being the agent sent in with her , and she was not at all displeased , but she wished that he 'd not forgotten that drinking glass . It was a trivial omission , but it reminded her of his youth and the fart that this was probably his first job , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good actor , and he was intelligent . From her impressions of him she guessed there was a natural exuberancein him about what lay ahead , and that this would have been the quality that captured Carstairs ' attention , for if she trembled for Peter , she was absolutely certain that Peter did notMRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 77tremble for himself . Behind the impassive face that had softened only slightly last night she had glimpsed that sort of loner who had to climb mountains because they were there , as the saying went , and for whom danger was addicting , and ordinary life puzzling . It was the stuff of which the T. E. Lawrences and Richard Halliburtons were made , she mused , embryonic now in a cool twenty-two-year-old , and obviously invaluable for this particular job . But as an agent , she thought , he should never have forgotten that water glass . And this , she mused , was perhaps another reason why she 'd been chosen to accompany Peter : to keep an eye on him and to steady him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd done by instinct last evening when he 'd looked so alarmed about her suitcase being searched : she had reassured and distracted him , hiding her own alarm . Carstairs , she thought , must have done some rare chuckling when he tossed the two of them into this maelstrom  --  he was no fool about people  --  but at the moment she wished she might have a few indignant words with him . Obviously , her job in China was not to end in Xian , after all . It might even be just beginning . She glanced toward the front of the minibus at Peter , who was seated next to Malcolm this morning , as if he 'd decided to divest himself of Jenny for the day , and she wondered idly what they were talking about . The two guides sat in front of them , with Miss Bai occasionally interrupting her conversation with Mr. Li to pick up the microphone and point out a field of workers , a commune , or a factory . And then  --  abruptly  --  they were pulling into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay a broad courtyard framed by low-lying buildings , the largest of which resembled an airplane hangar . " No cameras allowed , " called out Mr. Li . " No  --  no pictures , " echoed Miss Bai . " We meet here again in one hour , the Friendship Store on the left , a film theater next it showing history of this remarkable discovery , and soda pop to be found in souvenir building . " It was Joe Forbes with whom Mrs. Pollifax strolled toward the hangarlike building that had been erected over the remarkable78 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONdiscoveries . " But this is n't the tomb itself ? " he asked pleasantly . " I do n't believe they 've even started on the tomb yet , " she told him . " These are the burial figures found on the periphery . He took an entire army to the grave with him , but mercifully not a live one , which I do think was kind of him , and very enlight-ened . " " Another discovery , " he quipped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the guidebook , this time it was commune workers digging a well . " Pleasantries from behind plexiglass , she thought , darting a glance at his pleasant , smiling , never-changingface , but knowing now that he was n't Carstairs ' man she felt little need to probe the mystery behind his lack of personality ; there probably was no mystery at all , she decided ; some people were simply born bland . They walked together into the building , where Mrs. Pollifax promptly moved to the railing that separated them from the diggingsite , and here she caught her breath . She had been certain that she knew what to expect ; she had studiously looked up photographsbut now she realized that they 'd been taken out of context , mere pictures in a magazine lacking environment and reality . The sheer impact of what she saw stunned her : hundreds of life-sized men standing below her in the broad trenches that honeycombed the earth floor , men like gray ghosts waiting patientlyat attention , hundreds of them in battle formation lined up in rows as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individualwith here and there a hand lifted or a head turned slightly as if to listen . Silent and waiting they filled the hall , so alive in gesture and stance that surely , she thought , they must be breathing as they stood there , liberated from the earth that had held thorn for nearly two thousand years . Malminl , corning to stand beside her , said simply , " My God . " She smiled , liking Malcolm . " It 's a mighty emperor who goes to his grave with  --  how many ? " she asked . " The latest count is five hundred terra-cotta warriors , six warchariots , and twenty-four horses , with thousands more expected . " Iris , joining them , whistled , and the three of them stood there , staring down into the trenches , absorbed and awed until Mrs.MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 79Pollifax , recovering , began to be aware of a very odd sensation of tension flowing between Malcolm and Iris . Strange , she thought , standing between them . She glanced curiously at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she looked at Iris , but she too was staring straight ahead , her lips still pursed in a whistle , and then George Westrum came up to claim Iris and the tension snapped . But for just a moment Mrs. Pollifax felt that she 'd stumbled into a kind of energy-force field , and since she was not accustomed to picking up vibrations so strongly it left her puzzled . Perhaps this place is a little haunted , she thought , and wondered what had happened to her . Iris and George walked away together and Malcolm wandered on , his sketchbook in hand . When Mrs. Pollifax resumed strolling it was Peter who fell in with her . " Seems a good time to get friendlier , " he said with his wry half-smile . " We leave for Urumchi late this afternoon and I 've been doing my homework . " " Productive ? " she asked , trying not to look eager in case anyone was watching . " Definitely . " His voice was crisp , with an undercurrent of excitement . " It looks good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'm absolutely certain now that the thing can be pulled off , all of it . " With a nod toward the excavations he added , " What do you think ? " " Incredible . Spooky , even , they feel so alive . " " He was a bit of a bastard , that first emperor , " Peter said pleasantly . " Burned books . Executed his friends . Made some pretty severe laws . But , " he added , " the laws he made were the first the country ever had , and one of them was to banish feudalism , even if it did pop back after his death . He pulled a lot of warring states together and gave the country shape and unity , and without all that China might never have tamed the Xiong nu during the next dynasty . " " Tamed who ? " " Hsiung-nu  --  the horse people , the nomads from the steppes who swarmed through the passes of the Altai and Tian Shan ranges to attack . .. Mongols and Turkic people . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into frontier country. 8o MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONUrumchi , Turfan , the Tarim Basin , the Tian Shans , the Taklamakandesert . Back in 221 B.C. it was China 's wild west , the far frontier . " " Genghis Khan , perhaps ? " " Yes , eventually . What riders they must have been , sweeping down from the mountains into the desert , with towns changing hands at the drop of a crossbow ! " " And has it been tamed now ? " she asked , picturing what he spoke of in her mind . " It 's not been made an Autonomous Region for nothing , " he told her . " I gather the central government still has its problems there and has had to make a few compromises . Not easy trying to organize nomads into communes , and Moslems into good Communists . A great number of ethnic groups live there  --  it was the Silk Road , after all !  --  the Uyghurs being in the majority . " " Weegurs ? " she rpeated . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of the language you 'll meet there , most of the words being pronouncedwith strange gargling sounds . For instance the word for good-bye is hox , which you pronounce horrssh , and aromat is thank you , but comes out rock-met , slightly gargled . In any case , Mao tried to solve the Uyghur majority by sending thousands of Chinese into the province to settle among them , but basically it 's Moslem country and they 've had their share of incidents , so-called . " " Uprisings ? " asked Mrs. Pollifax in surprise . " Passive resistance would probably describe it better . In fact , something like sixty thousand Kazakhs simply left China in 1962 , going over the border into Soviet Kazakhstan . " " How absolutely fascinating , " she said . " I wish Mr. Li could be this informative . " Peter shook his head . " You ca n't blame Mr. Li , " he said soberly. " lF rom his age I 'd guess he was brought up during the Cultural Revolution , when education went into an ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its history than he does , though he 's learning fast . " He shook his head again . " These abrupt changes must have been psychological hell for people , at one point raiding monasteries , closing schools , andMRS . POLLIFAX ON TIE CHINA STATION 81sending intellectuals into the fields or to prison ; the next decade opening the schools , retrieving teachers and scientists from the rice fields , and restoring the same buildings that were mutilated . It has a certain Alice-In-Wonderland quality , you know ? Mao may have been a brilliant revolutionary , but he sure as hell lacked consistency for the long run . Oops , here comes jenny , " he said . " I 'd better mend my political fences and talk to her . See you later , " he added quickly , and strolled back toward jenny , his face emptied of expression again . In the afternoon they visited Huaching Hot Springs Guesthouse , from which Chiang Kai-shek had escaped capture by the Communists , leaving his teeth behind . It was a very charming place , with ponds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot ; her feet were tired and she sat down as often as possible and as close to the water as possible . Besides , she thought crossly , Chiang Kai-shek might have escaped from a window to climb the mountain behind his room , but he 'd only been captured and eventually released again . Of much more interest to her was the young Communist who had hurried to Xian to negotiate with Chiang once he was captin-ed . The young man 's name had been Chou En-lai , and Mrs. Pollifax had long since succumbed to Chou 's personality from seeing him on television . She completely understood the reaction to his death in 1976 when the people defied Mao and the police to pour into Beijing 's Tian An Men Square and mourn Chou in their own way . It had been a spontaneous outpouring of national grief and love and worry that had been conspicuously missing when Mao died eight months later . She was seated on a bench thinking about this when Peter strolled up the path and sat down beside her . His face impassive he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' room so I 've got to talk fast . Quick  --  have you pencil and paper ? " She was amused to see that he was speaking out of the corner of his mouth , just like a film gangster . She nodded and dug into her purse , bringing out her memo pad . " I 've been talking to Mr. Li about what we see in Urumchi , 82 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONand it sounds good , as if we 'll be visiting all the right places , but when he confers with you  --  and he will , because you 're leader , remember ?  --  make sure we visit the Kazakhs up in the grasslands after our overnight stay in Turfan . You ca n't possibly know what I mean , and there 's no time to explain so just write it down , okay ? " Mrs. Pollifax wrote TURFAN , SEE FIRST . " Is there a name for the grasslands ? " " Yes , take a look at your Markham Tour brochure if you brought it  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of their regular tours here , and we 've got to insist on them , but after visiting Turfan . If I remember correctly the brochure reads "  --  he closed his eyes and quoted  --  " ' See the colorful Kazakh Minority Peoples demonstratetheir superb horsemanship . A nomadic people , they live in summer in yurts on the grasslands of the Tian Shan mountains . ' And , " he added , " we simply must go there last " " I wonder what reason I could possibly give Mr. Li for this , " she asked pensively . " Tell him , something . Tell him you 've heard how hot Turfan is ... Well , it is , " he said . " It 's five hundred feet below sea level . " " Below ! " she exclaimed . " Yes you 'll find it listed on maps as the Turf an Depression . It 's also an oasis in the desert , and hot . You can tell Mr. Li you 're feeling the heat , or someone is , and it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He smiled faintly . " You seem to manage okay . As leader you 've got clout  --  use it . And if it 's any help , " he added , " Jenny seems to be getting tourist tummy , or Montezuma 's Revenge , or dysentery , whatever the current wordis .. , " Oh dear ! " " Yes . " he nodded and as Jenny appeared from between two ancient buildings he added flatly , " But it 's absolutely necessary we go to Turfan first . Totally . I 'll explain why when we get to Urumchi . " " I 'll look forward to that , " she told him dryly , with the distinctMRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 83feeling it would be much kinder if she avoided hearing that explanation . It was a six-hour flight to Urumchi . The two-engine prop plane fairly bulged with passengers , a few even seated on their luggage in the aisles . A hostess occasionally negotiated her way among them , passing out candies or cups of tea , but for dinner they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air terminal , handed warm moist wash cloths as they entered , and warm moist cloths at the meal 's end . The paper napkins , noticed Mrs. Pollifax , were steadily shrinking in size ; they had not been large in Canton , but they were now approaching the shape of her memo pad , and were slippery as well . Following dinner they returned to the plane and in the hours before darkness Mrs. Pollifaxlooked down at stark , barren mountain ranges , goldenbrownin color like dark honey illuminated by the sun 's gold . Occasionally  --  surprisingher  --  she saw terraces carved out of a mountainside , forming patterns like ripples in a pond but with no sign of villages or of human life anywhere in the incredibly empty landscape . China , she decided , looking down at it , was all terra-cotta and dusty jade . Everywhere . Only the shapes changed , and the shades of beige and brown , and the presence or absence of any green at all . It was night when they landed in Urumchi , and well past ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xian air terminalthere was now a Mr. Kan waiting for them here , and while still in the air terminal Mrs. Pollifax placed herself squarely in front of Mr. Li and reminded him that she was group leader . " When do we discuss plans for Urumchi ? " she asked . If Mr. Li was surprised by this sudden aggressiveness , he concealedit . " In the morning perhaps ? " he suggested . " Mr. Kan will tell us what he 's arranged . " " No , " said Mrs. Pollifax firmly . " Tell him tonight , please , that we all want to visit Turfan before we go to the Kazakh grasslands . I hear that Turfan is very hot , and we 'd prefer the mountainslater , to cool off . " " Cool off ! " he repeated , and laughed merrily at the phrase. 84 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CIIINA STATION " Yes  --  do please insist on it before any plans are made final . " " You wish Turfan soon , " he said , assimilating this . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look that came and went on Mr. Li 's face she received the distinct impression that while he spoke English well he did not understand it with equal ease . " Turfan first , " she repeated , and was made more comfortableby a confirming flash of comprehension in his gaze . He saves face , she thought as she climbed into the waiting minibus . How much has he understood of our prattlings ? How much would I understand if people spoke rapidly , injecting slang words , and in different accents ? Once again the hotel was nearly an hour 's drive out of town , but this time there were no complaints : there was an intimacy about the Yannan that had been missing in the Canton hotel 's oversized Art Deco vulgarity , and in the Xian hotel 's stark Russianfrugality . For one thing there was only a very modest fishpond in the lobby , and through an opened french door a smaller , brighter dining hall could be seen . The guest rooms were at ground level , elevated a few steps above the lobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its walls were white , and on one of them hung a very charming watercolor , an original , with a subtly Turkish flavor to it . Obviously new and interesting influences had entered Xinjiang Province . But although it was nearly eleven o'clock Mrs. Pollifax felt restless , and while she waited for her suitcase to arrive at her door she gravitated toward the lobby , passing the small gift counter on the way . It had been opened for their arrival  --  a young woman presided over it  --  and Iris and George were leaningover the counter examining its treasures . In the lobby she found Malcolm sitting on the edge of the goldfish pond . " Real fish , " he told her , pointing . " How are you doing ? " " Surprisingly well so far , " she told him. " jenny has a touch of traveler 's tummy . I 've given her two of my pills , " he said . " Anyone else , do you know ? " " Not to my knowledge , " she told him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory that somewhere along the line there 's usually one rebellious new employee in a kitchen who just can'tMRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 85understand why the water has to be boiled for foreigners , and so they do n't . One has to count on that , it 's human nature . " He looked amused . " Very experienced of you  --  about human nature , I mean . And since jenny 's been drinking nothing but boiled water  --  " " So-called . " "  --  it 's a very rational explanation . If somewhat alarming , " he added , his glance moving to Iris , who was walking toward them looking excited , with George following behind her , smiling . " Look , " she cried , holding out a hand , " just see what George insisted on buying for mel " In her palm lay a disc of antique white jade , intricately carved by hand . She was radiant as she displayed it . " How exquisite , " breathed Mrs. Pollifax , bending over it . " Lovely , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at Iris . Iris turned pink . " It 's very old , " she said almost defiantly . jenny called from the hallway , " Any suitcases yet ? " " How are you feeling ? " called Malcolm. jenny walked over to join them and he made room for her on the wall of the fishpond . " Better , thanks , but I should never have stashed those pills in my suitcase , we do n't see our luggage that often . Thanks for bailing me out , Malcolm . What 's that ? " she asked Iris . " White jade , is n't it gorgeous ? " The wide glass doors swung open now , and Mr. Li , Mr. Kan , two hotel workers , and Joe Forbes appeared with their luggage . Iris said , " That 's what I 've been waiting for  --  good night everyone , see you in the morning ! George , thanks so very much  --  see youl " George Westrum , looking somewhat startled , tugged at his baseball cap , lingered a minute , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and followed the men and the luggagedown the hall . Mrs. Pollifax , leaning comfortably against the fishpond , said , " I 'm so glad to see Iris given a present , was n't she excited ? I have the impression that she 's not received many gifts in her life . " 86 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONMalcolm said calmly , " She 'll be receiving a good many of them in the future . " Startled , Mrs. Pollifax said , " From George , do you mean ? " " No , not George , " he said , and then , aware of her scrutiny he added , " or did n't I mention that I 'm psychic at times ? " " No , you did n't , " she told him sternly . " You only said that you live with talking mice . " " The two are not synonymous , " he said dryly , " but I can be quite psychic at times . It comes in flashes , and I frequently get very clear intuitions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , a believer of course , " she said . " How can one be otherwise ?

She added lamely , " But we all have the gift , have n't we , simply covered over by rationalism and disbelief ? " He had been smiling at her discomfiture . " You must tell me more sometime about your friend the gypsy but I think I 'll say good night now . Hi , jenny , " he said , as jenny reappeared. jenny gave him a bright but abstracted smile , and at his departurewalked over to the fishpond to sit beside Mrs. Pollifax . She said in a strangled voice , " That white jade . Did George give it to Iris ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jenny pushed out her legs and stared angrily at her blue and white sneakers . There was a long silence while she examined her shoes , scowled at them , pushed back a lock of hair , and picked a piece of lint from her skirt . " I hate that woman , I just hate her , " s1w said furiously . " Iris ? " said Mrs. Pollifax , startled . " Why ? " Jcuny turned and glared at her . " She 's so bloody happy all the time , and everyone  --  oh , I should never never have come on this trip , " she cried , and burst into tears . A hotel worker , passing through the lobby to the dining hall , glanced curiously at jenny . Mrs. Pollifax said , " Come outside a moment until you feel better . " She led jenny through the glassMRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CMNA STATION 87doors to the front of the Yannan , where the bus had been unloaded and was just driving away , leaving the velvety darknessbisected only by splash patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own room by her purse standing on the windowsill . In the room next to hers she saw Peter walk over to the window and pull the curtains together . Except that if it was Peter there was something odd about his face , she noted absently . " What did you expect from your trip ? " she asked , handing jenny a handkerchief . " I thought  --  I wanted  --  it was supposed to  --  " She broke into a fresh spasm of tears . " And it  --  " She shoved the handkerchief back into Mrs. Pollifax 's hand , turned angrily and fled back into the lobby to disappear down the hall to her room . Following slowly , Mrs. Pollifax heard a door slam shut . Peter might be able to comfort her , she thought . Peter knew jenny best , and might be persuaded to talk to her . Since he 'd not gone to bed yet  --  she had , after all , seen him at his window only moments ago  --  she went to his door and knocked . When there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and listened . She heard no sounds of running water ; she heard no sounds at all . She called his name softly , so that he would know it was she , and when even this brought no answer she stood back and stared in exasperation at the door . He was simply not responding . Or he was n't there . The thought of Peter not being in his room sent a chill down her spine , which struck her as a completely irrational reaction . Moving to her own door she carried in the suitcase waiting outsideit , unlocked it and extracted toothbrush and pajamas . She thought , He 's just strolling around the grounds , not sleepy yet . But there had been something strange about his appearance when she 'd glimpsed him in the window , something off-key that troubled her . She tried to think what it was , concentrating hard on reconstructing that moment . She realized that he 'd done something to his eyes . The light behind him had thrown his face into shadow , but very definitely it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been subtly drawn upward , 88 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONgiving him a native look . It had been Peter 's shoulders and head that she 'd seen in the window but the face of a Chinese . So it 's begun , she thought . This is Xinjiang Autonomous Region , we 've reached Urumchi and it 's begun ... he 's gone out into the night to reconnoiter , to look for the labor camp . She wondered how far he would go and when he 'd be back . She wondered if he 'd be seen and  --  if he were stopped  --  whether his papers would pass examination , and she felt a clutch of fear for him . But it was going to be like this for the next few days , she reminded herself , culminating in his eventual death , and somehow she must remain calm . I 'd better begin doing my Yoga every morning , she thought . Resolutelyl9IN nIE MORNING Mr. Li knocked at her door at seven o'clock , itineraryin hand . He said , " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to change many plans , he was up very late . " He did n't laugh merrily this time but he was n't reproachful or accusing , either , and Mrs. Pollifax felt that she was meeting the real Mr. Li for the first time . " The plan , " he added , " is now as you wish . " " Come in , " she told him . " You can explain it to me and then I 'll make a copy and hang it in the hall for everyone to see , the way Miss Bai did in Xian . " " Excellent , " he said , businesslike and efficient , and walked over to her desk to spread out the papers . " As you see , we visit many places today in Urumchi  --  jade-cutting factory , carpet factory , museum , free market , department store , a hospital . Tomorrowmorning we leave for Turfan and stay overnight . After that the Kazakhs and the grasslands  --  with picnic and horsemanship  --  and the following day Heavenly Lake , very beautiful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh very good , " she told Mr. Li warmly . " Very good indeed , I 'm so grateful to you , Mr. Li . I 'll want to thank Mr. Kan , too . " " Yes , " said Mr. Li , looking down at the plans with satisfaction . When he had gone she looked at the crowded schedule and wondered how and where Peter was ever going to find the space90 MRS . POLLIFA% ON THE CHINA STATIONto make his own complicated plans and arrangements . She would have preferred to knock on his door at once to make sure that he was back in the Guesthouse , and to tell him that Turfan would come first , but instead she conscientiously found a Magic Marker and made a poster of Mr. Li 's schedule . Carrying it out to hang in the lobby , the first thing she saw was Peter , sound asleep in a chair . She felt so infinitely relieved at seeing him that she could have kissed him but she only tiptoed past and taped the sheet to the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer slanted . " Busy night ? " she asked with a smile . He grinned sleepily . " You do n't miss much . You guessed ? " She nodded . " Jenny was upset . I thought you could talk to her so I knocked on your door . " Pointing to the itinerary she said , " Turfan tomorrow , the grasslands later . " That woke him in a hurry . " Thank God , " he said fervently , and sprang out of his chair to look . " Now we 're really in business , " he told her , removing a memo pad from his pocket and beginning to copy it . " Look , I 've got to talk to you  --  " He stopped as Malcolm and then George strolled into the lobby , followed a moment later by Joe Forbes . The doors to the dining room opened ; Iris rushed in after them , upsetting a chair before she could sit down , and as Mrs. Pollifax began to attack roasted peanuts again with chopsticks jenny walked in , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her . Anotherday had begun . It was a crowded day . Although Peter remained upright and interested during the tours , Mrs. Pollifax was amused to notice how he dozed off during the tea-and-briefings . There were a number of these today because they preceded each inspection of it factory , and the scene was always the same : a bare utilitarian room with a photograph of Mao on the wall , a long table lined with tea cups in which lay dubious brittle twigs over which a young woman would pour boiling water from a thermos . Followingan interval of five or ten minutes the tea would sink to the bottom of the cup so that the brew could be sipped without acquiring a mouth full of twigs , and the foreman or cadre would begin his talk about the factory or the workshop , halting freMRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 91quently for Mr. Kan or Mr. Li to translate his words into English . When this had been done , questions were eagerly awaited . George usually wanted to know about machinery and methods , Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on paper looking for flaws , and then Iris would begin . Mrs. Pollifax found it hilarious to watch the change in Iris when her turn came : her face lost all of its liveliness and every vestige of humor , as if knowledge was a matter too sacred for lightness . She turned deeply serious , the Conscientious Student personified in her pursuit of how women lived , what they ate and earned ; her questions had a rooted intelligence behind them but they came out absurdly muddled . Malcolm , with a quizzical twist to his brows , murmured , " Do you suppose there 's a masters ' thesis involved here somewhere ? " Jenny 's lips thinned angrily while Peter simply dozed and missed it all . It was during the visit to the carpet factory that Mrs. Pollifax found Peter alone at last . George was determined to buy a rug in China and have it shipped home , and he was not a man to be cheated . While the others stood around listening and yawning and sprawled across piles of rugs , Mrs. Pollifax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside she found Peter restlessly pacing up and down the alley , pausing to run his eyes over a huge chalkboard on which words had been printed in pink and white chalk . " Mao 's thoughts for the day , " he said , turning to her . " Thanks for getting Turfan fixed up so quickly . I hear that originally it was to be last , so you 've really saved the day . " She waved this aside impatiently . " Where did you go last night ? " " Let 's sit on the steps , " he suggested . " I hiked . Walked and walked and walked . For one thing I found the Army barracks  --  bless Guo Musu for putting that on the map  --  and this gave me a bearing on where the labor camp has to be . " She stared at him , appalled . " But you must have walked miles ! " " Yes of course  --  walked , jogged , ran . All of it in total darkness , naturally , but there was only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ON THE CHINA STATIONaged to stay on it . It was a pretty close connection , though , I did n't get back here until six this morning . But I also found a river , and it just has to be the one that flows past and around X 's labor camp  --  I plan to follow it tonight and see . " She shivered . " If you find the camp will you try to make contact with X ? " " Good Lord no , just get the lay of the land , " he said flatly . " I wo n't try to reach X until I 've officially disappeared . " She glanced over their itinerary . " And when  --  when will theuh  --  disappearancehappen ? " The words had stuck in her throat , she could n't think why ; it seemed a simple enough question . " At the grasslands , directly after we 've visited Turfan . On Thursday . " " Thursday , " she repeated , nodding . And this was Monday .. . three more days . Until he officially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Why has it been so important that we go to Turfan first ? " He waited as a workman passed , wheeling a cart filled with bricks . " To hide things there . A cache , " he explained . " If you look at your map you 'll find Turfan 's a desert oasis four hours by car south of Urumehi , and on the same route that X and I will take as we head for the mountains . We can collect food and blankets there on our way , since I can scarcely disappear with a suitcase . " He sounded pleased ; she glanced into his face and found no hint of tension or fear . " That 's very clever , " she told him , adding dryly , " I forgive you here and now that forgotten drinking glass . " " Forgotten what ? " " Never mind ... Peter , does it have to be the mountains , is n't there any other way ? You must have brought identification papers that would take you anywhere . " " Forged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authentic forged ones , yes . Four of them , actually , to cover a variety  --  f people and intricacies of disguise and destinations .  --  She said earnestly , " Then why ca n't you and X leave the countryan easier way ? Those mountains , Peter  --  even if it is summerl " " What easier way ? " asked Peter . " Easier how ? Think a minMRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 93ute . We 're more than three thousand miles from Peking right now , and not much closer than that to Canton . To head for eitherwould mean train , bus , plane , hiking , and remember X and I wo n't be traveling as American tourists , we 'll be natives , subject to checkpoints and queries . No , there are too many variables , " he said with a shake of his head . " Too many bottlenecks , risks , and cliff-hangers , whereas the mountains are only six hundred miles away from where we are now . And besides , " he added mischievously , " we just might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kunluns . " " ' Mother-Queen of the Westl ' " He nodded . " There are surviving records of an adventurous emperor back in 600 H.c . who liked to go exploring . His name was Wa Tei and he went off traveling in the west with his retinue  --  alarge one , I gather  --  and he 's said to have penetrated as far as the Kunlun mountains that divide Tibet and Khotan . That 's where he met the Mother-Queen of the West  --  a kind of Queen of Sheba person  --  who ruled this strange top-of-the-world land . He was lavishly entertained and brought back stories that have turned into myths and legends , rather like Homer 's tales . Except , " he added , with a smile , " a good many of Homer 's stories were assumed to have been myths and turned out to be real . Who knows , it could happen to mel " " A Shangr-i-la , " breathed Mrs. Pollifax , her eyes shining . " How absolutely wonderfull " " Of course , " he added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dirt and lice  --  " " Do n't , " she begged . " I demand a Shangri-la . " " Mrs. Pollifax , you 're a romantic . " " I know , " she told him happily . " I am , I insist on it  --  but so are you , I think ? " " Guilty , " he acknowledged with a boyish grin . " But legends aside , it 's true that it may be more rugged skirting the Tarim Basin and the desert but we can travel by night on donkeys , avoid people almost entirely , and go at our own speed . And there is a British weather expedition somewhere in those mountainsif we can find it . " " As well as the ghost of the Mother-Queen of the West " She94 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONnodded . " Of course as soon as you mentioned that I knew there was n't a shred of hope that you 'd change your mind . A British weather expedition sounds rather persuasive , too . " " If it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can be found , " she agreed politely , and thought how unreal it was to be sitting here looking out on a dusty alley lined with sheds , tools , and carts and discussing with Peter a mere sixhundred-milestroll toward mountain ranges that peaked at 28,000 feet . I wish Cyrus were here , she thought suddenly , and wondered if he was back in Connecticut yet ; it was so very difficult to know , given those time changes crossing the Pacific ; her logic in this area had never been trustworthy , and speaking of logic she wondered why she felt like crying whenever she remembered that Peter was going to die in three days .. . Iris wandered out of the building looking distracted . " Oh dear , " she said , sitting down beside them and pushing back her hair . " Oh dear what ? " asked Mrs. Pollifax . " I do n't know . I hope the free market comes next , I like the sound of it , I must be feeling very confined . What is it , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said briskly , " Flirtation with capitalism . People in the communes are being allowed small parcels of land of their own now . Instead of selling their produce or pig to the government , they can sell it in the free market and keep the profit for them-selves . " Iris ' eyes opened wide . " But that is capitalism l " Peter grinned . " It would be tactful not to use that word , I think . Call it motivation instead . Actually they call it  --  " He abruptly stopped , looking stricken . I le had nearly used a Chinese word , and Mrs. Pollifax glanced quickly at Iris to see if she had noticed ; she found her staring into space without expression . A moment later the others came out of the building and they climbed into the minibus , and Peter gave Mrs. Pollifax a rueful apologetic smile . As he smiled at her Peter was thinking My God that was a close one , this is growing really difficult , I 've begun to think inMRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Iris . As he passed Mrs. Pollifax , already seated , she glanced up ; their eyes met and she winked at him . He grinned , at once feeling better . She 's really something , he thought , taking a window seat two rows behind her in the bus , and to his surprise he found himself wishing that she could go with him tonight , when he planned to follow the river to the labor camp . She 's getting to me , he realized . Me , the hard-line loner . He wondered what it was about her that drew him , and for want of any cleverer insight decided that it was a kind of capableinnocence , but that did n't fit either . There had begun to be a sense of kinship between them ; he felt at ease with her , which astonished him . At dinner Peter made a point of yawning a great deal , which proved tiring in itself for there were twelve courses through which to yawn . Because of their busy day there were no plans for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mattered very much to him tonight . jenny suggested a get-together in the small lounge for some singing , a suggestion aimed at him , be realized , but he only yawned and said he was going to catch up on his sleep . Once in his room he quickly changed into the cheap plastic sandals and gray cotton pants he 'd purchased in Man , added a white undershirt and then  --  leaning over his canvas dufflebag  --  he divested it of the thin mountain-climbing rope with which he 'd laced the bag . This he wound around his waist and chest before adding the khaki Mao jacket over the bulk to conceal it . Into pockets he thrust his jogging shoes and ID papers , and then brought out the very clever invention that tilted his eyes by ingeniouslyconcealed tapes . Peering into the mirror at the effect , he grinned : he looked very much like the workers he 'd seen all during the day . When he 'd undergone his wilderness survival class they 'd gone to great lengths to prevent him acquiring a tan ; now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very few dark Chinese . Both Mr. Li and Mr. Kan had complexions like bisque china , the skin very white and opaque . I 1 is own pallor , his heavy brows and slanted eyes certainly removed all re-96 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONsemblance to Peter Fox : he was Szu Chou now , as his papers proved . Unhinging the screen at his open window he pushed it back , slipped outside , and became part of the night . It was nearing midnight when he stumbled across the cave by accident . Only an hour earlier he had found the river , and in followingit had left the road behind him , wading across at the only point where the stream narrowed . This brought him into difficult terrain where he had to use a flashlight . He disliked showing a light , but it appeared to be deserted countryside . Since leaving Urumchi only one truck had passed down the road  --  he had taken shelter in a hollow  --  and rather than stumble into trees and over rocks , wasting time he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as untenanted . Half a mile after he 'd forded the river the sound of rushing water grew thunderous , the river curved abruptly , and he met with a waterfall . Deprived of any means of crossing the river again he trained his light on the fall , judged it to be about thirty feet high , and stoically began climbing up the hill beside it , clinging to the roots of trees and to rocks and bushes . Once on the top he admitted  --  not without resistance  --  that a brief rest might be a good investment , a catnap would be even better , and he set his wristwatch 's tiny alarm for thirty minutes . Finding a mossy patch among the rocks he sank down , leaned back , and promptly fell over . His assumptions had been wrong : the rock against which he thought he leaned did not exist ; there were rocks to the right and to the left of him but he 'd fallen into what appeared to be a cavity in the hillside . Turning on his flashlight he parted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light picked out a hollow roughly twelve feet by eight , its ceiling a little over five feet , laced tightly with roots from tho forest . In astonishment he stood up and trained his light on the ground above to see what had caused such a miracle . Roots , lie decided : years ago a massive tree must have been struck down , leaving a space over which the surrounding root systems had slowly woven a carpet as they groped toward the support of the rocks on either side . On top ofMRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CffiNA STATION 97this network Nature had gradually deposited soil and moss , leavingthe hollow untouched , and had then charmingly screened its entrance with underbrush . There was suddenly no need for sleep . Excited , Peter checked his compass , crawled inside the cave , and sat looking around him in amazement . It was dry and warm inside . Bringing out his map he spent a few minutes computing his location , marked it in penciland grinned : if his estimate was correct this cave was only a mile from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two peoplenext week while the security police searched for X. It was better than perfect , it existed only ten feet from a rushing stream of water , and water was the most precious commodity of all . Already in his mind he was making the commitment ; now he backed it by groping in his pocket for the dried apricots and apples he 'd brought with him for a snack tonight . These he deposited in the center of the cave , like a promise , and then he remembered the slab of chocolate from his previous nights ' explorations , and added this to the fruit . With a glance at his watch he parted the underbrush and left , exhilarated by his discovery . Continuing to follow the river upstream he arrived in a few minutes at a point where a second river joined with the first one to rush down toward the waterfall . From the pattern of it  --  the headwaters arranged like the crossbar of a T with the second stream dropping to waterfall and highway  --  he thought this had to be the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed this when he shone his flashlight across the rushing water for a minute and its beam picked out piles of neatly stacked logs and cut trees waiting to be denuded of their branches . He had reached a logging area . It was time now to find a way to cross the river and find the camp . Peter began to reconnoiter , as yet paying no attention to the water racing past him but examining the trees on each bank , his flashlight twinkling on-off , on-off , like a firefly . Presently he found what he was looking for : a stout tree on Lis side of the river opposite several strong trees on the farther bunk . Unwindingthe rope from his waist he knotted it around the base of thegS MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONtree next to him and knelt beside the river to study its currents . Vicious , he thought , nasty and vicious , exactly the sort of current that would sweep a man under before he had a chance to catch his breath . He sat down and removed his shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and papers under the tree . Then he tied the end of the rope around his waist and lowered himself into the water . At once the rapids swept him away , the icy water knocking him as breathless as if he 'd been given a blow to the solar plexus . The current tumbled him over and over , extracting what breath was left him while jagged rocks pummeled and bruised him . Only the rope saved him : considerably downstream it snapped him to a halt , threatening to cut him in half from the current bearing down on him , but it held and he was able to surface and breathe again . Now he began the fight to swim across the river , the rope holding him in place as he fought , struggled , dogpaddled , and at last fell across the opposite bank . But the icy cold had invigorated him , and a moment later he was on his feet , slapping his arms and jogging-in-place to restore circulation . With the rope still around his waist he hiked back to the stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet knots with ' chilled fingers he secured the end of the rope around the base of the larger tree . Checking it he found just enough slack ; the tree was well-rooted and the rope firmly engaged . When he finished it was still night but dawn was emergingalmost imperceptibly from the darkness , the shapes in the clearing where he stood acquiring sharper edges : dawn was only an hour away . He was bone-chillingly cold and he was tired , but his reconnoitering was nearing an end , he would soon be on his nm back to Urumchi with three days to complete his plans . He headed across the clearing for the shelter of standing trees where lie suddenly stood very still , listening . Tlie rush of the water behind him was deadening to the ear but above it or below it he understood that he was sensing movement ahead of him . Human sounds : the murmur of voices , the shuffling of feet . Lowering himself to the ground he crept to the next stand of trees and came to a stop . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intoMRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION ggwhich a dozen or more men were marching in a bedraggled fashion , dull shapes in a twilit world . Once in the clearing they stood passively , a few wandering off to lean against piles of wood , or to sit on logs while their leader  --  or guard  --  gestured to men unseen as yet . Peter saw the flare of a match ; from the vaguely discerned movements he deduced the men  --  prisonersweresmoking , eating , or idly talking ... a free moment before the day 's work began , a precious moment . One of the men left the others and strolled toward the cluster of trees behind which Peter hid . Quickly Peter dropped to the ground again as the man paused beside a low bush six feet away from him , fumbling at his trousers . He was so near to Peter that he could see the neatly mended patches in his drab shirt ; from the ground he could peer up and into the man 's face and see him clearly . And seeing him clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is Wang Shen ! He thought , I have n't even found the labor camp and here is XHe was shaken and incredulous . He did n't want it to be X , some part of his shocked head insisted that it could n't be X , searched wildly for discrepancies , demanding doubt , skepticism , second thoughts because this was not in his scenario ... And yet it was X , he had memorized that face until he knew its very essence  --  the slant of the cheekbones , the shape of the pointed jaw and the blunt nose , the intelligent eyes , the rather sardonic mouth . This was Wang Shen all right , and he was standing only six feet away from him . He thought , Dear God , this is incredible  --  the cave and now this . He thought , It ca n't ever happen this way again . Not like this . But he had no plans made yet , X was to be rescued later , after he had divested himself of the tour group , he could n't possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a mere reconnaissance .

POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONtempt now , it would make him late and then they would all be in the soup , including  --  and most of all  --  Wang Shen . " There 's the cave , " an inner voice reminded him . " The cave now ? " he protested . " Leave X there for two days when everything could go hideously wrong and I never get back to him ? Abandon him there with only a handful of dried fruit , a chocolate bar , and no ID papers should something happen and I never reach him again ? " He thought abruptly , I wish Mrs. Pollifax were here . The devoutness of that longing staggered him . He had believed he could manage everything himself and originally he had thought her preposterous , and now he wished above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What would she say ? " he asked himself , and then , desperately , " What would she do ? " Words suddenly came to him that she had used describing her meeting with Guo Musu . " Oh , I had no plans , " she 'd said to his amazement . " There comes a time when one has to trust oneself and whatever presents itself . It 's like that occasionally . " Like that occasionally . . . of course . He was nearly exhausted , he was trembling with cold and he had n't planned this at all , but he had found a cave and now he had found X. My God , he thought , Mrs. Pollifax is more flexible than I am , and I 'm twenty-two . And with the memory of her words a sense of her presence returned to him and he grinned : Mrs. Pollifax would simply get on with the job , matter-of-factly . And so  --  matter-of-factly  --  Peter proceeded to get on with the job : the softly called out Wang 's name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated now , startled . Some distance away his companions were huddled over a tiny fire , their faces turned aside . Peter moved slightly away from the tree , just enough to expose his presence , and then ( prickly popped back . But Wang had seen him ; his face had turned astonished and baffled . Peter extended one hand , thumb up . A moment later the man shuffled over to the tree and stood in front of it , curious but perplexed . " You 're Wong Shen , " Peter said from behind the tree . " Who  --  ? " " Also Wang Shen . " MRS . POLLIFAX ON 1HL MINA STATION 101 " Zhe shi shenme ? What is this ? Who are you ? Where did you come from ? " " Wo Jiang Peter  --  American , Meiguo ren  --  sent with papers to take you out of the country . Can you decide quickly ? Are you well enough ? To go now ?

" Peter said impatiently , " Because the Russians have learned who you are and they 'll be after you next . Lai bulai  --  are you coming or are n't you ? " There was silence . Peter waited in suspense for the man 's friends to call to him , or for Wang to call out to the group and betray him , and then abruptly , calmly , the man moved around the tree to peer at him and his glance was searching . He said , " You look very young , with good food in you . " " I hope I also look American  --  my eyelids are taped . " Studying Peter 's face the man 's gaze seemed to come from far away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very deep , and then his eyes sharpened , he returned to this cold misty dawn and to the moment . He said with infinite dryness , " If you have found me  --  if you have managed to cross that river  --  what have I to lose ? Let 's go ! " Thank God , thought Peter . Wang glanced back once at the clearing , bent over to look at a root , dropped to his knees and crept behind the tree , his movements without haste , measured , as if he had long ago learned the art of blending into backgroundsto avoid attention . Peter dropped to the ground with him and they crawled together to the next copse of trees ; reachingit they stood up and raced to the stream . " You can do this ? " Peter asked X , pointing to the rope which the dawn was illuminating now . Wang 's thin frame shivered in the cold . " Shi , " he said , and stepped forward . Testing the rope first  --  he seemed incredulous at its lightness  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONhand , at times almost submerged by the current , he propelled his body to the other side , climbed out , shook himself , and stood up . Quickly Peter untied the rope from the tree on his side  --  there must be no signs of their departure  --  and once again knotted it around his waist . This time he leaped far out into the water and was better able to control his entry into the rapids so that when the rope pulled him up short he was within a maneuverable distanceof the opposite shore . A moment later he was out , and joiningWang upstream . " We can talk later , " he said , pulling on socks , buckling on his sandals and stowing flashlight , shoes , and compass into his Mao jacket . " And the faster we go the warmer we 'll be , " he added , trying to still the chattering of his teeth , " although I 'll say right now that your escape was planned for next week , not today . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp glance but he said only , " Let 's go then . " They reached the cave within the hour , losing only a few minutes searching for it . Pulling aside the branches concealing it Peter said , " This was the first miracle , Wang , the second was coming practically face to face with you when I was only recon-noitering . " ' Wang crept into the cave , amazed . " Truly this is a miracle . " " You 're not so strong as you seemed at first , " Peter said . " You could n't run . " Wang 's smile was kind . " We 're given very little food . " Peter nodded . " And I 've little to offer you  --  look . " Wang only shook his head . " What you have here  --  just to see fruit and chocolate  --  looks a feast to me . I am also expert by now "  --  his tone was humorous  --  " in foraging in the woods . What exactly is the situation ? " Briefly Peter explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his own preservation , and he was worried and tried not to show it to Wang . It had taken him four hours to reach the cave , for instance , and it would take him at least anotherfour hours to return to Urumchi . . . Already it was past four in the morning and breakfast for the tour group was to be served at 8 A.M. , with a departure for Turfan at nine . He wouldMRS . POLLIFAX ON THE OVA STATION 103be too late for breakfast and even his return by nine was now problematic : how he was to explain his absence was beyond his capabilities at the moment . He concluded his story to Wang by saying , " And so you must rest and grow stronger here , for the mountains . When the tour group returns from Turfan late tomorrow I 'll bring you more food , but as you can see  --  " Wang had sat down on the cave 's floor and now he smiled for the first time . " Do n't worry please , I will enjoy extremely this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the word for hard physical labor . " It is enough to be free . Wo lei le  --  I 'm tired . " " Okay , but watch any tracks you leave in the woods when you go out , " Peter counseled . " Remember , they 'll be searching for you soon . When I return I 'll whistle like this . " He gave a soft bird call and repeated it twice . " Got it ? " Wang was looking happily around him . " Yes , yes , " he said absently . " Some apricots first , I think , and then I will sleep . I may even sleep for days ! " Peter said , " Good . Only wish I could . . . ziajian ! " " Ziajian , " responded Wang , but by this time Peter was already outside and beginning the long hike back to Urumchi , a trip made all the more conspicuous and hazardous by the growing light of day. 10BY SEVEN O'CLOCK THAT MORNING Mrs. Pollifax had already guessed that Peter was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling obscurely troubled about him  --  and when they as- sembled in the lobby at eight for breakfast and Peter still did n't appear her worry sharpened and she prepared for the worst . They were to leave for Turfan in an hour , their luggage had al- ready been . collected and Peter 's absence had become obvious and serious . The list of horrors that might have happened to him seemed endless to her : he could have been picked up by police as a local native for questioning ; he could have been picked up as an American with fake III papers ; he could have met with an accident and be lying alone and helpless somewhere ; he might have found the labor camp only to be discovered himself . What- ever had gone wrong he was not here , and he ought to be here . The door to the dining hall opened , they walked in to break- fast and Mrs. Pollifax  --  feeling embarked on a roller-coaster ride whose end she could n't foresee  --  sat down and without enthusi- asm attacked a hard-boiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have knocked and he does n't hear , the manager is to open his door with a key , he may be ill . " " Are you feeling okay ? " Malcolm asked Mrs. Pollifax from across the table . Jenny , seated next to her , turned and stared . MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 105 " Fine , " said Mrs. Pollifax and gave them each a forced bright smile . " Oh he 'll turn up , " said Iris cheerfully , earning a bland smile from Joe Forbes and an admiring one from George . Mr. Li stuck his head through the door to call to Mr. Kan , " He 's not in his room . He slept there but he 's not there . " " Slept there , " murmured Mrs. Pollifax : that meant bed turned down and sheets wrinkled . . . she was relieved to hear that Peter had thought of this , except of what use was a turned-down bed if Peter did n't reappear soon ? " But nobody has seen him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he did not laugh merrily ; he looked anxious and puzzled . " We do n't leave for Turfan without him , do we ? " asked Jenny . The two guides launched an intense discussion in their own language until Mr. Li shook his head . " We must . The arrangementshave been made . At nine we will notify security police , of course . " At nine o'clock when they filed out to the waiting bus , still speculating on Peter 's absence , they were met by a sleek gray limousine pulling up in front of the hotel , a " shanghai car " as they were called , bearing white curtains at the windows to concealits occupants . It looked very official and very menacing : They 've arrested Peter , thought Mrs. Pollifax with a sinking heart . A gentleman in a soft gray Mao uniform climbed out of the car , followed by a smiling Peter . " Hi , " Peter called out cheerfully . " Sorry I 'm late , everybody  --  went for an early morning jog and got lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks American ! " An early jog , thought Mrs. Pollifax , and her gaze moved to his outfit , the pants rolled to his knees , legs bared down to his runningshoes , Mao jacket tied around his waist , and a T-shirt emblazonedwith the words MOZART LIVES . Beautiful , she thought , paying tribute to Peter 's resourcefulness . Heaven only knew what he 'd had to discard to present such a picture , but if one overlooked the absence of his ubiquitous blue jeans , he was the perfect jogger , face flushed , eyes bright , and even in China they must have heard of the106 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONAmerican passion for jogging . She felt a leap of excitement , the very same feeling that overtook her at sight of one of her pelargoniumsbreaking through the earth : Peter , too , was blooming . He 'd carried it off . Somehow . The tension had snapped ; Mr. Sun was speaking benevolently to Mr. Li and Mr. Kan , who looked both pleased and honored , and Peter , giving Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wash his face . Several minutes later as he walked up the aisle of the bus he leaned over and whispered in Mrs. Pollifax 's ear . " You what ? " she gasped . He nodded , grinning his triumph . " The job 's done . Quite a night ! " " But how  --  what  --  " " Later , " he said . " Collect food , X will need it when we get back . Collect everything , " he added and looked up as Iris and George walked down the aisle . Glancing at his watch he said , " Now I 've got four hours to sleep  --  talk to you later . " He continued to the rear of the bus and promptly stretched out across four seats . Jenny , following , looked affronted and abruptly sat down next to Joe Forbes . X found .. , . X already freed , thought Mrs. Pollifax in astonishment . What could have happened , and how could it have happened ? What had taken place during this endless night ? The bus began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Pollifax 's thoughts moved with it : backward and then forward but no matter where they went they returned to the fact that Wang had been removed from the camp and hidden . How pleased Carstairs would be , she thought ; how pleased she felt for Peter . . . suddenly it had been done , and she was smiling as she glanced out of the window at the hulk of an old bus they were passing , and then rough adobe houses with pale blue wooden doors . " What does that sign say ? " she heard George call to Mr. Li , pointing . " It says , Protect our Motherland and Heighten Alertness ,  --  he called back . As if to illustrate its message Mrs. Pollifax glanced up at a distanthill  --  they were leaving Urumchi behind now  --  and saw antiMRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 107aircraft guns silhouetted against the sky , and posts strung with barbed wire . Against Russian invasion , she reflected , but it looks as if the Soviets wo n't find Wang now . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with clusters of commune huts in the distance . Off to their right the mountain range they followed had the shape and color of sand dunes , strange and surreal to the eye , and then the road straightened and was lined with poplar trees on either side , closing out the mountains . They began to meet trucks carrying laborers to the fields , but there was smaller traffic , too : handmade carts that hugged each side of the road and were put together out of wood with large old rubber tires for wheels , some pulled by one or two horses , some pulled by a man between the shafts . The poplars thinned and then vanished as they emerged into flat treeless country , and here Mrs. Pollifax became aware of the stone-lined irrigation trenches parallel to the road , with here and there women washing clothes in the water . But having purred with satisfaction for a contented interval , Mrs. Pollifax 's thoughts now approached certain new uncertainties , retreated from them , and then returned to face and examine them . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase two had been triumphantly accomplished , but there was no getting around the fact that the rescue of Wang was to have been phase three , not phase two . X was tucked away now but with a long and dangerous wait ahead of him , and obviously with nothing to eat or Peter would n't have mentioned collecting food ; and what if  --  perish the thought  --  Peter could never return to rescue him ? As soon as I see Peter alone , she decided , he must tell me where the cave is . Both of us should know . . . and in the meantime we must pray that he 's not discovered by the Sepos . Her eyes went back to the land , to a long flat lovely valley they were crossing , the mountains a marvelous pastel blue in the distance . Far away her gaze picked out a walled clay compound , dusty beige against the dusty beige of the earth . The mountains drew closer here to them , incredibly wrinkled like very old faces , and then  --  suddenly  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with nothing in sight but piles of slag , the sky , the road , and the distant mountains. lob MRS . POLLIFAX ON the CHINA STATIONSuch space , thought Mrs. Pollifax , such enormous tawny space . But why a factory here , and how does anything arrive or be taken away ? Her thoughts returned to Peter 's message in the bus . She could collect food for X , yes , lining her purse with that plastic bag she carried and slipping food into it at the table , but this meant that Peter would have to make still another trip out into the night when they returned to Urumchi . This meant no rest for him ; how long could he go without a decent night 's sleep , she wondered , and still think clearly for what lay ahead ? Across the aisle Jenny was growing restive . " Let 's wake him up , " she told Joe Forbes in a loud voice directed at Peter in the rear . " He 's slept long enough , do n't you think ? Hey Peter ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe Forbes , smiling . " But he went to bed early last night , right after dinner , " Jenny said , pouting , " and jogging ca n't take that much out of anyone ! " Mrs. Pollifax turned and said politely , " I 'm not sure that he went to his room to sleep last evening , he mentioned letters and cards to write . " Clearly Jenny did n't welcome this intrusion ; she looked startled , mumbled , " Oh well , " and subsided . It occurred to Mrs. Pollifax that It had been clever of Peter to use Jenny as cover during the early days of the tour , but his choice was showing signs of boomeranging . Jenny looked ready to cry again ; she was not going to take his defection graciously . A strange girl , she thought , and wondered what caused this penchant for overreacting . On either side of the road the country was flat and empty , with the consistency of gravel , but there were surprises : a suddenglimpse of rail tracks , of freight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then of workers strolling along the road wearing dust masks , and then  --  abruptly  --  a huge body of water in the middle of this arid dead land , fed by runoffs from the mountains and dropped like a shimmering blue jewel into the warm dry panorama . In midmorning they stopped beside a shallow irrigation stream and Mr. Li produced Lucky Kolas for them . After this they were off again through the Koko Valley to begin their deMRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 109scent into the Turfan depression , crossing an interminable valley of gray slag , the only signs of civilization the crisscrossing railroadand power lines . At times it gave the illusion of being a gray beach stretching toward a gray sunless sea in the distance . " Very prehistoric , " Malcolm said , leaving his seat to join her . " I hope by now you 're a trifle bored with your thoughts , as I am with mine . Feel like talking ? " She smiled . " Yes there 's a time for thinking and a time for talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added silently . He said easily , " I find I can all too easily succumb to group mentality ; it has a nice cozy hypnotic quality , rather sheeplike and very comfortable . " " Are you feeling refueled now , after being quiet ? " " Definitely . I do n't feel that you 're a group person , even if you do function well in one . George Westrum , for instance , is a group person totally , mainly because he lacks any original thoughts to entertain himself while alone . " Mrs. Pollifax gave him an amused look . " Rather hard on him , are n't you ? " Malcolm said simply , " He has been instructing Iris in the butchering of his steers and how they are sent to market , with side excursions into profit and loss . He sits behind me , I ca n't help overhearing . I doubt he 's noticed an inch of the country we 've been passing through . " " And where is Joe Forbes on your scale of ten ? " she inquired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to be . There 's that need to please , and to smile all the time , plus that lamentabledetermination to practice Chinese on the guides and to ingratiatehimself . I think in general he might be called an Ingra-tiator . " Mrs. Pollifax , finding his pithy comments almost as interesting as Cyrus ' might have been , asked , " And Iris ? " He brushed this query aside impatiently . " Iris is simply Iris . " " Meaning what ? " He smiled , his quizzical brows drawing together . " Why , an original , pure and simple . A transformer and a transcender. " 110 MRS . POLLIFAX ON ' rHE CHINA STATION " You like her then , " said Mrs. Pollifax . " Or appreciate her . Yet give every evidence of avoiding her . " He grinned . " I avoid George , to be blunt about it , and since he 's in constant attendance on Iris , well  --  there it is . " " And Jenny ? " Malcolm stopped smiling . " A rather troubled person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting her under enormous pressures . Nice little thing , a pity . I have the feeling  --  " " Psychically or intuitively ? " intervened Mrs. Pollifax humorously . " Pressure , " he said , ignoring this , " can go either way , it creates diamonds , it also creates explosions . What are your feelingson the matter ? " " At the moment  --  given her tears the other night  --  I think ex-plosions . " " Followed , one hopes , by clearing skies , " he said . " At the moment she seems extremely cross about Peter having a nap . Do I see green up ahead ? " he asked . " Yes , a rather dusty green but definitely green . Do you think we 're approaching Turfan ? " This seemed possible because Mr. Kan was unwinding his microphoneand presently standing up to explain Turfan to them : a city with a.population of 120,000 , containing seventy farms and where , for about thirty days of the year , the temperature lingeredat 113  --  F. , and in winter descended to twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of underground tunnels , some of them two thousand years old , through which the runoff from the distant mountains reached this desert city ... And this afternoon they would be introduced to this undergroundsystem . Whereupon he promptly sat down . " Short but to the point , " said Malcolm , " and since the air conditioning'sjust been turned on it 's doubtless 113  --  Fahrenheit right now . " " I see we 're back to red clay , " mused Mrs. Pollifax , looking out of the window . " My goodness , I just saw a field of cotton . " Soon she was seeing grapevines , too , and mysterious greenery growing behind the walls of compounds , but here there were wooden bars set into the clay windows , and large wooden gates in the walls that showed the Turkish influence Peter had menMRS . POLLIFAX ON IRE CHINA STATION 111tioned . On this road it was small tractors that pulled the wooden carts ; presently they passed a traffic jam of army trucks , and then a bazaar shaded by squares of canvas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And here we are , " announced Mr. Li as they swung down a broad dirt road and turned left into a large compound of whitewashed walls . " The Friendship Guesthouse . Lunch in one hour ! " A square hot room with cement floor and walls ; two narrow beds and a window ; a huge round fan whirring at top speed on the bureau ; a bathroom with a shower tap , a dripping faucet , and no tub or stall . . . Mrs. Pollifax went to her door and called after the others , " Anyone want to walk to that bazaar down the road before lunch ? " Iris poked her head out from the door of the room next to hers . " I take it your room 's as hot as mine ? Count me in ! " Jenny said defiantly , " Joe and I are going to sit in that grape arbor and check our cameras . " But Peter said , " I 'd love a walk ! " Once in the bazaar Mrs. Pollifax bought recklessly for X : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a string bag in which to carry them , and for herself a pair of cloth shoes and a kerchief . She was about to add some grapes to the collectionwhen she abruptly felt giddy and close to fainting . The heat , she decided , a strange kind of heat because the sun was only moderately bright . She looked at the man from whom she had bought raisins : he sat solidly under a strip of canvas wearing a white skullcap , his face shaded . Something in her eyes must have explained her dilemma because he jumped up , grasped her arm , and sat her down on his box in the shade of the canvas . She smiled gratefully . He offered her water but she shook her head , remembering that it would n't be boiled . Across the pathwayfrom her she saw Peter talking to a young native who appeared to be enthusiastically practicing his English ; George Westrum was taking a picture of the rows of nibber-tired carts that had been turned into selling stalls with the addition of canopies , boards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 1trench and was trying to approach a water buffalo that had wanderedinto the scene . Mrs. Pollifax 's sympathetic friend was still offering her water with a mounting insistence . Making no impressionupon her he pulled off his skullcap and pantomimed the pouring of water over it and into it . " Ah ! " she cried , understanding , and brought out the kerchief she 'd just purchased . He nodded eagerly and she held it out to him while he poured water over it ; she placed it on her head , delighted by its coolness , and thanked the man profusely with gestures . " That bad , huh , " said Peter , joining her . " Look , I want you to meet my friend over there , he speaks a little English and I 've got a deal going with him that includes you . In fact it seems to depend on you . " " On me ! " she exclaimed , and as the sun struck her again she recoiled . " Peter  --  " But he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here is my grandmother . " Mrs. Pollifax gave Peter a reproachful glance . " Not another grandmother , Peter ? " " Ah yes , " cried Sheng Ti , bowing and smiling , and she looked at him with interest . His face was at variance with his clothes , which were disreputable : neatly patched pants , a sweat-stained dirty undershirt , and sandals repaired with string ; his face , however , shone with intelligence , and his eyes were bright and eager . " Now that you see my grandmother you will do this for us ? " Peter asked him . " To win the bet  --  the wager ? " " Bet , yes . For the lady yes , I understand now , " he said , noddingvigorously . " Okay , then . Outside the Guesthouse . Wait down the street at the corner , okay ? Very secret . Ten o'clock tonight . " Peter counted out change and placed it in the young man 's palm . " Ten o'clock , Sheng Ti , " he added , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated Sheng Ti . As Peter led her away Mrs. Pollifax glanced back and said , " Peter , what on earth  --  what was all that about ? " " He would n't do it for me , " Peter told her , " so I tried him outMRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 113on you and it worked . An authority figure , that 's you , " he said , grinning . " I think he 's what 's called a hooligan '  --  no visible means of employment so I took a chance on him , he ought to be relatively safe . " " Safe for what ? Peter , you did n't speak Chinese to him ! " " God no , " he said . " I 'm just a crazy American tourist wanting to win a bet , a bet that I could drive a donkey cart for a couple of hours without the guides hearing about it . I had a hunch he might be open to something illicit . We 'll need to hide our foodstuffand sheepskins in the desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides , you 're not used to missing all the fun , are you ? " She laughed . " Disguises later , after we leave Sheng Ti behind tonight , " he went on . " A kerchief for you , that quilted jacket you bought in Urumchi  --  " " Very observant of you , " she said dryly. "  --  cotton slacks , and I 'll slant your eyes for you after we 've left Sheng Ti , in case we 're stopped . " He signaled to an ancient man with a seamed face sitting patiently over his cart and donkey . " Hop on , he 's a cab driver , Turfan style , and you 've got to get out of this sun . " She gratefully pulled herself onto the shelflike rear of the cart , smiled at the driver , and waved good-bye to Peter , thinking how confident and thoughtful he was becoming  --  and also quite dear , she added , startled by this realization . How unbelievable this would have seemed to her in Hong Kong and Carlton , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with this there came a strange feeling , not unfamiliar to her , that all of this had been intended to happen , and that her meeting with Peter held a significance that was not apparent to her yet . She was delivered to the entrance of the Guesthouse , gave the driver a handful of feng , and returned to face the heat of her room , passing Jenny and Forbes seated talking under the luxurious grape arbor . She felt only a little giddy as she examined her treasuresfrom the bazaar and put them away but when she left her room for lunch and sightseeing she wore a dripping wet towel wound around her head . She did not plan to nearly faint again114 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONunder Turfan 's sun , and if her day had just been extended by a cart ride into the country with Peter , it would at least be cooler by night . There were no keys to the rooms here , so that when Peter knocked softly on her door at ten that night he followed this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " We can leave by your window . " He was carrying his dufflebag and he placed it now on her bed . " What do you have ? " he asked . " A second padded quilted jacket from Xian , " she told him crisply . " In Urumchi I bought two sheepskin vests , one small blanket , and of course , there are the vitamins and dried foods I carried with me . And to fit all this into my suitcase , " she reminded him , " I had to leave almost everything behind in Urumchiexcept my pajamas . Even , " she added sternly , " my hair-brush . " " I 'll lend you mine , " he said dryly . " How are you carrying it all ? " " Rolled up in a bundle . " She pointed to it sitting on the floor beside the chair . " And may one ask what 's happened to your two lower front teeth ? " he asked with interest . " Ah , " she remarked happily , " that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bazaar this morning with missing teeth , and I thought it would add an authentic note to my disguise . " She knotted the plain cotton kerchief around her head , patted her cotton jacket and leaned over to adjust the buckles on her cloth shoes . " Shall we go ? " Peter unlatched the screen , removed it , helped her over the sill and followed , replacing the screen behind them . In single file they stole up the path in the darkness , passing the lighted rooms of the others and coming to a stop at a certain place in the wall where the top had crumbled , releasing the pointed shards of glass embedded in its cement to repel intruders . Tossing both dufflebag and bundle over the wall , they were soon outside the compound and moving toward the street 's corner . The cart was waiting with Sheng Ti beside it . A fuzzy moon dimly illuminated his features ; he gave them and their luggage aMRS . POLLIFAX ON ' iuJ CHINA STATION 115glance that unsettled Mrs. Pollifax by its thoughtful speculations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter smiled and shook his head . " No , we 'll be okay . Back in two hours . " " I did not steal it , " Sheng added , his eyes running curiously over Mrs. Pollifax 's cloth shoes , pants , and quilted jacket . " Good , " Peter said and tossed their baggage into the rear , handed Mrs. Pollifax up to the seat with a flourish and squeezed in beside her . Sheng Ti handed him the reins . " Zaijian , " he said , and stepped back into the shadow of the wall . The donkey moved , the cart lurched , the wheels gave one outragedgroan and they were underway ; when Mrs. Pollifax glanced back Sheng Ti had vanished . A lone cyclist pedaled toward them in the darkness and called out a greeting ; Peter returnedit , slipping easily and gratefully into Chinese . " But I think we stop now and make our eyes slant before we run into anyone else , " he said , and pulled up beside a vacant stretch of wall . " What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his flashlight once and very quickly , after inserting it under her hair . " The amazing thing is that it does n't hurt and it ca n't be seen  --  and now you are a true Han , " he told her , and she saw the flash of his smile in the faint moonlight . Slowly they proceeded down the road and out of Turfan , occasionallymeeting cyclists as they returned from work or pedaled to work , the pale moon etching black shadows of walls and trees across the darkness of the road . A dog barked . A voice was heard from behind a wall . Other than the clip-clop of the donkey 's hoofs and the movement of the wheels there was only the silence of the desert around them . " How absolutely beautiful to be free for a couple of hours ! " said Peter with a happy sigh . Since Mrs. Pollifax was already experiencing this same reaction  --  a sense of elation at being out and into the space around her and free of Mr. Li , Mr. Kan , and the tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It 's safe to speak English now ? " 116 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONHe gestured around them at the empty pale countryside . " Who 's to hear ? " And so they began to talk . Of families . Of what they had left behind to come to China . Of the desert . " The Taklamakan desert , " Peter told her , " has been called a hungry and ravenous monster . It 's considered far more treacherous than the Gobi , it 1 eats people and cities , swallowing them whole . " " Cities ? " she said incredulously . He nodded . " Entire cities that flourished in the days of the Silk Road . They find them now and then , the archaeologists , and there are probably more treasures buried there still than you or I could ever imagine , as well as the bones of men and animals caught in its violent dust and earth storms . " She shivered . " We 're not on the desert yet , are we ? " " No , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you and X  --  you wo n't cross it , will you ? " " No  --  skirt it . " As they talked , their voices low in keeping with the rhythm of the plodding donkey and the clouded moon binding them in its spell , she thought and spoke of Cyrus . " Why do n't you marry him ? " asked Peter bluntly . " If we get out of  --  if I get out of this in one piece , I intend to , " she announced with a firmness that startled her . " It seems to me now that I hesitated  --  oh , for all the wrong reasons . Foolish ones . " Someone said that if the heart is engaged  --  " " Yes , " she said , nodding . " And mine is . I hesitated , wanting to be sure , feeling  --  oh feeling that life would be different , changed , if I married , and that I might have to give up  --  all this . " " All this , " murmured Peter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool " " Yes  --  no  --  yes , of course I am , " she admitted , laughing . " But what I overlooked  --  " " Yes ? " he asked curiously . " What I overlooked , " she said simply , " is change . . . Meeting Carstairs and becoming useful to him changed me so that nothing was or ever could be the same again . " Like a kaleidoscope , she thought , remembering that simile following her first advenMRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 117tore . " But meeting Cyrus also changed me so that nothing will or can be the same ever again . Nothing . Not even this , " she added ruefully . " Which is what I did n't see clearly until now . " " You 're not sorry you came ? " he asked . She shook her head . " Oh no ! There were things I had to learn , as you can see . Important things . Even at my age ! " He said with a sigh , " I think my parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a misfit , a changeling , and restless . A very conventional middle-class family , except they did send me to Harvard where I did n't belong either but  --  " " But where you learned to speak Chinese . " " Yes . Funny , is n't it ? It came so easily to me , without any classes or lessons at all , as if I 'd spoken and read it before and it was already etched in my subconscious waiting to be rediscovered . You must know the very Eastern theory that we 've lived many lives ; can you believe in that at all ? " " Easily , " she said , nodding . " For a long time I 've found it a very supportive , meaningful explanation for the curious things that happen to people : the tragedies , the uncanny rescues , and coincidences in life . " She laughed suddenly . " And Cyrus has a rather mandarin look about him ; he 's a large man and very American , but there 's an oriental cast to his eyes that drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn to the country of China itself , " she added meditatively . " Think we 've known each other before ? " asked Peter , with a chuckle . She thought without saying it aloud : yes it 's possible , why else do I feel so connected with you  --  suddenly and inexplicably  --  and so alarmed about what lies ahead for you ? There 's an understandingbetween us , unspoken but familiar , that I 've experiencedonly with Tsanko and with Cyrus . Aloud she said quietly , " It 's quite possible , yes . A sense of fatefulness  --  of stars crossing  --  happens rather frequently to me these days . I lived a very prosaiclife , you see , and then suddenly I too met Carstairs , and I 've often wondered if this strange new life was waiting for me all the time during those years I lived so quietly .

" She looked around her at the low , hunchbacked surrealistic mountains off to their left . They had to be sandstone , she thought , to have been whipped into such frenzied , angry shapes by wind and rain , and to have created the gulleys and earth cleavages among which they were riding now . " It 's certainly a good place to hide things , but however will you find your cache again ?

" She stepped down from the cart , gave the donkey an absent pat on its flanks and moved off the road towardthree jagged rocks about six feet high . " I think here , " she called . Peter was already lifting out his dufflebag . She went back and retrieved her own bulky package and when she joined Peter she could see him nod in the dim light . " Good , " he said , and bringingout his knife he worked away at enlarging a hole under one of the rock formations . Into this he pressed the small items : vitamins , melons , two filled water pouches , the dried fruit , and the socks , finally sealing the gap with a stone . On the surface between two of the rocks he laid out the bulkier items  --  the two pairs of boots and the sweaters  --  and then covered them over with the sheepskins and at last the rug . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scatter over the rug until it looked a part of the earth . " Not bad , " commented Mrs. Pollifax . " But let 's not linger . Please . " He gave her a sharp glance , found several loose stones toMRS . POLLIFAX ON ' HIE CHINA STATION 119weigh down the rug and nodded . " Okay , let 's go . We 'll both pace off the distance to the road , okay ? " They each found it to be fifty-two feet . " You drive while I make notes , " he told her , handing her the reins . " Or at least what notes I can manage without a light . I do n't understand you , why not a light ? " " Not yet  --  later , but not here , " she told him , surprised by the depth of her unease . With some difficulty she turned the donkey around on the road and they began their return into town . She noticed that Peter worked over his notes like an artist , glancing up , holding out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing sketches into his notebook until at last he lighted a match inside cupped hands and checked his compass . " I hope you 're not implying that someone 's been watching us , " he said . To cover the strange flash of alarm that she 'd experienced she said lightly , " Let 's just say I 'd hate to see you and X reach that cache and find nothing . You 'll be coming to it from where ? " " Not from Turfan , " he said and pointed over his shoulder . " We 'll start out from the cave in the mountains and head southwest , bypassing Turfan , and after rescuing our sheepskins we 'll move south toward the Bagrach Kol , or Lake Bosten , " he explained . " Then we 'll roughly follow the oases towns along the desert , keeping at a distance from them , naturally . " " Yes , " she said , and was silent , feeling her dread for both him and X.They reentered Turfan , driving down the same broad road , the cart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When they reached the corner of the Guesthouse wall Sheng Ti appeared suddenly out of the shadows , advanced toward them , put a finger to his lips counseling silence , and spoke directly to Peter in a low voice . It needed a moment for Mrs. Pollifax to realize that Sheng Ti was speaking to Peter in Chinese . She said in alarm , " What is this ? Why does he speak to you in  --  " " He heard me greet that damn cyclist in Chinese , " Peter said grimly , and swore . " What is it , Sheng , what 's the matter ? " Sheng no longer troubled to speak English , he was obviously agitated , his voice breathless , his gestures quick. 120 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONPeter turned to look at Mrs. Pollifax . " How did you know ? " " Know what ? " " Sheng says we were followed on foot by someone from the Guesthouse . Very stealthily , very secretly . And seeing this he followedthat person , whoever it was , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11AT THE RAMIFICATIONS of what Sheng had said Mrs. Pollifax gasped , " One of the guides ? " Peter turned back to Sheng . " No  --  no , Sheng says not a native , he is sure of this . He says this person wore some kind of cloak , so it could have been a man , it could have been a woman  --  I asked him  --  but he is certain it was a foreigner , very definitely , because of the way this person walked and acted . " She drew in her breath sharply , remembering her searched suitcase and realizing that it had never been far from her mind . Something is wrong , she thought . Terribly wrong . She accepted Sheng 's judgment , acknowledging his shrewdnessand his street wisdom . " Where is this person now ? " she asked . " Back in the Guesthouse . " She turned her attention to Sheng Ti , realizing that he must be dealt with first of all . " What does he think or suspect about all this ? " she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this to anyone ? " Peter spoke to Sheng in Chinese . " He says he wishes to talk with us alone somewhere about why we carry baggage out of the city and return without it . He feels that he alone saw the baggagewe carried  --  which is probably reassuring if I ever find time to think about it . He also wishes to know why I concealed my122 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONspeaking Chinese so well , and why suddenly you have two teeth missing and dress like a Chinese woman " " Yes , " she said . " Where can we talk ? " But she was thinking , Someone in this tour group knows about Peter and me . Someone among them knows why we 're here . How could this have happened ? Who else would know about Wang ? Who else would even be interested in Wang ? " Not far , " Peter was saying . " You think we can trust Sheng ? " " For the moment I think we have no choice , " she said dryly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , " I believe we can trust him , yes , but in any case I have a brown belt in karate . " Peter laughed . " Would n't you know ! Okay  --  he says we leave the cart and walk . " She thought , There is no one  --  absolutely no one  --  who could know about Wang or be interested in him . Except the Russians , she remembered in horror . Carstairs had said , " One of our agents who works for the Soviets  --  a double-agent , needless to say  --  has brought us informationof X 's existence and of the Soviets ' interest in him . " Had brought them information of X 's existence .. . Information that came solely from the Russians , who badly wanted Wang for themselves . . . The same Russians who supposedlyhad plans to abduct Wang later in the summer .. . Supposedly .. . But what if instead , knowing themselves persona non grata in China , they chose to leak their information to the CIA and let the Americans find Wang for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the labor camp , find and release Wang and then . . . and then . . . Oh God , she thought in horror , could Peter and I be walking into a trap ? They were following Sheng through narrow alleys , turning left and then right ; he stopped now beside an abandoned irrigation ditch spanned by a crumbling bridge . Sheng led them under the bridge and gestured to them to sit down . Peter said in surprise , " He says he sleeps here , this is his home . " They squatted , knees touching . Sheng had been eating garlicMRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 123which made for a powerful atmosphere ; he was also anxious , and this too contributed an odor so that they hunched together in a cloud of garlic , sweat , and dusty earth . " But why is this his home ? " asked Mrs. Pollifax . " Why does n't he have a unit like everyone else ? " Peter began to speak to Sheng , and Sheng replied at length , and while they talked Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If all the information came from the Russians and they were being followed . . . She shivered a little , exploring the idea of herself and Peter being mere pawns because if her theory was correct and if the Russians were mastermindingthis operation , then it would be a member of the KGB who had been planted in the tour group . To watch them . To snatch Wang for the Soviets once he was free . And Carstairs does n't know , she thought , trembling at the prospects should her suspicions be right . Ile does n't even guess and there 's no way to communicate , to tell him that possibly ... maybe .. . Peter turned to her and said , " He tells me that he 's twenty-six years old and he 's hei jen  --  it translates as being one of the black persons , ' living without registration and without a ration card or employment . He lives off friends or steals and sells things in the black market . " " Good heavens , " she murmured with a glance at Sheng @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good identification papers to have dared to go out tonight dressed as natives . He wants either my ID papers or yours . Ile says he can pay . He wants to use them to escape to Hong Kong . " Mrs. Pollifax considered this with interest . " So he wo n't betray us then , " she said with some relief . " Not if he wants something from us . " The word betray struck her forcibly and she thought , Carstairs has in effect been betrayed by his double-agent , his counterspy , has n't he ? and does n't know this either . Aloud she said , " But how did he come to live under a bridge and be hei jen ? He looks very intelligent , I 'm curious . " She had to wait again for the reply , watching Peter 's gestures and the changes in expression on his face as he listened : sur-124 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONprise , thoughtfulness , a frown , a nod , until at last he resumed . " He says it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the mountains and down to the villages ' . . . the many young people sent down to the country to learn hard physicallabor . Sheng was cheng-fen bu hao  --  bad background , meaninghis family used to be rich peasants , landlords . Because of this he had no hope of school or a job in the city . He was sent to a commune in central China where the farmers hated these city youngsters foisted on them . . . this was ten years ago , when he was sixteen ; he felt lonely and ostracized . He stood it for three years and then he ran away . For this he was given shou-liu  --  detention  --  andthen he was sent to a commune near Urumchi where they work on the roads . Here he acquired more bad records  --  tan , or a dossier . What it amounts to  --  to sum up  --  is that he could n't conform . " " I 'm not sure I could have either , " commented Mrs. Pollifax thoughtfully . " But how on earth does he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He steals . People sometimes give him food . Once he stole a cartload of melons and set up a stall in the bazaar and sold them . With the profit he bought pumpkinseedsand nuts and sold them , and then jars of honey . . . " " Sounds a promising businessman , " said Mrs. Pollifax , giving him a smile . " He saved up money for a Flying Pigeon bicycle  --  one of the best  --  but being without a unit and without coupons he had to go to the black market to buy it . The man took his money but never produced the bicycle and since then he says his anger has given him much despair , he sleeps too much and has gone back to stealing . " Mrs. Pollifax said impulsively , " But there 's such sensitivity in his face , and look at those eyes . He should n't be an outcast . " Peter said , " I 've told him his country is changing now that Mao 's dead , and that mistakes of the past are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What does he say to that ? " " He asks how these changes can reach him . They are very slow , and even slower this far away from Peking . He says he has nobody to speak for him , nobody to say he is not bad , he says heMRS . POLLIFAX ON 1'Hr ; CHINA STATION 125is now an invisible person . " Peter shook his head . " We could never sell ID papers to someone like him , not with his background , he 's not reliable . " Mrs. Pollifax looked at Sheng , an idea occurring to her that she liked very much . He returned her glance , a sudden flash of anger illuminating those black eyes . " I do not beg , " he said , thrusting out his jaw . " If you should leave your country , " she asked him gently , " what would you do , what would you want ? " He scowled at her . " To go to school . To work . " She nodded and turned back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean well ' ? " he said indignantly . " As I just said , with a background like that he 's scarcely reliable , he 'd blow it . He 'd be picked up and he 'd blow the whole thing . " " Not if he left the country with you and Wang , " she told him . " If he what ? " She said slowly , " It 's true there would be three of you if he joined you , and three are harder to hide in the countryside , but he 's a master of hiding , is n't he ? " And if there is danger ahead , she added silently , three can fight better than two . Peter grinned . " Hearing you cracks me up , it really does . " She conveniently ignored this . " In the mountains you 'll need help with X , who may not have your stamina . Sheng could turn out to be valuable to you , and how can he blow it , ' as you say , if he 's with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be extremely reliableif it helps him to get out of the country . " Sheng was looking at her intently ; she could feel his tension as he comprehended what she was saying ; she could hear the quickening of his breathing , as if he waited with an incredulous hope . " You 'd trust him ? " Peter said . " Yes , " she said simply . Sheng sat very still ; it was as if he 'd not heard her but very slowly she saw his shoulders straighten , and when he lifted his head it was to say with dignity , as one equal to another , " Xicxie . Thank you . " And then to Peter , " You sell me papers ? I may go ? " Peter was silent and then he nodded . " Okay . But I give you126 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONpapers , not sell them , and you go with me . To the south and over the high mountains . " He translated this into Chinese . When Sheng understood what Peter was saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and touched his hand and saw the gleam of a smile : it was the first time she 'd seen him smile , and it was a smile of incredulous joy . He said fervently , " I will not fail you , I can die for this . " " It will be very hard going , " Peter reminded him . She said gently , " Peter  --  " " Yes ? " " He knows what hardship is . He can somehow make his way to Urumchi , ca n't he ? Give him papers and money and have him meet you somewhere near the hotel there . " " Yes , " Peter said dazedly . " You do n't think he 'll  --  ? " " It 's a good way to find out , is n't it ? " She stood up . " Peter , I want to go back now , I feel very uneasy about our being followed . I want to think  --  to see  --  to check  --  " He looked startled . " Oh  --  yes , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ought to be thinking about that , too . " Very tactfully she said , " I 'll think about it now , you can think about it later . " It had needed all of her will power to concentrate on Sheng Ti and his situation when instead she had wanted to cry out to Peter , If what I think is true then someone in our tour group is here to find Wang , too . They 've known who you are from the beginning and they 've searched suitcases until they identified me as your cover because they knew just what to look for and they found it in mine : that preposterous hoard of dried foods and vitamins . Peter , do n't you see what this means ? In silence Peter and Sheng escorted her back to the compound and around the wall to the corner where they had scaled it earlier ; she was boosted over it to creep stealthily to her window , where she removed the screen and climbed back into her room , securing the window behind her . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rechecking the thoughts that had dazed her during the last forty-five minutes , but her conclusionremained the same : someone in their tour group could be working for the Russians , and she and Peter could be in grave danger . MRS . POLLIFAX ON 1HE CIIINA STATION 127Hearing a faint sound beyond her door she tiptoed across the room and quietly opened it just in time to see a shadowy figure pause by the door next to hers , open it , enter and close it softly . But that was Iris ' room , she remembered , and she thought , " Iris ? " and then in astonishment , " Iris ? " By the luminous dial on her bedside clock it was half-past one in the morning but Mrs. Pollifax did not feel like sleeping . She sat in the darkness for a long time , not enjoying her thoughts or speculations at all. 12MRS . POLLIFAX AWOKE WITH A START to discover that both heatand daylight had arrived and that she had fallen asleep across her bed , still in the costume of the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Walking into the bathroom to wash her face she was confronted by a mirror over the washbasin that reflected a strange slant-eyed woman ; she hastily disengaged the tape hidden under her hair and watched Emily Pollifax emerge again . The sense of pending heat was oppressive ; she felt vaguely worried still , and jaded from those worries ; she had not slept well . She stood on the slatted shower platform while a thin stream of lukewarm water poured over her , and she wondered what Cyrus was doing now . At this exact moment . He seemed very far away . Having dressed in her thinnest and coolest clothes she walked out to the grape arbor to sit down and face her day . Putting her head back she gazed into the tightly laced green leaves above her and at the clusters of pale green seedless grapes grown in Turfan , Mr. Li had said , for fifteen hundred years . Presently a door in the long line of rooms opened and Malcolm emerged , glanced around , and strolled over to join her . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said dryly . " After breakfast , " she promised him . MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CIIINA STATION 129He nodded . " Breakfast in that incredibly hot little room with two fans , one of which does n't work , and George Westrum managesto find the only place where the working fan stirs any air . " " Courage , " she told him , " it 's only half-past seven . Except  --  where is everyone ? " Two doors opened simultaneously : George Westrum emerged from his and Iris from hers ; they smiled , greeted each other and walked together toward them . Jenny came next , followed by Joe Forbes , and then Peter hurried out looking surprisingly fresh and bright-eyed . They sat or sprawled under the grapes , their conversationdesultory and idle as they waited for Mr. Li . He joined them looking both serious and somewhat anxious , so that their greetings did not extract from him his usual beaming smile . " What 's up for today ? " asked Forbes . Mr. Li nodded . " We spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning we visit the Thousand-Buddha Caves , also an ancienttomb , and following lunch we look forward to Jiaohe  --  ancientcity  --  and then return to Urumchi . " He hesitated and then turned to look at Peter . " You were not in your room last night , Mr. Fox . " Mrs. Pollifax 's heart skipped a beat . Oh dear , she thought in dismay . " I beg your pardon , " Peter said coldly . " You were not in your room all night , " Mr. Li repeated firmly . " And how the hell would you know that ? " asked Peter , rallying , while the others listened in astonishment . " Because I looked in  --  there are no keys , as you know . I looked in and went back many times to look . You were not in your room all night . " Mrs. Pollifax thought , I 've got to stop this ; I 've got to think of something . . . " I do n't know what business it is of yours , " Peter told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China Travel Bureau , " he said formally . " I am responsible . You were not in your room , you were not anywhere in this compound . I have to ask , where did you go ? " They had all frozen into a tableau staring mesmerized at130 MRS . POLLIFAX ON IRE CHINA STATIONPeter , who stared back at Mr. Li ; they had been made uncomfortableby some unknown quality in Mr. Li 's voice , and by the rising suspense of a long silence that Iris broke at last by speaking . " Actually , " said Iris in a calm voice , " Peter spent the night with me . In my room . All night . " Every head swiveled toward Iris , and George Westrum gasped . Mrs. Pollifax looked quickly at Iris and then her glance moved to George who was staring incredulously at Iris , his mouth open ; she saw that his face had turned white , as if he 'd been struck . How strange this is , thought Mrs. Pollifax , all of us simply sitting here and watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's quite true , " she said with a lift of her jaw . " He was with me . George leaned forward , his eyes cold with anger and disgust . " You slut , " he said , biting the words through his teeth and he rose to his feet and stalked out of the arbor , his back rigid . His words seemed to reverberate , or was it the hate behind them , wondered Mrs. Pollifax  --  oh those tight thin lips , she thought , this had been there all the time . Even Mr. Li looked stricken . In an embarrassed voice he said to Peter , " If that is  --  I did n't  --  " Malcolm said pleasantly , " Surely it 's time for breakfast now , do n't you think ? " He stood and walked across the arbor to stand casually behind Iris ' chair , and Mrs. Pollifax loved him for this . Iris herself sat very still , a flush on either cheekbone , her head high . " Yes indeed , " said Joe Forbes , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet . Lis looked around , her face without expression , her glance resting lightly on Mrs. Pollifax , and then she too stood up . Jenny , staring at her , said , " Well of all the  --  ! " Mrs. Pollifax heard herself say firmly , " I think we 've had enough . " Jenny gave her a hostile glare and turned to Joe Forbes . " Poor George , " she said dramatically . MRS . POLLIFAX ON IRE CHINA STATION 131 " Poor Jenny , " he said lightly . It was the first evidence that he 'd given of being aware of the shifting alliances . They moved across the compound in procession , Malcolm walking silently beside Iris , Joe Forbes and Jenny with Mr. Li . Peter , falling in at the rear with Mrs. Pollifax , said in a low voice , " I 'm in shock . " " Accept , accept , " she murmured . " But  --  why did she do it ? " " I do n't know , " she told him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's becoming terribly important that we talk in private soon . I think there could be more shocks ahead . Where 's Sheng Ti now ? " " On his way by bus to Urumchi , I hope . I suppose you mean you 're worried about what Sheng told us  --  that we were followed last night into the desert ? " " Yes . " He said with a frown , " You realize we have only Sheng 's word for that , do n't you ? You and I have n't seen anyone , we have no proof . He could have made it up to hide the fact that he followedus himself . " " Possibly , " she conceded . " But in any case , " he added , his face lightening , " tomorrow 's the day for visiting the Kazakhs up in the grasslands , and at some point during the day I expect to vanish , which will take care of anybody 's lurking curiosity . " With this confident statementhe held the screen door open for her to enter the dining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot in front of the one working fan ; he did not join them at all for breakfast . Mrs. Pollifax , with dampened towel wrapped around her head , forced herself to concentrate on sight-seeing for the next hours . There was nothing else to do , she decided : she was experiencing a sense of events moving inexorably now toward their conclusion and without any way to alter or color them . That word inexorableagain , she thought with a shiver . X was hiding in his cave at the edge of the Tian Shan mountains , while Sheng Ti was somehowmaking his way to Urumchi , armed with his coveted Ill papers at last ; they too would head for Urumchi again toward132 MRS . POLLIFAX ON IRE CHINA STATIONthe end of this day , and Peter had reminded her that in only thirty or so more hours he planned to disappear . In the meantimethey had been mysteriously followed into the desert last night  --  she did not share Peter 's skepticism about Sheng 's tale  --  and Mr. Li had known Peter was gone . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Li of Peter 's absence , she could no longer believe that it was Iris . Iris had provided cover for Peter at a rather staggering cost . Sticks and stones may break my bones , she thought , reflecting on that cost to Iris . . . a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches . . . Why had Iris leaped to protect Peter ? What did she know , and how ? She discovered as they embarked on their sight-seeing that she was carefully avoiding Iris , going to great lengths to neither walk with her , speak to her , nor catch her eye , and then to her chagrin she noticed that Iris was going out of her way to avoid her , too . It was as if each of them knew something about the other they did n't care to acknowledge , but what had Iris been doing outside her room at one o'clock in the morning ? Since there was no answer available to her  --  because she was n't even sure just now of the question  --  Mrs. Pollifax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excursion into the desert to see the Thousand-Buddha Caves . This was not at all difficult : they had arrived at the heart of the Silk Road and it was an incredible countryside , totally emptied of colors to which the eyes were accustomed . It was a land of beige  --  beige , terra-cotta , cream , tan , and dusty gray , set into a valley of surrealisticshapes : harsh angles cut into sandstone cliffs , mesas pleated and wrinkled by wind and sun , and jagged tawny mountainsclimbing in tiers to a heat-seared washed-out sky . Nothing moved , nothing appeared to live except the shapes , which had a life of their own . Yet it felt neither unfriendly nor desolate . The sense of space was glorious , and the palette of earth colors were as warm as if they 'd been toasted by the nearly-suffocating sun . Leaving the bus for the caves Mrs. Pollifax looked down in astonishment on an oasis of bright green , long and narrow like a knife-slit between the jagged sandstone hills , a miraculous ribbon of greenMRS . POLLIFAX ON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down from the mountains . Standing on the cliff overlooking this oasis Mrs. Pollifaxwas transfixed . In her mind 's eye she saw a long line of camels , horses , donkeys slowly moving up this trackless valley to arrive at this oasis with its glacier-fed running water , so incongruous in the midst of the heat and sun and desert . In her imaginationshe could hear the tinkle of camel bells and voices calling to one another in the exotic languages of the Silk Road . If they were leaving China , they would be heading for Persia , India , Russian Turkestan , the camels laden with silk , furs , ceramics , jade , iron , lacquer , and bronze ; if entering China they would be bringing gold and precious stones , asbestos and glass , wool and linens , and  --  perhaps most significant of all  --  the religion of Buddhism . " Yes , " she whispered , " this is it , this is what I came to see , what I hoped to feel . " And she stood lost in the magic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spell . They lunched back at Turfan in the small hot room with its malfunctioning fans , with George again seizing the one promisingspot for air . Mrs. Pollifax 's returning cheerfulness was not altogethershared by the others , however ; subtly they had now formed themselves into two camps . Although there was not the slightest acknowledgment of it by gesture , glance , or word , Mrs. Pollifax and Malcolm had tacitly united to protect Iris , and Peter along with her . The others , thought Mrs. Pollifax dryly , were being far more obvious in their allegiances , and in the case of Jenny even strident . Jenny had come into her own : she now had George and Joe Forbes in attendance , and although her voice was shrill all of her elfin charm had returned . Like a Lady Bountifulshe offered everyone the raisins she 'd bought in the bazaar the day before , not even affronted when Mrs. Pollifax and Peter refused them . George 's baseball cap had taken on a more cocky angle , but his face remained a mask of tight-lipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to observe Jenny as if she were a precocious child , but Mrs. Pollifax thought that he was enjoying very much being in the center of things for a change . After lunch they were off again to see the ruins of the city of134 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONJiaohe , but they were growing accustomed now to the desert , to its tawny shades of cream and beige , to the far horizons and to the hints of Turkish influence as they passed through Turfan : the boots , the occasional sash around the waist , the kerchiefs worn around the head by the women , the higher slant of cheekbones , and rounder eyes . " The city of Jiaohe , " explained Mr. Kan , taking up the small hand microphone in the bus and looking very serious , " was once the location of the royal court of Che-shi . It is sixteen hundredyears old , having flourished in the year A.D. 200 . This was very important communication center on the ancient Silk Road . Of much strategy  --  and importance , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you mean by that ? " asked Jenny . " It is built on steep cliff with ravines all around . " " What happened to it ? " asked Malcolm . " It was destroyed by roving bands in fourteenth century . " " Roving bands ? " " Muslims . Genghis Than maybe . Nobody knows . It died . " He snapped his fingers and smiled . " More ruins , ' : sniffed George , looking very warm and flushed from the heat . " Looks like some sort of dried-out maze , " Joe Forbes said , as they swung past the solitary caretaker 's house and headed up the dusty road to the top of a broad mesa . " But a child 's maze , " said Iris eagerly , her head craned to look . " People lived where , Mr. Kan ? " " You will see , " he told her . " In small rooms  --  oh very dark , very small  --  inside walls . " The bus came to a stop , the doors opened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once strolled off with Mr. Kan , who talked earnestly to her , delighted by her questions and her interest , but Mrs. Pollifax wondered if Iris did n't attach herself to him to avoid the others . Peter lingered to ask directions of Mr. Li , and George and Jenny moved off together . It was Malcolm who caught up with Mrs. Pollifax as they approached the walls that opened into a vista of lanes and alleys . " Ilot , " she said , turning to smile at him . MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 135 " Very . Your towel dried out already ? " " I 've timed it , " she said . " It turns damp inside of ten minutes and dry in half an hour . Yes , it 's now dry . You 've been very thoughtful about Iris , by the way . " " Not at all , " said Malcolm calmly . " I have plans for Iris  --  I intend to marry her , except I do rather hope she wo n't go around being so quixotic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Malcolm , you 're wonderful , " she told him . " I 'm truly happy to have met you and I feel that I shall forever love your talking mice . You and Iris are a marvelously improbable combination , but now that I think of it terribly right . You would n't insist she stop falling over chairs or that she cut her hair ? " He smiled . " What , and lose that awkward flash of hands every few minutes ? Not on your life . " " When did you decide all this ? " she asked . " Well , there 's that psychic bit , " he explained . " I had a nearly overwhelming reaction to her when I first saw her , which  --  as you may remember  --  was as she popped out from under a table in Hong Kong . I felt as if I 'd been hit over the head , frankly . It took some time to understand what had happened , but there it was . . . . In any case I found her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed any help from the psyche , although it 's been very pleasant knowing all this time  --  really knowing  --  that she was n't going to marry George , no matter how ardent he proved to be . " " But what about Iris and Peter ? " she suggested mischievously . He laughed and steered her to the left , down a slope toward a more intricate arrangement of walls . " Surely you know that was a lot of hogwash . " " George did n't , " she reminded him . " Well , George is a nerd , of course . He has excellent taste in women , but obviously he goes after form rather than content or he 'd never have believed Iris for an instant . He has a small mind . " " Have you mentioned any of this to Iris ? " she inquired . " Good Lord no , " he said , looking appalled . " Not being psy-136 MRS .

" You 're being very tactful , then " " Oh no , just giving her time , " he said , and suddenly stopped . " What is it ? " asked Mrs. Pollifax , alarmed by the look on his face . He had become immobile , his head turned as if to listen to something she could n't hear . He said , " I heard  --  thought I heard  --  " She said sharply , " Malcolm , are you all right ? " " Yes , " he said . " Yes , yes  --  let 's keep walking . " " What did you hear ? " He shook his head .

" Mrs. Pollifax was already fumbling in her purse for the smellingsalts she carried with her . " No problem except that frankly you look awful . Here . " She held out the small vial to him .

" I 'm trying , I 'm trying , except that covering my ears does n't help , I can still hear them . " Ile reached for her smelling salts and unscrewed the cap . " This wo n't help either , " he said fiercely . " I still hear them .

" I wonder what , " she said , her gaze following his , believingMRS . POLLIFAX ON Int . CHINA STATION 137him , believing that what he heard was something lingering here from the past . " Not violence  --  that 's the strange thing , " he said . " Just weepingand wailing , lamentations , and a terrible sadness . " " Malcolm let 's get out of here , " she told him . " You do look horrid , you know . " Peter , following down the path and coming upon them said , " What is it , something wrong ? " " Malcolm . " Peter stared . " My God he looks absolutely wiped out . " They helped him to his feet and slowly retraced their route back to the bus .

" The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go and tell Mr. Kan that it 's bothering you . Sit and take deep breaths . " He hurried off to look for the guide , filled with an energy that defied the heat and promised well for his desert travels , thought Mrs. Pollifax as she turned back to Malcolm . " I always thought it must be quite fascinating to be psychic , " she told him . " An added dimension to life , you might say . Now I see that it has its hazards and its price . " He gave her a twisted smile . " Hell sometimes . Sorry about this , you wo n't mention it to anyone ? " " You notice I did n't , " she said dryly . " Good of you not to assume I 'd gone off my rocker . Hearing voices is one of the first signs , they tell me .

Iris , for instance ? Or the heat ? Or  --  " She suddenly wondered if he sensed or " saw " anything about her , or about Peter , and for just a moment felt endangered and uneasy . The moment passed . Mr. Li , hurrying toward them in the138 MRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATIONheat , called out , " I have sent Mr. Kan to find all our people , the young lady Jenny is very sick . " Mrs. Pollifax sighed . " And a four-hour trip back to Urumchi ahead of us ? As group leader , Mr. Li , I do think we must go . " Both Iris and Mr. Kan appeared from among the walls supporting a very white-faced Jenny between them . " Cramps , " Iris explained , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bus on the rear seat and a paper bag produced for her . Joe Forbes and George Westrum strolled in from a different corner of the city with Peter herding them like a shepherdrounding up a flock . The bus started , and Mrs. Pollifax took one last look at Jiaohe dreaming in the hot golden sun in its sadness . What did happen to you , she asked silently , and knew that she would always wonder . Once again as they entered Urumchi they passed the antiaircraftguns silhouetted on the hills outside the city , and thehuge sign PROTECT OUR MOTHERLAND , HEIGHTEN ALERTNESS . Threading their way through the sprawling town they passed several factories belching sinister yellow vapors , and then as they approached the wooded driveway leading to their hotel Mrs. Pollifax looked from her window and saw Sheng Ti . He was sitting by the road at the entrance , watching the oncomingbus with great interest . She saw his intelligent eyes focus on Peter , and then on her , and she quietly lifted one hand to him , and smiled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was here . The bus turned into the drive and Mrs. Pollifax , taking stock , found herself grateful , and almost happy . Sheng Ti had arrived to join Peter . They were back in Urumchi , and it was gratifying to realize that she no longer need wear a wet towel wrapped around her head and look like a berserk Arab . She was bearing leftover food from their meals in Turfan , all of it conscientiously , if wetly , stuffed into her suitcase , and behind her in the bus Jenny had fallen asleep at last after being actively ill a number of times . But most of all , she thought as she looked back on Turfan , she knew that she would not easily forget her trip into the desertMRS . POLLIFAX ON THE CHINA STATION 139with Peter . They both carried back with them the ramifications of that night  --  the knowledge that someone had been watching them  --  but for herself she knew that she would never forget that sense of leaving time behind them for a few hours , of moving effortlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barriersand touched them both so that perhaps the closeness she 'd shared with Peter was the most important part of the memory , and what had moved her most of all . And because of this she decided not to tell him of her suspicions , not to burden him with them yet . They drew up to the hotel , and it was Mr. Kan and Mr. Li who went to the back of the bus to look after Jenny . Mrs. Pollifax , leaving the bus with Peter , whispered to him , " You saw Sheng Ti on the street out there ? " " I sure did . " He nodded . " I 'm really pleased . He made it . " " Do you go off with food for X tonight ? " He nodded . She had to say it . " You 'll be terribly sure you 're not followed ? " " You can bet on it , " he told her grimly . " Good . What about your plans for the grasslands , for zero hour tomorrow ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turned and looked at her as they gained the lobby , and she saw that his eyes were distant and cold , as opaque as they had been when she first met him in Hong Kong . He said curtly , " I do n't think that you ought to know . " She did n't take this as a rebuff , she merely nodded , understanding the need in him now to withdraw and to build up that lonely austere strength that was familiar to her from her own experience . One could n't share , not in this business , not with other lives at stake , and perhaps , she reflected , it was this experience of altered selfness that was the meaning behind all of her own adventures : a sense of bringing to each moment every strength and resource hidden inside of herself as well as the discovery of new ones : a sense of life being so stripped to its essence that trivia and inconsequentials fell away . It was very akin to a mysticalexperience , as she had realized long ago . And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
