So complex is the language of the Omnibus Banking Bill that many of the Assembly ' s 150 members acknowledged that they did not know what was in the 72-page document . Even the chairman of the Assembly Banking Committee , Herman D. Farrell Jr. , a Manhattan Democrat , conceded that the measure had been rushed through the Legislature far too quickly for most lawmakers to understand what they were voting on. // For banking specialists , there is little question that the measure will push New York banks into a wide range of new activities by eroding the traditional barriers between banking and commerce - the sale of goods and services . <> <> Savings Bank Role Changing // Derrick D. Cephas , the state ' s deputy banking superintendent , said his agency intended to alter the traditional role of the 72 state-chartered savings banks through the omnibus bill . In the last two years , 18 savings banks have foresaken state regulation for less-restrictive Federal charters. // " To some extent , this does represent a departure from how we view savings banks from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that savings banks are going to be different entitites than they were. " // Many of the new powers accorded state banks go significantly beyond those of their national counterparts and come at a time when questions are being raised at the Federal level about the wisdom of widespread state deregulation of banking . The near-collapse of Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust in May has encouraged some banking experts to raise doubts about the headlong rush toward banking deregulation. // Paul A. Volcker , the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , addressed this issue earlier this month in testimony to a House Banking Committee . <> <> Warning From Volcker // " We can see a strong movement among states to enact banking laws more permissive than Federal law in an effort to attract institutions , to enhance state revenues and to create new state employment opportunities , with the obvious potential for undermining Federal and state policy , " he said. // New York officials argue that it is far better to retain banks under state charter because consumers ultimately benefit more from vigorous state regulation than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lure back those that have gone to Federal charter , New York has decided to extend sweeping new powers to state banks that in many cases dramatically exceed those enjoyed by national banking institutions. // A major reason the banks got what they were looking for in New York - new areas for investment that would yield substantially greater profit than currently permissible investments - can be laid to a simple but effective strategy that has created no alternative for the state . <> <> Bigger Role for Savings Banks // By first going to states like South Dakota and Delaware , states that had been without significant banking activity , and promising to create jobs if those states changed their laws , banks gained the first toehold in banking deregulation. // After winning changes in laws in those smaller states , the banks returned to New York and threatened to move more of their operations from the state unless New York substantially followed the precedent of these other states. // That is what happened this week . For the first time , savings banks will be allowed to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By contrast , Federal law permits only 10 percent of savings bank assets to be used for such loans . State savings banks will also be given unrestricted powers to invest in stocks and bonds - investments barred to Federally chartered banks. // Also for the first time , all state-chartered banks - commercial , savings and loan , and savings banks - will be allowed to invest in real-estate development and ownership , again an activity that is all but prohibited to Federally chartered institutions . <> <> Some Groups Express Concerns // State banks will also be permitted to engage directly in leasing activities and will not have to operate through separately organized subsidiaries as Federal banks are required to do , a power that will put at least some banks into commerce. // An array of community activists , neighborhood groups and small businesses view these new powers with some alarm . Ralph Nader , the Washington-based consumer advocate , labeled the omnibus bill " one-sided , special-interst legislation tailored to the agenda of the banking lobby. " // Housing activists and groups representing small business have expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make unrestricted out-of-state investments , will prove more lucrative than mortgages and small-business loans. // " It will have an adverse impact on investment in low- and moderate-income housing and on the condition of lower-income communities across the state , " said Peggy Kerry , a lobbyist for the Community Service Society of New York , an organization concerned with housina and social-welfare issues . <> <> ' A Serious Obstacle ' // " These provisions would allow banks greater freedom to invest their funds where they please rather than in the communities from which they derive their assets , " she added . " We see the omnibus bill as a serious obstacle to ensuring that even the currently inadequate supply of mortgage money will continue to be available for single and multifamily housing in New York . " Stung by the criticism of the measure , Governor Cuomo ' s office hastened to reassure lawmakers that although the powers the Legislature was giving banks were indeed broad , statutory safeguards sought by many groups were unnecessary . Rather , it was argued , effective regulation would protect consumers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate monitoring of the safety and soundness of the state ' s banks. // In a draft of a letter to be sent to Mr. Nader , Governor Cuomo outlined his administration ' s intent. // " This administration never intended to permit banks and thrift institutions to exercise the expanded real-estate and securities investment powers until after adequate regulatory powers are firmly in place , " Mr. Cuomo said . <> <> Lawmakers ' Worries // " Given the complexity of these issues , the speed with which the financial-services industry is undergoing change these days and the necessary specificity that must accompany any effort to regulate effectively in this area , the Banking Department concluded that the implementation of safeguards - which you and I agree are essential - should be left to regulation. " // Despite the Governor ' s assurances , many lawmakers feel that while the legislation they approved overwhelmingly may have been needed , they do not know what it will bring. // " We have to start making changes in the law , " Mr. Farrell told his colleagues before the vote Monday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise you it will work.
