The investigation into the case of Richard Poole that Dr. Harold Jacobziner , assistant com  --  missioner for Maternal and Child Health of the New York Health Department and chief of the de  --  partment 's Poison Control Center , had requested fell to a visiting nurse named Veronica Flynn . Miss Flynn received the assignment when she reported for duty at the Corona District Health Center on Thursday morning , May 5 , and she set about discharging it without excitement or delay . A chronicle of her findings , which she wrote and posted late that afternoon , reached Dr. Jacobziner the following day . It made sad but familiar reading . " I had 15 others almost exactly like it in my files , " Dr. Jacobziner said the other day . " All children , all accidents , all totally inexcus  --  able . Only the details were differ  --  ent . Fifteen cases may not sound like very many . It would n't be today , of course . But it was then . In May 1955 , my file on acetyl  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only went back a couple of months  --  to the middle of March , in fact . That was when we established our Poison Control Center , with Harry Raybin , an ex  --  tremely competent chemist , as its technical director . There was n't any file on aspirin or any other kind of poisoning until then . The accumulation of epidemiological data is merely one phase of our work at the center . The function of the center is primarily educational . That takes two forms . One is to provide doctors and hospitals in the city with a source of accurate emergency information when they come up against some unfamiliar kind of poison . There are hundreds of potentially toxic chemical sub  --  stances in daily household use . Every now and then , some child takes it into his head to sample one of them . In many instances , the doctor who gets the case has only the most general notion of what to do . He may know what it was that the child ate . That usually is n't much of a mystery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . But he does n't know what 's in it . Our people do . When we get a call for help , we have the answer ready , and also the antidote , if any . In re  --  turn for that service , however , we require something of the doctors and hospitals . They must notify us promptly of every case of chemical poisoning that comes to their at  --  tention . That 's essential to the other aspect of our educational function . It gives us a chance to study the particular how and why of such outbreaks , and , often enough , to do something to pre  --  vent their recurrence . Well , the Poole case gave us something to study , all right . Not because it was unusual in any of its particulars . In that respect , as I say , Miss Flynn 's report was only too familiar . It did n't tell us much of anything that we did n't already know about the causes of acetylsalicylic-acid poisoning . What made it a study was this : There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't present . It was prac  --  tically a model of carelessness , bad luck and ignorance . " Miss Flynn 's report was also something of a model . It could n't have been more explicit . She began with a note on the boy . He was still at Whitestone Memorial , and his condition , at the moment of writ  --  ing , was listed as serious . The report then took up the results of her investigation . She had paid a visit to the Poole home and talked to Mrs. Poole . The Pooles had a flat in a remodeled house  --  living room , kitchen , bathroom , bedroom . Rich  --  ard was their only child . Mrs. Poole , however , was pregnant . She was in her fifth month , often felt unwell and spent much of her time lying down . Mr. Poole was a sub  --  way guard and worked an early shift . He was not at home at the time of the accident . That was somewhere between 8:30 and 9:00 on Wednesday morning . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in bed and asleep . She did n't know when Richard had got up . He had had a slight cold for a couple of days , and she had sup  --  posed that he would sleep late , too . ' Hoped ' might be a better word . Assuming , that is , that she thought about it at all . At any rate , she was mistaken . He did n't sleep late . He was up by at least 8:30 . Up and about , running loose in the apartment , for all practical pur  --  poses alone . And only three years old . That was the setting . It makes a nice picture , does n't it ? Absolute // ly custom-built for trouble and ab  --  solutely standard . They all begin that way . " It was almost 9:00 when Mrs. Poole woke up . When she finally woke up , I should say . A little earlier , around 8:30 , she had opened her eyes for a minute and noticed that Richard 's bed was empty . Or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make much impression on her . She was too comfortable , too sleepy . The sec  --  ond time was different . She did n't just wake up  --  she was awakened . By a noise . It sounded like break  --  ing glass , and came from some  --  where in the flat . She rolled over and sat up , and this time there was n't any doubt about it . Richard was n't in his bed . She called to him , and he answered her at once and in his normal voice . He was playing in the living room . That re  --  lieved her mind , but it did n't ex  --  plain the crash . She got out of bed and went to investigate . Her first stop was the bathroom , and that was it . The medicine-cabinet door was open , there was an aspirin bot  --  tle on the floor , and the basin was a litter of broken glass and vitamin pills . She stared at the mess , and then walked into the living room and asked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He was hun  --  gry . He 'd been looking for candy . In the bathroom ? she said . They did n't keep candy in the bathroom . He knew that perfectly well . She told him he ought to be ashamed of himself . And so on , until he began to cry . She gave up in exaspera  --  tion , went back to the bathroom and cleaned it up . Then she put on some coffee and returned to the bedroom to dress . She was almost dressed when it suddenly dawned on her that the aspirin bottle had been empty . Not only empty but uncapped  --  and no tablets on the floor or in the basin or anywhere . But it should n't have been empty . They had only bought it on Sun  --  day  --  the day Richard caught his cold . She dug it out of the waste  --  basket and looked at it . It was a small bottle , but there should have been at least 30 tablets left in it . " Miss Flynn later saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to her during their talk . The facts  --  or , rather , some of them Continued on following page were on the label . It was , as ex  --  pected , baby aspirin . That means colored pink for eye appeal and flavored orange for palatability . One-and-a-half grains per tablet . There had been 40 tablets in all . But , of course , no warning . Noth  --  ing about potential toxicity . Only some mumbo jumbo in fine print advising adult supervision . Noth  --  ing to frighten the customer . Noth  --  ing that frightened Mrs. Poole , anyway . At least , not at first . I do n't mean that she was n't upset . All her reactions were normal . But mostly she was simply bewildered . It was quite obvious what had happened to the rest of the aspirin pills . She realized that at once . Richard had as good as told her . He 'd eaten them . What she could n't understand was why . It seemed fantas  --  tic , What had got into him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pills  --  a bottle of medi  --  cine ? It was n't fantastic , however . Not in the least . As she learned the minute she asked him . He did n't know it was medicine . He thought it was candy . Why ? Be  --  cause it tasted like can  --  dy . That was one reason . There was also another reason  --  just as good , or better . Mrs. Poole was like all the other moth  --  ers in our files . She had told him it was candy . She had told him so on Sunday and Monday and again on Tuesday , and probably many other times as well . It had seemed , she thought , the easiest way of getting him to take it . What Mrs. Poole did next was also pain  --  fully typical . She looked at Rich  --  ard , and he looked all right . Then she asked him how he felt . He said he felt fine . I suppose she was still uneasy , but that seemed to be that . So she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you ca n't . It would n't be fair . She did n't know that anything serious had happened . She had the universal attitude that aspirin is n't really a drug . It 's something else . Because drugs are something they sell only in drugstores , and you can get a dose of aspirin anywhere  --  at a lunchroom or a soda fountain or on a train . It 's just aspirin . " I 'm speaking for myself , of course . That 's only my interpreta  --  tion . Miss Flynn did n't interpret . She simply gave the facts . And one of the facts was that Mrs. Poole , understandably or not , was n't greatly alarmed . Aspirin poisoning does n't manifest itself in a minute . It takes a little time to catch hold . So when Richard went on playing in a perfectly normal manner , she was reassured . She calmed down . She finished dressing and helped him into his clothes , and they had breakfast . Richard did n't eat much , but there was nothing strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He never had much appetite with a cold . After breakfast , she got him settled with his toys in the living room and went to work . There were the dishes to wash and the beds to make and the rest of the household chores . That must have been about ten o'clock . Well , around 10:30 she stopped for a rest . Richard seemed still absorbed in his toys . She asked him how he was feeling . He did n't answer . Instead , he began to cry . She dropped down on the floor and put her arms around him , but he twisted away . That was n't like him . He was almost never cranky . She pulled him back and felt his forehead . It was cool but wet . He was streaming with perspiration . Even his clothes were damp . After a moment , he stopped crying , and began to whine and whimper . His stomach hurt , he said . So did his head . He hurt all over . Then , all of a sudden , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . The chances are she was too frightened to actually think . But she did what any mother would do . She picked him up and carried him in to his bed and tried to make him comfortable . Then she took his temperature . It was nor mal . As it always is , of course , in such cases . But it was reassuring to her , and by 11:00 she thought he seemed a lit tle better . The sweating had stopped and he was resting quietly . That usually happens at about that point . Sweat ing and irritability are early symptoms . They soon give way to just the reverse  --  dryness and lethargy . Now he was n't really resting . He was doped . In any event , he did n't seem better for long . Half an hour later , he vomited again . Then he started breathing very hard and fast  --  an other classic symptom . That , I gathered , was when the truth began to penetrate . Hyperventi lation can be a frightening sight , and it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor . She knew no doctor to call . The Pooles did n't have a doctor  --  not even an obstetrician . But I must say she kept her head . She did n't collapse or run screaming out to the neighbors . She wrapped the boy up in a blanket and took him straight to Whitestone Memorial . Also , apparently , she told them ex actly what had happened . Aspirin intoxication is an extremely dif ficult condition to diagnose . Unless there 's a clue in the history , you have to work it out by test and elimination , and even then it 's very often missed . Its actual incidence is probably many times greater than any of us realize . The treat Continued on page 114 114 president with your prayers .

I could assume that Miss Flynn had given Mrs. Poole some necessary instruction in the care of drugs and children . I marked it for filing and put it aside and went on to whatever came next . By the time I got back from lunch that day , 1 had practically forgotten the case . And then Miss Flynn called . Richard Poole was dead . He had died around noon . Respiratory failure . I wo n't pretend I was more than conventionally shocked . I was , however , very considerably star  --  tled  --  it did n't seem in line with the facts . My impression had been that they added up to a very good chance for recovery . Thirty tablets of the size he had taken made a total of 45 grains . Forty-five grains of aspirin is enough to cause a lot of trouble in a child of three . As a general thing , though , it is n't fatal .

Also , he swallowed it on an empty stomach . " Author 's Note : The physiology of aspirin is somewhat clearer now than it was in 1956 , when the above depiction was written . It is now believed , on the basis of the investigations of several researchers ( including , especially , John R. Vane at the Royal College of Sur  --  geons , in London , 1971 ) , that aspirin achieves its incongruous collection of efficacies  --  the reduction of fever , the reduction of inflammation , the easing of aches and pains  --  by inhibiting the body 's production of the hormonelike substances known as prostaglandins . Prostaglandin production is also linked to the natural formation of blood clots . It is the ability of aspirin to interfere with clotting that causes aspirin 's chief drawback  --  its tendency to cause internal bleeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an advan  --  tage , and aspirin is now widely used to protect against heart at tacks and strokes by blocking clot formation .
