Bishop Edward G. Carroll has a message for the 275,000 Bostonians who have signed the " covenant of justice , equity and harmony " - " you can make it work . " The covenant takes its strength from the people who accepted its goal of ensuring the racial peace of the city and opening up its neighborhoods and resources to all of its people , said Bishop Carroll , one of the architects of the covenant campaign . Despite any shortcomings in its leadership or its acceptance by Boston ' s institutions , " the people - who are all that the covenant ever was - can make it work , " he said . " What ' s at stake is really the survival of this city , " said Bishop Carroll , who has devoted both his time and his $5300 in retirement gifts to working for the covenant since his September retirement as resident bishop of the United Methodist Church in New England . In an interview at his office at the Boston University School of Theology last week , the 71-year-old churchman acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lack of real coordination , " from misunderstanding within the city ' s religious leadership and a lack of cooperation by its political and business institutions . But although some Bostonians have " the impression that nothing has happened " since the covenant was formally launched Nov. 19 , 1979 , Bishop Carroll said , the covenant has been " the beginning of people in the city getting to know one another . " Fifteen months ago , Bishop Carroll was part of the ad hoc committee that launched the covenant campaign in the wake of the shooting of a black Boston high school student , Darryl Williams , on a football field in the city ' s white Charlestown neighborhood . The bishop , who first came to Boston in 1972 when he was elected resident bishop of the United Methodist Church in New England , decided at his retirement last fall to remain in Boston . He has become a visiting professor at BU ' s School of Theology , but his first love is the covenant . One of his first actions was to claim the bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Trinity Episcopal Church in Copley Square since they were presented to Governor Edward J. King and Mayor Kevin H. White at a service there last February . " I wish it were possible to write every one of them to affirm what they did in signing and accepting the covenant and to get from them some ideas on what ought to be done , " Bishop Carroll said . " But I can make an accounting of what has been done until now . " He admitted that many covenant programs have been fragmentary and incomplete , but said " if we don ' t start some place to get to know one another , we are losing an incredible opportunity and risk a bloodbath - and this city is too beautiful for that . " " There is imminent in this city an occasion of bloodbath , a racial riot , if we don ' t start some place to get to know one another , " he said . He cited in particular these current or projected covenant activities : - HESED , a covenant-endorsed program involving 160 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high schools who volunteer their services to 40 human service agencies in the Boston area under adult supervision . - The beginning of an arts program to make the goals of the covenant more visible in the city ' s neighborhoods , including a series of block parties on the borders of neighborhoods , the sponsoring of interneighborhood visits , " progressive " dinners that take guests to several neighborhoods for the courses of a dinner , a series of art and writing contests on the covenant theme , and an artist-in-residence program at the Cathedral housing project in the South End . - Expansion of the current advertising campaign , which includes radio , television , subway and billboard advertising . - Plans for a cooperative housing development in the South End , jointly sponsored by the Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Cross and Concord Baptist Church . - Plans to encourage development of industry in Boston ' s neighborhoods through cooperation by downtown businesses , political leaders and neighborhood groups . - Pulpit exchange and joint services , such as those held recently between Our Lady of Victories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South End . - Sponsorship of joint meetings of public and Catholic high school principals to encourage the promotion of covenant goals among faculty and students . Some of these programs are incomplete , Bishop Carroll admitted . The social service project so far has involved only students at Catholic schools and not the city ' s public high schools , and the pulpit exchange program still has not gained momentum among the city ' s churches . But he noted there are important strengths to the existing programs . " All of us have said at different times , This is a Catholic city - if the cardinal would just do something , the problem would be solved , ' " Bishop Carroll said . " Well , HESED is a program where the Catholic schools have tried to achieve understanding among students of different races by working together on a service project . " The conversations between the Catholic and public school principals open the possibility the public schools will be involved . The arts programsucceeded in getting the organizers of First Night to make the covenant a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things that are necessary for us to survive as a city . " Covenant leaders have appealed - so far unsuccessfully - for financial support from foundations so permanent full-time staffing can be provided for covenant programs , Bishop Carroll said . " We have to have the fiscal undergirding , but we don ' t have to be dependent on foundations . The people who are all the covenant has ever been can make it work . " We are asking all the signers to join us in making a contribution , however small , to the Covenant Committee , " Bishop Carroll said . " The 275,000 of us can put teeth in our program through voluntary financial support . " The covenant is far more than an empty gesture . You , me , all the signers are the covenant . We depend upon God but , best of all , God is with us . " Contributions can be sent to the Boston Covenant Committee , in care of Rev.
