 | Expert systems ? Not exactly , but Formby 's Wood Care Centers do offer computerized access to expert advice on the care , repair , and refinishing of just about anything made of wood . These electronic display units , in home centers and hardware stores , have a key pad and a screen ? and software designed to make using the setup easy even for the biggest technophobe . Customers see a series of questions on the screen and answer them by pushing the appropriate button on the key pad . If you 're interested in staining wood , for example , you 'd be asked if the wood was hard or soft . ( Softwood requires sealing , hardwood does n't . ) The computer is prepared to answer some pretty esoteric questions : " The finish has worn thin on my violin . What should I do ? " And it can handle the basics : " How do I apply polyurethane ? " When the session is finished it prints out all the instructions and a shopping list of supplies needed to complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it home . So who 's the expert supplying the advice ? Company founder Homer Formby ( a third-generation craftsman ) , naturally . Plastic concrete Portland cement is the most widely used construction material . Mixed with aggregate to form concrete , it is economical , versatile , and very strong in compression . " But it is brittle , tends to crack , and often fails when subjected to high flexing loads , " notes Norm Cadsawan , a research specialist at Master Builders Inc. , a Cleveland company that specializes in chemical additives used to customize and improve the performance of concrete . Now Master Builders and GE Plastics have teamed up on a research project aimed at improving concrete by stirring some of GE 's high-tech engineering plastics into the brew . The first use of the resulting concrete composite will be as counter tops , sidewalks , and sections of the basement floor in the plastic demonstration house GE is building near its headquarters in Pittsfield , Mass . Cover story , Aug. ' 88 . Many plastics fare badly in the highly alkaline environment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concrete 's performance , according to Master Builders . But by adding the right engineering plastics , researchers aim to produce a lightweight concrete composite material with more impact strength , abrasion resistance , thermal resistance , and design flexibility than ordinary concrete . The two companies expect to develop a whole range of products based on the properties of different engineering plastics . But the most welcome aspect of the project may be environmental : Recycled plastics are to play a key role in the technology . Saving energy with lights An innovative program started by a Massachusetts utility , Municipal Lighting Plant of Taunton , and a major lighting company , Philips , has combined technology and marketing savvy to conserve electricity through the use of energy-saving lighting . The program , called Smartlight , began last year and continues to draw interest from utilities nationwide . First , the technology . Fluorescent fixtures are much more energy-efficient than incandescents : The Philips SL-18 , for example , uses only 18 watts to produce the same amount of light as a 75-watt incandescent light bulb ? that 's about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 10 times longer than incandescents . However , compact fluorescent lights ? those that fit a standard incandescent socket ? are controlled by electronic ballasts and use bulbs folded into U or S shapes to take up less room than conventional fluorescents . They are therefore expensive , and many potential consumers shy away from them . Here 's where the marketing comes in . The compact fluorescents , which cos : from $15 to $20 each , are leased from the utility by the customer for 20 cents per month . The program guarantees customers a saving of more than $50 in electricity costs over the life of each lamp , which if burned six hours a day will last approximately five years ? T. O. B. What 's a dog to do ? First Fido lost the milkman ; now he may lose the meter man too . A few gas , electric , and water utilities are pulling the meter readers off their beats and switching to automated meter reading ( AMR ) , either radio- or telephone-based systems . If the tests prove successful ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gas Co. is one utility that recently began a company-wide conver-@# @#  | sion to a radio-based system . Ninetytwo percent of the gas meters in that utility 's service area are indoors , and with fewer mothers staying home these days , it 's increasingly difficult for the reader to get to the meter . That 's one reason utilities send estimated bills , which neither company nor homeowners like . To convert to AMR , Boston Gas installed small battery-powered **28;1193;TOOLONG ( ERTs ) ? about the size of a deck of playing cards ? on each customer 's gas meters . The device reads and stores data on gas consumption ( similar systems read electric and water meters ) . Then it radios messages to a company van cruising by . The van is outfitted with radio equipment and a computer with proprietary software . " As it goes down the street ? at five miles an hour or fifty miles an hour ? it sends out an interrogation signal to wake up the ERTs , " explains Bettie Gibson of Minnegasco , the Minnesota gas utility that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . " The house address and all the data from the meter are displayed on a CRT in the van ( see photo above left ) and recorded on a disc . " After the route is finished , the driver just pulls the disc out of the computer , and it goes into the central computer in the office for billing , " says Gibson . " So it eliminates a lot of steps . " Though meter access is one problem automated systems solve , the big impetus for change is efficiency : A van driving down the street at normal speeds can read up to 24,000 meters in an eight-hour shift . An average meter reader can hit 200 to 250 in a work day . AMR systems also claim impressive accuracy . After Boston Gas had converted 1,000 meters , it tested them against human meter readers . " Wherever we found readings that did n't agree , we went back and verified them , " says James W. Hunter , vice president of customer activities . " And in every case the AMR had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology to do it was developed by Minnegasco 's sister companies , EnScan Inc. and E.F . Johnson Co . Minnegasco ( which serves Minnesota , Nebraska , and South Dakota ) ex- pects to have all its own customers converted to AMR by 1992 . Con Edison , New York 's electric and gas utility , bought a testing package , as did the city of New York for water meters , Gibson reports . " In all , about thirteen companies are doing evaluations or full-scale installations , " she notes . " And British Gas in London , the largest in the world , just bought an evaluation package . " Converting each meter costs the utility about $60 . Low conversion cost is the prime advantage radio-based systems claim over telephone-based systems , which cost a utility about $100 per meter . But telephone systems offer possibilities beyond remote meter reading . They can collect time-of-use data , for example , or detect and report a pressure drop in a gas line . With the telephone-based system , the utility 's AMR computer " calls " your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 seconds ( generally between midnight and 5 a.m. ) reads the meter . It costs you nothing , and if the phone is busy , it calls back . ( I think I 'll put a new message on my answering machine : Bow-wow ! ) High-fiber connectors Rust-colored stains mar the sides of some concrete houses and foundations like tears of iron ? the legacy of corroded steel rods that hold rigid foaminsulation board to poured concrete . The steel pins also conduct heat , thereby lowering insulation efficiency .  | Now there 's an alternative : Unique fiber-composite rods that replace the usual steel connectors , thus eliminating rust stains and improving insulation values . Called Thermomass Foam Sandwich Foundation System , the fiber-composite connectors were developed and are manufactured by Composite Technologies Corp . The system was developed for foundations , but can also be used 11 for walls . The pins are half the weight and have twice the strength of comparable steel rods . And because they do not conduct heat readily , the R-value of a sandwich wall may be increased by more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The R-value of a sandwich wall using the Thermomass rods with two inches of Styrofoam is 11 ; using steel connectors , it 's 5.5 . " Our fiber-composite connectors are a direct replacement for steel connectors , " says Kim Ulvestad , a manager at the Ames , Iowa , company . The connector , made from resin-impregnated fiberglass , is pultruded and cut into different lengths . " It 's like pulling taffy , " Ulvestad explains . " Inside the pultrusion cavity , the hardened rod is pulled on either side by two large hydraulic cylinders . Then it 's cut with watercooled diamond saw wheels . " After it 's cut , a double-flanged polystyrene collar is injection-molded around its center . One collar flange is fixed ; the other is movable . Thus one fitting can accommodate insulation from one to nine inches thick . " Insulation values then vary from R-11 to R-40 when Styrofoam insulation is used , " says Long . Installing the Thermomass system is a three-step process : Insert the connectors into pre-drilled foam panels , place the foam panels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's no inserting of extra metal anchors or hardware ? a lot of extra steps have been eliminated , " says Ulvestad . Thermomass connectors can be used with bead board , expanded polystyrene and rigid polyurethane . But only Styrofoam insulation ( with which it is being marketed in an agreement with Dow Chemical Co. ) is pre-drilled to accept the connectors .

Efficient heater The Mendota Gas Insert is a decorative liquid-propane or natural-gasburning fireplace insert with a difference : It is designed to put more heat @# @#  | into your room ? not up the flue ? without the problems of wood combustion . " A typical masonry or zero-clearance fireplace provides some radiant heat , but it pulls substantially more heat out of your house , " says Greg Iverson , national marketing manager of Mendota Forge . " The Mendota provides nearly twice the heating of most other inserts because it is designed to be a room heater , " he says . The insert has a convective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flue , and then return the air to the house . So while the fireplace burns at 75-percent efficiency ( a good , but not unusually high , number ) , it has a 30,000-Btu-per-hour output , the company claims . Because the LP or natural gas burns more cleanly than wood , there 's no creosote buildup , sparks , or emissions problem , as with wood-burning fireplaces and stoves Dec. ' 84 , Dec. ' 87 . The insert can fit into an existing fireplace and comes with glass doors . It uses the existing chimney for venting ( some installations may require a flue liner ) . An added feature : " It has a millivolt system , " says Iverson . " The heat generated by the pilot light with a thermal pile can create enough low-voltage electricity to make the insert run in a power failure ? so it 's a good backup heat source . " How does that work ? The thermal pile is a small copper cylinder that houses a series of copper and iron wires that are twisted together . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two metals produce enough voltage to operate the gas valve . Controlling the mixture of air and combustion byproducts makes the insert 's fire a realistic gold , rather than blue . The ceramic logs also were made to look genuine . " We took real logs and made molds until we got the right look , " explains Iverson . Cost : $1,450 to $1,650 , depending on accessories such as remote control and thermostat .
