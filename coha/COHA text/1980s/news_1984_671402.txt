No young Russians sit glued to video screens chasing invaders from outer space , and none of their older brothers are busy at their personal computers finding ways to break into private mainframes. // The situation is one that may give comfort to the guardians of secrecy in the Kremlin . But it is one that is alarming members of the scientific and academic elite , who are saying that unless something is done to raise computer consciousness in the Soviet Union , the East-West gap in electronic technology will become unbridgeable. // Anatoly P. Aleksandrov , president of the Academy of Sciences , said last January in Izvestia that training in computers had to become a national priority. // " We must build a program somewhat like the one we developed to eliminate illiteracy after the October Revolution , a program that is probably no less important in today ' s world , " he said. // Action has been slow and cautious . Part of the reason is that popularizing the computer would make it difficult to continue tight controls on information. // So far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Moscow and in Novosibirsk , with 20 personal computers each . Officials say 150 schools are expected to have programs by 1986. // The focus of the training is a table- top model named Agat , for which the Apple II served as a prototype . Some Soviet wags have suggested that the Agat could more properly be called " yabloko , " Russian for apple. // Production of the Agat computers has been slow . Yevgeny P. Velikhov , a vice president of the Academy of Sciences who heads the Department of Information Science , Computer Technology and Automation , said in a recent issue of the academy ' s journal Vestnik that production was is still of the order of " tens a year " and that quality was a problem. // The designer of the computer , A. F. Ioffe of the Ministry of the Radio Industry , wrote recently : // " Mass production of this machine demands a solution to the problem of reliability of all its components . And this requires huge expenditures and even a certain change in the psychology of the workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> <> Allusion to Poor Quality // The allusion was to an aspect of economic planning that still stresses the overall fulfillment of " gross production " plans expressed in rubles , instead of meeting the demand for a specific range of high-quality goods. // Though large computers have long become a fixture in Government agencies , large industrial plants and in the military , the debate over the spread of personal computers has revealed an anxiety that unless Soviet society can be made " computer friendly , " computers will remain an exotic tool. // Dr. Aleksandrov wrote , " We are not making sufficiently effective use of even the comparatively few computers being manufactured for industry and for design and research agencies. " // The problem , he said , is a lack of trained personnel and the fact that managers are " not sufficiently aware of the potential of computers . " His urgency seemed to stem from what the embargo imposed by the United States on the export of electronic technology to the Soviet Union . <> <> Soviet Hoped for Imports // In the 1970 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West through imports of high technology . But the embargo imposed by President Carter after Soviet forces joined the fighting in Afghanistan drove home to the Russians that they would have to develop their own electronic expertise . The result has been a concerted effort within the Soviet bloc to develop its own computer industry , and an effort by Soviet agents to tap Western technology by whatever means possible. // The longer-term solution is to get computers into schools. // " The coming of computers to the schools is inevitable , " Andrei P. Yershov , a computer expert in the Siberian Division of the Academy of Sciences , wrote . " It is an indispensable factor in the spread of information . Schools must assimilate the computer as a subject and as a tool of study . Programming must become a second literacy. " // But while Soviet scientists cite slow production , shoddy computers , lack of consumer interest and similar factors , Western experts believe a far greater obstacle stands in the way - the inherent wariness of the state about any technology whose grist is information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graham of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , who is a specialist in Soviet science policy , wrote recently that the access to data inherent in computer use runs counter to basic principles of Soviet control. // " The Soviet Union has a tradition of barring individual control over communications , " he wrote . " It controls information zealously and is the most secretive industrialized power. " // If the movie " Wargames " frightened Americans with the notion of a young " hacker " plugging into a military computer and nearly touching off a nuclear exchange , the very notion of anyone rummaging through a government data bank is inimical to Soviet thinking. // This is a system where not only statistics for most metals , but the provincial output of such seemingly innocuous goods as cotton fabrics is now secret , not to speak of infant mortality , grain production or crime rates. // Then there is the specter of dissidents armed with high-speed printers , churning out copies of " Gulag Archipelago " from floppy disks smuggled in by foreign tourists . At Soviet offices , common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away at night . <> <> Personal Use Seems Ruled Out // Such considerations effectively rule out the possibility that private citizens will be able to buy personal computers anytime soon , and officials usually talk about supplying them to schools , offices and research facilities. // The problem the Soviet Union thus faces is how to join in the information revolution without giving away information . The traditional approach has been to give access on a need-to-know basis . Academic researchers working on the United States , for example , are allowed to consult the closely guarded files of American periodicals. // But the proponents of computerization say that computer literacy must be spread broadly if the Soviet Union is to learn how to apply the new technology. // " One of the most important tasks before us is to develop an interest in personal computers among consumers , " Dr. Velikhov of the Academy of Sciences wrote . " So far only tens are being produced per year , and there has been little interest beyond a small group of biologists , chemists and other specialists. // " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any need for personal computers , which is essential , and producers do not produce them . " <> <> Mass Production Is No Answer // Dr. Velikhov did not see the solution in saturating the land with personal computers . Planners must not forget what happened to electronic calculators , he said. // Calculators have been gathering dust on store shelves for much the same reason digital watches do : They are subject to breakdowns , no one knows how to fix them , and batteries are rarely available. //
