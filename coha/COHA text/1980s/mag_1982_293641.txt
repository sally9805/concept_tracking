For most Americans , the Federal Reserve System , a mysterious world of money supply and discount rates , and the policies of its chairman , Paul Volcker , seem somewhat removed from everyday life . As TIME 'S cover story this week makes clear , however , " Volckernomics , " the Federal Reserve 's anti-inflation policy , has resulted in unpredictable interest rates that affect everyone . Explaining the intricacies of monetary policy has been part of the job of Washington Correspondent David Beckwith , who helps report national economics for TIME . Says Beckwith : " Economics , Reaganomics and Volckernomics are to the early 1980s what Watergate was to the early 1970s-the biggest continuing story in Washington . " Dealing with Volcker has posed a unique problem for Beckwith : " He is the first person I have covered in 15 years of journalism that I literally have had to look up to . At 6 ft. 7 in. , he tops me by an inch and a half . Volcker also likes to joke about his height . ' You 're just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a power forward . ' " <P> The reporters who worked on the story across the country were well aware that this was a subject that mattered to every body-including them . Correspondent BJ . Phillips , newly arrived in Atlanta from New York City and in need of a car , took a look at costs and opted for a new engine and paint job for the 1951 Ford that once belonged to her grandfather . Chicago 's Gary Ruderman signed closing papers on a 60-year-old gingerbread frame house last week . Avoiding the lofty loan rates of local banks , Ruderman financed the house with the aid of a 5% mortgage from the seller . Says Ruderman : " The basement leaks and the porch is collapsing , but it 's ours . " <P> The cover story was written by Senior Writer George Church , with the assistance of Reporter-Researchers Mary Earle and Bernard Baumohl . Church , a suburban homeowner since 1963 , had been thinking about moving back to New York City , but high mortgages and urban real estate prices have quashed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gardener a few more years , " he says . <P> Only Associate Editor Christopher Byron , who edited the cover , had a good word to say about high rates : " They have turned me from a spender into a saver , " he says . " If you can get 14% or even 15% on your money at a bank , why buy an Oriental rug or a Krugerrand ? "
