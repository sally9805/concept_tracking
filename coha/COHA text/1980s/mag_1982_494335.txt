The theater reference above is n't stretched because Lumet handles much of the film theatrically , Many scenes are shot from the fifth-row-center angle , and he uses the theater 's simultaneous two-room composition a few times . For in ? stance , in a fairly long shot , we see New ? man bring his lady-friend home to his apartment . He switches on the light in the kitchen where they come in ; the light has been left on in the bedroom where they will end up . Between the two lighted areas is the living room , which is dark . The composition is V-shaped with the camera at the point of the V and with blackness in between the two lighted places . The V fixes depth and destination . As he often is , Lumet is skillful with his actors . His key achievement is with Charlotte Rampling , Newman 's amour : Lumet almost manages to make her tol ? erable , a Herculean job . He holds down Milo O'Shea , as the judge , which O'Shea always needs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a star actor . From Warden he gets a generous slice off the enjoyable Warden loaf ; and Lumet gets Newman back to acting again . In the past several years Newman has shown that he has one of the rare faces : it does n't age , it purifies . The youthful prettiness is replaced by a moving clarity . ( Think of Gary Cooper , Celia Johnson , Victor SjOstrom , Wendy Hiller . ) But his acting can get lethargic and facile , as it was in Fort Apache , the Bronx . He was better in Absence of Malice , if only be ? cause there he could n't coast on clich ? s : he had to supply the reality missing in the role . In The Verdict he has a reliable traditional role , the Man Who Came Back ; it 's always been juicy , he knows its perimeter , knows its possibilities , knows what he can assume and what he must supply .

This is realistic American film act ? ing at its veristic/imaginative best . On May 1 , 1901 ? the same year W. E. B.

Sterling Brown was born in a house then near and now part of the Howard University cam ? pus . His father was Sterling Nelson Brown , minister of Lincoln Temple Con ? gregational Church , professor of religion at Howard , and for a time member of the District of Columbia Board of Education .

Along with contem ? poraries Allison Davis , Montague Cobb , William Hastie , and Charles Drew , Brown went to Dunbar High School and from there , on scholarship , to Williams , then one of the few New England col ? leges to admit a token one or two Negro students a year . At Williams , Brown re ? members , his classmates had never seen a Negro , and I had hardly ever seen a white man their age . Until I came to Williams , I had never spoken to a white boy except the little son of the drug ? store man where we used to go to get sundaes fur my family , and he and I were friends until Negroes came around with me or whites came around with him .

As a boy in D.C. , Sterling Brown had imitated some of Toomer 's moves on the basketball court .

These Ne ? gro colleges were more important to the Negro folk than Brown knew when , only twenty-two or twenty-three himself , he rebuked a student for falling asleep in class .

" This and other sayings that Sterling Brown heard from the surviving folk in the 1920s and 1930s found their way into the aphorisms he , along with Arthur Da ? vis and the late Ulysses Lee , included in the still unequaled gathering of Ameri ? can Negro writing and folkstuff , The Ne ? gro Caravan ( 1941 ) . BROWN brought this rich folk speech to the literary forms of poetry . And while he wrote the poems for Southern Road ( 1932 ) , Brown honed the principles of critical realism in a regular column for Opportunity . In " Our Literary Audience " ( February 1930 ) , he made close connec ? tions between literature and history , literature and society , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For him the act of writing involved attention to talking and listening as well as read ? ing , the ear as well as the eye . " We are not a reading folk , " he observed and reaffirmed Whitman 's belief : " Without great audiences we can not have great poets . " Brown 's purpose was to develop kinships between liter ? ary forms of expression and an Afro-American audience . And Brown 's work enacts this profound relationship between literature and de ? mocracy . It is his achievement to have fulfilled the complex double purpose of writing poetry worthy of a great audience and of helping to shape that diverse , responsive , critical , and inclusive audi ? ence through his essays and criticism . In his poetry , now gathered in The Collected Poems of Sterling A. Brown ( Harper &; Row , 257 pp. , $12.95 ) , Brown forged an alliance between two essentialtraditions : the American vernacular of critical realism ? of Robinson , Frost , Sandburg ? and the Afro-American ver ? nacular derived from folk speech and folktales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ballads and the blues . Voice , he realized , was the core of his task . Like Dunbar before him , he knew that for oral tradition to survive , the spoken word must he heard on the page . But what was the oral tradition ? In Negro Poetry and Drama ( 1938 ) , Brown noted Dunbar 's idealization of Negro rural life in the dialect poems and commented gently but with the bite of understatement that " No picture of Ne ? gro life that is only pastoral can he fully true . " This was an old battle over the nature of reality going back to Frederick Douglass and beyond , even to the utter ? ance of Phyllis Wheatley . At stake was nothing less than the meaning and direc ? tion of Afro-American idiom and person ? ality . Already in his own folk poems Sterling Brown had answered James Weldon Johnson 's characterization of Negro dialect as " an instrument with but two full stops , humor and pathos . " In his preface to the Book of American Ne ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " there are phases of Negro life in the United States which can not be treated in the dialect either adequately or artistically . " But Johnson was talk ? ing of dialect as a literary convention . Recalling Louis Untermeyer 's remark that traditional dialect was " an affecta ? tion to please a white audience , " Brown added that its practitioners were often " preachers and teachers , consciously lit ? erary , " who " seldom saw the wit and beauty possible to folk speech , the folk-shrewdness , the humanity , the stoicism of those people . " About tradition Brown is committed , critical , and unerringly explicit : I love Negro folk speech and I think it is rich and wonderful , It is not ( ifs and dat with a split verb . But it is " Been down so long that down do n't worry me , " or it is what spirituals had in one of the finest couplets in American literature : " I do n't know what my mother wants to stay here for . This old world ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown , " Dialect , or the speech of the people , is capable of ex ? pressing whatever the people are . " And such expression is the achievement of Brown 's poetry . His best work touchesgreatness . As Alain Locke contended in what remains the finest piece on Southern Road , " The New Negro Folk Poet ( 1934 ) , " Sterling Brown has listened long and care ? fully to the folk in their intimate hours , when they are talking to themselves not , so to speak , as in Dunbar , but actually as they do when the masks of protective mimicry fall . Of course Brown 's poetry comes also from gifts other than that of listening . He makes rhythm , cadence , and a carefully wrought vocabulary reverberate with the experience and feelings of folk charac ? ters . Because he understood that folk speech in poetry . like good dialogue in fiction , is something other than exact imi ? tation of conversation , he was able to create a speech that functions power ? fully both as written and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eye , his sense of line , of heat . It also flows from his sense of tradition and his will to put his gifts to work in literary forms capable of carrying on the great tradition of Afro-American oral culture ? the sorrow songs , work songs , the ballads , the blues . IN THE ACCESSIBLE way of good po- etry , Brown 's folk-spoken ballads and blues poems summon images and voices from that enduring and , in Faulkner 's sense , prevailing Afro-American past so essentially bound up with the nation 's culture and condition . Listen . Hear Big Boy stake out a place in the pantheon of stoical folk heroes : An ' all dat Big Boy axes When time comes to ' to go , Lemme be wid John Henry , steel drivin ' man . Lemme be wid old Jazzbo , Lemme be wid ole Jazzbo Overhear a lifer on the chain gang hold his own by holding it in , honing his fury to the low growl of a last irrevocable word , his hammer in his hand all the while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " soul ; White man tells me ? hunh ? Damn vo ' soul ; Got no need , bebby . To he tole . Listen to the double changes , religious and historical , aspired to in the advice the poet gives old Sister Lou in an idiom tender , strong , and soulfully hers : Notice the changes . The indefinite " somekindaway " yields to the definite " data way " because between the two couplets the fellow has testified to Ma Rainey 's effect on the people , on an occa ? sion when he and the poet were wit ? nesses to her performance . And there is something else . The poet 's idiom be ? comes one with the fellow 's folk speech . The becomes de , and the quotation marks fall away to signify that the poet 's voice has become truly the voice of the folk . In such poetry Brown writes what Yeats called " the book of the people . " Unsurprisingly , in view of Brown 's commitment to critical realism , the song Ma Rainey sings to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blues , " a blues Bessie Smith was moved to write when , riding the train , she witnessed the devastation of the 1927 flood . ( " Bessie had a greater voice , " according to Brown . " Bessie was the empress of the blues , but Ma taught her and Ma was really the authentic folk singer . " ) That authenticity enables Brown , like Ma Rainey , to move the peo ? ple beyond pain and loss to a depth of wonder akin to love , and to a will to overcome . In " Cabaret , " Brown superim ? poses on the Southern landscape a Chi ? cago nightclub scene . Underneath , like the discontinuous layers of allusion in The Waste Land , are other landscapes : the natural one of bottom land and back ? water in Arkansas and Mississippi , the moral one of the folk as they " huddle , mute , uncomprehending , " and beneath these the historical landscape of slavery . Of the 1927 flood Brown recalls : " I was in Missouri teaching then . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi , I saw Arkansas at that time . And then I go into the cabaret the Black and Tan in Chicago and hear the popular muddy water business and the contrast struck me . " In " Cabaret , " an M.C. shows off falsely the Negro chorus girls , his voice receding before the un forgotten voice of a slave auctioneer . These Brown inter ? rupts with two vernaculars , one satiric , the other brooding and biblical , but all of the above yield to the vicious senti ? mentality of the Muddy Water lyrics . In these cabaret landscapes the folk are wholly mute , voiceless . Here the musi ? cians are exploited and worse off spiri ? tually than the Southern Negroes who are casualties of the flood . Here there is no performance in the testamental , reju ? venating manner of the blues , only an entertainment degrading to both Negro personality and tradition . In still other poems Brown assumes the voice of a chronicler who , as poet and storyteller too , weaves fact and fiction , anecdote and legend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice reflects Brown 's fidelity to a vernacular shared by all Americans . The climax of " Strange Legacies , " for in ? stance , is spoken by an " old nameless couple in Red River bottom . " To utter their will to continue in the teeth of their lives ' devastation by the forces of man and nature , they use a vernacular similar to that spoken by Frost 's or Robinson 's people : Guess well give it one mo ' try . Guess we 'll give it one mo ' try . For Brown the courage of actual and legendary heroes like Jack Johnson and John Henry flows from , and is nourished by , the folk . In addition , and here is where American vernacular and Brown 's overall American audience come in , the old nameless couple 's effort and idiom are in the best American tradition . It is a tradition whose democratic voice and responsibility were affirmed by Robert Frost in " In Dives ' Dive , " a poem repeat ? edly quoted and brilliantly commented on by Sterling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to be equal in number of cards , It is nothing to me who runs the Dive . Let 's have a look at another five . Declaring himself once more in the 1970s ? his seventies as well Sterling Brown uttered a confession of faith . I am an integrationist , though that is an ugly word , because I know what segrega ? tion really was . And by integration , not mean assimilation . I believe what the word means ? an integer is a whole num ? ber . I want to be in the best American tradition . I want to be accepted as a whole man . Nothing he has written better testifies to that wholeness of tradition and personal ? ity than " Strong Men . " To make it , Brown cast Carl Sandburg 's vernacular line into the Afro-American vernacular : The strong men keep coming on . ? Sandburg The strong men keep a-comin ' on The strong men git stronger ... Written in 1929 , the poem and its superb refrains express a gathering of forces as Brown anticipates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , women , and children were to do in the South and in Brown 's Washington , D.C. during the 1950s and 1960s . Like so much of Brown 's best work , " Strong Men " recapitulates the past and points the way to the toughness of character and vision required for the struggle in coming days . The same compassionate , continuing , compelling strength marks the more inti ? mate poems . " Long Track Blues " testifies to the grief of love in a particularly haunting way because its singer speaks of losses both calculable and incalcu ? lable , the twin losses of departure and death : Went down to the yards To see the signal lights come on ' Looked down the track Where my lovin ' babe done gone . Red light in my block Green tight down the line Lawdy , let yo ' green light Shine down on that babe online . From the whistle of distant trains , from the expanse of track , from the hurt , Brown 's sure simplicity of rhythm and idiom makes affirming music . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Long Track Blues ? " A book of essays in the works , his memoirs in progress , a poem or two forming in his head , " Sister Goose " and other tales waiting to be told again , at eighty-one Sterling Brown lives the refrain from " Strong Men , " that poem he believes " still tells the essential truth about the position of my people . " Like the arche ? typal Afro-Americans in his poem , he remains out there , exposed , on the line : a strong man , gittin ' stronger .
