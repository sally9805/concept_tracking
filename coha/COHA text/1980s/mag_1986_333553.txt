It is bright and cold along the deserted Connecticut beach , but inside a bar on this fall Sunday afternoon , it is dark and warm and crowded with men . The bar is thick with the sound of gruff voices and the smoke of Top Stone cigars and the odors of stale beer and newsprint from the sports sections of the Bridgeport Post-Telegram , the Boston Globe , the Hartford Courant , the New York Times , the New York Post and the New York Daily News , all of which are strewn about the small room . There is a darkened pool table in the corner . A silent , unblinking pinball machine . A deck of cards scattered across a deserted table . A crude hand-lettered chart on the wall . It lists a series of men 's names alongside numbers , above which is written in block letters , WEEKLY POOL . <P> The only bright light in the room emanates from the TV above and behind the bar . The men hunched over the bar are transfixed by that light , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They sip their shots and beers , puff their cigars , comment on the action  --  " Jeez ! Look at that ! I could throw a better block right now ! "  --  all without taking their eyes from the light . Even the bartender , a small man with a nutcracker face , manages to draw a beer while glancing back over his shoulder at the light . " Who do ya like ? " he says in a shrill voice to no one in particular and then turns back to the tap at precisely the moment that the beer is about to overflow the glass . <P> The men at the bar are in their late 30s , 40s , 50s . Carpenters . Plumbers . Garbage men . Cops . Most of them are exathletes of some distant , local repute who , like most adult American males , must now take their sports vicariously . They arrive at the bar early every Sunday morning . Over coffee and the morning papers , they discuss the day 's odds . " Miami , 2 1/2 over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ya like ? " Opinions are given , denigrated , defended . One of the men , a former semipro baseball pitcher , says to another man who was once his teammate , " You know , I 'm thinking of making a comeback next spring . " His former teammate nods . The ex-pitcher says . " What do you think ? " His former teammate nods again . The ex-pitcher says " Would you like to catch me sometime ? " His ex-teammate looks up and says , " I 'd rather hit against you . " <P> In the afternoon the men turn their attention to the light above the bar , where they root for the Giants or the Jets or , only rarely , the Patriots . They comment on the unfolding action , not with a fan 's admiration but with an insider 's cynical expertise . They see on the television screen a flash from their past , a dim , half-remembered moment from their athletic youth . They call that moment into focus at the bar , embellishing it . An argument ensues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They laugh . The bar door opens . A big , shambling man with a droopy mustache enters with the tender-kneed , left-right stride of a man who 's fallen off too many broncos . He is wearing a goose-down vest , a snap-button shirt , jeans and pointy-toed cowboy boots , all of which look out of place in this working man 's , New England bar . One of the men at the bar glances over his shoulder . He elbows another . Then another . Soon all the men at the bar are glancing over their shoulders . They nod at the man in the vest , make their respectful greetings , then turn back to the light over the bar .
