The decision , which upheld an interpretation of Federal labor law by the National Labor Relations Board , was a setback for organized labor . A number of unions have rules prohibiting resignations when a strike is imminent or in effect . Members who resign and return to work are typically assessed fines equivalent to their earnings during the strike. // According to the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations , the proportion of unions with such rules is relatively small but growing , as unions try to enforce solidarity in an unfavorable climate. // The Court ruled today that the assessing of such fines is an unfair labor practice under the National Labor Relations Act . Writing for the Court , Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. said that restricting the right of union members to resign " impairs the policy of voluntary unionism " central to Federal labor law . <> <> Labor Law Is Cited // Justice Powell noted that the same section of the National Labor Relations Act that guarantees employees the right to bargain collectively also guarantees " the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said that because the labor board " has the primary responsibility for applying the general provisions of the act to the complexities of industrial life , " the board ' s view that this language protects the right to resign " is entitled to our deference. " // The lower Federal courts have been divided on the issue . The decision today affirmed a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit , in Chicago . That court upheld unfair labor practice charges against the Pattern Makers ' League of North America , a union representing workers who make patterns for casting metal. // The union ' s constitution bars resignations " during a strike or lockout , or at a time when a strike or lockout appears imminent . " After the union assessed fines against 10 members who resigned in a three-month strike in 1977 , an employers ' association in Illinois and Wisconsin filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board. // In a similar case , the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit , in California , refused last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers committed an unfair labor practice by fining members who resigned in a strike .

Blackmun said the decision was supported neither by the specific language nor the general goals of the National Labor Relations Act. // He said the decision " improperly restricts a union ' s federally protected right to make and enforce its own rules , and at the same time traduces the broader aim of Federal labor policy implicated by this right : to preserve the balance of power between labor and management by guaranteeing workers an effective right to strike. " // The majority ' s reliance on " an unspoken concept of voluntary unionism , " Justice Blackmun said , " threatens the power to act collectively that is at the center of the act .

" // The majority said this section referred only to a union ' s right to set terms for admitting or expelling members . The dissent said the section referred much more broadly to " the basic right of all membership associations to establish their own reasonable membership rules. " // Justice Powell ' s majority opinion , Pattern Makers v. N.L.R.B. , No. 83-1894 , was joined by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Associate Justices Byron R. White , William H. Rehnquist and Sandra Day O ' Connor. // Associate Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall joined Justice Blackmun ' s dissenting opinion .

He said that while the labor board ' s interpretation of the law ' s " imprecise language " was " sensible , " there was " nothing in the legislative history to indicate that the board ' s interpretation is the only acceptable construction . " Deference to the board in such ambiguous circumstances , he said , " is not only appropriate , but necessary. " // The A.F.L.-C . I.O. , in a statement reacting to the decision , said that " the Reagan Labor Board is not worthy of such trust by the courts . " The statement said the ruling would make it harder to conduct effective strikes but that the labor board ' s " ultimate objective - to cripple labor unions - will not be achieved .

In the decision today , N.L.R.B. v.
