A new technique that could help the body to defend itself <P> When it is invaded by a foreign substance-a virus or bacterium , say , or even the cells from a donated kidney or blood transfusion-the healthy body quickly mobilizes the immune system for a counterattack . Among the forces sent into combat are antibodies , tiny molecular missiles that attach themselves to the intruder 's surface and help destroy the invader . They are highly efficient and selective ; each antibody is so exquisitely designed that it matches up precisely with only one site on the invader or antigen , almost as if it were a key fitting into a lock . <P> Because antibodies can seek out even minute amounts of a foreign substance , they are an extremely valuable medical tool . Doctors can use them to match donor and recipients for everything from blood transfusions to kidney and heart transplants ; if antibodies from the potential recipient " recognize " anything in the donated tissue as " foreign , " the chances are that the transplant will be rejected . In the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , possibly including a cancer therapy . <P> But such promising applications have encountered a major block : human antibodies , obtained from the blood , can be collected only in tiny quantities . Now that task may become easier . At an immunology conference in Paris , two Stanford University researchers announced that they had produced human antibodies by ingenious alternative means : tiny cells especially bred to act as miniature antibody factories . <P> The technique builds on pioneering work with mice done five years ago by Csar Milstein and Georges Khler in Britain . By injecting foreign substances into the animals , they stimulated the production of antibodies against the invaders . Then they removed the animals ' spleens , a major site for antibody production , and mixed the organ 's antibody-producing cells with cancer cells . The result : hybrid cells , dubbed hybridomas , that inherited from the spleen the ability to produce antibodies and from the malignant cells the ability to replicate themselves indefinitely . These hybridomas produce identical copies of themselves-clones - and thus serve as minifactories for the manufacture of what researchers call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells is foreign to humans and likely to trigger an immune reaction . So Stanford 's Drs . Lennart Olsson and Henry Kaplan set out to create human hybridomas . They took spleen cells from victims of Hodgkin 's disease , a form of cancer in which the spleen is usually removed during treatment . The cells had already been exposed to the chemical dinitrochlorobenzene and were making antibodies . These cells were then fused with cancerous bone-marrow cells , yielding hybrid cells that could churn out the antibody.
