Anwar el-Sadat , a famous man , is dead . An unknown soldier is the new ruler of Egypt . As a first step toward assessing President Hosni Mubarak 's prospects , I recommend that we ignore his slim biographical file and instead try to understand why Sadat was killed . The U.S. and Egyptian governments and the media of both countries have provided reassuring answers . First , there was a breakdown in security . Second , and more important , the assassins were a handful of Moslem fundamentalist " fanatics " who were not part of a larger conspiracy and who did not represent any significant segment of the Egyptian people . It would be a mistake , it seems to me , to overemphasize the failure of security . Sadat , after all , had a cavalier attitude toward threats to his life . He saw himself as " the father of the Egyptian family " and relished mingling with his " children , " 99.9 percent of whom , he continually assured us , supported his policies . The soldiers , in particular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulletproof vests or plastic shields . Our attention , rather , should be directed toward the assassins  --  the so-called " Moslem fanatics . " Just how extreme were the views of these young men ? Were they deviants , totally out of touch with the rest of the nation ? This seems unlikely . Egypt is a much more cohesive society than our own ; it has few loners . The young men who killed Sadat acted with coordination and unswerving determination . The Egyptian authorities have told us that the assassins were members of a Moslem society called Takfir wa Hijra , or Repentance and Exodus . The group first came to national attention in 1977 when several of its members abducted a former Minister of Religious Affairs in an effort to force the release of some Takfir members from prison . The plan backfired . Sadat would not budge , and the group carried out its threat to kill its hostage . A roundup of about 1,000 Takfir adherents followed . Shukri Ahmed Mustafa , the group 's leader , and four of his followers were hanged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Egyptian people . " I am the Prince , and we will inherit the earth , " he shouted to the spectators in the courtroom . He was an awesome figure with shoulder-length black hair , a full beard and wild , piercing eyes . His disciples refused to Stanley Reed is a journalist and specialist on Near Eastern affairs who resided in Cairo from 1976 to 1980 believe he was dead for weeks after the execution was officially announced . In 1979 , I located Mustafa 's widow , his children and his brother-in-law in their native Asyut , and they told me the story of his life . Mustafa spent most of the 1960s in prison after having been convicted of being a member of the illegal Moslem Brotherhood , the precursor of present-day fundamentalist groups . During this time , he broke with the Moslem Brothers , charging them with a lack of commitment and militancy . The savage treatment meted out by Gamal Abdel Nasser 's jailers convinced him that Egypt 's military rulers had plunged the country into barbarism , and after his release he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " into the barren territory east of the Nile Valley . There they sought to establish a society of purity and justice , and also engaged in paramilitary training . Following his execution , Mustafa became a martyr to many Moslems . By 1977 , Takfir had about 4,000 adherents throughout Egypt , including a few students at the American University in Cairo . Saad Ibrahim , an Egyptian sociologist , conducted interviews with many jailed leaders of the group in 1978 and 1979 and found that 80 percent of the students in the group had matriculated in medicine , engineering , pharmacology and military technology , which meant they had received top grades on the nationwide entrance exams . " If they were not typical , " he concluded , " it was because they were above average . " There are many groups in Egypt similar to Takfir , though perhaps not so eccentric , including Jihad and the Soldiers of God . Collectively they are known as the Gamaat al-lslamiya ( the Islamic Societies ) . Their membership is conservatively estimated at 100,000 .

The basic political appeal of the societies is the hope they offer of social change . Many bright , idealistic Egyptian youths have grown disillusioned with secular politics  --  with good reason . Nearly thirty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , the same coterie of men from the military and the upper class is still in power . The religious societies have the familiar puritanical goals  --  banning the consumption of alcohol and imposing " modesty " on women , but , surprisingly , they derive much of their strength from economic discontent . They teach that it is the ruler 's responsibility to provide social justice and to close the wide gap between rich and poor . Sadat performed inadequately by these standards . His " open door " economic policy catered to businessmen and foreigners and placed a low priority on programs that benefit the poor . To take only one example , very little low-cost housing was built during his rule . As a result , many Egyptian youths have had to delay marriage , and this has created social tension . Tens of thousands of Cairenes have solved the housing problem in a macabre way : they have taken up residence in the vast tracts of tombs east of the city . Egyptian Marxists offer a far more cogent analysis of the economic system than do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suspect . Also , most Egyptian Marxists come from the upper class and are considered part of the elite . Activist Moslem groups are not a new phenomenon in Egyptian history . The Moslem Brotherhood was a powerful voice for political change during the 1930s and 1940s . With its 500,000 members , the Brotherhood in effect constituted an alternative government . It owned businesses and helped the poor . Members of the Brotherhood considered themselves soldiers " enlisted to spread the message of Islam , " and the organization sent its own troops to fight in the 1948 war with Israel . Its goal was to make Egypt a fit place for good Moslems to live , and acts of terrorism were considered Justifiable means to this end . On the Prophet 's birthday in 1940 , 21-year-old Anwar elSadat met Sheik Hassan al-Banna , the Brotherhood 's Supreme Guide , in an army mess hall . The encounter led to several meetings between the Moslem Brothers and Sadat and his young officer friends . In Sadat 's case these meetings took place over the course of many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being implicated in a plot to murder Amin Osnan , the Minister of Finance , Banna helped support his family . Although few of Sadat 's set actually joined the Brotherhood , it taught them discipline . Banna 's persuasive analysis of Egypt 's problems also channeled their inchoate rebelliousness toward specific goals . In a secret meeting at the Cairo Zoo in 1944 , an aide of Banna 's urged Sadat 's colleague Gamal Abdel Nasser to begin organizing cells in the army . This conversation profoundly affected Nasser ; as a result of it he formulated his plan to overthrow King Farouk . The Brotherhood welcomed Nasser 's 1952 coup , but Nasser would not tolerate the existence of a large armed organization that many Egyptians believed had God on its side . When a Brotherhood assassin fired eight shots at him in 1954 , he moved to crush the society , and thousands of its members were sent to prison camps during the 1950s and 1960s . As a kind of public test of Sadat 's loyalties , Nasser appointed him to the military tribunal that directed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nasser 's cautious approach and set about using religion for his own political purposes . He cast himself as the " believing " president and made a public event of his Friday prayers . This was partly to please his early paymaster , Saudi Arabia . In hopes of countering the left , which he mistakenly considered his main enemy , he allowed survivors of the Brotherhood purges to publish inflammatory anti-Camp David , anti-Christian and anti-Jewish articles in their magazines a ! Daawa and al-Itisam . He also played on the religious theme in foreign affairs , portraying the Camp David accords as linking him , a Moslem , to the born-again Christian Jimmy Carter and the Orthodox Jew Menachem Begin . The Iranian revolution brought Sadat to his senses , but by then the Islamic groups had taken advantage of his tolerance and become a sizable threat . These groups probably regard Sadat 's assassination as a patriotic act . In their view he was an abomination He had forced Egypt into an unholy alliance with the United States , abandoned the Palestinian cause to negotiate with Israel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had not done since the time of King Farouk . The final outrage was last month 's roundup of 1,536 dissidents , many of them fundamentalists . The leaders of every political tendency from Marxism to liberalism to Moslem fundamentalism were imprisoned . Even the vice president of the Socialist Labor Party , which Sadat helped found three years ago as a " constructive opposition , " was arrested , along with the editorial staff of the party 's newspaper . These events confirmed something that many observers in Cairo knew but that the American press had failed to report : most Egyptians no longer admired Sadat or supported his policies Opposition to the Camp David accords , which had come to symbolize everything negative about Sadat , was widespread . During the past two years , eighty prominent Egyptians signed statements demanding , among other things , that Sadat " freeze all agreements and relations with Israel " and draw up " an alternative policy to . . . Camp David , a policy that would restore to Egypt a pan-Arab liberation line and its leading position .

Among the signers were two former vice presidents , a former prime minister and nine former cabinet ministers , all of whom served under Sadat . What will Mubarak 's first steps be ' ? A man who knew both Sadat and Mubarak well reminded me that while Sadat only served in the army for a few years , Mubarak ' was a career officer . " He will play the role of a military man ondomestic dissent , stressing discipline , " he said . But police state tactics are unlikely to succeed . " Excessive measures against democracy and the repression of the opposition will only result in more violent action , " argues a remarkably bold leftist pamphlet distributed after the assassination . Egyptians expect their rulers to provide at least the illusion of progress . Nasser , for all his faults , made them think that they were in control of their own destiny and that their nation was the leader of the Arab world . Sadat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living conditions .
