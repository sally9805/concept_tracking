Dear Miss Manners-The aunt who reared my brother and me died recently . As she was an avid sailor , she had requested that her body be cremated and the ashes be sprinkled on the river that flows by her home . We complied with her wishes , taking a good-sized sailboat out to the center of the river , where we anchored . There , poems and a prayer were read , and all eight of us drank a toast to my aunt , using her favorite wine . Flower petals and small bouquets were thrown on the water after the ashes . Then we started to sail back . At this point , my brother ' s girlfriend made a dash to the galley , where I could see she was putting out cocktail peanuts , chips and dip , and a plate of appetizers . I was appalled . I asked her not to do this , as we would be partaking of the food the neighbors had brought as soon as we reached the dock . My brother says I was out of line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a funeral , and shouldn ' t to this type of service , either . Gentle Reader-What type of service ? You improvised this occasion , and so there are no universally recognized rules for it . Who is to say that wine is correct but that some food to go with it is not ? Miss Manners is not saying that you did not do an appropriate and dignified job of memorializing your aunt as she would have wished-only that you have no call to be appalled at what was , after all , a very slight extension of your plans . The young lady didn ' t put on a bikini or pull out a fishing rod. - Dear Miss Manners-For years , as a complimentary gesture , I have often commented , when greeting a friend I haven ' t seen for a while , " My , you look as if you ' ve lost some weight . " My thought was that most people are self-conscious about being overweight , and a remark that they have lost weight would be a compliment . A friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not in good taste . " I told her that several of my female friends seemed so pleased with my observation of their weight reduction that they almost kissed me . Am I being rude or forward ? Gentle Reader-It may well be true that most people would like to be thinner than they are ( which is not the same thing as saying that most people are overweight ) and will go into ecstasy at your remark . But it is extremely dangerous to count on such generalizations when you select personal remarks to make to friends . As a matter of fact , statistically you are apt to find , one of these days , that you have encountered someone whose weight loss is due to severe illness or stress . Miss Manners warns you that that person is not going to greet your intended compliment with a kiss . It is for such reasons that politeness requires your compliments to be just a little less pointed . " Why , how wonderful you look ! " will achieve the desired effect without the danger. - Dear Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the manager of personnel development and education . He is an elderly gentleman . Quite a few times he referred to other people ' s secretaries as their " girl . " I corrected him on many occasions , saying it was very rude and demeaning . He insisted it was proper and said I was just being extremely picky . I cringed every time I heard it , and I ' m sure he ' s still doing it . I still work for this corporation . Please help me set this guy straight . Gentle Reader-Miss Manners took a good look at the postmark on this letter and was surprised not to find that it had passed a decade in transit . Then she began to wonder where this gentleman has been spending the last few decades . For his sake and the sake of the company , you must tell him that times have changed . It was never correct to refer to an adult employee as a girl , but it was usual . To do so now that it no longer is common is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated in the company-not the message a personnel department generally wishes to send . It is too bad that he has interpreted your explanation to be an idiosyncratic complaint . The next step is to send a gently worded memorandum from the company ' s female staff that they would all like to have the practice discontinued. -
