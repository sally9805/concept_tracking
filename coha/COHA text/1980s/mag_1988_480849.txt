At my particular age , forty-four ( neither exactly young nor exactly old is how that feels ) , most partisan arguments aimed at proving some general truth about the world resolve themselves ? in my mind anyway ? into what I think of as nice , existential equilibrium : almost nothing seems to be generally true , almost nothing generally false , so that the best anyone can do is find his own way , reveal it as such , and go on hopefully . Counsel , real counsel , in the way Walter Benjamin meant it ? useful words about human life ? is and always has been very hard to come by . Benjamin believed counsel was the great virtue of told stories , those spoken in the human voice by wise travelers , and that in them the righteous man might encounter himself in the person of the storyteller . Which was all very well when we had plenty of those tellers , whose faces we knew , out and around visiting homes without TVs , where people passed their evenings weaving and spinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slews of young writers stay up nights , letting no one in , trying their best to write well and be read , at a time when books are popularly conceived of as Richard Ford 's collection of stories , Rock Springs , will be published in paperback next month by Vintage . This essay will appear in somewhat different form as the introduction to The Pushcart Prize , XIII : Best of the Small Presses . cordless miniseries , and getting read is hard . Both giving and taking counsel require adapting , I guess . The human voice must be listened for more freely and also more acutely . The righteous man , whoever he is , needs to take consolation more willingly , and be ready to encounter himself less in the person of the storyteller or even in the tale told properly , and more in the fabric of a life which might simply be like his . After all , even Benjamin admits that counsel is " less an answer to a question than a proposal concerning the continuation of a story which is just unfolding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970 , ready to begin being a writer , there seemed to hold sway in the country a kind of conventional wisdom regarding writing , and particularly getting started writing ; a protocol for getting work ( stories , in my case ) published into the world and eventually read by real readers. * I 'm no longer sure that such a protocol exists in the minds of young writers today . 1 do not even know why we thought what we thought . But we thought it , acted on it . And for some people it worked out fine , while for others ? me ? it did n't . Wisdom was that for young writers there was a particular " publishing world " out there , a world divided into hemispheres . One hemisphere ' Readers are people you do n't know or are n't related to . was the sub-world of small presses , literary magazines , university reviews . And the other , more brilliant upper half was the world of large-circulation , widely read , money-paying , famous-making magazines printed on slick pages , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York and Boston . The Big Time this was . What we ? or at least I ? understood about this whole world was that I needed to " break into it . " There was a " level " I could empirically find by sending my stories out ? literary magazines were where one started ? and either getting them back or having them approved and published . Good stories were to be found there , it was alleged , and mine would stand a chance . Once I 'd done that , broken into print , I could try to " move up " to better , more widely read and distributed magazines ? there was a floating sense of which were better than others . My work , my name would begin to get around . I would see some action . Acceptance would be a word I 'd hear more . Money would rarely change hands , but I was not in this for money ( and , truly , I was n't ) . All this would go along for a while , years perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work published , while my name on a manuscript began to be associated with good writing ; until , by some act of providence , a story of mine would get " taken " upwards by an editor from the other world , the did n't work for me . Oh , it worked for others well enough . Some of the finest , most admirable writers writing today have gone up through these ranks , their good stories published , their readership solidly banked by their earliest admirers . And some writers , of course , simply ignored this whole ladder-and-rung business alto . gether , sent stories to the New Yorker or the Atlantic , got the good word straight away , hit the ground running , and have never looked back . Much maligned now by spoilsports , such early and great success must 've been very sweet . I 'd have handled mine admirably , I 'm sure . In any case , all formulas for creating one 's writing life break down once the first term ? / write a story ? is put into place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published . I sent them to many ? very many ? of the magazines that were on everyone 's checklists . ( Actual , mimeographed lists were eventually compiled by who-knows-what mysterious samaritan using the Writer 's Digest and some unverifiable word-of-mouth about publications generously , if inexplicably , courting unpublished writers . ) I kept a log , a little notebook in which I had lined off little boxes , inside which I wrote where this story was sent and when , when it came back , where it went next . Somebody ? I forget who now ? told me this is what I should do . I needed to be orderly . Systematic . It was serious business I was up to . The strangling horror that a story would be accepted at two or perhaps three magazines at once , the embarrassment , and bad editorial blood this would cause to flow , could all be avoided this way . Meanwhile , the system , my logging in dates and destinations like a shipping clerk , would give me something to do while I awaited my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news . And there was n't . I was persistent . I kept my stories out . I furrowed my brow over levels . Maybe the Cimarron Review was just too good for me at this point ; I should send a story to a magazine with a less resolute name . I remember one called the Fur-Bearing Trout , where I was chattily turned down by an editor who said he did n't like short stories longer than eight pages , though they need not be about fish . I pulled strings ? any ones I thought I had . To Sumac , a magazine in Michigan , I wrote that 1 was a graduate of Michigan State . That seemed cagey . To a magazine in Mississippi I bragged I was a native . No dice . I got my friend whom the Cimarron Review firmly admired and regularly published to recommend me . No again . I even got an old reacher who had once taught Willie Morris at Texas to middleman a story to Harper 's Magazine ? shooting , just once , for the moon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope he 's happy , wherever he is ) asked me to revise a story I 'd sent to his magazine , TransPacific . Though when I eagerly did and returned it to him , he ignored my new version , but asked me to badger my local library ( which happened to be the Chicago Public Library ) into subscribing and inserting his magazine onto its shelves . I admit it-1 wrote him promptly and suggested where he ought best insert his magazine , whereupon he dispatched to me a three-page , single-spaced letter full of invective and threat in which he periodically used the red half of his ribbon for emphasis , and in which he called me " sonny , " " sport , " " ace , " " junior , " a " simpleton , " a " sorry , petulant fool , " and an " ignorant motherfucker . " To his credit , though , he also wrote this to me : " I devote most of my waking hours to the attempt to promote the careers of people like you , ace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by writing every one personally , so they know there 's a real person here , who knows who they are and who does read what they write .... My wife , who is acting now as the business manager , tells me you 're not a subscriber . That 's okay ? relatively few care about preserving the means by which young writers in America findpublication ? shit now , junior , they just want to get PUBLISHED1 l i II " " Published " was one of those words typed in red . Seasoning , I think this is called . Dues paying . Learning the ropes . Getting my feet wet . Starting at the bottom . I was doing this . Only nobody liked my stories . Finally a call came from a friend in California . A magazine , he said , in New Zealand was interested in new American writing . Maybe I could send something there . New Zealand , I thought , gazing out my window at an unpromising winter sky . A nice place . English spoken there . New Zealand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took my story , even asked for another , which I sent and they agreed to publish soon . And for a time in the winter of 1971 , I thought very , very fondly about New Zealand , about what good people were there . Readers . People willing to give you a chance . Careless of trends , vogues , reputations . It was summer there , then . I thought of Mr. Peggotty in David Copperfield , sailing off to Australia : " We will begin a new life over theer , " is how he put it . Exuberant . Valiant . 1 considered a move . First , though , I fastidiously entered the titles of my two stories and their new " homes " into my logbook beside the word " accepted , " and into the heretofore empty space on my curriculum vitae reserved for publications . New Zealand . It seemed farther away there on that page than when the happy letters had arrived . I wondered for a moment what someone would think who saw these entries , what sort of writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperation inhabited me that I needed to send my stories all the way there . Would they realize the North American serial rights for each story were still intact , and I could still publish the stories stateside if I wanted to ? Or if someone else wanted to ? And who would ever read these stories ? The editors ? all good fellows ? liked them , paid them compliments . But no one else ever weighed in with praise or complaint or notice of any kind . All was quiet . And in a month I decided not to move to New Zealand . Not yet . It was n't going anyplace , after all . Though neither was I. I went back to circulating my stories . Epoch , North American Review , Red Clay Reader , New American Review-where I 'd read some writers whose names I knew . Philip Roth , William Gass , Robert Coover . I quit writing cagey cover letters . My own " production , " however , was beginning to slow . I 'd written eight or so stories , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming confused about my " style . " My logbook was filled up . A student journal at a small Ohio college agreed to print a story , but one I 'd written three years ago ! When I was just starting school ! The editor loved it : " If you can write like this , " I remember his letter saying , " you should be writing for the slicks . " Only I could n't write like that an I 'd " developed " beyond this . Maybe I should n't have . What did he know ? It all got me down . That much I can tell you . Stories would whistle back into my mailbox just ahead of a dark mistral . I 'd read the enclosed letters , check to see if the story was still clean and enough undented by paper clips to send out again , gulp down some bearable bitterness , and then just quit for the day . Usually I 'd have a drink about 10:45 in the morning and take a long walk until my wife got off work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then , unsuddenly , I quit ' among avant-gardists and inside the better , more progressive graduate writing programs , which asks : Is it not almost always the case that you can tell a good story by the fact that very few people like it ? Considering , however , who were the few who liked my stories , I did not feel I had the full comfort of even that befuddling wisdom . And , in any case , I wanted people to like my stories . More importantly , I wanted people to read them , even if they could n't like them . l believed ? or I came to believe that winter ? that writers , the ones I cared about , and even myself , wrote to be read ; not to aggrandize themselves in cringing elitism , not to please or psychoanalyze themselves by getting closer to their feelings , and not , indeed , just to be published and to fill that empty space on a r ? sum ? . Writers wrote , I concluded , not even to appeal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious language the most important things they were capable of , and to reveal this to others with the hope that it will commit an effect on them ? please them , teach them , console them . Reach them . I , it was plain , was n't succeeding here . Nobody was reading my stories because , I decided , they simply were n't very good ? not good enough . anyway . Maybe I knew it in my back-brain ; maybe 1 just trusted the editors who sent them all back to me . But I knew it . It 's true I 've always trusted rejection more than acceptance ( at the time I 'd had more experience with rejection ) . But it 's also true that I came to believe that no good writing would go unpublished . Perhaps this was just the original , free , and blind act of writer 's faith , but if so , it seemed to me collateralized by the lavish evidence of so much awful writing ? even if not mine ? routinely finding its " home " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain practical matters became apparent to me . I did not write very fast . I wrote hard , but at my pace I would never get the proper amount of low-level publishing experience to move up through the ranks . Too few at hats , you could say . Moreover , I did n't like the whole major league/ minor league premise of that conven tional wisdom I 'd inherited . I read the magazines I 'd been submitting to , as well as the ones I wished I could , and I could n't see evidence that the premise worked very well . Plenty of terrible stories were popping up in both leagues . There was reason to believe , in fact , that not a whole lot of really excellent writing got done , or probably ever did . That , of course , is still the case , though it does n't discourage anyone , nor should it . Even more to the point , I began to resent what seemed to me the unprovable premise that there existed any useful structure or scheme of ascendable rungs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first but might be better later on ; and that I should have patience and go on surrendering myself to its clankings . What I felt was that I wanted my stories to be great stories , as good as could be written . . And now . And if they were n't ( and they were n't ) that was my own business , my problem , not the concern of some system for orderly advancement in the literary arts , some wisdom kept presumptuously active by wretched , grad-student magisters sitting before piles of mss. , or else some already belly-up writer who 'd changed boats middle-course and fallen into being an " editor . " I had hard thoughts that winter . But I meant my failings to be my own affair . Some people , I guess , thrive by deferring to unknown and presumably higher authority , to the benevolence of vast , indistinct institutions . And , of course , it 's never a simple matter when your life requires submitting to the judgment of others . We all accommodate that . But most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me not so adept at discerning and respecting underlying design , but at trying to invent designs anew . What was out there , I thought eighteen years ago , and think even more this minute , is not a structure for writers to surrender to , but fidgety , dodgy chaos . And our privileged task is to force it , calm it to our wills . by the various drafts and revisions and rejection notices that lodged with them , and dedicate myself to writing a novel , which I assumed would take years , and did . Not that I propose this strategy for anyone else . My belief about starting novels , and particularly the first one , is that you treat the impulse like the impulse to marry : solemnly , and with the proviso that if you can talk yourself out of it you should . And if you ca n't , then there 's no advice to give you . But I needed to get better ? much , much better at what I was doing , and in ways I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take those years ; I could go more slowly ; there was more to work on , get better at . No demoralizing rejections would crash into my mailbox every morning . One might eventually come , but it was far off . And in trade for this easement , this slow-going , this sumptuous usage of my time and youth , I 'd have a novel , maybe , when all was over ? a not inconsiderable achievement . It was a bargain I was only too happy to enter . Thinking back on 1971 , I am even more convinced now than I could 've been then . Not that a commanding philosophy of the writer 's life was forged on this one decision . I still wanted my work published ? that was the only way it would ever get read . This was simply a matter of practical protocol : I decided 1 could do my best at a distance from the preoccupations and the institutions and the thin solaces and the misfires of publication . Said another way , failure at publishing stories where I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my work , which is what 's important . " Success , " which I still calibrate in readers , was withheld , and I somehow was encouraged ? even if it felt different at the time . And it did feel different . 1 dignify my decision now by believing that publication of those first stories might 've just plain shot me in the foot by conferring approval ? of some kind ? on work I wanted to be good but that was n't very good . When I look around in literary bookstores now , and in the back ad pages of magazines , it seems that with patience and resourcefulness every writ-er can find a publisher for everything that 's written ? good , had , mediocre . . And while I wo n't wag a finger at publishing too fast or publishing your buddies or publishing the famous because they 're thought to be " lightning rods of the culture " ( as a famous editor recently admitted ) or even just publishing a magazine that nobody but the editors and their parents will ever read ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cares , anyway-1 have written enough stories myself that " are n't right for us " or that " showed promise " or that " would surely find a home elsewhere " so as to feel sovereignty over this one opinion : publishing work that 's no good probably is n't a very good idea for writers and publishers , either one , no matter where along the literary ladder they happen to be clinging . For writers , it 's hard when no one likes your work , and hard in another way when things begin finally to break for you , but it 's best to try and set your own high standards for what 's good and what is n't ? even if , God knows , you happen to have written the stuff yourself . Finally , small presses , literary magazines , university reviews , do still have a place in my writing life . On occasion they have been willing to publish what ? by my own standards ? have been stories as good as I can write after years of trying . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journals are " where it 's at " for writing in this country , any more than I believe the New Yorker or Esquire are . I 've never been convinced or seen evidence that the audiences for quarterlies with 1,800 readers are any more perceptive or appreciative or forgiving than other putative audiences , or that their editors are any more open-minded , generally willing to take risks , less capricious , less victims of cronyism , or had their ears more finely tuned to excellent writing than anybody else who sets up as a public literary arbiter . True , those slick magazines are run to the tune of profits . Money . But one fellow 's profit is likely to be another man 's principle . Who 's to say whose god is meaner , coarser ? Where it 's at for literature in this country is where it 's always been , ofcourse ? with writers , and what they write . Writing is dark and lonely work , and no one has to do it . No one will even care much if it does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and to try to do it well is enough of an existential errand , enough of a first step , and for whatever my money and counsel 's worth , enough of a last step too .
