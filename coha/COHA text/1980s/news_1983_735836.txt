txt There was a 10-kilometer road race fot Olympic hopefuls last Saturday in this suburb of Los Angeles , and $100,000 in cash was distributed among the top finishers . The winners , Michael Musyoki of El Paso . Texas , via Kenya . and Midde Hamm of Beaumont , Texas , via Sweden , each received $20,000 in the form of huge , foot-pad-shaped checks from the race 's sponsor , the Dr. Scholl 's foot-care-products folks . At the awards ceremony following the event , they and their fellow prize winners . including several Americans , waved their checks for an applauding crowd . It was an edifying spectacle for anyone who thought that track-and-field athletes who strive for Olympic gold could n't pick up more common lucre along the way , at least where anyone could see them . They can , and , what 's more . it 's quite all right . If any of the more-celebrated competitors in the 1981 Games are amateurs by any definition , it will be newsworthy indeed . We Americans were among the last major sports nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golly , we 've pretty much gone and dune it . Our athletes in a number of sports now can endorse products . perform for commercially sponsored clubs and collect prize money  --  and still wear the red , white and blue this winter in Sarajevo and next summer in Los Angeles At a number of track meets , they can even bargain for appearance money , something that some kinds of out-and-out professionals ca n't do openly . The Olympics being the Olympics , things are not as straightforward as they might be . Each sport has its own governing body , and their rules regarding the handling of athletes ' emoluments vary . Participants in obscure sports remain amateurs because no one cares to pay them . But in track and field . the most prominent Olympic activity , the good times have started to roll in earnest . The development coincides roughly with the 1979 election of The Athletics Congress ITAC ) as the U S. governing body in the sport , in place of the persnickety Amateur Athletics Union , which had run it from time immemorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amateurs in track for Olympic purposes , reasoning ( correctly ) that athletes from Iron Curtain countries already were pros in every way . It was rebuffed in this by the International Amateur Athletics Federation , track 's world governing body . So instead , TAC followed the lead of other Western nations and set up guidelines that enabled its charges to be paid in a slightly circuitous way . For example . American track athletes can be paid to endorse a product if the company that makes it also contributes a bit to TAC . They can be " supported " as members of commercial track clubs ( most of the big athletic-shoe companies have them ) , although the word " salary " is daintily avoided . And they can accept prize money ( euphemistically dubbed " participation fees " or some such ) as long as they deposit it in a trust fund and report their withdrawals to TAC . Each athlete has his own trust fund . and he can put it in any financial institution he chooses . From it , he can withdraw funds for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and training , and when his track days are over he can do what he likes with what 's left . If this sounds like the way most of us handle our paychecks , it 's no accident . " I suppose we might object if a guy uses a withdrawal to buy his girlfriend a diamond bracelet , but just about anything else would be okay , " says a TAC spokesman . The main beneficiaries of the new rules have been long-distance runners , no longer lonely now that their events have achieved mass-participation status . Marathoners Frank Shorter and Bill Rodgers are the undisputed kings of Pitchman Road as a result of a long list of lucrative endorsements , and each has a line of running clothes named for him After them come such hot U.S. Olympic-medal prospects as sprinter Carl Lewis , miler Mary Decker and pole vaulter Billy Olsen . Their annual incomes have been estimated in six figures , and while David Greifinger of Los Angeles , Mr. Lewis 's lawyer , calls that amount " exaggerated , " he notes that it wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jumping events in which he is favored . Most Olympic hopefuls get by on a good deal less , of course ; TAC says that about 700 of its members have established trust funds . and that their total value barely exceeds $1 million . Still , for a lot of less-thanfamous runners , that 's more than they had before , and combined with their other track-related income it enables them toprepare full time for the coming Games . One such athlete is Paul Cummings , a 30-year-old father of four who was here to run in the Dr. Scholl 's event . He was a champion miler in college and an American record holder at 1,500 meters before economic necessity forced him to play down running and take a job at U.S. Steel Corp . in Provo , Utah . The track bug would n't let go , however , and now lie 's training for a last shot at the Olympics at 5,000 or 10,000 meters . He can do that largely because of the new rules . He receives what he carefully calls a " stipend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported by the shoe company of the same name , and he represents the firm at clinics and trade shows . Mr. Cummings also earns an occasional check at the races . and he won $1,500 here for a 10th place finish . It will go into his TAC trust-fund account , and from there will pay his grocer , landlord , et al . Running for cash did n't start with TAC  --  competitors took money under the table for years  --  but he thinks it 's nicer this way . " Given the choice , " he says , " I 'd rather do things honestly . "
