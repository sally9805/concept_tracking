Just a few minutes before the TV taping is to start on this sunny Tuesday afternoon , an earthquake strikes San Francisco . But the only tremor felt by ) the crowd filing into a Paramount sound stage 350 miles to the south is one of anticipation . Two women from New Orleans are congratulating themselves on getting into the show twice in three days ( they stood in line for tickets at 7 a.m . ) . A couple of teenage guys from Orange County are making time with two girls they met in line . A twentyish blond from Los Angeles sings the praises of the young comic she is waiting to see : " He 's young , he 's hip , he 's personable , he 's humble . He 's just himself  --  that 's the biggest compliment you can pay him . " <P> Arsenio Hall , at the same moment , has no inkling of the earthquake either . ( The news reaches him later , midway through the show , though he does n't mention it on the air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is in his dressing room , slipping into a stylish double-breasted jacket , glancing briefly at his cue cards and getting some final dabs of makeup . With only seconds to spare , he bops downstairs , wades through a phalanx of enthusiastic staffers , then darts behind a blue translucent curtain . The band blares , the announcer wails . Hall sinks to one knee for a few seconds of silent prayer . Then he slides over to his mark and assumes his opening pose : head bowed , legs apart , hands pressed together . <P> And suddenly the earth really rocks . <P> Hall raises a clenched fist and rotates it in a circle , inspiring the crowd to respond with its trademark barking chant : " Wooh ! Wooh ! Wooh ! " He races over to bandleader Michael Wolff and greets him by touching index fingers . ( No old-fashioned high-fives on The Arsenio Hall Show . ) He bounds in and out of the audience , paying special attention to the folks in the bad seats behind the band . By the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carson signals the start of his show with a decorous golf swing . Hall launches the proceedings with a cry of " Let 's . . . get . . . BUSY ! ! " <P> We are seeing the future of the TV talk show , and it is , well , funky . The Arsenio Hall Show , a weeknightly joyride on 167 stations nationwide , is less a talk show than a televised party : hip , hyperkinetic and hot . The host ca n't sit still , and the crowd ca n't get enough of him . At any moment , Hall might race into the studio audience in response to a shouting fan , or sidle over to his five-piece house band ( " my posse " ) for some impromptu jamming . Meanwhile , as late-night 's first successful black talk host , he has turned his guest couch into TV 's liveliest melting pot . Rap groups get as much attention as Hollywood legends ; George Hamilton or Glenn Close might find themselves rubbing elbows with one of the Jacksons  --  Jesse or Bo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike Tyson could drop in unannounced . Man , this show is loose !
