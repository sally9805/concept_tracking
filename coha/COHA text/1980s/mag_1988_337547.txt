" Now more than ever . " That battle cry helped Kurt Waldheim become President of Austria two years ago , despite an international uproar over his service with German army units that committed atrocities during World War II . But the slogan echoed with bitter irony last week as calls for his resignation mounted in the wake of a report by a panel of historians who concluded that Waldheim , 69 , was well aware of war crimes but did nothing to stop them and then concealed his knowledge . <P> In many schoolrooms across Austria , portraits of the President vanished from the walls . Civil servants in Vienna hung a 100-ft. - long banner from a government office building demanding that Waldheim step down .

In Jerusalem the Israeli Knesset called for Waldheim 's resignation or impeachment in light of the panel 's report . <P> The pressure on Waldheim is likely to grow as Austria prepares for next month 's 50th anniversary of its annexation by Hitler 's Third Reich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dohnal , a Socialist leader : " Anything that will free us from the present position will be welcome as a solution .
