This is the meaning of the NATO foreign ministers ' stern warning in Brussels Dec. 12 that a Soviet invasion of Poland would end detente. // It is not yet clear whether the superimposing of a NATO-Soviet confrontation onto the Soviet-Polish confrontation will deter the Russians . But it is already clear that it stings. // On the day of the NATO notice of retaliation for any invasion , East Germany  --  as the stalking horse for the Soviet bloc  --  threatened counterrelation . If the West ended detente and ended the preferential treatment of East German imports into the European Community ( EC ) , the official East German news agency ADN declared , this could also end Western access across East Germany to West Berlin. // In the harshest Soviet-bloc message to the West yet , ADN asserted : " Everything  --  but everything that . . . has been achieved in past years could be at stake. " // A countermove against West Berlin would be serious , indeed . It would recall the worst cold-war days after World War II . In invoking this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Bonn could lose the most from any end of detente . The Soviet bloc could lose only Western credits and technology ; West Germany , on the contrary , could lose all the East-West German human contacts of the 1970s and even the links to West Berlin of the 1960s. // So far , however , East Berlin ' s retort seems to be less a considered reaction to the NATO stance than a reflex warning to the West not to go too far . Despite the Polish crisis , the exposed city of West Berlin has remained notably calm  --  as the foreign ministers of West Germany , the United States , Great Britain , and France observed in their traditional " Berlin dinner " on the eve of the regular NATO foreign ministers ' meeting Dec. 11 and 12 . Nor would Moscow be likely to stir up trouble over West Berlin gratuitously when the Red Army was already occupied on two other fronts , Afghanistan and Poland. // In addition , the East German threat seems to be less of a response to the overall NATO warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report that Western sanctions might include a halt to preferential treatment of East German exports to the EC . The US secretary of state and West German foreign minister both denied the report , and West German politicians of every stripe rejected such an idea . The current handling of East German products as part of internal EC trade arises from the West German constitutional presumption that Germany ( both East and West ) is one nation ; this preferential tariff treatment is therefore guaranteed in the original EC treaty. // A further sign of Soviet-bloc discomfiture over the NATO position is the surprising Soviet press report of Italian demurral from NATO ' s firm stand  --  and the simultaneous East German press castigation of West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher as one of the most hard-line participants in the NATO council . These would seem to indicate that Moscow has given up hopes of wooing the key Western European country , West Germany , away from the US on a tough reaction to any Soviet invasion of Poland. // Indeed , the unity of the Western foreign ministers was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be , as part of the warning signal to the Soviet Union . In their current attempt at specific deterrence the Western allies are determined not to repeat the mistakes ( including disunity ) that they made at the time of the Soviet invasions of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and of Afghanistan a year ago. // The US mistake in 1968 , as seen by one diplomat involved in Washington ' s evaluations , was not to take seriously enough the possibility of a Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia . In early August 1968 , the State Department accepted at face value the Soviet-Czech reconciliation sealed with a public kiss  --  and dissolved its Czechoslovak task force 10 days before Soviet troops occupied Prague . Washington then had no reaction ready when the Soviet invasion caught Czechs , Americans , and almost everyone else by surprise . America ' s preoccupation with the Vietnam war and anti-war demonstrations  --  headlines about demonstrators at the Democratic convention in Chicago quickly supplanted headlines about Czechoslovakia ' s plight in US newspapers  --  further diluted the American response. // A year ago the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deter the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . But Washington ' s specific warnings fell on deaf ears  --  partly , one participant in this month ' s Brussels talks thought , because of Washington ' s earlier spurious wolf-crying over the Soviet brigade in Cuba . Moscow then did not take seriously the US wolf-crying over Afghanistan  --  and after the invasion professed astonishment that the US was so upset by the move. // After the fact , too , the Western European allies  --  alarmed by President Carter ' s shoot-from-the-hip reactions to both Afghanistan and the seizure of US hostages in Iran  --  helped reinforce Soviet complacence by distancing themselves from the United States . Among other gestures , West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt waited three weeks and finished a vacation before making any major condemnation of the invasion. // This time , all the Western allies are resolved , it will be different . The Soviet Union will know in advance , beyond a shadow of doubt , that it will end detente for years to come  --  with both the United States and Western Europe  --  if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main demurrers from US economic sanctions against Moscow after the invasion of Afghanistan , have thus made it clear that this time their economic interests in trade with the Soviet bloc would not stand in the way of economic penalties . The two countries warned generally in a joint communique last February that any new Soviet invasion of another country would mean the end of detente , and in recent days they have repeated this warning in bilateral Soviet contacts with specific reference to nearby Poland . They have further signaled their evaluation of a Soviet invasion of Poland as the main danger by signing a NATO communique that does not even repeat the standard call for ( American ) ratification of SALT II . ( It does call for continuation of the " SALT process. " ) // The NATO council of ministers has not decided exactly what countermeasures it would apply under what circumstances of a direct or ambiguous Soviet invasion of Poland . It has drawn up a list of possible tough economic , diplomatic , and domestic military responses , however , and it has agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the list in case of an invasion . ( Even a foreign ministers ' meeting turned out to be impossible in the allied disarray after the invasion of Afghanistan. ) // The deterrent signal to Moscow , NATO hopes , is a clear one. // //
