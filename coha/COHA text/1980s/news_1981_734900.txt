txt MY 58-YEAR-OLD sister had the Brat-personal contact of her life with the . Chicago Police Department recently and she was delighted with its performance . Like many taw-abiding citizens , my sister 's only view of the police has been through casual observations on the street and by reading news stories reporting cops who have gotten themselves into trouble . She knew the department was there because she saw its squad cars on the street , She assumed it was doing its job because she never got jackrolled once during the more than 30 years she worked in the Loop , And as a taxpayer , she figured she was getting her money 's worth because the Chicago neighborhoods in which she has ' resided all her life were orderly and generally blessed by an absence of obvious crime . She and her now retired husband never got a parking ticket , never got stopped for speeding , and never had any occasion to call for the police . From their perspective , the Chicago Police Department might have existed on Their job is not only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers take that admonition in the legend on their squad car doors seriously . another planet . And their vantage point was not unlike that enjoyed by thousands of citizens who never need the services of a cop . NOW , ALI , THAT has changed . From this moment on , my sister will notice those blue and white squad cars with new ? appreciation . It is n't because some hero police officer saved her neck at the risk of his own or snatched her property from the hands of a criminal in the nick ' of time . Rather , her encounter with the police was as pedestrian as they come . Pence-men are involved in such minor Meld** - hundreds of times a day and thrilliRoth ing of them . ? To the cops handling the calls , th ? y Are , . all part of a day 's work . : But ; to the gleaming chariot to the Garfield Park flower show . They parked the car in a lot , emerging several hours later to find its rear end smashed . A young woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their car . An off-duty policemen who just happened to be driving by had suspected the lady was about to_the take off without reporting the accident . So he stopped her and was obtaining her name , address , phone number , and the name of her insurance company when my sister and her husband arrived . The officer was courteous to both parties involved . He recommended they drive to the Harrison Street police station to report the incident . Then he went on his way . AT THE STATION , the officers on the desk were equally courteous , taking the time to explain the accident report forms in the midst of responding to other complaints about matters far more serious than a fender bender . One officer even took the time to verify the extent of the damage at the behest of the student driver , who feared her handiwork might later be exaggerated . Then another officer accompanied my sister and her husband outside to point them in the right direction because they had become lost in a strange neighborhood . It was a minor event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister , her first contact with the law was memorable . The off-duty cop did n't have to spend half an hour of his free time preventing an irritation to a citizen he did n't even know . But he did . And the officers on the desk at the Harrison Street station could have justifiably snarled because of the press of other matters . But they did n't . TO A GUY LIKE me , who has spent 30 years watching Chicago cops in action , the incident comes as no surprise . I 've seen it repeated a hundred times . Policemen , after All , know more than most people how difficult life can be Their cars get whacked in parking lots , too . So they know the pain and expense such events can cause when the perpetrator escapes undetected . Futther , their job is not only to protect , bUt to serve . A lot of police officers take that admonition in the legend on their                    @
