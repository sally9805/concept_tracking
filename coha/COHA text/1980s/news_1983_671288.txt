Out of season and unlicensed , the hunt was strictly illegal . But the two waiting men , Detective Dale Leonard and his partner had guaranteed their wealthy client a record bighorn sheep . For $7 , 500 the laws and ethics of hunting were ignored. // What the two illicit guides did not know , however , was that their client was an undercover agent for the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service . Evidence gathered on this and other " guaranteed " hunts led to the breaking of a two-state commercial hunting ring in which hundreds of trophy-sized elk , goats , deer , sheep and bears were slaughtered for sale to farflung collectors. // Law-enforcement officials estimate illicit trade in wildlife parts in the neighborhood of $100 million a year . The high stakes have created a new type of poacher , officials say , who takes wildlife purely for profit . Law-enforcement agents compare them to drug smugglers . <> <> Agents Must Go Under Cover // The sophistication of the poachers has forced Federal wildlife agents to adopt the techniques of other law agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drug Enforcement Administration. // " We ' re the F.B.I. of the wildlife world , " said Terry Grosz , head of the Fish and Wildlife Service ' s Law Enforcement Division in Denver , " The uniformed game warden is almost a thing of the past . These chaps use four- wheel drive vehicles , two-way radios , helicopters , fixed-wing aircraft , nightscopes and spotlights . " In one case , he said , poachers were using a tank trajectory table enabling them to make shots from up to 1 , 200 yards away . All of this equipment is possible , he said , because of the value of wildlife objects. // In the bighorn sheep case , Mr. Leonard pleaded guilty in Federal District Court in Denver to two felony counts last month , and was dismissed from the Denver police force . He has not yet been sentenced . Six other members of the ring have pleaded guilty ; all have been fined and some are serving time . <> <> Value Increases With Scarcity // Law-enforcement officials say the poaching ring , while larger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As species of both game and nongame animals diminish , largely because of habitat loss , they are becoming more valuable to collectors and , increasingly , in folk medicines. // While the hunter in Missoula was charged $7 , 500 for his bighorn , other larger trophies sell for as much as $20 , 000 . The coveted " grand slam , " a head and shoulders , from each of the four wild sheep indigenous to North America , can sell for as much as $50 , 000 . Newly grown elk antlers are worth up to $120 a pound , and each antler can weigh 15 pounds . Arabs , who use birds of prey for hunting , will pay as much as $80 , 000 for a baby gyrfalcon . One man was recently arrested attempting to smuggle a dozen gyrfalcon eggs out of Canada in a suitcase fitted as an incubator. // Poachers can make a profit on almost anything : rattlesnakes , eagles , salmon , walrus , cactus or sea turtle eggs. // Several years ago the agency formed a covert operations branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from other law branches such as such as the F.B.I. , the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency . <> <> Former Narcotics Agent // Richard Leach , head of the covert branch , is a former undercover narcotics agent . He said officers in his branch used fake storefronts , hidden tape recorders and cameras and false identities. // One of the most successful traps the agency has shut was a 15-month purchase of illegally taken reptiles. // Two agents opened a warehouse in Atlanta , and , posing as pet dealers , placed advertisements in magazines and purchased snakes , lizards , turtles and other reptiles . Several dozen people were arrested. // The Leonard case was one of the most difficult , Mr. Leach said . Several agents , including Mr. Leach , posed at various times as hunters seeking guide service from Mr. Leonard. // It can take months or years to build a case , Mr. Leach said. // The prosecution of Mr. Leonard , Mr. Grosz said , was made easier because he took numerous photos of himself and his aides with quarry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr. Grosz , Mr. Leonard served as guide for people from throughout the world . His methods included scouting a certain area for trophy-sized animals and photographing them . He would then send photos to interested clients , and specify a price. // Clients would then either travel to the Rockies and hunt the animal themselves , or have Mr. Leonard send it to them. // In addition to the covert branch of the Fish and Wildlife Service , there are 27 special agents in the country assisting t in undercover work , as well as carrying out field enforcement. // Joel Scrafford , the special agent for Montana , Wyoming and Idaho , showed park rangers at Yellowstone Park one recent windy day how to find and disarm a " getter , " a small explosive device packed with sodium cyanide used illegally to kill black bears for their gall bladder. // Mr. Scafford began wildlife work as a zoologist . When he saw what was happening to wildlife resources , he said , he joined law enforcement . <> <> ' Getting Ripped Off Royally ' // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an organized criminal conspiracy , " Mr. Scafford said in his south Texas accent , holding the cigar-sized getter . " We need strong laws on the books out here . These Western states are getting ripped off royally. " // Commercial trophy hunters are the worst offenders , he said . He asserted they killed many more animals than they sold because of the difficulty in telling whether an animal is a trophy before it ' s killed. // " Our agents have seen these fellows shoot an elk , measure it , and , if it ' s not a record , simply walk away , " he said. // In Mr. Scafford ' s opinion , people who poach are not only in it for the money , but for a type of perverse satisfaction. // " These people love the sheer joy of killing , " he said . " I ' ve read Leonard ' s letters , " Mr. Scrafford said . " ' Dull week at the office - I ' ve got to go out and kill something . ' It ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re the lowest form of life on two legs.
