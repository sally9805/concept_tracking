 | What he intuits from the coolness of her conversation or the moods that come over her is that she did not expect to find herself in her present situation . She is not devious and did not plan this . She seems to take each day as it comes and is clearly forged in her being by the race of men she 's had to deal with . In short , they are equals . The realization sends him to the bottle with a shaking hand . Naturally she would think he was part of the old man 's retinue . It was a natural assumption . At drinks that evening they 're alone . Can I tell you a story ? he says . Outside , the rain is heavy , the kind of rain that tamps down the wind .

People I loved died because of the policies of one of his companies . He owns lots of companies . You know what he 's worth ? Worth ? What can it matter . I have n't got a dime myself , he says conscientiously , as if he 'd made it his life 's achievement . Millions , billions , the power over people . So I was going to kill him . I got through the dogs with just a tear or two and introduced myself out on that terrace there through the dining room one morning with my knife in Illy pocket .

Her arms are folded across her breasts . The doors to her terrace are closed and locked . The curtain is pulled shut . The room smells of cigarettes . He pours the wine . Later they are sitting on the floor beside the bed . He has been telling her about his life . He has recited some of his work . She has listened and smoked and held out her glass for wine .

Then she is lying on the floor in his arms reading his face with judicious solemnity , her eyes gathering up the dim light of the room so widely open that he feels himself pouring into them . Because her spirit is strong he is surprised by the frailty of her . She is a small person . Her breasts are full and her thighs rather short . He can feel her ribs . Her buttocks are hard with a thin layer of sweet softness over them , like a child 's ass . Her mons hair feels lightly oiled . He touches her cunt . She closes her eyes . A queer hitter smell comes off her body . He kisses her soft open mouth and it 's just as he knew , she is here and he 's found her again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is obviously entranced .

But he 'll remember them lying on their backs next to each other and the feel of the hard nap of the carpet on his sweaty skin . He 'll remember that when he turned on his side to look at her the silhouette of her body in the dark was like a range of distant hills . Yes , she said , as if their fucking had been conversation , sometimes nothing else will do but to drive as flat out hard and fast as you can .  | If you listen the small splash is beaver .

They go after the young trees and bring them down ? whole hillsides collapse in the lake when they 're through . They make their lodges of skinned poles , mud and boughs like igloos of dark wet wood and they enter and exit under water and build shelves out of the water for the babies . And when the mahogany speedboat goes by trimmed with silver horns in boom Lake , in the Adirondacks ,  | the waves of the lake inside the beaver lodge lap gently against the children 's feet in the darkness . Loon Lake was once the destination of private railroad cars rocking on a single track through forests of pine and spruce and hemlock branches and fronds brushing the windows of cut glass while inside incandescent bulbs flickered in frosted-glass chimneys over double beds and liquor bottles trembled in their recessed cabinet fittings above card tables of green baize in rooms entered through narrow doors with brass latches . If you step on a twig in a soft bed of pine needles under an ancient stand of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to the Indians of Loon Lake the Adirondack nations , with all due respect . What a clear cold life it must have been . Everyone knew where he stood chiefs or children or malcontents and every village had its lover whom no one wanted who sometimes lay down because of that with a last self-pitying look at Loon Lake before intoning his death prayers and beginning the difficult business of dying by will on the dry hummocks of pine needles . The loons they heard were the loons we hear today , cries to distract the dying loons diving into the cold black lake and diving back out again in a whorl of clinging water clinging like importuning spirits fingers shattering in spray feeling up the wing along the rounded body of the  | thrillingly exerting loon taking a fish rising to the moon streamlined its loon eyes round and red .

And there are stars where that happens too in space in the black space some railroad journeys above the Adirondacks . Well , anyway , in the summer of 1936 a chilling summer high in the Eastern mountains a group of people arrived at a rich man 's camp in his private railway car the men in fedoras and dark double-breasted suits and the women in silver fox and cloche hats sheer stockings of Japanese silk and dresses that clung to them in the mountain air . They shivered from the station to the camp in an open carriage drawn by two horses .

The old man who was their host an industrialist of enormous wealth over the years had welcomed to his camp financiers politicians screen stars European princes boxing champions and conductors of major orchestras all of whom were honored to sign the guest book . Occasionally for complicated reasons he received persons strangely undistinguished . His camp was a long log building of two stories on a hill overlooking Loon Lake . There was a great rustic entrance hall with a wide staircase of halved logs and a balustrade made of scraped saplings a living room as large as a hotel lobby with walls papered in birch bark and hung with the mounted heads of deer and elk and with modern leather sofas with rounded corners and a great warming fireplace of native stone big enough to roast an ox . It was a fine manor house lacking nothing with suites of bedrooms each with its own shade porch and the most discreet staff of cooks and maids and porters but designated a camp because its decor was rough-hewn .

And this party of visitors were really romantic gangsters thieves , extortionists and murderers of the lower class and their women who might or might not be whores . The old roan welcomed them warmly enjoying their responses to his camp admiring the women in their tight dresses and red lips relishing the having of them there so out of place at Loon Lake . The first morning of their visit he led everyone down the hill to give them rides in his biggest speedboat a long mahogany Chris-Craft with a powerful inboard that resonantly shook the water as she idled . Ile handed them each a woolen poncho with a hood and told them the ride was fast and cold but still t hey were not prepared when under way he opened np the throttle  | and the boat reared in the water like Buck Jones ' horse . The women shrieked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coated their faces while the small flag at the stern snapped like a machine gun . And one of the men lipping an unlit cigarette felt it whipped away by the wind . He turned and saw it sail over the wake where a loon appeared from nowhere beaked it before it hit the water and rose back into the sky above the mountain .

Others of this specie : Tom Mix , Tim McCoy , Big Boy Williams . Buck Jones ' horse palomino stallion named Silver . Others of this specie : Pal Feller Tony . The old man rode them around Loon Lake , its islands through channels where beaver had built their lodges and everything they saw the trees the mountains the water and even the land they could n't see under the water was what he owned . And then he brought them in throttling down and the boat was awash in a rush of foam like the outspread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mahogany boats of different lengths were berthed in the boathouse and racks of canoes and guide boats upside down and on walls paddles hanging from brackets and fishing rods and snowshoes for some strange reason and not a gangster there did not reflect how this dark boathouse with its canals and hollow-sounding deck fl(x)rs was bigger than the home his family lived in  | when he was a kid , as big as the orphan 's home in fact . But one gangster wanted to know about the lake and its connecting lakes , the distance one could travel on them as if he was planning a fast getaway . Just disappearing around the corner out of sight was the boathouse attendant . And everyone walked up the hill for drinks and lunch . Drinks were at twelve-thirty and lunch at one-thirty after which , returning to their rooms , the guests found riding outfits laid across their beds and boots in their right sizes all new . At three they met each other at the stables laughing at each other and being laughed at and the stableman fitted them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses began to move without warning ignoring them up there in the saddle threatening to launch with each bounce like a paddle ball . And so each day the best gangster among them realized there would be something to do they could not do well . The unchecked walking horses made for the woods no one was in the lead , the old man was not there . They were alone on these horses who took this wide trail they seemed to know . They were busy maintaining themselves on the tops of these horses stepping with their plodding footfall through the soft earth of the wide trail . By and by proceeding gently downhill they came to another shore of the lake , of Loon Lake , and the trees were cut down here and the cold sun shone . They found themselves before an airplane hangar with a concrete ramp sloping into the water . As the horses stood t here the hangar doors slid open there was a man pushing back each of the steel doors  | although they saw only his arm and hand and shoetops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the far end of the lake an airplane appeared and made its descent in front of the mountain growing larger as it came toward them a green-and-white seaplane with a cowled engine and overhead wing . It landed in the water with barely a splash taxiing smartly with a feathery sound . The horses nickered and stirred , everyone held on and the lead gangster said whoa boy , whoa boy and the goddamn plane came right out of the water up the ramp , water falling from its pontoons the wheels in the pontoons leaving a wet track on the concrete and nosed up to the open hangar blowing up a cloud of dirt and noise . The engine was cut and the cabin door opened and putting her hands on the wing struts a woman jumped down a slim woman in trousers and a leather jacket and a silk scarf and a leather helmet which she removed showing light-brown hair cut close and she looked at them and nodded without smiling and that was the old man 's wife .

He revealed that she was a famous aviatrix and some of them recognized her name from the newspapers . He spoke proudly of her accomplishments the races she won flying measured courses marked by towers with checkered windsocks and her endurance flights some of which were still the record for a woman . After dinner he talked vaguely of his life his regret that so much of it was business . He talked about the unrest in the country and the peculiar mood of the workers and he solicited the gangsters ' views over brandy on the likelihood of revolution . And now he said rising I 'm going to retire . But you 're still young said one of the gangsters . For the night the old man said with a smile I mean I 'm going to bed . Good night . And when he went up the stairs of halved tree trunks they all looked at each other and had nothing to say . They were standing where the old man had left them in their tuxes and black tics.  | They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stood and quietly as they could they all went to their rooms , where the bedcovers had been turned back and the reading lamps lighted . And in the room of the best gangster there a slim and swarthy man with dark eyes , a short man very well put together there were doors leading to a screened porch and he opened them and stood on the dark porch and heard the night life of the forest and the lake and the splash of the fish terrifyingly removed from Loon Lake . He had long since run out of words for his sickening recognition of real class nervously insisting how swell it was . He turned back into the room . His girl was fingering the hand-embroidered initials in the center of the blanket . They were the same initials as on the bath towels and on the cigarette box filled with fresh Luckies and on the matchbooks and on the breast pockets of the pajamas of every size stocked in the drawers the same initials , the logo .

He locked his hands behind his head and ignored the girl and lay in the dark not even smoking . But at three that morning there was a terrible howl from the pack of wild dogs that ran in the mountains not wolves but dogs that had reverted when their owners could n't feed them any longer . The old man had warned them this might happen but the girl crept into the bed of the gangster and he put his arm around her and held her so that she would not slip off the edge and they listened to the , howling and then the sound nearer to the house of running dogs , of terrifying exertion and then something gushing  | in the gardens below the windows . And they heard the soft separation together with grunts and snorts and yelps of flesh as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl said and the gangster felt her breath on his collarbone and smelled the gel in her hair , the sweetness of it , and felt the gathered dice of her shoulders and her shivering and her cold hand on his stomach underneath the waistband . In the morning they joined the old man on the sun terrace outside the dining room . Halfway down the hill a handyman pushing a wheelbarrow was just disappearing around a bend in the path . I hope you were n't frightened , the old man said , they took a deer and he turned surprisingly young blue eyes on the best gangster 's girl . Later that morning she saw on the hills in the sun all around Lake Loon patches of color where the trees were turning and she went for a walk alone and in the woods she saw in the orange and yellowing leaves of deciduous trees the coming winter imagining in these high mountains snow falling like some astronomical disaster and Loon Lake as the white hole of a monstrous meteor and every branch of the evergreens all around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny snowfall precisely imitative of itself . And at dinner she wore her white satin gown with nothing underneath to ruin the lines . And the old man 's wife came to dinner this night clearly younger than her husband , trim and neat with small beautifully groomed lands and still young shoulders and neck but brackets at the corners of her mouth  | She talked to them politely with no condescension and showed them in glass cases in the game room trophies of air races she had won small silver women pilots silver cups and silver planes on pedestals . Then still early in the evening she said good night and that she had enjoyed meeting them . They watched her go . And after the old man retired and all the gangsters and their women stood around in their black ties and tuxes and long gowns the best gangster 's girl saw a large Victrola in the corner of the big living room with its leather couches and grand fireplace the servants spirited away the coffee service and the gangster 's girl put on a record and commanded everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they felt better they did the fox trot and went to the liquor cabinet and broke open some Scotch and gin and they danced and smoked the old man 's cigarettes from the boxes on the tables and the only light came from the big fire and the women danced with one arm dangling holding empty glasses and the gangsters nuzzled their shoulders and their new shoes made slow sibilant rhythms on the polished floors as they danced in their tuxes and gowns of satin at Loon Lake at Loon Lake in the rich man 's camp in the mountains of the Adirondacks.  | He was a whistling wonder with his face and arms and legs in bandages and bandages crisscrossed like bandoliers across his chest . Every now and then they looked in on him with the same separation of themselves from the sight as rubes looking at the freaks . They all wore green . They told him the dog packs were well known in the region , several of them told him that , as if it were a consolation . He had difficulty speaking through his pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly sure what he thought of them and their fucking dogs . The elderly country doctor was eager to see what complication might set in to try him beyond the resources of his medicine . There were pills for the pain but I took as few as I could . It seemed important to me to stay awake , to know what was going on . Maybe I thought the dogs would come back . The room was damp . There was a small window high on the wall . I was in the basement of one of the log buildings I 'd seen and it seemed to me not a very safe place to he . Also it was as had as the original event to dream of it again drugged in a kind of dream prison and struggling for consciousness . Pain was better . It came  | in spasms and with the sharp point of imprinted teeth , it tore along in clawing sweeps down my chest and seemed sometimes to raise the bandages from the skin . I tried to consider it objectively , like a scientist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ahh , peering at each little cellpoint of pain . Remarkable ! And since I was in pain , I thought of my mother and father . I thought of myself bedridden in Paterson . They look at me lying there flushed and wheezing , a boy impossibly exercised just by the act of living , and go off to work at their machines . A man looked in on me each morning and made a grunt of disgust or scorn just like my father had although heavyset not at all like my thin and gaunt father but in the same role , with the same wordless eloquence . He wore a kind of uniform of dark green shirt and matching pants . And for my mother a woman in pale green uniform and white shoes and opaque brown hose with a thick seam down the back . An impassive porky being with hands that worked at high speed setting down trays pounding pillows carrying off urinals while she thought her own thoughts . I could tell that each of them felt badly used to be taking care of some tramp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affront to the natural order which made service to people bearable because they were higher than you , not lower . I responded with a pride of my own which asked for nothing and gave as little indication of need as possible . And I never thanked them for anything . As I felt better I grew contemptuous as if , coming into this province of wealth , I had adopted its customs . Or perhaps it was more serious , perhaps it had been injected in the saliva of the dogs . On the other hand I had only the word of these people that the dogs did n't belong to the owner of this place . And even if they did n't , they certainly ran to his advantage . My rage flared as if it were the last wound to be felt and the slowest to heal . As time went on I understood that I lay in a room of the staff house where perhaps fifteen or twenty people lived who wore the green livery , forest-green for the outdoor workers , the paler shade for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if related . I was alert to find a friend and I did . She was a girl of the pale green set , a young maid in the big house who shyly looked in on me , advancing each time a little farther into the room until finally she showed up in mid-morning one day when everyone else was working . She had seen we were the same age and that was enough . Her name was Libby . She did n't think of not answering any question that occurred to me . This place was called Loon Lake . It was the domain of the same F. W. Bennett of the Bennett Autobody Works . Did I know the name ? He was very rich . He owned thirty thousand acres here and it was just one of his places . He owned the lake itself , the water in the lake , the land under the water and the fish that swam in it . " But not the dogs , " I said . " Oh no , " she said , " those are wild-running , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who own them and ca n't feed them anymore . And then they go off and forage and breed wild and hunt in packs . " " The people ? " " The dogs . All through the mountains it 's like that , not just here . Does it hurt ? " she asked . " It do n't tickle . " A tremor went through her . She held her arms as if she was cold . " Tell me , does your F. W. Bennett have a wife ? " " Oh , sure ! She 's famous . The Mrs. Bennett who wins all the air races . Her picture 's in the papers . Lucinda Bennett ? " " Oh , her , " I said . " The one with the blond hair ? " " No , she 's a brunette . " Libby touched her own hair , which was brunet too . Like all her features it was ordinary . She was possessed of a sort of plain prettiness that caused you to study her and wish this feature or that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . She blushed . She was a simple innocent person , she granted me her own youthful face on the world without knowing who I was or where I came from . In five minutes I had her whole history . 1 icr uncle , one of the groundkecpers , had gotten her the job . She made twelve dollars a week plus room and board . She was fervent iii her grat it tide . Shc spoke in what I could tell was the communal piety of the staff . 1 iow nervously lucky they would have to feel , how clannish in their good fortune exempt in these mountains from an afflicted age . Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Bennett came or went separately or together or had guests or did n't , but the place was maintained all year round including the dead of winter . " Do n't you get lonely up here ? " I said . She thought a long time . " Well , I send six dollars to my father in Albany . " Not realizing this was enough for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind for justification . " You 'd be surprised who comes here , " she said . She brightened " You get to see famous people . " " Who ?

" " Oh well , I never saw him , it was before I came . But Charlie Chaplin . " " Sure , " I said . " On roller skates . " She looked then suddenly frightened . Who would doubt her word ? She turned and left the room , and I thought to myself well that 's that . But a short while later she returned , softly closing the door behind her . She held a large leatherbound book to her chest and looked at me over the gilt edge with bright excited eyes . " I better not get caught , " she said . It was the Loon Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull myself up and she sat on the side of the bed and opened the book to a page marked " 1931 . " Her index finger ran down a list of signatures and stopped and she turned her eyes on me as I saw whose signature it was : Charles Chaplin had made an elegant scrawl , and next to it , where there was a space for comment , he had written : " Splendid weekend ! Gay company ! " Vindicated , Libby watched with pleasure as I became absorbed by all the nams , right up to the present : signatures of movie stars , orchestra leaders , authors , senators , all famous enough to be recognized by me , but also signatures I recognized only vaguely , or only sensed as names of magnitude , like the name F. W. Bennett , names that had been given to things , names painted on the big signs over factories or carved in the stone  |  |  | over the entrances of office buildings .

If only I could understand the significance of the notations , I 'd have what I needed I 'd know what I 'd always dreamed of knowing  --  although I could n't have said what it was . I touched the signatures , traced them trying to feel the ink . It was some mysterious system of legalities and caste and extended brilliant endeavor  --  all abbreviated into these names and dates of proud people from all over the world who had come here to this secret place in the mountains . I became aware of this girl Libby in her pale green uniform . She sat very close to me , the starched front of her uniform rose and fell with her breathing . When I glanced up from the book I found her face near mine , her head bowed and her eyes on the page , but her consciousness all directed to me . Her full lower lip was impressed into a suggestion of voluptuousness by her front teeth . She had thick wavy hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of it , or so I understood ? the willingness of the others of us to find a place and live our lives within it , making our trembling alliances and becoming famous and powerful to each other .

I said to Libby , " Hey , how long have I been here , anyway ? " " We were taking off the summer covers and putting the rugs down , " she said . " It was that night . I never hope to hear what I heard that night . " " Well , when was it , please ? " " Two weeks ago . " " Was n't someone here then ? Did n't you have visitors ?

" Well , how come I do n't see anything that recent in the guest hook ? " She was silent a long while . I knew I was extending her loyalty . I gazed  | at her and waited for my answer . She looked discouraged . " Not just anyone gets to sign , " she said finally . " Is that right ? " I said . She would n't look at me now . " I think someone 's calling you , Libby . " " Where ? " She went to the door , opened it and listened . I leaned over with a painful lunge to the bedside stand . In the little drawer was a fountain pen . I unscrewed the cap , shook a blot on the floor , spread open the guest book and signed my name with a flourish . " What are you doing ! " Libby said . Her hand was on her cheek and she stared at me in horror . " Joe , " I wrote . " Of Paterson . Splendid dogs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By signing the guest book , did I mean to be going on my way ? I felt the pretense , as well as any other , washed away in a wave of weakness and despair . The girl grabbed the book and ran . She had a friend , as it turned out , a man who lived on the grounds as a kind of permanent houseguest . He came to look at me later that day , peering in the door with an expression of wonder very odd in a full-grown middle-aged adult . He was a large heavy man . He was bearded . His hair was overgrown and unkempt . His eyes were blue and set in a field of pink that suggested a history of torments and conflicts past ordinary understanding . His weight and size seemed to amplify the act of breathing , which took place through his mouth . His nose looked swollen , a web of fine purple lines ran up his cheeks from the undergrowth , and all the ravage together told of the drinker . He said his name was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He padded around the room in a pair of old tennis sneakers . He wore baggy trousers belted below his stomach , and an ancient tweed jacket with patches at the elbow . Beneath the jacket was what seemed to be a soft graying tennis shirt part of the collar folded under he did n't seem to be aware of this .  | " I can understand your feeling better than you can , young man . I spend my life understanding feelings , yes , my own and others , that 's what I do , that 's what poets do , that 's what they 're supposed to do . " " You 're a poet ? " " I 'm the poet in residence here , " he said , drawing himself up slightly trying to tuck his shirt in glancing then at me from the corner of his eye . I thought I would never know the end of the subtle luxuries with which the wealthy provided themselves . " So I can understand your feelings . But I also understand poor Libby 's , good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , and now she 's in fear for her job . Do you realize what it would mean for her to lose her job ? Of course I 'll do what I can , the Bennetts are n't here right now , fortunately , I 'll think of something , yes , I 'll speak to Lucinda , I suppose I can , but that 's not the point . You should have realized the girl was responsible for anything you did . She was nice to you , she made you her friend , she shared something she knew , and that 's how you repaid her . " I liked him enormously . I was smiling I was admitted into his realm of moral concern without passport credentials references of any sort . There I was a hobo boy lying on this cot in this weird place suppurating , for all he knew , in my dereliction , not a pot to pee in , and he was trying to recall me to my honor . He assumed I had it ! He saw me smiling and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course it was wicked , a good wicked joke , God knows I can enjoy a joke at his expense . I wish there were more of them . Incidentally , he himself is not totally devoid of humor , you know . " " Who ? " " Bennett . I 've studied him a long time . He 's a very capable human being . Quite charming at times . The mistake most people make is to jump to conclusions before they even meet him . " " Well , I 'll try not to , " I said and we laughed again . At that moment my mother-keeper came in , took my tray , gave Penfield a dirty look , and left . " Dreadful woman , " he said . " They all are . Except for I , ihby , of course . They despise me . I 'm more than they are but I have no place as they have . They play all sorts of tricks on me , I have to heg for my meals . But when  | the Bennetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm served like I 'm the king of England . " I saw that he suffered from this , as from everything , in a state of expressive self-magnifying complaint . " Well , I suppose I should go . How do you feel , by the way ? " " Lousy . " He pulled up his jacket sleeve and showed me on the inside of his left arm a pale scar from the wrist to the elbow . " You 're not the only one , I want you to know . They treed me seven years ago when I came here one night  --  just like you . "  | Qe morning on his bed at the foot a folded suit of dark green . He dressed in it and looked for the first time into the hallway outside the room where he had been since he was carried there on some door was a mirror and there he was thin pale-faced boy pale as a sheet , with a sparse stubble on the rim of the jaw , a head of uncombed hair looking too big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still flinching from the teeth , from the snarling face of the mountainous night . Something has leaked out through the stitches and some of the serious intention of the world has leaked in : like the sense of high stakes , the desolate chance of real destiny . There was a distant railroad track with telephone poles regularly spaced down the side of my neck over the clavicle across the breastbone . There was another spur line on either arm and the right leg . I had no feeling in the fourth finger of my right hand . Thus I found myself on a brilliant morning raking leaves in the shadow of the great sprawling lodge house of the auto magnate 14 ' . W. I3cnnett.  | I was not to consider myself employed , however . My Loon Lake parents would as frankly have sent me on my way but they did nothing without the approval of their employer , who was still to return . I felt weak in the knees , I could n't have gone anywhere anyway . I was glad to hold on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land side , three on the lake side ? the land dropped precipitously from the crest of the hill  --  and its walls were logs , uniformly brown , set with casement windows and crowned with a wood shingle roof of many angles and regularly spaced dormers . The trees oak maple elm , and though it was still September , a heavy leaf fall everywhere behind the meadow of my encounter , a burning wood of orange and gold and behind this on a distant mountain , ageless stands of evergreen against the bright blue sky . As the morning advanced the sun was warm on my back . The air was sweet . I felt better . I was one of three or four workmen . A small truck with slat sides moved slowly among us to receive our leaves . We moved around to the back of the house and swept the leaves from two terraces , the upper with tables and chairs for dining , the lower with cushioned wooden wheeled lounge chairs for the view and the sun . The lake out there a definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its east and west shores hidden from view by intervening hills , its south shore across the water filled with pine and spruce that rose up straight on the mountainside in a kind of terror . The lake glittered with fragments of sun , and flying over it were a couple of large black-and-white loons , big as swans . There was a boathouse down at the water in the same style as the main house . A dock going around the boathouse . A swimming float fifty yards out . Between the terraces and the water line was a steep hillside garden of wild things , and through its paths we raked away the unwanted leaves from the bushes and plants . I looked back up the hill to the house and felt the imposition of an enormous will on the natural planet . Stillness and peace , not the sound of a car or a horn or even a human voice , and I felt boon Lake in its isolation , the bought wilderness , and speculated what I would do if I had  | the money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was that what money was for , to put a distance of fifty thousand acres of mountain terrain between you and the boondocks of the world ? The man made automobile bodies , and they were for connection , cars were democracy we had been told . The wind rose in a sudden gust about my ears , and as I looked back to the lake , a loon was coming in like a roller coaster . He hit he water and skidded for thirty yards , sending up a great spray , and when the water settled he was gone . I could n't see him , I thought the fucker had drowned . But up he popped , shaking and mauling a fat fish . And when the fish was polished off , I heard a weird maniac cry coming off the water , and echoing off the hills . A while later I followed the workers going along the hillside with their rakes through the trees past the stables to the staff house for lunch . The people of the light and dark green ate in a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The food was put out on compartmented metal trays as in a cafeteria . Fifteen , twenty of them looking at me as I hesitated with my tray and then slid into a place next to Libby , who smiled and looked with some satisfaction to the rest of the table . I was inspected by a heavyset man with thick black eyebrows I took to be the uncle she had mentioned . I gave back a clear-eyed friendly face do n't worry I 'm no threat not me . After that I was ignored . I studied them all covertly : there were two , possibly three families of Bennett servants here . They did not make conversation . I had a palpable feeling of the politics of the place , the suspicious credential I had as a victim of the dogs . It was n't enough to crack their guild . They seemed confident of that . Well , screw them , they could n't even understand that I wanted no part of it . When I was strong enough , a day or two , I 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them to work out why . I still had the dollars I 'd come with , stained brown with my blood but no less negotiable . Nobody here , not even Libby , knew my full name or had asked where I came from or where I 'd been going . The force of self-distinguishing which I found so foolish among stiffs  | and hobos was what I ran on . When you are nobody and have nothing , you depend on your troubles for self-respect . I had paid heavily for the bed and board . I was n't one of them , I was a paying guest . I finished and walked out while they were still drinking their coffee . I 'd be damned if I 'd lift a rake or anything else . What could they do , fire me ? I stood on the porch and thought about leaving right away , immediately . And it was at this moment that I saw over the rise to the meadow two people on the tennis court  --  one of them a girl with blond hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed in expectation by the agonized heave of my heart . Mr. Penfield the resident poet , an absurd roundish figure in white shorts and a shirt stretched dangerously by an enormous belly , was showing from his side of the net the proper form of the forehand . Once twice three times he stroked the air . His lithe student , trim in a tennis dress , watched him while holding her racquet on her shoulder . Penfield now hit a ball to her . Careless of all his advice , she swung at it with a great wild lunge and poled it far over the fence across the meadow . I saw tennis balls lying like white flowers everywhere . He reached into a round basket for another ball and hit it gently , and again she took a furious swing and the ball flew over the fence . Once more he hit to her and she spun herself around missing the ball entirely . He said something to her . She glared at him , dropped the racquet and left the court . She strode across the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpinned her hair fluffing it to the breeze ignoring him as he stood on the court and called after her in a voice half reproach half apology , " Clara ! Clara ! " But she went over the crest of a slope and descended by degrees until only her head could be seen moving toward the house . Mr. Penfield hurriedly collected the tennis balls lying about the court . I did the same thing in the grass . We met at the court gate . His large bleary face gazed upon mine . " She ca n't hear to he taught , " he said , admitting me with a stunning lack of cerenuny to his thoughts . " All I said was " Fake a level swing , do n't  | worry about hitting hard . ' " He looked again in the direction she had gone . He smiled . " But what game can it be , after all , in which one does n't hit one 's hardest ! " He thrust into my hands the racquet and pail of balls and hurried off after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that ability of some fat people to be quick and graceful . I stepped onto the court and picked up her racquet . I took everything to the shack not even thinking of it as the site of my grisly misfortune . I had forgotten misfortune . I headed back to the staff house , from one moment to the next , a worried probationary in my dark green shirt and pants no thought further from my mind than leaving . I wanted a job ! Their job ! Just as they knew I did . I would take up the rake or any other tool they had in mind oh God it was Clara , that was her name , Clara the girl on the train , no question about it , twice now the sight of her had stopped my heart .  | did n't know what would happen in my life but I knew whatever it was it would have to do with her , with Clara . I thought even having her name was an enormous inroad of intelligence . Was she a Bennett ? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained to their tennis and their riding ? This one , so blazingly beautiful and pissed-off , knew nothing , this one standing pigeon-toed and swinging stiff-armed at balls so incredibly breath-takingly awkward and untrained  --  no , she was not a relation . Was she a guest ? If so , where were the others , she had come with a train , maids in waiting ! an entourage ! but they were nowhere about , only the resident poet Penfield ambled after her like her pet bear . Was she related to Penfield ? I would do anything be anything to know her and know about her . Dressed in dark green , a spy ! I worked to show them how worthy I was , how useful , to show them how I admired what they were and how I wanted to be like them and one of them . How much time did I have ? Only until the big rnan arrived , I had only that time to prove I should n't be thrown out on my ass .  | Of course I could n't express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ princess living on the grounds . But she had loved showing me the guest book and I thought from her same peasant identification with Bennett wealth she would enjoy the wonder on my face as she secretly showed me the main house , where they lived and had their lives and Charlie Chaplin and the one-named kings sat down to dinner . The Bennetts not at home there was a bending of the rules : on Saturday night two Loon Lake station wagons pulled out leaving a skeleton staff . On Sunday afternoon with the sun coming through the trees at low angles to light the rooms , through rectangles of sun along dark corridors , Libby and I tiptoed about the vast upstairs with its hall alcoves of casement windows and window seats and bookshelves and its suites of rooms , each with its generous shade porch , and Adirondacks chairs and sofas . Whatever empty room I saw led my mind to the next room , the next turn in the corridor , everywhere the light off the lake cast its silvery shimmer on the walls or in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed off . " We ca n't go there , " Libby said . " Why not ? " I asked , casual as I could be . " It 's the Bennetts ' wing , where they stay . " " Is someone there ? " " No . But I would n't feel right about it . Rose and Mary take care of it , " she said . She led me down a back stair through a kitchen with two black steel ranges and pantries of provisions and several iceboxes each crowned with its humming cylindrical motor . Through a room of glass cabinets filled with sets of china and drawers of silver service . Through the hexagonal dining room , three walls of glass and a table hexagonal in shape to seat thirty people . To the huge living room , the grandest room of all , with tan leather couches built into the walls , the walls hung with the heads of trophy . There were two different levels of game tables and racks of magazines and clusters of stuffed chairs all looking out enormous windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of intrusion , my chest constricted ? and something else  --  the thinnest possibility of destructive intent ,  | some very fine denial on my part to submit to awe . " Of course this is just one of their places , " Libby said . " Can you imagine ? " One or two steps up and we were in the entrance hall . The walls were of dark rough wood . We stood under a chandelier made from antlers . I gazed up a wide curved staircase of halved logs polished to a high shine , with balusters of saplings . I gazed at this as at the gnarled and swirling access to a kingdom of trolls . " Do n't you love roughing it ? " I said to Libby , running her up the staircase . " What ! " she cried , but laughing too , entirely subject to my mood . In the long upstairs corridor I placed her hand on my arm and strolled with her as if we were master and mistress . I led her into one of the suites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I extended my arm and said , " Let us enjoy the view that God in his wisdom has arranged for us , my deah . " She swept past me giggling in the game and we stood in the sun side by side looking over the kingdom . " Do you mind if I smoke , old girl ? " I said in my best imitation of wealthy speech . " No ? Why , thank you , I think I 'll light up one of these monogrammed cigs with my initials on them . " She was animated with pleasure , how easily she could be made to live ! I kissed her to show her how the wealthy kissed , their noses so high in the air that their lips never met , only their chins . Then of course I kissed her properly . She was confused , she drew back blushing , she had thought it her secret that she was sweet on me . Whatever I wanted from poor Libby I could n't explain what I was doing solely to gain it . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For those few minutes the upstairs maid and the hobo boy were the Bennetts of Loon Lake . Libby took my hand and showed me a storage room where F. W. Bennett kept his stock of outfits that he provided his guests as gifts : riding habits and hoots , tennis flannels , bathing suits , a goddamn haberdashery . I stood in front of a full-length mirror and took off my greens and put on a pair of tan tweed knickers with pleats , ribbed socks , brown-and-white saddle shoes , my size , a soft white shirt , and a white sweater with an argyle design of large gold and brown diamonds across my chest . I was stunned by the magnificent youth that looked hack at me from  | the mirror . All the scars and deeper marks of hard life were covered in fine fashion . The face , a bit gaunt but unlined , the hair I combed back hastily with my fingers . He made a passing aristocrat ! Well , I thought , so a lot of the effect comes from the outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son ! And then I felt again my child 's pretense that those two gray sticks in Paterson were not really my parents but my kidnappers ! Who knew whose child I was ! I dreamed of recognition from her from Clara . It was her nearness that made me so crazy , and bold with Libby . So feverish so happy . And as for Bennett I thought , He is no more aware of me than of some unfortunate prowler mauled by the wild dogs . But here I am , wearing his clothes , wandering freely through his house . Here I am , Mr. Muck-amuck , and you do n't even know it ! Then Libby came back from the female supply store and she was wearing jodhpurs and a silk blouse and a riding helmet perched none too securely on her thick hair and she wobbled in a pair of shiny boots too wide in the shank for her thin legs . " You look swell , Libby , " I said . She turned around with little shaky steps and gave me all the dimensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tremulous overbitten smile . I danced her out of there down the corridor doing a fast fox trot full of swirls while I hummed the tune I had heard the night I came , " Exactly Like You , " Libby laughing and worrying at the same time , telling me to hush , looking back over her shoulder , giggling , falling against me every other step , brushing my cheek with her lips . And the light lay like a track along the carpet and shone in golden stations of the open doors .  | here being no sign of her in the main house I knew she was staying in the smaller lodge perhaps a hundred yards west , into the woods and halfway down the hill to the lake . I think I must have spent some while calculating how to get there , figuring out a pretext and then a script for the conversation we would have . But one evening , during the staff meal , one of the woodfolk , a grandmotherly one , said to me , " That Penfield called . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who , me ? What for ? " " How should I know ? " she said . " I 'll be glad when you 're gone and them with you . " I finished my meal as slowly as I could , feigning the attitude of the workingmen of dark green . I washed my tray and lit a cigarette and sauntered hack to my room . I latched the door and changed from my work clothes to the knickers and shirt and sweater and ribbed socks and saddle shoes . Poor Libby , all happiness drained like the color in her face when I told her I was keeping  | these things . Should n't she have known that the fellow who 'd write in the guest book would do that ? Anyway , she understood the firm basis of our relationship , that whatever trust she placed in me I would betray . And as for Mr. Penfield I knew in my bones I did n't have anything to fear from him . He had a way of canceling himself out if you let him talk long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got out of the staff house without being seen . Already dark on the path , the first stars coming out . Joe drew a sharp breath and tried to calm himself . He was trembling . He had followed her , navigating by her star , and by that means had been sleeping in a bed and eating well and indulging his self-regard for several weeks . An edited view but fervently held . In his mind , his feelings were enough . He did n't need intentions , plans , the specificity of hope . Presenting his heart was enough . " Here he is  --  and look at him ! " Penfield said at the door . He held a bottle of red wine in one hand and a glass in the other . " Come in , come in ! " It was a low-ceilinged cottage with a living room and kitchen and stone hearth all in one . I tried not to look at her she was sitting on the sofa Indian style wearing a robe of white satiny material and it had fallen open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not looking at me but taking a mighty pull from her wineglass head up neck beautiful pulsing neck . " Here he is , Clara  --  Joe of Paterson , the man I wanted you to meet . " A glass was put in my hand . " Miss Clara Lukaes , " he said . Pointing me at a chair , he crossed his ankles and sank his bulk down on the floor at her feet . They were both facing me and to my right and their left a fire was going in the fireplace . The light flared and dimmed on their faces as some kind of wavering attention , I thought , especially from her she had not asked to meet me how absurd to have thought that . I sensed some purpose not entirely complimentary itt the summons . Yet Penfield was smiling amiably indicating to Inc to drink and so I did , with the odd conviction that I had  | never tasted wine before . I had ridden the cars with the bums of three states worked with freaks and was wicked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shone . What was the conversation ? Mostly his , of course , the brilliant singsong of the failed poet , but how could I have been listening with the attention such beautiful words demanded , people from my world did n't talk with such embellishment such scrollwork . I had never before met someone who admitted to the profession of poet but believed it by the way he spoke . I kept my eyes on his face but it was her I looked at , this restless cat of inattention sitting quite still and staring into her wine careless of exposed limbs the inner thigh the rounded knee small cream cracked hummock of the underknees she sat quite still but her mind pacing from one wall to another , an expression on her small fair face of grief or petulance I could n't tell . But how she felt was of overriding importance to me , how she felt ! ? then and every moment after  --  was my foremost concern , what I lived by . This was her quality and I think she was unconscious of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was surprisingly small , a small-boned slight thing with narrow shoulders . There was nothing stately about her except the alarming size of her moods . I studied her face with a fervent rush of recognition , a fair skin with a rouge of chapped cheeks , quick green eyes prominent upper lip everything framed in marcelled bleached blond hair I had friends playing as a child with such faces in Paterson I heard the fluent yowl of injustice from this face . Mr. Penfield speaking of injustice explained how much more modest were his own rooms over the stables than this full cottage in the rustic log style . On the other hand he wrote well there he said in his way of negating his every point of view by obliging himself to express its opposite . Then he recites some lines about the place , about Loon Lake . The glass in one hand , the bottle in the other , he sits with legs outstretched he is in his dirty sneakers with no socks his tweed jacket with the elbow patches his tennis shirt with the soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep melodious voice for his lines not his normal voice I was embarrassed by this sudden access to performance but she was not . She paid attention  | to his poetry as she had not to his conversation . But no audience was as responsive to Mr. Penfield 's words as he was . His red eyes grew large with a film of tears . I augment my memory with the lines actually printed in a private edition , the last of his three privately published volumes all recording different times of his life in the different places the same person . " The loons they heard were the loons we hear today " ? in his deep reader 's chant ? " cries to distract the dying loons diving into the cold black lake and diving back out again in a whorl of clinging water clinging like importuning spirits fingers shattering in spray feeling up the wing along the rounded body of the thrillingly exerting loon beaking a fish rising to the moon streamlined its loon eyes round and red . " And I , resonantly attuned to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at great cost , with the scars to show it , from such profound effort , the kind of unceasing insistence on my life 's rights that was only now so exhausting in my release from it . As this absurd fat drunkard sang his words they seemed the most beautiful I had ever heard . But perhaps any words would have done . I heard them and I did n't hear them , I had no idea he had just written them I thought they were from some book already done , I heard the feeling they inspired in me , that I was living at last ! That it was the way it should be , I was feeling Penfield 's immense careless generosity , the boon of himself which granted me without argument everything I was struggling for , all of it assumed in the simple giving of words , so moving to this scruffy boy . It was the moment of dangerous specification of everything I thought worth wanting . After the loon flew off whose red eyes were much like his own he cleared his throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sipped mine . He emptied the bottle on his turn and struggled to his feet for another bottle which he uncorked while continuing to speak and again he sat down with the new bottle as attached to his hand as the old . I tried not to look at her . I saw the glance from under her brows toward the ceiling , the impatience , and then I began to feel the force of the occasion which was that somehow I was enlisted to help divert , distract  | or pacify Clara LukaCs . That was the meaning of the self-dramatization of the man , that we were in some overburdened instant , with our backs to it , grounding our heels , digging in . And then he was telling us about the war , of all things , a veteran , migod , would he bring out the poppies ? But soon we were inside his images , listening like children , the mule-drawn caissons sinking in the mud , the troops in greatcoats and tin helmets riding the mules ' backs , kicking their boots sharply against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-foot wheels , spokes like baseball bats tires of steel , each soldier alone and miserable inside his coat , charred trees beside the road the sky showing through city hall , gusts of acrid air blowing from the front , and here is Corporal Penfield riding the signal wagon , flag tubes strapped to his back like quivers , a helmet tilting over his eyes because the strap is too loose , and on his lap the crate covered with a khaki blanket shifts perceptibly , the pigeons whirring with each dull boom lighting the sky like lightning miles ahead . He was dangling a medal . He had taken it from his pocket . He handed it to me . The colors of the ribbon had bled , there was thread and lint attached to it , but it was a Silver Star and it was his . I leaned forward put it in her hand leaning forward over the bear rug between us , our hands grazed I felt the heat of her hand . And there in our minds as we looked at the palpable proof was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgently to semaphore the artillery to drop some heavy stuff on the encircling Huns . " The field telephone did n't work , there was n't even a damn pigeon left . " He paused to wet his throat . " So I took the old semaphore flags and went up to the top of a hill where I could be seen , because even though it was night the star shells were like the Fourth of July and it was brighter than day . I could see out over no man 's land . I sent my message " ? here he lifted his arms , attached to the glass and bottle and did a half-hearted pantomime ? " and a while later the artillery came in on target , and that 's what I got the medal for . " " You 're a hero , " she said , smiling . She dropped the medal in his lap and then raised her glass to her lips . " No , but , love , you have n't heard the end . " 1 Ie dropped his chin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't send the message I was supposed to . What I semaphored was the first verse of a poem . " " What ? " I said . " There was a time when meadow , grove , and stream , The earth , and every common sight , To me did seem Apparelled in celestial light , The glory and the freshness of a dream , ' and so on , " he said . " And a while later the shells came in on target . It was very strange . " She was laughing . " In the war  --  in the battle ? " " Surely you know it , " he said . " The Intimations Ode ? Did n't you have it in school ? " " But why ? " " I do n't know why . Maybe I thought I was going to die . Maybe it seemed to me the only appropriate thing to say . Anyway , after I got the medal I wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Army returning it and telling him it was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a medal for poetry , " I said , and immediately felt like a fool . " Apparently not , Joe of Paterson . Apparently not . I had to go for psychiatric tests . They pinned the medal on my bathrobe . They kept me under observation for ninety days in Nutley , New Jersey . " " Where ? " she said , happily laughing . He looked up at her , victorious in her amusement . " Oh , Warren , you old fuck , where ? " She threw back her head and laughed and laughed , I gazed at her throat , her neck , it was a moment in which I could look at all of her as she sat in her white satin robe , she bending forward now in her laughter , the robe unfolding like unfolding wings so that I could see her breasts . Then I realized Penfield was looking at me , with his head lowered , with raised eyebrows , a characteristic expression , I knew at once , full of sadness , full of self-acknowledgment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to giggle , he was in love with her , and soon they were both laughing and I was laughing , but trying not to for some reason , feeling badly that I laughed , feeling ashamed . I had n't realized how drunk they were . A few moments later , in silence , she put her glass down and reached out , holding his head in her arms . 1 he looked up at her , and behind her shingle of hair he kissed her , his hand  | with the bottle going up involuntarily , another semaphore , and I heard her sob , and then both of them were crying . I tried to leave , but they would n't allow it . All at once they were very physical with me , placing themselves on either side of me and leading me back to the middle of the room . Penfield went to stoke up the fire . She led me to my chair and pressed my shoulders firmly with her small hands and then sat across from me and studied me solemnly . Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had not quite acknowledged me , as if one person at a time , and only one , could occupy her mind . She was always to be this way , intense and direct with whatever she fixed upon , and whatever the affront to those on the periphery . It was not snobbishness or anything like that  --  she was in fact reckless of her selfinterest in a situation , and that I think was the center of her force and effect . She knew nothing about courtesy in the sense of not being subject to it . She blazed through her feelings and suffered the consequences . I began to realize as we talked that she was no older than I was . I was stunned  --  I was not yet twenty  --  I equated power and position in the world with age . " You live here ? " she said . " How do you stand it ? " I rubbed my palms on my knickers . I looked with alarm at Warren Penfield , who said , " Clara , he 's my surprise for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor . She had a throaty voice with a scratched quality . Her diction was of the street . " Whats ' at mean ! " She gazed at me , her eyes widening , and I was certain , as if a chasm were opening around me , that she was as fraudulent in this place as I was . I drank off my wine . " You remember the night you heard the dogs ? " the poet said to her , and leaned forward to refill my glass . " Joe here is taking each day as it comes  --  like you , Clara . " I saw realization light her eyes . She went to the fire and sat down before it with her hack to us . I do n't remember much of what happened after that . I drank more than I should have . The fire looming her shadow across the low-ceilinged room . Later we heard the rain falling , a heavy rain that seemed to do something to the draught . Wood smoke came into the room  | on gusts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed my shirt , and she was tracing the scars on my chest and arms and neck with her fingertips . I could smell her , the soap she used , the gel of her hair . The firelight flared on our faces as if we were standing with the poet in his war . " He told me it was a deer , that they took a deer , " she said . " That was a lie . " " Yes , " Penfield said , watching her fingers . " What class , " Clara said . Tears were suddenly coming down her cheeks . " I could help you leave , " Penfield said . His eyes closed and he began moving his head from side to side like someone in mourning .

I heard a man 's voice , a quiet word of encouragement , and then she , on her lighter mount , passed my eyes , the boot not quite secure in the stirrup . I ran to the doors and put my eyes to the crack : the back and head of white hair were all I could see of Bennett before Clara 's figure loomed up on her fat-assed horse , she did n't roll with its footfalls but took each one bumping , her black riding helmet slightly askew And then horses and riders passed behind some trees and were gone .  | I raked shit .

Beans are picked from the gardens , plump fowl slaughtered , and in castles above the road unemployed warriors duel the firelight . They weep they curse they raise wine cups to honor . Saints of the wrong religion go unrecognized in the darkness beyond the lighted windows of the inns . And at the end of the Tokaido at the top of an inaccessible mountain sits the emperor himself , a self-imperator , a self impersonating a self in splendor in his empty room its walls painted with long-legged waterbirds , its floor covered with ministers lying face down attending him .

Each of his representations of himself at the critical moments of this past contributed to the finished man before me . He proved everything by his self-deprecation , his sighs , his lachrymose pauses , his prodigious thirst for wine , and he proved it in the scene or two with Clara , when , at an hour he somehow always knew , he would get me to help him over to her cottage not five minutes since she had come in herself , her make-up and hair and dress all showing the use of the evening , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penfield was the idea of rescue .

" " Oh God , " he 'd cry , lifting his eyes , " oh God who made this girl , give her to me this time to hold , let me sink into the complacencies of fulfilled love , let us lose our memories together and let me die from the ordinary insubstantial results of having lived ! " " Goddamnit , " Clara shouted , and then , appealing to me , the audience , a role I embraced as I would any she chose , " what does he want from me ? Oh Jesus !

I supposed it was midnight . No light on . It did n't matter . I sat in the shadow of her porch and I folded my arms and waited . A strong wind blowing over the mountains and sounding in the trees around the cottage . The trunks of the pine trees swayed and creaked . I sat with my back to the door and drew up my knees . I might be hearing her in her rut , singing somewhere with the wind going past an open window . That was all right . That was all right . If the poet could have her on her terms and the rich man on his , I could have her on mine . My revelation . Maybe she traveled like a princess on a private train , maybe poets thought they recognized her , but I knew her accent , she was an Eastern industrial child , she had come off streets like my streets she was born of the infinite class of nameless workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed against girls like her in the hallways , I had bent them backward on the banister , I had pulled their hair I had lifted their skirts I had rubbed them till they creamed through their underpants . I reached over my head and tried the doorknob . Open . I decided to wait  | for her in comfort . I turned on a light . The wood smoke lay under the low ceiling . The hearth was cold . I put in some paper and kindling and got a fire going and stood with my back to the fire . The green livery had as little regard for her as they did for Penfield . The place was a mess . I saw traces of our first party . Dirty dishes in the little alcove kitchen . Not that she 'd care . I looked in her bedroom . Her clothes everywhere , stockings twisted and curled like strips of bacon , step-ins in two perfect circles on the floor as if disengaged in a meditative moment , or flung across a lampshade as if drop-kicked . Poor Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I knew what made his sympathies obsolete . Clara and Bennett had had breakfast together on the morning after he arrived . I managed to be raking leaves at the foot of the terrace wall under their line of sight . It was a bright windy morning and the clouds actually were below us over the lake and drifting through the trees on the mountains . " I think clouds should stay in the sky where they belong , " Clara said , " do n't you ? " And Bennett had laughed . Clara held a relentless view of the world . There were no visible principles . Every one of her moods and feelings was intense and true to itself ? if not to the one before or the one after . She lightened and darkened like the times of the day . I smoked a cigarette from the monogrammed cigarette box . Clearly , in my aspiration it was FWB I would have to contend with . FWB , the man who was paying for everything . Conceivably this gave him an advantage . I mashed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire , put my hands under my head and closed my eyes . I slept in that position for several hours . I remember coming awake with the fire out and sunlight glowing on the windows . The silhouettes of branches and leaves wavered on the log wall and a reddish gold light filled the room . I heard the sound of an airplane . It grew louder and then with a rise in pitch it receded and grew faint . I lay there and it got louder again and finally so close and thunderous that the cups rattled in the sink . Then the sound receded once more , the pitch of the engine rising . I went to the window : a single-engine plane with pont(x)ns was banking over the mountain on the other sick of the lake I watched it , a seaplane with a  | cowled engine and an overhead wing . As it banked , its dimensions flared and I saw a smartly painted green-and-white craft zooming over the water and then lifting its nose and banking off again , the sun flashing on its wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was coming around . I ran outside . I watched several runs , each one was different in speed or angle of descent , it looked as if the pilot was practicing or doing tests . You did n't often see airplanes this close . And then as the show continued here was Clara LukaEs coming through the woods from the main house . She wore a white evening gown . She carried her shoes in her hand . She peered up through the trees , she turned , she walked backward , she stopped , she stood on her toes . She moved through patches of light and shade , and reaching the little clearing in front of the cabin , she took me in with a glance and turned to see the plane in its run . It was very low this time . It drifted down the length of the lake and then dropped below the tree line . " Are you here ? " Clara said . She passed into the house and I followed . She stood in the middle of the room with her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes , she flung them away . At this moment the phone rang . It was in the bedroom and she ran in as if she was going to attack it . " What ! " I heard her shout by way of greeting . A pause . " Yeah , well , I would n't count on it ! " she said and slammed the phone down . I waited a minute . When she did n't come out , I moved to the doorway . She was sitting on the edge of her bed in some distraction slipping off one shoulder strap , then the other , shrugging her gown to her waist . Losing all volition , she dropped her hands in her lap and sat hunched over without glamour or grace . Her hair was matted and tears streamed down her cheeks . She had no degrees of response , she lived hard , and the effect of her crying on my heart was calamitous . Her eyes were swollen almost immediately , her breasts were wet with her tears . Her looks collapsed as if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Come on . Come on . " After a wink she staxl up and let the gown fall to her ankles . She had  | nothing on underneath . She was big-breasted for such a thin narrowshouldered girl . She stepped out of the gown and went into the bathroom and a moment later I heard the shower running . Her behind was small and firm , if a bit on the flat side . The prominence of her backbone made me smile . It made me think of the scrawny backs on sunburned little girls who came to the carnival in their bathing suits and convened at the cotton candy . While she showered I found a percolator and put up some coffee . She came out wrapped in a white bath towel with a big maroon FWB monogrammed on the front . She accepted a mug of coffee and sat on the couch with her legs folded under her and held the mug with both hands as if for warmth . She had washed her hair , which lay about her head in wet curls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes glistening and as she looked at me I wondered how I could have found anything to criticize . I had never in my life seen a woman more beautiful . " This place is getting on my nerves , " she said . " How do I get out of here ? " " I 'll take care of it , leave it to me , " I said without a moment 's hesitation . Without a moment 's hesitation . She glanced at me as she sipped her coffee . I waited for my justice . I wondered if I had taken her too literally if she would laugh now crack my heart with her laughter . But she said nothing and seemed satisfied enough by my assurance . Sun filled the room . She put her cup on the floor and curled up on the sofa with her back to me . Drops of water glittered in her hair . After a while I realized she had gone to sleep . I ran out of there determined not to be amazed . I should concentrate on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me back . I wanted to sing , I was exhilarated to madness . But the way to bring this off was to think of my brazen hopes as reasonable and myself as a calm practical person matter-of-factly making a life for himself that was no more than he deserved .  | hen Bennett himself was suddenly in full force in my life like a storm that had arrived . I found myself that same morning with three or four of the groundkeepers , each of us with a pick or shovel on our shoulders , we were hurrying to a site in the woods off the main bridle path . Bennett was waiting . He was standing on a hill of some sort . His horse was tethered to a tree along the trail . " Come up here , " he called . We climbed up the face of an enormous boulder imbedded in the ground . " I 've always wondered about this , " he said . " I want it exposed . " The foreman of us , an older man long in the Bennett service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You want us to dig this rock up ? " he asked . " Dig around it , " Bennett said . " You see here ? This is the top of it , we 're standing on top of it . That 's what this rise is . I want the whole thing uncovered , I do n't know why it 's here . " The workmen had trouble believing what he wanted . Bennett did n't get quad . Instead , lie took one of the picks and started going at it himself .  | " You see ? " he called out , breathing hard between swings of the pick . " Work it away , like this . You see that , how it extends ? Goes all the way over here . " " Here , Mr. Bennett , " the foreman said . " Do n't you be doing that . You , you , " he said to us . " Get to work . " So we started digging out a boulder that might be the size of a dirigible . Bennett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's the way , " he said . " That 's what I want . " He was sturdy and vigorous . Moved around a lot . A short wide-shouldered man with a large head . His hair was white but very full and combed as I combed mine , to a pompadour . He was well tanned . Blue eyes . A handsome blunt-faced old bastard in a riding outfit . I had expected someone older , more restrained . He climbed down off the rise and for several minutes crashed around in the woods nearby to see if he could find another rock like it . " You see , " he shouted , " it 's the only one . " Damnedest thing ! " he called out as if we were all colleagues on some archaeological expedition . Then he mounted his horse and rode off in the direction of the stables . As soon as he was out of sight the foreman leaned on his shovel , took off his cap and wiped his forehead with the back of his hand . " Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down on the boulder . But a while later two more diggers came along flushed from their dens , and soon there were a half-dozen of us standing shirtless in the woods swinging our picks and shovels at this mountainous stone . It was interesting to me how the impulse of the man transformed into the hard work of the rest of us . By our digging we suggested something really important was going on , someone passing by would look at us and think it was serious  --  we ourselves were proof of the seriousness of the thing . I had expected not to like F. W. Bennett . But he was insane . How could I resist that ? There was this manic energy of his , a mad light in his eye . He was free ! That was what free lllen were like , they shone their freedom over everyone . I did n't want to think what he did with Clara I could not dream that  | she could matter to him in any way at all that I would recognize . I swung my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his house and his lands and his train and his resident poets , had not prepared me for the impersonal force of him , the frightening freedom of him . In the late afternoon we knocked off work , having unearthed the boulder to its southern polar slope . It sat now in an enormous trench at the bottom of which were packed several other stones . It looked as if it weighed several tons . On the way back we stopped in front of the main house to report these findings . Bennett stood on his front porch . He was very pleased . " We 'll take it as far down as it goes , boys , " he said . " And tomorrow we 'll look for markings . I want to see if it has markings . " Apparently as he gazed at these dirty and sweat-stained workmen he saw in the face of one something that might have been disbelief . " You , Joe , " he said to me , " you think it 's just a rock , do n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't know what to say . " Come inside . I want you to see something . " He turned and went in the house . Someone reached over and took the pick from my shoulder . I heard a snicker . I followed F. W. Bennett into his front hall and went past the stairway of halved logs to the sunken living room . There was a shimmering light on the ceiling , a reflection of the lake . But the floor was in shadow . In one corner , on a table , was a book with line drawings of primitive stone monuments : in all cases one large boulder rested on three or four smaller ones . " You see ? " he said . " I 'm not as crazy as you think . They put down these megaliths , or dolmens , for their fallen chiefs . " He strode around the room lecturing me on the burial practices of ancient Indian tribes of New England . He compared them to the ancient burial practices of the Western desert tribes . Indoors he seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice was somewhat hoarse , it suggested age . I stood in my filthy dark greens wondering how I was going to get out of there . A maid came in holding a phone on a long cord . She brought it to his side and held it for him on her palm while he picked up the receiver .  | " Yes ? " He continued to move about , and the maid in her light green uniform followed him dutifully where he went , dealing with the cord so that it would n't snag on the furniture . He was getting information . He asked short questions  --  How many ? What time ? ? and listened to lengthy answers . I looked out the bay wall of windows . The late afternoon shadows made the lake a brilliant dark blue water . On the terrace a woman was arranging flowers in a vase . I realized I was looking at Lucinda Bailey Bennett , the aviatrix . The small shock of seeing someone famous . " You do n't know how to work cameras , by any chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . " I 've got all this equipment here but I ca n't get the hang of it myself , " he said . " I want to take proper pictures of the excavation and send them out to see if I 'm right . " " I do n't know anything about cameras , " I said . " I thought you were smart . . . Well , " he said , " I wanted to take a look at you , anyway , to see if you belong with me on a permanent basis . What 's your opinion ? " " You mean a job ? " I said . " That 's what I mean . You think you ought to be hired ? " I swallowed . " No , " I said . " No ? " He seemed amused . " I could n't live here , " I said . " It 's not for me . " He laughed out loud . " You seemed to have adapted well enough . From what I understand you 've made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye . He stepped onto the terrace , closing the glass doors behind him , and stood calling down the hill to somebody at the boathouse . My muscles were tight and my hands clenched . I tried to loosen up . Mrs. Bennett glanced through the window to where I was and said something to her husband . He turned to her smiling and said something back and she looked again in at me briefly , a half smile on her face . She was a very elegant , honest-looking lady , very well coinposed , with brown hair cut short , no make-up or anything like that , she wore a loose sweater and a longish skirt and low-heeled shoes 1 thought von would not be able  | to tell , if you did n't know , that this slim handsome woman with her flowers knew how to fly the hell out of airplanes . And then it came to me he was telling her who the boy inside was . The one and only Joe of Paterson . She was so elegant I realized that what I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view pathetic . I felt betrayed , like a child who gives out his most precious secret and hears it laughed about . I turned to leave . I thought how powerful this Bennett was if I could be made to feel so bad from just a moment or two of his attention . " Just a minute , Joe , " he called . " I 'm not finished with you . " He went past me into the front hall and then down the corridor of the other wing of the house . He opened a door and beckoned to me . A large room filled with books , cabinets , with silver cups , photographs of Mrs. Bennett standing in front of airplanes , Mr. Bennett in a railroad engineer 's cap waving from the controls of a steam locomotive , photographs of cars and horses and presidents and governors and film stars . There were globes on stands and big dictionaries on lecterns , a ticker-tape machine under glass  --  a whole life of glory was in this room . Bennett sat down behind his desk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the papers in it for several minutes while I stood before him . Without looking up , he said , " Are your injuries healed ? " " I suppose . " " Have you been in touch with your parents ? " " My parents ? " " They signed a waiver , " he said , removing a document from the folder . " You mean you have n't talked to them ? I am not at fault for the injuries you incurred on my property . They received two hundred and fifty dollars . " " How do you know my parents ? " " We looked through your billfold . You might have been on your way out . I was too stunned to speak . " ' I'hcy have n't called or written to see how you 're getting along ? " He shoved a paper along the desk and I saw at the bottom the shaky signature  | of my father . " I 'm not lying to you , " Bennett said . " By rights that 's your money . I shook my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Fine . You can go home and if you 're smart you can use that money to make money . Buy something and sell it for profit . Anything , it does n't matter . Some of the great fortunes in this country were built from less . " I pictured my father in the kitchen , coming to terms with this legal paper that had to be signed . Finding my school pen somewhere in a drawer and the bottle with Waterman 's ink . Testing the penpoint on the oilcloth that covered the table and then rubbing the ink off with his thumb before it dried . My mother standing at the sink , washing the dishes , disguising the moment of the waiver in their lives as one more ordinary moment . " No , " I said . " It 's theirs .

Bow his head . Agree . Go along . Do what everyone 's doing . Let it leach away . Sign it away . Drink it away . Sleep it away . " He was standing at the window meditating , eclipsing the window light so that the dark bulk of him was apparent . He was stocky and short-legged with a large head , like a mountain troll . " Well , " he said , " you 're brash enough . Where are you going ? " " I do n't know . As far as I can get . " He came back to his desk and wrote something on a piece of paper . " You happen to need something  --  this is a private number , not to be given out , you understand ? " He folded the paper and handed it to me . He gave me a quick glance , one eyebrow arching over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave until I 've got my dolmen , " he said , turning and picking up his telephone .  | he first chance I had I hurried to Penfield 's . He was the only one who could help me with Clara 's escape . That was his word , escape . Clara would leave because she was dislodged by the returning wife , Clara would leave because with unforgivable haste she 'd been removed from the cozy confidences of Loon Lake 's master bedroom . But it would n't do to tell him that . He thought he was in torment for her sake . He brooded about rescuing her . That 's the way poets are , I said to myself . They see what no one else can see , and what is clear to everyone else they do n't see . I found him in bed . His breath rasped . His skin was a strange pink-gray color and it shone in a glaze of perspiration . He stared at me mournfully from his pillows , his blue and bloodshot eyes swimming in helplessness . Oh God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found Libby in the staff house . " I 'll have nothing to do with you , " she said . " It 's not Inc , Libby . It 's Mr. Penfield , Something 's wrong with him . I think lie needs a doctor . "  | She looked at me with suspicion . She went ahead of me to the stables and ran up the stairs to keep as much distance between us as she could . She took one look at the poet and without troubling to remove herself from his hearing said , " There 's nothing wrong with him , he just likes to carry on . " What do you know , Libby ? " he cried out , stung . " I know what a hollow leg is , " she said . " Look at this place , it 's enough to make anyone sick . " " Get out , get out ! " Penfield shouted . " Will everyone torture me ? Am I to die with the scorn of servants in my ears ? " She ignored him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up papers books dirty socks . " Go away , " he shouted . " Do n't touch a thing , damnit , you 're disrupting everything ! " She straightened his bedcovers and plumped up his pillows while he shouted at her to leave him alone . Furious with both of us , she marched out . " Joe , there 's a bottle of wine under the window seat , " Mr. Penfield said . I wondered what was wrong with me to be so gullible to the claims of this man . He lived here at Loon Lake sloshing in self-pity , the best aspect of him , his gift for poetry , put to the use of unsound notions . Obviously this was the solution of his life . I could n't change that if I tried . Nobody could . I handed him the bottle and a glass . He sat up . " Mr. Penfield , I 've got to tell you something , " I said , pulling a chair to his bedside . " But I need some information first . Who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the train ? " " Tommy Crapo , " he said . " Who ? " " Tommy Crapo . The industrial consultant . " He drank off a half-glass of wine . " Do n't you read the newspapers ? Do n't you look at the tabloids ? Tommy Crapo who has his picture taken on night-club banquettes with beautiful women . " Color was coming back to his face . I Ic emptied the glass and lay back on his pillows .  | " Is he in the rackets ? " " Mr. Crapo is a specialist in labor relations . Yes . I think that 's a fair description . " " Does he work for Bennett ? Does he knock heads for Bennett ? " He stared at the ceiling . A moment passed . " Why do you ask ? You think I should get Miss Lukafs away from here , do n't you ? " " Well , she 's ready . " " What ? " He was not used to being taken at his word . He was not equipped for action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , " I said . " What ? " " She 's ready to make her escape . " I have committed many sins in my life . This precise sin  --  the sin against poets  --  is without absolution . He was out of bed and struggling into a worn maroon robe that had a few tassels left on the belt . I could hear each breath he took . He got on his knees to look under the bed for his slippers . He found them , stood , stepped into them , and then went slapping across the floor , back and forth from one corner of his apartment to another without purpose or intent but busy with agitation . I sat him down in his reading chair and brought him a cigarette and lit it for him , he held it between thumb and forefinger , his hand shaking . " What did she say ? " he asked . " She wants me to get her away . " " You ? " " She thinks if you leave together , you 'll be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What ? " " Crapo does n't know me from Adam . " " Crapo is back ?

" " I 've worked out a plan but I need money and I need a car . "  | " Yes , yes , so that 's the way it happens . I see . I see . " He was not fooled , he was not a fool , the large protuberant eyes stared through me . " Yes , yes . To be absolutely realistic I 'm not in the picture . That 's all right , it 's just , I 'm reconciled . The two young ones . Yes . " He kept talking this way . I had the uncanny feeling that he was translating what I told him into another language . Yet I could hear everything he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strode back and forth from the window to the door . " Yes , of course , there is more than I knew . Yes . I want this for her . It 's just . I put my faith in you , Joe . Yes , take her away from here . Two young people ! It 's right . Yes , it 's the only way . " " I 'll need money and a car , " I said . " Of course . Leave it to me . I 'll help you . I 'll get you both out . You 'll see , you 'll see . I have resources . Yes . You 'll find Warren Penfield comes through . I have resources . I have allies . " He seemed joyful . He clapped his hands together and glanced heavenward to express his joy . In this moment he would rather have died than reveal his anguish . As I was leaving he stood at the door and pulled back the sleeve of his robe . " Look here , Joe . " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sign of the wild dog ! Right ? " He gave me a wan but demonstrably brave smile . I had to smile back . I rolled up my sleeve and showed my arm . " That 's right , " he said . " You know what two men do who share the sign of the wild dog ? " He touched his forearm to mine so that they crossed . " That 's right , " he said in a husky voice . " My pain is your pain . My life is your life .

A boy enjoys ice cream from a wooden spoon in the sun before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner while he waits for the light to change . At this moment several things happen . A horse pulling the wagon of a peddler of vegetables trots by smartly golden balls of dung dropping from the base of its arched tail . Then there was a whirring in my ears and over the top of Paterson Grade School Three a monumental dirigible nosed into view looming so low I could see the seams of its paneled silver skin and human shadows on the windows of its gondola . It was not sailing straight through its bow but shouldering the wind shuddering dipping and rising in its sea of air . It soared over the roof of a tenement and disappeared . At the same time the traffic light turned green and I crossed from sun to shade noting that the not unpleasant odor of fresh horse manure abruptly ceased with the change of temperature . In front of the shoe repair on Mechanic Street at the sidewalk 's edge between a Nash and a Hudson parked at the curb a baby girl was suspended from her mother 's hands her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she relieve herself there and then schoolchildren going past in bunches peddlers at their cars mothers pushing strollers and an older boy with ice cream stopping shamelessly to watch .

I waited five minutes and then I dropped my shovel and sauntered off . " Where you going ! " someone called behind me . I raised my hand to show I knew what I was doing and that I 'd be right back . This was the trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake , a mile down from the main house . It was hoed regularly to keep it soft ? I had done some of that myself . It went through stands of towering pine and over small clearings where the grass was turning tan and gold in the autumn , and then it dropped down into an area where the leaves were falling like snowflakes . I felt the same turning season in me . Where the trail cornered , along the shore of the wide lake , was an airplane hangar with a concrete ramp . Mr. Penfield sat on the ramp with his arms around his knees . He was looking at the water . The wind had whipped up a small white chop . Wavelets slapped at the concrete . He did n't seem to notice Lucinda Bailey Bennett coming out of the hangar and walking toward him . She pulled a big red trainman 's handkerchief from the pocket of her overalls and wiped her hands . I ducked around through the underbrush and came within a few feet of them . I could see inside : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guiding it to a workbench . " What do you do , Lucinda , " said Mr. Penfield in a petulant tone . " Paint the innards like a new toy ? " " No , old hear . When I 'm through , its innards will be dark and oiled , and refitted to tolerances that will take me to the top of the sky . " She stuffed her handkerchief into , the pouch of her overalls . " Why are you sulking ? I thought you loved inc. "  | " Since I gave up manhood to live here , I make no claims of that sort on anyone . She smiled . " That 's not the report I have . " " Oh , Lucinda , " he said with a groan , and he turned to look up at her . " So much suffering . " She touched the back of her hand to his temple . " Poor Warren . " " How much better for me if when I came here my throat had been ripped out . " She sighed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . " After a moment she turned back and he lifted himself grunting to his feet . He lumbered after her . " Forgive me , " he called . " Oh , Warren , it 's such a bore when you whine . " She went into the hangar . " Yes , " he cried out bitterly . " Indeed . My agony does not divert . " And he followed her . I could n't hear them now . The hangar was lit by electric lights that glimmered very faintly through the brightness of the morning . But I saw them moving around , she working and he talking with grand gestures . Every once in a while I heard the sound of his voice , and I knew Mr. Penfield well enough to know he was in good form , eloquent in his self-dramatization . I hoped so , because he was talking for me . The man who 'd been helping came out , lit a cigarette and went off along the trail . I moved to the hangar itself , staying out of sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall . " You have a good nature , " I heard Mrs. Bennett say . " Oh my dear ! " " Would you like to go on a flight ? Probably not . But a really long flight . Just the two of us . Would you consider it ? " " What ? Where ? " " I do n't know . The Far East . Shall we do that ? Fly across the Pacific . " " The Far East ? " " Yes , pooh bear . A long flight . You and I. Oh , that 's a good idea ! Who knows what might happen . " She burst out laughing . " Warren , if you could see the expression on your face ! ' I'Iic dismay ! " " Lucinda , what ? Ilow is it possible ? Am I misunderstood ? "  | " Oh , foolish thing  --  I do n't mean that ! Good God ! " She was merry now . " It 's a practice made too thoroughly disreputable by its devotees , do n't you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . I stood on the terrace just out of the light cast through the windows and I watched them at their drinks . A fire blazed in the huge fireplace . Mounted prey gazed down at them . Clara was wearing a gown of sequined silver . She looked cheap . She sat staring at the floor , cowed , maybe even stunned into silence , by the nuances of civilization in that room . The gentlemen wore black tie , in which Mr. Penfield managed to look as rumpled and ill-prepared for life as ever . With his characteristic expression of appeal for love and understanding he glanced habitually at the others , but especially Clara . Lucinda Bennett smiled faintly and kept up her end of the conversation . Only F. W. Bennett seemed to be enjoying himself . He became so animated he stood up to deliver his sentences . He went to a table behind the leather sofa and held up a large flat book opened , and resting on his arm , and he read from it and laughed and looked at the others for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cabin and found her luggage standing just inside the front door . There were three bags and a hatbox . I got all of them under my arms or hanging from my hands , and struggled up the hill to the garage on the far side of the tennis court . This was the old Loon Lake stable . It housed five cars . In the last stall was Mrs. Bennett 's car , a rarely used gray two-door Mercedes-Benz with a canvas top and spare tires in the front fender wells . I looked for the ignition key where Mr. Penfield had told me to  --  in the bud vase on the right-hand side in the back . Yes . I packed the bags in the trunk , which was not large , and put the hatbox in the back seat . I turned on the map light and by its glow learned the European-style shifting . There were four gears , and a diagram of their positions was imprinted on the mother-of-pearl knob of the floor shift . The dust on the seat cracked under me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed less than ten thousand miles . ' l'licn I saw it was not even miles , it was kilometers . Lucinda Bennett had told Mr. Penfield it was a 1933 model . Clearly ,  | her interest in machines did not include cars . The license plate was up to date , however . I swung open the doors as quietly as I could and got in and started the engine . I backed out . It was a noisy car  --  I later found it was only forty horsepower  --  and I drove it the few yards to the gas pump shushing it as if it were a baby . I filled it with Mr. Bennett 's personal ethyl and then I ga ' e each tire a shot of his air . I was wearing his knickers and argyle sweater and brown-and-white saddle shoes . I tried not to get them dirty . I was ready to go . I waited behind the wheel . It was a snug little car . The seats were gray leather . The doors opened front to back . I went over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of the car and worried about driving it well , and wondered where to go and what I would say to Clara Lukafs and what she would say to me . I worried that people seeing me behind the wheel would think I was rich . I did n't once reflect on the lately peculiar conforming of life to my desires . I did n't think of Lucinda Bennett 's generosity or despair , or Mr. Penfield 's , nor even reach the most obvious conclusion ; that I was leaving Loon Lake in somewhat better condition than I had come . Calculating , heedless , and without gratitude , I accepted every circumstance that had put me there , only gunning my mind to the future , wanting more , expecting more , too intent on what was ahead to sit back and give thanks or to laugh or to feel bad . I peered through the windshield . I watched the trees shaking in the night wind . I unlatched the canvas top and pushed it back a bit and looked at the stars , which seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Eventually she got there , hurrying along with Mr. Penfield holding her arm , while she held her gown off the ground to keep from tripping . She wore a fur jacket over the gown . He opened the door , but before she could slide in , he grabbed her and hugged her and started to gabble something . I saw all this with their heads cut off . I saw her push him away . " War-rin , please ! " she said . Then she was in the car beside mc , in an atmosphere of fur and cold air , and she slammed the door . Penfield peered in , then ran around the front of the car to the driver 's side . I started the engine and threw the toggle switch for the headlights . I adjusted the throttle . I rolled clown my LOON LAKE 121  | window and he thrust something in my hand , a wad of bills . " I wish it was more , " he said . He gave us advice of many kinds , cheerful assurances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep in touch , phone numbers on bits of paper , promises , vows , thrown kisses  --  and to this fitful love song I put the car into first , and off we lurched down the road . We were taking what was called the back road , away from the main house ; there was a sudden bend , and Mr. Penfield , waving in the night in his black tie , veered out of my rear view . I leaned forward , attentive to the clutching , and gradually , as we made our way bumping and sliding over this gravelly unpaved circuit through the Bennett preserve , I got the hang of it . We drove for quite a while . I glanced at her . In the glow of the dashboard I saw her young face . I think now of that long drive down through the forest to the state road , dogs appearing from nowhere to gallop yelping alongside , their breath sounding metallic , like the engine ; and disappearing just as suddenly , then again one or two of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying nothing , only holding the leather strap by her window , looking out to the side , to the front , her eyes following them tracking them , the youth of her illuminated in the low light . Finally we outdistanced them all . She sat back in her seat . She took a cigarette out of her purse and lit it . " What do you think he 'll do when he finds you gone ? " I said . " An interesting question , " she said . And so we descended from Loon Lake , Clara 's clear eyes fixed on the farthest probe of the headlights , and I looking at her every other moment , in her composure of total attention , going with the ride .  | Every morning she swept the dirt path outside the monastery wall . She always wore the same thing , a simple kimono and those wooden slippers , you know ? She was fifteen or sixteen years old but her hair was cut in the bowl cut of young children . Hair as black as night . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was such a flash of recognition from my soul that I went weak with joy . Oh , Warren . I used to wake up before dawn and do my chores and manage always to be at the gate when the sun rose and she came to do hers . She was the daughter of some working family down the street . They sweep the streets there with straw brooms . The unpaved streets . They sweep the dirt , compose it . They compose everything , they pick the fallen leaves one at a time . How did you get to her ? I wish you would n't phrase it that way , Lucinda . We knew each other on sight . We had to . My Japanese was less than rudimentary . I Ic  --  r English nonexistent . ( ) Illy the tipper classes studied English It was a great social  | distinction to know English . A workman 's daughter could n't aspire to that . Light me a cigarette , will you ? I have in my life just three times seen a face in dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillow , in which there is a recognizably perfect perception of the world , some matched reflection of the world in her eye 's light as terrifying and beautiful in equal measure . Am I coherent ? A moral light ? Is that what you mean ? She lives through her fear to her curiosity , there is a stillness of apprehension , like an animal 's stillness of perfect apprehension of its predator , and it is gallantry to break the heart . I wish we had known each other when we were young . Her father and several uncles made up a delegation to complain about my conduct to the monastery officials , who of course did not have to be told . I had broken every rule in the book . At the moment both sides gathered to come down on us we slipped away together and took the train to Tokyo . We found a room . Is this when you became lovers ? I suppose so . I thought I could support us by teaching American customs and manners to Japanese businessmen . They wanted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jazz and danced the Charleston . You 're not crying , are you ? It makes me sad . I know what happened . I left the house one morning . I had an appointment to see someone at the U.S. embassy . It was a Saturday , the first day in September , 1923 . As I walked down the street , I lost my balance but suddenly people everywhere were screaming . The streets were cracking open . I ran back , the city was falling down everywhere , I climbed over rubble , I saw her coming after me with her arms raised , the cobblestones heaved , the street broke open , it filled with water , I reached her and grabbed her hand just as the earth sank away and she fell in , she fell from my hands and where the earth had been there was a steaming lake . What is that up ahead , Lucinda ? I t looks very dark . Its nothing A line squall.  | he nights seemed to race by . The weather got colder . The freaks got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promising than any I 'd seen . It was shut down and boarded . One tavern and one store were open . I do n't remember the name of this town , it was like a tree with just a branch or two still alive . In a lot beside the boarded-up railroad depot Sim Hearn gave the signal and the carney put up for business . In the evening we turned on the lights and a few mountain people straggled in but most of the time the freaks talked to each other because nothing else was doing . The rides went around empty . I thought Sim Hearn had lost his marbles . The next night the same thing , the wind blew through the booths and rattled the tent flaps , they sounded like over the mountains somewhere there was some gang war of Tommy guns going on . I thought Sim Hearn was telling us the season was over by enacting the news . The cook built a fire on the ground and heated an ash can of water . He scrubbed his pots and pans with brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed my arm and we stepped behind a wagon .  | " Hearn goes no farther , " she said . " Look , a sweater I have for you so you would n't be cold . " She was a pain in the ass with her presents . She brought me cigarettes , oranges , she washed my clothes , all in secret of course . Nobody knew about it except the whole carney . It chilled me to think Sim Hearn might know it . But his distance from me was unchanged and his peculiar authority maintained itself in my mind . It was as if no matter what I did to his wife I could never break through that supreme indifference . I decided no man was that godlike . I decided he did n't know . I wished he did know . Then I would n't be some nameless creature so low as to be beneath his line of vision . The next morning we struck everything but the show tent . We raised the wood shutters on the wagons and nailed them shut . We pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the depot . anyone else . I think I was shocked . Despite all my other feelings about the carney , I could believe it was a privilege to be attached to it . It angered me that people would walk away as if Hearn Bros. had no more distinction than a mission flop . On the other hand , why should it be different ? Sim Hearn could n't care less if any one of them lived or died and they knew that . He was going to take the trucks down to Florida for the winter and let them get down there on their own . If they showed up , he 'd hire them ; if they did n't , that was all right too . Fanny the Fat Lady 's wagon was in place and had n't been moved . I saw Mrs. Hearn coming out of her trailer . " Fanny wheezes like calliope , " she said . " Well , why does n't someone get a doctor ? " She put her hand on my cheek and looked in my eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what will happen to you . " Several of the freaks were leaving in a group . I was told to take a truck and drive them about fifteen miles to a town called Chester , where there was a spur line to Albany . It was the afternoon , already getting dark . In the cal ) with Inc sat the woman who took care of Fanny . The whole ride she wept and blew her nose . She spoke to herself in Spanish as if her  | running stream of thoughts and sorrows came up over the banks every now and then . She thought I was n't looking when she lifted her skirt and fingered the metal clip of her garter to make sure it was fastened properly . I saw tucked in the top of her stocking a wad of bills that looked like a lot of money . I let off the truckload of freaks and their keepers in Chester , New York , and they hopped , climbed or were lowered from the tailgate . They went limping and scuttling into the waiting room carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly immigrants , after all  --  the same people but with a twist who worked for pennies in the sawmills or stood on the bread lines . But I imagined the stationmaster seeing through his grill this company of freaks in ordinary streetclothes approaching him with questions of schedule and tickets . Why did n't I get on the train with them ? Did I really want to drive a truck to Florida ? Did I want to bang Mrs. Magda Hearn in more states of the Union ? I thought of the freaks as pilgrims or revolutionaries of some angry religion nobody knew anything about yet . When I got back it was already dark . I could tell something was wrong , there were lots of cars there and wagon teams . I cut the engine and stood on the running board . Beyond the lot was a hill that rose steeply , blacker than the sky , I could see its outline against the blue-black space of sky behind it . I thought I heard a scream . I listened  --  it was something else , a drumming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaten . I walked toward the show tent , there was the dimmest light in there . A man stepped out of the shadow and put his hand on my arm . A flashlight shone in my eyes . " Who 's this ? " a voice said . And then I heard Magda Hearn . " It 's all right . He 's with the show . " My arm was still held and I could feel the consideration of this intelligence in the mind behind the light . The flashlight went off . I made out the figure of a state treiiper , blocked hat and gun and Sani Browne belt .  | Then my arm was released , the marks of the fingers still on me , like the afterimage on the eye . Magda Hearn was walking me toward the show tent . " Joe , " she said , " I want you to see , to understand . And I wait for you in the car . Do you hear me ? " " What 's going on ? " I said . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please to listen . " She was whispering in my ear and in each cycle of her crippled gait , the sibilance rose and fell in waves of urgency . Then I passed through the flaps . The show tent had a few rows of wooden bleachers and a small ring where the ponies could run around and the bareback sisters , if they were so inclined , could do their turns . A cat act had been featured here for a while . The bleachers were empty . One bulb burned from the tent pole . Eighty , maybe a hundred men stood in a circle in the dirt of the ring . I could n't see over their backs but I heard the not unfamiliar night music , the grunts and gurgling moans and squeals of Fanny the Fat Lady . As the rhythm got faster the crowd shouted encouragement . Then I heard that peculiar basso thumping as if the earth itself was being drummed . Then an abrupt silence and the hoarse male roar of expiration . Whistles and cheers came from the crowd , men turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . Staggering through the ring , buttoning his pants , was a grifter I recognized . He sank down on his knees beside me , removed a flask from his back pocket and took a long pull . Some sort of hot shame rose from the roots of my sex into my stomach and chest : it felt like illness . I pushed forward and saw Fanny on her back , arms and legs flung outward . She was naked . She lay twitching , each spasm jerking her flesh into ripples . She wheezed and fought for breath . The sweated slathered flesh was caked in dirt , but with white crevasses in the folds of her and a red blotch in the middle . I was pushed aside and spun around . A moment later another lover had fallen on her . The crowd yelled and jammed llt ) around me . She was quickly brought to pitch , her great hack rising and thumping into the earth , but this one did n't last  | long , and to great merry raucous hoots and jeers he stumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving forward for his turn . I jumped him just as he unbuckled his belt . I knocked him down and kicked him in the groin . He yowled , doubling up and clutching himself and I took his place crouching beside Fanny , facing them all , my fists clenched . I was screaming something , I do n't remember what , it stunned them for a second , and then they were laughing and taunting me and shouting at me to wait my turn . Fanny lay there trembling in her agony and her eyes were rolled into her head . Her mouth was open and giving off gasping animal wheezes . Maniacally , I felt betrayed by her , as by life itself , the human pretense . I became enraged with her ! In my nostrils , mixed with the sharp fume of booze , was an organic stench , a bitter foul smell of burning nerves , and shit and scum . Then something flew out at me , a pint bottle , or a rock , and caught me low on the forehead . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights in my brain . I had fallen on Fanny , she was like some soft rotten animal carcass . Her arms helplessly went around me . I was panicked and tried to get free . My struggles were mistaken  --  I was pulled out of her grasp by my feet and dragged through the dirt and kicked and rolled and yanked to my feet and given a clout on the side of the head . I found myself on my knees , behind the crowd . I was wet . Blood streamed in my eye . But the ceremony continued . There were men drooling there . There were onanists . There were gamblers betting on the moment of death . Later there were men leaping on her , on each other , squatting on her head , crawling over her , falling on her , shoving bottles in her . There were gallants calling for order , for some law of decency if all pleasure was not to be lost . And Fanny giving up a human appearance by degrees , trumpeting her ecstasies to the killing passion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this mayhem . I looked at him . His face was hidden in the shadow of his hat brim . You would n't know his connection with these spernry rites except for the indolence of his stance as he leaned against the bleacher supports with his bony arms  | folded and his ankles crossed . And I could swear I heard , through the hoarse cries and shouts and shrieking and orgiastic death , the thoughtful and preoccupied sucking of Sim Hearn 's tongue on his teeth . Riding over the mountain in the Model A , Joe became aware of where he was . She accelerated , the headlights brightened ; she braked , the headlights dimmed . The bones of his legs sounded the ground pitch of the engine . Mrs. Hearn 's face luminous in the night , she urged the car forward with her chin , her furrowed brow , her shoulders putting english on the turns . At the bottom of a hill she gunned it , halfway up plunged with her left leg , shifted to second , she came over the tops of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick stab at the night sky . " Of course they never live long , such creatures  --  the heart wo n't beat for them . . . All summer Sim Hearn watches  --  he watches and then he sees the signs  --  she does n't take breath as she should  --  from the bed she can not lift het self . . . The people know Hearn  --  he gives something special at end of summer , a grand finale . . . The word goes through the mountains . . . Look where we are  --  we make time better than I hoped . " In the early hours of the morning she judged us safely away and turned into a motor court and paid for a cabin in the pines farthest from the road . Wedged into the rumble seat was my broken-down valise with everything I possessed in the world . She had packed it for me . I carried it and her frayed black Gladstone into the room . She locked the car and locked the cabin door behind us and pulled the shades and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanket but no sheets . Two lumpy gray pillows . Magda Hearn rummaged in her bag for a white cotton face towel . She spread the towel on top of the bureau . The room had the shit smell of old untreated wood . She removed from her purse a manila envelope and from the envelope removed a stack of greenbacks which she placed on the cotton towel . " Sim knows to get the money out before the fun starts , " she said . " To Albany to the hank he thinks I am going . " She wet her thumb on her lower lip and stood at the bureau counting  | the money . I sat down on the bed and took off my shoes and socks . She wet her thumb on the inside of her lower lip , pulling it down so that for a moment her teeth showed her expression went slack . She was a while counting . " Fifteen hundred and eighty-four dollars ! " She dug in her purse and extracted a wallet and from this withdrew another wad of bills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said in a tone of vengeful triumph . The thumb applied to the red inside of her lip . She counted aloud this time . " Two hundred I squeeze from you , you bastard ! " She opened her Gladstone , interrupting herself to press her lips strongly on my mouth . She pulled the string tie of a small canvas coin sack and spilled a stream of coins on the bed . She lay on the bed making separate piles of nickels and dimes and quarters and halves , the little piles collapsed and came together because she was shaking the bed with her guttural glee . She started over , she was keen on pennies , too  --  if there had been coins of smaller denominations , she would have counted them , too . She was ready to count coins forever and to bitterly calculate the suffering she had done for each one . " Joe Joe Joe ! Tomorrow we trade his car and its license and buy new . We drive to California you and me . We are in our new car on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " She gave up the count and lay on her back in the coins . She lifted her arms . " Come to me , come to Magda . You know what ? " Kissing me , running hands on me , opening one by one the buttons on my fly . " To Hollywood we are going . I have read the magazines , I understand the movie business . I sell my life story . A film of my life ! Everyone will know who Magda is . " She unbuckled my belt , she opened the buttons of my shirt . She kissed my chest and pulled the shirt down off my shoulders . " And who knows who knows , with your looks , my Joseph , with your body , why you can not be movie star ? And we will love each other and have great sooccess . Shall we ? " Laughing , going down on me . " Shall we ? " She had no idea I had actually caught evil as one catches a fever , she did n't understand this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | to do to her what had been done to the Fat Lady , I wanted the force of a hundred men in unholy fellowship , I went at her like a murderous drunkard . I fucked past her joy into her first alarm , I saw on her face under the weak glare of the hanging bulb the dilated eye . I was enraged by the flaws of her , the unnatural cleft of her left hip , one buttock was actually atrophied , the raised veins behind the knees , the hanging breasts like deflated balloons , the yellowed face with loosened folds of skin at the neck rising in parallel rows as she turned her head from me this stinking Hungarian hag this thieving crone bitch with the gall to think she had me for her toy boy her lover chuffing now like a fucking steam engine I brought the tears to her eyes she would acknowledge nothing she resisted and then the voice did come , and then the voice louder and more insistent , and finally she seemed to be urging me along as if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Motor Court , our music mingling with the night wind in the pines the tree trunks creaking the million crickets . I ended and began again . We wrestled . She begged me to stop . Tears of mourning came from my eyes . I let her fall asleep . I woke her , made her moan . At one point the coins sticking to the wet ass , the wet belly , I invented a use of Magda Hearn so unendurable to her that with the same cry that must have come from her the day she fell twisting from the trapeze , she flung herself off the bed a moment 's silence , then the sickening shaming sound of bone and flesh slamming into the floor , a grunt . I lay on my back on the bed not daring to look , I heard a small soprano cry , a deeper moan , a whispered curse . I lay still . After a while I realized I was listening to the snores of an exhausted human being . I thought I saw the first crack of light under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled my clothes and shoes into a bundle . I grabbed the stack of bills from the bureau . I unlatched the door quietly and closed it behind me . There were no other guests at the Pine Grove Motor Court . A thin frost lay on the windshield of the Model A. The wind blew . With all my might I reared back and threw the bills into the wind . I thought of them as the Fat Lady 's ashes . I found a privy tip the hill behind the cabins and next to it an outdoor shower . I st ( xxl in the shower of cold springwater and looked up at the  | swaying tops of the pine trees and watched the sky lighten and heard through the water and the toneless wind the sounds of the first birds waking . I dried myself as best I could and put on my clothes in a tremble of stippled skin and turned my back on the cabins and struck off through the woods . I had no idea where I was going . It did n't particularly matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods as to another world .  | Pt Kamakura he climbed the spiral stairs inside the largest Buddha in the world . In the head of the largest Buddha , on the ledge of its chin , sat a tiny Buddha facing in the opposite direction . Simple idolatry held no interest for him , but a religion that joked held genuine interest . He felt all at once the immense power of a communication that used no words . I acknowledge Warren 's lifelong commitment  --  cancel lifelong commitment  --  fatal attraction for any kind of communication whether from words , flags , pigeons or the touch of fingertips in hope of a common language , but we must remember how we are vulnerable to the repetition of our insights so that they tend to come to us not as confirmation of something we already know but as genuine discoveries each and every time . And so he descended , and by degrees over a period of several days , drifted south along the route of the old Tokaido . He saw thousands of Buddhas lined up in trays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrines , some in lead , some in wood , some carved in stone and dressed in little knitted caps and capes . I le came to see in this ubiquitous phenomcmm the Buddha 's godlike propensity for self-division , the endless frac-  | tioning of himself into every perceivable aspect , an allegory made by the people of Japan from the cellular process of life . Thus enlightened , he turned his eyes on the people in the streets and the narrow shopping arcades , old women in black slapping along on their sandals , black-haired children of incredible beauty staring at him with their thumbs stuck in their plump cheeks , giggling pairs of young women in brightly colored kimonos , old shopkeepers with wispy goatees bowing as he passed , thoughtful peddlers , and young men who stopped in their tracks to glare at him and bear themselves with brazen umbrage  --  they were all the Buddha too in his infinite aspect . Traveling down this avenue of thought lit only by stone lanterns filled with small stones in lieu of flames , he saw the true dereliction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , love , the assumption of culture , the certainty of calendars were fragile constructs of the imagination , and there was no place to live that was truly home , neither for him nor for the multitudinous islanders of Japan . In this he-took-for-appropriate state of mind , Warren arrived one day at road 's end , Kyoto , the strange city whose chief industry was meditation . He wandered from one monastery to the next , there were whole neighborhoods of them , but where , where was the sign that one was for him ? He was afflicted with a fluttering humility , not daring even to make inquiries , hovering at this gate or in that garden or touching down for just a moment of indecision before the small window with the visitor admission in yen painted in black calligraphy on white cardboard stuck into the grate as if he were looking for a movie to see . Late in the afternoon , weary and full of self-condemnation , he happened to stumble up the step of a wooden verandah overlooking one of these beautiful monastery gardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his large Caucasian person hurtled through a rice-paper door , splintering its laths , and like an infant being born , he found himself with the back half of him still on the porch side of the door and the front half in a room , looking with wide , even horrified eyes at the benign polished wood Buddha sitting facing him with a little altar of flowers on either side and the sinuous smoke of incense appearing to squinch up its eyes . IIc had made a terrible thunderous racket but nobody came mining , nobxxiy rime shouting , and after he  | crawled the rest of the way into the room he set about calmly picking up the pieces and preparing in his mind the self-demeaning speech by which he would beg the chance to make the most extended and profound restitution . As it happened , the monastery was empty ; he was to learn it was the rare annual holiday of this particular establishment in which everyone was set free for twenty-four hours . Only after searching the grounds did Warren find an old caretaker willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . This old caretaker was smoking a cigarette , which he held in his teeth . He took in smoke with each inhalation and with each exhalation smoke streamed out of his nostrils . He gazed at the carnage , the plumes of smoke from his nostrils indicating the depth and strength of each drawn breath , and it seemed to fascinate him that such a perfect and modest structure as a sliding paper door should have been turned into this . He was a very short , extremely bald old man , and he wore a torn ribbed undershirt and a pair of dirty white muslin knickers with flapping ties at the waist but the peculiar thing was that he was not unpleasant to look upon , it did not create feelings of pity or fear or other degrees of patronization to look upon him . He picked up a broken length of lath and looked at it and asked a question in unintelligible Japanese . I 'll pay for it , Warren said and removed from his pocket a wad of yen . He unfolded the bills and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cigarette smoke . Warren peeled off one bill and put it in the man 's hand . Then another . Then another . He kept waiting for a sign that he 'd met the cost . He hesitated . The old man looked at him and peremptorily slapped his arm with the lath . Warren was so astonished he dropped the whole wad of bills in the old man 's hand . The caretaker put the bills into the pockets of his voluminous knickers , looked up at the Caucasian and swatted him again with the flat of the stick , this time across the side of his face . Then he laughed , and in so doing released his cigarette , which fell from his teeth and lay on the wooden floor glowing . Immediately Warren , thinking the whole place would go up , stepped on the tobacco ember with his large shoe , only realizing in that moment the defacement he had committed by stepping with street shoes on the monastery floors . But the caretaker had turned and headed back to his garden shed with  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravel . Warren experienced the uncanny sense of a sharply learned lesson . He slept that night at a Western hotel in the downtown section of Kyoto and found in the nightstand drawer a volume in English that seemed to be the Buddhist equivalent of the Bible . Gautama was an Indian prince kept at home by his father so as not to see life in any aspect but its most luxurious . But one day he went out and saw a beggar , an old crippled man , a monk and a corpse . He was thus able to conclude despite his own royal existence that life was suffering . Why could n't he have figured that out without leaving the palace ? Warren wondered . If death exists , life has to be suffering . Did his father hide death from Gautama ? How was that done ? The book said the cause of all suffering was desire , the desire to have the desire to be . Perhaps a prince would never experience the desire to have , but how could he avoid the desire to be ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realizes itself , does it not exist in palaces too ? Does it not exist especially in palaces ? Nevertheless , he liked the story . He trusted Gautama Siddhartha and the simplicity of his reasoning . Not many people could get away with that sort of reasoning . He trusted the eightfold path for defeating desire and transcending suffering . Early the next morning Warren went back to the monastery . The place was a shambles . Doors and shoji walls were splintered and torn everywhere . There were recumbent bodies on the verandah , and in the garden a monk lay in a pool of vomit . All the walls were torn and hanging , bodies lay about as if dead . There was even a body lying across the crest of the tile roof . The monastery looked as if it had been bombed . But even as he gazed at this dismal scene he heard the sound of small tinkling bells coming from somewhere in the main monastery building , and though the bells were soft and delicate they had the astonishing effect of rousing the Zen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groaned , rose to their feet and staggered off . And then around the corner came a man in white holding a staff of temple bells . His head was shaved , he was stout , the folds of his neck were like ruffles of a collar . he walked right up to Warren and inquired in heavily accented English if lie could he of help . I want to discuss with someone the possibility of enrolling here for Zen training ,  | Warren said . Of course , the monk said . If you do n't mind waiting more than two moments but less than six , I will approach the Master for you . More than two but less than six , Warren thought as he waited in an anteroom beside the front gate . That 's a few . Shortly thereafter he was escorted by the monk to a small room with a beautiful Bodhisattva pratima and a vase of flowers and straw mats and cushions , and without having to be told , even by himself , he dropped to his knees and bowed to the resident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of genial amusement . It was the old caretaker . On the one day off of the year for all his followers and monks , he , in perfect realization , had stayed where he was . The Master was smoking a cigarette . Another monk came by and listened . He was laughing and telling the monk , in Japanese , about his first meeting with Warren . Gusts of smoke came out of him . As the story was elaborated , the Master rose and began to act it out , and there to Warren 's astonishment was a perfect imitation of himself , the way he carried himself , his walk , the tone of his voice , the shock on his face as the lath slapped his cheek . The Japanese laughed till there were tears in their eyes . Soon Warren began to smile and then he too exploded into laughter . He would come to understand in the months to follow that the Master so perfectly realized whatever he chose to do , that a kind of magnetic field was formed in which whoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is why interviews with the Master were so highly prized . His perfection was an impersonal force that you could feel and hope someday to manifest from yourself on a continuous basis . If he laughed , it was perfect laughter , and you had to laugh too . If he chose to cry , everyone around him would have to weep . But where did it come from , how did it happen ? All Warren could work out was that the Master lived totally to the fullness of his being each and every moment of his existence . He was completely of the moment , then and there , in which you found him . Nothing of him was deadened by the suffering of his past life and there was no striving or fear in him for his future . Would the Master feel a need to write poems ? No , because poems arc the expression of longing and despair . Yes , because if the Master is one in every instant with what he sees and hears  | and feels , the poem is not the Master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , because the poem is a cry of the unborn heart . Yes , because the ) oem perfectly embodies the world , there is no world without poem . Your register apologizes for rendering nonlinear thinking in linear lan ; uage , the apperceptions of oneness in dualistic terminology . However , here is no difficulty representing the absolute physical torture of Warren enfield 's commitment to Zen meditation .

No , there is no problem expressing the inner record of Warren Penfield 's quest for enlightenment : the whining despair , the uncharacteristic epithet , the rage , the backsliding giving up and consequent self-nauseation , the stubborn goings on , all of this silent , in a temple hall of inscrutable meditators , all of whom reminded him of the immigrant kids in the Ludlow Grade School around him totally serene and insulated in their lack of language the feeling what do they all know that I do n't know why do n't the storms of self taste fire and thunder across their brainbrow , why are n't they as sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine , leading then to the false Zen-like casuistry as , for example , if we are to press ourselves on the world sticking to it like a decal , if I am one with the rocks the trees the stars why is my memory invalid and why then are the images of Clara on our beds of slag in the cool mountain dusk of Colorado forbidden me , I am my memory and the images of my past are me , and if I am the rocks and stones and trees , Wordsworth , rocked round in earth 's diurnal course with rocks and stones and trees , why are my phantoms less real why are the ghostvoices of my mama and papa less real why is the mud of the Marne less real why must I exclude exclude , if everything is now and mind is matter is not everything valid is not meditation the substance of the mind as well as its practice ? Nor is it difficult to render the casually developed outer circumstances of this monastic life , the old Master becoming at some times demonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humble ordinary lines of thought , an army of right practice , right understanding overwhelming the frail redoubts and trenches of Warren 's Western mind . One day they were in the temple and he came in screaming , naked , climbed the Buddha like a bee alighting on a flower and bending it with its own honeygravid weight and they watched shocked and stunned as a beautiful polished wood Buddha toppled to the floor under the Master , an act of profound desecration with sexual impact , and the Buddha lay split like a log , a piece of w(x)d the aperture of an earthquake and nothing was ever said of it again .  | e was a violent old man , one day Warren was admitted for his counseling id the Master threw a cup of cold green tea in his face and that was the sson of the day . One day he lectured them all , a particular holy day and shouted at them saying you were all Masters when you first came trough the gate and now look at you , I have more respect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  screaming and growling and illing in the Japanese way of singsong , Warren prostrate with all the rest . at everyone took it as material to be pondered and worked out , it was ily a style of pedagogy and only someone stupid enough to take emotions riously would be shocked threatened or angered by the serene antics of Le realized Buddha spirit of such a great Master . Warren finally reached Le preliminary kindergarten stage of getting his own koan , a paradoxical iestion to form the empty mind of meditation . Each devotee received s own koan like a rabbit 's foot to stroke and treasure , an unanswerable iestion to torment him month after month , perhaps year after year , until ilightenment burst over and he was able to answer it when the Master lntly asked it of him the hundred millionth time . Warren walked in ) wed , kneeled on the straw mat . The Master was smoking and making ch breath visible as a plume of cigarette smoke and Warren knew the andard koans , the famous ones , there were actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one given to him he had never heard More or read anywhere and it was delivered by the Master with a shake his head , a sigh and a glance of helpless supplication at the ceiling : mfield-san , said the Master , if this is a religion for warriors , what are u doing here ? Warren thanked him , bowed and backed out of the room en though the Master looked as if he was going to say something more . ' ter in his first pondering of this infinitely resounding question he uatted by his favorite place , near the garden gate beyond the gravel rden , and saw through the slats as for the first time the beautiful little rl who swept the street .  | drove out of the mountains through the night and found the way to Utica , New York , coming into city streets in the rain at three o'clock , passing freight yards , warehouses . She was asleep , I did n't want to wake her , I bumped the car gently across the railroad tracks and headed south and west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I could before Bennett got up in the morning . By dawn I was clear-eyed exhausted , feeling my nerves finely strung , the weariness in the hinges of my jaws , you are never more alert . Red lights in the dawn at intersections between fields , I saw the light of dawn shoot clear down the telegraph wires like a surge of power , I passed milk trucks and heard train whistles the sun came up and flooded my left eye suddenly it was day commerce was on the roads we had survived Loon Lake and were cruising through the United States of America . I woke her for breakfast , we walked into a diner  --  sonic town in Pennsylvania . Clara in her fur jacket and long dress and Junior in his knickers and sweater . Someone dropped a plate . Clara is not awake yet  --  a hard  | sleeper , a hard everything  --  she sits warming her hands on her coffee cup , studies the tabletop . " This wo n't do , " I said , steering her by the arm to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking for trouble . " I found an Army-Navy Surplus Store . I bought myself a regular pair of pants , work shirt , socks , a wool seaman 's cap and khaki greatcoat . I bought Clara a black merchant marine pullover and a pea jacket . I made her change her clothes in the back of the store . Then I did . Mr. Penfield had pressed upon me about eighty dollars in clean soft ones and fives , bills that looked as if they had spent years in a shoe box . I added to this the forty dollars or so of my own fortune . The clothes had come to twenty-eight , and another dollar and change for breakfast . " What kind of money do you have ? " " Money ? " " I want to see what our cash assets are . " " I do n't have any money . " " That 's really swell . " " Look in my bag if you do n't believe me . " " Well , how far did you think you could go without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me . " It was the best of conversations , all I could have wished for . I scowled . I drove hard . We took the bumps in unison , we leaned at the same angle on the curves . I did n't know where we were going and she did n't ask . I drove to speed . I stopped wondering what she was feeling , what she was thinking . She was happy on the move , alert and at peace , all the inflamed spirit was lifted from her . She had various ways of arranging herself in the seat , legs tucked up or one under the other , or arms folded , head down , but in any position definitive , beautiful . Come with me Late that afternoon we were going up a steep hill along the Monongahela , Pittsburgh spreading out below us , stacks of smoke , black sky , crucible fire . By nightfall I was munch , ( could n't drive another mile . We were in some town in eastern Ohio , maybe it was Steubenville , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the Rutherford Hayes , a four-story hotel with fire escapes and a barber 's pole at the entrance . I took a deep breath and pulled up to the curb . In the empty lobby were the worn upholstered chairs and half-dead rubber plants that would have been elegance had I not been educated at Loon Lake . I had never stayed at a hotel but I knew what to do from the movies . I got us upstairs without incident and tipped the bellboy fifty cents . " Yes , sub ! " he said . I chain-locked the door behind him . We had a corner room with large windows , each covered with a dark green pull shade and flimsy white curtains . Everything had a worn-out look , a great circle of wear in the middle of the rug . I liked that . I liked the idea of public accommodation , people passing through . Bennett could keep his Loon Lake . I looked out the window . We were on the top floor , we had a view of greater Steubenville . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been in hotels before , found the experience unexceptional . She opened her overnight bag and took over the bathroom . I smoked a cigarette and listened to the sounds of her bathing . I kept looking around the room as if I expected to see someone else . Who ? We were alone , she was alone with me and nobody knew where we were . I was smiling . I was thinking of myself crouched in the weeds in the cold night while a train goes by and a naked girl holds a white dress before a mirror . This was a double bed I had booked and she had n't even blinked . That would seem reason to hope . But for Clara Lukas there was no necessary significance in sleeping beside somebody in the same bed . She came out of the bathroom without a stitch . I undressed and turned out the light as cool in my assumptions as I could be . A high whine of impatience , a kind of child 's growl , and a poke of her elbow was what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark . Just testing . She curled up with her hack toward me , and those vertebrae which I had noticed and loved were all at once deployed like the Maginot Line .  | In the morning she woke out of sorts , mean . " What in hell am I doing here ? " she muttered . " Jesus , " she said , looking at me . " I must be out of my mind . " I was stunned . My first impulse was to appeal . " Look at him , hunky king of the road there . Oh , this is great  --  this really is great . " She snapped up the window shade and looked out . " God damn him , " she said . " And his wives and his boats and choo-choo trains . " She began to dress . She held up blouses , skirts , looked at them , flung them down . She sat abruptly on the bed with her arms full of clothes and she stared at the floor . " Hey , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of there and I did . Did n't I ? " She did n't answer . " Hey , girlie , " I said , " did n't I ? You have a complaint ? You think you 're some hot-ass bargain ? " " You bet I am , hunky , I can promise you . " " Well then , go on , " I said . " Go back to your fancy friends and see what they do for you . Look what they already done . " I got out of bed , pulled on my pants and socks , and stuck my feet in my shoes . " Where are you going ? " she said . " Here , " I said , taking out my wallet . I crumpled a couple of singles and threw them on the floor . " That and a twitch of your ass will get you back to the loons . " " You 're not leaving , " she said . " You 're not leaving me here ! " " You can go back to your career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on my shirt and combed my hair in the mirror over the dresser . " It 's probably as good as you can do anyhow . " The mirror shattered . I did n't know what she had thrown . When I went for her she was reaching for the Gideon Bible to throw that . I grabbed her arm and we knocked the bedside lamp to the floor . I pinned her to the bed . She tried to bite inc . I held her by the wrists and put my knees on each point of the pelvis.  | " You 're hurting me ! " I moved back and let go of her . She lay still . A queer bitter smell came from her . It was anger that aroused her , confrontation was the secret . But when I found her she was loving and soft and she shrank away softer and more innocent of her feelings than I had dreamed . I held her , I loved the narrow shoulders , the small-boned frailness of her , the softness of her breasts against me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she cried in the panic of the sensation , her legs could n't find their place , she was like a swimmer kicking out or like someone trying to shinny up a pole . I wanted her to know the sudden certainty declaring in me like God . I was where I belonged ! I remembered this ! But she did n't seem to be aware of how I felt , there was this distracted spirit of her , her head shook from side to side with bursts of voice , like sobs , as if someone was mourned . Our lovemaking was like song or like speech . " Do n't you see , " I asked again and again , " do n't you understand ? " And she shook her head from side to side in her distraction . I could n't overcome this . I became insistent , I felt my time running out , I felt I had to break into her recognition . It 's you , I wanted her to say , and she would n't she would n't say the words . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath from her , beating ugly grunts of sound from her , wanting her to form words but hearing savage stupid gusts of voiceless air coming from her . In my moment of stunned paralytic grief I groan I go off bucking I think I hear her laugh . For several days we made our life sleeping till mid-morning and getting on the road and driving again till the sun went down and we could find a bed . We drove through boarded-up towns , we ate blue-plate specials and we slept in rooming houses with linoleum on the floor and outhouses in back or in small motor-court cabins with the sound all night of the trucks rolling past . Night and morning we made love it was what we did our occupation our exercise . But always with great suspense in my mind . I never knew if it would happen again . I did n't have the feeling anything was established in her . She fucked in a kind of lonely self-intensification.  | She slept without touching me , she slept with no need to touch or hold me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I were n't there . I would think about this lying in the dark while she slept . I was there for her , I was what she assumed , and I was willing to be that , to be the assumption she did n't even know she was making . And then one day she 'd discover that she loved me . Once in a while , usually in the numb exhaustion of daybreak , I 'd look into her face and see an aspect there of the acknowledgment I wanted in the gold-washed green eyes . There would be humor in them . The lips slightly swollen and open , the small warm puff of breath . She 'd giggle to see neither of us was dead and she 'd give me a cracklipped kiss a soft dry kiss with the hot pulp of her lip against mine . She liked to be inside her appetites and her feelings . Whatever they were . One day in a rainstorm I skidded off the road . I was frantically spinning the wheel , I could n't see through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clara was laughing and shrieking like a kid on a carnival ride . We thudded into a ditch . Water softened the canvas top and began to leak through and we sat at a tilt as if in a diving plane , in clouds . I thought we might drown . Then we felt the car rise , somehow the water floated us free , and when the storm passed over , we gently drifted a half mile or so in the flood like some stately barge down a stream . She loved it , she loved every second of it , her fingers gripping my arm , the nails digging into my skin . Sometimes we went out at night walking some main street to a local movie . She liked to stop in a tavern and drink ten-cent beers , she liked the looks she got , the sexual alert that went off every time she walked into a bar or a diner . One time someone came over to the booth and started to talk to her as if I were n't even there . It seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amiable fellow with a foolish grin , but with the strength in him of belonging in this bar , of being known in this bar , this town , he looked down and saw my knife , the tip making an indentation in the blue shirt and the sprung gut . Ile was genuinely astonished , they do n't use knives in hcxmdocks of the Midwest , he hacked off with his palms llp . She had turned pale . " What 's the idea , do you know what you 're  | doing ? " She spoke in a soft urgent whisper leaning toward me over the table . " I do , " I said , " and if you do n't stand up and get your ass moving I 'll do the same to you . " Outside I grabbed her arm . She was in a cold rage but I had the feeling , too , that I had done right , that I had shown her something she wanted to see . " You know something ? " she said as I hurried her along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that ? " I thought they were the first words of love I 'd heard from her . In Dayton , Ohio , I saw in the rear-view mirror the unmistakable professional interest of a traffic cop as we drove away from his intersection . " I have not been smart , " I said . " I suppose my mind has been on other things . " I made a sharp turn into a side street and started looking for the poor part of town . " What 's the matter ? " " A German convertible with bud vases and New York plates . You do n't often see that in these here parts . " She thought awhile . " Is this a hot car ? " " In a manner of speaking . " Soon enough we were going through the dingy sections where the bums were standing on the sidewalks and the garbage spilled into the streets . The Buckeye State Used Cars enterprise looked grim and satisfactorily seedy , I turned in there and commenced a negotiation . The man with his fat dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a car . 1 said that was because it was so expensive they did n't figure anyone could afford it . He said maybe so , but how could he sell a car where you could not get the parts if they broke ? I said nothing ever broke on a car like this . 1 lc said how could he take ownership on a car that had no papers ? I said it was my family 's car and since when did you walk around with papers of your own family 's car ? 11c said why did I want to sell my family 's car ? I said I was running away to get married and needed cash . " How are you  | going to run if you do n't have no car anymore ? " he said . " I 'm going to buy a modest well-tuned vehicle from you , " I said , looking with bright honest earnestness into his face . He walked around the car several times . He glanced at Clara in the front seat , I had told her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiancee , " I said to him softly , " of whom they do n't approve . " I could see him thinking : They would n't go after their own kid . Come with me Combust with me " Someday , " Clara said over the noise , " maybe you 'll be able to buy it back , or one like it . " " What ? " " I said someday you could hope to get it back . " " I 've got my car , " I said , pounding the dashboard . " I 've got papers for it . I 've got a hundred fifty simoleons in my pocket . Is that bad ? We can get to California if we 're careful . " " California ? " " That 's where we 're going . Did n't you know ? " " I was n't informed , " she said , holding on to the leather strap over the door . She peered ahead , frowning . I had taken in partial trade a 1930 Chevrolet station wagon with wood-panel sides that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air every time we hit a bump . It had a high polish on its tan-and-brown body and admitted to fifty thousand miles .  | did n't know dead people were that unusual . I saw them all the time . I wandered around holding my bottle and seeing these dead hunkies lying on tables . I dragged my blanket around behind me . I was n't frightened . My father would smile at me . " When I was older I began to understand things a little more . I thought , for instance , that anyone who was dead had to have a hole in them . I did n't know people died without holes in them . Then I figured it out one day . Some old guy was being dressed who died of natural causes . Ile 'd made it all the way . So I knew then about natural death . " But it was just the business , you know , it was nothing special , we lived in an apartment right over the business I played after school outside in front of the stoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 'd back up into the garage and he and my brother took the body into the back . And that was the way things were on West Twenty-ninth Street . " And then my smother died but my father did n't handle it , someone else from another funeral parlor cane and took her away . Just like doctors do n't treat their own families . But maybe it was because she was religious .  | None of our church got buried with us . We were Greek Orthodox but the business was nondenominational . My father was not highly regarded in church . I saw more Romans and Jewish rabbis at Lukas ' than I did priests . Anyway , my father moped around a long time . He did n't know what to do with me . He hired this black lady to take care of me . She was okay but she drank . She stood at the window whenever there was a funeral downstairs . She 'd count the numbers of cars to see how important the dead guy was . She 'd count the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come look and I began to look too . You 'd see all these flowers in the flower cars , sometimes in three , four cars of flowers , it was too much , like huge mounds of popcorn , I did n't like it . I hate cut flowers . All my life they made a stink coming up through the floor below , there was always somebody downstairs you could smell flowers through the dumbwaiter . " But then if it was really a big affair it would be worth watching . My father and brother all dressed up in their shiny black suits . He 'd hire on men on these days . People coming to pay their respects , filling the parlor , crowds standing out on the street . And then outside all the cars in a line , double-parked with their headlights on , all these black mourners ' cars twice around the block . And the cops would be there checking on who showed up , standing across the street and watching . And the photographers with their big flash cameras taking pictures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a picture of somebody and in the background the canopy said Lukafs ' Funeral Parlor . " But he did n't need the publicity and he did n't care . He was just some dumb hunky , he did n't care about anything , he did n't talk much , he just did this work . And he got this clientele over the years , he was n't in the rackets himself , but he kept his mouth shut and did n't make judgments and he just got to be the one they used . He did n't care who he buried , why should he , the kind of work he did why get excited . After a while he had to expand . He bought the brownstone next door , and put a new streamlined face across both houses . And then there was a showroom and a reception desk . " And I was pretty grown-up now . I would n't stay in school . I 'd worked  | for a while at the five-and-ten just to have something to do . But he was getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to answer the phone who could talk right . So he asked me . So I thought , Why not ? I mean when I was a kid I used to get it at school . That 's why I had no friends at St. Clare 's . They came around at Halloween with sheets on and rang the front bell . Clara Cadaver , Clara Cadaver . Well , shit , I only had boyfriends , anyway . I mean as a kid my friends were boys . I played street hockey . " But anyway , I did n't mind . I wore a black dress . I wore stockings and high-heeled shoes . I had an allowance for the beauty parlor . And that was my job . I got to meet some real people . It was an entree , as they say . What 's that sound ? The engine does n't sound right . " " No , " I said , " it 's okay . Maybe I need a little oil . " " It 's getting dark , anyway  --  where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry ? " " A little . " I had a terrible feeling , a chilled feeling because of her lineage , her criminal lineage , I thought of it as a caste , some kind of contamination she had been born into through no fault of her own and I thought it was mine now too ; if I wanted her , what she was was mine too , what she brought with her we both had now . But I was also happy that she had told me , that in the dreamlife of the road the hours sitting next to each other and facing in the same direction brought things out we might not have otherwise said . We told each other about our lives , we gave each other our lives while we looked at the road backward into ourselves . Even though afterward we did n't remember what we said , or were too proud to admit we remembered . " We lived across the river from each other , you realize that ? We could have shouted at each other across the Hudson , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet ! We saw the same Tom Mix movies . We ran along the sidewalks pointed to the sky at the same airships ! " " What ? " " No , really , playing hockey " ? I wanted to make her smile ? " do n't you  | remember ? Maybe our teams played each other . We made the puck from the end of the wooden cream-cheese box , right ? We wrapped it in black tape , am I right ? " It seemed very important in this moment to make her smile . " Do n't you remember ? Do n't you remember the I cash clothes ' man ? On Twenty-ninth Street ? The water wagon , running alongside it for the spray ? Do n't you remember how we went to the candy store for ice cream ? " " What are you talking about ? " " No , really , Clara . One hot afternoon we bought Dixie cups and stood on the sidewalk in the sun with our wooden spoons . You remember . Licking the ice cream off Joan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put on my coat , closed the door quietly and went out to look around . In addition to everything else snow had hit this burg , a heavy wet fall that stuck to your eyelashes and got into your shoes . The rooming house was highway robbery  --  twelve dollars a week , paid in advance . Restaurants came to another two , three dollars a day . If I took her to the movies , another forty , fifty cents . I had even bought her a gold wedding band  --  for her protection , I said . I had n't told her there was no money to get the valves reground . She thought we were in Jacksontown another day or two at the most . I could manage two day-coach fares to Chicago . But what would we do in Chicago  --  freeze our ass there ? And so , hunched in his khaki coat from the Great War , the big spender wandered through downtown Jacksontown , Indiana  --  Heart of the Hoosier Nation , as the sign said . Everything built of red brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the armory . Stores occupied , the black cars parked at angles against the curbs , he notices the traffic , a heavy traffic rolling  | quietly through the snow , the sky gray , heavy flakes like soundproofing tamping down the horns , muffling the engines , even the streetcars grinding along hushed in the flanges , sparks flaring in the dark afternoon , the dark turrets of the armory the dark green cannon on the lawn with the mantle of white snow . I saw everywhere on every street jalopies of every description , valises and boxes strapped to their fenders , children and grandparents high in the rear seats , scarfs wrapped around their heads . I saw furniture covered with blankets tied with rope on the beds of broken-down trucks . I saw out-ofstate license plates : Kentucky Tennessee Georgia Arkansas Michigan Missouri . I boarded the Railroad Street trolley to see what would happen . It banged its way sharply around corners and picked up speed . Soon it was out of the downtown area barreling between two endless rows of semiattached bungalows , block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a canyon of the sides of buildings , moving slowly now , many men walking in the street , the bell clanged , an unbroken chain-link fence blurred my eyes , if I opened the window I could touch it . Last stop the doors hissed open at the main gate . Here a crowd of men stood waiting to get in , a quiet intense crowd not orderly but silent . The snow came down . Even as I watched , the crowd grew pulsing like something underwater . Behind the locked gates uniformed men stood chatting as if nothing was going on . I looked up at the block-long sign across the tops of two buildings . BENNETT AUTOBODY NUMBER SIX was what it said . That evening I took Clara to dinner at the Jacksontown Inn , the best restaurant in town . It had tablecloths , candles , black busboys , and the roast beef au jus went for two dollars and a half . " I see in the paper where every state is covered with snow from here to the Rockies , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her hair beginning to come through , her hair was fluffier too , she had given up the beauty parlor  | she believed they would ruin her if she had her hair done in the Midwest . " Anyway , " I said , " I did a little exploring while you were having a nap . We could be in worse places . There are jobs here , people have money in their pockets , they 're shopping in the stores and going to the movies . They have three movie houses downtown . " She cut her roast beef . " And you want to hear something funny ? The big employer and why everything is humming is your friend and mine Frankie W. Bennett . His Number Six plant . " She put down her knife and fork , dabbed at her mouth with her napkin and sat there . " Oh , Clara , " I said . " I 'd be happy if I could just look at you across this table for the rest of my life . " " That would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You did n't wear your gold ring ! " " I forgot . " I ate and drank energetically . " Anyway , " I said , " as long as we 're stuck here  --  so long  --  as we 're here awhile  --  I thought I 'd tap into old Frank ? build up our cash reserve for the run to California . " " What does that mean ? " " Well , they 're hiring at the Number Six plant . " " So ? " A sip of water from my cut-glass goblet . " I caught on there this afternoon . Nothing to it . I just gave them my shining innocent face . I mean there were these guys standing around with their toolboxes and employment records all wanting the same dumb unskilled jobs I put in for . No contest . " " Why ? " ? " Because it was obvious I did n't have a union background . They do n't want someone who 's a wiseass . They want the ones who do n't know any better . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I thought I explained , " I said . " I thought I explained that . " She did n't say anything , we resumed dining , Occasionally she 'd look up  | and smile sweetly at me , in the silence there at the Jacksontown Inn the unarguable terror of things was driven home to me . " I do n't see why you should get on your high horse , " I said . " Is it any worse than sleeping in his bed ? Is it any worse than stealing his car ? " " I think I 've got to leave now . " She stood . " Do you mind if I pay the damn check ? " We walked through the snow back to the room . I grabbed her elbow , she shrugged me off . " Clara , for God 's sake , what is it I 've done , after all ? I got a job ! A job ! Is it a fucking crime to get a job ? There 's no money ! We 're here in the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no money ! " In the room she started to pack . I willed myself to be calm , there were other roomers on the same floor , I did n't need landlady trouble on top of everything else . " Clara , please do n't be like this . Please listen . All right , this is the worst shithole town in the frozenest fucking country there is . It 's so fucking cold I ca n't believe how cold it is . And there 's no reason to stay here . Except that it 's Bennett 's ! That 's why , Clara . That is the true reason why . Because I 'm gon na work his line without his knowing and walk away from his machine with my wages in my pocket and he 's going to get us to California ! That 's why . " She was still . " You hear me , Clara ? Because it 's living right under his nose . That 's why . Because it 's the riskiest thing ! It 's the toughest and most dangerous and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the side of the bed . " And what am I supposed to do here all day while you work his line and make your classy wages ? Huh , big boy ? What am I supposed to do ? " My God , it was laughable , it was heartbreaking but at least she asked the question . Neither of us was twenty ! We were children  --  who were we , what chance did we have ? In her question was one half of an instant 's perceiving , dimly appreciated , of only the most obvious possibility of life comprising the history of mankind . I sat on the side of the bed next to her , whispering in her ear , " You do n't realize what you 've done to inc . Mc , the carney kid ! You 're making an honest man of him , it 's horrible . I have all these godawful longings to LOON LAKE 157  | work to support you , to make a life with you , I want us to live together in one place , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's the North Pole , I 'll do any fucking thing to keep you in bonbons and French novels , Clara , and it 's all your fault . " " Oh Jesus , he 's crazy , this boy is crazy . " But I felt this weird tickle-behind-the-spine unprecedented truth of what I was saying . Before I said it I had n't known I felt it : we could change , we could make our lives however we wanted ! And the steps Clara had taken to molldom and to the high forest of Loon Lake were dainty steps , steps avoiding the muck of her reality and mine . And this was where we truly belonged , not on the road but stationary , in one place , working it all out in the hard life . " You got anything better to do ? " I said . She sighed . " That 's the crying shame of it . "  | Data comprising life F. W. Bennett undergoing review .

Countervailing data re his apparent generosity to worthless poet scrounge and likely drunkard Warren Penfield . A hint too of his pride in Lucinda Bailey Bennett 's aviation achievements . A heart too for spunky derelict kids .  | Your register respectfully advises the need for additional countervailing data . History suggests of the class of which Mr. F. W.

You can not observe the bounteous beauty of our country nor take pleasure in its most ordinary institutions in peace and safety without acknowledging the extraordinary achievement of American civilization .

Drive down the turnpike past the pretty painted pipes of the oil refineries and no one will hurt you .  | No claim for the perfection of F. W. Bennett , only that like all men he was of his generation and reflected his times in his person . We know that by the nineteen-fifties at an advanced age he had come finally to see unions as partners in enterprise and to cooperate fully on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course at that age he only drove a ball twenty or thirty yards but they called him Mr. Frank and with humor admired his sportif outfits the beige-yellow slacks the brown-and-white shoes with the tassels the Hawaiian shirt with his breasts showing .

I cite too the ordinary fears of mortality the inspection of a fast-growing mole on the side of the nose blood in the stool a painful injury or the mournful witness of the slow death of a parent all this is given to all men as well as the starting awake in the nether hours of the night from such glutinous nightmare that one 's self name relationships nationality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asiatically you do n't even know the idea human it is such a low hour of the night and he shares that with all of us . I therefore declare F. W. Bennett to embody the fullness of the perplexity of living , as they say . I cite here his voice which people who knew him only in his later years believed to he ridden and cracked with his age but in fact his voice had always been rather high reedy  | with a gravelly consistency around its edges and some people found this menacing but others thought it avuncular especially after his operation for cataracts when they wear those goggle glasses . But it was one of those voices of such individual character that people who never heard it can imagine it just by the mention of his name and those standing in the great crush of honors at his funeral could believe themselves likely to hear it for many years afterward as if a man of this strong presence could not release his hold on life except very very slowly and , buried or not , manifest a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | was on headlights . First I attached with four screws two metal frames the screws lay in a bin the frames met at the convergence of two small belts the left frame from the left belt the right down the line . Sometimes the pieces did n't match , sometimes the wrong piece came down the wrong side and sometimes , the thread not being true , I had to hammer the screws in , everybody did . Next I affixed the crossed pieces to the inside of a curl of tin shaped like a flowerpot . I then inserted through a hole in the pot about four feet of insulated wire that came to hand dangling from a big spool overhead . I snipped the wire with a pair of shears , knotted the wire so it would n't slip and put the whole thing back on the line for the next man , who did the electrical connections , slapped on the chrome and sent it on to the main line for mounting on a fender . That was the operation it 's what I did . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung open like bins and the sun Caine through the meshed glass already broken clown , each element of light attached to its own atom of dust and there was no light  | except on the dust and between was black space , like the night around stars . Mr. Autobody Bennett was a big man who could do that to light , make the universe punch in like the rest of us . And all around me the noise of running machines , conveyor belts , the creaking of pulleys , screeching of worked metal , shouts , the great gongs of autobodies on the line , the blast of acetylene riveting , the rattling of moving treads , the cries of mistakes and mysterious intentions . And then continuously multiplied the same sounds repeated compounded by echoes . An interesting philosophical problem : I did n't know at any moment what I heard was what was happening or what had already happened . It was enough to make me think of my father . The man was a fucking hero . Then they speed things up and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wrong side of the belt the guy there is throwing tires on wheel rims and giving the tubes a pump or two of air he ignores my shouts he ca n't take the time . And then the foreman is coming down the line to pay me a call I ca n't hear him but I do n't have to  --  a red bulging neck of rage . And then they stop coddling us and throw the throttle to full and this is how I handle it : I am Fred Astaire in top hat and tails tossing up the screws into the holes , bouncing the frames on the floor and catching them in my top hat of tin . I twirl the headlight kick it on the belt with a backward flip of my heel . I never stop moving and when the belt is too slow for me I jump up and stomp it along faster , my arms outstretched . Soon everyone in the plant has picked up on my routine  --  everyone is dancing ! The foreman comes pirouetting along , putting stars next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steel rafter by insulated wire to dance backward on the moving parade of car bodies , Mr. Bennett himself in white tie and tails . He 's singing with a smile , he 's flinging money from his hands like stardust . Shit , how many more hours of this ... I thought of Clara I thought of us driving to California in the spring . And then I thought , What if she just left , what if she met someone and said to him , //ow do l get out of here  | And then I resolved not to think at all , if I could n't think well of Clara , I 'd turn my mind from her knowing I was racked , knowing I could n't physically feel hope in this hammering noise . But I did n't have to try not to think , by the middle of the afternoon my bones were vibrating like tuning forks . And so it had me , Bennett Autobody , just where it wanted me and I was screwed to the machines taking their form a mile away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by bit from our life and the gift of opposition of thumb and forefinger , those precious vehicles , each one a hearse . On the other hand everyone had the same problem I heard stories of people hauling off on a foreman , or pissing on the cars , or taking a sledge hammer to them , good stories , wonderful stories , probably not true . But the telling of them was important . I was the youngest on my line , jokes were made about that  --  what a woman could still hope for from someone my age . Jokes were important . The line was a complex society with standards of conduct honor serious moral judgment . You did your work but did n't kiss ass , you stood up for yourself when you had to but did n't whine or complain , you kept your eyes open and your mouth shut , you did n't make outlandish claims brag threaten . Yet none of this was visible when we pressed through the gates in the evening , a nameless faceless surge of men in soft caps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the street of the endless two-family bungalows . I had my choice  --  to take the streetcar , which was faster , or walk and save the carfare . I ran . I stopped only long enough to pick up a movie magazine or True Confessions , I liked to bring her small surprises keep her busy keep her occupied . Sometimes I 'd find her waiting at the window looking out the window ? the dark industrial sky , the great bobbing crowd of men flowing down Railroad Street making a whispering sound on the cobblestones like some dry Midwestern sea  --  and she 'd be holding her arms , the bleak mass life  | scared her as some elemental force she had n't known , not even realized by the way she stood and watched that she gave it her deference . We ate things heated from cans . We had two plates two cups two spoons two knives two forks . Our mansion was furnished army-camp fashion by the company . Behind the back porch was the outhouse . We stayed in the kitchen till bedtime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seemed to be enough . Clara sat reading , she wore her fur jacket she wore it all the time . She was fair and could n't take the cold , the winter had done something to her face , coarsened it , rubbed the glamour from it . Five minutes out of doors her eyes watered , her cheeks flamed up . She did n't use make-up anymore . All of it was all right with me . I still could n't take my eyes off her . I tried to remember the insolent girl with the wineglass in her hand and the firelight in her eyes . " I 'm glad you 're laughing , " she said . I had a scheme for getting us from kitchen to bed . I heated water in the black coffee pot and then ran the pot like a hot iron over the mattress . I undressed her under the covers . I loved it cold , I loved the way she came to me when it was cold , as if she could n't get close enough . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she put her arm on my shoulder and said Shhh . " You hear that ? " she said . " What ? " " Next door . They 've got a radio . " I lay on my back and listened . I heard the wind blowing the snow in gusts along Railroad Street . Sometimes the snow came in through the cracks and in the morning you 'd find it lying like dirt inside the front door . " I do n't hear anything , " I said . " Listen . " And then I heard it , very softly through the wall , it was dance music , the swing band of a warmer world , it made me think of men and women on a terrace under a full moon .  | heir place  --  the mirror of our three rooms  --  astounds me . No trace of company domicile , it 's all been washed from the walls and strained from the light coming in off the street . We sit on stuffed horsehair chairs , there is a matching sofa , behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deco design . A braided rug covers the parlor floor and glass curtains adorn the windows . Amazing . On the desk in the corner a private phone . Who would have thought people on Railroad Street had their own phones ? The subtle giving to the newcomers of their protection . Lyle James smiles sitting on the sofa with his hands on his overalled knees , he 's one of those crackers , hair like steel wool , reddish going to gray , a face of freckles so that he appears to be behind them looking from his pink-lidded eyes through them as from some prison of his own innocence , buckteeth smiling . What does he see ? In Jacksontown , crossroads of the world , he thinks he 'll see everything given enough time . These two arc just getting their legs , the boy looking at her as if she 's sick about to die , or have a fit , but  | it 's his fit more likely , that 's what 's important to this boy , not how he feels but bow she feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she smokes her cigarettes , crosses her legs , stares at the floor , that 's the way it is with folks from the East . Mrs. James comes in from the kitchen holding a platter with chocolate cake and cups and saucers and napkins . Another freckled-face redhead , but a pretty one with light eyes , a plump mouth sullen in a child , provocative in a woman . Which is she ? She is very shy , blushing when her husband boasts that she baked the cake herself . She wears an unbuttoned sweater over her dress , school shoes , ankle socks . We 're all Bennett people , neighbors , fellow workers , this is Clara , hello , this is Sandy , hi , Clara , this is Lyle , this is Joe . They are Southerners , like so many of them here , but with my tenacity , I recognize it , they talk slower but feel the same . He must be thirty-five , a lot older than his wife , crow's-feet under the freckles , they act dumb but I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked to take city slickers . Clara talks to the wife . Clara in this conversation is the older woman from New York , Mrs. James maybe sixteen years old stands in awe of that sophistication . And then a baby is brought out , the child wife has a baby ! The establishment of them sitting modestly for our admiration : people are strong , they prove themselves . You see , Clara ? You can wrest life from a machine and walk away . " ' A course , " he was saying , " all this work ai n't just the season . You would n't know but they was a wildcat strike last summer . Quite a to-do at the main gate . The company brought in strikebreakers . A feller was killed . They closed the plant down , fired everone . Everone ! " I nod , this is man talk . The baby began to cry , the young mother unbuttoned and gave her breast right in the parlor , neither of them made anything of it . I glanced at Clara . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the mother and child . Expressed in Sandy James ' face just that absorption in the task as the doll mother 's in her solemn game . " I started out in trim , " Lyle says . " Now I hang doors . You get a few more cents a hour . I lands do n't cut up so bad , I , enune see your hands , "  | he said . I held them out , swollen paws , a thousand cuts . " Yeah , " he says , " that 's it . " After a while he went over to the radio we had heard , obviously his pride and joy , a Philco console of burled wood big as a jukebox . A circular dial lit up green when he turned it on , it had regular and shortwave broadcasts , and a magic tuning eye like a cat 's green eye with a white pupil that grew narrow when he brought in a station . He had turned it on as casual as he could be and while it warmed up consulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ter , " he said , " seein as you folks 're from New York , " he said to Clara . Yes , they had culture ! We sat in dutiful appreciation and listened . Mrs. James had put her baby back to bed and sat now , a child herself , cross-legged on the floor right in front of the speaker , she wanted to get in there behind the cloth with those people . In the casual grant of their warmth and circumstances we are so installed in the life as to have neighbors , we have started to live in their assumptions . I look at Clara she is way ahead of me , she is wearing her gold band . As the drama crackled through the night the husband displayed enlightenment as to how the sound effects were made . Someone kicked down a door . " They do n't really wreck a door , " he said . " ' At 's just a ordinary vegetable crate they stomp on . Splinters real good . " A horse-drawn carriage . " Shucks , them 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Loll , " his wife said . " I cai n't hear ! " After the program was over he lectured on how they made houses burn , typhoons blow , trees come down . He had us close our eyes and did these things up against our ears to get the effect of amplification . He was good , too , insane , I began to realize , once people got through their courtesy it was their madness they shared . He had heard some Arabian Nights drama about a desert chieftain who skinned his victims alive . " Ah do n't wan na hear this , boll , " his wife said . " Ilold on , honey  --  see , Joe , I could n't figger it out , Ali thought and  | : hought , it was the damnedest thing ! But I got it now , close your eyes a minute , this 'll turn your hair white . " I hear a piteous wail , screams , sinister laughter and the unmistakable tripping off of human skin inch by inch . I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of adhesive tape down the middle . vo , not exactly my type , I would not under ordinary circumstances choose : o associate with Lyle Red James , but I knew when we walked off to work : ogether in the morning Clara would have coffee with his wife , maybe luring the day they 'd go to the grocery store together I saw the child given rom one pair of arms to the other  --  I would listen to a hundred nights ) f radio for that . And at the front gates of the plant every morning a car or two of cops ) arked there , just happening to be there . Not that I thought they were ooking for me but if they were I imagined Red James as my disguise . If he cops were looking at all , it was for a man walking by himself  --  that vas my reasoning . And anyway , what they would have to accomplish to et to this point was n't very likely . They would have first of all to locate vlrs . Lucinda Bennett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid that he vould n't paint it . But even if they did , they would know only that they vere looking for a wooden station wagon registered to clever Joseph Sennett Jr . But even then , how did that get them to Jacksontown , Inliana ? But supposing they were here , they would n't find it anyway , it was , arked off the street behind a garage and under a ton of snow . I probably ould n't find it myself . But supposing they found it , they 'd be on the ) okout for a hobo boy , a loner walking by himself to work in the morning nd not Mr. Joe Paterson loping along step for step with the world 's iggest fucking hayseed . It always proved out to my satisfaction if I thought about it but that id n't stop me from thinking about it again each morning going to the unch clocks under the thousand fists like rifle fire we are going into the . enches and over the top in the barrage of time clocks , I always checked ty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every change in Clara and inc a disguise , nobody who ) ew Clara I.uka &; and was in his right mind would look for her on  | Railroad Street . I liked us having neighbors , yes , and living to the life the same as everyone else , living married , looking like an automobile worker 's family for life , appearing to these people next door as mirrors of themselves , shining in their eyes so they could n't even describe us after we 'd gone . I remember the way Red James walked . He was n't especially tall but he took long stiff-kneed strides , loping along there in the freezing morning while everyone else was hunched up , head bent in the wind , it was something you had to tear to get through , but here was Red , shoulders back , head up out of his collar , the long neck bobbing , and he chattered constantly , made jokes , told stories . " A smart man 'll put beans in his mule 's feedbag . You know why ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress . " " Come on . " " ' Strue ! The fartin moves ' em along . Clocked a mule once sixty miles a hour on a handful of dry beans . Fastern ' ' ese here cars . " That was the kind of thing . He held out his arms ; the snow driving thick like white sheets flapping in your eyes , yelling " Toughen me up , God , usen me up to it ! " And he sang , too , always some damn hillbilly song in that adenoidal tenor of his kind as we went down toward the plant one point of raw color bobbing crowing Hear the mighty eng-ine Hear the lonesome hobos squall . A-goin through the jungle On the Warbash Cannonball ! And at work I found myself hearing his voice in the machines , in the rhythm of the racket , without even knowing it , doing headlight after headlight , I would sing to myself iii Red James ' tenor : keeping time to the pounding racket , I wrnilcl hear the mighty eng-ine , hear the lonesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warbash Cannonball.  | One evening I came out of the gate and somebody tapped me on the shoulder . I turned around , no one was there . When I turned back , Red James was grinning at me . " You comin to the meetin , ai n't ya ? " " What meeting ? " " Union meetin . " " Well , I 'm not a member , Red . " " I know you ai n't . This is a recruitin meetin , anyone 's got the balls . " " Well , I do n't know , " I said . " I never told Clara I would n't be home . " " Boy , the little woman sure has a bolt a you . She 's with Sandy anyways , you come on with me , they 'll figger it out . " So I went along with him to this meeting in some decrepit fraternal lodge a few blocks from the plant . It was up a couple of flights , fifty or so men sitting on camp chairs in a badly lighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we smiled , catching each other out . I thought , Look , if you 're doing the life , do it . I took a seat in the last row . Red had disappeared . The people running the meeting sat at a table in front of the room . I could n't see all of them but they looked like Paterson toughs , they wore buttons or had their union cards stuck in the bands of their hats . I thought as Mr. Bennett was spread out and made into a corporation he may have enlarged , but so did the response , I could n't see anyone in his personal service wearing his green putting a union button on their collar . The meeting began with the pledge of allegiance and then the president rapped the gavel and called on the secretary to read the minutes . Lyle Red James stood up and cleared his throat . " Herewith the o-fishul minutes a the last meetin , " he said in a most formal manner . " As taken by yo Sec'tary Loll Jimes , Bennett Local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " This called up a cheer and a burst of applause from the audience . " Just read the damn minutes , James , " the president said . I had n't known he was a union official , he had sprung it on rue , it was queer , the faintest misgiving , I had thought the deception in our friendship was mine . I tried to think that whole meeting why I was  | bothered , I knew he was a damn clown I had n't understood I was his audience . I wanted to talk to Clara about it when I got home . Anyway , she 'd be interested to know why I was late  --  but something else was on her mind entirely . " Did you know , " she said to me , " Sandy James is all of fifteen years old ? Did you know that ? She got married at thirteen . Can you beat that ? And she does everything , she goes to the store she knows what 's good and what is n't , she takes care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he deserves , washes , shops , cleans , Jesus ! The only thing I have n't seen her do is sew the American flag ! "  | t kind of time was this , a matter of a few weeks , a couple of days , minutes , and this other couple was in us , through us , I could n't remember when we had n't known them and lived next door . In the second war we used to jam each other 's radio signals , occupy the frequency , fill it with power . Clara did n't think much of Red James but she never said no to one of their invitations , she had fixed on young Sandy , in that way she attached to people who interested her , locking on her with all her senses . I sometimes became jealous , actually jealous , I felt ashamed , stupid it was the diversion I had hoped for , it was just what I had counted on , I jammed myself when I saw the way Clara looked at Sandy , watched every move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and she was engaged by it , as by the little baby , the smell of milk and throwup , a bath in a galvanized-tin tub with water made hot on a coal stove , and all the ordinary outcomes of domestic life which presented themselves to her as adventure  --  how could I feel anything except gratitude ! I thought every minute with Sandy James put Clara 's old  | life further behind us , I felt each day working for my benefit I was a banker compounding his interest . In the James kitchen Clara watches Sandy James dry the baby after her bath , the baby in towels on the kitchen table , two lovely heads together and laughing at the small outstretched arms , the gurgling infant , the women laughing with pleasure . I am noticed in the doorway , the heads conspire , the flushed faces , some not quite legible comment between them as they turn and look at me , smiling and giggling in what they know and what I do n't . I liked Sandy myself , I thought of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this child ! I found her attractive especially in the occasional surprised look she gave me , as if she were an aspect of Clara and the current of attraction was stepped up by that . " She was made to have babies , " Clara said to me . " You ca n't see how strong she is because she does n't know anything about clothes , all her things are too big for her , I do n't know where she got them , but when she does n't have anything on you can see how well built she is in the thighs and hips . " Clara 's attentiveness to his wife did not go unnoticed by Red James , when we were all together he did what he could to affirm the universal order of things . One night he brought out his infant girl from their bedroom . Baby Sandy had no diaper or shirt . He held her up in his hand and said , " Looky here , Joe , you see this little darlin between her legs ? You ever see them pitchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , them kissin fish ? Ai n't I right ? Now I got two of em , two lovin women with poontangs just like that ! " This made Sandy James stare at the floor , her face reddening to the roots of her hair . " Lookit ! " he said , laughing . " Colors up like the evenin sun ! " Clara sighed , stubbed out her cigarette and took Sandy and the baby into the other room . Ile one night pours two shot glasses of Old Turkey I do n't know what we 're celebrating does he see Clara 's hand touch Sandy 's hair ? Ile says , " I Icy , y 'll see this here little girl , I kin make her do what I want , laugh , cry , anything , watch He begins to laugh , a silly high-  | pitched little laugh . Sandy ignores him , he jumps around to get in front of her puts his hand over his mouth , tries to keep from laughing , after a minute of his pyrotechnics she ca n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Shh , shh , your gon na wake her Loll , shhh , you 're wakin her up ! , " but he 's really funny and she is laughing now , a child laughing , and in fact I 'm laughing too at the mindlessness of the thing and suddenly he stops , face blank , staring at her puzzled his mouth turns down at the corners a sob comes out of him , he puts his arm up to his eyes , cries pitifully , we know what he is doing so does Sandy but she goes very quiet and asks him quietly to stop , he ignores her , keeps it up , crying to break your heart . " Oh Loll darlin ' , " she says , " you know I cai n't tol'rate that , " and then her eyes screw up , her lower lip protrudes , she is reduced , begins bawling , arm up , fist rubbing her eyes , she has a hole in the underarm of her dress , her red hair . " What I tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ li'l ole thang , look there she 's a-just cryin her heart out ! " and she is , she ca n't stop , he goes to her to comfort her maybe a bit sorry now that he 's done this but she 's furious . He tries to put his arms around her , she brings her leg up sharply , knees him in the groin , stalks off . Red James has to sit down , he takes a deep whistling breath . And that 's when Clara began to laugh .  | In a great dramatic scrawl , full of flourishes : To Joe Herein all my papers , copies of chapbooks , letters , pensees , journals , night thoughts  --  all that is left of me .

It was three o'clock in the morning and the shopkeepers were already unrolling their mats heaving the flimsy boxes of fresh wet seagreens from the beds of trucks pitch-black the Tokyo sky above , Warren looked up as if to pray like a seasick sailor keeping his eye on a fixed point a light in the Oriental heavens channeled by tile roofs the heavens flowing in an orderly manner unlike the progress of the Cord , its headlights flashing the startled faces of the poor Japanese street class taking their morning fish soup hunkering beside small fires in metal drums .

But one day Warren 's reputation was made when a low-level official of the American embassy called and asked him to come by for a chat and it was to see if he would consent to offer his services to certain Japanese diplomats preparing themselves to sail to Washington , D.C. , for an international naval conference cutaway striped coats gray trousers top hats I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was a corporal in the Signal Corps what do I know but the embassy man said we have no choice you 're up on the latest fashions everybody else has been here too long our faces are turning yellow yours is still pink and white like a cherry blossom he laughed and so Warren gave a lecture in recent cultural history in America about which he thought he knew nothing but which from having observed the Japanese he knew by refraction . There is a great liberalizing trend he said because of the Great War and internationalization of taste a sense the old ways must he overthrown and the old beliefs and restrictions are absurd . Young men and women marry because they  | fall in love and sometimes when they fall in love they do n't even marry they live together in defiance of propriety half the point to the way they live is to insult propriety .

Washington under Mr. Harding is the soul of propriety , he spoke slowly so the translators could keep up one word was equivalent to three or four sentences before the word , the word , after the word , the three little words blossomed like a bowl of chrysanthemums Mr. Harding himself is devoted to Bach and Boccherini especially the andantes , and the distinguished audience leaned back in its chairs and the look of impassive disapproval was replaced by the look of impassive approval . Afterward there was a reception and he found himself bowing it was easy quite easy and the embassy man said you missed your calling you should have come into State and he bowed to him too . A junior Japanese diplomat said he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . A Japanese publisher asked him if he did any writing . The same young woman glanced at him . She had a ring on her finger eventually they spoke she spoke of the entire Japanese nation as if they were all servants , making remarks about their character and reliability , she was married to one of the embassy staff . They became friends , Warren had now established within himself those women he was prone to love and those with whom he was most intimate in conversation two separate classes and always he recognized them when they appeared , this young woman was of the second class . Her husband was always busy but they were totally married in spirit in purpose in confidence so that all possibly naughty emanations from her were totally muffled in marriagehood , that was more than all right with Warren they became devoted friends she was a Midwesterner not that smart but in some blind inst inctive way constantly putting him iii touch with just the experiences that provoked his deepest response which then expressed  | what she might have felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meanings of things . She knew he was a poet . She was a prim neat young woman with a slender figure and the most appalling provincial drawbacks she had even found herself a Methodist congregation for Sunday mornings but she methodically introduced him to Japanese civilization . She knew the secret restaurants where you could get the best raw sea bream or salted baby eggplant or bean paste flavored with thrush liver or chrysanthemum petals dipped in lemon vinegar , they went to the shrines he sat in rooms perfectly furnished with no furniture slowly very slowly the authority on Western manners customs and English speech began to see things with a Japanese eye to cherish small things a lovely comb a lacquered bowl a shallow pond with fat orange carp the way some trees looked in their foliage as if tormented by wind or a madwoman having just extended her hair with the pads of her fingers . The young Midwestern wife became the audience for the drama of his life if she had not been there watching and finding it important he might never have changed but found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paternal delusions of the foreign diplomatic community enjoying with a smirk the Japanese discovery of besbol the humor of Adolph Menjou Lillian Gish speaking in ideograms . Instead he began his withdrawal first from the Americans then from the Japanese trying to be like the Americans then from the wide streets of the city in which he shuddered to see men in derbies and rolled umbrellas riding in bicycle cabs , he grew thin and ate no meat he turned sallow and began to look actively for a style of expiation he could manage without self-consciousness but he could n't have been that brave unless someone like the young wife from Minneapolis was there to pay attention . The afternoon before he left on his pilgrimage she took him to the Bunraku puppet theater .

" Sandy looked at me and down at the floor . " Come on , Sandy , for God 's sake , " I said . " To a meetin , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board meeting ? " " I guess . " I did n't argue with her . I motioned to Clara and we went back to our side . The house , banked with snow , was without draught , sealed , like a tomb . I did n't know why but I felt bad , I felt desolate , I did n't care about anything . " Hey , big boy , " Clara said . " Let me see you smile . " Later in our bed I was so huge with love for her it was a kind of mourning sound I made , plunged into my companion . The ceiling light was on . I Ier head was turned from me , her eyes were closed , her knuckles  | were in her teeth , high color spread up from her throat suffusing her face , her ears , this was not my alley cat of gasping contempt raking her nails down my back this was my wife connected to me by the bones of being , oh this clear ecstasy ravage on the skin , reluctance it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Red James , " Will you tell me what 's going on ? , " my voice feeble and complaining . I already knew in this town of thirty thousand the crucial action was at my eyes , I was centered in it , it could not be less clear than something I would read in the newspaper . I was at the fulcrum where the smallest movement signified distant matters of great weight . And he answered wonderfully not as if he had until this moment deceived me but as if I 'd always known and admired him for what he was . " See , Joe , I coulda stayed on , you know ? Hell , I had it so finely made I mighta run for somethin someday in the national . But the client do n't give a hoot fer that . He gets the intelligence and he spooks like a horse in a hurricane . I mean I 'd laugh if I did n't feel like cryin . " We were walking home men everywhere talking in groups LAYOFFS ! in the headlines flyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested we stop in for a drink . We stood in front of a tavern I 'd not been in before , the light in the window was gold and orange , it looked warm in there , I felt I 'd better have sonietliing.  | We sat in a booth in the back under a dip in the patterned ceiling . Behind us was the door to the toilet . We sat in this plywood booth drinking twenty-cent shots with water chasers I smelled the whiskey in my head odor of piss cigarette smoke the sweat of every man in the room . " ' Course I ai n't without choice , they 's a little job at the Republic Steel in Chicago . Ai n't no auto worker in Jacksontown gon na follow me to pull steel in Chicago . An ' ifn there is , just in case , looky here . " He pulled a paper bag from his lunch pail , shook a small bottle uncapped it put a drop of liquid on his right index finger rubbed the liquid into the red hairs on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table : the red hairs were black . " You like that ? " he grinned , my stunned silence , he signaled the bartender for two more . " But hell , I 'm thinkin to drop industrial work . You been to the city of Los Angeleez ? " I shook my head . " Well , they 's a need for operators there . They 's so much messin around what with them movie stars and all , you see , ever good wife needs to make her case sooner or later , if you get my meanin . As does ever good husband . Yessir , they 's opportunity in Los Angeleez . " He was nervous , talking with much careless confidence his glance kept flying up to the room behind me and coming back to me and flying off . It happened in the crowded bar that the lower register of his voice was lost in the babble of the room , so half of what he said I could n't hear , I only saw the trouble he was in enacted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unshaven red hair around the Adam 's apple , the suddenly large teeth threatening to engulf his chin , pale white eyelashes pink-lidded eyes staring through their mask . Joe was suspended , blasted . Gone was the wiseass street kid , gone in love , gone in aspiration , gone in the dazzlement of the whole man , the polished being . " Sec , if the union was smart they would n't never let on they knowed . ' Fake their losses this hand , play for the next , string me along without me knowin and use me against the company and tell me one thing and do another and trick Bennett right out of their shoes . An ' shit , everyone  | woulda made out all around , the union ' cause they knowed ' bout me , the company still thinkin they had their inside op , and me still drawin my pay in good faith and doin my work . " He slumped against the back of the booth . " Hell , it 's all the same anyways , the boys 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't matter , the company'lI just hike their prices , everthin 'll be the same . But you see , they let me know they know and the company knows they know and I 'm not good to anyone anymore leastwise to myself and now I got ta take that poor chile and move her out of her home . " " Red , it is so weird ! You recruited me ! " " I surely did . I brought in numbers a good men an ' true . " " Let me ask you , does Sandy know ? " " What , about me bein a detective ? Aw , Joe , " he said with a grin , " the poor chile has so much of a man in me already did I tell her the whole truth she 'd go out of her natural mind with love ! " It now occurred to me to ask why I had been told . I was at the point of perceiving his peculiar genius , which was to make a lie even of the truth . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as two men arrived at the table . " Set yourself down ! " Red greeted them . One slid in beside me , the other beside Red . I had never seen them before . They were heavy middle-aged men , one wore a suit and tie and coat with the collar turned up , the other had on a lumber jacket and a blue knit cap . " See , " Red said to them without any preamble , " I ai n't sayin I did n't make a mistake . I do n't want you to think that , whatever happens . " " That 's all right , Mr. James , " the one in the overcoat said . He was sitting next to me . He pointed at me with his thumb . " And this is him ? " " My good friend and neighbor Mr. Paterson , " Lyle Red James said . " I see , " the man in the overcoat said . He twisted in his seat and leaned back to look at me . The fellow across from him pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding the cap in his fists . I lc was a white-haired man and his florid face was covered with gray stubble . Ile now spoke , his eyes lowered . " James , " he said , " there is a particular place in hell , in fact its innermost  | heart , where reside for eternity the tormented souls of men of your sort . They freeze and burn at the same time , their skin is excoriated in sulfurous pools of their accumulated shit , the tentacles of foul slimy creatures drag them under to drink of it . This region is presided over by Judas Iscariot . You know the name , I trust . " Red began to laugh . " Aw , come on , " he said , incredulous , " that ai n't no kind of talk . " Then this man with the cap in his hands turned to Red and looked at him . I saw tears in his eyes . " On behalf of every workingman who has gone down under the club or been shot in the back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have mercy on my soul , I will go to hell too , but it 'll be a joyful thing if I can hear your screams and moans of useless contrition from now till the end of time . " " Hey , brother , " Red James said , " come on now , you ai n't even tried to see if I 'm tellin the truth . That ai n't exactly fair ! " Both men had risen . The man with the blue knit cap leaned over and spit in Red 's face . The two of them made their way into the crowd and went out the door . Red was impassive . He splashed some water from his glass onto his handkerchief and washed himself . He glanced at me . " Catholic fellers , " he said . A few minutes later we left the bar . My blood was lit with two whiskeys , and with the imagery of sin and death in my brain I wanted to ask him more questions  --  questions ! ? as if I did n't already know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spell it out for me please ! Clara , I still had time , there was still time for me to get her and throw our things in a bag and get us the hell out of there . Instead I walked with Red James down Railroad Street in this peculiar identification I made with him , as if only he could guard me from what I had to fear from him , and on Railroad Street where it made a sharp turn there was a shortcut across an empty lot the moon was out and going across this terrain Red glanced at mile as I tried to phrase my questions he looked at me with genuine curiosity , as if , with all his figuring he had not figured me to he , in this outcome , that stupid And we went across the snow moon of the frigid night making our way to our joined homes and fates as if nothing had  | happened and two ordinary workers had only stopped for a drink in the time-honored way . He was singing now in his nasal tenor the ritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a hundred coaches long You can hear the whistle blow nine hundred miles Ohh-oh me , ohh-oh my You can hear the whistle blow nine hundred miles .  | Pt one point the police asked me if I knew who it was . I shook my head . " I never even saw them , " I said . This technically was true . But I thought I knew them anyway . I recognized the sentiment . I heard in the furious contention the curses of my own kind . Swaying and tumbling all together , we were one being in the snow , one self-reproaching self-punishing being . The police wore their blue tunics over sweaters . Their hips were made ponderous by all the belts and holsters and cuffs and sticks hanging from them . They were tough and stupid , there were four of them in the hospital emergency room , four cops writing their reports on pads wound with rubber bands . Then the reporter arrived from the local paper , a thin small man in a Mackinaw and fedora , and he asked them if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell it had not occurred to them to look . When Clara got there with Sandy I was lying on a table in one of the treatment r ( xm-s and on the table next to inc was the body . I think I 'd been given something before they set my arm because I saw Sandy 's  | stunned very white face but I did n't hear the sound she made . The attendant pulled away the sheet the lips were curled back from the teeth like he was grinning and Sandy passed out . Clara , who was holding the baby , grabbed Sandy 's arm and kept her from falling while the attendant ran for the smelling salts . I thought it was still Red making her do whatever he wanted . Sometime later I had a chance to talk to Clara for a minute . " He was a company op , " I said . She shook her head . " The poor dumb galoot . " " None of this had anything to do with us , " I said , " and I danced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk this way . I looked in her eyes for the judgment and not finding it tried to put it there by talking this way . She touched her fingers to my lips . " He could n't have been placed better , " I said . " It was a secret strike plan , nobody knew except the officers . And then the company took out half the machines . " " Some men came to their house this afternoon , " she said . " What ? " " Just when it was getting dark . We happened to be on our side . At first Sandy thought it was the radio , that she left it on . " " Did you get a look at them ? " " I did n't want to . I heard what they were doing . They tore the place apart . " " Jesus . " " It 's lousy that she got hit with all this , " she said . " Well , now I know why they did n't believe him . " " What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , it 's all right , I 'm doped up . I 'm saying he was trying to pin it on me . I guess he could n't think of anything better . " " What ? " " But they were n't buying it because they must have got into his files . " I found myself panting in the effort to speak . I was having trouble catching my breath . At this moment I saw in Clara 's calm regard the disinterested tinder-  | standing of a beat-up face  --  as if nothing I had to say was as expressive as the condition I was in . " He tried to make me the fink , " I said . I realized I was crying . " The son of a bitch . The goddamn hillbilly son of a bitch ! " She turned away . I stayed that night in the hospital and once or twice I realized the moans on the ward were my own . In the morning I caught a glimpse of myself in the metal mirror of the bathroom  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beauty of a shiner . I found myself pissing blood . I was released  --  I supposed on the grounds that I was still breathing . I walked a couple of blocks to the car line . A clear cold morning . I sat in the streetcar as it gradually was engulfed in the tide of men walking to work . I thought of trying to work the line with a broken arm . I was out of a job . Men stepped aside to let the streetcar through . Faces looked up at me . I had pretended to be one of them . That was the detective 's sin . When I got home I found Clara and Sandy James and the baby asleep in my bed . The house was cold and there was a fetid smell , faintly redolent of throw-up or death , it was a very personal smell of mourning or despair . I got the fire going in the coal stove  --  I was learning with each passing moment the surprises of a one-armed life . I went next door . The place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , the sofa cushions and chair cushions were piled up , the braided rug was thrown back , his collection of pulp magazines was tossed everywhere . His secretarial ledgers were on the floor , one with the names and addresses of the membership , another with his meeting minutes . I found boxes of mimeographed form letters , a loose-leaf folder with directives of the National Labor Relations Board , a scattered pack of blank union cards . Inside the splintered front door , stuck in a crack , was the carbon copy of a handwritten memo dated some months before . It had been stepped
