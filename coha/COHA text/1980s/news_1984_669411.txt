During the first weeks of November , temperatures are frequently in the 70s , days often sunny . By then , the hills surrounding Kyoto have turned crimson and gold and some of this ancient city ' s famous gardens , renowned for their foliage , are at their best . Though nature ' s schedule for the turning of leaves varies slightly from year to year , the display usually peaks by the end of the first week in November. // Peak foliage only adds to the grandeur of the 70-acre Shugakuin Imperial Villa estate in the foothills northeast of Kyoto . Shugakuin has three separate gardens , but the Upper Villa , a large 17th-century " stroll garden , " reached through rice fields and long vistas of 100-year-old clipped pines , offers Kyoto ' s most spectacular autumn views. // Roughly a 20-minute walk south of Shugakuin is Manshu-in , a Buddhist temple garden equally impressive , but in a different way . A **28;29289; Kaesansui , <> or " garden with waterless pond , " this small enclosure of white sand with two " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewed from inside a building. // In late afternoon , the crowds have gone , and the **28;29319; shoin <> ( the building from which the garden is viewed ) is practically deserted , except for a woman in a kimono and a young girl seated , talking . The white sand pond is luminescent , like the sea at dusk. // The Buddhist temple of Shisendo is a 15-minute walk south of Manshu-in , past country houses and small hillside farms . Shisendo , which is a **28;29349; Yari-mizu , <> or " stroll garden with running water , " also was laid out in the 17th century. // Shisendo is small and very popular and is likely to be crowded on balmy autumn days . On Sundays the sea of sand that surrounds the " islands " of the lower garden is often so packed that only by mutual consent is movement and photography possible. // Crowds are practically a given in most gardens , except those like Shugakuin and the 19-acre stroll garden of Sento Palace , renowned for the maple and ginkgo woods surrounding its ponds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guided tours arranged through the agency control the number of visitors. // If crowds are a given , there is one temple compound that is actually enhanced by its popularity . On Sundays the extensive Tofukuji Temple complex in south-east Kyoto takes on a festive air . Small armies of laughing , uniformed schoolchildren with yellow caps on their heads are led by monitors bearing red flags . With them are hundreds of families whose toddlers are attired in colorful outfits. // The natural valley that runs through Tofukuji is renowned for its colorful maples . As one walks from temples to subtemple , across the three bridges that span the valley , the scenic gorge can be viewed from different vantage points , the uppermost providing a vivid panorama of the festivities below. // There are several gardens well worth a visit here , though many Japanese seem to spend much of the afternoon treading well-worn hillside paths deep in maple leaves and photographing each other. // Tofukuji-Fundain Temple has a dry-landscape garden said to have been laid out in the 15th century by Sesshu , a renowned painter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The last major garden is Tofukuji Hojo , or the Chief Abbot ' s Chamber . Actually this comprises four types of dry garden surrounding the abbot ' s quarters. // After paying 200 yen ( about 83 cents ) to enter the reception hall of the Hojo , you trade your shoes for a pair of strangely voluminous brown plastic scuffs , and then you spend a few moments viewing the rooms along the corridor . This helps prepare you to view the gardens . To your left , after you leave the darkness of the corridor , is the sand and rock composition by Mirei Shigemore , one of this century ' s major Japanese designers . Designed in 1939 , this small rectangular-walled garden was intended to be viewed from the long porch of the abbot ' s reception hall , built in 1236. // Unlike many Zen landscapes that recreate the essence of a natural scene , this garden ' s spirit is one of power , evolved from the complex intellectual theme of the temple ' s history. // On a sea of raked gravel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and expnding lines of raked gravel circle like eddies around rocks in the sea . With each step along the veranda , the angles and relationships between the stones change , revealing a complexity interesting to Westerners accustomed to gardens full of flowers , paths , and trees. // By late afternoon , the valley of maples is deep in shadow , the air chilly and pungent with smoke , and the bridge toward Kyoto almost empty . On the far side of the bridge , the roasters and sellers of chestnuts are still there. // An old woman , hair sprinkled with ashes like faded glitter , is selling yet , her apron full of blackened chestnuts . Her hands are sooty after a long day of wrapping chestnuts in white paper envelopes for autumn revelers . But she smiles , and , with simple grace , presents what may be her 2 , 000th envelope as if it were her first. // The chestnut shells are brittle and the meat sweet and dry as the paper envelope warms my cold hands . As I walk toward the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair , the last few stragglers smiling at each other and lifting tired children into their arms. // Before you go : Contact the Japanese National Tourist Organization , 630 Fifth Avenue , New York , N.Y. 10011 ; tel.
