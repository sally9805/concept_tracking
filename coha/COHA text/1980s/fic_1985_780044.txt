 | them . But she would be writing about the work . Menstrual cycles , hysterectomies  --  she had n't dreamed of including anything like that . Of course she was interested in Caroline 's life , because she loved the painting . Without it , Caroline would have been simply another unhappy woman of a certain period who had made more mistakes than most . But that was n't quite right , she knew ; that was n't quite all of it . There was that hunger that she felt , that women felt , to know details : where women stood in relation to their families , as daughters , sisters , mothers . It was n't just ; it was n't creditable . Yet one wanted to know , when the women had accomplished something . Whom did they love in relation to their bodies ? Whom were they connected to by blood ?

As if a life were a trick , making doves fly out of a hat , turning an egg into a flower . Stupidly , like the watchers of soap operas , people who were interested in the achievements of women wanted the grossest facts : Whom did they sleep with ? Did they have any babies ? Were their fathers kind to them , cruel to them ? Did they obey or go against their mothers ? Infantile questions , yet one felt one had to know . It gave courage , somehow . One wanted to believe that the price was not impossible for these accomplished women , that there were fathers , husbands , babies , beautifully flourishing beside the beautiful work .

It was more than that , a beauty that had somehow ceased appearing in young women . Was it that they were thinner , wore fewer clothes , cut their hair short or left it hanging ? Yet Ben had talked about Jane 's hair as if it had been deliberately and carefully acquired , an original possession , rare , trouve . Chestnut , he had said , and one must think of t he silky shell of a chestnut , smooth and polished and resistant to the lips . She was a large woman , Ben had said , she had a quite exhausting encrgv . Knowing herself to be beautiful , understanding that she was from the simple fact of her physical existence craved by people , she did n't worry if people liked her .

People had n't interested her much when she was young . Except her mother-in-law . They would come to parties and speak only to each other . Cut from the same cloth you might say , Ben had said . " And what about Stephen ? " Anne had asked . " Poor old Steve . He was one of those disappearing types . On your own with him he could become invisible . And with his mother and then Jane , he was entirely blotted out . " " And yet you 're fond of Jane . " " Immensely . " " She sounds so daunting . " " Yes , well , naturally . She 's like a swim in a rough ocean . Nothing more exhilarating . Nothing has ever given me the sense of human possibility like an afternoon with Jane . " " All the same I 'm frightened .

" " What if Caroline were alive ? " Ben smiled . " She would n't let you near her . " Jane was standing in front of the restaurant when Anne approached her , introducing herself . " I 've been looking forward to meeting you , " Jane said , smiling formally . There was nothing of the personal about that smile . It was the well-used instrument of a woman who for years has known her power . And Jane Watson stopped the smile , shut it down really , at the first moment it was imaginably civil to do so . Then she used her hand to shield her eyes so that she need n't squint as she looked up the street . " It 's unlike Ben to be late , " Jane said . It was unfortunate , Anne t Bought , how obvious she made her wish , both their wish , for Ben to come to their rescue . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ben would have walked . " " Of course , " Anne said , feeling the point Jane meant to make : she knew lien better , longer . Anne need n't imagine an equality that was n't there . " Ben has known you a long time , I gather . How clever of him to have pulled you out of the hat for this , " said Jane . The comparison made Anne uneasy ; it was too apt . A rabbit in a hat . She had felt like t hat : foolish , white , vulnerable , blinking her eyes at the light And then there was the audience , the strangers , who would applaud  | or hiss or not notice . What would happen to her ? Would she have to go back into the hat ? What did the rabbits do between performances ? She did n't have a chance with Jane ; she could see it . Jane had decided she was a fool . " Sorry I 'm late , " Ben said , insincerely , walking up to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a large meal in the middle of the day , and wasting my time in restaurants , which , on the whole , you know I detest . You make it worse by being late , " Jane said crossly . " Yes , darling , I know , you 've better things to do with your time . I , on the other hand , ca n't imagine anything more perfect than a good meal with my two favorite women in the world . " " Nonsense , " Jane said , walking into the restaurant before them . Jane said that they must order lobster . Ben was rolling in money , and besides , it was a tradition for them : they always ordered lobster for their first meal together in America . She ordered for the three of them ; she chose the wine . When the waiter approached with their lobsters , she set to with an enthusiasm which , had she not had those light eyes , that straight back , that thick white hair , that perfectly formed head , might almost have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scraps of meat ; she cracked the claws with one swift movement ; she ruthlessly bent the back , then poked the tail meat through with a cheerful and expert energy . She accused Ben and Anne of leaving half the good untouched ; she took off their plates all they had thought inedible . The food made her kinder . Pleasantly , she turned to Anne and said , " Now , what do you want to know about Caroline , " dismissing as impossible the waiter 's offer of dessert . The question came too suddenly : there was no lead-up . There had been the first near-rudeness , then the food , then Jane had gone straight to the matter : it was , after all , why they were there . She had leapt up to the high place that they all , really , had their eye on . But for herself , Anne knew she had wanted a slow , gradual climb . Now there was Jane , at the top of the precipice , challenging , her hands on her hips , planting her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask , because sitting across from her , still wearing a paper bib with a picture of a lobster printed on it , was a woman whose identity was so complex that it could only baffle her . Jane had known Caroline ; she had loved her ; she was her daughter-in-law . She and Caroline had built devotion on the usual ground of discord , on the ancient territory of blood feud . It was always odd to reconstruct the relations of the living and the dead ; there was something brutal and unreal about it , but with Jane and Caroline the strangeness was more pronounced , for Anne 's own  | relation to Caroline was singular . It ought to have been the same relation she had to Cassatt and Eakins when she was doing her thesis ; she was a kind of servant to the work , she was supposed to reveal things , restore things . But now , like a servant whose value might be inestimable , or whose obsession might render her useless , she had fallen in love with her charge . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been Mary Cassatt 's niece , Thomas Eakins ' son ? What would she have felt if she had just lunched with Vermeer 's daughter ? It was hard to understand that , outside of the work one was the servant to , the people who had done the work had ordinary lives , ate meals , carried raincoats . One wanted and did not want to believe it ; it was a comfort , of course , to think that beautiful things were created by people like oneself , but it was also a disappointment . And what did the world have the right to know about the eater of the meal , the carrier of the raincoat ? She remembered Jane 's letter ; she was , clearly , not of the school that felt the world had the right to full revelation . How far could one go with a woman like Jane ? What was the intrusion that made the barely open gate shut down on the forward criminal 's impertinent neck ? Anne had to meet the challenge . She had planned for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would ask a question that had nothing to do with the life . " I was wondering if Caroline had ever said anything to you about Grunewald . If she , perhaps , had been to Colmar , to see the Isenheim Altarpiece . " Jane looked at Anne as if she held a smoking gun . " What makes you ask about Griinewald ? " Anne met Jane 's eye . She felt she had to meet it , or everything would be lost . And she felt that she had a right to say what she had said ; it might be wrong , but it was not ridiculous . It was n't a whim , or a feeling . It was an idea . It had solidity even if it was wrong ; it need n't be instantly dissolved by the beam of Jane Watson 's extraordinary personal force . " I got the idea , " she said , " from looking at a series of paintings Caroline did of the crippled woman selling flowers . They made me think of the altarpiece  --  I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to mind . With those paintings she came to a new use of color , a new willingness to distort the figure , a new attention to detail . And I suspected that she was moved by his genius of the depiction of the posture of grief  --  I felt that perhaps she had drawn on it a great deal , beginning in about 1906 , but continuing , really , throughout her career . " For a moment , Anne thought Jane was about to he angry with her . Her eyes seemed to harden , the high , almost masculine forehead constricted ,  | the beautifully cut nostrils flared and closed , her hand went to her forehead . Anne stiffened , as if she expected a blow . " That 's right , " Jane said . " What you say is exactly right . And tremendously good of you to see . No one would think of Griinewald as an influence , but yes , it 's exactly right . She made a trip to Germany in 1905 , and she never forgot what she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I. For years she 'd wanted me to see the Griinewalds , she said seeing them was one of the most important events of her life . " She looked up at Anne ; for the first time , she met Anne 's eye . " We went to Germany in 1930 . Disaster about to be was everywhere , an evil breath . Nazi boys were on the street corners . At the same time , our friends were flourishing , in some doomed way that made one fear . There was a dreadful hectic sickish feeling in the air  --  one simply could n't rest . And then we went up to Colmar , to the Griinewalds . We entered the church . Caroline sat down quickly , very heavily . It was the first time I had to see she was an old woman . " Jane took Anne 's hand . " I believe we are lucky to have you . " She took both Anne 's hands and shook them . It was a strange gesture , an awkward gesture , something one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose you want to know why I 'm selling the paintings now , after all this time , " she went on . " Of course she does , darling , being rational , unlike yourself , " said Ben . Jane 's color rose . " Rational . Send her to that nasty German at the Metropolitan . He was the height of rationality . " " My darling , that was 1954 . " " You see , Mrs. Foster , " Jane said , " as you know , of course , Caroline died in 1938 . Then the war came , and I was in rather a mess about things . I only wanted to do my own work ; I lived in the fourteenth century . I tried not to think about Caroline 's death . The loss was too great . She was like my mother . " " What about your own mother ? " asked Anne boldly . " She played golf , " said Jane . As a mother , Anne heard the sentence as terrible . Would Sarah or Peter one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissive sentence ? " I did n't try to sell any of Caroline 's paintings until 1948 , when the war was well over . By then she had gone out of date . It was all Abstract Expressionism . Caroline was considered an anachronism , an embarrassing one at that . Embarrassing because she was a woman who painted women , children , landscapes . People reacted as if I were offering them clogs painted on china plates . I got so ; angry that after a while I stopped trying . I gave  | several oils to Bryn Mawr ; I gave one to the Metropolitan . That was disgusting . " " Disgusting ? " asked Anne . " The man who was in charge nearly sneered when he took it . I 'll never forget his look when he unrolled the canvas . He said , Spare me lady painters with three names . ' He never hung the painting . Do you know about it ? " " It 's in their archives . I have n't seen it yet . But I expect it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " But , you see , my dear , I resent almost as much people who want to look at Caroline 's work only because she was a woman . She was the greatest painter of the century . She had nothing to learn from anyone . No , you are wrong in that , Anne wanted to say , but looked at her coffee cup . Jane would be bound to be disappointed with what she wrote about Caroline . She would not say : " She was greater than all the Fauves , she had nothing to learn from Matisse , Kandinsky . " That was n't the truth . In range , in breaking through new ground , she was n't the equal of those large men who walked across the twentieth century as if it were Russia . And Anne could n't go along with Jane 's fantasies of her mother-in-law : that she was alone , uninfluenced , unaided . She had had warm and friendly correspondences with Derain and Vlaminck . They were helpful in getting collectors to look at her work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in doing service to the work of this woman whom she honored , she must keep her honor . Perhaps that would mean she and Jane would n't be friends . She had gained Jane 's favor through a judgment Jane thought right ; she knew that she could lose it just as easily . " Enough of this , " said Jane . " This talk about women makes me badtempered . Do you cook , Mrs. Foster ? " " Well , of course , I cook a lot , I have a family . But I do n't know how well . " " This cooking can be a dangerous thing for a woman . I used to tell the people at the college I could n't cook ; I always took people out to dinner when I wanted to entertain them . It worked very well ; it made people think I had resources . You must never cook a meal for your colleagues , my clear ; it makes them imagine a chink in your armor . It makes them think you have too much free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Ben . " I 've had meals from Jane for fifty-five years . " " Yes , but we trusted you . Caroline more than l. "  | " Thank you very much . " " Well , of course , I had reasons she did n't . " " You 've never had a reason to mistrust me . " " Only in the least interesting , least important ways . But we believed you liked women ; we never felt you were trying to prove we were sports of nature for your own comfort . Anyway , Mrs. Foster , will you call me Jane now ? " " And I 'm Anne . " " Anyway , Caroline and I made each other heavenly meals . Then we 'd lie to everyone and say we lived on boiled eggs . Which brings me to my point . Will you come to my house on Long Island for Thanksgiving dinner ? Bring your children . It will free you from the burden of that burdensome meal , and you can look at the paintings I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibit . Ben will be there too , so you need n't be terrified . " Anne was so pleased with the invitation that she began to blush . " We 'd love to come , " she said . " And now , Benedict , what time is it ? " " Two-thirty-five . " " I really must go . I have n't told you all of why I 've decided to sell the paintings . The climate is receptive now , of course . But , you see , we 're quite old , Ben and I. We 'll probably be dead rather soon . And at least if this exhibit happens while we 're alive and nondecrepit , we 'll have some hand in it . Now I 've told you that , I really will leave you . You see what I mean , Ben , this meal 's taken far too long . " She stood up . " Listen , my dear , this is marvelous . We 'll have a wonderful time . I 'll send the letters and the diaries to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Anne 's cheeks , kissed the top of Ben 's head , and walked out of the restaurant . For a moment , Anne was surprised that all the seated people did n't rise and follow her . " We 'll have a wonderful time , " she had said . Anne felt her blood lighten ; her skin tingled ; she wanted to break into a run . Yes , they would have a wonderful time . Jane had said it . She took Ben 's hand and kissed it . " Let 's have dessert , " she said . The waiter brought the pastry cart . Anne took a piece of Black Forest cake , ate it , and called the waiter back for a slice of walnut pie . Licking her fork , she laughed at I3cn , abstemious over espresso . " We 're going to have a wonderful time , " she said , Is if the words were new to her , a foreigner , learning her lust English sentcnr c  | She walked to the Frick , not opening the high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greenish light , inhabited by people with mere leisure . Like a servant , she rang at the side library entrance , a small door cut in the wall , the door to a children 's garden . Having only three hours , she quickly requested the sales catalogues of exhibitions where Caroline 's work had hung , made notes , and checked her information . It was , as an activity , cool , fast and businesslike , but she had wanted that . Her head was hot from wine in the afternoon , which she rarely had , from meeting Jane , who to anyone , she imagined , was like a series of big waves washing over , sometimes overturning , coating the skin with a cool salt . Yet it was different for Anne : Jane was not only herself , she was Anne 's connection to Caroline . And she was the model , the subject , she was the woman in The Striped Dress , in Woman Reading a Letter . In loving those paintings , one somehow was loving her . And she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chaucer , Nazis , her mother-in-law , boiled eggs . It was a relief to sit in this overcrowded room , so bottom-heavy with activity . The earnest , worried , or delighted scholars sat in a horizontal line while above them two-thirds of the room was empty air . And Anne belonged there . She was one of them . The children 's room of the Selby library was small and square and overheated ; the temperature made the children 's complexions look hectic , but they moved in a trance of peace . It was a privilege to be nearly silent there , to look and comment upon books in whispers , to sit at the oak tables turning pages and to smell the smell of paste and crumbling paper . She could n't bear to hurry the children , so she knew she would be late for the appointment Laura had made with the electrician . She would have to apologize , and that would start things off on the wrong foot . But nothing was worth introducing any element that jarred ; she watched their heads bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and must not be disturbed . When she arrived home the electrician 's truck was parked in front of the house . EDWARD CORCORAN , ELECTRICIAN , it said formally , black paint on white metal . She liked the looks of the man who got out . He was a large , heavy man , almost a caricature of a workman  --  only , he was dressed exactly like Peter , in jeans , a red hooded sweatshirt and sneakers that had once been white . The contrast between the two figures heightened , comically , each of t heir natures , Peter so thin , edgy , and electrified , Edward Corcoran so slow moving and massive . I It had thin , incontrollable hair that sprang  | out in patches and wanted to clump . There were wood chips in his hair . Perhaps he had been walking in the woods . Imagining this , Anne was pleased ; she hated to think that the people she did business with had less enjoyable lives than she did . A small boy got out of the truck and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope you do n't mind me bringing my son with me . My wife 's sick , " he said . " Of course . I mean , of course not . Come in . I 'll make some coffee . The children can have juice and cookies . " Edward Corcoran 's son stood slightly behind him , peeping out at people to the right of his father 's thigh . She remembered Peter at that age ; each time she saw a younger child , she felt a sharp joy , then a loss , as if she had seen a beloved place  --  no longer open to her kind  --  in a geographic film . Anne said to the little boy , " These are my children , Peter and Sarah . They can show you the house and their rooms . Or you could stay with your father if you like . " The boy disappeared behind his father . Peter and Sarah went in first . Peter held the door for everyone , as if the occasion called for his best manners . Behind them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had to be businesslike and efficient . She wondered if she had made a mistake . Perhaps she should n't have offered this man coffee until he had looked around the house . The point was , she knew , not to entertain the man , but to get him to give a fair price , do a good job . Michael always did this sort of thing ; she felt on shaky ground ; she felt she could be easily cheated . She saw once more that it was nearly impossible as a woman without a man to act on impulse and feel safe . She decided to speak to Barbara Greenspan . Barbara had recommended him , and Barbara was impossible to cheat . She put the coffee cups in the sink and , showing the man to the basement , walked next door . " I 'm a bit miffed with you , " Barbara said , after agreeing to come over . " It 's been two weeks since I 've had a minute with you . Just the occasional communication from Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulders give once more into the stoop of apology . She loved Barbara , but it was n't always easy , for I3arbara was perennially frustrated and ready to see each of Anne 's victories as an offense . Their friendship had started in the first years she anel Michael liacl lived Ill this house , Anne 's children and Barbara 's were close iii ale , and neither she  | nor Barbara was working . Both could think , lingeringly , resentfully , about their Ph.D . ' s  --  Barbara 's in comparative literature from Stanford was even more useless , they 'd both agreed , than Anne 's . Languorously , inefficiently they 'd lived their mornings , letting the children stay in pajamas while they drank coffee and cleaned , bundling them up for errands or excursions in the afternoon , trading baby-sitting in the evening or hiring one baby-sitter while the four parents went out . Then Anne had got the job at the gallery , and the balance shifted . Resentment took the place of mutual complicity , apology stepped in where partnership had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing : they knew each other 's children intimately ; they could talk to each other about them , respecting each other first as women with good minds . So they got through difficult patches ; they were friends . Anne loved Barbara for her dependable generosity , for her mocking wit , which , she felt , could cut through the haze she often slipped into . It was worth the hostility , because with Barbara she always felt at the edge of something . Barbara hummed with unused power like a machine left to run . She wore her hair long ; it was prematurely gray , and you could see she meant her hair to be defiant , as if her mother had always told her that past a certain age women cut their hair or pinned it up . She applied for every job that came up in the town or at the college and got none of them ; she bristled with hostility at every interview , and even before she got there , the fame of her rough tongue had preceded her . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would go to dental school ; she would become a CPA . She kept saying that she had to do it soon because the median age at which academics left their wives was forty-five and she had only seven years to go with Howard . But no one was more impossible to imagine leaving his wife than Howard Greenspan . Small , four inches shorter than his wife , looking as if he 'd been born in glasses , brought up the only Jew in an Oklahoma town , and a most brilliant mathematician , he thanked fortune every day that a woman like Barbara had seen fit to marry him . He adored his wife , his children . He 'd move in a minute , he said , if she could find a job she liked . But nothing ever seemed worth it to her , and so they simply went on , living in Selby next door to the Fosters . When Anne apologized for her neglect , Barbara said quickly , " Okay , cut the I fester Prynne look . I ca n't stand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealous . " " No , you 're perfectly right . I just need a little rope . " ' I'o hang yourself ? Watch it , you 've been talking to children and idiots  | too much today . Speaking of whom , why do n't you get Laura to sit for all the kids tonight , and Howard and you and Adrian and I will go to a movie . Adrian feels quite abandoned since you 've taken up a productive life . He 's shifted his allegiance to me , and you can imagine what cold comfort that is . Anne hesitated a moment . She had wanted to use the night to read some of Caroline 's letters . But there was Barbara standing in front of her , Barbara whom she had neglected , who was just now doing her a favor , whom she had shared all her time with when time was open , vacant , threatening to swallow them in . She could n't say no to Barbara . She would try to have them all make it an early night and read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late in the morning ; Laura would get the children breakfast . It was the kind of luxury , she knew , that Laura 's presence in the house allowed her . " That would be great , " Anne said . " And think of the wonderful gossip it will create : me out with the beautiful Adrian and my husband thousands of miles away . " " Oh , it wo n't excite gossip . Everyone in town knows Adrian 's type . You 're about fifteen years too old . " She laughed at Barbara as they walked back to the Foster house , but felt unsettled . Did people think of her as no longer young ? Certainly when she was a teenager , people of thirty-eight seemed distant , formidable , immune from romance or real change . But when she was a teenager , thirty-eight year-old women were different . They wore girdles , hats ; the children of their friends called them Mrs. , they did n't own jeans or sit on the floor at parties . In relation to Laura , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of authority behind all her domestic requests . But perhaps Laura thought of her as old . Perhaps young men did . Perhaps even Adrian did . She wondered . She would never dare to ask him . Barbara would , about herself , and he would tell her . But between Anne and Adrian there was a formality , a tenderness protected by restraint . So he would sense her fear and calm her with a compliment . She would n't know the truth . Ed Corcoran came up from the basement , writing figures on a clipboard . He smiled when he saw Barbara . Barbara lowered her eyes , stepped backwards , shifted her weight . Anne had never seen Barbara so off center . Then she understood : Barbara found Ed Corcoran attractive . Anne looked over at hint . I le was nice-looking ; he had nice eyes , nice hands , his air of ; unused puzzlement was likable , and the way he spoke to his son .

" Barbara snatched the paper out of Anne 's hand before she was able to make sense of the numbers . " A very good price , " she said , smiling over the top of the paper like the younger , clever daughter in a movie about Victorian England . Anne looked at the paper . It was a terrible amount of money . She had no way of knowing whether it was fair . But she would hire Ed Corcoran . He was such a nice man ; he brought his son with him , and Barbara would be furious if she asked for an estimate from anybody else .

And she could allow herself a minor and entirely benign stirring of sexual feeling without worry . They would never be lovers , but she could lean against his arm , she could take his hand or playfully embrace him as she could not have done had she not been sexually attracted to him in just this right way . Tonight , she was surprised , though ; the stirring was the slightest degree stronger . Sexual hunger had added an edge to her pleasure so that she could not , as she customarily did with Adrian , quite relax . She was distracted , but having felt this slight disturbance , she was determined not to betray the beat that she felt had been missed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Barbara , not kindly .

She rarely defended herself from Barbara 's attacks , but her friendship with Ben was precious to her in a way that heightened its fragility . She 'd known Ben longer than anyone in her life she still kept up with , except her family . She thought of the time that she had met Ben , eighteen years before , in London . The English summer had seemed strange to her . Strange for it to be July and not to feel the sun at noon with the American insistence that suggests that some appropriate new action , seasonable , transitory , must at that one moment be performed . At home she had never felt totally relaxed in summer .

The other Radcliffe girl who had got the same grant she had , but whose course was on Constable and Turner , had moved out of the mom she had next to Anne 's in the lilhxnusbury  | student hostel . She had met a Lebanese student at the Tate who had invited her to share his flat in Kensington . So she did n't see the other girl again until they sat together on the plane ride home , and the girl , guilty at having deserted Anne for greater luxury , sat silently reading The Fountainhead ( the Lebanese had been studying architecture ) throughout the seven-hour flight . For two weeks Anne spoke to almost no one . The people in her class , also foreigners , were as reticent as she . And she knew after a week that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that imperial restraint , and she was afraid that if she talked too much to her colleagues this would be discovered , and her feeling that she was fraudulently taking money  --  studying something that she had no interest in , that she would never pursue  --  would be exposed . The days were very long , and she often felt that if someone , even a shopkeeper , said a kind word to her , she would burst into tears and beg the person to take her home for supper . Her room at the hostel was bare and anonymous . She bought postcards of the museums she went to and propped them up against the deal-framed mirror , but they did n't help . Her bed was too narrow , the chenille spread had been mended too often , the knobs on her dresser looked menacing if her eyes fell on them in the middle of the night . The evenings were the worst . She did n't have much money , and her meals were paid for at the YWCA on Great Russell Street . But sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trattorie run by Sicilians for spaghetti and a glass of wine . That summer , she read Faulkner  --  it was Absalom , Absalom ! the first two weeks , and she would bring her book with her to the dark restaurant , thinking how grateful she should be for this opportunity . Once a week she went to a movie , often an American film she would never have dreamed of seeing if she were home . But it was comforting to hear the accents , to see New York or Chicago backgrounds . Often she cried at the movies , wondering how she could endure six more weeks of this life , the life her friends were , perhaps at just that moment , envying her for leading . f ler only real pleasure was the reading room at the British Museum . She had been issued a reader 's card because of the course , and every day , after eating her sandwich on a bench in Tavistock Square , she would come back to the museum . Sitting under the high blue dome , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of concentrated attention made her feel attached once more to things ; the smell of the books , the look of the eccentrics  --  the woman who ordered twelve hooks a day on Scottish farm-  | ing and spent her time sleeping on the pile of them , the tiny Indian whose books were all on Jewish history  --  made her feel less marginal . They were young , handsome men and serious-looking women , mostly American , who seemed obsessed with some terribly important work . They wrote things fiercely on index cards and walked with small , frantic steps to the catalogue . They never looked at Anne , and she would n't have thought of trying to catch their eyes ; they were engaged in something essential , and she was merely sitting there , only just legitimately , taking dilatory notes on Roman history and reading a biography of George Eliot . One afternoon , instead of going to the reading room , she went to a gallery that was having a small exhibit of the watercolors of Raoul Dufy . In the large , rectangular room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the silvery green olive trees . She stood in front of one of them and imagined herself in that landscape , imagined the fragrant air , the smell of lemon , of basil , the bright pink streaks of sun in the evening sky . She was interrupted by a voice , shockingly loud , behind her . " Are you at all interested in pictures ? " It was the first personal question that had been addressed to her since she had left America . She turned around to see who had spoken to her . It was a tall man in his late fifties with a large head , light blue eyes and a long thin nose , the kind of nose she had , in her imagination , granted only to Europeans . He told her he had organized the show and walked her around the room , stopping not at every painting , only at the ones he gave her to believe merited her singular attention . He knew everything about the pictures , and about Dufy 's life . For the first time she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a painter , and a painter 's work , as intimate as one was with one 's family . There was no formality in the way this man spoke about the paintings ; he did n't change his voice , as so many of her professors did , he did n't get the glazed look they adopted to indicate reverence . Everything he said was spoken in that same rather embarrassing boom with which he had first addressed her . She thought how unfair it was that people accused Americans of being loud when no tourist could have come near the volume of this man 's voice . But she knew , although she could n't say why , that his loudness was proprietary , rather than unconscious , the loudness born of giving orders , not of shouting over the noise of machinery . She wanted him to go on and on . But they came to the last of the paintings , and he turned to her and said , " Quite enough of that , do n't you think ? " " 01 ) , no , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time since I 've been so happy . " And she began to cry .  | He took her into his office and had his secretary make her a cup of tea . She told him about the girl who had taken up with the Lebanese , about her bedspread , her hatred for the Elgin Marbles , and the greengrocer who would n't speak to her . " What a perfectly wretched little life , " he said . " We must do something about that . " He invited her to dinner . But first , he said , he would show her London . He was always making large insupportable statements like , " London was nothing after the eighteenth century , " and " There 's no sense ordering anything to eat in the West End but an omelette . " He took her to the Wallace Collection , to George Eliot 's house in Cheyne Walk , to Regent 's Park to look at the Nash buildings . Every day they had their sandwiches together . He seemed interested in every part of her life ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her street , the names of her professors and her dog . Early on he had explained about his wife . " We 've no end of respect for each other , but we lead quite separate lives . " Four weeks after she met him , it was time for her to go home . She spent hours wondering how she would do it , how she would declare her love on their final evening . Or perhaps she would wait till she got home and then write him , passionately but with measure . On that last night , he was more than usually talkative . He suggested that she turn in early so she would n't be tired for her flight . He gave her an ivory miniature , a likeness of a fair woman in a low-cut blue dress ; he said it had been in his family since the 178o 's . He kissed her cheek , as he always did ; he told her she must write to him faithfully , must work on her French , must have a wonderful year and have ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said she would work on her French , she would write him , she would miss him very much . She gave him her farewell gift : a collection of Emily Dickinson . It was the only American thing she could think of that seemed good enough for Benedict . Then she embraced him , kissing him shyly just above the collar . " I must say you do make the world warmer and brighter , " he said . She wanted to say , " I am dying with love for you , " but said instead , " Do you really think you 'll have the time to write me back ? " He was going to Paris in September to research his next project , an exhibit of Vuillard . " Of course . Now , you really must turn in , " he said , and headed toward a rank of taxis . Because of Ben , she signed up that fall for a course on nineteenthcentury French literature , where she m et Michael . As soon as she knew she was in love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Ben . Two years later , when she married him , Ben sent them a Georgian silver teapot . It was by far the most valuable gift anyone had given them : she wanted to protect it from the toasters , the irons , the electric knives that sat on her mother 's dining room table , waiting for the ceremony , waiting to be of use . She often wondered if Ben had been in love with her that summer . She understood now , though it had taken her many years to get over feeling grateful to him for his friendship , that she must have been a pleasing companion : she was pretty ; she knew enough about painting that he did n't always have to be explaining himself ; she was cheerful , she laughed at his jokes . But they had seen each other every day ; it was possible to say he was devoted . But had he been in love ? Had he wanted to go to bed with her ? Perhaps he was waiting for a sign from her , a sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could in no way have given . If she had been another kind , she would have been able to express her desire : she might have put her hand on his thigh under the dinner table , she might have closed the door to his office and taken off her blouse , she might have sent him  --  as a student of Michael 's had once done  --  a pair of her underpants in the mail . At the very least , she might have written him an explicit letter . Now , because she had been the kind of twenty-year-old she had been , she would never know . She thought of Laura , who was not much more than twenty now . " What do you and Laura talk about when you have coffee ? " she asked Adrian . " I can hardly imagine a more unlikely combination . " " There 's no such thing as Adrian being an unlikely combination with anything in a skirt , " Barbara said . " There 's nothing like the bitchiness of approaching middle age , " Adrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a loss of estrogen . " Anne looked around the table at her friends . She felt she had n't missed them . In a few weeks ' time , she had changed . Her generosity was less now , and her patience . She felt she barely had time now for these friends ; she felt it was only as a favor to them that she sat there . Was she going to become one of those women who made impossible demands on everyone because they had too much to do ? Perhaps what she had thought of in herself as good nature was only youth , leisure , the need to take and give affection because she lacked the work that could engage her heart . She tried the front door of the house and found it locked . She had told Laura to lock the door if she was alone with the children , although she  | herself never did . She felt that she was safe in the house but Laura was n't . Was it because Laura was younger , a stranger , not connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it because Laura seemed to lack discrimination , that she might let in a killer disguised as a Bible salesman ? Or , Anne wondered , was she making a point : this is my house ; it is not yours . As she sat in the living room , turning the pages of a magazine under a light too low for actual reading , she felt the luxury of Laura 's absence . She could not enjoy any of the rooms in her house if Laura was in them , and for the hundredth time she asked herself why . The girl had done nothing to earn dislike . She had been careful , punctual , dutiful . She had gone out of her way to make the children happy . Anne knew that it was her fault . She sat back and looked at her living room in the insufficient light . Only rarely had she been alone in this room so late . The dark , uncut silence pleased her . The clock that had belonged to her grandmother said twelvethirty . She was not tired . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lights . Thank you , thank you , she said to her things , her furniture . They had soothed her , smoothed the scratches that the day had made , allowed her , in the silent hall , to think of walking into her study comforted , quieted , to turn the light above her desk on fearlessly , knowing the house would close around her and the children , sleeping . In the packet of letters Ben had given her , there were three to Jane and Stephen from Caroline 's apartment in the Rue Jacob , where she had lived from 1920 to 1924 . Anne read the first : Dear Children : I am worried you are not spending enough money , not eating well , that Jane , with her perverse Yankee pride , is spending her days stewing horsemeat on a gas ring when she ought to be in the library . Here is a cheque ; buy yourselves some fruit , some flowers ; pretend you are here in a civilized country , where one expects to eat well as one 's due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health , Jane , which is mine . Of course the two of us could pull a wagon over the prairies after the horses gave out , but we ca n't expect that of the rest of mortals . This reminds me of a story that will amuse you , Jane . A very rich American whose husband 's fortune , I believe , was made in the rendering of lard ( which explains his taste in wives ) stopped by the studio with the view to adding one of mine to her collection . She saw nothing to suit her fastidious tastes ; my mothers and children , she said , looked as if they did n't like one another , and my fruit looked not quite fresh . She kept coming hack to the picture of you in your black Worth suit . " Your  | model , " she said , " is unworthy of her clothes . " " Go on , " I said , " tell me what you mean . What do you make of the model ? " " A peasant , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Watson , you go in for health and strength and all that , but it 's ridiculous to imagine a girl like that in such an elegant getup . " I was interested in letting her hang herself . " Not everyone , " I ventured , " has the same criterion of beauty . " " Yes , but this girl 's beauty is of the coarsest type , " said my guest . Only then did I tell her that the model was my daughter-in-law , that while she was posing she was reading Thucydides in the original , that she was Radcliffe College 's most brilliant student , that the only reason my son was able to win her from the hordes of young men of America 's first families who would have died for her hand was that he stole her from the cradle while the rest of them waited to make their move . The months are slow until I see you . How do you bear it in that barbarous country , and especially the odious Boston which sits on its haunches like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not understand the young . Jane , do not overwork . Perhaps you could pass some of your ambition to your husband . Stephen , are you still trying to paint ? Give it up , it 's a mug 's game . Anne put the letter down and thought of Stephen , of Caroline 's letters to Stephen in comparison to this one . Her letters to her son had been perfunctory and short . None of the pride , the private jokes , the motherly concern , she showered on Jane had come through when she wrote to her son . Whenever Anne thought of Caroline 's treatment of Stephen she came upon a barrier between them that was as profound as one of language . She could speak of her feelings about her children in sentences they themselves might have formulated : they are the most important things in all the world , she could say ; there is no one I care more for . Some deep encoded pattern drew her to her children and made her circle them : her body itself was a divide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could n't imagine Peter or Sarah marrying anyone she would prefer to them , as Caroline had preferred Jane to Stephen . You have done wrong , she always wanted to tell Caroline . Caroline , the ghost who had taken over her life , hovering , accepting worship . She had made Anne feel that veil after veil had been removed ; seeing what Caroline had seen had made her feel she lived on the underside of a wave that furled and revealed treasures . But then she came upon a letter such as this one , which the woman she worshipped had written , iii perfect cruelty , to her son . And she drew back , and the drawing hack made her doubt  | everything she did . Only if she lived with Caroline as a beloved presence could she come close to her in understanding . To do justice to the dead required an intimacy in which justice had no part . So far away they were , and so removed : you needed to embrace them with the unquestioning love with which you embraced an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And even as she wanted to tell Caroline , " You have done wrong , " an anger rose up in her as if the accusation had come from someone else . No one would have pored through a male artist 's letters to his children as she had through Caroline 's to Stephen . It was that Caroline was a woman and had a child and had created art ; because the three could be connected in some grammar , it was as though the pressure to do so were one of logic . Then she wanted to defend Caroline from the accusation she herself had laid against her . What did it matter , she wanted to say to the shivering ghost whom she had left unsheltered . You were a great painter . You did what you had to do . Yet even as she shielded the ghost , she could not still the accusation : " You should not have let your child die young . " For as a mother , she felt it was the most important thing in the world . You did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stephen had died at twenty-eight , miserable , a failure . Yet Jane at seventy-eight was magnificent . The heat of Caroline Watson had come close to both of them , warming one of them , leaving the other ashes . Dead at twenty-eight , Stephen had left nothing . No , she thought , that was n't true . He 'd left his wife and mother to themselves . She had promised the children a walk in the woods . The morning flared , quick , solid , there was no gradualness to the sun 's progress . The sky was flame-blue after dawn , the light , hard-edged at seven , was at nine a sheet of pure and potent color . It was not possible to linger over breakfast , although it was Saturday and that was an established family luxury . Only action could satisfy ; Anne no less than the children yearned to move through the exciting air . Everyone but Laura had a knapsack . The children packed sandwiches and fruit in theirs , convinced of the seriousness of their charge as if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about I , aura 's shoes . She had only sandals , and even with thick socks , they would not be protection enough for the walk with its muddy spots , jumping from stone to stone if the brook was high , tracking through the undergrowth . All through breakfast , Anne worried about Laura 's feet . She could see her sandals , her wool socks caked with mud , twigs and cockleburs sticking to  | them , poking through the cloth into the flesh . By the time she backed the car into the driveway she was convinced that they would have to stop and buy Laura a pair of hiking boots  --  she would need them for the winter anyway . And since the boots were a need that Anne perceived , a concern that Laura would not share ( she was curiously impervious to her own physical comfort ) , Anne saw that she would have to pay for them . She knew it would be frustrating to the children to delay , however briefly , beginning their walk , and so she told them they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health food store three doors down from the shoe shop . She , too , resented the delay , and she knew she would have to work particularly hard not to convey her resentment , not to rush Laura , or to make her feel in any way deficient . It was , after all , admirable to be as unencumbered as Laura was . Had n't Anne often lamented in herself her terrible attachment to things , her almost superstitious need to place herself in the world with heavy objects as if , without them , she might fly off into some unknown , identityless sky ? Every year in the springtime , she tried to make herself give things away . Michael laughed at her agonies , her pitiful show of goods , culled after enormous labor , to give to the Salvation Army . She should admire this girl who was , after all , quite brave in the way she lived her life . But Anne felt herself grow irritated as Laura tried on pair after pair of boots , unable to make a decision , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a basis upon which to choose one over the other . The children had fallen to fighting : they had spilled a bag of sunflower seeds on the floor amid the empty boxes and sheets of tissue paper that lay at Laura 's feet ; the harassed clerk shot Anne a look of pure hatred , which Anne could only accept as just . Laura simply sat there smiling , taking shoes off , putting them on , as if someone had ordered her to kill as much time as possible so as not to arrive too early at a party . Anne felt she had to do something or they would be there all day . " Do n't you think these are the best ? " she said to Laura , pointing to a pair of boots that Laura had tried on more than some of the others . " If that 's what you want , Anne , " said Laura , smiling a smile that Anne found , in the circumstances , incomprehensible . Anger was an emotion Anne had rarely ; when it came , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sensation unusual but not entirely unfamiliar , reported on enough by others so as not to he a shock . She picked the boots up quickly and walked with the clerk to the checkout counter . She had to get away from Laura quickly , so that she would n't say what she wanted to say , " ' ( ' Iris is a favor to you . I am doing you a  | kindness . I get nothing out of this . I 'm giving you my time , my money , for your comfort . How dare you suggest that you 're accommodating me . " She rubbed her forehead , as if she could rid herself of these thoughts by massage . Blindly , she signed the charge slip , not taking in the amount on the bottom line . The children tumbled out of the car like colorful birds . They had forgotten their bad temper ; they ran ahead of Anne and Laura , looking for a spot where they could have their lunch . Seeing them ahead of her , Peter slowing himself down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her like mercury . What nice children she had ! She could take no credit ; they were born with their natures , and their natures were fortunate . That Peter might find life arduous , that Sarah might grow stubborn or vague with age , did nothing to disturb a truth that was lovely : her children were people that she liked . She thought of Stephen Watson , whose existence was a reminder to his mother of the cheat of her sex . Walking beside Laura , she watched her looking up at the sky as if she had been told she ought to see something there . Perhaps it was part of her religious life ; perhaps she thought of the sky as the home of God . Clearly , the girl had no home . She carried her homelessness about with her , an almost ignorable congenital disease , a slight deformation of the spine . That was why she had so much trouble buying the shoes : no one had asked her preference , given her the leisure of her own taste , her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shoulder . " It 's a beautiful day for a walk , " she said . " Here come the children , " Laura said , as if Anne had just been foolish and she wanted to change the subject to protect her . Peter and Sarah hopped with excitement . A tree had fallen down by the creek ; it made a natural bench for the four of them . Peter started a fantasy about all of them taking a camping trip to the Grand Canyon . They would get a trailer , he said  --  some kids in his class lived in a trailer , and it was terrific . It had everything  --  a television , a bathtub  --  and you could just drive anywhere you wanted with your whole house with you . Sarah began to cry . " I miss Daddy , " she said . " If we go on a camping trip to the Grand Canyon and move out of our house into a trailer , will we ever sec Daddy again ? " Peter jumped off the log and sat beside his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the only living people on a ruined ship . Frightened that the vividness of his storytelling had so disturbed her , he offered her one  | of his cupcakes . She took it without humility or gratitude , as if it were her due . Anne watched the two of them , who seemed not to need her . " Daddy will be home before your birthday , " Peter said . " Why do n't you think about your birthday . What kind of cake do you want Mommy to make this year ? " " I want a cake in the shape of a ballerina with pink icing on the skirt . " " I want a cake in the shape of a crocodile . With green icing , and white for the teeth . " " I want a geranium , " Anne said . " Orange icing for the flowers , green for the leaves , and chocolate for the pot . " " What do you want for yours , Laura ? " Peter asked , turning suddenly . " I do n't know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anne said quickly , wanting to temper their exclusion of Laura , " I make cakes in the shape of things for their birthdays . Very crudely , of course . " " I see , " said Laura . " When 's your birthday , Laura ? " Sarah asked . Laura hesitated a moment . " In ten days , " she said . " That 's November twenty-sixth , " Peter said . " The Monday after Thanksgiving . We 'll have a party . Our mom will make you a cake . What kind do you want ? " " Oh , it does n't matter . Maybe some kind of flower . " " How about a daisy ? " Peter said . " Our mother can do that , ca n't you ? " " Sure I can , " said Anne . " I 'm glad this came up . We would n't have known if you had n't told us . " " Oh , it does n't matter , " Laura said . " Of course it does , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthday celebrated . " Anne wondered how long it had been since anyone had celebrated Laura 's birthday . November thirtieth . That would be the day after they got back from Jane 's . She would have an enormous amount to do ; she would want to write her first impressions of the paintings . She saw her workday lost to making a cake in the shape of a daisy . The children were asking Laura what she wanted for her birthday . " Oh , it does n't matter , " she said . " Anything you want . " " We 'll surprise you , " said Peter , pulling Sarah ahead to whisper something to her . Laura sat on the bench , her eyes straight ahead of her , fixed on nothing . Anne wondered if she was trying to keep f Will crying . She felt terrible ; shout her own resentment . She could give up .1 clay 's work , of course she  | could . It would mean so much to this girl who had so little . Once more , Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll tell you what , " she said . " I 'll take you to lunch on your birthday . Just the two of us . " Laura looked up at her . " The two of us ? Alone ? " " No kiddos , " Anne said , laughing . " Oh , Anne , that would be wonderful . " She looked up at Anne with a smile that Anne could find no fault with . For the first time since she 'd known her , Laura seemed genuinely happy .  | he had made that up about the birthday , but it was all right . Because she had been wise as serpents . Had said nothing of the Spirit humming in her like a radio . She was powerful ; her body vibrated like a radio with the sound turned off . The lie was as wise as a serpent . And she was happy . That day in the woods with the children after Anne was angry with her , it had come to her that she must lie . She had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne wanted something from her , but she did not know what . Did not know what to choose or do or say . The heavy shoes lay in their paper , in their boxes , all the same . Which should she choose , and why should she want them ? Anne knew , but it was a test . Anne knew things like that , like Laura 's mother : the right shoes , the right dresses . With her mother there were always tests . Choose . Now you have chosen , you are wrong . You have chosen that dress , those shoes , and now I do not love you . How could she choose ? So much depended on it . Then Anne chose for her . And Anne was angry , angry just like Laura 's mother . The water covered her . She walked through water , falling . She could hear the children talking , see the bright colors of their clothes . Send help , she had prayed , for everything I have is going from me . She was walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taller than she , but beautiful . Her hair shone in the sun like the bright colors of the children . I Icr back was straight . She was a beautiful tree . Laura wanted to touch her , to lean her head on her like a tree , to say , " Please tell Inc what you want , and I will do it . " The danger of Anne was that she made Laura forget the truth . The  | truth that it was Laura who was powerful and Anne who needed her . That day she had forgotten she was powerful . Dropped down in the dark water , she had lost herself . Then she had prayed . And had been rescued . Because the lie came from the Spirit and brought forth a sign . Her birthday was not in November . It was in July . But the children were talking about birthdays . She could hear them through her miserable dark water . First they were saying that their mother made them beautiful cakes , pink , green , and white . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the white paper tablecloth , the candles , the children , the colorful boxes piled in front of the child of honor . So when Sarah , her favorite , asked , " When 's your birthday ? " she could see herself at the table , which , even behind the dark water , shone with beauty . She said , " In ten days . " At first she was frightened . She had not lied much in her life . Even her mother said , " Laura tells the truth because she is n't quick enough to lie . " But it had come to her then that she should lie . And Anne said , " We 'll go out to lunch . " Which was her sign . Which parted the dark waters , lifted her out shining . Anne loved her . Anne wanted her company . Anne wanted them to be together , by themselves , to talk . Anne was her friend . Who wanted to do things to make her happy . Who wanted to take her to restaurants , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . When girls sat in the booths of diners , eating hamburgers together , giggling behind their hands , when girls walked into stores and said to one another , " Oh , buy that , buy that , it 's perfect for you , " she had been the one who looked , who was not with another , who walked up and down the aisles of stores , pressed down , made stupid , made slow with unhappiness . But now Anne was her friend . The kind of friend that she had wanted . Whose looks said , Be with me . You are the one I want to be with . Although she did not need it now . Now that she had the Spirit . Still , she knew Anne loved her . She had won Anne 's love through wisdom . The mistake that she had made with the people in the churches was that she had not been wise . First it was the Reverend Carr , the minister of the church she had always gone to , the First Methodist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice man . She was sure he had liked her , or pretty sure , for that was the time , the terrible time before the Spirit was revealed to her , when she thought no one liked her . But he had praised her for her work for the youth group , praised the embroidered dresser scarves she made for t he bazaar , the cakes she made for the bake sale . Ile had even told her'not her how lucky she was to have a daughter who was so helpful .  | ( Her mother snorted , " At that age I was too interested in boys to be cooking and sewing . Which is why I 'm in the mess I 'm in right now . " ) She had flicked her head at Reverend Carr , and he smiled . She had charmed him . He was no longer thinking about Laura , but about her mother and her small , tanned arms . Laura had gone to him to tell him of the coming of the Spirit , thinking he was a kind man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He put the white tips of his fingers together . He looked at her sadly . " Laura , dear , " he said . He had never called her dear before . She thought for a minute that he was about to praise the Spirit in her , that he knew . But he knew nothing . He looked at her , concern in his stupid eyes . " I 've been wanting to talk to you for a long time . I 've thought for some time that you perhaps were lonely . That you 've kept to yourself too much . And that your mother , wonderful as she is " ? he was thinking of her small , tanned arms , she knew , her dark hair , thick and shining ? " does n't understand you . Sometimes parents , even meaning well ... " She looked at him , smiling . It was a smile she felt come on her when she could see blindness , when she could see people stumbling against truth , when they refused to light the candle that she held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand , " she said . " It has nothing to do with my mother . " She got up to leave . " Laura , dear , " said Reverend Mr. Carr , now standing , " stay and talk awhile . " " No , thank you , " she said . She was proud that she was always polite , in the face of misunderstanding . It was wonderful how , since the Spirit had revealed itself to her , she was never angry . Before , she had been angry so often , at her mother , her sister , her father , the teachers who had been impatient with her thoroughness , her carefulness , who called it slowness , who said she was falling behind . But since the Spirit , she was never angry . When people misunderstood her and she once would have been angry , she could feel herself begin to smile . For the Spirit of Darkness had no strength ; evil had no power over her . She was the chosen of the Lord . Nothing could harm her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Lord had said . " They shall take up serpents ; and if they drink any deadly thing , it shall not hurt them . " Still , for a while , she thought she needed someone else . Not knowing that the Spirit was sufficient for all things , not knowing that she needed no one , that people needed lhcr She went from church to church , talking to strangers of the Spirit ' I'hev suggested she was oscrwrought , that she  | needed a psychiatrist , a rest , a change of diet . She had gone to six churches before she ran into Father Delaney . At first she had been happy , thinking that he understood her . But even he , believing he was shot through with the Spirit , that the power of the Spirit rushed through his veins like his own blood , reached to the tips of his fingers for healing , for the blind to see , the lame to walk ( he had made some rise from their wheelchairs ) , even he was choking on his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been kind to her . At first , not knowing , she was pleased with his indiscriminate embraces . He was a large man , a handsome man , and she had been deceived into finding the warmth of his body a comfort , a solace . Forgetting that all solace was the Spirit 's . Cool and without body . She had seen him at his Healing Masses ( it had upset her mother to see her going to a Catholic church ) , had seen him lift his strong arms , lay his large hands with the reddish-gold hairs ( he called her Red ; he said she was like him ) on the heads of the sick . They raised their arms , they prayed ; some fell down with exhaustion ; some rose up , walked , knelt before him . ( " Not before me , " he would say . " It 's Jesus . " ) A woman she had known from the post office declared she had been cured of cancer . She pitied these people now . The Spirit of Darkness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astray . She began spending all her evenings at Saint Bartholomew 's rectory . She asked Father Delaney if she could have a moment with him . He took her into his office . She admired that room . There was nothing in it but a metal desk , a metal filing cabinet , a crucifix , a telephone , six metal chairs , boxes of index cards of written testimonies of the people who believed they had been helped . He kept them , he said , as proof , for many doubted him . He would not say that he had enemies , but many were against his work . In the next room , she could hear people who were his friends tallying the collection from the Healing Mass , putting coins into wrappers , separating bills . He insisted that the tally from his Mass be kept separately from the other Masses . It was one way , he said , of making friends with the Mammon of Wickedness . Then he threw his head back and laughed , and all his friends laughed with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She told him of the Spirit . I lc smiled . I le put his hands on her head . " Let 's pray about it , that 's the best . " For a while she had been happy with those people . Father Joe told her every week she was a very special person . He embraced her every week and put his warn ' hand on her head when she was leaving . Soon he asked if she would help with the collection tally .  | She had been pleased . Every week she baked things to share with the other people who did the collection , baked special things for Father Joe . When a large check appeared , everyone took it to Father Joe and everyone said , " Praise the Lord . " They ate the cake Laura had baked and praised her , said the Lord had given her special gifts . One old man , who claimed he had been cured by Father Joe of rheumatism , said that if more young girls spent their time like Laura instead of gallivanting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and less time crying . The younger people asked if she would like to join in their guitar group . Singing ministry , they called it . She was grateful , but she said she preferred helping Father Joe count the money . She was very good at it . She was careful ; she was exact . There were never any errors in her tally , as there were with the others . Soon Father Joe put her in charge of the final tally . Some of the women were resentful ; they reminded Father Joe that Laura was n't Catholic . But Father Joe embraced the women and told them that the ways of the Spirit were broad , that there were varieties of gifts , but the One Giver . Soon Laura was tired of the financial ministry . She wanted to help with the Healing Masses . She had seen Father Joe laying his hands on the heads of the sick . She had felt his power . She knew she , too , had that power . She knew that one day she would be beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he healed , healing those whose sickness was beyond him . Father Joe asked if she would have time to do both : to help with the Healing Masses and to work on the tally afterwards . She told him she thought she would . She did n't want him to know that this was all she had , him , the church , the work she did for him . In the daytime , or weekdays , she worked in the knitting store , selling yarns and threads and needles , giving instructions in knitting and needlepoint . But the weekends were empty ; she had nothing to do but stay home , where her parents wished she was not . So she told Father Joe that she was sure she would have time for both the healing and financial ministries . He assigned her to helping the sick to the altar , to making sure they had seats if they could n't stand on the long lines , to getting them drinks of water , taking them to the bathroom . She liked this less than she liked counting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coins in perfect rows , writing the numbers down in black ink on the clean white ledger . The sick people were querulous and talkative . Sometimes they had trouble with their underclothes and did n't get to the bathroom iii time . But she knew she could cure them . She was only waiting For now , she would walk slowly beside them , her  | hand under their elbows , taking one step when she would have taken four , wiping the floor from them , rubbing dry the spots on the backs of their dresses with the church 's paper towels . She developed a friendship with one of the sick women she helped . Mrs. Prendergast was crippled with arthritis . Her spine was bent , so she could not walk straight ahead . She listed like a heavy ship . Her hands , gripping her cane , were knobbed . Mrs. Prendergast had been coming to Father Joe for thirteen months now . He had been able to do nothing for her . This winter had been her worst . Her children refused to take her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles away and said they would no longer give up their Sundays for some smart aleck 's mumbo jumbo . Father Joe asked Laura if she could get Mrs. Prendergast in a taxi ( Mrs. Prendergast would pay , of course ) and bring her to the church on Sundays . He put his arm on her shoulder and told her she was terrific , she was incredible , she was one in a million . She smiled up at him . She thought then that he knew , that the Spirit had spoken to him . Every Sunday for three months she took the bus to Mrs. Prendergast 's , helped her out the door into the taxi . After church , someone else drove her home , since Laura had the collection . But during the week , Laura visited Mrs. Prendergast in the evenings . Mrs. Prendergast said God had sent Laura to her . She showed Laura pictures of herself as a young girl , pictures of her wedding , her babies , her children 's graduations , their weddings , and their children sitting under Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any of this . She was n't really interested in Mrs. Prendergast . Except she knew that she could cure her . One day in the winter when Laura arrived , Mrs. Prendergast was crying . The pain , she said , was terrible , as if her fingers had grown roots , like tree roots in her fingers . She could n't button her clothes ; the top of her dress was open . Laura could see the old skin at the top of her breast , the yellowish slip , the loose pink straps of her bra . Laura buttoned Mrs. Prendergast 's dress for her , and Mrs. Prendergast thanked her . She said just being with Laura made her feel better . When she said that , a jet of flame lit up Laura 's spine , as if a match had been lit at the base . It sent light through her veins , and fire . She felt herself newly powerful . She looked at Mrs. Prendergast . Pain had swollen her features , drained the color from her eyes , turned her skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch . She said they were n't going to church today  | Mrs. Prendergast looked up at her with fear . " I must , " she said . " I need to see Father Joe . " " Father Joe ca n't help you , " said Laura , looking in the woman 's eyes , grown smaller now with pain , with fear . " We 'll pray here . I can help you . " But the Spirit of Darkness entered . When Laura put her hands on the old woman 's head , felt the thin , limp hair under her fingers , she knew she had no power . " You must pray with me , " Laura said firmly . " But you 're not a priest , " the old woman said and began to whimper . The Spirit of Darkness had made her fear . " You have to leave , " said the old woman . " What you 're doing is n't right . " Laura smiled . The Spirit of Darkness had conquered . She was not ready yet ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would sit in pain , go on walking like a twisted animal . She deserved it for her lack of faith . Laura knew she could have cured her . But the woman 's blindness had stopped her hand . It was late afternoon when she got home . Her mother was playing cards with Debbie ; her father was watching the television . She went to sleep . She could imagine the garish colors her father was watching , green false grass , red uniforms . Half asleep , she heard the doorbell , then the voice of Father Joe . She got up , expecting to be called . But no one called her . From the end of the hall , she saw the priest walk into the den with her parents . She saw her father close the door . She heard the priest 's voice , then her parents ' : grave and troubled , the sounds had weight , they thickened in the air , some heavy liquid metal that would harden in a moment like a dense coiled spring . She heard her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color . She heard the priest laugh . It was then she knew . It was then the Spirit revealed that that man was not of the Spirit . She heard her father making coffee in the kitchen , and in the den her mother 's words , and laughing . She heard her parents close the door behind the priest . She left home the next morning . What she could fit in her Girl Scout knapsack she took . An extra pair of shoes , a pair of jeans , a shirt , some underwear . Already she was taking more than Jesus said to take . In the clear light of that fall morning , she walked to the bus station and took a bus west to Syracuse . She left no word for her parents , for the Scripture said , " A man shall leave father and mother . " It had been a year since she had left her father and mother I Icr parents had not found her . I lad they looked for hut ' She knew they could n't send the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own  | She had been traveling a year ; it would be good to settle someplace now . At Anne 's house . She would live with Anne . That was the Spirit , looking out for her , caring for her with a love more tender than any human parent could begin to try for . At first in Syracuse she thought it would be easy . She had found a room two blocks from the university on the top floor of an old yellow house . From her window she could see an aspen . Although she had never noticed what people referred to as nature , she liked the tree outside her window . Or perhaps it was simply having a window that was her own , a window she could sit at for hours without fearing the voices of her mother and her sister , high , sharp , shattering the texture , the clear pane , of things ( her life , her thoughts ) , springing against her life like shot against a window . Or her father 's voice , heavy as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his defeats and his apologies . Here she could sit for the first time in front of a window , looking at the aspen with its flat gold leaves , embroidering them into a dresser scarf that she was making to cover the gray plastic surface people had burned with cigarettes , ringed with the glasses holding what they drank there at the window . She could read her Bible , close her eyes , pray for guidance , open anywhere and know the Spirit was directing her . One day as she got off the bus coming back from her job at Nettie 's Needles  --  the same job she had had at home  --  a young man walked up to her as if he knew her . He smiled at her and said , " Excuse me , miss , but have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior ? " She felt her heart light up , grow solid against the bones of her breast . It was the messenger of the Lord . How kind his voice was ( she had spoken little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom she worked with , and they spoke about her work ) . How clear , how open his eyes seemed . He looked straight into her eyes , took both her hands and held them . " Praise the Lord , " he said . " Welcome , my sister . " Wise as serpents , innocent as doves . She had not been wise . She had followed the young man  --  Don Kingston was his name  --  to the house where he lived with what he told her was his family . He belonged to a community that called itself the Children of the Light . They lived in a house five blocks from where her room had been , six of them , and their leader , whom they called Father but whose name was Fletcher Voss . They embraced her  --  all seven of them  --  when they saw her ; they embraced her when she left the house and when she came back into it . They sang as they did the tasks they 'd been assigned  --  the girls cooked , the boys did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her room No need to be alone , they said , von are one of us , the family , we  | love you as our own . She moved in with them ; she slept in a room with Shelley and Susan . They called each other sister and embraced each night after the evening prayers were said . And each day before they left for their " outside jobs , " they prayed together and embraced each other . For the world was wicked and dangerous , they were sent out among wolves , they were safe only in the walls of the house . She had told them of the Spirit coming to her and they had said , " Praise the Lord , " and taken her hands and thanked God that she was among them . She had friends around her , more than friends , brothers and sisters who loved her , who appreciated her gifts . She was never lonely . There were chores for her to do when she came home from work , and since her outside job was a day job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked at night in the donut shop and Robert at the post office so they could be free for the daytime ministry ) , at night she went out onto the streets to speak to people , to warn them of the Coming of the Lord , the Blood of the Lamb , the corruption of their flesh , the wickedness in which they walked , the separation of the sheep and goats that was coming , coming , for the Lord was on His way , and many would not be saved . She did not know that she was prophesying falsely , that they were all false prophets , that they walked not in the Spirit but in Darkness led by the Devil in the guise of Fletcher Voss . Many came and went while Laura lived there . Some off buses stayed only for the meals , the beds , left when they had saved up money , when they had bathed and washed their clothes and eaten regularly for a week . These , Fletcher said , were minions of the Devil . But devils themselves were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would n't give up their money , or would n't go out on the streets at night , every night , to preach the Word . She , too , had had contempt for them , had prayed with joy and with thanksgiving when they left that the house ( where they were safe , the only place they could be safe ) was cleansed of their presence . Fletcher Voss was older than the rest of them and handsome with his dark hair and dark blue eyes . He had been to Vietnam . He had fought and suffered , he said , seen those he loved die , seen immorality , committed sin himself . And then he had had his vision . His vision was not like the coming of the Spirit to Laura , the Spirit who came in love . At the time she believed it was because he had seen war and she had not , had suffered as she had not . But now she knew it was because his vision  --  if he ever had a vision  --   --  was time milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voss had come in fire and thundci , it was a nsm with flaming  | hair whose voice boomed like thunder , whose swords glittered in the sun , their golden handles burning . He had told Fletcher that Fletcher had been sent by the Lord to save a chosen remnant from the vengeance of the Lord . The remnant would be called the Children of Light ; they would be recognized on the last day by the oil of anointing placed upon their foreheads by the hand of Fletcher Voss . At first she thought that he was greater than she ; that the coming of the Lord to him was greater , since the Lord spoke to him of the people he was to save , while the Spirit spoke to her only of her personal condition , to say she was the chosen one , the favored of the Lord . So for three months she was pleased to be subordinate to him , glad to follow his instructions , to ask his permission to keep some of her money for toilet articles , for thread and patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents at Fletcher 's suggestion ; he said it was better not to antagonize the natural family , since the Devil working through them and through the law could do the Children of Light harm . Her father had written to say he was glad she was well , they were worried about her , the door was always open to her . From her mother she heard nothing . ) She could see that Voss was fond of her . He complimented her on her work in the kitchen , on never complaining about money , on her zeal in bringing converts in . She had brought two African boys , students at the university , to the weekly prayer meetings . They came for two months , then stopped coming . She saw them later , dancing with other students in a bar . By March she had been in the house longer than anyone except Don . She told Voss that she had helped the healing priest ( Voss said he was the Devil in priest 's robes ; established churches were the Devil 's favorite scat ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosa , whose only real interest was knitting , left all the books to her . She said she would help him keep track of the household money so that he would be more free to preach , to bring in converts from the street . Voss smiled at her . He took her hand . " Thank you , " he said . " I realize that you believe you 're trying to help me . But money is evil , not only is it the root of evil , it is evil in itself . I believe that anyone who touches it is in danger ; I will run the risk myself rather than expose one who has been less tried , whose spirit is more delicate , more fine and beautiful . " ' I'hcn he began to invite her into his room , to pray alone with him . " You are so beautiful , " he would say when they had prayed . White skin and shining hair , he would say , touching her so that something stirred in her . I le knew bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the Lord wanted them to he joined flesh to flesh and not just in the spirit . Iic took  | her , he took her innocence , and she gave it , believing she was doing the work of the Lord . But then she saw . Saw that he was full of lies and was a thief . She saw , in his room at night , that he kept some of the money people brought in for himself . She let him know she saw . " No one will believe you , " he said , turning away from her . " I 'll tell them you 're insane , that you have visions . You 've talked to the others about your visions , it 's me they 'll believe . I 'll call the police and tell them you 've stolen money from me . They 'll lock you up and throw away the key . I 'll get the others to testify against you . " She had not been wise . Had had too much faith in the friendship of others . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater spirit . They will discover yours is the Spirit of Lies , of Thieving , of the Flesh that steals the flesh of others . " In a family meeting , he denounced her . And the others stood behind him , circled around her like wolves . She was a dove in the midst of wolves . " Leave us , " they chanted . " Leave , Spirit of Darkness . Leave us , " they kept shouting , all of them together , again , and then again . Who had said they were her brothers and her sisters . Who had said they knew she was the chosen of the Lord . She ran out of the house , leaving her bag behind . She walked through the dark streets , past the bars where college students laughed and danced and shouted from their cars . The car lights hurt her eyes , the sounds of the loud music hurt her skin , as she ran , ran past them , past their laughter and their shouted messages , ran past the government project , past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the highway , letting cars swerve to miss her . She ran till she got to the bus station , where she sat all night . She sat erect and terrified , afraid to sleep , afraid to see the eyes of Fletcher Voss that had grown into hands to choke her . Then she reached into her pocketbook and found her Bible . She prayed for comfort and for succor . The Spirit of Darkness had almost overcome her . She needed the shelter of the Lord . Then she remembered Matthew io . She had written it out in her notebook : " If the house is worthy , let your peace come upon it ; but if it is not worthy , let your peace return to you . And if any one will not receive you or listen to your words , shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that house or town . Truly , I say to you , it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile of triumph 11cr enemies had vanquished her now , but they would be repaid in kind , t hundredfold .  | Her fear vanished . She knew she would be cared for . For it said , in the same chapter of Matthew : " So have no fear of them ; for nothing is covered that will not be revealed , or hidden that will not be known . Are not two sparrows sold for a penny ? And not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father 's will . But even the hairs of your head are all numbered . Fear not , therefore ; you are of more value than many sparrows . " And she knew that she was of great value . For that reason she had been persecuted . Beware of men , Jesus had said , for they will deliver you up to councils , and flog you in their synagogues , and you will be dragged before governors and kings . This had almost happened to her . He said if he told people about what the Spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said he would get the people in the house to testify against her . Yet she would triumph , and her enemies go down to ruin . She imagined the house of the Children of Light in flames . But she would not be able to help them , for the flames would be the judgment of the Lord . She slept sitting up in the bus station . In the morning she went back to Mrs. Rosa 's store . She knew she would not stay there long . If they will not receive you , Jesus said , or listen to your words , shake off the dust from your feet as you leave the house or town . When they persecute you in one town , flee to the next . She knew she would be going somewhere soon , so she did n't want to get a room . She slept in the bus station and got to Nettie 's early in the morning , where she washed her body and her clothes , hiding them in the basement of the store to dry . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . She was working at Nettie 's Needles patiently explaining how to work a simple pattern to Mrs. Chamberlain , explaining the same thing for the fiftieth time . She wanted to tell Joan Chamberlain that she had no talent for needlework ; her fingers were slow and thick , she had no concentration , she would never finish the pillow cover for her little girl , the one with the squirrel and the nuts , in time for her birthday . But she knew she could n't say that , and Joan Chamberlain had been nice to her , asked her about her family , praised Laura 's skill , her clear teaching . So , after ripping out the red threads that were supposed to be green , green of course for the leaves of the tree in the background , and knowing that something was being arranged for her by her Father , who cared for her more than for many sparrows , she was not surprised to hear Joan Chamberlain say , " You would n't be interested in going to London for six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helper for my fancily . Of course , you 'd be one of the  | family yourself . But paid , of course . We could talk about that later . That is , if you 'd like to . But you 're probably happy here , and I would n't want to take you away from Nettie . " That was the way Joan Chamberlain was . She was a small , light woman with colorless eyelashes ; she never finished anything . She twitched ; she twittered ; she was a nervous little rodent in a cage , first sipping water , then pushing a wheel , then scattering its food , then running from one corner to another , appearing to look for something it could never actually possess . Shake off the dust from your feet . She knew she was meant to leave the city . London . She did n't care that it was London ; it could have been Buffalo , Detroit . A place had been found for her ; her Father had provided . She told Joan that the lease had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could move into their house early . Joan said terrific , terrific , she would have to ask her husband first , but he would probably be ecstatic , because maybe she could help out with the housework , only if she wanted to , but that would be terrific because she , Joan , was such a slob . She said she 'd be glad to , that she liked housework , that she found it soothing . Joan said that was just incredible , and just terrific . Laura told Joan to call her at Nettie 's Needles . She did not want the woman she was working for to know that she was sleeping in the bus station . Laura did n't like Jack Chamberlain . He was a tall , lean , fair-haired man , joking with his children , exasperated with his wife . Laura never understood how he could have married Joan . Perhaps she had once been pretty . Laura did not understand marriage ; the idea of it disgusted her : choosing a partner for the urges of the flesh , in filth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly the Chamberlains were unhappy . Jack raged ; Joan cried ; the children were disobedient and worried . She knew that she was good for the children . She taught them many things . It was n't her fault they were n't happy . She had overheard them talking to their mother . " She 's no fun , " they said . " She 's boring . " " Listen , you , " said Joan , " thank your lucky stars we 've got her . She 's got the patience of a saint . You could have a real monster . And when we get to London , you 'll have so much to do you wo n't even notice her . " She felt , always , the Chamberlains congratulating themselves for including her in their wonderful lives . She felt them doing it with each museum they took her to , each historic building they pointed out to her , each meal  | in each restaurant they offered . Food did not interest her ; she despised the Chamberlains for their sense that each new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips like animals over the desserts at an Indian restaurant . They could talk for a week about English cream . They did not think , they never understood , that the things that entered their mouths ended up in the drain . " I believe that food is so much more than something to fill the belly , " said Jack Chamberlain , congratulating himself on educating Laura . " It 's an art in itself , not only in its preparation but in its consumption . " And ends up in the drain , Laura wanted to tell him , but did not . Instead she smiled , appeared to take an interest . She wished that she did n't want to eat , but in fact she was often hungry . She would have preferred to eat the same foods every day . In food she savored what was sweet , white , soft , familiar . She kept in her room in the London flat a loaf of white bread , a tub of soft margarine , a jar of strawberry jam . When Joan found these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You do n't need to eat this stuff . Just help yourself to anything in the refrigerator . Anytime , for heaven 's sakes . Margarine , ugh . Laura , you poor darling . " She could not say to Joan that she preferred her margarine to Danish butter , her soft white sliced bread to the hard brown loaf they kept , her strawberry jam to their plum preserves . That she liked eating in her room , in her bed in silence , preferred it to the Chamberlain family table , where the children were forbidden to fight and where it was demanded that the conversation be intelligent . She knew she was not pleasing to the Chamberlains . The children were not interested in the things she thought of for them to do . She was nearly silent on the excursions the Chamberlains planned for her and the children : the Tower of London , Madame Tussaud 's . These were the wrong things to be teaching the children . She began reading to them from the Bible . Jessica , the oldest child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our father says it 's superstition . " Then she knew for certain that the Devil was in the house , had taken root , been fed and nourished , welcomed and revered . So it was no surprise to her when Jack Chamberlain told her they would not be needing her , no surprise that things worked out as they had with Helene . She knew that Helene hated Anne . Because Anne was beautiful , and Helene was not . Because Anne had only to walk into a room to make people love her . Things came easily to her ; people wanted to be near Anne for the things she did that were not difficult for her . She did not have to do favors , write letters , have people to live in her house .  | Helene hated Anne because she did not understand that the things that drew people to Anne , that gave her her house , her husband and her children were of no importance . Helene was angry , as Laura had once been angry . Now she knew she needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People needed her . Anne Foster needed her particularly . She would teach Anne that the things that made up her life were of no importance . And she would teach the children .  | Anne wanted to get an early start to beat , as far as possible , the rush of the Thanksgiving weekend , so she picked the children up at school and drove from there to Jane 's house on Long Island . Driving in the light that at three-thirty was already beginning to fade , she watched Laura pouring drinks for the children , giving them cookies . I would be doing that , she thought , and Michael would be driving . She began to feel teary at the thought of a holiday without him , her first in sixteen years . Michael . Her husband . All the days together , nights . Food cooked and eaten , children waited for and born , held , nursed in sickness . " I 'll go . . . . No , you sleep , I will this time . " All the hours shared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies , knowing , known . The arguments , estrangements , lonelinesses : " The person I most love knows not a thing about me , is a stranger , wants to do me harm . " Afterwards , the coming together , exciting , tender after the hard butts of willed misunderstanding , innocent uncomprehending tiredness , resentment , fear . She missed her husband terribly . There were things she wanted to tell him , ask him , every day , that she could say to no one else . And his body , yes , she had the dull ache of desire , constant now . It made her feel ashamed . No one had made love to her in ten weeks . If she were n't married , that would be the ordinary thing . Single people , widows , divorcees : that was their life . She was a coward . She could only just get by without her husband . That was the sort of thing she was afraid Jane would find out about her , and despise her for . Marriage , that little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not need marriage , entered into it for some convenience : money , sex , domestic comforts , the need for some general fealty  | formally contracted and arranged . But all the meals at home , the small conversations , the pleasure in familiar furniture , the late-night reading , all those dreams so badly realized in most houses were not the dreams of the great . Caroline had recoiled from those dreams as if they were dangerous . Yet her work was all about them . Was it dishonest of her ? Feeling as she did , ought she to have painted flowers like Georgia O'Keeffe , forbidding rocks that would push the children from the room , skyscrapers jutting into skies of industry or carnival but not of birds ? When Caroline 's work was dismissed as irrelevant , it was on the ground of excessive domesticity . But she was estranged from her family , kept her child from her , lived in hotels until she was sixty . Anne wondered what Jane 's house would be like . Women who lived alone revealed themselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone could not . A man who lived alone comfortably was an invention of the will ; a woman who lived without comfort , without order , was defying some curse of domestic servitude . It was hard to predict how Jane would live . She had worked hard , yet she had been a beauty ; she had lived alone most of her life , yet she had been beloved . Anne hoped the children would be all right in her house . Perhaps she should not have brought them on her first visit , before she knew what the house was like , before she knew Jane better . It was good that Ben would be there . The children adored him , and he was wonderful at taking them off the scene for small trips they considered fabulous . As they drove up the long pebbled driveway a light above the door of the house switched on . Jane appeared in the light , shielding her eyes ; Ben stood behind her . She was wearing a bright blue rough-woven shirt , black corduroy trousers , white socks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anne had thought of buying a pair for Sarah , but never for herself . It was partly silly for Jane to wear them : her thick white socks made her feet in those shoes look puffy , like a doll 's or a Japanese painting of a baby . Yet , standing in the harsh light , she struck Anne once again as astonishingly beautiful , powerful in her beauty , single in it , like a navigable river . " I ought to have put the light on for you earlier , but it 's terrifyingly bright so I can see thieves or marauders coming through the night . I ca n't bear to keep it on a second longer than I have to . It costs a fortune . Welcome . How was the drive ? And you are Peter and Sarah . " The children shook hands with Jane and said I low do you do . " It 's a great pleasure to meet yon " Line said " qtr I lank ' has said how very nice you are , and your mother Di @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ r  --  Dth ( 'r says they 're nice , you ca n't hchcvc that "  | The children laughed and looked at Ben . " Actually , " said Peter , " not everybody 's mother says they 're nice . I mean , I have this one friend , his mother always says to my mother when he comes to my house , If Oliver is terrible , I do n't want to know about it . ' " He was imitating Cheryl Jackson . He was showing off . In one minute , Jane had made a conquest ; her son was in love . " Sarah , " said Jane . " I have a room with a beautiful bed in it . It used to be my bed . Do you want to see it ? " " Yes , please , " said Sarah . If only , Anne thought , they would act like this for the rest of the weekend . They all walked into the house . Laura hung back , a few feet behind them . Anne had forgotten to introduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This is my friend , Laura , who helps me with the children , " Anne said . Jane looked at her perfunctorily . " How do you do , " she said , and turned away . " Just fine , " said Laura , smiling , to Jane 's back . Peter was jabbering to Jane about his friend Oliver , about how terrible he really was . The children disappeared upstairs with Jane and Ben ; Anne put her bags down in the kitchen . It was a wide , high room , painted white , with blue-and-white plates hung on the wall and copper pots on hooks . There was a step down to the eating area , dominated by a refectory table . Places were set for seven , and in the center , yellow chrysanthemums stood in a blue vase . There were skylights in the ceiling and windows above eye level that looked out to the dark garden . " It 's a beautiful room , is n't it ? " Anne said to Laura . Laura merely smiled and looked ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mistake to bring her . But she could n't have been left . How horrible it would have been to think of her alone in the kitchen , eating a peanut butter sandwich while they feasted . It would have been impossible , thinking of her so , to enjoy the holiday . Sarah came racing into the room . " I get to sleep in a canopy bed like the one in Snow White when she 's dead , and it was Mrs. Watson 's when she was my age . " Sarah emphasized the my as if to indicate a linked proprietary state with Jane . " And we each have a tin of cookies next to our bed in case we wake up hungry , " Peter said . " That was Ben 's idea , " said Jane . " That 's always done in English houses , " Jane explained to the children . " Have you ever been in England ? " " Our father 's in France , " said Peter . " I fell he hack on May twentysecond . I lc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to go to England , " Sarah said . " ' Hwy have the queen there . "  | " For now , come and have some ice cream . I suppose you 've had your dinner . " " Yes , " said Peter . " We stopped at McDonald 's . I got a cheeseburger , french fries and a Coke . My sister got a hamburger , french fries and a root beer . My mother got ... " " That 's enough , " said Anne . " Keep our nasty secrets . " " Our mother got a milk shake , " Peter said , giggling . " Traitor , you swore , " Anne said . " Tomorrow , " said Jane , " you children can help me make pies . Would you like that ? Your mother and Mr. Hardy will have work to do . We 'll do the cooking . " " Our mother does the cooking , " Sarah said . " Not tomorrow , Sarah , " said Jane . " Tomorrow she looks at pictures . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's the most important work your mother can do . She looks at pictures , then she writes about them . She 's very good at it . " " We do n't know that yet , " Anne said . " Of course we do . We 're not stupid , " Jane said , leading Ben to the table . She awoke at six . The light , still darkened , only turning silvery , made her feel at first diminished ; she seemed small to herself in the white bed with its gray iron frame . The leaves outside the windows were barely visible ; she seemed to exist in space . I am in Jane 's house , she thought ; it is Thanksgiving . Yet I am not expected to make a meal . She swung her legs out of her bed as if she were on an ocean liner , feeling the suspension of the rules that governed and pressed down her life into the shape that made it recognizable to strangers . The walls of the room were completely white . White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blew in the thin light . She looked around to see the painting on the wall above her bed . Then she felt ashamed , as if she had awakened forgetting that there was a lover in the bed beside her . It had taken her an hour and a half to get to sleep after seeing the painting for the first time . Jane had shown her to the room , and she had found it on the wall , simply there above the bed iii its decorative function . One of the figures in the painting wore a blue dress , the ether , a brown with black stripes . They were walking into leaves that would engulf them ; the lift of their heavy feet suggested they were wady happily to disappear .  | Their backs were toward the viewer , so their faces were invisible , clearly unimportant . They were going somewhwere , standing for something , for journeys which appeared to be small but which could mean the house unseen again , the town only remembered , the clothes left in the bureau drawers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent toward each other . Their arms encircled each other . The hands ( which were not a success , Anne saw ; one hand looked rather like a leg of lamb ) were about to meet in the middle of the back of the brown figure . Both women 's hair was greenish blue to complement the green of the background ; their boots were blue-black ; their stockings bluish gray . The posture of their backs spelled grief , connection . The figure in brown bent toward the blue one as if she were weeping on her shoulder from sheer weariness . Anne looked again at the hand of the blue figure on the waist of the figure in brown . She saw it then : the figure in blue propelled the other slightly forward . In the curve of her body was impatience for the other 's hesitancy  --  over mourning , memory . The figure in blue wanted to get on : to the woods the color of emeralds . She was not thinking of the town at their backs . Anne had started when she heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room with her . " It 's called Two Women Walking , " Jane said . " It 's one I would never sell ; I ca n't even bring myself to lend it for the exhibition . I put in your room for the weekend , so you can look at it . We 'll talk about it in the morning . " And now she could hear Jane stirring in the kitchen ; perhaps that was what had wakened her . She could not dress , she feared , without waking someone , so she risked going downstairs in her bathrobe . If Jane was dressed , it would be awkward ; it would indicate that Anne felt more intimate with Jane than Jane did with her . Anne feared friendships between women that began in intimacy and played themselves out in small talk . And she wanted Jane to like her in a way that made her feel both young and crude . For women such as Jane , liking , not liking , she imagined , was of little interest , at most a curiosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw Jane in a red woolen bathrobe , she was prepared to read it as an act of the most perfect hospitality . " Did you sleep all right ? " asked Jane . " I hope my puttering did n't wake you . It 's one of the useless blessings of old age to need almost no sleep . " " No , I woke before I heard you . I was thinking of the painting . " " It 's me and Caroline , " Jane said with pride , with a great , sure joy . But was it ? It was as ' midi about Caroline 's learning to move her figures off center , about using the Fame palette but sweetening it , applying what she  | had learned from the Japanese . Could she say that to Jane ? And what was the truth of it ? Both were , the memory and the technique . It was possible that Caroline might have seen two other women , complete strangers , in that posture , in that light , and been taken by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had she not taken that walk with Jane each evening , the idea would not have come to her at all . Jane was an intelligent woman , but Caroline 's paintings were the work of someone she loved ; their meaning to her was singular , refracted . Perhaps the paintings were more truly hers because of that , perhaps she had been right to keep them to herself . But Anne could n't help thinking that more people should have seen them . Yet museums were often stupid , prejudiced ; without collectors most painters would have starved or died unnoticed . She thought of all the different ways a painting  --  one of Caroline 's paintings  --  could exist : as an object , decorative in its function , pleasing , not pleasing to the eye of the innocent stranger . The same painting was to Anne completely different ; she could guess its history , it spun out from itself , like a spider , lines growing forward , backward . To Jane the paintings were themselves and Caroline ; they did n't spin out lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a disk of sunlight , from the life of a beloved woman . And there were the collectors , for whom paintings were a different kind of object , an investment or a curiosity , a sign of something : power , taste , discernment . A painting was almost never itself . Yet it was her job to look first at each painting as if it were the only painting in the universe , then to trace the lines backward and forward . Only then could she think about the woman holding the brush , taking experience and making this of it , that of it : beauty that would endure , that would say to life , stop here , now ; that would hold life , thicken it and make it valuable , enduring , hard . And what she would say about the paintings  --  would it influence the men with money , coming to these objects to secure a name , a safe old age , a shelter against ruin ? And here was Jane at the stove , her back to Anne , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman as they walked into the wind . Anne looked out the glass door . A small brown bird came dipping , pecking at the feeder on the porch . Stairs led down to the garden . Only the chrysanthemums were bright there . The brown leaves fell into dry , dull grass ; a yellow maple leaf dropped into the birdbath , floated , and then disappeared . Juniper berries hung , opaque and rich among green needles . Jane handed Anne coffee , standing beside the d(x)r.  | " It 's a lovely house , " Anne said , " it must give you great comfort . " " Great comfort . I used only to be able to come here in the summer , but now I 'm retired , I come here nearly every weekend . " " When did you buy it ? " " In 1950 . I was in a bad way when Caroline died , for quite a few years . Most people would call it a depression , but my family never went in for that , so it was said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this house would be good therapy . " What did Jane want her to say ? Was she one of those people who thought politeness consisted of asking the right questions , or of asking no question at all , of saying something about oneself , or keeping oneself completely out of the picture ? " What was the house like when you got it ? " Anne asked . " Rather a wreck . This kitchen was two rooms , a kitchen and a dining room . I had a wall knocked out . Come around and I 'll show you . " She walked around her house as her ancestors must have walked around their estates . The living room , narrow and irregularly shaped , had four small windows and one large bay . Jane explained why she had decided on the bay , the window seat , had had the beams exposed . She spoke of doors and insulation , furniture and curtains , with the same familiarity . She had the androgyne 's pleasure in her dwelling : decisions of structure and of decoration both had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own fears in relation to getting the wiring fixed . But she was married , and she was n't rich . She could never inhabit a house with the singular freedom and mastery of Jane . The house was squarish , solid ; the furniture , with its bright slipcovers , the lamps with their cream silk shades , the Indian rugs , the absence of photographs , the walls full of books , the shameful lighter patches where Caroline 's paintings had lately been taken down , showed a calculated mix . The rooms were both austere and welcoming ; one could work there or read for pleasure . One could come into these rooms quite properly and speak of the death of a son , killed in a war or on a motorcycle . One could get drunk here and talk of the betrayals of a business partner or a wife or husband , but it would not be imagined that one could be sick on the rug , or move , unconscious , to the sofa to find one 's way home in the morning . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her children ; it was one she hoped they would remember when , in middle age , they thought about the houses of their childhood . Jane led Aline into the kitchen . " Now , tell Inc what you really want to know about Caroline . You did n't need me to tell you about Criinewald ;  | you knew all about it , much more than I. You were merely being polite , or perhaps my letter frightened you . " " Perhaps , " said Anne . " You see , I do n't know what I have a right to know . I do n't want to seem intrusive or to offend you . " " My dear , I have the skin of a rhinoceros . I 've been told a thousand times . " " Still , she is yours in a way that she 's not mine . And certainly not mine to give to strangers , opened up and cut to pieces . " Jane gave her a slow , comprehending look . She pushed her hair back off her forehead with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back beautifully straight , although it was a bench she sat on and she leaned on air . Anne saw that Jane wanted to tell her things but did not want to seem to be giving them away too easily . " Tell me about Paris . The first time , I mean . How did she talk her father into letting her go ? " Jane laughed . " Plain stubbornness . My God , she was a stubborn woman . She was a person who could really hold out . " Anne fingered the milk pitcher , an old-fashioned yellow with raised pink flowers . " She was his favorite child , " Jane went on . " Henry , the oldest brother , ought to have been the favorite . He did everything his father wanted : went to all his father 's schools  --  Exeter , Amherst  --  he went into the bank and followed his father there . But his father did n't like him ; he despised him for not having enough spirit . What he wanted was a spirit he could break . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know . I suppose I 'm rather unfair to him because I ca n't forgive him for being so awful when Stephen was born . " Guiltily Anne felt her own excitement . This , of course , was what she wanted to know about : the scandal of the illegitimate child . It lit up Caroline 's life with garish and unnatural yet pleasing color . Who was Stephen 's father ? And then what happened ? Soap-opera questions . " Poor Caroline , " said Jane . " She was n't young , you know , when it happened . She 'd lived on her own for six years ; she was thirty-six . She felt she was proving something to her father  --  that she could he on her own and take care of herself . Then she got pregnant , and she felt it was the end of her life . Yet her father was the first person she told . " " How did he respond ? " " All outraged honor . She had betrayed his trust , besmirched the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe . " " You do n't believe he was really distressed ? "  | " Yes , partly , of course he was . It was , after all , a scandal . They were an important family and Philadelphia was not Paris . But he took great pleasure in having been right all along , in having his predictions come true . " " I gathered that from the letters . Pleasure in correct judgment kept creeping through the outrage . " " You do see things , do n't you , " Jane said , giving Anne one of her considered looks . Anne blushed . " It was n't hard to see . " " Listen , my dear , I must give you a piece of advice . It 's a kind of ingratitude not to accept praise when it 's offered . And it does no good to undervalue yourself . People are always ready to do that for you . " " I guess in my family thinking too well of yourself was the cardinal sin . And then I had a sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother was always afraid she 'd feel bad or jealous of me . " " Yes , well , all that 's in the past , you 're a grown woman now , not a child . And so you must simply stop things that are not in your best interest . " Anne felt embarrassed . She had revealed too much , and in a mode Jane did not find congenial . " You must simply stop things that are not in your own best interest . " Jane was not a person she would want to be around if she was feeling weak . " How did Caroline feel about her father , do you think ? " " For years she was furious and would n't speak to him , except in the way she had to . You know , of course , the situation with the money and with Stephen . " " No . " " Caroline had no money of her own until her aunt Adelaide died , which was 1907 , and even then it was n't much . Her money came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford to be cut off from him entirely , because she needed that money if she was going to paint . " " And Stephen ? " " Her father agreed to be responsible for Stephen 's support as long as Caroline promised she would bring the child home and not take him out of the country until he was twenty-one . He kept saying it was France that was the cause of all this heartache . " Jane walked to the door and rubbed a spot off the glass with her index finger . " It was a wicked thing he did . It caused terrible suffering . " She sat down at the table . " Caroline hated America . Particularly Philadelphia . She had never been well received here , and she had been unhappy as a young girl . She said the light was all wrong : the sun was too high , the clouds were useless , there was no silver iii the leaves . And there was no  | place , she said , where one could sit and talk and have coffee , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one you wanted to talk to , and no coffee that was drinkable . " Jane laughed . " Of course , it was more than that , but she could n't work there . She tried . She stayed at home till Stephen was two , and she could n't bear it . " " What did she do ? " " She packed up and went back to France . It was a very productive period for her . " 1902 ? 1908 . The years she changed her picture plane , her palette . Those were the years she exhibited with the Fauves ; those years showed her transformation from an Impressionist to a Modern , from an American to an international painter . " What happened to Stephen then ? " " He lived at his grandparents ' house . He had a governess . And his aunt Maggie looked after him . " " Did Caroline ever see him ? " " She came home in the summers . She bought a house on the Hudson ? you know it from the landscapes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the Rhine could n't touch the Hudson ; it was second only to the Loire . But she did n't like having a small child around her . They were not good times for Stephen . " " Did she ever like having him around her ? " Jane looked uneasy . " Stephen was n't always easy to be around . He was n't a happy person , he became morose quite often . And he was worst around his mother . He never believed she loved him . " " Did she ? " Jane set the cups down in the sink impatiently . " Mother love . I have n't the vaguest idea what it means . All these children claiming their mothers did n't love them , and all these mothers saying they 'd die for their children . Even women who beat their children say they love them , they ca n't live without them , they ca n't live without them , they would n't dream of giving them up . What does it mean I love my child ' ? " She turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't lurk in the doorway like that . " Anne turned around and saw Laura , hanging back at the entrance to the kitchen . She was smiling at Jane , but Jane would n't look at her . " Have some coffee , my dear , " Jane said , handing her a cup . " I do n't drink coffee , thank you , " Laura said . " Well , then , tea , " said Jane , pouring the coffee down the sink as if it had been spoiled by I , anra 's refusal of it . Anne wanted to protect I.aura iron ' Jane her quick , angry nurvcmcnts ,  | her refusing looks . Jane had decided she did n't like Laura , and she was n't the kind of person to try to be nice to someone she did n't at first take to . But Laura was no match for her , and Anne did n't want to see Laura hurt . " Laura likes cocoa in the morning . I 'll make it for her . We usually have a cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point of it , " said Jane . " It 's no stimulation whatever , and it 's terribly fattening . You should learn to drink coffee or tea , my dear . It will make life much easier for you in civilized society . " Anne and Laura drank their cocoa silently while Jane moved around the kitchen peeling potatoes , chopping vegetables . Anne looked at Laura ; Laura smiled from over the edge of her cup . Anne could see that there would be no more talk about Caroline with Laura there . But she did n't resent Laura 's presence ; she saw her as a small , colorless bird about to be swooped on by a hawk who made beautiful downward cuts through the morning sunlight . She was delighted when the children came down dressed and ready , they said , for a walk on the beach . Ben had said he would take them for a walk on the beach before breakfast . " But Ben 's not up yet , " Anne said . " Let him have his rest . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coming into the kitchen . " Just give me a cup of tea and we 're off . Good morning , my darlings , " he said to Jane and Anne . " Good morning , Miss Post , " he said to Laura . " Why do n't you all go , " said Jane , not looking at anyone as she gave Ben his tea . " I 'll stay and help you , " Anne said . " Of course you wo n't . I prefer to do things by myself anyway at this stage of the meal . " " All right , " said Anne . " I 'll go and change . " Anne knew by the set of Jane 's back that she was angry . Her back was impatient , like the back of the woman in the painting . Some high door had closed ; the gate had , as Anne knew it would , come down . Anne did n't know how it had happened , but she was glad to be walking out the door . The air was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The children knew the ocean in summer , but in all other seasons it ceased to exist for them . To find it still intact when they had been to school was a sign of richness and benevolence , a treasure hoarded , opened up for them now . Anne worried about Laura , about Jane , worried that she did n't have it in her to do justice to the paintings , worried that the dinner would not be a success , that they would go to bed disappointed , the betrayal of a  | holiday gone wrong coating their tongues like too much sugar . But she did n't worry about her children . They walked far ahead of her . She saw them as she saw the sea : high , brimming , whole . She held the shells they gave her to collect , the stones she knew would grow uninteresting as they dried ; she saw the colors rise on their faces . She ran after them , embraced them , felt , through their thick clothes , the quick , light beating of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never felt this for her son , and it was luck , bad luck . Or was it some deficiency of spirit , some inexcusable coldness at the center that cast doubt on all the rest of her life ? How could she not have loved her two-year-old child ? Jane said he was n't easy to love . But a child did n't have to earn its mother 's love by being attractive or enjoyable or easy to be with . You loved them simply because they were . And because they were yours . Caroline was not an unloving woman . But the child was a bad accident born of the body , fathered in secret , by a stranger whose name no one knew . How primitive it was , this love of children : flesh and flesh , bone , blood connection . The spirits of children flickered , darted : one caught glimpses of them only , streaks of light in the thick forest of their animal lives . She was able to love her children 's bodies because her own body had not trapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she loved their flesh . And since she loved the body of the man who 'd fathered them . Could Caroline have loved her son more if she 'd loved his father ? She 'd died keeping his identity a secret : it was impossible to know . " I 'm afraid I did something to offend Jane this morning , " Anne said to Ben . " Oh , that 's always happening . It does n't mean a lot . " " Only , I wish I knew what it was . " " You 'll find out in time . She 'll approach you in a sackcloth , covered with contrition for her bad temper . That is , if she likes you . If she does n't , she 'll just go on being icy . One puts up with a great deal from Jane . " " Yes , " said Anne , thinking of her gesture , her brushing the hair off her forehead with the heel of her hand . She entered the house fearfully ; Jane in a long white apron greeted them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embrace her . She was embraced back , Jane kissed her forehead . " I missed you , " she wanted to say , placing her cool cheek against Jane 's , which was warm and dryish . But that was absurd ; she knew Jane only slightly , she had left her only an hour before . It was a strange thing for Anne , being served by a woman she admired , sometimes feared . Jane made food ; appear and disappear , she put cult plates  | and washed them ; in the kitchen what she did sent up good smells : rich roasting meat , apples bursting in their pastry . It had never happened to her before : Anne was sent away to think , to look , to use her mind , and down below her someone else took on the part of life that fed the body . But that someone else was Jane , beautiful , learned , masterful . No one could have been less like Anne 's mother . Even when she was a child Anne could never have left a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother together seemed unsafe to Anne , as if their slow unhappiness might catch fire in the kitchen and bring the house down on their heads . Jane gave the call for dinner and Anne came down to the table . It was the table she had dreamed of setting but did n't have the money for . It was a table her mother could n't have set in thousands of years . The silver candlesticks , the china with its pattern of peacocks , the great variety of spoons and forks and knives , the silver bowl with its chrysanthemums , its brown oak and green holly leaves  --  it was all that Anne felt she had not been born to . Everyone sat shyly ; the formal beauty made them quiet . Then Jane brought out the turkey , human , comic on its platter . Talk began . The bird was praised ; it was coveted ; choices were made of dark meat or white . Dishes were passed , and people made arrangements on their plate that pleased them . Jane stood , said a blessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune , like a spray of diamonds on the dark hair of a woman , as they all acknowledged gratitude in the name of Puritans who must have feared , three hundred years before , the brief appearance of their own good luck . The two days passed quickly , and yet , since winter was filling in the autumn sky , replacing , dully , the blue flame with bleached silver , there was a solidity to every action , as if people were hoarding something , anything , against a future scarcity they could n't name . Anne spent her mornings with the paintings , looking closely , making notes , taking photographs so she would have slides of them for her collection . In the afternoons , she walked on the beach with the children and afterwards played cards with them by the fireplace while Jane fixed supper . It was so clearly important to Jane that Anne be freed of domestic responsibility that Anne stopped offering her help . She suggested that Laura do the dishes , an offer which Jane accepted as if Anne were lending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't think Laura was having a good time . It was hard to tell ,  | for Laura 's face maintained the blank matte she habitually presented . And she smiled , as always , when she caught anybody 's eye . But there was no place for her . The children had deserted her in favor of Ben and Jane , and Anne had to keep reminding herself to include Laura in the conversation . But there were conversations Anne wanted her excluded from ; she did n't like Laura 's listening in on their conversations about Caroline . What could Laura make of a life like Caroline 's , that high-colored uneven surface full of passionate triumphs and errors ? So the glimpses she got of Laura , staring , smiling when she was looked at , made her feel unnerved . She had to remind herself to feel pity , but always irritation had to be smoothed down , pushed back . Pity was an emotion she had formerly despised ; not wishing it for herself , she felt reluctant to offer it to others . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careless impatient gesture , and she felt its value . It was Saturday evening . The children were in bed and the adults sat around the fire with their books . Anne had bought , on one of her shopping trips with the children , a bottle of Courvoisier for Jane . She and Jane and Ben took slow sips from their snifters , putting them down in the light they read by , watching , occasionally , the light in the amber liquid . The three of them became conscious of a chill in the air ; they would have to rise , get a sweater or go to bed . There was a moment of indecision and then , as if a clock had been struck , they knew the evening had ended . " I must tell you about Sundays , " Jane said . " I go to church . Depending upon the hour of your departure , I could go early or late . Will you tell me what you wish ? Unless , of course , any of you wants to accompany me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some understanding of Jane . But she could n't comprehend that within that complicated , finely rendered consciousness , there lodged the image of a prayable being . Was it the same person Laura thought of as she stared over the top of her Bible ? Once more , Anne felt at the frontier of an alien land , and one she had no inclination to explore . She looked at Laura , then at Jane . So the two of them had something in common . Perhaps it would make Laura less lonely to go to church with someone . " Would you like to go , Laura ? " she asked the girl , who sat away from them , on a straight chair , leaning her Bible on the corner of the library table . " No , thanks , " said Laura , smiling . " Are you religious , dear ? " Jane asked , as if she were asking her if she could read . " I have a religious life , but I do n't go to church . "  | " I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ? " Anne was appalled . How could Jane ask such a question ; it was like asking Laura what the nature of her sexual life was . But Laura did n't seem afraid . " It 's very different than what you do . " Anne could feel her heart beat deeper in her empty chest . Now it would happen . Jane would say something demolishing , and Laura would be defenseless . And she could n't protect Laura without crossing Jane ; she knew , therefore , that she would leave the girl exposed . Jane stood up and poked the fire . " Well , Anne , it 's up to you . Do you want to make an early start of it , then ? It might be better in terms of traffic . " " Yes , that would be best , " said Anne . She could have wept . Jane wanted them to leave . And it was Laura 's fault . She had spoiled the weekend ; she had poisoned the well . Anne heard a knock at her bedroom door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knocking through an impulse to politeness or angling to spend the night in her bed . She hated having to make that kind of decision : did one go along with the request , innocent in its own right , or refuse it , fearing to set a bad precedent ? " Come in , " she said , uncertain of the welcome she would give . She was glad to imagine one of the children in the room with her ; the sharpness of Jane 's dismissal had unbalanced her , and when she felt off balance , the weight of the children could make her feel set to rights . Yet she thought it was a cheat , to use her children for comfort . It was their dependence that soothed her , and their trust ; it was their weakness , after all , that gave her strength . " May I come in , " said Jane , sticking her head around the door . Anne sat up in bed and covered her chest with the sheet . Her surprise at discovering Jane and not her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I brought the brandy up . I hoped we could talk before you left . " " Of course , " said Anne , starting to get out of bed . " No , do n't leave the covers . I 'll sit here on the bed , if you do n't mind . " " Not at all . I was expecting one of the children . What a pleasure to find you instead . " " I 'm afraid I 've been rather snappish from time to time this weekend . I did n't want to scud you off on that note . " " You 've been wonderful . " " Not consistently . I 'm not by nature a patient person . It would he nice  | if I could say I used to be , but in fact I 'm far better than I was when I was young . I 'm not good at being nice to people I do n't want around . Particularly in my own house . I find it lacerating  --  as if I were wearing some itchy material . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like Laura . " " She 's a bad piece of work . " Anne felt emboldened by the situation 's informality , an informality that Jane had chosen . " Oh , Jane , you simply ca n't say that . The children adore her . " " The children adore Ben ; they get along all right with Laura , that 's all . She has a dreadful arrogance , that girl . " " She seems to me terribly insecure ; she does n't know what to say next or where to put one foot in front of the other . She 's homeless , Jane ; she has nowhere to go , and she does n't know where to begin to look . " " Yes , and she 's quite arrogant about it . Have you asked her ever ? And think of that vacant smile . Absolutely chilling . " Anne sat straighter in the bed . " Jane , I agree she 's not ideal . But the ideal has n't presented itself , and she 's far from the worst . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't do my work without live-in help . " " Surely there 's someone else . " " Not in Selby in the middle of the year . " " What about those agencies who send au pairs from abroad ? " " What guarantee do I have that anyone else would be better ? I could spend my time comforting a Swiss manic-depressive or a Norwegian alcoholic whom I 'd have to hide the liquor from . I 'd rather stay with the devil I know . " Jane looked up sharply . " I hope you 're right . It 's the opposite of what I want , to bring up anything to interfere with your work on Caroline . The children are wonderful , and one would like somebody wonderful to care for them . " " The children are wonderful , and I 'm not worried about them . Besides , if they learn a little patience and kindness from this experience , it 's all to the good . " " Listen , dearest Anne , forgive me for talking like this . I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanity , you know , of a childless woman . " Anne put her arms around Jane and embraced her . I low pleasant it was to feel Jane 's large hones , her firm flesh . She had always been afraid to embrace her mother too robustly I lcr mother was so much smaller than she ; her bones were light and delicate . Anne felt for years that she had  | loomed above her mother , that she could hurt her with her sheer physical size . Jane smoothed Anne 's hair and kissed her on the forehead . " Shall I turn off the light ? " she said . " That would be lovely . " " You 'll sleep well now ? " " Yes . " She would sleep well ; she was very happy . Jane had taken her in . " Mother , we need to speak to you alone , " said Peter , the minute they had got home and had hung up their coats . Peter 's urgent bulletins were undependable . His alarm might be entirely unwarranted or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One could never tell if he was being , on any occasion , the boy who cried wolf or the boy with his finger in the dike . " Tomorrow 's Laura 's birthday , " he said , short of breath , closing the door to Anne 's bedroom , " and we really have to make it good . " So Jane was wrong , Anne thought , they were fond of her . " Laura 's an orphan , " Sarah said seriously . " She 's never had a birthday party . " " How do you know that ? " asked Anne with concern . " Well , we asked her if it was sad not to have your parents with you on your birthday . And she said she did n't have any parents , " Peter said . " So that means she 's an orphan , " Sarah said , looking dreamy . " That means she must have been brought up in an orphanage , " Peter said . " There are n't very many orphanages anymore , " Anne said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no parents ? " Sarah asked . " You go and live with other people who are like your parents . They 're called foster parents . " " I do n't think that happened to Laura . I think she lived in an orphanage . " Why do you think that ? " " Well , if she had those foster parents , she 'd write to them , or call them . She never calls anyone ; she never gets any letters . " " Do you like being with Laura ? " Anne asked , daringly , not knowing what she would do if they said they did n't . So much of life with children , she thought , was throwing balls ahead of you and then hoping you could run fast enough to catch them . " She does a lot of things with us , " said Sarah . " She never yells at us. "  | " Who yells at you ? " asked Anne . " You do , " said both the children . " I do n't yell at you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anne felt jealousy ripple over her . She wanted to say to the children , Do n't you miss me ? Do n't you hate my not being around ? " They do n't let you raise your voice in orphanages , " Peter said . " They make you talk in a whisper . They shave your head and do n't let you eat anything but oatmeal . " Sarah was looking at her brother with rapt fascination . One could never tell what the springs of romance would be for children . To them Laura was mysterious and exciting . The scent of deprivation that hung on her they picked up . Only , in their nostrils it was an exotic perfume : the stuff of their nightmares made to breathe plain air . " You 're going to make her that daisy cake , right ? " said Peter . " Yes , and I 'll invite Helene , and in the afternoon Laura and I will go to lunch . " " Invite Adrian , " Sarah said . " Laura likes Adrian . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't think he 'll be able to come . " " Anyway , you can ask him , Mommy , " Sarah said . She felt her children steer her into a corner , as if she were a cow being pushed into a stall . She did n't want Adrian near Laura . The combination seemed to her grotesque . But she knew she had no right to that judgment . If it would please Laura to have Adrian , Anne ought to invite him . It was supposed to be her day . " And buy her a present from you , " Sarah said . Anne had n't thought of that . What did you buy a girl like Laura ? " I 'm giving her the model I just made . Of a yacht . It was very complicated . She 'll like that , " said Peter . " I 'm giving her the turkey we made out of pine cones at school for Thanksgiving . I saved it , " Sarah said . " They do n't give you presents in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and Daddy died , where would we go ? " " You 'd go with Aunt Beth and Uncle Richard . " " We would n't get to pick ? " " Who would you pick ? " They looked at each other . It had obviously been a topic between th em . " Ben , " said Peter . Anne was surprised . " Why Ben ? "  | " Because then we could live with him in England . You know , in England they have the queen . " The queen . Anne remembered that when she was Peter 's age she had kept a scrapbook about the coronation of Queen Elizabeth . Her sister had colored all the pictures with crayon one day , and she had been furious . But their mother would n't say anything to Beth ; she said Beth had n't meant it , that Beth had thought she was making the book nicer . Anne had known , still knew , that was n't true ; Beth was trying to ruin something , and she did . Thirty years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , wondering what impress would set on the soft wax of their memories to come out years later , a perfect medal struck in brass , treasured , as any old injustice is , simply for enduring . " Daddy and I are n't going to die , " she said and instantly regretted it . She should n't say that to them . She should promise to keep them only as safe as she could . " When is your job going to be over ? " Sarah asked . " June , " said Anne . " Then Daddy will be home and Laura wo n't be here and everything will be like it was before , " Sarah said . Just like it was before . She saw her past life as a small warm lake in which she had swum contentedly with slow , plain strokes . But now she felt the bottom had always been muddy ; leaves and twigs , weeds , gray-green and shapeless , rose to the surface . She watched her daughter counting on her fingers . " Seven more months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helene and Adrian in the morning . Adrian sounded as if he was not alone ; grumpily he agreed to come . Helene 's voice , on the other hand , indicated she had been awake for hours . Anne felt its timbre was calculated for reproach . She realized she had forgotten entirely about Helene , and she hated that about life , that people could be blotted out , sliced off , as if by a blade falling , that life could fill itself up like a television screen or a pointillist 's canvas with small hectic dots , creating some images , pushing others out . With people she loved , this anguished her ; whenever she encountered it , she was distressed . She did n't like Helene  --  she was relieved that she did n't have to see much of her ; it was one of the benefits of Michael 's absence . Nevertheless , it shocked her that lelene 's life had ceased to exist for her so entirely . How are we rooted in the world , she wondered , when for others we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not seen you or the children or Laura for weeks and weeks , " Helene said . " I 'm sorry , Helene . I 've been so caught up ... " I hope Laura at least has some free time for pleasure . " Guiltily , Anne realized that Laura hardly ever left the house without her or the children . But she could n't imagine anything Laura would want to do . She worried that she had taken advantage of the girl 's unhappy nature . " She 's terribly conscientious , " said Anne . " Ah , yes , I know , it is why I was recommending her . But she is young . She must enjoy her life . " Once more , Anne was struck by how much she disliked Helene . She was tired of not liking people whom she had no justification for disliking . If she disliked Adrian , Barbara , or Ianthe , she would be able to come up with reasons : Adrian was lustful and self-absorbed , Barbara had an acid tongue and a controlling nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she liked to be with them . Helene and Laura presented to her nothing she could turn away from without a sense of failure . She was determined to make Laura 's birthday successful , memorable even . She was pleased with the gift she had bought Laura , a dress she had seen in the window of Lorilard 's , a store that had always puzzled her . She imagined that originally it had catered to the tastes of better-heeled , middle-aged faculty wives whose ideal in casual dress derived from a misunderstanding of the English . The items that made up the bulk of the store 's inventory still served this clientele , but as the possibilities for faculty-wife dress broadened , the store had tried to comprehend the revolution . It had failed , and the failure had been one of understanding . As an institution , it had depended on a standard that had no quick variations ; when it had to cope with rapid changes of style , its timing was embarrassingly off  --  a season or perhaps two behind , but that small lag was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has lost his wife to a new lover , the store had its small victories . Occasionally , you found , passing by the window  --  for no one anyone knew went in there regularly ? something one might think of buying . And if you bought , you always felt good about the purchase , as if it were a charitable act . The green challis dress she wanted for Laura had caught her eye in the store window because of its brilliant colors . It was a shapeless dress , with long sleeves and a plain collar . Like everything in I orilard 's , it was overpriced , but on this occasion , that , too , pleased her . She thought it was perfect for Laura . She bought , as well , a pair of green wool tights and a long royal-blue wool scarf . Laura could wear the tights with the dress , they  | would be warm and pretty ; she could wear her sandals with them indoors . And , for a while , she could wear the wool scarf with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a winter coat , she had said she did n't need one . At eleven o'clock , Anne asked Laura to come into the kitchen . " I want to give you your present , " she said . Slowly , as if she were in a trance , Laura unwrapped the package . She lifted the dress out of its wrappings , held it up , folded it , and put it back into the box . " It 's very nice , Anne , thank you , " she said , without expression . Anne panicked . " If you do n't like it , I can take it back . " " No , I would n't do that . " " You could wear it with the green tights . It would be nice and warm . I thought you could wear it for the party if you wanted to . " " All right . " " Only if you want to , " Anne said . " Should I try it on now ? " " If you want to , sure , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen , Anne felt clumsy and embarrassed . Had she offended Laura ? Had she bought her something she had n't liked ? Laura 's response was so peculiar that she had no way to understand it . It made her feel hot , apologetic , as if she were about to be sick at the dinner table . It was rare in her experience to so miscalculate , and she did n't know where she had gone wrong . In a minute , Laura was in the room again . She was wearing the dress , the green tights . But she was also wearing the hiking boots that Anne had bought her . Anne felt the color rise in her face . The boots made the dress look ridiculous . Any grace it might have lent to Laura 's body the boots caricatured and made grotesque . Cruelly , deliberately , Anne felt , they mocked the idea of the gift . Laura stood there in the kitchen , staring ahead of her with a perfectly blank face . She looked like a farm wife coming into town to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine that Laura was doing this to punish her , to let her know that she knew that Anne fantasized her improvement . She had to watch out for this new tendency , this suspiciousness that kept rising up in her . Was it living without Michael that was doing it to her ? Was it the pressure of her work ? Was she fulfilling the dire prophecies about women whose work took over their lives ? She was glad she 'd decided to take I , aura to the I lealth Food Restaurant rather than to Marcel 's before Laura had managed to annoy her . Other-  | wise she would have suspected herself of choosing the less expensive restaurant as a punishment . But really , it would have been absurd to spend thirty dollars on a lunch for the two of them . It was n't the sort of thing Laura cared about , she 'd made that very clear . Resentment made Anne feel she had to force the conversation . They talked about the children ; Anne could see that Laura understood them very well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children that so many other people did , and Anne was grateful . By the time the lunch came , she was feeling sympathetic . " When did you lose your parents ? " Anne asked , over dessert . " I did n't . They 're still living , " Laura said , looking at Anne and smiling , as if her mistake were a minor faux pas . " I 'm terribly sorry , Laura . I thought you 'd told the children you had no parents . " " Well , I 'm estranged from my parents . So I thought I 'd just say it that way to the children . I thought they 'd understand it better . " She smiled again . " Do you think I should tell them the truth ? " she asked , in a way that made Anne feel it made very little difference to her one way or another , it was Anne 's responsibility to decide . " I 'm not sure now , Laura , " Anne said , her small reserve of goodwill depleted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . " I 'll have to think about it . On the whole , I try not to lie to them . " " I was n't really lying , Anne , " said Laura , smiling . " I was trying to make it easier for them to understand . " Anne felt the pointlessness of pursuing the topic . With every sentence the problem loomed larger . It was best to let it drop . She was agitated and resentful through the afternoon . There were more of-Caroline 's letters she wanted to read , she was anxious to organize her impressions of the paintings she had seen at Jane 's . And instead she stood in her kitchen , tracing petal shapes on the top of a yellow cake . It made her feel ridiculous . She had done this for the children ; they had liked it so much that she extended the ritual for Michael 's birthday . Like so many things one did for children , it was absurd but pleasing , and the pleasure came from the anticipation of their pleasure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act foolish in itself but capable of being , one imagined , the vessel of memory . Making a cake for Laura was a parody of all that . She probably did n't want it , it would n't make her happy , and instead of the accessible and  | simple feelings of affection she would feel had she been doing this for the children , Anne felt her movements grow jerky with irritation and uneven with dislike . She had to admit it ; she did n't like Laura . Liking  --  you could n't will it : it was n't a quality like courage or fair-mindedness that you could work for . And things could only get worse . Living with Laura , every day there would be new opportunities for annoyance . Love grew through observation , she thought ; the habits of her husband , her children , had grown dear to her ; her knowledge of these habits made up the particulars without which all the feelings they aroused in her would hang on air . But with Laura , each repeated act formed a pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the hardening over , the heaviness she felt when Laura walked into the room . She was afraid she would ruin the cake from ill-feeling , so it took her three times longer to make than it usually did . The children 's excitement made her jittery ; they kept popping into the kitchen to see how she did . Even their determination not to steal small bits of icing , even their praise of her  --  to them  --  incredible craftsmanship , annoyed her . When she heard her name called at the kitchen door and realized it was Ed Corcoran , who 'd been working upstairs , she jumped , like an embezzler who late at night hears the boss 's key . " I 'm going to be switching the lights off and on in the kitchen , so I thought I 'd warn you . I did n't want you to think you were going crazy , or anything . " She smiled at him self-consciously . " Yes , I know what I 'm doing looks like the work of a crazy person , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him about the shape cakes , and as she spoke she saw him grow entranced . " You 're a really nice person , to do that , all that work , you know , for somebody who just works for you . Almost nobody would do that . People treat the people who work for them like things . You 're really thoughtful . I bet she feels alone , away from her family on her birthday and all . " Foolishly , Anne began to blush . Her pleasure at what the man had said was absurd , she told herself . She washed her hands and invited him to have a cup of tea . " You know , it 's something , birthdays , " Ed said . " Before my wife was sick , she used to go all out , for our oldest , you know , Ed Junior . But Brian 's never even had a home-baked birthday cake . She 's just not up to it anymore . I just buy one from the bakery . I feel had , though . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe I 'll try it , next year . I never baked anything , though " " OIi , its not hard I could show you , " Anne said .  | He 'd told her about his wife 's sickness . When she 'd been pregnant with Brian , she 'd developed a brain tumor ; they 'd been told it would be fatal . But instead it had sentenced her to a life of incompetence , with periods of madness , with the constant presence of headaches and the knowledge that the life she lived would always be out of her control . " Imagine me baking a cake . I 'd have to wear an apron . Imagine me in an apron . " He laughed . " Here , let me try yours on for size . " Laughing , she untied her apron and handed it to him . He was such a large man , an apron could only make him look ridiculous . And he played up the ridiculousness , did a little dance around the kitchen , flicking the apron skirt like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I got ta get out of here before your company comes . " He handed her her apron . Slowly she put it on , pleased it had just come from him . She worked happily now , sensing that he watched her , feeling that each thing she did to make the cake look good was winning his regard . She felt herself enlivened by her time with him ; he 'd turned an act of drudgery into a pleasure . And what was wrong with that ? Life was hard enough , she told herself ; it was silly to be suspicious of a pleasure so completely innocent . Adrian was the first to arrive for the party . He walked into the kitchen and embraced Anne as she tried to set out the plates . " I feel I have n't talked to you in a year , " he said . " The other night was worse than nothing . You know how Barbara and I have to be unbearable children in front of you . " She had n't thought of that , but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " she asked . " Oh , because we know you 're so much better than we are , and it drives us crazy . It makes us itchy to torment each other so that you can step in and save us from ourselves . " " Well , whatever you thought about me , these days I 'm barely decent . " " Anne , your idea of bad behavior is like Peter 's idea of great wealth . " She laughed but took his hand so he would know she was serious . " You do n't help me by thinking I 'm better than I am . " " I do n't think you 're better than you arc . I think you 're perfect . What 's worrying you that you 've done ? " " It 's Laura , " she said . " I ca n't make myself like her . I 'm grateful to her for her help , I think she 's fine with the children , but I ca n't make myself feel warm toward her "  | " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's her birthday . " " It 's Hitler 's birthday in April . Maybe you could have a few people over . Anne laughed . " She said she never had a birthday party . And the children wanted it . She 's really had such a sad life . " " What happened to her ? " " I do n't know exactly , but I just feel it . She seems so unloved , so unmothered . So tremendously unhappy . " " It 's not your responsibility to make her happy . " " But she lives in my house . She takes care of my children . And if I can make her happy , I should try . " " What makes you think you can ? " Anne shrugged . " I do n't know . Vanity , maybe . " " Listen , you 're not her mother . You 're her employer . Your responsibility is to pay her a fair wage and not to overwork her . You do n't have to save her life . Look , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vote in the local elections , and be faithful to your husband . You do n't have to take in strays . " " But who will take them in ? " " Someone who needs them . You have more people in your life already than you can handle . " " I hate that , " Anne said . " It 's like everybody else in Selby . The wife , the husband , the boy , the girl , the house , the lawn , the college . And there 's all this life outside , never taken in . " " So take it in , if that 's what you want . " " But I do n't want her . I wish I could get someone else . " " Now , do n't start that . She does a good job for you . That 's all you have to worry about . The kids are doing fine with her , the house is spotless . She never goes out ; she 's not freaked out on drugs or screwing her boyfriend in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the relationship and you 'll be fine . " " I 've already done too much , " said Anne . " I do n't see how I can change it . Look , " she said , pointing to the loaded table . " All right , so this is her birthday . But after tonight , be a little more reserved . Maybe she 'll make more friends and be less dependent on you ; that will case the burden . " " Maybe , " said Anne doubtfully . " What you need is more time with me , " said Adrian . " I 'll show you what it is to he ungenerous . Conic and have hniclh with inc . " " I 'd love it "  | " All right , Tuesday . " Peter ran into the kitchen . " Helene 's here , " he said , like a master of ceremonies . " And now we can begin . " In her green dress , in the candlelight , Laura looked prettier than Anne had ever seen her . She laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciative comments about Peter 's model and Sarah 's turkey . She sniffed happily the lavender soap the Greenspans had bought her , and she tucked one of Adrian 's flowers behind her ear . She propped against the candlestick the framed photograph Helene had given her . It was a beach scene , and on the sky was printed , " Do n't walk ahead of me , I may not follow ; do n't walk behind me , I may not lead ; just walk beside me and be my friend . " Lastly , she wrapped the blue scarf Anne had bought her around her neck . At nine o'clock Howard said he would take the children home to bed . " I just want to thank you all for the happiest birthday of my life . Most of all , I want to thank Anne . For everything . Everything , " she said , kissing Anne 's cheek . Everyone clapped and raised a glass . " To Anne and Laura , " they shouted .  | Anne loved her very much ; Anne loved her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been frightened to wear the dress . It was beautiful . Too beautiful for you , she thought . " You might as well let your sister have all your clothes , you 'll never be anything but ugly . " Was this a trick to make her uglier ? Did Anne want her to say , " This is too pretty for me " ? Was she making fun of Laura by giving her the dress ? Picking it up to put it on for the first time , she held it to her . The bright green , like leaves , the bright small dark flowers . And green tights . They will keep you warm , Anne said . Laura took her pants and sweater off . Her flesh was white and loose . Veins in the back of her legs showed blue . She pulled the green wool tights up on her legs , up past her stomach . Which was white and loose . Standing in front of the mirror , she forgot that the flesh meant nothing , that her round stomach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She pulled the dress over her head . It seemed alive to her . It shone . It lit her face , her hair , which people said was pretty . Standing , looking at herself , she was pleased . Anne had bought her a beautiful dress . Not to make fun of her or to test her . To make her happy . Anne loved her . She would put on the shoes Anne had given her to please her . She walked down the stairs happy , fingering her beautiful dress . Anne was n't happy . She looked at Laura in the dress and said , " Fine , " but she was n't pleased . Just like her parents . Whatever she did , they were n't pleased . She had told the children that she had no parents . That was a mistake .  | They were talking about her birthday . " Are you sad that you wo n't see your parents ? " Quickly the words came out before she thought . Like sparks jumping , the words came , like crackling flames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . She had no parents . But in Matthew she had read , " Brother will deliver up brother to death , and the father his child , and children will rise against parents and have them put to death . " She understood those words . Jesus had said them , meaning blood ties were nothing , meaning leave behind those you were born into . And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands " will be hated by all for my name 's sake . But he who endures to the end will be saved . " Still , she should not have said that to the children . She knew the children loved her . And Anne loved her . Now they were her family . She did n't need her parents or her sister . She smiled , thinking they did n't know where she was , could never trace her . Her father probably worried . Did they call the police when they found she was gone ? No one could find her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copper , nor shoes . No numbers  --  insurance , Social Security , license plates . All those numbers meaning flesh , food and attachments . They could never find her . She was not attached to flesh . She liked to think how jealous they would be of her . What would her mother say , her sister , if they saw the party that Anne made for her ? Made because she wanted to , she did n't have to . And the presents . she knew how much the dress cost . She had seen it in the window of that store . Seventy dollars . They would never pay that much . On sale they might have bought it , waiting , waiting , waiting till they saw no one else wanted it . But Anne saw it and bought it , saw it shining in the window . Full of love for Laura , Anne went in and paid them all that money . At first Laura had been afraid . Of course , it was so beautiful . The green , the flowers . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . What would her mother say to her room ? The house Anne lived in Laura 's mother dreamed of , read about in magazines , but never entered . All the furniture was old and strong . The furniture would never fail here . The legs would not come off the couch , the stuffing would not break through chairs and fall onto the rug and stay there . In her mother 's house the surfaces were made to he shiny , but her mother let them get dull , let rings from glasses set like faces , let the slipcovers hunch up , let Kleenex fall behind the cushions , let cigarettes , hobby pins , shoes lie under chairs , and let the can of hair spray sit on the table . Everything in , Anne 's house  | was valuable . She polished things until they shone . The feel of cloth was never stiff , it did not smell of paste or oil . The colors did not shout like her mother 's colors . Even when her mother tried to keep the colors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here things were deep . They did not fly up , fly off , strike the eyes with anger . Her room was a hollow , a valley , a light field . The floors were light and wooden . The small rug beside her bed lay quiet at her feet . The curtains lay in folds . In the morning , sun came to her room , settled on her tables , chairs , her dresser , never glaring . Her sister would be jealous of her room . And what would they think of the party Anne had made for her ? They would never be able to meet anyone like the people who sat around that table , singing to her , honoring her , giving her presents . Three professors , two professors ' wives . One professor was Adrian . Her mother would never get to meet anyone like Adrian . Maybe if she took a job at the dry cleaner 's , she would get to hand him his shirts . But he would never talk to her . He would never give her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she was a good listener . He was the handsomest man she had ever seen , with his thick gray curly hair , his open shirts , his shoulders . When he came to speak to Anne , she said that Anne was busy , Anne was working , she did n't want to disturb her . But really she wanted to be in the room with him without Anne there . With Anne in the room , it would be Anne that he would talk to . If she went on and listened to Adrian , looked into his eyes when he told her things , praised whatever he said , he would someday like her more than he liked Anne . What would her parents think if she married Adrian ? If she drove up with him to the house in his Volkswagen Rabbit , not having told them anything , not having seen them in two years . If she married him in Anne 's house with the house all full of flowers from the garden . It was winter now , but in spring the garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and purple with dark green leaves . At her wedding , they would fill the house . If she married Adrian , she could always live near Anne . Live in Selby in a house like Anne 's , near her , right on the street . She would teach the people all about the Spirit . Teach them that their lives were not important . She would he living their lives but not living them . They would love her but she would not love hack as much . Because she still would have the Spirit . They would have to stay but she might leave at any time because she knew that attachments mean nothing . And leaving , she would teach them that . qwq  | Saint James knew about people like Jane . " You have lived on the earth in luxury and pleasure ; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter . You have condemned , you have killed the righteous man ; he does not resist you . Jane condemned Laura ; she could feel it . But Laura would resist her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Spirit and that she , Jane , drowned in flesh . She could see the pictures burning and Anne burning in the flame . But she could save Anne from the flame . Jane wished to harm her from the envy of the Spirit . When Laura helped her with the dishes on Thanksgiving , Jane asked , " What will you do when your work with Anne is over ? " It will never be over , I will be with her always , Laura thought , but said , " I take the next thing that comes along . Something always turns up . " " And have you education ? " Jane said . " High school , but there 's nothing I want to learn in college . " " What do you want to do with your life , then ? " Jane said . Laura smiled , knowing her work , the work of the Spirit . " I just do the next thing that comes along . I like working with kids , but I do n't care much what I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something turns up . " " But what is it you want from life ? " Jane asked . Laura could feel the woman 's back go tight ; she was getting angry . " I do n't want things ; I do n't need things to make me happy . " " Surely you want things , " the woman said , " friends , love , food , clothing , shelter . " Laura smiled , knowing she was the chosen of the Lord . " I do n't need a whole lot to get by , " she said . She would have to be wise . Her saving Anne would not be as easy as it would if Jane were not among them . The strong enemy . The chosen of the Lord were harshly treated . " Remember 0 Lord how the enemy scoffs and an impious people reviles thy name . Do not deliver the soul of thy dove to the wild beast . " She , Laura , was the dove , she knew . She loved and wished to shelter . With her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard thoughts . She prayed for Jane , her enemy . That she would see the Spirit . Now Jane was the beast that would devour . Devour the soul of the dove . Her breath was hot , her eyes glowed red . She wanted to run at Laura with her strong thick body . She would tear , if she could , the dove 's flesh with her teeth . And yet she would not conquer . Laura knew herself wise and powerful ; she knew now she would triumph . Now she knew Anne loved her , Laura would save Anne from the flame .  | Coming downstairs for lunch , Anne saw Adrian in the kitchen . " What a nice surprise , " she said . " Is this our day for lunch ? " " No , Laura 's invited me out . " " Oh , fine , " Anne said . There was no justice in what she was feeling . Laura had a perfect right to take whomever she wanted out for lunch . Of course a young woman would think Adrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attentions ? Really , the fault was with Adrian if it was with anybody : he should have known that he would turn the head of a girl like Laura . He should stop things before they had a chance to get started . But suppose he did n't want to ? Suppose he enjoyed her company ? Suppose he found her attractive ? She herself had thought that in a lover 's eyes Laura could seem voluptuous . And certainly Adrian knew how to look with a lover 's eye : she had always been surprised and rather touched by the catholicity of his taste in women  --  a diner waitress with varicose veins , a librarian in her sixties . And it would be good for Laura to have as a lover someone experienced and patient . She was so unhappy . Maybe it was n't familial love that she needed , after all , which was why Anne 's dealings with her had been so baffled . Perhaps it was a lover that she needed . But she begrudged Laura Adrian . She had n't thought herself possessive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , she had to see it . She had n't minded Adrian 's women ; she had looked at his sexual life with a mixture of amusement and disapproval , but nothing he had ever done had struck her as this had . Perhaps it was that the women she knew him t() be involved with seemed always to be one or another kind of prize . They were heanti fill , accomplished , sexy , witty , or at least exotic She cuulcl feel herself  | valued in his valuing of them . If he thought her attractive , and he thought them attractive , there had to be some commonality . The thought of commonality with Laura disturbed her . Simply , she felt that Adrian 's being attracted to Laura took away from her own worth . Laura appeared at the door . She was wearing the dress Anne had bought her . When she walked into the kitchen , Anne recognized the scent of her own perfume , Fleurs de Rocaille . For Christmas , the year before , Michael had given her an ounce of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had her own . She might , for example , have bought it at the duty-free shop at Heathrow before she got on the plane , choosing it randomly , because of the name , perhaps . She looked up at Laura , trying to smile . Something else was different about her : she was wearing eye shadow . It was green , the same color as Anne 's . But the shadow was common , it could be bought in any drugstore ; she had n't necessarily borrowed Anne 's . And Anne would never finally know , for she would never be able to ask Laura . Adrian was holding Laura 's sweater , and she was smiling over her shoulder at him . Why did Laura have such power in her life ? She had only to smile over her shoulder at Adrian , to wear green eye shadow , and Anne felt her skin harden over like a rind . But she was n't the only one to feel Laura 's power . It had been a great relief to her to overhear an exchange between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She wanted to see Anne . Laura said she could n't , Anne was working . And Ianthe , who could stand up to cardinals in the Vatican Museum , salespeople at Bergdorf 's or Mark Cross , nurses of Park Avenue specialists , had n't been able to get around Laura . Anne had seen Ianthe contemplating simply pushing past Laura . But she checked herself . It was like a rapier trying to get through a bolster ; possibly it could be accomplished , but not with a single , simple thrust , and even Ianthe was able to calculate the carnage . So Laura had prevailed . She was powerful because she was immobile . Nothing broke her surface ; it was all smooth heaviness . She was unsusceptible to humor or to charm . Her interest in Adrian , Anne thought , had nothing to do with his wit or sweetness . She must be interested in him because he so clearly looked as if he would have the endurance necessary to perform . She hated the thought of Adrian and Laura making love . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same fixity of purpose that she had when she moved the refrigerator to clean behind it . It was unbearable , the things that Laura made her feel . She could have gone through her whole life wit lion ' feeling then ( . It was I , aura 's presence with her in the house , it was the life she had to live beside her that made these antipathies so brutish and so real  | She must forget about Laura . She would go back to work . That was the important thing , the essential thing . Because of Laura , she could turn to Caroline 's diaries . There was nothing around the house that needed her attention . So she could put up with Laura , because all the qualities that so annoyed her made Laura the perfect servant . Her dullness , her lack of imagination , kept her from being bored ; they made her happy at her job . So that Anne could turn to Caroline 's journal and read what Caroline , sitting in her house on the Hudson River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . I can not paint . I look at people , at the river , and I know what is called for . Yet I can do nothing . American skies do me no good . They suggest nothing to me , only some vast stupid openness concealing unimportance . If only I could do something simple : an apple or a branch . To draw as if I were a cobbler , making something ordinary , useful : a pair of boots . If once again the look of things could move me . When M. Matisse had influenza and thought he was dying , he said he was glad he had lived because of his birds , his gardens , they had been so beautiful . If only I could feel that once again : that itch so that the press of human things washed over me : a heavy wave I was not in the path of . The sun on the leaves : a light , acidic green . Once nothing could distract me from it . The existence of Stephen dulls everything , muddles everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others twists them for me . Because she dotes on him , I see my sister , whom I love , as a fool . My father , who could raise in me a grudging pride , I now despise entirely . His attentions to my son turn him into the complete American , Philistine and boor . When he tells Stephen , " Get out into the open . Do n't mope around . Do something , be a real boy , " I could strike my father to the heart . Yet I too despise my son for his slowness , his misery . My son . I know where he is . He sits outside my door , waiting for me to finish . I can hear his breath through walls a foot thick . His breath steals mine and blinds me . Sitting out there , covered over with unhappiness , waiting only for the word , the touch I can not give him , he imagines that , behind the door , I work . I hear his governess tell him to stop sitting by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to hear a story . He will not move . Poor Stephen at the door , four years old , waiting , doing exactly the wrong thing , what would never gain his mother 's affection , only her impatience . And poor Caroline , trapped in her room , pressed down , rubbed raw by irritation , guilt , contempt , the fear she could not work , Three months  | a year she gave to Stephen : months wrung grudgingly from a dried skin . Leaving Paris , her life , she boarded ships , crossed seas . To get to what ? Her son , whose flesh made hers grow cold . Yet in the paintings of him , she had rendered his flesh beautiful . Her freest brushwork , pinks and purples , blues spread quickly , lovingly , made up the flesh of the boy 's limbs in Stephen , Sleeping . When her father scolded Stephen , she was ready to take knives , to strike him to the heart . Yet around the child she could not breathe . Still , she came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Off the boat she swept , by him , above him , covering them both in a miserable cloud of failure and incomprehension , while she tapped her fingers on the windowsills of the house that had been built by Dutch settlers in the 1600 's , and smoked , impatiently , a hundred cigarettes a day to spite her father . Then on September first she left , lifting the cloud and leaving Stephen even more defenseless , naked to the devastating blast of manly expectation , which would only make him wither , sicken , fall into his own unlucky nature , his own sinking heart . Anne looked at the sketchbooks of those summers . She could see that Caroline was learning in those drawings a new line , quick and bold . She could see it in the drawings of the branches , in the thick line marking the horizon , in the spare , sure strokes suggesting doors and windows . Caroline sat in her room desolated , convinced she was marking time at worthless labor . Yet those drawings were critical to what she achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Caroline , to Stephen , if they had known those heavy , lacerating hours would lead to something ? Would Caroline have loved her son more if she had known that what she did while he sat outside the door would point the way to her best work ? Would Stephen the child have thought to himself , I am lonely , but it is leading to something ? Of course not . Nothing could have helped them . There was no connection between art and life . The backward glance was nothing , or a lie . They had to live their lives . They could only be themselves , Caroline in her room , made miserable by the miserable son who sat outside the door breathing unhappily the air she needed . The house in the morning thrummed with expectation . The morning sunlight , weak and ordinary , took on purpose . For the children , life was shining : they were going to the city . A wave of strangers would engulf them , beautiful , treacherous , and carry them on . They might see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder . It was nearly Christmas . Stores would be lit up , lights would be strung through the dense air .  | Formally , they walked into Jane 's building . Her apartment was small and circumspect ; it was clear that her domestic life was lived in the country . The walls of all the rooms were white . They had been covered with Caroline 's paintings and were nearly bare . Square drab chairs sat on the living room rug like grounded birds . The curtains were a somber green . " Come in , my dears , come in , " said Jane , sweeping the children forward . " I 'd like you to meet my friend Betty Loomis . " Jane had told Anne not to bring Laura ; she said a woman who did some work for her would be happy to care for the children . It was a pleasure for Anne to be away from Laura for a day ; it was a pleasure , even , to feel she was in league with Jane in excluding her . Would Laura spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Betty 's staying with me for the winter , " Jane said . " She 's been helping me around the house . " Betty Loomis was sitting in one of the chairs as if she would be happiest disappearing into it . Her poor thin shoulders folded in toward the center of her body like a coat hanger stepped on by heavy feet in boots . Her hair ? five colors , none of them distinct  --  was pulled back in a red elastic band ; there were reddish-brownish patches underneath her eyes suggesting she might have been rubbing them in a particularly violent , desperately habitual way . Her eyes were large and light , covered by a thin , pervasive film of misery , endurance , patience , and bad luck . She wore black ski pants and a Ban-Lon sweater in a shade that twenty years before had been called , too hopefully , royal blue . On her feet were ballet slippers , the thin laces at the instep tied in two neat bows . " Where are you from originally ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fearful that Jane 's physical abundance , all her size and color , might be too much for this girl if she added her own to it . " Florida , " she said . " My people were from Florida at first . I was n't actually brought up there . I lived in Georgia for a while , then Alabama . I came here in 1978 . " " Yes , of course you did , " said Jane . " Now , children , you must be very good and do exactly what Betty says , and more , for she 's very kind , and I 'm afraid you 'll find her easy to take advantage of . We 'll he back at four , and then we 'll go right off , Betty , so you must see to yourself for dinner . " Betty nodded , tapping a cigarette on the arm of the chair . " You should n't smoke . The surgeon general has determined that cigarette smoking can he hazardous to your health , " Peter said . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I'licre 's a very gcxxl t ) lrasc , ' Every mall to his own poison . ' You may not have found yours yet , but you will . "  | Peter fell back on the couch , blushing . Anne was afraid he was going to cry . He was , after all , in love with Jane . Betty Loomis sat down on the couch beside him . " I know you said that because you cared . Thank you , that means a lot to me . " She said the word cared as if it had three syllables . Peter 's body corkscrewed into the upholstery with pleasure . Like all moralists , Anne thought , he was at heart a sentimentalist . He would probably marry a country and western singer and spend the rest of his life trying to teach her Greek . Anne kissed the children and gave them each a dollar . Walking down the hall , she wondered what peculiar accident had brought Betty Loomis into Jane 's life . She was obviously more than an employee . Standing behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never dare to ask about it , and she thought it at least possible that Jane might never say a thing about it . Jane was the kind of person who was always puzzled when people found her arrangements unusual . With the extreme isolation of the genuinely self-possessed , Jane thought herself the norm . Anne had given the people in the gallery the list she had put together of the paintings of Caroline Watson owned by collectors . Today she would meet the gallery people for lunch , to talk about contacting the collectors and perhaps borrowing some of the paintings for the show . She had seen photographs of only a few of them in exhibition catalogues of the twenties and the thirties . So she was counting on Ben  --  and Jane  --  to advise her about which of the paintings might be important to pursue . They were to meet the people from the gallery at a Japanese restaurant . Their choice of restaurant made Anne even more nervous . A business lunch at a Japanese restaurant . It implied , to Anne , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to distinguish themselves , these people , from lawyers , stockbrokers , publishers , who sweated in other places over large , dark hunks of meat and , like barbarians , grunted their transactions . She had eaten at a Japanese restaurant only once , in Boston , when she had worked at the Gardner . She remembered thinking it was wonderful , the way the things were done : the small , rolled pieces of fish with their alien coloring and textures , the hot green horseradish , the soup one drank from a bowl one lifted up , the green ice cream that tasted as if it had been made of leaves . Ben and the two young men at the table rose to greet Anne and Jane ; the two young women , seated next to each other , smiled slightly to the kit of Anne 's head . Anne was introduced to them ; the men were Charles  | and Daniel , the women Cressida and Jill . She was glad to sit down quickly . The four people made her feel like some gross creature shipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their clothes had sharp angles . The men wore suits cut close to their slight bodies with thin lapels and thin dark ties . Cressida wore a jacket of a brass-colored soft leather with hard wide shoulders . Jill was entirely in black , and her ankle-length boots were a silver version of the leather of Cressida 's jacket . Sitting in her gray wool skirt and tweed jacket , Anne felt dowdy and parvenu . That she was dressed in a mode at least recognizably similar to Jane 's brought her no comfort . Jane was forty years older than she ; these people were more nearly her contemporaries . " Tell me about that divine pasta you got , Daniel , " said Charles . " I want to know everything . " " Well , it 's this place in the West Village . this absolutely adorable , tiny , absolutely ancient lady makes it in the back every day . I swear she grinds her own wheat . " " Of course , the pasta in America is inedible if you 've spent any time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I know a place that has the most amazing blend of coffee . It 's their own , but it really tastes European . " " Obviously , there is no such thing as European coffee . Or American . It has to do with the grinding , the blending and the preparation , " Jane said , putting on her glasses to look at the menu . " Yes , of course , " said Cressida , " but if you drink what passes in America for coffee you 're drinking dishwater . " " That 's nonsense , " said Jane . " One can easily get good coffee here . " " I ca n't drink coffee anyway , " said Charles . " Half my salary goes to Zabar 's to get their decaffeinated . At least I can get Ferrerelle there . " " I do n't understand this craze for mineral water , " said Jane . " It 's fine mixed with something , but people nowadays seem to drink it plain . " " It does n't have any calories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the mention of calories made her feel she should have a weapon close at hand . " But it does n't taste good , " said Jane . " One might as well drink nothing . " " I think it 's got a kind of fascinating , ascetic taste , " said Daniel . " People do n't enjoy eating and drinking the way they used to . Do n't you agree , Ben ? " said Jane . " Absolutely , " said Ben . " And they look the worse for it . In niy day , women looked like Anne and Jane , with flesh they were proud of and a good color . "  | " I think Americans eat too much , " said Jill . " Of course they do , " said Charles , " but it 's all shit . I mean if you look at the way a French or Italian peasant eats ... Jane was looking into the middle distance , clearly bored . Ben turned to Anne and spoke to her about the children 's Christmas presents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four young people and turned his attention exclusively to Anne . This made her feel worse . She imagined they thought he had selected her to do the catalogue because she was his mistress . From time to time , one of the four would try to get Ben 's attention . They wanted his approval or his contact ; he was famous , he was influential , he had access to wealth and property . Miserably she ate the several courses of her meal . Not one word had been said about the paintings . As they rose to leave , Ben said , " I think we all agree that the selection of the paintings in private collections should be left entirely to Mrs. Foster . She is the best qualified of us to judge . " " Of course , " said Charles . " Remarkable piece of research you 've done . Just remarkable . " " I guess you have a lot of free time in the country where you live . No distraction . Nothing to see , no other shows . No place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sweet town . It must be very peaceful , " said Cressida . Was she trying to understand or deliberately misunderstanding ? Anne felt she outweighed the girl by fifty pounds . " Really great work you 've done , " said Jill . " First-rate . Going to be a major show . " " Thank you , " said Anne . She felt that they despised her . In the cab on the way to her apartment Jane said , " That 's what I call a nasty piece of work , those four affected sillies . " " They did n't say a word about Caroline 's work , " said Anne , feeling close to tears . She felt they 'd slighted Caroline ; it was as if they 'd slighted one of the children . " They 're afraid to in front of you , " said Ben . " They do n't know anything , and they 're afraid to reveal themselves before an expert . " " I see how you would frighten them , " said Anne . " Not me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know more about Caroline Watson than anybody in the world . " Anne looked out the window . Afraid of her ? No one in her life had been ; afraid of her . " Where : arc the children ? " Ben asked . " In nay apartment , " said Jane .  | " Who 's looking after them ? " " Betty . " " Betty the Basher ? " " Ben , " said Jane angrily . " You 're much too old to be puerile . " " Giving her a second chance with Peter and Sarah , are you ? Well , I suppose Peter 's old enough to look out for himself and his sister . " " Of course he is , " said Jane haughtily . " When she hurt her children they were much smaller . " " Hurt her children ? " asked Anne with anxiety . " She had a few unfortunate incidents at a time when she was mentally unstable . But she 's much better now . Anyone can see that . " Alarmed , Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my children with a child abuser ? " " You say the phrase , Anne , as if that were all there was to her identity . There is much more to her besides . She 's a brave person , with tremendous loyalty . " " Besides , darling , Jane 's rehabilitating her . So we must all be part of the experiment . " " Of course , I would n't have done this if I were n't quite sure she was trustworthy . I met her last year , when I was volunteering to teach people to read . " " She ca n't read ? " Anne said , as if that made the woman more unreliable . " Well , she can now . I 've taught her . She 's had a most dreadful life . She got pregnant at sixteen . Her boyfriend married her , then joined the army , impregnating her twice more , then vanishing without a trace . Her mother was an alcoholic , her father half dead of emphysema . They told her they could n't help her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of helping her . She got on a bus with her children  --  three days she was on a bus with them . When she arrived in New York , she knew no one . She lived in a single room in the West forties and worked as a waitress in a donut shop . The one man she met who was kind to her left her eventually because he could n't stand being around her children . One day , after she 'd picked up the children from a wretched day care center , her four-year-old , in a fit of temper , knocked over a gallon of milk . Before she knew what happened , she 'd broken his arm . Well , she was absolutely undone by it . She called the child abuse center , and they set her up with a counselor . Her life 's infinitely better now , I 'm sure she never heats children anymore . But her children are iii foster homes now  --  if I told her she could n't take care of your children , it would he a terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might have asked me first , " said Anne . " Well , my dear , I knew you 'd feel just as I do . We 're terribly alike ; we could be mother and daughter . " All Anne 's anger melted at the intimacy Jane implied . It was absurd , of course ; she was nothing like Jane ; she could live a hundred years and never would be . But it was an honor even to have Jane imagine it . She could n't say now what she wanted to say : How could you have put my children in danger ? Child abuse was understandable ; one could easily see why it happened all the time . In the three years when she had been home all day with the children , her own frustration had shocked her , the boredom that led to irritation at the smallest thing . But she thought of the flesh of her children , and the flesh of the woman who had abused her children took on the odor of contamination . You did not hurt your children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did in the world if you were a mother . She ran up the stairs of Jane 's building . The children were sitting happily on the floor with Betty doing a jigsaw puzzle . " We had a great time , " Sarah said . Anne hugged them , dizzy with relief . Looking at Betty , she thought of Laura with gratitude . She was boring , she was irritating , but she was utterly dependable . However much she intruded on the peace of Anne 's inner life or , Anne thought unhappily , upon her own self-love , she never had to worry if her children were unsafe when they were with Laura . The sky was zinc-colored that morning . Anne leaned her cheek against the windowpane ; the cold glass reminded her how lucky she was to be indoors , it made her happy to get back to work . She heard Ed Corcoran working downstairs . He 'd asked if he could bring his son Brian on days when something went wrong at home and his sister could n't baby-sit . Anne had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wife whenever she watched Brian Corcoran sitting on the floor , playing seriously with his toys , out of his father 's way , but never allowing himself to move too far from the protective nimbus cast by his father 's body . How were children attached to their father 's bodies , where they had never lived , she wondered . Michael 's attachment to the children had always seemed so different from hers . When they were babies , she physically ached for them if she was away from them . At night before she went to sleep , she had to restrain herself from lifting them out of their cribs , she wanted so much to have them near her , to put her mouth  | against their cheeks , their hair . She knew their bodies better than Michael did , for she tended them more , and they had lived closer to her body . They had lived in the curves her body made while she nursed them ; she had felt their small , primitive fingers tapping , running up her torso . Flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She had n't thought so . Michael 's passion for the children was a remove farther from the body . There was a kind of nostalgia about it , as if in holding his children he was holding the child he wished he had been . He never saw himself as once the flesh that housed them ; he did n't see it as a miracle that they got through one whole day of their lives alone . This made it easy for him to give their natures a moral credit she always had to strain after . But it was different for Brian Corcoran . Safety to him was his father . A mother 's safety was a bolster this poor child would never know . But was he a poor child ? He seemed happy . Anne admired him ; it did n't seem inappropriate in his case to use the word " admire " for a three-year-old . He took part in the world of work . He was a serious person . She could never have left her children with as little attention as Ed left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his father , but happy nowhere else . He played shyly for brief periods with Peter , who loved small children and was talented with them , but always his glance flicked nervously toward his father . She could see the child 's eyes lift with alarm when his father left the room , then drop down again in peace when he could see his father near him . She watched them eat their lunch together , heard Ed talking to his son as she talked to her children , but most men did not , familiarly with an element of gossip and confiding . Ed Corcoran was very tall ; six three , she guessed . It was a pleasure for her to stand near him ; he made her feel  --  a thing she rarely felt with men ? not oversized . She remembered Barbara 's flirtatious giggles over the blue pages of his estimate and realized she was attracted to Ed too . Were all the women he did work for secretly in love with him ? Because he was a nice man , and there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those big houses ? It was strange to her , this feeling of being attracted . She had felt it before , of course . It was a scintillating feeling , but always before , Anne had been stopped by the solid presence of her husband and the physical life of marriage . Was she in danger , alone in the house with a nlan she found desirable ? No , Ed Corcoran was n't the man she would betray her husband with . There would always he , in her coupling wit Ii I 'd , something comic ; they were both so large , so shy , so lacking in the case of quick seduction .  | She would have to be taken over by someone , and Ed was much too nice for that . He would allow her hesitation , and in hesitating she would always choose fidelity . And what would they talk about ? He was an electrician . Yet they seemed to have a lot to say . They talked about their children . He asked if he could work some nights from ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife asleep as well . If something went wrong , his older son , who was ten , could telephone him here . He asked her that after she had confessed that she worked till midnight . How could she refuse him ? She had no inclination to . It was peaceful , knowing everyone in her house was asleep except the two of them , who stayed up working . Soldiers on watch , nurses in a battle hospital . At midnight she came down and offered him a cup of tea . So it had come to that : every night at midnight she drank tea with a man nothing like her husband . It was a good thing Michael was coming home soon . He would be there in ten days . But she was in no danger from Ed Corcoran . He would never make the first move . Largely , she supposed , for reasons of class . Still , she enjoyed talking to him every evening ; she was sorry that that would stop . She would tell him that when her husband came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , as he did for everyone else . Certainly , though , today she could ask him and his little boy to join her for lunch . There could n't possibly be anything wrong with that . But she would n't allow herself to go downstairs and greet them yet . She made herself finish transcribing the passage in Caroline 's journal she was working on . June 15 , 1920 Arques-la-Bataille So I am an " older painter . " A troop of trousered English girls arrive at the door , expecting lunch and the freest of accesses to my studio , to say nothing of my life . They imagine they are not vain , but they are as vain as courtesans about their trousers . How they horrify me ; yet they are the culmination of all my dreams . If only I , at twenty , had been able to bicycle through the countryside with painting chums , visiting the studios of " older painters , " what could I not have done ! Yet freedom has only coarsened them ; they paint like demented children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have understood Matisse . To them I am elderly , in long skirts , with thick ankles .

What they want in their hearts is a brute who 'll throw them down the stairs and sweat above them in a drunken stupor . What an odd letter that was . It always pleased Anne to see Caroline display any fondness for Stephen ; it made her feel she could relax her vigilance , he was not quite alone . But it made her sad to see Caroline so vindictive about the young women painters . Her response to them meant , of course , that she was beginning to get old . Why did it always happen , the rebellious young turned punitive in middle age ? Perhaps , Anne thought , since she 'd been conservative in youth , in age she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman with young children ; she could n't possibly do anything remotely dangerous ; anything dangerous she did would be dangerous to them . The whole shape of her life must be constructed to make her children safe . She could n't even have an affair with her electrician ! Almost reluctantly , she went downstairs to invite Ed to lunch . They were waiting for Michael in the airport . The plane was an hour late , and the children could hardly bear the excitement . She gave up trying to keep them close to her ; she told them where their father would be coming out and said they must n't stray too far from that spot . Peter , who was nothing if not farsighted , had brought a month 's allowance with him , simply to squander . This made Sarah cry ; she had n't brought any money , and Anne , pitying her exclusion from so sumptuous and meaningless a feast , gave her a two-dollar advance on her allowance . Then Peter was angry ; he stamped his feet , accusing his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister had forgotten the money she should suffer . Suffer was the word he used , and it made Anne shiver . Sternly she said to him , " There 's enough suffering in this world . " Peter took her statement for an august utterance , and it chastened him into silence . He always liked , she knew , the runic generalization ; it suggested to him that adults were opening the curtain , letting him into a truth he always knew was there but that they had kept from him . Sarah walked ahead of her brother , occasionally hopping . Money had bestowed its grace on her ; she had no need of conversation . Anne had asked Laura to stay home . She did n't want her with the family for their first glimpse of Michael . She knew that no one else was as bothered by Laura as she was . Barbara made fun of her , but Barbara made fun of everyone . Adrian had lunch with her , he took her to the movies . 1 ) nI he sleep with her ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane disliked her , but Anne suspected Jane of snobbery , of class or of religion , she could n't be sure which . Anne was anxious to learn what Michael 's response to Laura would be . She depended upon him for justice . It was n't because he was a man ; she did n't believe men had born in them a greater capacity for justice . It was that Michael valued reason more than she did , and that justice in their lives was as real and valuable , solid and living to him , as it was vague , impalpable , to her . His justice had helped them again and again . His reasonableness , like a simple bridge , had carried them over nights of babies crying , through financial crisis , through the cruelties of friends , the failures of sex . If it were not for his justice , she would n't have been able to have this year , to do her work . He was coming out the door now ; he was walking toward her . She had waited so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much , that for a moment she did n't recognize him . She stood still , afraid to move forward , afraid that this man who appeared to be her husband was the mere invention of desire . Then she felt herself pushed forward . The pleasure of touching the body that was , indeed , her husband 's sang in her ears as if she had come up too quickly from beneath the sea . The children ran against him , clinging to his legs . She would n't move away from him to give them more access . She had to hold him ; she kissed him ten times on the face . She kept kissing his shoulder , disbelieving her good fortune . How handsome he was . The facts of his body came back gradually to her . How odd it was that a body so well known , so deeply loved , could allow itself in absence to be even partially forgotten . It was a surprise to her how slight he was , how fine and straight and light his hair was ; only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , never , even when he smiled , relinquishing a kind of sadness  --  were entirely familiar . His beauty was a simple joy to her ; she allowed herself to bask in it as if it were any natural phenomenon : sunshine or fragrant air . She was sure the people near him must have been refreshed simply by sitting with him on a plane . " We 're insane , " he said , kissing her hair , leaving his hands free to pet the children . " Why did we leave each other for one day ? I did n't think it was possible to miss anyone as much as I missed you . " " I 've missed you , I 've missed you , " she kept saying , not knowing now how she had done it , lived without him , lived without his voice , his body . Walking beside him , leaning into him , carrying one bag for him while he carried the other , she understood that these months she had kept her body 's life shut down . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was light with effortless goodwill . The children chattered the three hours back to Selby She was silent . She kept leaning over iii the car , kissing  | the top of his arm , putting her head on his shoulder . Soon he would be gone again . She must n't think of it . For three weeks she would have him near her . He took her fingers , kissed them , put them carefully on her lap . The children would be asleep soon . Then all that dark night , she would have him to herself . She was in the bathroom with Michael . He was shaving ; she had just come from the shower and was standing to the left of his shoulder , in front of the mirror , taking pins out of her hair . The slightly overheated air , the dampness in the atmosphere , the smell of soap , created a breathy hopefulness in the room , and Anne could look at herself with a simple , physical happiness . Her shoulders still were n't quite dry ; she touched them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she kissed him over and over . All night they had held each other , and now the day would be theirs . They would go into stores ; they would buy things for the children ; they would have lunch , sitting across from each other in a restaurant , touching each other 's hands . In the evening , they would have people to dinner . She would sit at the opposite end of their dining room table , and he would watch her with a slow , sexual pride as people lifted glasses , forks , sharing their happiness . The children were shy with their father ; she sent them out late in the afternoon , when the too-early darkness made the air exciting , to take a walk while she cooked . The heavy smells of winter cooking hung in the house , everything was charged with a false , seasonal excitement , but under it all was the jet of sexual love once more heating things , making her feel what all those months had been absent . She 'd found it easier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked her simple questions , natural questions , that Anne , fearing either an answer she would n't want to live in the house with or a wound too near the surface , had n't asked . So she 'd learned the name of Laura 's hometown , that she had a sister , a high school education only and no hopes for more . With Michael near , Anne felt less open to access , several sheets protected her from Laura 's yearning . Marriage muffled , it protected , it made it much more difficult to he generous because you were always kept back a little from the lives of others , and so from feeling their need . She was able to be in the kitchen with Laura now , to accept her help with dinner , with none of the anxiety she 'd felt a week ago . Possibly , she thought , Michael 's visit would make t heir relationship normal ; he would teach her how to be with this girl who , he 'd reminded her , was unsettling simply because she was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , she was able to believe him . Laura even seemed happier with him around . When he came home with the children and changed his clothes , all of them sat in the kitchen , doing something to help with dinner , and Laura sang Christmas carols along with the rest of them as if she actually once , too , had lived in a family , had had a home . Anne had invited Helene for dinner on Michael 's second night home . She arrived an hour early . She could almost mar the surface of the evening ; she could almost make a parody of it , with her clapped hands , her cooing , her saying to Anne : " But what a genius you have for family life . I ca n't imagine you would want another work . It is for people that your gift is . Why , the change in Laura is extraordinary . She tells me she has never in her life been so happy . " Then she had to pull Michael from the center of them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news of her friends , so that the weight of the room shifted and everyone looked toward them with a deprived , hungry imbalance , longing to be let in . She was giggling , she was coming at Michael 's face with a series of playful slaps ; she was telling him how everyone in Toulouse was made for him . " Speaking of which I got a telephone call , a telephone call , my dear , from Charlotte Mistiere . Purporting , she has said , to wish me joyeux Noel , but one knows how parsimonious she is . The real reason , of course , was to inquire of your health . It is a genuine conquest you have made , my friend , and with the most prestigious hostess in the town . At forty , her dinners have put out of joint all the older noses of the town dowagers . She is famous for them . " " She 's been quite kind to me , " Michael said . Something rose up in the air , something sharp , elusive , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark fish possessed of rows of clever teeth , not yet visible . Michael was uncomfortable . Anne could see it ; she knew him better than anybody in the world . Twice , three times in the seventeen years she 'd known him , he had blushed . He was doing it now ; he pulled his sweater down over his hips like a schoolboy . The hard object in the air flew apart , broke into tiny pieces that were hooks , embedded themselves in her skin and disappeared there . Was that it , did Michael have a lover ? Charlotte Mistiere . Would she have to think of that as the name of the woman she shared her husband with ? No one would he surprised to hear it ; he was a young man , a handsome man , he was away from home . She must put it out of her mind . It was true or it was not , and she would have no way of knowing . She could never ask him .  | For that was what they had agreed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other would not be told . They 'd made the decision three years ago when Michael 's best friend from college had come to Selby for a week 's colloquium and had propositioned Anne . Michael had had an evening class ; she 'd come home late with Roger after a wine-and-cheese party . She 'd had too much to drink . They 'd been making fun of people ; they were laughing the way they had the last time she 'd seen him , in a Cambridge apartment . They were laughing , then they were kissing ; it had all happened terribly fast . " Come to bed with me , " he said , " I 've wanted to go to bed with you for fifteen years . " The thought of it had made life seem brimful and swimming . She could do it ; she could love her husband , she could have a lover . She would talk to him about it , no one would get hurt . In her mind she imagined that Roger would come to town once every few months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't mean she loved Michael less ; it would just mean life was richer . They drank more wine ; they did more kissing . She sent Roger home and said she would speak to Michael when he came in . Dizzy with wine , she told her husband her wonderful news . His reaction shocked her . He brought his hand down , flat on the surface of the table , like the blade of a wide knife . The wineglasses jumped ; small wet pools formed beside them . " Do it or do n't do it , but do n't talk to me about it , " he had said . " Do n't ask me if it 's all right . It 's not all right . " And he had walked up the stairs , to their bed . All night he 'd slept as if he slept on the edge of a cliff , as if to move one inch closer to her would be like falling into a dangerous ocean . In the morning she woke , feeling like a murderer . Guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spread behind her eyes . It had marked the end of their young marriage , what she had done , having drunk too much , in just one evening . It had n't been the end of everything ; life came in , covered the bare patch of torn-up earth with the architecture of family life , but she 'd had to live with the knowledge that she had done damage to the person in the world whom she most loved . That knowledge led to a resolve : she would never be unfaithful to him . And , months later , when they were able , finally , to speak of it , they 'd promised each other , if they were unfaithful , they would keep it to themselves . It had seemed mature then , and sensible . But now she found it dreadful . How could she go through this time she had so longed for if she suspected Michael of having a lover and could never know the truth . Suddenly all she had taken pleasure iii stood up and mocked her . What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like holidays , bolstering things up with them , spreading things around them . Making of them some sort of sanctuary so that nothing untoward might happen there . Was it for the children ? Yes and no . For the idea that life might be scooped up and made dense with the pressure of a festival , a festival she now saw only as oppressive and absurd ? She felt ridiculous to have looked forward to it , to have imagined it was a time when life could be held back . She saw the weeks ahead , the meals , the presents , the parties , the clothes , as a sheet of black glass before her eyes , blank and cold , impossible to break through or to get around . Michael went on talking to Helene ; the children were cutting cookies . Perhaps she had invented everything ; the hooks under her skin might have been of her own construction . Surely if Helene thought Michael was having an affair , she would n't have hinted it in the kitchen . Anne watched her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acrylic sweater in its inorganic shade of red . Was it possible that this person , so universally acknowledged to be good , was making mischief ? Or was she , as Michael said , a genuine innocent simply passing on the great regard , the seasonal good wishes of a new , devoted friend ? Anne felt entirely alone in the room , and then it came to her that she was not ; she was being watched . Laura was standing at the counter , absently tearing lettuce into a wooden bowl . Laura 's eyes were on her . She , too , had seen the thing , the sharp , solid thing , rise up in the air , she had seen it fly apart , she had seen that the hooks had penetrated . From sheer irritation , Anne knocked the vinegar cruet to the floor ; the red liquid spread out quickly past the hillock of glass shards . In a second , Laura was beside her with a sponge , kneeling next to her , helping her , smiling with forgiveness , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wanted to shout at Laura as if she were a voyeur at the window . She wanted to scream : You have no right ; this is not your place ; this is my life . Your understanding of it , what you think of as your understanding , is a theft , a lie , you will never know anything about me . But that was out of the question ; it was something she would never do or say . She thanked Laura and , feeling she had to protect Michael from something , walked over to hint and put her arm around his waist . Driving to her parents ' house on Christmas Day , she thought of how she liked it now as she never had when it had been her home . Perhaps that was true for everyone , she thought . A necessary discomfort was engen-  | dered by those houses , which , like good and liberal parents , understood that at a certain point the children must heap scorn upon them . Having sheltered those young lives , having circled around them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those houses close in purposely upon the young so that they could do , joyfully , that incomprehensible thing : leave home and run to the outside world , as if that were the place where they were safe ? They stopped at a diner for lunch . In the window she noticed a sign : CHRISTMAS SPECIAL : TURKEY DINNER $4.95 . She knew Laura might easily have been one of the people in a place like that at Christmas . So it was a good thing that Laura was with them . It was one of the ways you made up for good luck , paid back the unpayable debt , by being kind to the unlucky . Nevertheless Anne resented her presence . She had been a witness to Anne 's suspicions about Michael , and as long as she saw Laura , Anne could n't bury her thoughts about her husband . She knew that her position was ridiculous whether Michael had a lover or not . If he did n't , she was the suspicious wife . If he did , she was still ridiculous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or comedy . She remembered her mother 's ideas about male sex . You must never , her mother had told her , allow them to take even the first step , because once they are aroused , they ca n't control themselves . It could n't be true , and yet the wisdom of the ages gave support to it . But Michael was no more libidinous than she ; they matched desire for desire . Sometimes she took the lead , sometimes he . But had she taken a lover , people would n't have said of her , " What could you expect ? " It would n't have been imagined that sexual deprivation was a physical problem that she had to tend to , like an ingrown toenail . People would have judged her  --  harshly , kindly , depending upon their approval of her lover and their affection for her and for Michael . With women , sex was never judged as a merely physical event . Perhaps the error lay not in what people thought about women , but in what they thought about men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex , or at least no affair that was simply physical . People needed all sorts of things from one another , and sex was , in some ways , the most straightforward way of getting them . Michael , for example , must have been missing home ; his easiest entree into someone 's domestic life would have been through a love affair . Charlotte Misticre : a great hostess , aged forty . Of course she could understand the appeal of it  --  a Frenchwoman , only just older than Michael , with her potpourris iii Sevres dishes and the perfect lunches she would have dreamed lip in Tier seventeenth-ccuturv  | bath  --  how could he resist it ? After all , they 'd both known it was partly what he went into French for : that fantasy of a people who knew how to live a daily life with elegance and warmth . It was perfectly easy to understand , when you thought about it ; it need n't seem so terrible . But thought had nothing to do with the stab she felt at the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crude stone weapon had been driven through her . It was easy to understand his reasons for doing it ; she had some of the same reasons herself . She understood how desire made things seem possible . She , too , felt desire . Only , she was faithful . But possibly he was too . Her feelings about Helene might have pushed her over some self-invented precipice . But at the center of her body was the wound . Whatever the nature of the weapon , whoever 's the hand that drove it , it had been driven through . She had been violated . Even if she had done it to herself , it had been done . Surely Michael must know something had happened . Knowing her so well , how could he not have seen she was distressed , that she had moved away from him . Perhaps that was the greatest sorrow to her : he had n't noticed , or if he had , he 'd turned his back . But she had said to him , " Do n't tell me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents came out to greet the car . It saddened Anne to see the children so polite with their grandparents , so held back . She felt the children 's shyness as her own reproach : she should bring them here more often . They were only three hours away . But she had always felt that her parents did n't take particularly to being grandparents . They were n't very good at it , not exciting and indulgent as Ben was , or Jane . She wondered if they had liked being parents . It occurred to her that one could n't simply say someone was a good parent : one had to be a good parent to someone . So her father had been a wonderful father to her , but with Beth he had always bungled . And her mother did far better with Beth than with her . What would Sarah and Peter think as they grew older ? She did n't see her failures as they would .

" " If they do n't get here soon , we 're not going to put anything in our Ixxlics , " said Anne 's father . " I low long does it take to cook a turkey ? "  | " It 's not a very big one . And a fresh-killed bird is much faster than a frozen one . " " You 're hedging , Susan , " said Les Elliott . " Well , Les , it should n't take more than five hours or so . We 'll have a nice late dinner . It will be European . " " We 'd be glad to help with anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lettuce . " The way he said " our mother " to her own mother made Anne sad . " Well , why do n't you children help your grandmother , and I 'll take this opportunity to invite my elder daughter on a walk . Michael , you can catch up with the last ten issues of the New Republic . " " That 's terrific restraint , Les , " said Anne 's mother sharply . " You actually let Anne be in the house for five minutes before taking her away . " Anne was glad that Beth was n't there . She could take pleasure in her father 's pleasure in her without worrying about what it was doing to her sister . " What would you like to do , dear ? " Anne 's mother said to Laura . " I have needlepoint to do , " said Laura , smiling . " Well , then , " said Anne 's father , " we 're all squared away .

It was her father who had taught Anne to garden . She remembered with poignant pleasure the look of his large hands covered with earth , the wet knees of his gardening pants after he weeded . He opened the greenhouse door , and she gave herself over to the sourish , humid air . It was a place , she thought , where no moral act was possible : one could be neither good nor bad in a greenhouse . She did n't have to worry about being fair to Michael , kind to Laura . She was simply happy in the warm air with her father , touching soil and leaves , following as he praised and muttered and despaired . " You must bring Beth and Richard when they come . They 'll be impressed with the solar operation , " she said . " Yes , but they 'll want to talk about it , and they 'll know so much about it and tell me everything that I 've done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a failure within ten minutes . Come , my dear , let me show you to my irises . It was a joke they 'd had for years , the stock-in-trade of their mock courtship .

" Beautiful , Daddy . You must be so proud of what you 've done . " " Are you all right ? You and Michael ? " " Fine , " she said . More than anything , she wanted to put her head on her father 's spongy shoulder to say , " I 'm afraid my husband 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then to have him stalk into the house and accuse her husband in a flourish of paternal eloquence . But he must never know ; he was the last person she could talk to . Long ago , she had stopped telling him when she hurt herself .

As it was , his and Michael 's relationship was distant , amicable : two tall men who respected each other as men of principle and hard work . But it was a frail alliance . She sat looking at her father , wanting his protection , protecting him  --  from the truth of her own nature or of the events , she could n't quite be sure which . " We 're fine , " she said .

It would be wonderful if your mother and I could take credit for you . But it seems to me you 've always been your own invention . " " I wonder if Beth and Richard are here . You really must bring them out here , Daddy . " " Yes , I must , " he said . " I 'm doing better with her now , I think . " " You must n't favor me so in front of her . You must work at it .

She thought that probably he did n't like the idea of her living with another man  | When they walked into the living room , Peter , Sarah and their cousins Liam and Sam were sitting on the couch with their grandmother looking at pictures of their mothers as children . Sam and Liam were eleven and twelve ; they seemed enormously adult to Anne , compared to her two children . Beth was carrying her baby , Ariel , in a front pack sling . Anne could hear the baby sucking as she came close to her . She had always been afraid to touch Beth 's children too fondly , afraid that if they responded to her too warmly their mother would see evidence of a new generation of betrayals . " I believe someone was just about to say , Was n't Anne a beautiful child and was n't Beth sturdy-looking . ' " Anne was about to demur that it was Beth who was the lovely child when she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that was what had happened : her mother and sister had absorbed the bitterness they felt toward her , built it into a safe , durable structure that excluded her and made her foolish , while they sat inside , women of the world trading wisecracks .

" I was hoping you and Richard might take a look at the greenhouse with me . I 'd like your advice on the vegetables . " " Give it a rest , old man , " said Beth . " Just because I caught you with your hand in the cookie jar , you do n't have to do a ballet of liberal guilt .

" Anne asked . With tremendous seriousness , Sarah did the five ballet positions she had learned in school . IIcr little-girl belly stuck out in a most mnballerina-like way , but her arms were in perfect alignment . Everyone clapped for her , and Beth 's baby began crying  | " I do n't know what 's wrong with her today , " said Beth . " I guess she 's picking up on my uptightness .

" " It probably would , if you were n't the world 's expert , " Beth said . Beth was in therapy ; she was being counseled to be " up front in her aggressions . " She had told Anne that it was very important , " for my life " she had said , that Anne put up with her aggressiveness and not try to defend herself . For a couple of years she said to Anne , " That is n't much considering what I 've had to put up with from you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insult her publicly , she would be silent . But she found the process dispiriting and exhausting . She did n't believe it would ever end ; besides , there was nothing new in all of it , it had been years since she had said a word when Beth attacked her , and Beth had attacked her ever since she 'd learned to talk . " I had almost caught up with you , " said Beth . " Then you pulled this out of the hat . " " It was pulled out of the hat for me , " said Anne apologetically . " I almost impressed Daddy with the farm and our antinuclear activity . He almost thought I was a person with a mind . Almost . But now I 'm back at the bottom of the class . " " Beth , dear , if the planet survives , it will be because of the energy and responsibility of people like you and Richard , " Lester Elliott said , putting his hand on her shoulder . Anne felt tears start at the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . She could bear her mother 's nudging her out into the cold , but she could n't stand her father 's leaving her there while he made his way to the fire . In the middle of her parents ' living room she stood , a large ungainly child , friendless and wordless in the company . She knew that M ichael knew what she was feeling and would help her if she walked across the rornn to him . But she had forfeited her right to his help , or he had forfeited his right to give it to her . One or the other , depending upon whether he 'd in fact been unfaithful , or she 'd imagined it .  | It was late when they left ; they would n't be home till two in the morning .

There had been the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children on the floor with their presents . Michael had been kind and helpful , but there was something between them . That it might be of her own invention made it no less real . So now , with the children asleep in the back of the car , with speech impossible for a while , she allowed herself , out of sheer hunger , to feel some closeness to her husband . She was grateful for the way he had behaved to Beth . He had been silent when Beth accused him of taking money from a CIA-based operation . It was something Michael had researched scrupulously ; it was simply untrue . She saw the effort that it took him to look down at his plate , to say it was hard to figure out who the villains were , and then to have Beth reply , " Not if you have nothing to gain from the villains . " She was sorry that Laura had been left out of things , but Laura had n't done much to change the situation . The children spent very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to her but had quickly given up , and Anne 's own attempt to have Beth and Laura talk about handicrafts ? Beth wove  --  was a failure . Beth kept trying to make a point about the alienation of modern man from craft , from ordinary objects . She wanted Laura to agree with her on the superiority of natural dyes and the excellence of the craftsmanship of " so-called primitive peoples . " There was no entry possible into this conversation for Laura , and Beth lost interest in her when she realized that Laura was working on a design of Minnie Mouse for Sarah 's winter jacket . As they got closer to home , Anne began increasingly to dread the moment that would have to come . Laura had asked if she could see Anne alone for just a few minutes . Anne knew that some complaint must be forthcoming , whether it would be about wages or conditions she was unsure . Or perhaps Laura wanted Anne to confide in her ; that would be worst of all . But now she would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ? It was a simple , straightforward request : a few minutes alone . Anne and Michael carried the children , already in their pajamas , into bed , and Michael went to bed himself . Laura sat in the kitchen , waiting for Anne . " Hi , " she said , as Anne came into the room . " Is now a good time ? ' '  | Anne smiled nervously . " It 's fine . " Laura reached into the deep pocket of her dress . " I got you this present , and I wanted to give it to you while we were alone . " She handed Anne a small box wrapped in scarlet tissue paper tied with white wool twine . Anne opened the box . Inside it was an amethyst necklace , one large stone in a floral golden setting , hung on a delicate chain . She took it out of the box . The stone picked up the weak light of the kitchen and held it : lucid , chaste . It was beautiful . It was exactly the sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of the antique shops on Fayerweather Street . She would have looked at it lovingly ; she would have lingered on the street in front of it , then walked away , deciding she could n't buy it . A little cloud of self-pity would have descended on her , which she would have had to shrug off . She would have said to herself that it was an indulgence she did n't need , the children needed something , or the house . Still , she would have gone back , looking , every time she stopped for something on that street , until someone had bought it and it had disappeared forever . And she would have mourned . Anne felt the necklace warm and thicken on her palm . She did n't want it , she did n't want it because Laura had given it to her . She began to wonder if she could give it away : to her mother , perhaps , or Beth . But looking at the girl , she knew it was impossible . Laura was watching her like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give the smallest child , the slowest child , a test . " It 's beautiful , Laura , " said Anne , " but you must take it back . You should n't have spent so much money . " " I wanted to . I wanted to give you a present you 'd never forget . So you 'd think of me whenever you wore it , and remember . " Kissing Laura , thanking her , Anne felt the words close around her . The girl wanted remembrance , and Anne had hoped that after she left the house , Laura would be forgotten . She saw now that this would never happen . Laura would always be with her , reminding her forever of the failure of her heart . The jewel would be a witness : she would never be able to think that Laura had been impervious to the life of the house , that Laura had not understood her . Looking at the necklace in her hand , Anne knew that I , aura had broken into her life . And she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could welcome the voyeur 's face at the window , silent , seeing , intimately holding in his mind 's eye all that she would never give .  | She and Anne were just alike : she knew it now . Their families were just the same , their parents did n't love them . She was the only one who understood Anne . Other people thought they loved her , said they loved her , but they came to her for what she gave them . They came to tell her things or to be near her , thinking from her looks that she was always rested , always glad to see them . But Laura knew when Anne was tired , fearful , lonely , when she was angry and wanted to be by herself , when she wanted her children and did not want them . She knew what Anne 's husband did n't know : that she had moved away from him . That she had , while he was away , looked at another man as she had not looked at him . She had felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room above them , Anne and that man , the electrician , sitting so late in the kitchen , drinking tea . She could feel Anne 's body and the man 's desiring to be near each other . She had prayed above them that the two might not embrace . And they had not embraced . She knew that . She had prayed that the man would go away , and he had gone away . He would come back , but she would keep Anne from him . She must keep Anne from him or Anne would be lost . Swallowed up , desiring the body of another person . And she must keep Anne from the woman Jane . Or else she would be lost to the proud world . She had found , in Ecclesiastes , the words God sent her for her understanding : " And I found more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets , and whose hands are fetters ; he who pleases God escapes her , but the sinner is taken by her . " She would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie proud woman , would fall before her feet . She had prayed for guidance and ( sul opened to  | Ezekiel . " Her proud might shall come to an end ; and she shall be covered by a cloud . " So the woman would disappear and Anne would never see her . Anne would know , through the will of the Lord , that only Laura loved her . She would see that even her children did not love her . That Laura loved her with the pure love , stronger than the love of children , or the love of men 's desires , or the love of father , mother , or the proud love of the mind . She would see , and it would not be long , that only Laura loved her with the Spirit , before which all other love must be consumed and die . Now that she knew Anne loved her , now that she knew that they were just alike , she could start . Now she could teach her , give her messages and guidance , pull her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . The hour was upon them . Now she would touch Anne with the burning hand of love : the flesh of Anne would burn and open . And the Spirit would fill her , driving out the error of her life . Oh , she was ready now , Laura could see , to know that her life was an error , that she had put her treasure where the moth ate and the thieves stole . But no more . Laura would help Anne to leave behind all that she thought she loved . And then the children , too , would follow . She did not mean that Anne should not be with her children . " Suffer the little children to come unto me . " Jesus had said it . She , Laura , would help Anne with the children . Anne would care for them , and Laura would instruct them . There was no need to keep the children from their mother . Only they must learn in time , as Anne would learn , that that love , too , was false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . That only the love of the Spirit was abiding . That all other love was death . She imagined how their life would be . First Anne would leave her husband . Laura did not like Michael , the husband . For Christmas , he gave her two books : Fear and Trembling and Waiting for God . He tried to tell her about them . But she did n't care . Books would lead no one to the Spirit . In the Scripture she found all she needed . The rest led astray . He talked to her in the voice he used with Peter , the voice that rose and fell in false curves . She saw the shape of it , the shape that said , " See , there is nothing that you know . " She would pretend to read his books because that would please Anne . She would let Anne read books if she wanted to when they lived alone together . When she had left her husband . How had Anne been able to lie with him ? She must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the Spirit leave her . I lad covered herself over with white sleep . A cloak , a cloud . Then opened her eyes and saw the dangerous , heaving body . And heard him Irving out . Sleeping in the room beside them , Laura had  | heard his cry , the first night he was home , as he lay with his wife . She had not heard Anne cry out . Because it could not bring her pleasure . Pinned unmoving underneath . Often she thought of what their life would be like . Hers and Anne 's . They would go away from everyone they knew . They would live together in a small house by a lake . Anne would cook and clean the house and tend the garden . Laura would sew and read the Scripture . In the evenings , late , they would drink tea together . Laura would speak of the Spirit . Anne would brush Laura 's hair for her and kiss her thankfully for having given her her life . When the children went away , they would see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Holding her hand , Anne would let Laura lead her to the throne of God . She had feared the husband could raise up his hooves and crush her underneath . Could lift his wife onto his back and carry her away . But Laura knew now that his power was nothing compared to hers . Was not even as strong as the power of the other man . For he had had another woman , and Anne knew . But that was the hand of the Lord . And Anne would know soon that the love of men was the root of death . Because she had loved Anne , Laura had lain with Adrian . He had not wanted to at first . The Scripture said you should not lie with men . But had not the good woman Naomi counseled Ruth to lie upon the floor where Boaz slept so that the work of the Lord could come to pass ? So she had been wise and cunning , knowing that only if she knew the love of men could she keep Anne from it . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so she could be near Anne . But now she saw it was not necessary . Now she saw how easy it would be to show Anne no one loved her , that what she thought was love was like fresh grass that before her eyes would wither into nothing . Into dry stalks , into air . Although she had lain with men , Laura was still innocent . Her body had been there but not her spirit . She remembered nothing of it . She had closed her eyes and caused her spirit to depart . She had come to him again and again , and he had taken her into his bed out of pity . It was through pity she had got to him at first . She had said to him , " No one 's ever said that I was beautiful . Or even pretty . " It was so easy to make them do what you wanted . She pressed the button of his pity ; like a cheap top of the children 's , he had moved his hands , his arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of shyness , as he thought , but so he could not see her laughing . Ile made her touch him . " Sometimes I need a little help at first . " ' I'hcn she did n't know what they did . Only her body lay there , but her spirit traveled . Afterwards , her spirit entered  | her body , and she saw him lying next to her , worn out , trying to catch his breath . Love , they called it , what they did . She thought of that as they lay together , their flesh damp like dough left out . She began to laugh because that was what they could call love . He asked what she was laughing at . I 'm happy , she said . That was all he needed to hear . Then he could roll over and sleep . He lay on his back , his mouth open , snoring , making loud disgusting noises like the animal he was . She knew that it was Anne he wanted in his bed . She knew that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once he told her how lucky she was to be living in the house with Anne . He said it thinking she would think he meant she was lucky to have the job . But she knew he meant she was lucky to walk on the same ground , eat the same food , to see her first thing in the morning , to sleep as she slept , hearing , through the wall , Anne 's breath . " Was Anne ever your lover ? " She asked him that as he cooked an omelet for her . She had found , in the drawer where he kept string and tape , a picture of Anne with the children . They were sitting on her lap , smiling , nearly babies , clumsy on her knee . She sat holding her babies , and her face was golden , the face of light . Seeing the picture , Laura worried . How would she be able to convince Anne that her children , too , were grass that would wither ? " Anne Foster my lover ? " Adrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was crazy . " So she knew that it was Anne he thought of as he lay above her . " I would never take Anne for my lover , " he said . " Not just because of Michael , who is my friend , but because I 'd always be afraid that she 'd go to bed with me because she thought it was her fault that I desired her . That she 'd have to make it up to me . " " Do n't you think she likes sex ? " Laura asked him . She hated him so much that she could hardly speak . At the end of the world , the Lord would wither him with one blast . He was a creature drunk on lust , hardly above an animal . She could n't even try to help him . It was not to help him that she lay with him ; it was for Anne . " I 'm sure she 's very ardent when she 's with Michael . But she likes sex , she does n't need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , giggling . It was so easy to know what they wanted you to say . Ile knew nothing about Anne . Laura knew that Anne desired the man who drank tea with her every night , his gut sticking over his belt like a pig . And she knew that Anne knew that her husband h ; ul another woman . Christmas had revealed the truth to her . Anne with her family . Alone  | among the ones who claimed to love her . In the future , Laura knew , Anne would look back at that Christmas as the time when Laura gave her the necklace . She would hear Anne saying , " That was when I knew you were the one who loved me . Only you . " Poor Anne . Since she did not yet know the love of the Spirit , she was hurt by her parents showing her they did n't love her . That they loved only her sister . Laura could n't remember anymore what it felt like , the pain of thinking she was alone because her parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember , she was covered by the thin white sleep . The peace of the Spirit that came when it was needed . Nothing hurt her now . She felt no anger , no bitterness . Only love . The pure love of the Spirit , which shone like the sun . That was how she loved Anne . That was how Anne loved her . In the Spirit , there was no suffering . Now Anne must suffer . She must stand in her parents ' living room alone , knowing they did n't love her . Anne 's parents were exactly like Laura 's . Anne 's sister was exactly like Debbie . Laura had seen in one minute that Anne 's mother had never loved her . " It 's hard work , taking care of two children , " Anne 's mother had said to Laura . She was small like Laura 's mother , and like Laura , Anne stood above her mother in a way Laura could tell Anne 's mother hated . Laura 's mother had said to her , " Do n't hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " She knew Anne 's mother had said that to her . And it had hurt Anne as it had hurt Laura , before the Spirit kept her from all hurt . " I love taking care of the children . They 're wonderful . " She said that because she knew that was what Anne 's mother wanted her to say . " I suppose I never had the talent for it , " Anne 's mother said . " I would get very bored . Neither of my daughters takes after me in that . They 're both more domestic than I ever was . I guess every generation of daughters has to reinvent family life . " Laura did n't know what she meant . She smiled , because the mother wanted her to smile . " Anne was lucky to get you , " said the mother . " But then , Anne 's always been lucky . Not like poor Beth . " " Poor Beth " meant the mother loved Beth only . " What will you do when you 're finished with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked that , not knowing . I will never he finished . I will he with your daughter through eternity . " Something will turn np , " she said . " I adn-ire people of your generation who are n't burdened with anxieties  | about the future . Perhaps it 's your faith . Anne says you 're interested in religion . My daughter Beth is the religious one in our family . Some mix of Buddhism and Transcendentalism with a drop of pantheism , from what I understand . I do n't think Anne 's thought about it much , one way or the other . They were both brought up quite irreligiously . I went to convent school for twelve years and had all I could take . Perhaps that was rash . " Anne will abide in the Spirit . She will be taken up , consumed in a garment of shining flames . " I do n't know what she tells the children about God , " the mother said . " She tells them God is love , " said Laura , smiling . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give them any trouble later . " They are safe with me . Together we will all be carried up . I will lift up Anne and her children . You will never hurt them ; you will never touch them . Stay with your other daughter , whom you love . The sister said , " I suppose my sister 's quite the taskmaster with her Mrs. Dalloway fantasy that you have to bring to life . Only , now she thinks she 's Mrs. Dalloway and Virginia Woolf rolled into one . Very handy , with you to pick up the pieces . " Laura did n't know what they meant , what the words said . Except the words were saying , " I have always hated my sister . " I will save you from this hate , she said to Anne in her heart . I will lead you to the Spirit , where there is no hate or sorrow . And the father did not love her either . Did not say to the sister , the mother , " Do not hurt my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while they made a fool of him . Took the other daughter 's side , said it was she who was important . Said to Anne ( the murmur underneath the words ) , " I will always desert you . I will always leave you alone . " I will save you , Anne . Only in the Lord is safety , Laura was saying in her heart as Anne stood in the center of her parents ' living room alone . When her father said , " If this planet survives , it 's because of the energy and responsibility of people like you . " Meaning , I do not love Anne , my daughter . See , I leave her alone in the center of the room . See , I cause her tears to flow . Should she fall to the floor from the weight of her sorrow I would do nothing for her . Should they all surround her , trying with their hands to kill her , I would stand and watch them . Anne could hear her father saying that , Laura knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why could n't she hear the words of I aura 's heart to her heart : I , only I , can lead you into safety . She could not hear those words that day because her husband was there , her children .  | Because she looked out at the white sun in the clouds . The white sun in the clouds was not her safety . Or the strength of her husband 's arms . Or the sweetness of her children 's bodies . That was the error that Anne lived by that the Lord would teach her in the proper time . The day was coming when Anne would know herself alone , unsheltered , and would turn to Laura , who would lead her to the Lord .  | Sarah 's Christmas dance recital had been canceled because of snow ; it was rescheduled for January sixth . The cancellation had caused in her that dark , late-morning storm of despair that children ca n't know is merely disappointment . Early on in motherhood , Anne had learned the truth of children 's moods : postponement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future stretched ahead like death . Empiricists to the bone , faith was to them unimaginable . What was not present was n't possible . On that day three weeks before , Anne had watched her daughter suffer , knowing the suffering would lift , but that while it hovered , there was nothing she could do . She offered her diversions , feeling even as she did that she insulted Sarah 's grief . Sarah sat at the kitchen table crying . Peter , who could n't bear to see her unhappy even when he had worked to make her so , kept popping in and out of the room with toys , books , card tricks , jokes . His desperation only burdened Sarah further ; she had her own unhappiness to deal with , she could not bear his sense of failure . Wearily , she put her head in her mother 's lap , a shipwrecked survivor holding for a moment to a soggy plank . Anne felt her breathe deeply . " Oh , well , " she said , " at least Daddy will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed , and Anne had forgotten about the recital until January second , when she met one of the other mothers at a party . Sarah was in a dance class called pre-ballet , for girls aged five to seven . She had wanted to join it because her best friend , Margaret , was in it . Ambivalently , Anne had agreed . The ballet school daunted her . It was run by a woman , ' Perri Blake , who at forty-five had a better figure than anyone Anne knew at seventeen . She walked around her studio in leotards . To  | receive checks she put around her a silk wrap skirt . She wore her hair pulled tight on the top of her head so that her eyes , ringed heavily with liner , looked a bit Chinese . A whole cadre of mothers paid her homage with a sycophantic devotion born of their sense of the inadequacy of their own slow bodies . Gratefully , these women sewed costumes , painted posters , passed out leaflets , printed tickets , raised money through bake sales and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the fate of their mothers ' lives . Anne was glad that she had the excuse of her work not to participate , even though it was well known that the best parts were given to the daughters of mothers who " cooperated . " Anne could see that Terri did n't like to teach younger children , but pre-ballet was her most profitable class . She had had ambitions as a ballet dancer . She had had a short and vaguely unsuccessful career in New York . She drove her talented older students mercilessly , determined that some of them would make it into a company . How could she enjoy the clumsy , boneless bodies of the five-year-olds , their simple portrayals of angels and snowflakes , when what she wanted was to put her older dancers through her adaptations of Jerome Robbins ' later works ? Still , she worked hard with the little girls on " Angels and Snowflakes " to " Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy . " And the children adored her , for some reason Anne could n't understand . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her children would be drawn to . Anne loved children 's performances if her children were n't performing , but when Peter or Sarah was involved , she was in agony . As the curtain went up on Sarah 's number and she heard the first notes of " The Sugar Plum Fairy , " she gripped Michael 's hand in terror . Event ' time she touched him now , she wondered if the other woman touched him in that way . He smiled at her , patting her other hand . " Sarah will be fine , " he said . " Do n't worry . Six little girls dressed as snowflakes knelt in the middle of the stage , their noses to their knees . They were supposed to be sleeping . The angels came onstage . Sarah was the smallest of them , and the last . Her wings were much too big for her , and she looked not magical but comic . Her body was implacably earthbound ; her halo sat on her head like a helmet . When she came to the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wand , sprinkling her with spangles , she tripped and fell . Overbalanced by her wings , she could n't get up . Everyone onstage giggled , and the audience began to laugh . The little girls froze into their positions as the music ticked away . Suddenly Terri Blake lunged onto the stage and picked Sarah up roughly by the ann . ' Flue audience applauded . The music had stopped , but  | the dance was only half over . Taking her bow , Sarah was shaking with sobs . The great applause only made her cry more . Let the theater blow up , let us all be buried alive in tons of rubble , Anne prayed , crying in her seat . The audience went on laughing and clapping . Sarah could n't get hold of herself . The more she sobbed , the more the audience clapped . Finally , the curtain was pulled roughly down . Anne got up to go backstage . " Stay here a minute , " Michael said . " Do n't let Sarah see you crying . I 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his seat and disappeared into the darkness . On the stage was a young boy in a skeleton costume dancing to Saint-Saens . Anne could n't stop crying . She was glad that Peter , who had come later than they , was sitting with the Greenspans . Her child had been exposed . People had laughed at her . It was Sarah 's first experience in humiliation , and Anne felt the sting in her own body . But she must go to Sarah ; it was Sarah who was important . She got out of her seat and walked backstage . Sarah was on her father 's lap ; he was wiping her eyes with his handkerchief . She had taken off her wings but not her halo . Michael smoothed her hair . They were both silent . Sarah still cried , but the shame was gone . She had her head on her father 's shoulder and they sat on in silence . " Let 's go home , " said Michael . Anne put on Sarah 's coat . The three of them walked out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home from Shiloh . They were driving to Jane 's . The trees , covered with icicles , shone unnaturally in the brilliant sun . The snow , which had melted , then re-hardened , . glistened on the surface , the freezing air enlivened the plain slab of hard blue sky and even the most undistinguished shrub was interesting . Anne loved winter with its forced speed of the blood , since she saw herself as naturally indolent . At the center of her being she perceived a sleepiness , a torpor , a passivity , that in a climate always warm she knew would take her over , once and for all . She thought it was this passivity that had brought her to the decision to give up the hard thing she 'd been cherishing , suspicion of her husband and the isolation it had forced her into . Simply , she could n't bear it anymore . She felt , when she breathed in or walked too quickly , a sense of wounding . But had she inflicted the wound herself , or had it been inflicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she had decided , seeing Michael with Sarah on the day of the recital , was that it was better that way . If she asked him , something real
