More pro football in the fall <P> Since the United States Football League started play in 1983 , the high-rolling owners of its 18 teams have each bet a fortune on the proposition that fans would flock to professional football in the spring and summer , when the air is traditionally filled with pop-ups and homers rather than punts and passes . So far , the new boys of summer have drawn disappointing crowds , suffered tepid television ratings and piled up losses of $80 million in 1984 alone . Meeting in Chicago last week , the owners decided that the only way to play for keeps is to switch to a fall schedule in 1986 , even though that means going head to head with the dominant National Football League . Said Donald Trump , owner of the U.S.F.L. 's New Jersey Generals : " If God wanted football to be played in the spring , he would n't have created baseball . " <P> One big question , though , is how the U.S.F.L. games will fit into the fall television schedule . NBC and CBS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ABC airs another match-up on Monday night . In addition , the law bars the networks from carrying pro games on Friday nights or Saturdays during the high school and college football seasons . Even so , U.S.F.L. Commissioner Chet Simmons thinks that ABC or one of the other networks may be willing to show a fourth Sunday-afternoon contest . Moreover , Simmons says that ESPN , the cable-TV sports network that has agreed to pay $70 million during the next three years to broadcast U.S.F.L. football , could carry games on midweek nights . <P> But even the money from ESPN will not be enough to move the U.S.F.L. teams into the black . The New Jersey Generals lost $4 million this season , and the Los Angeles Express an estimated $15 million . Only the Tampa Bay Bandits came close to breaking even . <P> Much of the league 's red ink flows from lavish salaries to star players . The Express signed Quarterback Steve Young to a lifetime contract reputed to be worth $36 million . Young 's paychecks are already proving to be a strain on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company that arranges loans for construction projects . Oldenburg is in financial trouble , and his team is up for sale . <P> Other owners , however , can draw on vast wealth to keep the U.S.F.L. alive . The Generals ' Trump is a New York City real estate tycoon who built the $200 million Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue . Alfred Taubman , a Detroit real estate baron who owns the Michigan Panthers , is believed to be worth more than $500 million . <P> Not all the owners favored the move to fall . Taubman 's son Robert voted against it on behalf of his father , partly because the Panthers will have to compete with the N.F.L. 's Detroit Lions for playing dates in the Silverdome . Myles Tanenbaum , owner of the champion Philadelphia Stars , said that the shift will force his team to leave Philadelphia for Baltimore to avoid scheduling conflicts with the N.F.L. 's Philadelphia Eagles . <P> Some football experts think the ultimate goal of the U.S.F.L. owners is to merge with the N.F.L. , as the American Football League did in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating the N.F.L. than joining it . He envisions a championship game between the winners of the two leagues . His proposed name for the confrontation : the Galaxy Bowl .
