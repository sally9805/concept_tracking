The result is , in effect , a thinking elevator - a hybrid of programmable computer chips and high-technology sensors . Advanced versions will appear in new skyscrapers this year and next , and in many existing buildings the technologies are being grafted onto old cars and motors. // Elevator designers hope to save either passengers ' waiting time or , by carrying more people with less equipment , building owners ' money . Clever programming alone - apart from increases in elevator speed - can serve as many as 1 , 500 people an hour with elevators that formerly reached their limit at 1 , 000. // The smart elevator will sense not only how many people are riding but also how many are waiting at each floor . In buildings with just one or two elevators , the microprocessor has little to add , but where banks of multiple elevators handle heavy , complex traffic , the computer comes into its own . Using techniques borrowed from game theory , it makes rapid choices , sending cars to where they can do the most good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward will be learning ability , enabling elevators actually to anticipate riding patterns. // The idea is to stamp out the various bugbears of elevator traffic . There is the phantom pickup , for example - the door of car number two opens to greet a rider who is no longer there , having just boarded car number one . There is car-bunching - elevators all heading upward in packs around the 20th floor while impatient crowds wait at the lobby. // " In today ' s world an elevator system gets overloaded and overpopulated , and the elevators tend to bunch together " even when passengers are distributed more or evenly , said William S. Lewis of Jaros , Baum &; Bolles , a consulting engineering firm in New York . Any system with many imperfectly coordinated moving parts can fall into an undesireable pattern . To overcome that , the computer has overrule the tendency of every car to try to answer the nearest call. // In the past , when elevators were controlled by relays , simple electromagnetic switches , complex logic was impossible , and individual cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevators look at one another and adjust to changing circumstances. // " It can say , ' Skip these calls and run express to the lobby , even though someone is going to wait longer , ' " Mr. Lewis said . " That gets to be a very esoteric algorithm . " <> <> Elevator as Anthropologist // Over the past few years , some elevator riders have already had to adjust to the first signs of the new technologies , such as graphic color television displays of schematic elevators gliding up and down the screen . Some riders have had to suppress their annoyance at the sound of synthesized voices asking them to " Clear the door " or explaining dolefully , " There is no cause for alarm. " // Elevator systems have long been able to adjust somewhat to periods of peak up or down traffic , by automatically sending extra cars to the lobby in the morning , for example . With learning computers , a building ' s elevator system will act like a sort of anthropologist , studying rider habits until it can anticipate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This capability allows a system to adjust when it discovers that the law firm on the 14th floor begins to empty out early Friday afternoons during the summer , say , or to recognize cafeteria-bound traffic at lunch time. // " React is the key word here , " said Merton Meaker , director of technical marketing for United Technologies Otis Elevators . " The elevator control systems will recognize different traffic patterns in a building , day to day or week to week , and respond accordingly . " <> <> Bonuses and Penalties // Mathematical ingenuity is required for banks of cars to make the optimal decisions for moving people around large office buildings . Manufacturers have worked out programs that calculate different hypothetical futures and compare their desirability , just as a chess-playing computer does , using penalties and bonuses to help weigh the alternatives. // Bonuses can be awarded for assigning a call to a car that has a rider who wants to stop at that floor anyway -a seemingly obvious strategy that was beyond the capability of old-fashioned systems . Penalties are awarded for decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , penalties are awarded for keeping people waiting ; long waits get extra heavy penalties . The appropriate threshold is a matter of debate . Officials of Fujitec America , for example , cite a psychological study that found " great irritation " after 60 seconds or more. // That study was conducted in Osaka . " Thirty seconds is the rule of thumb in New York , " said James J. Mancuso , area manager for Fujitec . <> <> Recognizing a Mob // Fujitec hopes to begin installing within the next few months the first infrared sensing devices to detect the body heat of waiting riders , in office buildings at Battery Park City . Other companies , too , are preparing such devices - " people sensors " - to let their computers recognize a nascent mob before it is too late. // In some ways , that information is even more important than it would have been in the era when every elevator was on its own . The new computer strategies can outsmart themselves , programmers have discovered. // For example , suppose 20 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one car arrives . Eight people board . The remaining people press the button again . Without people sensors , the computer will start its waiting-time count all over again at zero , giving the floor a low priority. // Many systems already have the ability to estimate how many riders are in a car by weighing it , and that information , too , is being added to computer strategies . Cars that feel full can be instructed to stop trying to pick up new riders . And as an " antinuisance feature , " when a dozen buttons are pushed in a car that is suspiciously light , the computer can automatically turn them all off. // The first generation of operatorless , automatic elevators is now more than 30 years old , so modernization of old systems forms the largest share of the market . In a new building , however , the potential for saving money is vast . The central elevator space of a building represents a tremendous cost , and allowing 8 elevators to do the work of 12 can mean millions of dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its useful limit . Said Mr. Meaker of Otis : " There ' s a physiological restriction that ' s going to limit us to about 2 , 000 feet per minute : the comfort level on the human body when you change cabin pressure. " // In other words , ears start popping . " If you want to go faster your only alternative is to pressurize the cab , " Mr. Meaker said . <> <> Dealing With Randomness // Computer strategies must deal with tremendous variation and randomness in rider behavior . On average , some manufacturers estimate that an office worker will make six trips a day , but that can be much higher when a company extends over several floors. // In a building with 10 floors and 1 , 000 people , elevators might need to handle 250 rides an hour . In the World Trade Center , more than 200 elevators carry 40 , 000 people an hour. // The millions of seconds freed by the technologies will not necessarily be distributed democratically . " We do have what is known as executive service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , which has updated elevator systems in many existing buildings. // Certain New York City executives - they know who they are - can press a button at their desk , causing an elevator to speed toward their floor . Or an executive can dial a number from a car telephone to make sure an elevator will be standing by at garage level. // The microchip has made other special services available , as well . In the event of a terrorist attack , for example , an operator can instruct the computer to send all the elevators in a building to a particular floor and open the doors one by one , presumably delivering the occupants into the hands of the waiting security forces. // For now , human operators do control even the computerized systems . Consoles with elaborate color-coded graphic displays have been set up at lobby security desks or in special elevator control centers. // In some buildings , the designers have begun to note an unexpected , and possibly unsettling , phenomenon . The operators develop a tendency to involve themselves in their work. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play with the system , " said Mr. Mancuso of Fujitec . " They make it like a video game.
