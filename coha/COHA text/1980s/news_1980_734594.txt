txt OMEDAY , WHEN the Chicago firefighters ' strike of 1980 is jest a memory , she will think back . She will think of her father , and of what , she learned about him during the long and terrible days and nights . She is 21 now , with a husband of her own , but when she was a little girl she learned to be proud.of the fact that her dad was a fireman . To her it meant respect and integrity ; everyone admired a fireman , and everyone admired her dad . The family lived on the Northwest Side of Chicago ; her dad , her mom , the five kids . It 's funny ; she never used to worry about her father . Ile would be out on the most dangerous of calls , and she always trusted that he would come back safely . She knew his work was dangerous ; once his picture was on the front page of The Tribune for saving a little boy 's life , and that had made her realize what a hard job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't scared . She knew he would come through it all right . Now she is a grownup , though , and this time she was scared . Not because of the danger of the fires . But because her father happened to be one of the men who refused to strike . Out of a department of 4,500 men , only a few hundred stayed on to protect the city , and he was one of them . SHE HAD TALKED to him at the firehoUse , over the telephone . Ile sounded crazy ; the pickets outside had made noise all night , every night , so that the few inside could not sleep . They had kept chanting and rapping on the windows and banging the door . Her father had not slept in days . Every time he tried to , they would wake him tip . And at home ? where her mother still lives with the two youngest boys ? the prank calls kept coming in the middle of the night . " Do you know where your husband is right now ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Sometimes they would threaten to blow up the family 's car , or to harm the children : Her mother had moved the two boys into the main bedroom , where they all slept together in the name of safely . The daughter thought to herself : These are firemen who are doing this ? These are the men my father has worked with for all these years ? One of the strikeri had told her mother ? had said it to her face ? that when the strike was over , her father 's legs were going to be broken . When the daughter had heard this she had told her mother to call the police . But the mother had said that would do no good ; all of the nonstriking firemen 's families were going through it . The thing that was haunting the daughter , though ? the thing that was frightening her the most ? was what had happened when she had phoned her father at the firehouse . SHE HAD BEEN through some hard times With . him , over the years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so badly that he had gone temporarily blind , had had to have patches put on them . One of those times , when she was leading him into an eye clinic , she had said to the doctor : " Tell him not to do it anymore . Tell him that if he keeps this up he 's going to lose his eyes . " But her father had not cried . ? And just last year , her grandmother - i-  her father 's own mother '  - -  - . had died , and she had stood with him at the cemetery as he watched the casket being lowered into the ground . And he had not cried . But when she had called him at the firehouse , be had started to tell her what it was like . " This is the hardest thing I 've ever done in my life , " he had said to her . " I 've worked with these men , and eaten with them , and slept with them , and poured my heart out to them . " And then he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first time she had heard her father cry . " 1 DO N'T KNOW what I should do , " he said to her , his voice cracking . " They keep chanting my name , calling for me to come outside and join them on the picket lines . I 'm one of the only ones left . ' I 'm not being supported by anyone . This is mental warfare . The things the others are saying to ' ' me .... " He told her that all his life the had loved being a fireman ; had loved it because of what it meant , of helping people and doing a job that society needed to be done . He had thought that every fireman ielt that way . Now , though , there'were only a few in the station , and when they went out on a call , bone tired , the strikers would follow them . " They take my picture when I 'm at the fires , " be said through the tears . " Everything 's changing . Even when this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . This is my life , and now it 's ruined , now everything is going to change , but I ca n't walk away .... " SHE WANTED to tell him that everything would he all right , but she could n't , because they both knew it might not be true . She wanted to bring her mother to the firehouse so they could go in and hug him and comfort him , but he begged her not to . He said he could control himself when the striking firemen called him the obscene names , but he did not know what he would do if he heard them say it to his family . So she does n't know what to do . She is n't very good with words , but she wants him to know what . she is feeling . Which is this : She has never seen such courage In a man . She has always known that he was brave ; but this is different . This is something so special that only a few people in the world will ever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She loves him and she prays for him and she cries for him , and someday , when it is all over , she will tell him about it . She has never seen such courage in a man , and the man is her father . A fireman .
