Oil Spree <P> To the Editors : The fall in oil prices ECONOMY &; BUSINESS , April 14 is of great interest to those of us in the Northeast . Remember the bumper stickers saying LET THE BASTARDS FREEZE IN THE DARK ? While I sympathize with the unemployed in Texas , I find it difficult to feel sorry for the rich oil barons . Peter J. Scarafile Fairport , N. Y. <P> Revenge is sweet . I remember OPEC ministers and U.S. oilmen admonishing American consumers for our unrestrained consumption of oil . I remember , too , those avaricious souls telling the world that high oil prices were nothing more than the result of supply and demand . Now that the cycle has reversed itself , let OPEC and American oil producers suffer . Mike Huberty Knoxville <P> The attitude that all oil-patch workers live like TV 's J.R . Ewing and deserve this downfall is tiresome . We are the people who have been doing the hard , dangerous , dirty work of keeping rigs running . The rest of the country can enjoy low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying later in gas lines . Georgia McClure Woodward , Okla.Stemming Terrorism <P> It was refreshing to read the article on terrorism by Benjamin Netanyahu , Israel 's Ambassador to the U.N . SPECIAL SECTION , April 14 . Thank God people are beginning to realize that terrorists are not soldiers fighting for a cause , but cowards who kill for the sport of it . Yvonne S. Perry Baltimore <P> The displacement of the Palestinians and their continuing plight leaves very few options to an embittered Arab world . Unfortunately , terrorism is one of them . Perhaps fair treatment of the Palestinians might be the answer to ending this horror . William Bunce New Hope , Pa . <P> Instead of publishing Ambassador Netanyahu 's views , you should devote your columns to explaining how much Israel has contributed to so-called terrorism . The current level of violence is only the tip of the iceberg . Denying the Palestinian issue is leading to global disaster . Farooque Rizwy Brooklyn Park , Minn . <P> Why not put a large bounty on terrorists ? Perhaps $1 million on the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to shoot for . Terrorist leaders would have to look long and hard at their followers and would constantly need to watch their backs , possibly making the terrorists less effective . James Amato Los Altos , Calif . <P> Does anyone believe that removing the causes will eliminate terrorism ? What will it take ? The destruction of Israel ? The conversion of all Sunni Muslims to the Shi'ite faith ? The eradication of any Western influence on Islam ? The crowning of Gaddafi as Sultan of North Africa ? And will any of that satisfy the I.R.A. , the Baader-Meinhof or the Red Brigades ? Brian Eddolls New York CityChampionship Play <P> The story on Louisville as the No. 1 basketball team SPORT , April 14 deserves consideration for the Hall of Fame of sportswriting . Your report caught the essence of the team , as well as the emotions surrounding basketball in Kentucky . Richard L. Coe Benton , Ky.
