With mid new flavors available , U.S. popcorn sales explode <P> It used to be an oleaginous mulch that clogged the incisors at movie theaters . Today , like pasta , pizza and the humble potato , popcorn has gone gourmet . Or , at least , wild . Now , with a few of the dozens of new flavors available , it is possible to have an entire dinner composed of popcorn . After the cocktail hour ( pia colada flavor with sour-cream-and-onion popcorn for hors d'oeuvres ) , the finger-fed meal features New England-clam-chowder popcorn , barbecue popcorn for entrees , fruit salad composed of strawberry , grape and cantaloupe popcorn and , for dessert , chocolate-fudge popcorn . <P> In between meals , the U.S. is in the midst of a popcorn explosion . Since 1972 , consumption has soared from 372 million to 611 million lbs . a year , or about 42 qt. per person . From Florida and Texas , where jalapeno popcorn is hot , to the blizzard belt , where maple flavor warms the gullet , new retailers keep popping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . For instance , a dozen or more competitors have opened up around the two Garrett Pop Corn Shops in Chicago 's Loop ; even so , the 33-year-old Garrett 's , which sells only butter , caramel , cheese and plain , has seen business treble in the past decade . <P> Industry analysts attribute the corn craze to Americans ' heightened dietary sophistication . Like spuds and spaghetti , nutritionists point out , popcorn is low in calories before the butter goes on ; two cups of popcorn have fewer than a medium-size apple . The American Dental Association recommends sugar-free popcorn for snacking . The Illinois division of the American Cancer Society praises popcorn as one of the " eleven things that do n't cause cancer . " ( Among the others : a good laugh , exercise , fruit and vegetables . ) Says James Fowler of American Pop Corn Co. , Sioux City , Iowa : " If you had asked a lady a few years ago whether she ate popcorn , she 'd have told you , ' No , it 's too fattening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you it 's part of her diet . " <P> One dieter who became popcorn-addicted in 1980 was Actor Jack Klugman ( The Odd Couple , Quincy ) , who found in popcorn the answer to his craving for snacks . Klugman is spreading the good munch via Jack 's Corn Crib , a planned chain that has already opened two outlets in Manhattan and expects to have at least 100 franchised cornporiums in business by 1985 . Klugman uses no salt in his recipes and a maximum of 5% sugar . He has brisk competition in New York from Popcorn Paradise , which is adopting a movie-palace lobby decor on a moderate scale . <P> The biggest chain is called Corn Poppers , run by Charlie Bird , 54 , of Dallas , who has five stores and 35 franchised outlets operating and 35 more set to open this year . He produces 60 flavors but allows his stores to sell only 32 , the selection depending on location . Why 32 ? " There is usually a Baskin-Robbins around with 31 flavors of ice cream , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the block , you 've got to go the other fellow one better . " Klugman plans to get his soft corn into the theaters . As the saying goes , without popcorn there would not be any movies .
