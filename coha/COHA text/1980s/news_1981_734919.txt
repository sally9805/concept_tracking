' the whole game , " saidArnohL " We were embarrassed at half . We were n't ready I 'm their box and one ( zone with Paxson on Ainge ) .

And they 'll continue to make them because they have quality players . " " WE WERE STRUGGLING at the end of the first half and start of the second , " said Cavalier Coach Terry Holland . " Then we went to the man-to-man defense and we played more aggressively at both ends of the floor . We put more pressure on the ball . " It 's something when Sampson makes only 4 of 13 shots .
