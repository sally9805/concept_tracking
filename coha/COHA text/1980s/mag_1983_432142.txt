 | The hottest item at I. Magnin 's department store in San Francisco this year is a $40 Japanese robot watch that shoots out miniature arms and legs when removed from its owner 's wrist . In New York , meanwhile , fashionable shoppers are embracing what might be described as the Republican mistress look . Anything having to do with evening wear ? anything with beads and sequins ? is " selling like crazy , " reports Saks Fifth Avenue vice president Ellin Saltzman . Consumers in Boston are snapping up Ralph Lauren 's linen shower curtains for $100 to $200 a shot ? and people all across America are frantically snatching teddy bears off the shelves . " Bears are the theme this year , " insists retail analyst Bruce Grier of Drexel Burnham Lambert . If so , they seem curiously out of place amidst the most bullish Christmas sales season in recent memory . " The truth is that just about everything is selling , and everywhere we look people are buying , " says Keith Powell , president of The Federated Group , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekends before Thanksgiving . " I have n't seen this kind of fever since 1973-74 . " Economists are predicting that retail sales may rise by as much as 15 percent during this year 's final quarter , and retailing profits are expected to rise by even more . Consumers are suddenly feeling good about themselves and the national economy , argues Malcolm Sherman , president of the 275-store Zayre chain . " There is an attitude of optimism that says , We 're going to have our jobs next year , general business conditions are pretty good and we have n't really indulged ourselves in a long time ' . " New Wealth : For now , at least , the new mood of optimism seems entirely justified . Aided by a $29 billion tax cut in July , inflation-adjusted disposable incomes rose a the impressive annual rate of 6.7 percent in the third quarter ? and much of that windfall remains unspent . In addition , the Commerce Department reported last week that pretax personal income rose by 1.2 percent in October ? the largest such rise in more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy has created about 2.5 million new jobs since the beginning of the year . And many Americans are unexpectedly wealthy . Thanks to the bull market on Wall Street , the value of their financial holdings has risen by more than $500 billion since August 1982 . A portion of that new wealth will undoubtedly be spent for Christmas , as will gains from the sale of housing . Economist Alan Greenspan estimates that home sales will generate $90 billion of capital gains this year , double the level of 1982 . While most of that money will be reinvested in new housing , a significant portion will be used to support general consumption . " If there are any clouds out there on the horizon , " says Greenspan , " they are too far away and too small for me to see . " The new well-being of the American consumer will be felt most strongly in industries such as cars , furniture , appliances , clothing and leisure goods ( chart ) ? items that are relatively easy to defer when incomes are rising more slowly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling well , " says Saltzman of Saks . Or frivolous . Among the best-selling items in this year 's Saks catalog are S12 pantyhose that come complete with a sewn-in rhinestone ankle bracelet and a handsome $10 box of " Dogiva " biscuits for dogs . Consumers are clearly more impulsive than in the past . Last year , says analyst Robert Simonson of Kidder , Peabody &; Co. , " they bought what they needed and put a bow on it . " But this Chris- - mas , he adds , a man buying a dress for h : - wife will also throw in a pocketbook or a expensive scarf . " These add-ons mean go ( , profit margins , " Simonson insists . Slowed Spending : Many experts belie% that the holiday sales boom is coming at tlperfect time to sustain the recovery . " Evethough business has been building inventories , sales have been rising even faster . ' says Jerry Jasinowski , chief economist ft - the National Association of ManufacturerAs a result , factories will continue t be flooded with new orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers will be called back int , service , and their paychecks will help t , keep the spending spree alive . " A stron selling season will give a powerful lift to the economy , " concludes Irwin Kellner , chiec economist for Manufacturers Hano%eTrust Co . " For every dollar the consumer spends at Christmas , it will add another $2 to the gross national product in 1984 . " Eventually , though , consumer spending will begin to moderate : the personal tax @#  | cuts will have been spent and the growth of employment will slow . But when that happens ? probably sometime next spring ? business will be fully prepared to move into the second phase of a classic economic expansion , capital spending . Last week , for example , the National Association of Business Economists ( NABE ) announced the results of a November survey that showed that industry plans to increase its real spending for plant and equipment by 9 percent next year . That was nearly double the increase forecast as recently as last August , and according to NABE president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to correct , " there 's just no real chance that the recovery will falter " next year . Filippello insists that business will be undeterred by the impact of high interest rates or larger-than-life federal deficits . Productivity in manufacturing is currently growing at the rate of 12.1 percent a year , and while that rate of improvement is clearly unsustainable , a continuing trend to- ward greater efficiency and relatively low wage settlements will powerfully boost pretax profits . And simultaneously , says Filippello , " the benefits of the 1981 corporate tax cuts are really kicking in . " As a result , corporations will be able to fund their ambitious capital spending programs with internally generated funds , easing the pressures on the financial markets . The federal deficit may indeed become a problem , Filippello admits , but not until 1985 at the earliest . Shortages : Meanwhile , the Federal Reserve Board plans to do its part to insure that the recovery endures . " One ca n't think of trying to halt the expansion with tighter money , " says a Fed governor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiscal ) stimulus , but those are worries for 1985 , " For now , at least , the Fed sees few overt signs that inflation may be rising , and industrial capacity remains sufficiently slack so that there is little danger of productive bottlenecks . And for once , even Treasury Secretary Donald Regan seems to agree with the Fed . " I wish economists would sit back and relax , " he complains . " We 've got one of the fastest , strongest recoveries in our history , and that 's something to enjoy ? not worry and fret about . " The only thing consumers are fretting @# 1IIIIII111111$  | about is shortages . Unlike last year , when consumers waited for December clearance sales , brisk pre-Christmas selling has created shortages among the most popular toy items ( page 109 ) , while home computers are becoming a major headache . " The Commodore production is all spoken for , " says leisure-time analyst Mark Manson of Donaldson , Lufkin &; Jenrette . Coleco will ship only 150,000 to 200,000 units before Christmas , while Atari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last week , however , consumers were still able to indulge their taste for hand-woven sweaters and Italian silk ties and decorate : Heir trees with ornaments of silver and Baccarat crystal . At just $375.50 an ounce , gold was a bargain , and sales of diamonds were doing exceptionally well . There was an air of holiday nostalgia as shoppers were jostled , parking spaces disappeared and the salesclerks were as surly as ever . In short , Americans were looking forward to an oldfashioned commercial Christmas just like the ones they used to know .
