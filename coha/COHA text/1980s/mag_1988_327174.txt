What is the most influential drama in American literary history ? As plausible a candidate as any is The Glass Menagerie . Since Tennessee Williams brought his family confessional to Broadway in 1945 , virtually every U.S. dramatist of substance has revealed himself in a guilt-ridden memory play , from Arthur Miller 's Death of a Salesman and Eugene O'Neill 's long-concealed Long Day 's Journey into Night to Lanford Wilson 's Lemon Sky and Neil Simon 's Broadway Bound . Into those ranks comes Michael Weller . Heretofore best known for Moonchildren and the screenplay of Hair , both valedictories to the ' 60s , Weller looks back to his adolescence , a decade earlier , in Spoils of War . His story of estranged parents and a teenage son who schemes to reunite them is a harrowing addition to the genre and the only work of lasting value to debut on Broadway this season . <P> The stand-in for Weller is Martin ( Christopher Collet ) , a gawky and irritable but predictably literate youth whose clumsy idealism embraces everything from ending the cold war to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonrecognition between his mother and father . The parents are former leftist activists who once lived for " the movement " and each other , and now find only regret in recalling either ardor . The father ( Jeffrey DeMunn ) is genial enough  --  a mildly successful photographer who deflects his son 's attempts to romanticize him  --  although his affability fades into meanspirited vehemence at the least challenge to macho authority . The exceptional person in this triangle , and the reason Weller 's play can arouse memories just as vivid for onlookers as for him , is the mother Elise , played by Kate Nelligan . <P> Seductive yet deserted , maternal yet undependable , witty and gay in the midst of poverty and squalor , supremely self-confident and supremely self- destructive , Elise might easily seem nothing more than that old literary standby the bundle of paradoxes . As played by Nelligan , the character comes exuberantly alive . Vitality and beauty are common enough in star turns ; so is warmth , although Nelligan , whose technical gifts are extraordinary , has never before shown it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once on film , in her 1985 performance as a heroic Greek mother in Eleni . <P> Her remarkable feat is to make audiences believe at once in this woman 's intelligence and her ultimate helplessness , so that they view her as her son does : with affection and even admiration despite her frustrating fecklessness , her fumbling of life 's every chance . From the first scene , when she serves a dinner of warm milk ( hers liberally laced from a pocketbook flask ) in an apartment without electricity , to the climactic reunion , when she arrives unkempt in a bedraggled housecoat and proceeds to exude glamour and sophistication from every pore , she makes life an adventure . Unlike the mother in The Glass Menagerie , whose tale of having 17 gentlemen callers seems a sad fib , Elise is convincing when she says , " I used to make quite the impression when I entered a room . I stood perfectly still , and everything moved in my direction . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
