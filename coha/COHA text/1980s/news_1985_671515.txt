In its decision last January , the court ruled that all life-prolonging medical treatment , including feeding tubes , could be withheld or withdrawn from a terminally ill nursing home patient , provided that was what the patient wanted. // The decision affirmed what the court said was the constitutional right of adults to refuse medical treatment , even at the risk of death . It extended that right to include incompetent nursing home patients who were no longer capable of expressing that refusal , so long as there was " trustworthy " evidence that this was what they would choose if they could. // The decision gave the State Ombudsman for the Institutionalized Elderly the authority to approve requests for the removal of feeding tubes in cases that met the court ' s requirements . Thus , the ombudsman , Jack R. D ' Ambrosia , is believed to be the first person in New Jersey - other than a juror , judge or governor in capital cases - to be given such life and death power. // Legal efforts are under way to apply the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove a feeding tube from Hilda M. Peter , an incompetent patient who lies comatose in a nursing home here. // Eberhard H. Johanning , the man with whom Miss Peter lived and who has medical power of attorney over her , said she repeatedly stated before her heart attack a year ago that she never wanted to be kept alive " like a vegetable " and preferred " death with some kind of dignity . " <> <> ' Never Wanted This ' // " She never wanted this ; she pleaded with me never to let it happen , " Mr. Johanning said in an interview . Toward that end , he said , he and Miss Peter exchanged powers of attorney in 1983 so that one could have " full and complete authority to manage and direct " the other ' s medical care in the event of incompetency and hopeless illness. // If Mr. Johanning ' s efforts succeed in legal proceedings that are scheduled to begin next month in State Superior Court in Newark , the feeding tube that is keeping Miss Peter alive would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey to die under the procedures sanctioned by the court. // The State Supreme Court ruling in a case involving Clare Conroy , a nursing home patient , is regarded as a landmark by right-to-die advocates because it did not draw any distinction between a feeding tube and a respirator in decisions involving the withdrawal of life-sustaining care . While removing a patient from a respirator may or may not cause death , the withholding of a feeding tube most certainly would , within a week or so. // Courts in other states that have grappled with right-to-die issues have issued varying decisions . For example , a ruling by a probate judge in Massachusetts last Tuesday denied a family ' s request to withdraw a feeding tube from Paul E. Brophy , a comatose 48-year-old firefighter who has suffered severe brain damage and has no hope for recovery . The judge said it would be " ethically inappropriate to cause the preventable death of Brophy by the deliberate denial of food and water. " // A New Jersey appeals court ruled the same way in 1983 when it said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and constituted " murder. " // But in overruling the New Jersey appeals court this year , the state ' s highest court disagreed . " For patients who are unable to sense hunger and thirst , " it said , " withholding of feeding devices such as nasogastric tubes may not result in more pain than the termination of any other medical treatment . " <> <> Earlier Ruling Extended // The decision in the Conroy case , in which the patient had already died of natural causes by the time the ruling was issued , extended the court ' s original right-to-die ruling in the case of Karen Ann Quinlan , who died this year in a nursing home . Miss Quinlan ' s death came a decade after the same court allowed her parents to remove her from a respirator. // The Conroy decision authorized the state ombudsman to accept applications for the denial or removal of life-sustaining treatment and then to investigate to determine if the requirements established by the court were met. // The requirements apply only to incompetent and elderly nursing home patients who suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given no more than a year to live . The court said such patients were the most vulnerable because they were so old and ill , isolated and disabled , and often without anyone to speak for them. // The ruling requires the ombudsman to determine if the patient had ever stated that he or she would have forgone artificial life support , or whether the burden , pain and indignity of a patient ' s In Miss Peter ' s case , if the ombudsman finds she falls within the court ' s requirements , he can concur with the request made by Mr. Johanning and authorize that the feeding tube be removed . " It ' s a tremendous responsibilty , " said the ombudsman , Mr. D ' Ambrosia , a 32-year-old lawyer appointed by Governor Kean , said in an interview . " It ' s one that didn ' t hit me fully until I received the first application in behalf of Miss Peter. " // Mr. Johanning , who lived with Miss Peter for more than three years before she suffered a heart attack a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Hartwyck Nursing and Convalescent Home here and railed against the medical bureaucracy that he said was keeping her alive against her will . <> <> Worked in Hospital // " Hilda and I loved each other , " Mr. Johanning said . " But if she could rise up from this bed , she would want to kill me for allowing this to happen to her. " // " Hilda worked in a hospital for 10 years and she nursed her stepfather and her mother through their deaths , " he said . " And the one thing she said to me over and over again was this : ' Joe , don ' t ever let that happen to me . Don ' t do anything heroic , I don ' t want to live as a vegetable. ' " // But Miss Peter , her eyes unfocused , her breathing labored and her legs tucked in a fetal position , could not hear him. // Mr. Johanning ' s efforts to allow Miss Peter to die began shortly after she suffered a heart attack on Oct. 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Verona. // His efforts will be legally joined on Nov. 4 before Judge Harry A. Margolis in State Superior Court in Newark. // At that time , Mr. D ' Ambrosia , after conducting his own investigation and obtaining the testimony of the nursing home and two independent physicians on the extent and irreversibility of Miss Peter ' s comatose condition , is scheduled to report to the Superior Court whether the State Supreme Court decision applies to her in whole or in part . <> <> Ruling on Authority // On Nov. 14 , Judge Margolis is expected to rule on Mr. Johanning ' s application to be designated Miss Peter ' s guardian , giving him the legal authority that is required by the court before he can officially request that the feeding tube be withdrawn from Miss Peter . Mr. Johanning also will have to present evidence that Miss Peter had previously stated that she did not want to be kept alive artificially. // According to the State Supreme Court ruling , any final decision to withdraw the feeding tube only requires the concurrence of Mr. D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D ' Ambrosia ' s first case and because there is some question whether her condition meets all of the requirements stipulated by the court , officials involved in her case expect that further legal action will be required by Judge Margolis. // For example , one of the the court ' s requirements was that a patient have no more than one year to live . Although Miss Peter was only given a week or so to live last year , her vital signs now remain relatively stable and there are differing medical opinions on how long she will survive. // In addition , officials expect legal challenges from right-to-life groups . <> <> Lawyer Appointed // In the interim , Judge Margolis has appointed Jerome M. Lynes , a Newark lawyer , to represent Miss Peter to insure that her interests are protected. // Miss Peter , who had a history of heart disease , came to the United States from East Germany in 1952 and lived with her mother and stepfather in Newark . Her husband had been killed in World War II. // Friends described her as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met Mr. Johanning , a carpenter , on a cruise ship in 1975 , three years after her mother died . She moved into his home in 1981 after she retired as a ward clerk at Irvington General Hospital. // In 1983 , Mr. Johanning and Miss Peter went to see Nicholas E. Caprio , a lawyer in West Orange . Because they were not married , they feared that if one of them became hopelessly ill and incompetent , the other would be powerless to assure " a dignified death . " It was then that they signed mutual powers of attorney . <> <> Only Living Relative // Miss Peter ' s only living relative , Werner Boettcher of Union , who is a first cousin , has filed an affidavit in support of Mr. Johanning ' s efforts to be named her guardian and remove the feeding tube. // On Oct. 15 last year , as Miss Peter was cooking dinner , she suffered a massive heart attack . She was rushed to Mountainside Hospital in Montclair and placed on life support in the intensive-care unit. // Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be made to sustain her life . Louis A. Racioppe , a senior vice president of the hospital , said last week that Miss Peter did not have a " family " and thus there was no one to consult. // Miss Peter suffered severe brain damage and she has never regained consciousness . Dr. Scott J. Hopkins , a physician at the hospital , said a " final diagnosis " was an apparent overdose of alcohol and a tranquilizer , leading to cardiopulmonary arrest and resulting in anoxic brain damage with a persistent vegetated state. // After two weeks of intensive care , Miss Peter was removed from all life support except a feeding tube . She was discharged to the nursing home here on Jan. 7 . The $83. 50-a-day cost of her care is being paid from $15 , 000 that Miss Peter had saved . <> <> ' Minimal ' Possibility // On March 6 , Dr. Hopkins said Miss Peter had suffered " severe brain damage " and " the possibility for any substantial improvement over her present condition is minimal . " Two other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Peter this month . They said in affidavits given Mr. Caprio , the lawyer , that they found her to be in a comatose , vegetated state and that any significant recovery was " extremely doubtful. " // In an interview , Paul Cranmer , the nursing home ' s administrator , who is responsible for Miss Peter ' s welfare , said , " People have always tried to avoid the issue , and nursing homes always are asked to close their eyes when these kind of cases come up. " // " But that is not the case here , " he said . " What is being done in behalf of Miss Peter will finally determine what she would have wanted done for herself. " //
