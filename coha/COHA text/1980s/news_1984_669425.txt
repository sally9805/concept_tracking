Threading down the drowsy lanes of ' ' old Cairo ' ' is like taking a voyage into another , more mystical realm . Compared with the bedlam outside this quarter , the silence here is almost sepulchral . For a tourist , ' ' old Cairo ' ' restores a sense of calm and equilibrium , otherwise lacking in one of the noisiest cities in the world . In Arabic , old Cairo is known as Misr al-Qadimah - ' ' ancient Egypt ' ' - and it really is just that . A few minutes ' walk in any direction will bring you to the oldest mosque , the oldest synagogue , and the oldest Coptic churches in the country. // More than anything else , old Cairo is Coptic . And there is no better reminder of the Pharaonic past than Egypt ' s Copts , who claim lineage to the country ' s ancient inhabitants. // Copts account for an estimated 20 per cent of Egypt ' s population of 46 million . ( For political reasons in this predominantly Muslim country , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trace their ancestry to the world ' s first converts to Christianity . The language of their liturgy is that of the Pharaohs , written in Greek letters . In fact , the word Copt , which in Arabic is qubt , is derived from the Greek aigyptos , meaning Egyptian. // Coptic art and ritual are central to an understanding of early Christianity , for no other Christian community has so faithfully preserved its ancient forms . Unlike Hellenistic and Byzantine art , Coptic art has never been bound by traditional styles . Instead , it illustrates how pagan motifs were adapted by the followers of Christ Jesus in Roman Egypt . Coptic churches follow a combination of Roman and Byzantine basilican forms . The interiors of those in old Cairo are veritable museums of ivory-inlaid wood furniture and iconography : primitive , naive in feeling , and slightly African in style. // The quickest , cheapest , and most convenient way to get to the churches in old Cairo is by train , from the Bab el Luq station downtown near Tahrir ( ' ' liberation ' ' ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalent of 4 cents , and takes you past some of the worst slums in Egypt - from a safe distance . Moreover , you ' ll avoid the perennial battle with the city ' s taxi drivers , who don ' t use meters for foreigners but charge according to your appearance. // The name of the station is Mari Girgis , a very ancient-sounding name which means ' ' St. George , ' ' after a monastery and church nearby . You are now in the oldest part of the city . To your right , facing the downtown area you have just left , is a network of gray and off-white cylindrical structures - the fortress ruins of the original Roman city. // Cairo was founded by medieval Arabs upon the ruins of this older Roman town , called Babylon ( not to be confused with the Mesopotamian Babylon of earlier antiquity ) . The original Roman battlements were constructed in AD 98 by the Emperor Trajan , and rebuilt by Arcadius in AD 395 , by which time Christianity had triumphed over paganism. // The churches here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7th centuries , when Egypt was ruled by Romans , Byzantines , and Arabs in succession . Different guidebooks give different ages for the various churches . No matter . It is enough merely to realize that these buildings are as old as any in the faith. // As you leave Mari Girgis station , beckoning beside the Roman battlements will be the entrance to the Church of the Virgin , called Al-Mu ' allaqah ( ' ' the suspended ' ' ) , because its foundations rest atop the remnants of a Roman gate . Here is the earliest known place of Christian worship in Egypt. // Through the vestibule on Sharia Mari Girgis ( Mari Girgis Street ) is that other , more mystical world . The sounds of the city are left behind , and replaced by birds singing in a narrow courtyard adorned with red flowers and lined with delicately carved wood window screens called mashrabiyyahs. // The best day for a visit is Friday , when the sound of the hymns will quickly draw you away from the courtyard and into the church . Friday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coptic churches are most crowded . This is because in Egypt government offices and many businesses are closed Friday , the Muslim Sabbath . So the Copts take advantage of the holiday to attend church. // From the narrow courtyard of Al-mu ' allaqah , a staircase leads to another vestibule , decorated with gnarled marble relief works , which opens into the church proper. // Inside is a theater of carved wood with Roman and Byzantine columns separating the aisles . The altar is cut off from the congregation by a cypress and sycamore screen , inlaid with ivory . Shafts of sunlight , illuminating the incense smoke and the dust , pour through colored glass windows. // Al-Mu ' allaqah was destroyed and rebuilt in 840 and has undergone many reconstructions since . On the Friday I visited , the sound of the liturgy was spellbinding . The aisles were packed with worshippers , and the procession truly evoked one of the frescoes in the Coptic Museum next door : priests in white robes overlaid with red brocade sashes , wearing gold miters , and carrying large crosses. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of early frescoes and marble reliefs . It is open every day but closes early on Fridays. // Next to the Coptic Museum is a lovely garden where the grass is a deep , dark green - a rarity in this desert city - and the paths are lined with 9th-century limestone windows , as well as other archeological treasures . Near the museum ticket window is a narrow lane leading to the Church of St. Sergius ( Abu Sarga in Arabic ) . // A few steps off the alley lead down into the cavernous , subterranean interior of St. Sergius , where the combination of ancient columns , bare stonewalls partitioning the nave , and carved wood create an extremely primitive ambiance . Beneath the altar is a crypt , where , according to tradition , the holy family sojourned during their flight into Egypt to escape the wrath of Herod , who had decreed the death of the child Jesus ( Matt. 2 : 13-21 ) . // Down the street and around the corner from St. Sergius is the Ben Ezra Synagogue , presently marred by scaffolding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of 32 in Cairo - founded in the 12th century by Jerusalem Rabbi Abraham Ben Ezra . The interior is quite oriental , reminiscent of synagogues elsewhere in the former Ottoman Empire . During 19th-century renovations , several hundred medieval manuscripts were uncovered here , written on gazelle skin , and became known as the Geniza Documents. // A few minutes ' walk north along Sharia Mari Girgis brings one to the Mosque of Amr Ibn el-As , founded in 641 right after the Arab conquest of Egypt , and the oldest mosque in all of North Africa . Amr Ibn el-As was the Arab conqueror of Egypt , yet nothing remains of the original structure he built . Though a product of many subsequent renovations , the mosque - with its gray concrete facade blending in with the color of the dusty Muqattam hills in the background - appears every bit as old as the churches nearby. // By now one is outside the silent precincts of old Cairo , as the mosque lies just outside the quarter . But , like a visit to a monastery , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the confrontation with the outside world. // //
