Bankers pressure Poland to pay interest on its staggering debts <P> Some 500 Western banks and the Polish government last week were playing a multibillion-dollar game of financial chicken . On the one side , some American and European financiers contemplated seizing Polish bank accounts , ships or airliners if the Warsaw government fails to make a $500 million interest payment by the end of the year . If just one of the banks started to grab Polish assets , it could set off a dash for cash that would threaten the stability of international banking by calling down an avalanche of lawsuits , tightening credit around the world , and perhaps causing some financial failures . On the other side , the Polish foreign trade bank stalled for time , hoping to force the banks , which have already lent the Poles more than $14 billion , to put up another $350 million line of credit . <P> Representatives of eight of the European and American banks , acting on behalf of all the Western banks that have made loans to Poland , met last week at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Earlier , six major U.S. banks decided in New York City to deny any additional money for the time being . But after eight hours of talks in Zurich , the bankers broke up , concluding that they had little choice but to let the Polish debt problem drag into the new year . <P> The dilemma of the bankers is clear . They are reluctant to loan any more funds to a country that a leading Wall Street analyst bluntly called " both an economic and a political basket case . " Yet at the same time , the banks would lose billions of dollars if Poland is forced to renounce its debts . The main victims of a default caused by the banks would be the banks . Said one European financier : " If you pull the plug on Poland , you pull it on yourself . " <P> The current troubles of the bankers are largely of their own making . Poland 's foreign debt rose spectacularly throughout the 1970s , while the country 's industrial growth rate slowed during the decade .

The U.S. and 14 other governments have provided Poland with an additional $11 billion , raising the country 's combined debt to an estimated $25.5 billion . <P> Analysts believe that U.S. banks have made about $1.8 billion worth of loans to Poland . Bank of America is " the biggest U.S. lender , with $175 million of debt outstanding . Other major creditors include five New York City banks : Citicorp , Chase Manhattan , Manufacturers Hanover , Morgan Guaranty and Chemical . Each has loans of more than $75 million with Poland . <P> Nonetheless , American banks are not Poland 's leading creditors . That dubious distinction goes to West German financial institutions , which are owed at least $2.7 billion .

Hans Friderichs , Dresdner Bank 's chairman , recently conceded that his bank was setting up a contingency fund against the possible write-off of part of its Polish and other weak loans .
