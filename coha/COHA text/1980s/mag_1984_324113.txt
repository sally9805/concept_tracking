A village struggles back <P> Each night convoys of anywhere from 600 to 1,500 men begin the long march westward . They load down their mules and camels with mortars , heavy machine guns and mines , then scramble along steep , rocky trails through an eerily deserted landscape . Stealing past a government fort and fields still littered with bomb fragments and mines , ignoring the distant thunder of MiGs and flares on the horizon , they cross the highlands along the border and descend toward battle . <P> The men are Afghans who have spent several years in refugee camps in Pakistan . Haunted by homesickness and inspired by a determination to conduct a jihad ( holy war ) against the Soviet occupiers of their country , they are going back home . What they find is not encouraging : entire villages destroyed , orchards burned , fields defoliated . Yet the returning men are rebuilding the fallen roofs and tumbled walls of their former homes . They dig tunnels and enlarge caves to accommodate dwellings , schools and medical clinics ; they farm by night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they use homemade weapons and their knowledge of the difficult terrain to foil the relentless ground attacks of the Soviets . Robert Schultheis , an American freelance writer , spent ten weeks with the men who went back to Dobanday , a once prosperous village that was leveled by the Soviets in 1978 . His report : <P> Afghanistan is a nation of villages . They are the basis of its social structure and its Muslim faith . At communal events like weddings , villagers come together for days to feast , dance and race horses . More practically , the Muslim system of zakat ( tithing ) binds the community together by ensuring that a part of its wealth goes to its poor . Villages have therefore been the primary source of food , support and intelligence for the mujahedin guerrillas who oppose the Soviet-backed regime of Babrak Karmal . That is why the Soviets have used their bombs and tanks to reduce scores of communities to rubble . Of Afghanistan 's 16 million people , more than half have been forced from their homes : up to 5 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kabul , the capital ; 3 million more have fled to refugee camps in Pakistan ; perhaps 500,000 have been killed or badly wounded . <P> The story of Dobanday is typical . Just six years ago , 20,000 people lived in spacious adobe houses scattered across the floor of a green , spring-fed canyon some 45 miles south of Kabul . " Life was good , " recalls Haji Jumah Gul . " We had wheat , corn , rice , melons , apples , cherries , pears and mulberries . Almost everyone had cattle and sheep . " Many of the villagers were prosperous enough to be able to afford a pilgrimage each year to Mecca . <P> All that changed in April 1978 , when Noor Muhammad Taraki , a Soviet-supported Marxist , seized power in Kabul . It would be 20 months before Moscow would send the first of some 100,000 troops to occupy the country , but Soviet advisers were already leading the Afghan army in search-and-destroy missions across the countryside . The residents of Dobanday first became alarmed when they heard that the new regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested two local elders and decreed that all houses in the settlement be thrown open for inspection .
