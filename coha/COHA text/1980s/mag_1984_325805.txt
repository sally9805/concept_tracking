King Hussein had spent the day on military exercises and still wore dark green battle fatigues and a side arm in a holster when he received Time Inc . Editor in Chief Henry Grunwald , TIME Managing Editor Ray Cave and Chief of Correspondents Richard Duncan in Amman last week . Excerpts from the conversation : <P> On U.S. policy . It is not a question of President Reagan , whom I respect very much . I believe he is committed to peace . But the whole scene in Washington has changed so much . The influence of Israel on the Congress is tremendous . I do n't know how this serves U.S. national interests . It is a real tragedy . If I had known that the President was going to have to go before the United Jewish Appeal to appeal to them to help to get us the Stingers , I would not have sought it for the President . <P> If the American elections are so important , and the American constituency is so important , ca n't people realize that we have a constituency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are at the expense of our credit , which is diminishing by being your friends ? Until a more balanced attitude prevails in the US. , conditioned by American national interests in the region , relations between the U.S. and the Arab world can not be normal . <P> On pressure to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem . Why did this issue come out now , and at the initiative of the U.S. Congress and not the government of Israel ? This is the sad situation we 're in : Israel can receive arms , grants , help and all other kinds of assistance without question . Israel has a right to veto anything the U.S. decides to do for any of its Arab friends . <P> There is a double standard in all of this . Consider your stand on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . Why are the guerrillas there seen as " mujahedin " or freedom fighters while here the Palestinians are seen by the U.S. as " terrorists " who have no rights ? And the settlements . They were first described by the U.S. as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " now as an " impediment . " Shortly they will be just an " eyesore . " <P> On the Palestine Liberation Organization . My talks with P.L.O . Chairman Yasser Arafat have been constructive . I am going to try to influence the P.L.O . to continue along a path that could lead to a situation where both of us would contribute to the cause of peace in the region and alleviate the tremendous pressure on the people under occupation and free the land . Whether we are willing to negotiate or not , when we look at Israel 's West Bank settlements , we see a deadlocked , impossible situation . <P> On Lebanon and Syria . I believe that what happened in Lebanon threatens Syria , which is composed of elements similar to those of Lebanon . Jordan is anxious not to fall victim to the process of fragmentation in the region . Our independence , our Arab character and identity as a people are at stake . <P> In 1970 we had a Syrian invasion of this country . In 1980 we almost had an invasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It could happen again . <P> On the Soviets . The U.S. is in a position to launch peace initiatives in the Middle East ; the Soviet Union is not . But the Soviet Union can block progress on any peace initiative from which it is excluded . So why not involve the Russians and call their bluff ?
