. AWAKENINGAND THEY TOLD US WE WOULD N'T DREAM , THOUGHT HEYWOODFloyd , more with surprise than annoyance . The glorious pink glow that surrounded him was very soothing ; it reminded him of barbecues and the crackling logs of Christmas fires . But there was no warmth ; indeed , he felt a distinct though not uncomfortablecoldness . Voices were murmuring , just too softly for him to understand the words . They became louder  --  but still he could not understand . " Surely , " he said in sudden amazement , " I ca n't be dreaming in Russian ! " " No , Heywood , " answered a woman 's voice . " You 're not dreaming . It 's time to get out of bed . " The lovely glow faded ; he opened his eyes , and had a blurred glimpse of a flashlight being withdrawn from his face . He was*41ARTHUR C.

You can open your eyes now . " The figures came into focus  --  first Dr. Rudenko , then Captain Orlova . But something had happened to Tanya since he had seen her , only an hour ago . When Floyd identified the cause , it was almost a physical shock . " You 've grown your hair back ! " " I hope you think it 's an improvement . I ca n't say the same about your beard .

TSIENWHEN HEYWOOD FLOYD 'S VOICE CAME FROM THE COMSET SPEAKER , the two dolphins suddenly stopped circling around the pool and swam over to its edge .

" The standard of on-board English ranges from absolutely per- fect  --  Chief Engineer Sasha Kovalev could earn a living as a BBC announcer  --  down to the **39;9942;TOOLONG **30;9983;TOOLONG variety . The only one who is n't fluent is Zenia Marchenko , who replaced Irina Yakunina at the last moment .

" There was a brief hissing pause , then an obviously synthetic voice said : " This terminates Transmission Four Hundred ThirtytwoStroke Seven from Spacecraft Leonov . " As Caroline Floyd switched off the speaker , the two dolphins slid beneath the surface of the pool and glided out into the Pacific , leaving scarcely a ripple in the water . When he realized that his friends were gone , Christopher began to cry . His mother picked him up in her arms and tried to comfort him , but it was a long time before she succeeded. 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 478 . TRANSIT OF JUPITERTHE IMAGE OF JUPITER , WITH ITS RIBBONS OF WHITE CLOUD , ITSmottled bands of salmon pink , and the Great Red Spot staring out like a baleful eye , hung steady on the flight-deck projection screen . It was three quarters full , but no one was looking at the illuminated disk ; all eyes were focused on the crescent of darknessat its edge . There , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet its moment of truth . This is absurd , thought Floyd . We ca n't possibly see anything across forty million kilometers . And it does n't matter ; the radio will tell us all we want to know . Tsien had closed down all voice , video , and data circuits two hours before , as the long-range antennas were withdrawn into the protective shadow of the heat shield . Only the omnidirectionalbeacon was still transmitting , accurately pinpointing the Chinese ship 's position as it plunged toward that ocean of continent-sizedclouds . The shrill beep . . . beep . . . beep . . . was 46the only sound in Leonov 's control room . Each of those pulses had left Jupiter more than two minutes earlier ; by this time , their source might already be a cloud of incandescent gas , dispersingin the Jovian stratosphere . The signal was fading , becoming noisy . The beeps were gettingdistorted ; several dropped out completely , then the sequencereturned . A plasma sheath was building up around Tsien and soon would cut off all communications until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Posmotri ! " cried Max . " There it is ! " At first Floyd could see nothing . Then , just off the edge of the illuminated disk , he made out a tiny star  --  gleaming where no star could possibly be , against the darkened face of Jupiter . It appeared quite motionless , though he knew it must be movingat a hundred kilometers a second . Slowly it grew in brilliance ; and then it was no longer a dimensionless point , but was becoming elongated . A man-made comet was streaking across the Jovian night sky , leaving a trail of incandescence thousands of kilometers in length . One last badly distorted and curiously drawn-out beep sounded from the tracking beacon , then only the meaningless hiss of Jupiter 's own radiation , one of those many cosmic voices that had nothing to do with Man or his works . Tsien was inaudible , but not yet invisible . For they could see that the tiny elongated spark had indeed moved appreciably away from the sunward face of the planet and would soon disappear into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plan , Jupiter would have captured the ship , destroying its unwantedvelocity . When it emerged from behind the giant world , it would be another Jovian satellite . The spark flickered out . Tsien had rounded the curve of the planet and was heading over the nightside . There would be nothing to see , or to hear , until it emerged from shadow  --  if all went well , in just under an hour . It would be a very long hour for the Chinese . To Chief Scientist Vasili Orlov and communications engineer Sasha Kovalov , the hour went extremely quickly . There was much they could learn from observations of that little star ; itsARTHUR C. CLARKE * 48 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 49times of appearance and disappearance and , above all , the Dopplershift of the radio beacon gave vital information about Tsien 's new orbit . Leonov 's computers were already digesting the figures , and spitting out projected times of reemergence based on various assumptions about rates of deceleration in the Jovian atmosphere . Vasili switched off the computer display , spun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and addressed the patiently waiting audience . " Earliest reappearance is in forty-two minutes . Why do n't you spectators go for a walk , so we can concentrate on getting all this into good shape ? See you in thirty-five minutes . Shoo ! Nu-ukhodi ! " Reluctantly , the unwanted bodies left the bridge  --  but , to Vasill'sdisgust , everyone was back again in little more than thirty minutes . He was still chiding them for their lack of faith in his calculations when the familiar beep . . . beep . . . beep . . . of Tsien 's tracking beacon burst from the loudspeakers . Vasili looked astonished and mortified , but soon joined in the spontaneous round of applause ; Floyd could not see who first started the clapping . Rivals though they might be , they were all astronauts together , as far from home as any men had ever traveled  --  " Ambassadorsfor Mankind , " in the noble words of the first UN Space Treaty . Even if they did not want the Chinese to succeed , neither did they wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also involved , Floyd could not help thinking . Now the odds in Leonov 's own favor were significantly improved ; Tsien had demonstrated that the aerobrakingmaneuver was indeed possible . The data on Jupiter were correct ; its atmosphere did not contain unexpected and perhaps fatal surprises . " Well ! " said Tanya . " I suppose we should send them a messageof congratulations . But even if we did , they would n't acknowledgeit . " Some of his colleagues were still making fun of Vasili , who was staring at his computer output in frank disbelief . " I do n't understand it ! " he exclaimed . " They should still bebehind Jupiter ! Sasha  --  give me a velocity reading on their beacon ! " Another silent dialog was held with the computer ; then Vasili gave a long , low whistle . " Something 's wrong . They 're in a capture orbit , all right  --  but it wo n't let them make a rendezvous with Discovery . The orbit they 're on now will take them way beyond Io  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another five minutes . " " Anyway , they must be in a safe orbit , " said Tanya . " They can always make corrections later . " " Perhaps . But that could cost them days , even if they have the fuel . Which I doubt . " " So we may still beat them . " " Do n't be such an optimist . We 're still three weeks from Jupiter . They can make a dozen orbits before we get there , and choose the most favorable one for a rendezvous . " " Again  --  assuming that they have enough propellant . " " Of course . And that 's something we can only make educated guesses about . " All this conversation took place in such rapid and excited Russian that Floyd was left far behind . When Tanya took pity on him and explained that Tsien had overshot and was heading for the outer satellites , his first reaction was : " Then they may be in serious trouble . What will you do if they appeal for help ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them doing that ? They 're much too proud . Anyway , it would be impossible . We ca n't change our mission profile , as you know perfectly well . Even if we had the fuel ... " " You 're right , of course ; but it might be difficult to explain that to the ninety-nine percent of the human race that does n't understand orbital mechanics . We should start thinking about some of the political complications  --  it would look bad for all of us if we ca n't help . Vasili , will you give me their final orbit , as soon as you 've worked it out ? I 'm going down to my cabin to do some homework . " Floyd 's cabin , or rather one-third of a cabin , was still partlyARTHUR C. CLARKE * 50 11 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 51 full of stores , many of them stacked in the curtained bunks that would be occupied by Chandra and Curnow when they emerged from their long slumbers . He had managed to clear a small work- ing space for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another whole two cubic meters  --  just as soon as someone could be spared to help with the furniture removing . Floyd unlocked his little communications console , set the de- cryption keys , and called for the information on Tsien that had been transmitted to him from Washington . He wondered if his hosts had had any luck in unscrambling it ; the cipher was based on the product of two hundred-digit prime numbers , and the National Security Agency had staked its reputation on the claim that the fastest computer in existence could not crack it before the Big Crunch at the end of the Universe . It was a claim that could never be proved  --  only disproved . Once again he stared intently at the excellent photographs of the Chinese ship , taken when it had revealed its true colors and was just about to leave Earth orbit . There were later shots  --  not so clear , because by then it had been far away from the prying cameras  --  of the final stage as it hurtled toward Jupiter . Those were the ones that interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and estimates of performance . Granted the most optimistic assumptions , it was difficult to see what the Chinese hoped to do . They must have burned up at least ninety percent of their propellant in that mad dash across the Solar System . Unless it was literally a suicide mission  --  something that could not be ruled out  --  only a plan involving hibernation and later rescue made any sense . And Intelligence did not believe that Chinese hibernation technology was suffi- sufficiently far advanced to make that a viable option . But Intelligence was frequently wrong , and even more often confused by the avalanche of raw facts it had to evaluate  --  the " noise " in its information circuits . It had done a remarkable job on Tsien , considering the shortness of time , but Floyd wished that the material sent to him had been more carefully filtered . Some of it was obvious junk , of no possible connection with the mission . Nevertheless , when you did not know what you were looking for , it was important to avoid all prejudices and preconceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even nonsensical , might turn out to be a vital clue . With a sigh , Floyd started once more to skim the five hundred pages of data , keeping his mind as blankly receptive as possible while diagrams , charts , photographs  --  some so smudgy that they could represent almost anything  --  news items , lists of delegates to scientific conferences , titles of technical publications , and even commercial documents scrolled swiftly down the high-resolutionscreen . A very efficient industrial espionage system had obviously been extremely busy ; who would have thought that so many Japanese holomemory modules or Swiss gas-flow microcontrollersor German radiation detectors could have been traced to a destination in the dried lake bed of Lop Nor  --  the first milepost on their way to Jupiter ? Some of the items must have been included by accident ; they could not possibly relate to the mission . If the Chinese had placed a secret order for one thousand infrared sensors through a dummy corporation in Singapore , that was only the concern of the military ; it seemed highly unlikely that Tsien expected to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny  --  specialized surveying and prospecting equipment from Glacier Geophysics , Inc. , of Anchorage , Alaska . What lamebrain imagined that a deep-space expedition would have any needThe smile froze on Floyd 's lips ; he felt the skin crawl on the back of his neck . My God  --  they would n't dare ! But they had already dared greatly ; and now , at last , everything made sense . He flashed back to the photos and conjectured plans of the Chinese ship . Yes , it was just conceivable  --  those flutings at the rear , alongside the drive deflection electrodes , would be about the right size .. . Floyd called the bridge . " Vasili , " he said , " have you worked out their orbit yet ? " " Yes , I have , " the navigator replied , in a curiously subdued voice . Floyd could tell at once that something had turned up . He took a long shot . " They 're making a rendezvous with Europa , are n't they ? " There was an explosive gasp of disbelief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chyort voz'mi ! How did you know ? " " I did n't  --  I 've just guessed it . " " There ca n't be any mistake  --  I 've checked the figures to six places . The braking maneuver worked out exactly as they intended . They 're right on course for Europa  --  it could n't have happened by chance . They 'll be there in seventeen hours . " " And go into orbit . " " Perhaps ; it would n't take much propellant . But what would be the point ? " " I 'll risk another guess . They 'll do a quick survey  --  and then they 'll land . " " You 're crazy  --  or do you know something we do n't ? " " No  --  it 's just a matter of simple deduction . You 're going to start kicking yourself for missing the obvious . " " Okay , Sherlock , why should anyone want to land on Europa ? What 's there , for heaven 's sake ? " Floyd was enjoying his little moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . " What 's on Europa ? Only the most valuable substance in the Universe . " He had overdone it ; Vasili was no fool , and snatched the answerfrom his lips . " Of course  --  water ! " " Exactly . Billions and billions of tons of it . Enough to fill up the propellant tanks  --  go cruising around all the satellites , and still have plenty left for the rendezvous with Discovery and the voyage home . I hate to say this , Vasili  --  but our Chinese friends have outsmarted us again . " Always assuming , of course , that they can get away with it . " 9 . THE ICE OF THE GRAND CANALAPART FROM THE JET-BLACK SKY , THE PHOTO MIGHT HAVE BEEN taken almost anywhere in the polar regions of Earth ; there was nothing in the least alien about the sea of wrinkled ice that stretched all the way out to the horizon . Only the five spacesuitedfigures in the foreground proclaimed that the panorama was of another world . Even now , the secretive Chinese had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the frozen Europan icescape were merely the chief scientist , the commander , the navigator , the first engineer , the second engineer . It was also ironic , Floyd could not help thinking , that everyone on Earth had seen the already historic photograph an hour before it reached Leonov , so much closer to the scene . But Tsien 's transmissionswere relayed on such a tight beam that it was impossible to intercept them ; Leonov could receive only its beacon , * 53ARTHUR C. CLARKE * 54 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 55broadcasting impartially in all directions . Even that was inaudi- ble more than half the time , as Europa 's rotation carried it out of sight , or the satellite itself was eclipsed by the monstrous bulk of Jupiter . All the scanty news of the Chinese mission had to be relayed from Earth . The ship had touched down , after its initial survey , on one of the few islands of solid rock that protruded through the crust of ice covering virtually the entire moon . That ice was flat from pole to pole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapes , no drifting snow to build up layer upon layer into slowly moving hills . Meteorites might fall upon airless Europa , but never a flake of snow . The only forces molding its surface were the steady tug of gravity , reducing all elevations to one uniform level , and the incessant quakes caused by the other sat- ellites as they passed and repassed Europa in their orbits . Jupiter itself , despite its far greater mass , had much less effect . The Jo- vian tides had finished their work aeons ago , insuring that Eu- ropa remained locked forever with one face turned toward its giant master . All this had been known since the Voyager flyby missions of the 1970s , the Galileo surveys of the 1980s , and the Kepler land- ings of the 1990s . But , in a few hours , the Chinese had learned more about Europa than all the previous missions combined . That knowledge they were keeping to themselves ; one might re- gret it , but few would deny that they had earned the right to do so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was their right to annex the satellite . For the first time in history , a nation had laid claim to another world , and all the news media of Earth were arguing over the legal position . Though the Chi- nese pointed out , at tedious length , that they had never signed the ' 02 UN Space Treaty and so were not bound by its provi- sions , that did nothing to quell the angry protests . Suddenly , Europa was the biggest news in the Solar System . And the man-on-the-spot ( at least to the nearest few million kilometers ) was in great demand . " This is Heywood Floyd , aboard Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov , on course for Jupiter . But as you can well imagine , all our thoughts are now focused upon Europa . " At this very moment I 'm looking at it through the most powerfulof the ship 's telescopes ; under this magnification , it 's ten times larger than the Moon as you see it with the naked eye . And it 's a really weird sight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small brown patches . It 's covered with an intricate network of narrow lines , curling and weaving in all directions . In fact , it looks very much like a photo from a medical textbook , showing a pattern of veins and arteries . " A few of these features are hundreds  --  or even thousands  --  of kilometers long , and look rather like the illusory canals that PercivalLowell and other early-twentieth-century astronomers imagined they 'd seen on Mars . " But Europa 's canals are n't an illusion , though of course they 're not artificial . What 's more , they do contain water  --  or at least ice . For the satellite is almost entirely covered by ocean , averaging fifty kilometers deep . " Because it 's so far from the sun , Europa 's surface temperatureis extremely low  --  about a hundred and fifty degrees below freezing . So one might expect its single ocean to be a solid block of ice . " Surprisingly , that is n't the case because there 's a lot of heat generated inside Europa by tidal forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighboring Io . " So the ice is continually melting , breaking up , and freezing , forming cracks and lanes like those in the floating ice sheets in our own polar regions . It 's that intricate tracery of cracks I 'm seeing now ; most of them are dark and very ancient  --  perhaps millions of years old . But a few are almost pure white ; they 're the new ones that have just opened up , and have a crust only a few centimeters thick . " Tsien has landed right beside one of these white streaks  --  the **30;10015;TOOLONG feature that 's been christened the Grand Canal . Presumably the Chinese intend to pump its water into their propellant tanks , so that they can explore the Jovian satellite system and then return to Earth . That may not be easy , ARTHUR C. CLARKE but they 'll certainly have studied the landing site with great care , and must know what they 're doing . " It 's obvious , now , why they 've taken such a risk  --  and why they claim Europa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key to the entire outer Solar System . Though there 's also water on Ganymede , it 's all frozen , and also less accessible because of that satellite 's more powerful gravity . " And there 's another point that 's just occurred to me . Even if the Chinese do get stranded on Europa , they might be able to survive until a rescue mission is arranged . They have plenty of power , there may be useful minerals in the area  --  and we know that the Chinese are the experts on synthetic-food production . It would n't be a very luxurious life ; but I have some friends who would accept it happily for that staggering view of Jupiter sprawled across the sky  --  the view we expect to see ourselves , in just a few days .

" Floyd removed his button microphone , locked the telescope into position and extricated himself from the tiny viewing blis- ter . As he left , he almost collided with Nikolai Ternovsky , ob- viously on a similar mission . " I 'm about to steal your best quotes for Radio Moscow , Woody . Hope you do n't mind . " " You 're welcome , tovarishch . Anyway , how could I stop you ? " Up on the bridge , Captain Orlova was looking thoughtfully at a dense mass of words and figures on the main display .

" " I 'm not surprised  --  merely lost in admiration . Go on , please . " " That may be a coincidence , but those pumps would be just the right size . Making educated guesses about pipe deployment , drilling through the ice and so on  --  well , we think they could lift off again in five days . " " Five days !

A CRY FROM EUROPASLEEPING IN ZERO GRAVITY IS A SKILL THAT HAS TO BE LEARNED ; IThad taken Floyd almost a week to find the best way of anchoring legs and arms so that they did not drift into uncomfortable positions . Now he was an expert , and was not looking forward to the return of weight ; indeed , the very idea gave him occasional nightmares . Someone was shaking him awake . No  --  he must still be dreaming ! Privacy was sacred aboard a spaceship ; nobody ever entered another crew member 's chambers without first asking permission . He clenched his eyes shut , but the shaking continued . " Dr. Floyd  --  please wake up ! You 're wanted on the flight deck ! " And nobody called him Dr. Floyd ; the most formal salutation he had received for weeks was Doc . What was happening ? Reluctantly , he opened his eyes . He was in his tiny cabin , * 59ARTHUR C. CLARKE * 60 I ! 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his mind told him ; then why was he looking at  --  Europa ? They were still millions of kilometers away . There were the familiar reticulations , the patterns of triangles and polygons formed by intersecting lines . And surely that was the Grand Canal itself  --  no , it was n't quite right . How could it be , since he was still in his little cabin aboard Leonov ? " Dr. Floyd ! " He became fully awake , and realized that his left hand was floating just a few centimeters in front of his eyes . How strange that the pattern of lines across the palm was so uncannily like the map of Europa ! But economical Mother Nature was always repeating herself , on such vastly different scales as the swirl of milk stirred into coffee , the cloud lanes of a cyclonic storm , the arms of a spiral nebula . " Sorry , Max , " he said . " What 's the problem ? Is something wrong ? " " We think so  --  but not with us . Tsien 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were strapped in their seats on the flight deck ; the rest of the crew orbited anxiously around convenient handholds , or watched on the monitors . " Sorry to wake you up , Heywood , " Tanya apologized brusquely . " Here 's the situation . Ten minutes ago we had a Class One Priority from Mission Control . Tsien 's gone off the air . It happened very suddenly , in the middle of a cipher message ; there were a few seconds of garbled transmission  --  then nothing . " " Their beacon ? " " That 's stopped as well . We ca n't receive it either . " " Phew ! Then it must be serious  --  a major breakdown . Any theories ? " " Lots  --  but all guesswork . An explosion  --  landslide  --  earth- quake : who knows ?

The closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could see front that distance . " " Then there 's absolutely nothing we can do . " " Not quite , Heywood . Mission Control has a suggestion . They 'd like us to swing our big dish around , just in case we can pick up any weak emergency transmissions . It 's  --  how do you say ?  --  a long shot , but worth trying . What do you think ? " Floyd 's first reaction was strongly negative . " That will mean breaking our link with Earth . " " Of course ; but we 'll have to do that anyway , when we go around Jupiter . And it will only take a couple of minutes to reestablishthe circuit . " Floyd remained silent . The suggestion was perfectly reasonable , yet it worried him obscurely . After puzzling for several seconds , he suddenly realized why he was so opposed to the idea . Discovery 's troubles had started when the big dish  --  the main antenna complex  --  had lost its lock on Earth , for reasons which even now were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there was no danger of a similar situation arising here . Leonov 's computers were small , autonomous units ; there was no single controlling intelligence . At least , no nonhuman one . The Russians were still waiting patiently for his answer . " I agree , " he said at last . " Let Earth know what we 're doing , and start listening . I suppose you 'll try all the SPACE MAYDAY frequencies . " " Yes , as soon as we 've worked out the Doppler corrections . How 's it going , Sasha ? " " Give me another two minutes , and I 'll have the automatic search running . How long should we listen ? " The captain barely paused before giving her answer . Floyd had often admired Tanya Orlova 's decisiveness , and had once told her so . In a rare flash of humor , she had replied : " Woody , a commander can be wrong , but never uncertain . " " Listen for fifty minutes , and report back to Earth for ten . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hear ; the automatic circuits were better at sifting the radio noise than any human senses . Nevertheless , from time to time Sasha turned up the audio monitor , ARTHUR C. CLARKE * 62 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 63and the roar of Jupiter 's radiation belts filled the cabin . It was a sound like the waves breaking on all the beaches of Earth , with occasional explosive cracks from superbolts of lightning in the Jovian atmosphere . Of human signals , there was no trace ; and one by one , the members of the crew not on duty drifted quietly away . While he was waiting , Floyd did some mental calculations . Whatever had happened to Tsien was already two hours in the past , since the news had been relayed from Earth . But Leonov should be able to pick up a direct message after less than a minute 's delay , so the Chinese had already had ampletime to get back on the air . Their continued silence suggestedsome catastrophic failure , and he found himself weaving endless scenarios of disaster . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sasha swung the ship 's antenna complex back toward Earth , and reported failure . While he was using the rest of the ten minutes to send a backlog of messages , he looked inquiringly at the captain . " Is it worth trying again ? " he said in a voice that clearly expressed his own pessimism . " Of course . We may cut back the search time  --  but we 'll keep listening . " On the hour , the big dish was once more focused upon Europa . And almost at once , the automatic monitor started flashing itS ALERT light . Sasha 's hand darted to the audio gain , and the voice of Jupiter filled the cabin . Superimposed upon that , like a whisper heard against a thunderstorm , was the faint but completely unmistakablesound of human speech . It was impossible to identify the language , though Floyd felt certain , from the intonation and rhythm , that it was not Chinese , but some European tongue . Sasha played skillfully with fine-tuning and band-width controls , and the words became clearer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maddeningly unintelligible . There is one combination of sounds that every human ear candetect instantly , even in the noisiest environment . When it suddenlyemerged from the Jovian background , it seemed to Floyd that he could not possibly be awake , but was trapped in some fantastic dream . His colleagues took a little longer to react ; then they stared at him with equal amazement  --  and a slowly dawningsuspicion . For the first recognizable words from Europa were : " Dr. Floyd  --  Dr. Floyd  --  I hope you can hear me. " 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 6511 . ICE AND VACUUM " WHO IS IT ? " WHISPERED SOMEONE , TO A CHORUS OF SHUSHES . Floyd raised his hands in a gesture of ignorance  --  and , he hoped , innocence. " ... know you are aboard Leonov . . . may not have much time . . . aiming my suit antenna where I think ... " The signal vanished for agonizing seconds , then came back much clearer , though not appreciably louder. .. relay this information to Earth . Tsien destroyed three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit radio  --  no idea if it has enough range , but it 's the only chance . Please listen carefully . THERE IS LIFE ON EUROPA . I repeat : THERE IS LIFE ON EUROPA ... " The signal faded again . A stunned silence followed that no one attempted to interrupt . While he was waiting , Floyd searched his memory furiously . He could not recognize the voice* 64it might have been that of any Western-educated Chinese . Probably it was someone he had met at a scientific conference , but unless the speaker identified himself he would never know. " ... soon after local midnight . We were pumping steadily and the tanks were almost half full . Dr. Lee and I went out to check the pipe insulation . Tsien stands  --  stood  --  about thirty meters from the edge of the Grand Canal . Pipes go directly from it and down through the ice . Very thin  --  not safe to walk on . The warm upwelling ... " Again a long silence . Floyd wondered if the speaker was moving , and had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five kilowatts of lighting strung up on the ship . Like a Christmas tree  --  beautiful , shining right through the ice . Glorious colors . Lee saw it first  --  a huge dark mass rising up from the depths . At first we thought it was a school of fish  --  too large for a single organism  --  then it started to break through the ice . " Dr. Floyd , I hope you can hear me . This is Professor Chang  --  we met in ' 02  --  Boston I.A.U. conference . " Instantly , incongruously , Floyd 's thoughts were a billion kilometersaway . He vaguely remembered that reception , after the closing session of the International Astronomical Union Congress  --  thelast one that the Chinese had attended before the SecondCultural Revolution . And now he recalled Chang very distinctly  --  a small , humorous astronomer and exobiologist with a good fund of jokes . He was n't joking now. " . . . like huge strands of wet seaweed , crawling along the ground . Lee ran back to the ship to get a camera  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing moved so slowly I could easily outrun it . I was much more excited than alarmed . Thought I knew what kind of creature it was  --  I 've seen pictures of the kelp forests off California  --  but I was quite wrong . " . . . I could tell it was in trouble . It could n't possibly survive at a temperature a hundred and fifty below its normal environment . It was freezing solid as it moved forward  --  bits were breaking off like glass  --  but it was still advancing toward the ship , a black tidal wave , slowing down all the time . ARTHUR C. CLARKE * 66 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 67 " I was still so surprised that I could n't think straight and I could n't imagine what it was trying to do ... " " Is there any way we can call him back ? " Floyd whispered urgently . " No  --  it 's too late . Europa will soon be behind Jupiter . We 'll have to wait until it comes out of eclipse . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice tunnel as it advanced . Perhaps this was insulating it from the cold  --  the way termites protect themselves from sunlight with their little corridorsof mud. " ... tons of ice on the ship . The radio antennas broke off first . Then I could see the landing legs beginning to buckle  --  all in slow motion , like a dream . " Not until the ship started to topple did I realize what the thing was trying to do  --  and then it was too late . We could have saved ourselves  --  if we 'd only switched off those lights . " Perhaps it 's a phototrope , its biological cycle triggered by the sunlight that filters through the ice . Or it could have been attractedlike a moth to a candle . Our floodlights must have been more brilliant than anything that Europa has ever known .. . " Then the ship crashed . I saw the hull split , a cloud of snowflakesform as moisture condensed . All the lights went out , except for one , swinging back and forth on a cable a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened immediately after that . The next thing I remember , I was standing under the light , beside the wreck of the ship , with a fine powdering of fresh snow all around me . I could see my footsteps in it very clearly . I must have run there ; perhaps only a minute or two had elapsed .. . " The plant  --  I still thought of it as a plant  --  was motionless . I wondered if it had been damaged by the impact ; large sections  --  as thick as a man 's arm  --  had splintered off , like broken twigs . " Then the main trunk started to move again . It pulled away from the hull , and began to crawl toward me . That was when I knew for certain that the thing was light-sensitive : I was standingimmediately under the thousand-watt lamp , which had stopped swinging now . " Imagine an oak tree  --  better still , a banyan with its multipletrunks and roots  --  flattened out by gravity and trying to creep along the ground . It got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spread out until it had made a perfect circle around me . Presumably that was the limit of its tolerance  --  the point at which photoattraction turned to repulsion . After that , nothing happened for several minutes . I wondered if it was dead  --  frozen solid at last . " Then I saw that large buds were forming on many of the branches . It was like watching a time-lapse film of flowers opening . In fact I thought they were flowers  --  each about as big as a man 's head . " Delicate , beautifully colored membranes started to unfold . Even then , it occurred to me that no one  --  no thing  --  could ever have seen these colors before ; they had no existence until we brought our lights  --  our fatal lights  --  to this world .

" There were scores of the big flowers , in various stages of unfolding . Now they reminded me of butterflies , just emerging from the chrysalis  --  wings crumpled , still feeble  --  I was getting closer and closer to the truth . " But they were freezing  --  dying as quickly as they formed . Then , one after another , they dropped off from the parent buds . For a few moments they flopped around like fish stranded on dry land  --  and at last I realized exactly what they were . Those membranes were n't petals  --  they were fins , or their equivalent . This was the free-swimming , larval stage of the creature . Probablyit spends much of its life rooted on the seabed , then sends these mobile offspring in search of new territory . Just like the corals of Earth 's oceans . " I knelt down to get a closer look at one of the little creatures . The beautiful colors were fading now , to a drab brown . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they froze . But it was still moving feebly , and as I approached it tried to avoid me . I wondered how it sensed my presence . ARTHUR C. CLARKE * 68 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 69 " Then I noticed that the stamens  --  as I 'd called them  --  all carriedbright blue dots at their tips . They looked like tiny star sapphires  --  orthe blue eyes along the mantle of a scallop  --  aware of light , but unable to form true images . As I watched , the vivid blue faded , the sapphires became dull , ordinary stones .. . " Dr. Floyd  --  or anyone else who is listening  --  I have n't much more time ; Jupiter will soon block my signal . But I 've almost finished . " I knew then what I had to do . The cable to that thousandwattlamp was hanging almost to the ground . I gave it a few tugs , and the light went out in a shower of sparks . " I wondered if it was too late . For a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall of tangled branches around me , and kicked it . " Slowly , the creature started to unweave itself , and to retreat back to the Canal . There was plenty of light  --  I could see everythingperfectly . Ganymede and Callisto were in the sky  --  Jupiter was a huge , thin crescent  --  and there was a big auroral display on the nightside , at the Jovian end of the Io flux tube . There was no need to use my helmet light . " I followed the creature all the way back to the water , encouragingit with more kicks when it slowed down , feeling the fragments of ice crunching all the time beneath my boots . . . As it neared the Canal , it seemed to gain strength and energy , as if it knew that it was approaching its natural home . I wondered if it would survive , to bud again . " It disappeared through the surface , leaving a few last dead larvae on the alien land . The exposed free water bubbled for a few minutes until a scab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I walked back to the ship to see if there was anything to salvage  --  I do n't want to talk about that . " I 've only two requests to make , Doctor . When the taxonomistsclassify this creature , I hope they 'll name it after me . " And  --  when the next ship comes home  --  ask them to take our hones hack to China . " Jupiter will he cutting us off in a few minutes . I wish I knewwhether anyone was receiving me . Anyway , I 'll repeat this messagewhen we 're in line of sight again  --  if my suit 's life-support system lasts that long . " This is Professor Chang on Europa , reporting the destruction of spaceship Tsien . We landed beside the Grand Canal and set up our pumps at the edge of the ice  --  " The signal faded abruptly , came back for a moment , then disappearedcompletely below the noise level . Although Leonov listened again on the same frequency , there was no further messagefrom Professor Chang . DISCOVERY12 . DOWNHILL RUNTHE SHIP WAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had long since passed the gravitational noman's-landwhere the four tiny outer moons  --  Sinope , Pasiphae , Ananke , and Carme  --  wobbled along their retrograde and wildly eccentric orbits . Undoubtedly captured asteroids , and completelyirregular in shape . The largest was only thirty kilometers across . Jagged , splintered rocks of no interest to anyone except planetary geologists , their allegiance wavered continually between the Sun and Jupiter . One day , the Sun would recapture them completely . But Jupiter might retain the second group of four , at half the distance of the others . Elara , Lysithea , Himalia , and Leda were fairly close together , and lying in almost the same plane . There was speculation that they had once been part of a single body ; if so , the parent would have been barely a hundred kilometers across. * 73ARTHUR C. CLARKE * 74 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 75 Though only Carme and Leda came close enough to show disks visible to the naked eye , they were greeted like old friends . Here was the first landfall after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The last hours were ticking away ; the most critical phase of the entire mission was approaching  --  the entry into the Jovian atmosphere . Jupiter was already larger than the Moon in the skies of Earth , and the giant inner satellites could be clearly seen moving around it . They all showed noticeable disks and distinctive col- oring , though they were still too far away for any markings to be visible . The eternal ballet they performed  --  disappearing behind Jupiter , reappearing to transit the daylight face with their ac- companying shadows  --  was an endlessly engaging spectacle . It was one that astronomers had watched ever since Galileo had first glimpsed it almost exactly four centuries ago ; but the crew of Leonov were the only living men and women to have seen it with unaided eyes . The interminable chess games had ceased ; off-duty hours were spent at the telescopes , or in earnest conversation , or lis- tening to music , usually while gazing at the view outside . And at least one shipboard romance had reached a culmination : the frequent disappearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much good-natured banter . They were , thought Floyd , an oddly matched pair . Max was a big , handsome blond who had been a champion gymnast , reach- ing the finals of the 2000 Olympics . Though he was in his early thirties , he had an open-faced , almost boyish expression . This was not altogether misleading ; despite his brilliant engineering record , he often struck Floyd as naive and unsophisticated  --  one of those people who are pleasant to talk to , but not for too long . Outside his own field of undoubted expertise he was engaging but rather shallow . Zenia  --  at twenty-nine , the youngest on board  --  was still something of a mystery . Since no one wished to talk about it , Floyd had never raised the subject of her injuries , and his Wash- ington sources could provide no information . Obviously she had been involved in some serious accident , but it might have been nothing more unusual than a car crash . The theory that she had been on a secret space mission  --  still part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thanks to the global tracking networks , no such thing had been possible for fifty years . In addition to her physical and doubtless psychological scars , Zenia labored under yet another handicap . She was a last-minutereplacement , and everyone knew it . Irina Yakunina was to have been dietician and medical assistant aboard Leonov before that unfortunate argument with a hang-glider broke too many bones . Every day at 1800 GMT the crew of seven plus one passenger gathered in the tiny common room that separated the flight deck from the galley and sleeping quarters . The circular table at its center was just big enough for eight people to squeeze around ; when Chandra and Curnow were revived , it would be unable to accommodate everyone , and two extra seats would have to be fitted in somewhere else . Though the " Six O'Clock Soviet , " as the daily round-table conference was called , seldom lasted more than ten minutes , it played a vital role in maintaining morale . Complaints , suggestions , criticisms , progress reports  --  anything could be raised , subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very seldom exercised . Typical items on the nonexistent agenda were requests for changes in the menu , appeals for more private communication time with Earth , suggested movie programs , exchange of news and gossip , and good-natured needling of the heavily outnumberedAmerican contingent . Things would change , Floyd warned them , when his colleagues came out of hibernation , and the odds improved from 1 in 7 to 3 in 9 . He did not mention his private belief that Curnow could outtalk or outshout any three other people aboard . When he was not sleeping , much of Floyd 's own time was spent in the common room  --  partly because , despite its smallness , it was much less claustrophobic than his own tiny cubicle . It was also cheerfully decorated , all available flat surfaces being covered with photos of beautiful land- and seascapes , sporting events , portraits of popular videostars , and other reminders ofARTHUR C. CLARKE * 76Earth . Pride of place , however , was given to an original Leonov painting  --  his 1965 study " Near the Moon , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lieutenant  --  colonel , he left Voshkod II and became the first man in history to perform an extravehicular excursion . Clearly the work of a talented amateur , rather than a professional , it showed the cratered edge of the Moon with the beautifulSinus Iridum  --  Bay of Rainbows  --  in the foreground . Loomingmonstrously above the lunar horizon was the thin crescent of Earth , embracing the darkened nightside of the planet . Beyond that blazed the sun , the streamers of the corona reaching out into space for millions of kilometers around it . It was a striking composition  --  and a glimpse of the future that even then lay only three years ahead . On the flight of Apollo 8 , Anders , Borman , and Lovell were to see this splendid sight with their unaided eyes , as they watched Earth rise above the farside on Christmas Day , 1968 . Heywood Floyd admired the painting , but he also regarded it with mixed feelings . He could not forget that it was older than everybody else on the ship  --  with one exception . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted it. 13 . THE WORLDS OF GALILEOEVEN NOW , MORE THAN THREE DECADES AFTER THE REVELATIONSof the first Voyager flybys , no one really understood why the four giant satellites differed so wildly from one another . They were all about the same size , and in the same part of the Solar System  --  yet they were totally dissimilar , as if children of a differentbirth . Only Callisto , the outermost , had turned out to be much as expected . When Leonov raced past at a distance of just over 100,000 kilometers , the larger of its countless craters were clearly visible to the naked eye . Through the telescope , the satellitelooked like a glass ball that had been used as a target by high-powered rifles ; it was completely covered with craters of every size , right down to the lower limit of visibility . Callisto , someone had once remarked , looked more like Earth 's Moon than did the Moon itself. * 77ARTHUR C. CLARKE * 78 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 79Nor was this particularly surprising . One would have expecteda world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to have been bombarded with the debris left over from the creation of the Solar System . Yet Ganymede , the satellite next door , had a totally different appearance . Though it had been well pepperedwith impact craters in the remote past , most of them had been ploughed over  --  a phrase that seemed peculiarly appropriate . Huge areas of Ganymede were covered with ridges and furrows , as if some cosmic gardener had dragged a giant rake across them . And there were light-colored streaks , like trails that might have been made by slugs fifty kilometers across . Most mysteriousof all were long , meandering bands , containing dozens of parallel lines . It was Nikolai Ternovsky who decided what they must be  --  multilane superhighways , laid out by drunken surveyors . He even claimed to have detected overpasses and cloverleaf intersections . Leonov had added some trillions of bits of information about Ganymede to the store of human knowledge , before it crossed the orbit of Europa . That icebound world , with its derelict and its dead , was on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's thoughts . Back on Earth , Dr. Chang was already a hero and his countrymenhad , with obvious embarrassment , acknowledged countlessmessages of sympathy . One had been sent in the name of Leonov 's crew  --  after , Floyd gathered , considerable redrafting in Moscow . The feeling on board the ship was ambiguous  --  a mixture of admiration , regret , and relief . All astronauts , irrespective of their national origins , regarded themselves as citizens of space and felt a common bond , sharing each other 's triumphs and tragedies . No one on Leonov was happy because the Chineseexpedition had met with disaster ; yet at the same time , there was a muted sense of relief that the race had not gone to the swiftest . The unexpected discovery of life on Europa had added a new element to the situation  --  one that was now being argued at great length both on Earth and aboard Leonov . Some exobiologists cried " I told you so ! , " pointing out that it should not have beensuch a surprise after all . As far back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange marine creatures thriving precariously in an environment thought to be equally hostile to life  --  the trenches on the bed of the Pacific . Volcanic springs , fertilizing and warming the abyss , had created oases in the deserts of the deep . Anything that had happened once on Earth should be expectedmillions of times elsewhere in the Universe ; that was almostan article of faith among scientists . Water  --  or at least ice  --  occurred on all the moons of Jupiter . And there were continuouslyerupting volcanoes on Io  --  so it was reasonable to expect weaker activity on the world next door . Putting these two facts together made Europan life seem not only possible , but inevitable  --  asmost of nature 's surprises are , when viewed with 20/20 hindsight . Yet that conclusion raised another question , and one vital to Leonov 's mission . Now that life had been discovered on the moons of Jupiter  --  did it have any connection with the Tycho monolith , and the still more mysterious artifact in orbit near Io ? That was a favorite subject to debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the creature encountered by Dr. Chang did not represent a high form of intelligence  --  at least , if his interpretation of its behavior was correct . No animal with even elementary powers of reasoning would have allowed itself to become a victim of its instincts , attracted like a moth to the candle until it risked destruction . Vasili Orlov was quick to give a counterexample that weakened , if it did not refute , that argument . " Look at whales and dolphins , " he said . " We call them intelligent  --  but how often they kill themselves in mass strandings ! That looks like a case where instinct overpowers reason . " " No need to go to the dolphins , " interjected Max Brailovsky . " One of the brightest engineers in my class was fatally attracted to a blonde in Kiev . When I heard of him last , he was working in a garage . And he 'd won a gold medal for designing spacestations . What a waste ! " Even if Dr. Chang 's Europan was intelligent , that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * 81not rule out higher forms elsewhere . The biology of a whole world could not be judged from a single specimen . But it had been widely argued that advanced intelligence could never arise in the sea ; there were not enough challenges in so benign and unvarying an environment . Above all , how could marine creatures ever develop a technology without the aid of fire ? Yet perhaps even that was possible ; the route that humanity had taken was not the only one . There might be whole civilizationsin the seas of other worlds . Still , it seemed unlikely that a space-faring culture could have arisen on Europa without leaving unmistakable signs of its existencein the form of buildings , scientific installations , launching sites , or other artifacts . But from pole to pole , nothing could be seen but level ice and a few outcroppings of bare rock . No time remained for speculations and discussions when Leonov hurtled past the orbits of Io and tiny Mimas . The crew was busy almost nonstop , preparing for the encounter and the brief onset of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be secured before the ship entered Jupiter 's atmosphere , and the drag of deceleration produced momentary peaks that might be as high as two gravities . Floyd was lucky ; he alone had time to admire the superb spectacle of the approaching planet , now filling almost half the sky . Because there was nothing to give it scale , there was no way that the mind could grasp its real size . He had to keep telling himself that fifty Earths would not cover the hemisphere now turned toward him . The clouds , colorful as the most garish sunset on Earth , raced so swiftly that he could see appreciable movement in as little as ten minutes . Great eddies were continually forming along the dozen or so bands that girdled the planet , then rippling away like swirls of smoke . Plumes of white gas occasionally geysered up from the depths , to be swept away by the gales caused by the planet 's tremendous spin . And perhaps strangest of all were the white spots , sometimes spaced as regularly as pearls on a necklace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jovian latitudes . In the hours immediately before encounter , Floyd saw little of captain or navigator . The Orlovs scarcely left the bridge , as they continually checked the approach orbit and made minute refinementsto Leonov 's course . The ship was now on the critical path that would just graze the outer atmosphere ; if it went too high , frictional braking would not be sufficient to slow it down , and it would go racing out of the Solar System , beyond all possibility of rescue . If it went too low , it would burn up like a meteor . Between the two extremes lay little margin for error . The Chinese had proved that aerobraking could be done , but there was always the chance that something would go wrong . So Floyd was not at all surprised when Surgeon  --  Commander Rudenko admitted , just an hour before contact : " I 'm beginning to wish , Woody , that I had brought along that icon , after all .

' Our great-great-grandfathers loved that kind of sentimental melodrama . " It shows the deck of a windjammer in a hurricane  --  the sails have been ripped away and the deck 's awash . In the background , the crew is struggling to save the ship . And in the foreground , a young sailor boy 's writing a note , while beside him is the bottle he hopes will carry it to land .

" He held out his hand . " If we do meet again  --  why , we shall smile . If not , why then this parting was well made . " Floyd blinked . " Shakespeare , I suppose ? " " Of course ; Brutus and Cassius before battle . See you later . " Tanya and Vasili were too intent upon their situation displays to do more than wave to Floyd , and he retreated to his cabin . He had already said farewell to the rest of the crew ; there was nothing to do but wait . His sleeping bag was slung in preparation for the return of gravity when deceleration commenced , and he had only to climb into it " Antennas retracted , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We should feel first braking in five minutes .

" To his astonishment , it was Zenia . " Do you mind if I come in ? " she asked awkwardly , in a smallgirlvoice which Floyd could scarcely recognize . " Of course not . But why are n't you in your own cubicle ? It 's only five minutes to reentry . " Even as he asked the question , he was aware of its foolishness . The answer was so perfectly obvious that Zenia did not deign to reply . But Zenia was the very last person he would have expected : her attitude toward him had invariably been polite but distant .

But my accommodation is somewhat limited . One might even call it Spartan . " She managed a faint smile , but said nothing as she floated into the room . For the first time , Floyd realized that she was not merely nervous  --  she was terrified . Then he understood why she had come to him . She was ashamed to face her countrymen and was looking for support elsewhere . With this realization , his pleasure at the unexpected encounterabated somewhat . That did not lessen his responsibility to another lonely human being , a long way from home . The fact that she was an attractive  --  though certainly not beautiful  --  woman of barely half his own age should not have affected the issue . But it did ; he was beginning to rise to the occasion . She must have noticed , but did nothing to encourage or discouragehim as they lay down side by side in the sleeping cocoon . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to do some anxious calculations . Suppose maximum gee was higher than predicted , and the suspension gave way ? They could easily be killed .. . There was an ample safety margin ; no need to worry about such an ignominious end . Humor was the enemy of desire ; theirembrace was now completely chaste . He was not sure whether to be glad or sorry . And it was too late for second thoughts . From far , far away came the first faint whisper of sound , like the wailing of some lost soul . At the same moment , the ship gave a barely perceptiblejerk ; the cocoon began to swing around and its suspension tightened . After weeks of weightlessness , gravity was returning . Within seconds , the faint wail had risen to a steady roar , and the cocoon had become an overloaded hammock . This is not such a good idea , Floyd thought to himself ; already it was difficult to breathe . The deceleration was only a part of the problem : Zenia was clutching him as a drowning person is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as gently as he could . " It 's all right , Zenia . If Tsien did it , so can we . Relax  --  do n't worry . It was difficult to shout tenderly , and he was not even sure if Zenia heard him above the roar of incandescent hydrogen . But she was no longer clutching him quite so desperately , and he seized the opportunity of taking a few deep breaths . What would Caroline think if she could see him now ? Would he tell her if he ever had the chance ? He was not sure she would understand . At a moment like this , all links with Earth seemed very tenuous indeed . It was impossible to move , or to speak , but now that he had grown accustomed to the strange sense of weight he was no longer uncomfortable  --  except for the increasing numbness in his right arm . With some difficulty , he managed to extricate it from beneath Zenia ; the familiar act brought a fleeting sense of guilt . As he felt his circulation returning , Floyd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronauts and cosmonauts : " Both the pleasures and problems of zero-gravity sex have been greatly exaggerated . " He wondered how the rest of the crew was faring , and he gave a momentary thought to Chandra and Curnow , sleeping peacefullythrough it all . They would never know if Leonov became a meteor shower in the Jovian sky . He did not envy them ; they had missed the experience of a lifetime . ARTHUR C. CLARKE * 86 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 87 ... And then he was falling . . . falling . . . falling . . . it was all over . The ship was back in space , where it belonged . And he and Zenia were floating apart . They would never again be so close together , but they would always know a special tenderness toward each other , which no one else could ever share . Tanya was speaking over the intercom ; her words were lost in the roar , but her voice sounded calm and perfectly normal , just as if she was making a routine announcement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonished to see that they were already at the midpoint of the braking maneuver . At that very moment , Leonov was at its closest approach to Jupiter ; only ex- pendable automatic probes had gone deeper into the Jovian atmosphere . " Halfway through , Zenia , " he shouted . " On the way out again . " He could not tell if she understood . Her eyes were tightly closed , but she smiled slightly . The ship was now rocking noticeably , like a small boat in a choppy sea . Was that normal ? wondered Floyd . He was glad that he had Zenia to worry about ; it took his mind away from his own fears . Just for a moment , before he managed to expel the thought , he had a vision of the walls suddenly glowing cherry red , and caving in upon him . Like the nightmare fantasy of Edgar Allan Poe 's " The Pit and the Pendulum , " which he 'd for- gotten for thirty years .. . But that would never happen . If the heat shield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a solid wall of gas . There would be no pain ; his nervous system would not have time to react before it ceased to exist . He had experienced more consoling thoughts , but this one was not to be despised . The buffeting slowly weakened . There was another inaudible announcement from Tanya ( he would pull her leg about that , when it was all over ) . Now time seemed to be going much more slowly ; after a while he stopped looking at his watch , because he could not believe it . The digits changed so slowly that he could almost imagine himself in some Einsteinian time dilation . And then something even more unbelievable happened . First he was amused , then slightly indignant . Zenia had fallen asleep  --  if not exactly in his arms , then at least beside them . It was a natural reaction : the strain must have exhausted her , and the wisdom of the body had come to her rescue . And sud- denly Floyd himself became aware of an almost postorgasmic drowsiness , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had to fight to remain awake . . . 15 . ESCAPE FROM THE GIANTWHEN FLOYD REACHED THE OBSERVATION DECK-A DISCREET FEWminutes after Zenia  --  Jupiter already seemed farther away . But that must be an illusion based on his knowledge , not the evidence of his eyes . They had barely emerged from the Jovian atmosphere , and the planet still filled half the sky . And now they were  --  as intended  --  its prisoners . During the last incandescent hour , they had deliberately jettisoned the excessspeed that could have carried them right out of the Solar System , and on to the stars . Now they were traveling in an ellipse  --  aclassical Hohmann orbit  --  which would shuttle them back between Jupiter and the orbit of Io , 350,000 kilometers higher . If they did not  --  or could not  --  fire their motors again , Leonov would swing back and forth between these limits , completingone revolution every nineteen hours . It would become the closest of Jupiter 's moons  --  though not for long . Each time it 882010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 89grazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into destruction . Floyd had never really enjoyed vodka , but he joined the oth- ers without any reservations in drinking a triumphant toast to the ship 's designers , coupled with a vote of thanks to Sir Isaac Newton . Then Tanya put the bottle firmly back in its cupboard ; there was still much to be done . Though they were all expecting it , everyone jumped at the sudden muffled thud of explosive charges , and the jolt of separa- tion . A few seconds later , a large , still-glowing disk floated into view , slowly turning end-over-end as it drifted away from the ship . " Look ! " cried Max . " A flying saucer ! Who 's got a camera ? " There was a distinct note of hysterical relief in the laughter that followed . It was interrupted by the captain , in a more se- rious vein . " Good-bye , faithful heat shield ! You did a wonderful job . " " But what a waste ! " said Sasha . " There 's at least a couple of tons left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried ! " " If that 's good , conservative Russian engineering , " retorted Floyd , " then I 'm all for it . Far better a few tons too much  --  than one milligram too little . " Everyone applauded those noble sentiments as the jettisoned shield cooled to yellow , then red , and finally became as black as the space around it . It vanished from sight while only a few kilometers away , though occasionally the sudden reappearance of an eclipsed star would betray its presence . " Preliminary orbit check completed , " said Vasili . " We 're within ten meters a second of our right vector . Not bad for a first try . " There was a subdued sigh of relief at the news , and a few minutes later Vasili made another announcement . " Changing attitude for course correction ; delta vee six meters a second . Twenty-second burn coming up in one minute . " They were still so close to Jupiter it was impossible to believe that the ship was orbiting the planet ; they might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea of clouds . ARTHUR C. CLARKE * 90There was no sense of scale ; it was easy to imagine that they were speeding away from some terrestrial sunset ; the reds and pinks and crimsons sliding below were so familiar . And that was an illusion ; nothing here had any parallels with Earth . Those colors were intrinsic , not borrowed from the setting sun . The very gases were utterly alien  --  methane and ammonia and a witch 's brew of hydrocarbons , stirred in a hydrogen-heliumcauldron . Not one trace of free oxygen , the breath of human life . The clouds marched from horizon to horizon in parallel rows , distorted by occasional swirls and eddies . Here and there upwellingsof brighter gas broke the pattern , and Floyd could also see the dark rim of a great whirlpool , a maelstrom of gas leading down into unfathomable Jovian depths . He began to look for the Great Red Spot , then quickly checked himself at such a foolish thought . All the enormous cloudscape he could see below would be only a few percent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recognize the shape of the United States from a small airplane flying low above Kansas . " Correction completed . We 're now on interception orbit with Io . Arrival time : eight hours , fifty-five minutes . " Less than nine hours to climb up from Jupiter and meet whateveris waiting for us , thought Floyd . We 've escaped from the giant  --  but he represents a danger we understood , and could preparefor . What lies ahead now is utter mystery . And when we have survived that challenge , we must return to Jupiter once again . We shall need his strength to send us safely home. 16 . PRIVATE LINE " . . . HELLO , DIMITRI .

But you wo n't get any help from me , even though I 'm the world 's  --  sorry , Solar System 's  --  leading expert on the painless removal of elderly scientists . " Would you believe that I 'm still slightly drunk ? We felt we*91ARTHUR C. CLARKE * 92 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 93deserved a little party , once we 'd successfully rendez  --  rendezvous , damn , rendezvoused with Discovery . Besides , we had two new crew members to welcome aboard . Chandra does n't believe in alcohol  --  it makes you too human  --  but Walter Curnow more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sober , just as you 'd expect . " My fellow Americans  --  I sound like a politician , God help me  --  came out of hibernation without any problems , and are both looking forward to starting work . We 'll all have to move quickly ; not only is time running out , but Discovery seems to be in very bad shape . We could hardly believe our eyes when we saw how its spotless white hull had turned a sickly yellow . " Io 's to blame , of course . The ship 's spiraled down to within three thousand kilometers , and every few days one of the volcanoesblasts a few megatons of sulfur up into the sky . Even though you 've seen the movies , you ca n't really imagine what it 's like to hang above that inferno ; I 'll be glad when we can get away , even though we 'll be heading for something much more mysterious  --  and perhaps far more dangerous . " I flew over Kilauea during the ' 06 eruption ; that was mighty scary , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the moment , we 're over the nightside , and that makes it worse . You can see just enough to imagine a lot more . It 's as close to Hell as I ever want to get .. . " Some of the sulfur lakes are hot enough to glow , but most of the light comes from electrical discharges . Every few minutes the whole landscape seems to explode , as if a giant photoflash has gone off above it . And that 's probably not a bad analogy ; there are millions of amps flowing in the flux-tube linking Io and Jupiter , and every so often there 's a breakdown . Then you get the biggest lightning flash in the Solar System , and half our circuit-breakers jump out in sympathy . " There 's just been an eruption right on the terminator , and I can see a huge cloud expanding up toward us , climbing into the sunlight . I doubt if it will reach our altitude , and even if it does it will be harmless by the time it gets here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to devour us . " Soon after we got here , I realized that Io reminded me ofsomething ; it took me a couple of days to work it out , and then I had to check with Mission Archives because the ship 's library could n't help  --  shame on it . Do you remember how I introduced you to The Lord of the Rings , when we were kids back at that Oxford conference ? Well , Io is Mordor : Look up Part Three . There 's a passage about rivers of molten rock that wound their way . . . until they cooled and lay like twisted dragon-shapes vomited from the tormented earth . ' That 's a perfect description : how did Tolkien know , a quarter century before anyone ever saw a picture of Io ? Talk about Nature imitating Art . " At least we wo n't have to land there : I do n't think that even our late Chinese colleagues would have attempted that . But perhapsone day it may be possible ; there are areas that seem fairly stable , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have believed that we 'd come all the way to Jupiter , greatest of planets  --  and then ignore it . Yet that 's what we 're doing most of the time ; and when we 're not looking at Io or Discovery , we 're thinking about the . . . Artifact . " It 's still ten thousand kilometers away , up there at the librationpoint , but when I look at it through the main telescope it seems close enough to touch . Because it 's so completely featureless , there 's no indication of size , no way the eye can judge it 's really a couple of kilometers long . If it 's solid , it must weigh billions of tons . " But is it solid ? It gives almost no radar echo , even when it 's square-on to us . We can see it only as a black silhouette against the clouds of Jupiter , three hundred thousand kilometers below . Apart from its size , it looks exactly like the monolith we dug up on the Moon . " Well , tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know when I 'll have time or opportunity to speak to you again . But there 's one more thing , old friend , before I sign off . " It 's Caroline . She 's never really understood why I had to leave Earth , and in a way I do n't think she 'll ever quite forgive me . Some women believe that love is n't the only thing  --  but everything . Perhaps they 're right . . . Anyway , it 's certainly too late to argue now . ARTHUR C. CLARKE *94 " Try and cheer her up when you have a chance . She talks about going back to the mainland . I 'm afraid that if she does .. . " If you ca n't get through to her , try to cheer up Chris . I miss him more than I care to say . " He 'll believe Uncle Dimitri  --  if you say that his father still loves him , and will be coming home just as quickly as he can . " 17 . BOARDING PARTYEVEN IN THE BEST OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncooperative spaceship . Indeed , it can be positively dangerous . Walter Curnow knew that as an abstract principle ; but he did not really feel it in his bones until he saw the entire hundredmeterlength of Discovery turning end-over-end , while Leonov kept at a safe distance . Years ago , friction had braked the spin of Discovery 's carousel , thus transferring its angular momentum to the rest of the structure . Now , like a drum majorette 's baton at the height of its trajectory , the abandoned ship was slowly tumblingalong its orbit . The first problem was to stop that spin , which made Discovery not only uncontrollable but almost unapproachable . As he suited up in the airlock with Max Brailovsky , Curnow had a very rare sensation of incompetence , even inferiority ; it was not his line of business . He had already explained gloomily , * 95ARTHUR C. CLARKE * 96 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 97 " I 'm a space engineer , not a space monkey " ; but the job had to be done . He alone possessed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max and his colleagues , working with unfamiliarcircuit diagrams and equipment , would take far too long . By the time they had restored power to the ship and masteredits controls , it would have plunged into the sulfurous firepitsbelow . " You 're not scared , are you ? " asked Max , when they were about to put on their helmets . " Not enough to make a mess in my suit . Otherwise , yes . " Max chuckled . " I 'd say that 's about right for this job . But do n't worry  --  I 'll get you there in one piece , with my  --  what do you call it ? " " Broomstick . Because witches are supposed to ride them . " " Oh yes . Have you ever used one ? " " I tried once , but mine got away from me . Everyone else thought it was very funny . " There are some professions which have evolved unique and characteristic tools  --  the longshoreman 's hook , the potter 's wheel , the bricklayer 's trowel , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of their time on zero-gravity constructionprojects had developed the broomstick . It was very simple  --  a hollow tube just a meter long , with a footpad at one end and a retaining loop at the other . At the touch of a button , it could telescope out to five or six times its normal length , and the internal shock-absorbing system allowed a skilled operator to perform the most amazing maneuvers . The footpad could also become a claw or hook if necessary ; there were many other refinements , but that was the basic design . It looked deceptively easy to use ; it was n't . The airlock pumps finished recycling ; the EXIT sign came on ; the outer doors opened , and they drifted slowly into the void . Discovery was windmilling about two hundred meters away , following them in orbit around Io , which filled half the sky . Jupiter was invisible , on the other side of the satellite . This was a matter of deliberate choice ; they were using Io as a shield to protect them from the energies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worlds . Even so , the radiation level wasdangerously high ; they had less than fifteen minutes before they must get back to shelter . Almost immediately , Curnow had a problem with his suit . " It fitted me when I left Earth , " he complained . " But now I 'm rattlingaround inside like a pea in a pod . " " That 's perfectly normal , Walter , " said Surgeon  --  Commander Rudenko , breaking into the radio circuit . " You lost ten kilos in hibernation , which you could very well afford to miss . And you 've already put three of them back . " Before Curnow had time to think of a suitable retort , he found himself gently but firmly jerked away from Leonov . " Just relax , Walter , " said Brailovsky . " Do n't use your thrusters , even if you start tumbling . Let me do all the work . " Curnow could see the faint puffs from the younger man 's backpack , as its tiny jets drove them toward Discovery . With each little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towline , and he would start moving toward Brailovsky ; but he never caught up with him before the next puff came . He felt rather like a yo-yo  --  now making one of its periodic comebacks on Earth  --  bouncing up and down on its string . There was only one safe way to approach the derelict , and that was along the axis around which it was slowly revolving . Discovery 's center of rotation was approximately amidships , near the main antenna complex , and Brailovsky was heading directlytoward this area , with his anxious partner in tow . How will he stop both of us in time ? Curnow asked himself . Discovery was now a huge , slender dumbbell slowly flailing the entire sky ahead of them . Though it took several minutes to complete one revolution , the far ends were moving at an impressivespeed . Curnow tried to ignore them , and concentrated on the approaching  --  and immobile  --  center . " I 'm aiming for that , " said Brailovsky . " Do n't try to help , and do n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does he mean by that ? Curnow asked himself , while preparing to be as unsurprised as possible . Everything happened in about five seconds . Brailovsky triggeredhis broomstick , so that it telescoped out to its full length of four meters and made contact with the approaching ship . TheARTHUR C. CLARKE * 98 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 99broomstick started to collapse , its internal spring absorbing Brailovsky 's considerable momentum ; but it did not , as Curnow had fully expected , bring him to rest beside the antenna mount . It immediately expanded again , reversing the Russian 's velocity so that he was , in effect , reflected away from Discovery just as rapidly as he had approached . He flashed past Curnow , heading out into space again , only a few centimeters away . The startled American just had time to glimpse a large grin before Brailovsky shot past him . A second later , there was a jerk on the line connecting them , and a quick surge of deceleration as they shared momentum . Their opposing velocities had been neatly canceled ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curnow had merely to reach out to the nearest handhold , and drag them both in . " Have you ever tried Russian roulette ? " he asked , when he had got his breath back . " No  --  what is it ? " " I must teach you sometime . It 's almost as good as this , for curing boredom . " " I hope you 're not suggesting , Walter , that Max would do anythingdangerous ? " Dr. Rudenko sounded as if she was genuinely shocked , and Curnow decided it was best not to answer ; sometimes the Russiansdid not understand his peculiar sense of humor . " You could have fooled me , " he muttered under his breath , not loud enough for her to hear . Now that they were firmly attached to the hub of the windmillingship , he was no longer conscious of its rotation  --  especiallywhen he fixed his gaze upon the metal plates immediatelybefore his eyes . The ladder stretching away into the distance , running along the slender cylinder that was Discovery 's main structure , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end seemed several light-years away , though he knew perfectly well that the distance was only fifty meters . " I 'll go first , " said Brailovsky , reeling in the slack on the line linking them together . " Remember  --  it 's downhill all the way from here . But that 's no problem  --  you can hold on with onehand . Even at the bottom , gravity 's only about a tenth gee . And that 's  --  what do you say ?  --  chickenshit . " " I think you mean chickenfeed . And if it 's all the same to you , I 'm going feet first . I never liked crawling down ladders the wrong way up  --  even in fractional gravity . " It was essential , Curnow was very well aware , to keep up this gently bantering tone ; otherwise he would be simply overwhelmedby the mystery and danger of the situation . There he was , almost a billion kilometers from home , about to enter the most famous derelict in the entire history of space exploration ; a media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that was not a bad analogy . But there was also much that made his situation unique ; even if he tried to ignore the nightmare moonscape filling half the sky , there was a constant reminder of its presence at hand . Every time he touched the rungs of the ladder , his glove dislodged a thin mist of sulfur dust . Brailovsky , of course , was quite correct ; the rotational gravity caused by the ship 's end-over-end tumbling was easily countered . As he grew used to it , Curnow even welcomed the sense of direction it gave him . And then , quite suddenly , they had reached the big , discoloredsphere of Discovery 's control and life-support module . Only a few meters away was an emergency hatch  --  the very one , Curnow realized , that Bowman had entered for his final confrontation with Hal . " Hope we can get in , " muttered Brailovsky . " Pity to come all this way and find the door locked . " He scraped away the sulfur obscuring the AIRLOCK STATUS displaypanel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Wo n't do any harm  --  but nothing will happen . " " You 're right . Well , here goes with manual ... " It was fascinating to watch the narrow hairline open in the curved wall , and to note the little puff of vapor dispersing into space , carrying with it a scrap of paper . Was that some vital message ? They would never know ; it spun away , tumbling endARTHUR C. CLARKE * 100over end without losing any of its initial spin as it disappeared against the stars . Brailovsky kept turning the manual control for what seemed a very long time , before the dark , uninviting cave of the airlock was completely open . Curnow had hoped that the emergency lights , at least , might still be operating . No such luck . " You 're boss now , Walter . Welcome to U.S. territory . " It certainly did not look very welcoming as he clambered inside , flashing the beam of his helmet light around the interior . As far as Curnow could tell , everything was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked himself , half angrily . Closing the door manually took even longer than opening it , but there was no alternative until the ship was powered up again . Just before the hatch was sealed , Curnow risked a glance at the insane panorama outside . A flickering blue lake had opened up near the equator ; he was sure it had not been there a few hours earlier . Brilliant yellow flares , the characteristic color of glowing sodium , were dancing along its edges ; and the whole of the nightland was veiled in the ghostly plasma discharge of one of Io 's almost continuous auroras . It was the stuff of future nightmares  --  and as if that was not sufficient , there was one further touch worthy of a mad surrealistartist . Stabbing up into the black sky , apparently emerging directly from the firepits of the burning moon , was an immense , curving horn , such as a doomed bullfighter might have glimpsed in the final moment of truth . The crescent of Jupiter was rising to greet Discovery and Leonov as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MOMENT THAT THE OUTER HATCH HAD CLOSED BEHIND THEM , there had been a subtle reversal of roles . Curnow was at home now , while Brailovsky was out of his element , feeling ill at ease in the labyrinth of pitch-black corridors and tunnels that was Discovery 's interior . In theory , Max knew his way around the ship , but that knowledge was based only on a study of its design drawings . Curnow , on the other hand , had spent months working in Discovery 's still uncompleted identical twin ; he could , quite literally , find his way around blindfolded . Progress was made difficult because this part of the ship was designed for zero gee ; now the uncontrolled spin provided an artificial gravity , which , slight though it was , always seemed to be in the most inconvenient direction . " First thing we 've got to do , " muttered Curnow , after sliding several meters down a corridor before he could grab a handhold , " is to stop this damned spin . And we ca n't do that until we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * 103power . I only hope that Dave Bowman safeguarded all systems before he abandoned ship . " " Are you sure he did abandon the ship ? He may have intended to come back . " " You may be right ; I do n't suppose we 'll ever know . If he even knew himself . " They had now entered the Pod Bay  --  Discovery 's " space garage , " which normally contained three of the spherical onemanmodules used for activities outside the ship . Only Pod Number 3 remained ; Number 1 had been lost in the mysterious accident that had killed Frank Poole  --  and Number 2 was with Dave Bowman , wherever he might be . The Pod Bay also contained two spacesuits , looking uncomfortablylike decapitated corpses as they hung helmetless in their racks . It needed very little effort of the imagination  --  and Brailovsky 's was now working overtime  --  to fill them with a whole menagerie of sinister occupants . It was unfortunate , but not altogether surprising , that Curnow'ssometimes irresponsible sense of humor got the better of him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a tone of deadly seriousness , " whatever happens  --  please do n't go chasing off after the ship 's cat . " For a few milliseconds , Brailovsky was thrown off guard ; he almost answered : " I do wish you had n't said that , Walter , " but checked himself in time . That would have been too damning an admission of weakness ; instead he replied , " I 'd like to meet the idiot who put that movie in our library . " " Katerina probably did it , to test everyone 's psychological balance . Anyway , you laughed your head off when we screened it last week . " Brailovsky was silent ; Curnow 's remark was perfectly true . But that had been back in the familiar warmth and light of Leonov , among his friends  --  not in a pitch-black , freezing derelict , haunted by ghosts . No matter how rational one was , it was all too easy to imagine some implacable alien beast prowling these corridors , seeking whom it might devour .

If I close my eyes , I can still see the hut of the Baba Yaga , standing in that forest clearing on its scrawny chicken legs .. . Enough of this nonsense . I 'm a brilliant young engineer faced with the biggest technical challenge of his life , and I must n't let my American friend know that I 'm sometimes a frightened little boy ... The noises did not help . There were too many of them , though they were so faint that only an experienced astronaut would have detected them against the sounds of his own suit . But to Max Brailovsky , accustomed to working in an environment of utter silence , they were distinctly unnerving , even though he knew that the occasional cracklings and creakings were almost certainly caused by thermal expansion as the ship turned like a roast on a spit . Feeble though the sun was out here , there was still an appreciable temperature change between light and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was pressure outside as well as in . All the forces acting on its joints were subtly altered , and he could no longer judge his movementsaccurately . I 'm a beginner , starting my training all over again , he told himself angrily .

" " A nice bracing Russian winter . Anyway , the air in my suit will keep out the worst of the cold . " " Well , go ahead . But let me shine my light on your face , so I can see if you start to turn blue . And keep talking . " Brailovsky unsealed his visor and swung the faceplate upward . He flinched momentarily as icy fingers seemed to caress his cheeks , then took a cautious sniff , followed by a deeper breath . " Chilly  --  but my lungs are n't freezing . There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if something 's  --  oh no ! " Looking suddenly pale , Brailovsky quickly snapped the faceplateshut . ARTHUR C. CLARKE * 104 " What 's the trouble , Max ? " Curnow asked with sudden and now perfectly genuine anxiety . Brailovsky did not reply ; he looked as if he was still trying to regain control of himself . Indeed , he seemed in real danger of that always horrible and sometimes fatal disaster  --  vomiting in a spacesuit . There was a long silence ; then Curnow said reassuringly : " I get it . But I 'm sure you 're wrong . We know that Poole was lost in space . Bowman reported that he . . . ejected the others after they died in hibernation  --  and we can be sure that he did . There ca n't be anyone here . Besides , it 's so cold . " He almost added " like a morgue " but checked himself in time . " But suppose , " whispered Brailovsky , " just suppose Bowman managed to get back to the ship  --  and died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curnow deliberately and slowly opened his own faceplate . He winced as the freezing air bit into his lungs , then wrinkled his nose in disgust . " I see what you mean . But you 're letting your imagination run away with you .

We 've got a job to do , Max . If Dave Bowman'sstill here , that 's not our department  --  is it , Katerina ?

OPERATION WINDMILLWHEN DISCOVERY SUDDENLY LIT UP LIKE THE PROVERBIAL CHRISTmastree , navigation and interior lights blazing from end to end , the cheer aboard Leonov might almost have been heard across the vacuum between the two ships . It turned into an ironic groan when the lights promptly went out again . Nothing else happened for half an hour ; then the observation windows of Discovery 's flight deck began to glow with the soft crimson of the emergency lights . A few minutes later , Curnow and Brailovsky could be seen moving around inside , their figuresblurred by the film of sulfur dust . " Hello , Max  --  Walter  --  can you hear us ? " called Tanya Orlova . Both the figures waved instantly , but made no other reply . Obviously , they were too busy to engage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait patiently while various lights flashed on and off , one of the three Pod Bay doors slowly* 105ARTHUR C. CLARKE* 106 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 107 " Agreed . We 'll cross that bridge when we come to it . I 'll re- port again as soon as I can . " No one had much rest for the next two days . By the end of that time , Curnow and Brailovsky had practically fallen asleep in their suits , but had completed their survey of Discovery and found no unpleasant surprises . Both the Space Agency and the State Department were relieved by the preliminary report ; it al- lowed them to claim , with some justification , that Discovery was not a derelict but a " temporarily decommissioned United States Spacecraft . " Now the task of reconditioning had to begin . Once power had been restored , the next problem was the air ; even the most thorough housecleaning operations had failed to remove the stink . Curnow had been right in identifying its source as food spoiled when refrigeration had failed ; he also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romantic . " I 've only got to close my eyes , " he asserted , " and I feel I 'm back on an old-time whaling ship . Can you imagine what the Pequod must have smelled like ? " It was unanimously agreed that , after a visit to Discovery , very little effort of the imagination was required . The problem was finally solved  --  or at least reduced to manageable proportions  --  by dumping the ship 's atmosphere . Fortunately , there was still enough air in the reserve tanks to replace it . One piece of very welcome news was that ninety percent of the propellant needed for the return journey was still available ; choosing ammonia instead of hydrogen as working fluid for the plasma drive had paid off handsomely . The more efficient hy- drogen would have boiled off into space years ago , despite the insulation of the tanks and the frigid temperature outside . But almost all the ammonia had remained safely liquefied , and there was enough to get the ship back to a safe orbit around the Earth . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spin was perhaps the most critical step in getting the ship under control . Sasha Kovalev compared Curnow and Brailovsky to Don Quixote and Sancho Panza , and expressed the hope that their windmill-tilting expe- dition would end more successfully. opened and quickly closed , and the main antenna slewed around a modest ten degrees . " Hello , Leonov , " said Curnow at last . " Sorry to keep you waiting , but we 've been rather busy . " Here 's a quick assessment , judging from what we 've seen so far . The ship 's in much better shape than I feared . Hull 's intact , leakage negligible  --  air pressure eighty-five percent nominal . Quite breathable , but we 'll have to do a major recycling job because it stinks to high heaven . " The best news is that the power systems are okay . Main reactorstable , batteries in good shape .

But you know how that 's changed up  --  and down . " " Well , if we do n't run into any major snags , we can haul Discovery up to a stable orbit away from this hellhole  --  oh , I 'd say inside a week . " " Anything you need ? " " No  --  Max and I are doing fine . We 're going into the carousel now , to check the bearings . I want to get it running as soon as possible . " " Pardon me , Walter  --  but is that important ? Gravity 's convenient , but we 've managed without any for quite a while . " " I 'm not after gravity , though it will be useful to have some aboard . If we can get the carousel running again , it will mop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then we 'll be able to couple our airlocks together , and cut out EVAs . That will make work a hundred times easier . " " Nice idea , Walter  --  but you 're not going to mate my ship to that . . . windmill . Suppose the bearings seize up and the carouseljams ? That would tear us to pieces . " AARTHUR C. CLARKE * 108 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 109 Very cautiously , with many pauses for checking , power was fed to the carousel motors and the great drum was brought up to speed , reabsorbing the spin it had long ago imparted to the ship . Discovery executed a complex series of precessions , until even- tually its end-over-end tumble had almost vanished . The last traces of unwanted rotation were neutralized by the attitude- control jets , until the two ships were floating motionless side by side , the squat , stocky Leonov dwarfed by the long , slender Discovery . Transfer from one to the other was now safe and easy , but Captain Orlova still refused to permit a physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Io was coming steadily closer ; they might yet have to abandon the vessel they had worked so hard to save . The fact that they now knew the reason for Discovery 's myste- rious orbital decay did not help in the least . Every time the ship passed between Jupiter and Io , it sliced through the invisible flux-tube linking the two bodies  --  the electric river flowing from world to world . The resulting eddy currents induced in the ship were continually slowing it down , braking it once every revolution . There was no way to predict the final moment of impact , for the current in the flux-tube varied wildly according to Jupiter 's own inscrutable laws . Sometimes there were dramatic surges of activity accompanied by spectacular electric and auroral storms around Io . Then the ships would lose altitude by many kilome- ters , at the same time becoming uncomfortably hot before their thermal control systems could readjust . This unexpected effect had scared and surprised everyone be- fore the obvious explanation was realized . Any form of braking produces heat , somewhere ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned them briefly into low- powered electric furnaces . It was not surprising that some of Discovery 's food supply had been ruined during the years the ship had been alternately cooked and cooled . The festering landscape of Io , looking more than ever like an illustration from a medical textbook , was only five hundred kilo- meters away when Curnow risked activating the main drive , while Leonov stood off at a very respectful distance . There were no visible effects  --  none of the smoke and fire of the old-time chemical rockets  --  but the two ships drew slowly apart as Discovery gained speed . After a few hours of very gentle maneuvering , both ships had raised themselves a thousand kilometers ; now there was time to relax briefly , and to make plans for the next stage in the mission .

" Very casually , she broke a small capsule under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , annoyed and hungry. 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 11120 . GUILLOTINE " WHAT IS IT ? " ASKED CURNOW WITH MILD DISTASTE , HEFTING THE little mechanism in his hand . " A guillotine for mice ? " " Not a bad description  --  but I 'm after bigger game . " Floyd pointed to a flashing arrow on the display screen , which was now showing a complicated circuit diagram . " You see this line ? " " Yes  --  the main power supply . So ? " " This is the point where it enters Hal 's central processing unit . I 'd like you to install this gadget here . Inside the cable trunking , where it ca n't be found without a deliberate search . " " I see . A remote control , so you can pull the plug on Hal whenever you want to . Very neat  --  and a nonconducting blade , too , so there wo n't be any embarrassing shorts when it 's triggered . Who makes toys like this ? The CIA ? " " Never mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculatorI always keep on my desk . Put in nine nines , take the 110square root , and press INT . That 's all . I 'm not sure of its range  --  we 'll have to test that  --  but as long as Leonov and Discovery are within a couple of kilometers of each other , there 'll be no danger of Hal running amok again . " " Who are you going to tell about this . . . thing ? " " Well , the only person I 'm really hiding it from is Chandra . " " I guessed as much . " " But the fewer who know , the less likely it is to be talked about . I 'll tell Tanya that it exists , and if there 's an emergency you can show her how to operate it . " " What kind of emergency ? " " That 's not a very bright question , Walter . If I knew , I would n't need the damn thing . " " Guess you 're right . When do you want me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can . Preferably tonight , when Chandra 's sleeping . " " Are you kidding ? I do n't think he ever sleeps . He 's like a mother nursing a sick baby . " " Well , he 's got to come back to Leonov to eat , occasionally . " " I 've news for you . The last time he went across , he tied a little sack of rice to his suit . That will keep him going for weeks . " " Then we 'll have to use one of Katerina 's famous knockout drops . They did a pretty good job on you , did n't they ? " Curnow was joking about Chandra  --  at least , Floyd assumed that he was , though one could never be quite sure : he was fond of making outrageous statements with a perfectly straight face . It had been some time before the Russians had fully realized that ; soon , in self-defense , they were prone to preemptive laughs even when Curnow was being perfectly serious . Curnow 's own laugh , mercifully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upward-bound shuttle ; on that occasion , it had obviously been primed by alcohol . He had fully expected to cringe from it again at the end-of-orbit party , when Leonov had finally made rendezvous with Discovery . But even on that occasion , though Curnow had drunk a good deal , he had remained as much under control as Captain Orlova herself . The one thing he did take seriously was his work . On the way up from Earth , he had been a passenger . Now he was crew. 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 11321 . RESURRECTIONWE ARE , FLOYD TOLD HIMSELF , ABOUT TO AWAKEN A SLEEPINGgiant . How will Hal react to our presence , after all these years ? What will he remember of the past  --  and will he be friendly , or hostile ? As he floated just behind Dr. Chandra in the zero-gravity environmentof Discovery 's flight deck , Floyd 's mind was seldom far from the cutoff switch , installed and tested only a few hours earlier . The radio control was mere centimeters from his hand , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At this stage , Hal was still disconnected from all the ship 's operationalcircuits . Even if he was reactivated , he would be a brain without limbs , though not without sense organs . He would be able to communicate , but not to act . As Curnow had put it , " The worst he can do is swear at us . " " I 'm ready for the first test , Captain , " said Chandra . " All the missing modules have been replaced , and I 've run diagnostic* 112programs on all circuits . Everything appears normal , at least on this level . " Captain Orlova glanced at Floyd , who gave a nod . At Chandra 's insistence , only the three of them were present for this critical first run , and it was quite obvious that even this small audience was unwelcome . " Very well , Dr. Chandra . " Ever conscious of protocol , the captainadded quickly : " Dr. Floyd has given his approval , and I have no objections myself . " " I should explain , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that his voice-recognition and speech-synthesiscenters have been damaged . We 'll have to teach him to speak all over again . Luckily , he learns several million times faster than a human being . " The scientist 's fingers danced over the keyboard as he typed out a dozen words , apparently at random , carefully pronouncing each one as it appeared on the screen . Like a distorted echo , the words came back from the speaker grill  --  lifeless , indeed mechanical , with no sense of any intelligence behind them . This is n't the old Hal , thought Floyd . It 's no better than the primitive speaking toys that were such a novelty when I was a kid . Chandra pressed the REPEAT button , and the series of words sounded once again . Already , there was a noticeable improvement , though no one could have mistaken the speaker for a human being . " The words I gave him contain the basic English phonemes ; about ten iterations , and he 'll be acceptable . But I do n't have the equipment to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked Floyd . " You mean that he 's  --  well , brain-damaged ? " " No , " snapped Chandra . " The logic circuits are in perfect condition . Only the voice output may be defective , though it will improve steadily . So check everything against the visual display , to avoid misinterpretations . And when you do speak , enunciate carefully . " Floyd gave Captain Orlova a wry smile , and asked the obvious question . ARTHUR C. CLARKE * 114 " What about all the Russian accents around here ? " " I 'm sure that wo n't be a problem with Captain Orlova and Dr. Kovalev . But with the others  --  well , we 'll have to run individual tests . Anyone who ca n't pass will have to use the keyboard . " " That 's still looking a long way ahead . For the present , you 're the only person who should attempt communication . Agreed , Captain ? " " Absolutely . " Only the briefest of nods revealed that Dr. Chandra had heard them . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words and symbols flashed across the display screen at such a rate that no human being could possibly assimilate them . Presumably Chandra had an eidetic memory , for he appeared to recognize whole pages of information at a glance . Floyd and Orlov were just about to leave the scientist to his arcane devotions when he suddenly acknowledged their presenceagain , holding up his hand in warning or anticipation . With an almost hesitant movement , in marked contrast with his previous swift actions , he slid back a locking bar and pressed a single , isolated key . Instantly , with no perceptible pause , a voice came from the console , no longer in a mechanical parody of human speech . There was intelligence  --  consciousness  --  self-awareness here , though as yet only on a rudimentary level . " Good morning , Dr. Chandra . This is Hal . I am ready for my first lesson .

They suggest we call it Sputnik , which means companion as well as satellite .

Even Captain Tanya 's given up all pretense of a regular schedule ; each problem has to be fixed as it comes along , by whoever is on the spot . We sleep when we ca n't stay awake any longer .

" I do n't know who first gave it that name  --  the Russians , understandably , are n't keen on it . And they 've waxed quite sarcasticabout our official designation TMA-2 , pointing out to me  --  several times  --  that it 's the best part of a billion kilometers from Tycho . Also that Bowman reported no magnetic anomaly , and that the only resemblance to TMA-1 is the shape . When I asked them what name they preferred , they came up with Zagadka , which means enigma . It 's certainly an excellent name ; but everyonesmiles when I try to pronounce it , so I 'll stick to Big Brother . " Whatever you call the thing , it 's only ten thousand kilometersaway now , and the trip wo n't take more than a few hours . But that last lap has us all nervous , I do n't mind telling you .

I wonder why he never sent it ; obviously , he did expect  --  or hope  --  to return to the ship after that last EVA . Of course , we 've had it forwarded to Mrs. Bowman  --  she 's in a nursing home , somewhere in Florida , and her mental condition is poor , so it may not mean anything to her .

RENDEZVOUSNIKOLAI TERNOVSKY , LEONOV 'S CONTROL AND CYBERNETICS EXpert , was the only man aboard who could talk to Dr. Chandra on something like his own terms . Although Hal 's principal creator and mentor was reluctant to admit anyone into his full confidence , sheer physical exhaustion had forced him to accept help . Russian and Indo-American had formed a temporary alliance , which functioned surprisingly well . Most of the credit for this went to the good-natured Nikolai , who was somehow able to sense when Chandra really needed him , and when he preferred to be alone . The fact that Nikolai 's English was much the worst on the ship was totally unimportant , since most of the time both men spoke a computerese wholly unintelligible to anyone else . After a week 's slow and careful reintegration , all of Hal 's routine , supervisory functions were operating reliably . He was like a man who could walk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * 120 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 121jobs , and engage in low-level conversation . In human terms , he had an Intelligence Quotient of perhaps 50 ; only the faintest outlinesof his original personality had yet emerged . He was still sleepwalking ; nevertheless , in Chandra 's expert opinion he was now quite capable of flying Discovery from its close orbit around Io up to the rendezvous with Big Brother . The prospect of getting an extra seven thousand kilometers away from the burning hell beneath them was welcomed by everyone . Trivial though that distance was in astronomical terms , it meant that the sky would no longer be dominated by a landscapethat might have been imagined by Dante or Hieronymus Bosch . And although not even the most violent eruptions had blasted any material up to the ships , there was always the fear that to might attempt to set a new record . As it was , visibility from Leonov 's observation deck was steadily degraded by a thin film of sulfur , and sooner or later someone would have to go out and clean it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hal was given the first control of the ship . It was a very limited form of control ; he was merely repeating the program that had been fed into his memory , and monitoring its execution . And the humancrew was monitoring him : if any malfunction occurred , they would take over immediately . The first burn lasted for ten minutes ; then Hal reported that Discovery had entered the transfer orbit . As soon as Leonov 's radar and optical tracking confirmed that , the other ship injected itself into the same trajectory . Two minor in-course corrections were made ; then , three hours and fifteen minutes later , both arriveduneventfully at the first Lagrange point , L.1  --  10,500 kilometersup , on the invisible line connecting the centers of Io and Jupiter . Hal had behaved impeccably , and Chandra showed unmistakabletraces of such purely human emotions as satisfaction and even joy . But by that time , everyone 's thoughts were elsewhere ; Big Brother , alias Zagadka , was only a hundred kilometers away . Even from that distance , it already appeared larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnatural in itsstraight-edged , geometrical perfection . Against the background of space it would have been completely invisible , but the scuddingJovian clouds 350,000 kilometers below showed it up in dramatic relief . They also produced an illusion that , once experienced , the mind found almost impossible to refute . Because there was no way in which its real location could be judged by the eye , Big Brother often looked like a yawning trapdoor set in the face of Jupiter . There was no reason to suppose that a hundred kilometers would be safer than ten , or more dangerous than a thousand ; it merely seemed psychologically right for a first reconnaissance . From that distance , the ship 's telescopes could have revealed details only centimeters across  --  but there were none to be seen . Big Brother appeared completely featureless ; which , for an objectthat had , presumably , survived millions of years of bombardmentby space debris , was incredible . When Floyd stared through the binocular eyepiece , it seemed to him that he could reach out and touch those smooth , ebon surfaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago . That first time , it had been with the gloved hand of his spacesuit . Not until the Tycho monolith had been enclosed in a pressurized dome had he been able to use his naked hand . That had made no difference ; he did not feel that he had ever really touched TMA-1 . The tips of his fingers had seemed to skitter over an invisible barrier , and the harder he pushed , the greater the repulsion grew . He wondered if Big Brother would produce the same effect . Yet before they came that close , they had to make every test they could devise and report their observations to Earth . They were in much the same position as explosives experts trying to defuse a new type of bomb , which might be detonated by the slightest false move . For all that they could tell , even the most delicate of radar probes might trigger some unimaginable catastrophe . For the first twenty-four hours , they did nothing except observewith passive instruments  --  telescopes , cameras , sensors onARTHUR C. CLARKE * 122every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slab 's dimensions with the greatest possible precision , and confirmed the famous 1:4:9 ratio to six decimal places . Big Brother was exactly the same shape as TMA-1  --  but as it was more than two kilometers long , it was 718 times larger than its small sibling . And there was a second mathematical mystery . Men had been arguing for years over that 1:4:9 ratio  --  the squares of the first three integers . That could not possibly be a coincidence ; now here was another number to conjure with . Back on Earth , statisticians and mathematical physicists were soon playing happily with their computers , trying to relate the ratio to the fundamental constants of nature  --  the velocity of light , the proton/electron mass ratio , the fine structure constant . They were quickly joined by a gaggle of numerologists , astrologers , and mystics , who threw in the height of the Great Pyramid , the diameter of Stonehenge , the azimuth bearings of the Nazca lines , the latitude of Easter Island , and a host of other factors from which they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were not in the least deterred when a celebrated Washington humorist claimed that his calculations proved that the world ended on December 31 , 1999  --  but that everyone had had too much of a hangover to notice . Nor did Big Brother appear to notice the two ships that had arrived in its vicinity  --  even when they cautiously probed it with radar beams and bombarded it with strings of radio pulses which , it was hoped , would encourage any intelligent listener to answer in the same fashion . After two frustrating days , with the approval of Mission Control , the ships halved their distance . From fifty kilometers , the largest face of the slab appeared about four times the width of the Moon in Earth 's sky  --  impressive , but not so large as to be psychologically overwhelming . It could not yet compete with Jupiter , ten times larger still ; and already the mood of the expeditionwas changing from awed alertness to a certain impatience . Walter Curnow spoke for almost everyone : " Big Brother may be willing to wait a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little sooner . " 24 . RECONNAISSANCEDISCOVERY HAD LEFT EARTH WITH THREE OF THE LITTLE SPACEpods that allowed an astronaut to perform extravehicular activitiesin shirt-sleeve comfort . One had been lost in the accident  --  ifit was an accident  --  that had killed Frank Poole . Another had carried Dave Bowman to his final appointment with Big Brother , and shared whatever fate befell him . A third was still in the ship 's garage , the Pod Bay . It lacked one important component  --  the hatch , blown off by Commander Bowman when he had made his hazardous vacuum-crossingand entered the ship through the emergency airlock , after Hal had refused to open the Pod Bay door . The resulting blast of air had rocketed the pod several hundred kilometersaway before Bowman , busy with more important matters , had brought it back under radio control . It was not surprising that he had never bothered to replace the missing hatch . Now Pod Number 3 ( on which Max , refusing all explanations , * 123ARTHUR C. CLARKE * 124 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 125 had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EVA . It still lacked a hatch , but that was unimportant . No one would be riding inside . Bowman 's devotion to duty was a piece of unexpected luck , and it would have been folly not to take advantage of it . By using Nina as a robot probe , Big Brother could be examined at close quarters without risking human lives . That at least was the theory ; no one could rule out the possibility of a backlash that might engulf the ship . After all , fifty kilometers was not even a hair 's breadth , as cosmic distances went . After years of neglect , Nina looked distinctly shabby . The dust that was always floating around in zero gee had settled over the outer surface , so that the once immaculately white hull had be- come a dingy gray . As it slowly accelerated away from the ship , its external manipulators folded neatly back and its oval view- port staring spaceward like a huge , dead eye , it did not seem a very impressive ambassador of Mankind . But that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerated , and its small size and low velocity should emphasize its peaceful inten- tions . There had been a suggestion that it should approach Big Brother with open hands ; the idea was quickly turned down when almost everyone agreed that if they saw Nina heading to- ward them , mechanical claws outstretched , they would run for their lives . After a leisurely two-hour trip , Nina came to rest a hundred meters from one corner of the huge rectangular slab . From so close at hand , there was no sense of its true shape ; the TV cam- eras might have been looking down on the tip of a black tetrahedron of indefinite size . The onboard instruments showed no sign of radioactivity or magnetic fields ; nothing whatsoever was coming from Big Brother except the tiny fraction of sunlight it condescended to reflect . After five minutes ' pause  --  the equivalent , it was intended , of " Hello , here I am ! "  --  Nina started a diagonal crossing of the smaller face , then the next larger , and finally the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but occasionally coming in to five . Whatever the separation , Big Brother looked exactly the same  --  smooth and featureless . Long before the mission wascompleted , it had become boring , and the spectators on both ships had gone back to their various jobs , only glancing at the monitors from time to time . " That 's it , " said Walter Curnow at last , when Nina had arrivedback where she had started . " We could spend the rest of our lives doing this , without learning anything more . What do I do with Nina  --  bring her home ? " " No , " said Vasili , breaking into the circuit from aboard Leonov . " I 've a suggestion . Take her to the exact center of the big face . Bring her to rest  --  oh , a hundred meters away . And leave her parked there , with the radar switched to maximum precision . " " No problem  --  except that there 's bound to be some residual drift . But what 's the point ? " " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the gravitational attraction of an infinite flat plate . I never thought I 'd have a chance of using it in real life . After I 've studied Nina 's movements for a few hours , at least I 'll be able to calculate Zagadka 's mass . That is , if it has any . I 'm beginning to think there 's nothing really there . " " There 's an easy way to settle that , and we 'll have to do it eventually . Nina must go in and touch the thing . " " She already has . " " What do you mean ? " asked Curnow , rather indignantly . " I never got nearer than five meters . " " I 'm not criticizing your driving skills  --  though it was a pretty close thing at that first encounter , was n't it ? But you 've been tapping gently on Zagadka every time you use Nina 's thrusters near its surface . " " A flea jumping on an elephant ! " " Perhaps . We simply do n't know . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's aware of our presence , and will only tolerate us as long as we are n't a nuisance . " He left the unspoken question hanging in the air . How did one annoy a two-kilometer-long black rectangular slab ? And just what form would its disapproval take ? 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 12725 . THE VIEW FROM LAGRANGEASTRONOMY WAS FULL OF SUCH INTRIGUING BUT MEANINGLESS COincidences . The most famous was the fact that , from the Earth , both Sun and Moon have the same apparent diameter . Here at the L.1 libration point , which Big Brother had chosen for its cosmicbalancing act on the gravitational tightrope between Jupiter and Io , a similar phenomenon occurred . Planet and satellite appearedexactly the same size . And what a size ! Not the miserable half-degree of Sun and Moon , but forty times their diameter  --  sixteen hundred times their area . The sight of either was enough to fill the mind with awe and wonder ; together , the spectacle was overwhelming . Every forty-two hours , they would go through their complete cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full , and vice versa . But even when the Sun was hiding behind Jupiter and the planet presented only its night side , it was unmistakably there  --  a huge black disk eclipsing the stars . Sometimes that blackness* 126would be momentarily rent by lightning flashes lasting for many seconds , from electrical storms far larger than the Earth . On the opposite side of the sky , always keeping the same face toward its giant master , Io would be a sluggishly boiling cauldronof reds and oranges , with occasional yellow clouds eruptingfrom one of its volcanoes , and falling swiftly back to the surface . Like Jupiter , but on a slightly longer time scale , Io was a world without geography . Its face was remodeled in a matter of decades  --  Jupiter 's , in a matter of days . As Io waned toward its last quarter , so the vast , intricately banded Jovian cloudscape would light up beneath the tiny , distantsun . Sometimes the shadow of Io itself , or one of the outer satellites , would drift across the face of Jupiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Red Spot  --  a hurricane that had endured for centuries if not for millennia . Poised between such wonders , the crew of Leonov had materialfor lifetimes of research  --  but the natural objects of the Joviansystem were at the very bottom of their list of priorities . Big Brother was Number 1 ; though the ships had now moved in to only five kilometers , Tanya still refused to allow any direct physical contact . " I 'm going to wait , " she said , " until we 're in a position to make a quick getaway . We 'll sit and watch  --  until our launch window opens . Then we 'll consider our next move . " It was true that Nina had finally grounded on Big Brother , after a leisurely fifty-minute fall . This had allowed Vasili to calculatethe object 's mass as a surprisingly low 950,000 tons , which gave it about the density of air . Presumably it was hollow  --  whichprovoked endless speculation about what might be inside . But there were plenty of practical , everyday problems to take their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Discovery absorbed ninety percent of their working time , though operations were much more efficient since the two ships had been coupled by a flexible docking connection . Curnowhad finally convinced Tanya that Discovery 's carousel would not suddenly seize up and tear the ships to pieces , so it had become possible to move freely from one vessel to the otherARTHUR C. CLARKE * 128 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 129merely by opening and closing two sets of airtight doors . Spacesuitsand time-consuming EVAs were no longer necessary  --  to the great delight of everyone except Max , who loved going outside and exercising with his broomstick . The two crew members quite unaffected by this were Chandra and Ternovsky , who now virtually lived aboard Discovery and worked around the clock , continuing their apparently endless dialog with Hal . " When will you be ready ? " they were asked at least once a day . They refused to make any promises ; Hal remained a low-grade moron . Then , a week after the rendezvous with Big Brother , Chandra unexpectedly announced : " We 're ready . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's flight deck , and that was merely because there was no room for them ; they were watching on Leonov 's monitors . Floyd stood immediatelybehind Chandra , his hand never far from what Curnow , with his usual gift for the neat phrase , had called his pocket giant-killer . " Let me emphasize again , " said Chandra , " that there must be no talking . Your accents will confuse him ; I can speak , but no one else . Is that understood ? " Chandra looked , and sounded , at the edge of exhaustion . Yet his voice held a note of authority that no one had ever heard before . Tanya might be the boss everywhere else , but he was master here . The audience  --  some anchored to convenient handholds , some floating freely  --  nodded assent . Chandra closed an audio switch and said , quietly but clearly : " Good morning , Hal . " An instant later , it seemed to Floyd that the years had rolled away . It was no longer a simple electronic toy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. Chandra . " " Do you feel capable of resuming your duties ? " " Of course . I am completely operational and all my circuits are functioning perfectly . " " Then do you mind if I ask you a few questions ? " " Not at all . " " Do you recall a failure of the A.E . 35 antenna control unit ? " " Certainly not . " Despite Chandra 's injunction , there was a little gasp from the listeners . This is like tiptoeing through a minefield , thought Floyd , as he patted the reassuring shape of the radio cutoff . If that line of questioning triggered another psychosis , he could kill Hal in a second . ( He knew , having rehearsed the procedure a dozen times . ) But a second was aeons to a computer ; that was a chance they would have to take . " You do not remember either Dave Bowman or Frank Poole going out to replace the A.E . 35 unit ? " " No . That could not have happened , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Who are these people ? I can only identify you  --  though I compute a sixty-five-percent probability that the man behind you is Dr. Heywood Floyd . " Remembering Chandra 's strict injunction , Floyd refrained from congratulating Hal . After a decade , sixty-five percent was a pretty good score . Many humans would not have done so well . " Do n't worry , Hal  --  I will explain everything later . " " Has the mission been completed ? You know I have the greatestenthusiasm for it . " " The mission has been completed ; you have carried out your program . Now  --  if you will excuse us  --  we wish to have a privateconversation . " " Certainly . " Chandra switched off sound and vision inputs to the main console . As far as this part of the ship was concerned , Hal was now deaf and blind . " Well , what was all that about ? " demanded Vasili Orlov . " It means , " said Chandra , carefully and precisely , " that I have erased all Hal 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That sounds quite a feat , " marveled Sasha . " How did you do it ? " " I am afraid it would take me longer to explain than it did to carry out the operation . " " Chandra , I am a computer expert  --  though not in the same class as you and Nikolai . The 9000 series uses holographic memories , does n't it ? So you could n't have used a simpleARTHUR C. CLARKE * 130chronological erasure . It must have been some kind of tapeworm , homing on selected words and concepts . " " Tapeworm ? " said Katerina over the ship 's intercom . " I thought that was my department  --  though I 'm glad to say I 've never seen one of the beastly things outside a jar of alcohol . What are you talking about ? " " Computer jargon , Katerina . In the old days  --  the very old days  --  they really did use magnetic tape . And it 's possible to construct a program that can be fed into a system to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  any desired memories . Ca n't you do the same sort of thing to human beings , by hypnosis ? " " Yes , but it can always be reversed . We never really forget anything . We only think we do . " " A computer does n't work that way . When it 's told to forget something , it does . The information is completely erased . " " So Hal has absolutely no memory of his . . . misbehavior ? " " I can not be a hundred percent certain of that , " answered Chandra . " There may be some memories that were in transit from one address to another when the . . . tapeworm was makingits search . But this is very unlikely . " " Fascinating , " said Tanya , after everyone had thought this over in silence for some time . " But the much more important question is : Can he be relied upon in future ? " Before Chandra could answer , Floyd anticipated him . " The same set of circumstances can never arise again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started because it 's difficult to explain Security to a computer . " " Or to human beings , " muttered Curnow , not very sotto voce . " I hope you 're right , " said Tanya , without much conviction . " What 's the next step , Chandra ? " " Nothing so tricky  --  merely long and tedious . Now we have to program him to initiate the Jupiter escape sequence  --  and to bring Discovery home . Three years after we 've got back on our high-speed orbit . " 26 . PROBATIONTo : Victor Millson , Chairman , National Council on Astronautics , WashingtonFrom : Heywood Floyd , aboard USSC DiscoverySubject : Malfunction of onboard computer HAL 9000 Classification : SECRETDr . Chandrasegarampillai ( hereinafter referred to as Dr. C. ) has now completed his preliminary examination of Hal . He has restored all missing modules and the computer appears to be fully operational . Details of Dr. C. 's actions and conclusionswill be found in the report he and Dr. Ternovsky will submit shortly . Meanwhile you have asked me to summarize them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new members who will not be familiar with the background . Frankly , I doubt my ability to do this ; as you know , I am not a computer specialist . But I will do my best . The problem was apparently caused by a conflict between* 131ARTHUR C. CLARKE * 132 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 133Hal 's basic instructions and the requirements of Security . By direct Presidential order , the existence of TMA-1 was kept a complete secret . Only those with a need to know were permittedaccess to the information . Discovery 's mission to Jupiter was already in the advanced planning stage when TMA-1 was excavated , and radiated its signal to that planet . As the function of the prime crew ( Bowman , Poole ) was merely to get the vessel to its destination , it was decided that they should not be informed of its new objective . By training the investigative team ( Kaminski , Hunter , Whitehead ) separately , and placing them in hibernation before the voyage began , it was felt that a much higher degree of security would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or otherwise ) would be greatly reduced . I would like to remind you that , at the time ( my memorandumNCA 342/23/TOP SECRET of 01.04.30 ) I pointed out severalobjections to this policy . However , they were overruled at a higher level . As Hal was capable of operating the ship without human assistance , it was also decided that he should be programed to carry out the mission autonomously in the event of the crew 's being incapacitated or killed . He was therefore given full knowledge of its objectives , but was not permitted to reveal them to Bowman or Poole . This situation conflicted with the purpose for which Hal had been designed  --  the accurate processing of information without distortion or concealment . As a result , Hal developed what would be called , in human terms , a psychosis  --  specifically , schizophrenia . Dr. C. informs me that , in technical terminology , Hal became trapped in a Hofstadter  --  Moebius loop , a situation apparently not uncommon among advanced computerswith autonomous goal-seeking programs . He suggests that for further information you contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand Dr. C. ) Hal was faced with an intolerable dilemma , and so developed paranoiac symptomsthat were directed against those monitoring his performanceback on Earth . He accordingly attempted to break the radio link with Mission Control , first by reporting a ( nonexistent ) fault in the AE 35 antenna unit . This involved him not only in a direct lie  --  which musthave aggravated his psychosis still further  --  but also in a confrontation with the crew . Presumably ( we can only guess at this , of course ) he decided that the only way out of the situation was to eliminate his human colleagues  --  which he very nearly succeeded in doing . Looking at the matter purely objectively , it would have been interesting to see what would have happened had he continued the mission alone , without manmade " interference . " This is virtually all I have been able to learn from Dr. C. ; I do not like to question him further , as he is working to the point of exhaustion . But even allowing for this fact , I must frankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. C. is not always as cooperative as he should be . He adopts a defensive attitude toward Hal , which sometimes makes it extremely difficult to discuss the subject . Even Dr. Ternovsky , who might have been expected to be a little more independent , often appears to share this viewpoint . However , the only really important question is : Can Hal be relied upon in the future ? Dr. C. , of course , has no doubts on the matter . He claims to have obliterated all the computer 's memories of the traumatic events leading up to the disconnection . Nor does he believe that Hal can suffer from anything remotely analogous to the human sense of guilt . In any case , it seems impossible that the situation that caused the original problem can ever arise again . Although Hal suffers from a number of peculiarities , they are not of a nature that would cause any apprehension ; they are merely minor annoyances , some of them even amusing . And as you know  --  but Dr. C. does not  --  I have taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort . To sum up : The rehabilitation of Hal 9000 is proceeding satisfactorily . One might even say that he is on probation . I wonder if he knows it. 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 13527 . INTERLUDE : TRUE CONFESSIONSTHE HUMAN MIND HAS AN ASTONISHING CAPACITY TO ADAPT ; after a while , even the incredible becomes commonplace . There were times when the crew of Leonov switched off their surroundings , perhaps in an unconscious move to preserve sanity . Dr. Heywood Floyd often thought that , on such occasions , Walter Curnow worked a little too hard at being the life and soul of the party . Yet though he triggered what Sasha Kovalev later called the " True Confessions " episode , he certainly had not planned anything of the sort . It arose spontaneously when he voiced the universal dissatisfaction with almost all aspects of zero-gravity plumbing . " If I could have one wish granted , " he exclaimed during the daily Six O'Clock Soviet , " it would be to soak in a nice foaming tub , scented with essence of pine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murmurs of assent and sighs of frustrated desire had died away , Katerina Rudenko took up the challenge . " How splendidly decadent , Walter , " she beamed at him with cheerful disapproval . " It makes you sound like a Roman emperor . If I were back on Earth , I 'd like something more active . " " Such as ? " " Umm . . . Am I allowed to go back in time as well ? " " If you like . " " When I was a girl , I used to go for holidays to a collective farm in Georgia . There was a beautiful palomino stallion , bought by the director out of the money he 'd made on the local black market . He was an old scoundrel , but I loved him  --  and he used to let me gallop Alexander all over the countryside . I might have been killed  --  but that 's the memory that brings Earth back to me , more than anything else . " There was a moment of thoughtful silence ; then Curnow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so lost in their own memories that the game might have ended there , had not Maxim Brailovsky started it off again . " I 'd like to be diving  --  that was just about my favorite hobby , when I had time for one  --  and I was glad I could keep it up through my cosmonaut training . I 've dived off Pacific atolls , the Great Barrier Reef , the Red Sea  --  coral reefs are the most beautifulplaces in the world . Yet the experience I remember best was in quite a different place  --  one of the Japanese kelp forests . It was like an underwater cathedral , with sunlight slanting through those enormous leaves . Mysterious . . . magical . I 've never been back ; perhaps it would n't be the same the next time . But I 'd like to try . " " Fine , " said Walter , who as usual had appointed himself masterof ceremonies . " Who 's next ? " " I 'll give you a quick answer , " said Tanya Orlova . " The Bolshoi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He hates ballet . " " That makes two of us . Anyway , what would you select , Vasili ? " " I was going to say diving , but Max beat me to it . So I 'll go in the opposite direction  --  gliding . Soaring through the clouds on aARTHUR C. CLARKE * 136summer day , in complete silence . Well , not quite complete  --  the airflow over the wing can get noisy , especially when you 're banking . That 's the way to enjoy Earth  --  like a bird . " " Zenia ? " " Easy . Skiing in the Pamirs . I love snow . " " And you , Chandra ? " The atmosphere changed noticeably when Walter put the question . After all this time , Chandra was still a stranger  --  perfectlypolite , even courteous , but never revealing himself . " When I was a boy , " he said slowly , " my grandfather took me on a pilgrimage to Varanasi  --  Benares . If you 've never been there , I 'm afraid you wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever their religion  --  it 's the center of the world . One day I plan to go back . " " And you , Nikolai ? " " Well , we 've had the sea and the sky . I 'd like to combine both . My favorite sport used to be wind-surfing . I 'm afraid I 'm too old for it now  --  but I 'd like to find out . " " That only leaves you , Woody . What 's your choice ? " Floyd did not even stop to think ; his spontaneous answer surprisedhimself as much as the others . " I do n't mind where on Earth I am  --  as long as I 'm with my little son . " After that , there was no more to be said . The session was over. 28 . FRUSTRATION " . . . YOU 'VE SEEN ALL THE TECHNICAL REPORTS , DIMITRI , SO you 'll understand our frustration . We 've learned nothing new from all our tests and measurements . Zagadka just sits there , filling half the sky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inert  --  an abandoned space derelict . Vasili has pointed out that it must be taking some positive action , to remainhere at the unstable libration point . Otherwise it would have drifted away ages ago , just as Discovery did , and crashed into Io . " So what do we do next ? We would n't have nuclear explosiveson board , would we , in contravention of UN ' 08 , para 3 ? I 'm only joking . . . " Now that we 're under less pressure , and the launch window for the homeward trip is still weeks away , there 's a distinct feeling of boredom , as well as frustration . Do n't laugh  --  I can imaginehow that sounds to you , back in Moscow . How could any 137ARTHUR C. CLARKE * 139intelligent person get bored out here , surrounded by the greatest marvels human eyes have ever seen ? " Yet there 's no doubt of it . Morale is n't what it was . Until now , we 've all been disgustingly healthy . Now almost everyone has a minor cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't heal despite all of Katerina 's pills and powders . She 's given up now , and just swears at us . " Sasha has helped to keep us amused with a series of bulletinson the ship 's bulletin board . Their theme is : STAMP OUT RUSSLISH ! and he lists horrid mixtures of both languages he claims to have overheard , wrong uses of words , and so forth . We 'll all need linguistic decontamination when we get home ; several times I 've come across your countrymen chatting in Englishwithout even being aware of it , lapsing into their native tongue only for difficult words . The other day I caught myself talking Russian to Walter Curnow  --  and neither of us noticed for several minutes . " There was one bit of unscheduled activity the other day that will tell you something about our state of mind . The fire alarm went off in the middle of the night , triggered by one of the smoke detectors . " Well , it turned out that Chandra had smuggled some of his lethal cigars aboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking one in the toilet , like a guilty schoolboy . " Of course , he was horribly embarrassed ; everyone else thought it hysterically funny , after the initial panic . You know the way some perfectly trivial joke , which does n't mean a thing to outsiders , can sweep through a group of otherwise intelligent people and reduce them to helpless laughter . One had only to pretend to light a cigar for the next few days , and everybody would go to pieces . " What makes it even more ridiculous is that no one would have minded in the least if Chandra had just gone into an airlock , or switched off the smoke detector . But he was too shy to admit that he had such a human weakness ; so now he spends even more of his time communing with Hal . " Floyd pressed the PAUSE button and stopped the recording . Perhaps it was not fair to make fun of Chandra , tempting thoughit often was . All sorts of little quirks of personality had surfaced during the last few weeks ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious reason . And for that matter , what of his own behavior ? Had that always been above criticism ? He was still not sure if he had handled Curnow properly . Though he did not suppose that he would ever really like the big engineer , or enjoy the sound of his slightly too-loud voice , Floyd 's attitude toward him had changed from mere tolerance to respectful admiration . The Russians adored him , not least because his rendering of such favorites as " Polyushko Polye " often reduced them to tears . And in one case , Floyd felt that the adorationhad gone a little too far . " Walter , " he had begun cautiously , " I 'm not sure if it 's my business , but there 's a personal matter I 'd like to raise with you . " " When someone says it 's not his business , he 's usually right . What 's the problem ? " " To be blunt , your behavior with Max . " There was a frigid silence , which Floyd occupied with a carefulinspection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curnow replied , in a soft yet implacable voice : " I was under the distinct impression that he was more than eighteen . " " Do n't confuse the issue . And frankly , it 's not Max I 'm concernedabout . It 's Zenia . " Curnow 's lips parted in unconcealed surprise . " Zenia ? What 's she got to do with it ? " " For an intelligent man , you 're often singularly unobservant  --  even obtuse . Surely you realize that she 's in love with Max . Have n't you noticed the way she looks , when you put your arm around him ? " Floyd had never imagined that he would see Curnow looking abashed , but the blow seemed to have struck home . " Zenia ? I thought everyone was joking  --  she 's such a quiet littlemouse . And everyone 's in love with Max , after their fashion  --  evenCatherine the Great . Still . . . um , I guess I should be more careful . At least while Zenia 's around . " There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , obviously to show that there was noARTHUR C. CLARKE * 140 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 141ill feeling , Curnow added in a conversational tone : " You know , I 've often wondered about Zenia . Somebody did a marvelous job of plastic surgery on her face , but they could n't repair all the damage . The skin 's too tight , and I do n't think I 've ever seen her laugh properly . Maybe that 's why I 've avoided looking at her  --  would you credit me with so much aesthetic sensitivity , Heywood ? " The deliberately formal " Heywood " signaled good-natured needling rather than hostility , and Floyd allowed himself to relax . " I can satisfy some of your curiosity  --  Washington finally got hold of the facts . It seems she was in a bad air crash and was lucky to recover from her burns . There 's no mystery , as far as we can tell , but Aeroflot is n't supposed to have accidents . " " Poor girl . I 'm surprised they let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified person available when Irina eliminated herself . I 'm sorry for her ; apart from the injuries , the psychological shock must have been terrible . " " I 'm sure it was ; but she 's obviously made a full recovery . " You 're not telling the whole truth , said Floyd to himself , and you never will . After their encounter on the approach to Jupiter , there would always be a secret bond between them  --  not of love , but of tenderness , which is often more enduring . He found himself suddenly and unexpectedly grateful to Curnow ; the other was obviously surprised at his concern for Zenia , but had not attempted to exploit it in his own defense . And if he had , would it have been unfair ? Now , days later , Floyd was beginning to wonder if his own motives were altogetheradmirable . For his part , Curnow had certainly kept his promise ; indeed , if one did not know better , one might have imagined that he was deliberately ignoring Max  --  at least while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater kindness ; indeed , there were occasions when he had even succeeded in making her laugh out loud . So the intervention had been worthwhile , whatever the impulsebehind it . Even if , as Floyd sometimes ruefully suspected , it was no more than the secret envy that normal homo- or heterosexualsfeel , if completely honest with themselves , toward cheerfully well-adjusted polymorphs . His finger crept back toward the recorder , but the train of thought had been broken . Inevitably , images of his own home and family came crowding into his mind . He closed his eyes , and memory recalled the climax of Christopher 's birthday party  --  the child blowing out the three candles on the cake , less than twenty-four hours ago but almost a billion kilometers away . He had played the video back so often that now he knew the scene by heart . And how often had Caroline played his messages to Chris , so that the boy would not forget his father  --  or view him as a stranger when he returned after missing yet another birthday ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame Caroline . To him , only a few weeks would have passed before they met again . But she would have aged more than two years while he was in his dreamless sleep between the worlds . That was a long time to be a young widow , even a temporary one . I wonder if I 'm coming down with one of the shipboard maladies , Floyd thought ; he had seldom felt such a sense of frustration , even of failure . I may have lost my family , across the gulfs of time and space , all to no purpose . For I have achieved nothing ; even though I have reached my goal , it remains a blank , impenetrable wall of total darkness . And yet  --  David Bowman had once cried : " My God ! It 's full of stars ! " 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 14329 . EMERGENCESASHA 'S LATEST EDICT READ : RUSSLISH BULLETIN #8Subject : Tovarishch ( tovarish ) To our American guests : Frankly , pals , I ca n't remember when I was last addressed by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back there with the battleship Potemkin  --  a reminder of cloth caps and red flags and Vladimir Ilich haranguing the workers from the steps of railway carriages . Ever since I was a kid it 's been bratets or druzhok  --  take your choice . You 're welcome . Comrade KovalevFloyd was still chuckling over this notice when Vasili Orlov * 142joined him as he floated through the lounge/observation deck on his way to the bridge . " What amazes me , tovarishch , is that Sasha ever found time to study anything besides engineering physics . Yet he 's always quoting poems and plays I do n't even know , and he speaks betterEnglish than  --  well , Walter . " " Because he switched to science , Sasha is  --  what do you say ?  --  the black sheep of the family . His father was a professor of English at Novosibirsk . Russian was only allowed in the house Monday to Wednesday ; Thursday to Saturday it was English . " " And Sundays ? " " Oh , French or German , alternate weeks . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fits me like a glove . Does Sasha feel guilty about his . . . defection ? And with such a background , why did he ever become an engineer ? " " At Novosibirsk , you soon learn who are the serfs and who are the aristocrats . Sasha was an ambitious young man , as well as a brilliant one . " " Just like you , Vasili . " " Et tu , Brute ! You see , I can quote Shakespeare as well  --  Bozhe moi !  --  what was that ? " Floyd was unlucky ; he was floating with his back to the observationwindow , and saw nothing at all . When he twisted around , seconds later , there was only the familiar view of Big Brother , bisecting the giant disk of Jupiter , just as it had done ever since their arrival . But to Vasili , for a moment that would be imprinted on his memory forever , that sharp-edged outline held a completely different , and wholly impossible , scene . It was as if a window had suddenly been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a second , before his involuntaryblink reflex cut it off . He was looking into a field not of stars , but of suns , as if into the crowded heart of a galaxy , or the core of a globular cluster . In that moment , Vasili Orlov lost foreverthe skies of Earth . From now on they would seem intolerablyempty ; even mighty Orion and glorious Scorpio would be scarcely noticeable patterns of feeble sparks , not worthy of a secondglance. 1ARTHUR C. CLARKE * 144When he dared to open his eyes again , it was all gone . No  --  not completely . At the very center of the now-restored ebon rectangle , a faint star was still shining . But a star did not move as one watched . Orlov blinked again , to clear his watering eyes . Yes , the movement was real ; he was not imagining it . A meteor ? It was some indication of Chief Scientist Vasili Orlov'sstate of shock that several seconds passed before he remembered that meteors were impossible in airless space . Then it blurred suddenly into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanished beyond the edge of Jupiter . By this time , Vasili had recovered his wits and was once more the cool , dispassionate observer . Already he had a good estimate of the object 's trajectory . There could be no doubt ; it was aimed directly at Earth . A CHILD OFTHE STARS30 . HOMECOMINGIT WAS AS IF HE HAD AWAKENED FROM A DREAM-OR A DREAMwithin a dream . The gate between the stars had brought him back to the world of men , but no longer as a man . How long had he been away ? A whole lifetime . . . no , two lifetimes ; one forward , one in reverse . As David Bowman , commander and last surviving crew member of United States Spaceship Discovery , he had been caught in a gigantic trap , set three million years ago and triggered to respondonly at the right time , and to the right stimulus . He had fallen through it , from one universe to another , meeting wonders some of which he now understood , others which he might never comprehend . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until he had outraced light itself . That , he knew , was impossible ; but now he also knew how it could be done . As* 147ARTHUR C. CLARKE * 148 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 149Einstein had rightly said , the Good Lord was subtle , but nevermalicious . He had passed through a cosmic switching system  --  a GrandCentral Station of the galaxies  --  and emerged , protected from itsfury by unknown forces , close to the surface of a giant red star . There he had witnessed the paradox of sunrise on the face of asun , when the dying star 's brilliant white dwarf companion hadclimbed into its sky  --  a searing apparition , drawing a tidal waveof fire beneath it . He had felt no fear , but only wonder , even when his space pod had carried him down into the infernobelow .. . ... to arrive , beyond all reason , in a beautifully appointedhotel suite containing nothing that was not wholly familiar . However , much of it was fake ; the books on the shelves were dummies , the cereal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though they bore famous labels  --  all contained the same bland food with a texture like bread but a taste that was almost anythinghe cared to imagine . He had quickly realized that he was a specimen in a cosmic zoo , his cage carefully recreated from the images in old televisionprograms . And he wondered when his keepers would appear , and in what physical form . How foolish that expectation had been ! He knew now that one might as well hope to see the wind , or speculate about the trueshape of fire . Then exhaustion of mind and body had overwhelmed him . For the last time , David Bowman slept . It was a strange sleep , for he was not wholly unconscious . Like a fog creeping through a forest , something invaded his mind . He sensed it only dimly , for the full impact would have destroyed him as swiftly and surely as the fires raging around him . Beneath its dispassionate scrutiny , he felt neither hope norfear . Sometimes , in that long sleep , he dreamed he was awake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mirror , at a wrinkled face he barely recognized as his own . His body wasracing to its dissolution , the hands of the biological clock spinningmadly toward a midnight they would never reach . For at the last moment , Time came to a halt  --  and reversed itself . The springs of memory were being tapped ; in controlled recollection , he was reliving the past , being drained of knowledge and experience as he swept back toward his childhood . But nothing was being lost ; all that he had ever been , at every moment of his life , was being transferred to safer keeping . Even as one David Bowman ceased to exist , another became immortal , passing beyond the necessities of matter . He was an embryo god , not yet ready to be born . For ages he floated in limbo , knowing what he had been , but not what he had become . He was still in a state of flux  --  somewhere between chrysalis and butterfly . Or perhaps only between caterpillar and chrysalis .. . And then , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The black , rectangular slab that suddenly appeared before him was like an old friend . He had seen it on the Moon ; he had encountered it in orbit around Jupiter ; and he knew , somehow , that his ancestors had met it long ago . Though it held still unfathomed secrets , it was no longer a total mystery ; some of its powers he now understood . He realized that it was not one , but multitudes ; and that whatevermeasuring instruments might say , it was always the same size as large as necessary . How obvious , now , was that mathematical ratio of its sides , the quadratic sequence 1:4:9 ! And how naive to have imagined that the series ended there , in only three dimensions ! Even as his mind focused upon these geometrical simplicities , the empty rectangle filled with stars . The hotel suite  --  if indeed it had ever really existed  --  dissolved back into the mind of its creator ; and there before him was the luminous whirlpool of the Galaxy . It might have been some beautiful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it was the reality , now grasped by him as a whole with senses more subtle than vision . ARTHUR C. CLARKE * 150 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 151If he wished , he could focus his attention upon any one of its hundred billion stars . Here he was , adrift in this great river of suns , halfway between the banked fires of the galactic core and the lonely , scattered sentinel stars of the rim . And there was his origin , on the far side of this chasm in the sky , this serpentine band of darkness , empty of all stars . He knew that this formless chaos , visible only by the glow that limned its edges from fire mists far beyond , was the still unused stuff of creation , the raw material of evolutions yet to be . Here , Time had not yet begun ; not until the suns that now burned were long since dead would light and life reshape this void . Unwittingly , he had crossed it once : now , far better prepared , though still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must cross it again .. . The Galaxy burst forth from the mental frame in which he had enclosed it ; stars and nebulae poured past him in an illusion of infinite speed . Phantom suns exploded and fell behind as he slipped like a shadow through their cores . The stars were thinning out , the glare of the Milky Way dimminginto a pale ghost of the glory he had known  --  and might one day know again . He was back in the space that men called real , at the very point he had left it , seconds or centuries ago . He was vividly aware of his surroundings , and far more consciousthan in that earlier existence of a myriad sensory inputs from the external world . He could focus upon any one of them , and scrutinize it in virtually limitless detail , until he confronted the fundamental , granular structure of time and space , below which there was only chaos . And he could move , though he did not know how . But had he ever really known that , even when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to limb was a mystery to which he had never given any thought . An effort of will , and the spectrum of that nearby star shifted toward the blue , by precisely the amount he wished . He was falling toward it at a large fraction of the speed of light ; though he could go faster if he desired , he was in no hurry . There was still much information to be processed , much to be considered ... and much more to be won . That , he knew , was his present goal ; but he also knew that it was only part of some far wider plan , to be revealed in due course . He gave no thought to the gateway between universes dwindlingso swiftly behind him , or to the anxious entities gathered around it in their primitive spacecraft . They were part of his memories ; but stronger ones were calling him now ; calling him home to the world he had never thought to see again . He could hear its myriad voices , growing louder and louder  --  as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sun 's outstretched corona , to a slim crescent , and finally to a glorious blue-white disk . They knew that he was coming . Down there on that crowded globe , the alarms would be flashing across the radar screens , the great tracking telescopes would be searching the skies  --  and historyas men had known it would be drawing to a close . A thousand kilometers below , he became aware that a slumberingcargo of death had awakened , and was stirring in its orbit . The feeble energies it contained were no possible menace to him ; indeed , he could profitably use them . He entered the maze of circuitry , and swiftly traced the way to its lethal core . Most of the branchings could be ignored ; they were blind alleys , devised for protection . Beneath his scrutiny , their purpose was childishly simple ; it was easy to bypass them all . Now there was a single last barrier  --  a crude but effective mechanicalrelay , holding apart two contacts . Until they were closed , there would be no power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and , for the first time , knew failure and frustration . The few grams of the microswitch would not budge . He was still a creature of pure energy ; as yet , the world of inert matter was beyond his grasp . Well , there was a simple answer to that . He still had much to learn . The current pulse he induced in the relay was so powerful that it almost melted the coil , before it could operate the trigger mechanism . ARTHUR C. CLARKE * 152The microseconds ticked slowly by . It was interesting to observe the explosive lenses focus their energies , like the feeble match that ignites a powder train , which in turnThe megatons flowered in a silent detonation that brought a brief , false dawn to half the sleeping world . Like a phoenix risingfrom the flames , he absorbed what he needed , and discarded the rest . Far below , the shield of the atmosphere , which protectedthe planet from so many hazards , absorbed the most dangerousof the radiation . But there would be some unlucky men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the explosion , it seemed as if the Earth was struck dumb . The babble of the short and medium waves was completely silenced , reflected back by the suddenly enhanced ionosphere . Only the microwaves still sliced through the invisibleand slowly dissolving mirror that now surrounded the planet , and most of these were too tightly beamed for him to receive them . A few high-powered radars were still focused upon him , but that was a matter of no importance . He did not even bother to neutralize them as he could easily have done . And if any more bombs were to come his way , he would treat them with equal indifference . For the present , he had all the energy he needed . And now he was descending , in great sweeping spirals , towardthe lost landscape of his childhood. 31 . DISNEYVILLEA FIN-DE-SIECLE PHILOSOPHER HAD ONCE REMARKED-AND BEENroundly denounced for his pains  --  that Walter Elias Disney had contributed more to genuine human happiness than all the religiousteachers in history . Now , half a century after the artist 's death , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had opened in the early 1980s , his Experimental PrototypeCommunity of Tomorrow had been a showcase for new technologies and modes of living . But as its founder had realized , EPCOT would only fulfill its purpose when some of its vast acreage was a genuine , living town , occupied by people who called it home . That process had taken the remainder of the century ; now the residential area had twenty thousand inhabitantsand had , inevitably , become popularly known as Disneyville . Because they could move in only after penetrating a palace* 153ARTHUR C. CLARKE * 154 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 155guard of WED lawyers , it was not surprising that the average age of the occupants was the highest in any United States community , or that its medical services were the most advanced in the world . Some of them , indeed , could hardly have been conceived , still less created , in any other place . The apartment had been carefully designed not to look like a hospital suite , and only a few unusual fittings would have betrayedits purpose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of falls was minimized : it could , however , be raised and tilted for the convenience of the nurses . The bathroom tub was sunk into the floor , and had a built-in seat as well as handrails , so that even the elderly or infirm could get in and out of it easily . The floor was thickly carpeted , but there were no rugs over which one could trip , or sharp corners that might cause injuries . Other details were less obvious  --  and the TV camera was so well concealed that no one would have suspected its presence . There were few personal touches  --  a pile of old books in one corner , and a framed front page of one of the last printed issues of the New York Times proclaiming : u.s . SPACESHIP LEAVES FOR JUPITER . Close to this were two photographs , one showing a boy in his late teens ; the other , a considerably older man wearing astronaut 's uniform . Though the frail , gray-haired woman watching the domestic comedy unfolding on the TV panel was not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time she chuckled appreciativelyat some joke from the screen , but she kept glancing at the door as if expecting a visitor . And when she did so , she took a firmer grasp on the walking stick propped against her chair . Yet she was distracted by a moment of TV drama when the door finally opened , and she looked around with a guilty start as the little service trolley rolled into the room , followed closely by a uniformed nurse . " Time for lunch , Jessie , " called the nurse . " We 've got something very nice for you today . " " Do n't want any lunch . " " It will make you feel a lot better . " " I wo n't eat until you tell me what it is . " " Why wo n't you eat it ? " " I 'm not hungry . Are you ever hungry ? " she added slyly . The robot food trolley came to a halt beside the chair , and the transport covers opened up to reveal the dishes . Throughout , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trolley . She now stood motionless , with a rather fixed smile , looking at her difficult patient . In the monitor room fifty meters away , the medical technician said to the doctor : " Now watch this . " Jessie 's gnarled hand lifted the walking stick ; then , with surprisingspeed , she swept it in a short arc toward the nurse 's legs . The nurse took no notice whatsoever , even when the stick sliced right through her . Instead , she remarked soothingly , " Now , does n't that look nice ? Eat it up , dear . " A cunning smile spread across Jessie 's face , but she obeyed instructions . In a moment , she was eating heartily . " You see ? " said the technician . " She knows perfectly well what 's going on . She 's a lot brighter than she pretends to be , most of the time . " " And she 's the first ? " " Yes . All the others believe that really is Nurse Williams , bringing their meals . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look how pleased she is , just because she 's outsmarted us . She 's eating her food , which is the purpose of the exercise . But we must warn the nurses  --  all of them , not just Williams . " " Why  --  oh , of course . The next time it may not be a hologram  --  andthen think of the lawsuits we 'll be facing from our battered staff . " 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 15732 . CRYSTAL SPRINGTHE INDIANS , AND THE CAJUN SETTLERS WHO HAD MOVED HEREfrom Louisiana , said that Crystal Spring was bottomless . That , of course , was nonsense , and surely even they could not believe it . One had only to put on a face mask and swim out a few strokes  --  and there , clearly visible , was the little cave from which the incredibly pure water flowed with the slender green weeds undulating around it . And peering up through them , the eyes of the Monster . Two dark circles , side by side  --  even though they never moved , what else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement to every swim ; one day the Monster would come rushing up from its lair , scattering the fish in its hunt for larger prey . Never would Bobby or David admit that nothing more dangerous than an abandoned , and doubtless stolen , bicyclelay half buried among the water weeds , a hundred metersdown. * 156That depth was hard to believe , even after line and sinker had established it beyond argument . Bobby , the older and better diver , had been perhaps a tenth of the way down , and had reportedthat the bottom looked just as far away as ever . But now the Crystal Spring was about to reveal its secrets ; perhaps the legend of the Confederate treasure was true , despite the scorn of all the local historians . At the very least , they might endear themselves to the chief of police  --  always excellent policy  --  byrecovering a few handguns deposited after recent crimes . The little air compressor that Bobby had found in the garage junk heap was now chugging healthily away , after their initial problems of starting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud of blue smoke , but it showed no sign of stopping . " And even if it does , " said Bobby , " so what ? If the girls in the Underwater Theater can swim up from . fifty meters without their air hoses , so can we . It 's perfectly safe . " In that case , thought Dave fleetingly , why did n't we tell Ma what we were doing , and why did we wait until Dad had gone back to the Cape for the next shuttle launch ? But he did not have any real qualms : Bobby always knew best . It must be wonderful to be seventeen , and to know everything . Though he wished he would n't spend quite so much time now with that stupid Betty Schultz . True , she was very pretty  --  but , dammit , she was a girl ! It was only with the greatest difficulty that they had been able to get rid of her this morning . Dave was used to being a guinea pig ; that was what younger brothers were for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flippers , and slid into the crystalline water . Bobby handed him the air hose with the old scuba mouthpiecethey had taped to it . Dave took a breath , and grimaced . " It tastes horrible . " " You 'll get used to it . In you go  --  no deeper than that ledge . That 's where I 'll start adjusting the pressure valve so we do n't waste too much air . Come up when I tug the hose . " Dave slid gently beneath the surface , and into wonderland . It was a peaceful , monochrome world , so different from the coral reefs of the Keys . There were none of the garish colors of theARTHUR C. CLARKE * 158 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 159marine environment , where life  --  animal and vegetable  --  flaunted itself with all the hues of the rainbow . Here were only delicate shades of blue and green , and fish that looked like fish , not like butterflies . He flippered slowly down , . dragging the hose behind him , pausing to drink from its stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of freedom was so wonderful that he almost forgot the horrible oily taste in his mouth . When he reached the ledge  --  actually an ancient , waterlogged tree trunk , so overgrown with weeds that it was unrecognizable  --  he sat down and looked around him . He could see right across the spring , to the green slopes at the far side of the flooded crater , at least a hundred meters away . There were not many fish around , but a small school went twinklingpast like a shower of silver coins in the sunlight streaming down from above . There was also an old friend stationed , as usual , at the gap where the waters of the spring began their journey to the sea . A small alligator ( " But large enough , " Bobby had once said cheerfully . " He 's bigger than I am. " ) was hanging vertically , without visible means of support , only his nose above the surface . They had never bothered him , and he had never bothered them . The air hose gave an impatient tug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized how cold it could get at that hitherto unattainabledepth  --  and he was also feeling distinctly sick . But the hot sunlight soon revived his spirits . " No problems , " said Bobby expansively . " Just keep unscrewingthe valve so the pressure gauge does n't drop below the red line . " " How deep are you going ? " " All the way , if I feel like it . " Dave did not take that seriously ; they both knew about rapture of the depths and nitrogen narcosis . And in any case , the old garden hose was only thirty meters long . That would be plenty for this first experiment . As he had done so many times before , he watched with enviousadmiration as his beloved elder brother accepted a new challenge . Swimming as effortlessly as the fish around him , Bobby glided downward into that blue , mysterious universe . He turned once and pointed vigorously to the air hose , making it unmistakably clear that he needed an increased air flow . Despite the splitting headache that had suddenly come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the ancient c  --  pressor , and opened the control valve to its deadly maximum  --  fiftyparts per million of carbon monoxide . The last he saw of Bobby was that confidently descending , sunlight-dappled figure passing forever beyond his reach . The wax statue in the funeral parlor was a total stranger , who had nothing to do with Robert Bowman. 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 16133 . BETTYWHY HAD HE COME HERE , RETURNING LIKE AN UNQUIET GHOST TOthe scene of ancient anguish ? He had no idea ; indeed , he had not been conscious of his destination , until the round eye of Crystal Spring had gazed up at him from the forest below . He was master of the world , yet he was paralyzed by a sense of devastating grief he had not known for years . Time had healed the wound , as it always does ; yet it seemed only yesterdaythat he had stood weeping beside the emerald mirror , seeing only the reflections of the surrounding cypresses with their burden of Spanish moss . What was happening to him ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept by some gentle current , he was drifting northward , toward the state capital . He was looking for something ; what it was , he would not know until he found it . No one , and no instrument , detected his passage . He was no longer radiating wastefully , but had almost mastered his control* 160of energy , as once he had mastered lost though not forgotten limbs . He sank like a mist into the earthquake-proof vaults , until he found himself among billions of stored memories , and dazzling , flickering networks of electronic thoughts . This task was more complex than the triggering of a crude nuclear bomb , and took him a little longer . Before he found the information he was seeking , he made one trivial slip , but did not bother to correct it . No one ever understood why , the next month , three hundred Florida taxpayers , all of whose names began with F , received checks for precisely one dollar . It cost many times the overpayment to straighten matters out , and the baffled computer engineers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the whole , was not so very far from the truth . In a few milliseconds , he had moved from Tallahassee to 634 South Magnolia Street , Tampa . It was still the same address ; he need not have wasted time looking it up . But then , he had never intended to look it up , until the very moment when he had done so . After three births and two abortions , Betty Fernandez ( nt e Schultz ) was still a beautiful woman . At the moment she was also a very thoughtful one ; she was watching a TV program that brought back memories , bitter and sweet . It was a News Special , triggered by the mysterious events of the preceding twelve hours , beginning with the warning that Leonov had beamed back from the moons of Jupiter . Something was heading for Earth ; something had  --  harmlessly  --  detonated an orbiting nuclear bomb which no one had come forward to claim . That was all , but it was quite enough . The news commentators had dredged up all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going back to the once top-secret records showing the discovery of TMA-1 on the Moon . For the fiftieth time , at least , she heard that eerie radio shriek as the monolith greeted the lunar dawn and hurled its message toward Jupiter . And once again she watched the familiarscenes and listened to the old interviews aboard Discovery . Why was she watching ? It was all stored somewhere in the home archives ( though she never played it back when Jose wasARTHUR C. CLARKE * 162 f 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 163around ) . Perhaps she was expecting some news flash ; she did not like to admit , even to herself , how much power the past still held over her emotions . And there was Dave , as she had expected . It was an old BBC interview , of which she knew almost every word . He was talking about Hal , trying to decide whether the computer was self-consciousor not . How young he looked  --  how different from those last blurred images from the doomed Discovery ! And how much like Bobby as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with tears . No  --  something was wrong with the set , or the channel . Both sound and image were behaving erratically . Dave 's lips were moving , but she could hear nothing . Then his face seemed to dissolve , to melt into blocks of color . It reformed , blurred again , and then was steady once more . But there was still no sound . Where had they got this picture ? This was not Dave as a man , but as a boy  --  as she had known him first . He was looking out of the screen almost as if he could see her across the gulf of years . He smiled ; his lips moved . " Hello , Betty , " he said . It was not hard to form the words , and to impose them on the currents pulsing in the audio circuits . The real difficulty was to slow down his thoughts to the glacial tempo of the human brain . And then to have to wait an eternity for the answer .. . Betty Fernandez was tough ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a housewife for a dozen years , she had not forgotten her training as an electronics serviceperson . This was just another of the medium 's countless miracles of simulation ; she would accept it now , and worry about the details later . " Dave , " she answered . " Dave  --  is that really you ? " " I am not sure , " replied the image on the screen , in a curiouslytoneless voice . " But I remember Dave Bowman , and everythingabout him . " " Is he dead ? " Now that was another difficult question . " His body  --  yes . But that is no longer important . All that Dave Bowman really was , is still part of me . " Betty crossed herself  --  that was a gesture she had learned from Jose  --  and whispered : " You mean  --  you 're a spirit ? " " I do not know a better word . " " Why have you returned ? " Ah ! Betty  --  why indeed ! I wish you could tell me .. . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TV screen . The divorce between body and mind was still far from complete , and not even the most complaisant of the cable networkswould have transmitted the blatantly sexual images that were forming there now . Betty watched for a little while , sometimes smiling , sometimesshocked . Then she turned away , not through shame but sadness  --  regret for lost delights . " So it 's not true , " she said , " what they always told us about angels . " Am I an angel ? he wondered . But at least he understood what he was doing there , swept back by the tides of sorrow and desire to a rendezvous with his past . The most powerful emotion he had ever known had been his passion for Betty ; the elements of grief and guilt it contained only made it stronger . She had never told him if he was a better lover than Bobby ; that was one question he had never asked , for that would have broken the spell . They had clung to the same illusion , sought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been  --  still only seventeenwhen it had started , barely two years after the funeral ! ) a balm for the same wound . Of course , it could not last , but the experience had left him irrevocably changed . For more than a decade , all his autoerotic fantasies had centered upon Betty ; he had never found another woman to compare with her , and long ago had realized that he never would . No one else was haunted by the same beloved ghost . The images of desire faded from the screen ; for a moment , the regular program broke through , with an incongruous shot ofARTHUR C. CLARKE* 164Leonov hanging above Io . Then Dave Bowman 's face reappeared . He seemed to be losing control , for its lineaments were wildly unstable . Sometimes he would seem only ten years old  --  then twenty or thirty  --  then , incredibly , a wizened mummy whose wrinkled features were a parody of the man she had once known . " I have one more question before I go . Carlos  --  you always said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was the truth ? " Betty Fernandez stared for one long , last time into the eyes of the boy she had once loved ( he was eighteen again , and for a moment she wished she could see his entire body , not merely his face ) . " He was your son , David , " she whispered . The image faded ; the normal service resumed . When , almost an hour later , Jose Fernandez came quietly into the room , Betty was still staring at the screen . She did not turn around as he kissed her on the back of the neck . " You 'll never believe this , Jose . " " Try me . " " I 've just lied to a ghost . " 34 . VALEDICTIONWHEN THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF AERONAUTICS AND ASTROnauticspublished its controversial summary Fifty Years of UFOs in 1997 , many critics pointed out that unidentified flying objects had been observed for centuries , and that Kenneth Arnold 's " Flying Saucer " sighting of 1947 had countless precedents . People had been seeing strange things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the mid-twentieth century , UFOs were a random phenomenon of no general interest . After that date , they became a matter of public and scientific concern , and the basis for what could only be called religious beliefs . The reason was not far to seek ; the arrival of the giant rocket and the dawn of the Space Age had turned men 's minds to other worlds . Realization that the human race would soon be able to leave the planet of its birth prompted the inevitable questions : Where 's everyone , and when may we expect visitors ? There was also the hope , though it was seldom spelled out in as many 165ARTHUR C. CLARKE * 166 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 167words , that benevolent creatures from the stars might help mankindheal its numerous self-inflicted wounds and save it from future disasters . Any student of psychology could have predicted that so profounda need would be swiftly satisfied . During the last half of the twentieth century , there were literally thousands of reports of spacecraft sightings from every part of the globe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " close encounters "  --  actualmeetings with extraterrestrial visitors , frequently embellishedby tales of celestial joyrides , abductions , and even honeymoons in space . The fact that , over and over again , these were demonstrated to be lies or hallucinations did nothing to deter the faithful . Men who had been shown cities on the far side of the Moon lost little credibility even when Orbiter surveysand Apollo missions revealed no artifacts of any kind ; ladies who married Venusians were still believed when that planet , sadly , turned out to be hotter than molten lead . By the time the AIAA published its report no reputable scientist  --  evenamong those few who had once espoused the idea  --  believed that UFOs had any connection with extraterrestrial life or intelligence . Of course , it would never be possible to prove that ; any one of those myriad sightings , over the last thousand years , might have been the real thing . But as time went by , and satellite cameras and radars scanning the entire heavens producedno concrete evidence , the general public lost interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not discouraged , but kept the faith with their newsletters and books , most of them regurgitatingand embellishing old reports long after they had been discredited or exposed . When the discovery of the Tycho monolith  --  TMA-1  --  was finallyannounced , there was a chorus of " I told you so 's ! " It could no longer be denied that there had been visitors to the Moon  --  and presumably to the Earth as well  --  a little matter of three million years ago . At once , UFOs infested the heavens again ; though it was odd that the three independent national tracking systems , which could locate anything in space larger than a ball-point pen , were still unable to find them . Rather quickly , the number of reports dropped down to the " noise level " once more  --  the figure that would be expected , merely as a result of the many astronomical , meteorological , and aeronautical phenomena constantly occurring in the skies . But now it had started all over again . This time , there was no mistake ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth . Sightings were reported within minutes of the warning from Leonov ; the first close encounters were only a few hours later . A retired stockbroker , walking his bulldog on the Yorkshire Moors , was astonished when a disk-shaped craft landed beside him and the occupant  --  quite human , except for the pointed ears  --  asked the way to Downing Street . The contactee was so surprised that he was only able to wave his stick in the general direction of Whitehall ; conclusive proof of the meeting was provided by the fact that the bulldog now refused to take his food . Although the stockbroker had no previous history of mental illness , even those who believed him had some difficulty in acceptingthe next report . This time it was a Basque shepherd on a traditional mission ; he was greatly relieved when what he had feared to be border guards turned out to be a couple of cloaked men with piercing eyes , who wanted to know the way to the United Nations Headquarters . They spoke perfect Basque  --  an excruciatingly difficult tongue with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the space visitors were remarkable linguists , even if their geography was oddly deficient . So it went on , case after case . Very few of the contactees were actually lying or insane ; most of them sincerely believed their own stories , and retained that belief even under hypnosis . And some were just victims of practical jokes or improbable accidents  --  likethe unlucky amateur archeologists who found the props that a celebrated science-fiction moviemaker had abandonedin the Tunisian desert almost four decades earlier . Yet only at the beginning  --  and at the very end  --  was any humanbeing genuinely aware of his presence ; and that was because he so desired it . The world was his to explore and examine as he pleased , without restraint or hindrance . No walls could keep him out , noARTHUR C. CLARKE * 168 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 169secrets could be hidden from the senses he possessed . At first he believed that he was merely fulfilling old ambitions , by visiting the places he had never seen in that earlier existence . Not until much later did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the globe had a deeper purpose . In some subtle way , he was being used as a probe , sampling every aspect of human affairs . The control was so tenuous that he was barely conscious of it ; he was rather like a hunting dog on a leash , allowed to make excursions of his own , yet neverthelesscompelled to obey the overriding wishes of his master . The pyramids , the Grand Canyon , the moon-washed snows of Everest  --  these were choices of his own . So were some art galleriesand concert halls ; though he would certainly , on his own initiative , never have endured the whole of the Ring . Nor would he have visited so many factories , prisons , hospitals , a nasty little war in Asia , a racecourse , a complicated orgy in Beverly Hills , the Oval Room of the White House , the Kremlinarchives , the Vatican Library , the sacred Black Stone of the Ka'bah at Mecca .. . There were also experiences of which he had no clear memory , as if they had been censored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guardian angel . For exampleWhat was he doing at the Leakey Memorial Museum , in 01-duvai Gorge ? He had no greater interest in the origin of Man than any other intelligent member of the species H. sapiens , and fossils meant nothing to him . Yet the famous skulls , guarded like crown jewels in their display cases , aroused strange echoes in his memory , and an excitement for which he was unable to account . There was a feeling of deja vu stronger than any he had ever known ; the place should be familiar  --  but something was wrong . It was like a house to which one returns after many years , to find that all the furniture has been changed , the walls moved , and even the stairways rebuilt . It was bleak , hostile terrain , dry and parched . Where were the lush plains and the myriad fleet-footed herbivores that had roamed across them , three million years ago ? Three million years . How had he known that ? No answer came from the echoing silence into which he hadthrown the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before him , a familiar black rectangular shape . He approached , and a shadowy image appeared in its depths , like a reflection in a pool of ink . The sad and puzzled eyes that stared back from beneath that hairy , receding forehead looked beyond him into a future they could never see . For he was that future , a hundred thousand generations further down the stream of time . History had begun there ; that at least he now understood . But how  --  and above all , why  --  were secrets still withheld from him ? But there was one last duty , and that was hardest of all . He was still sufficiently human to put it off until the very end . Now what 's she up to ? the duty nurse asked herself , zooming the TV monitor onto the old lady . She 's tried lots of tricks , but this is the first time I 've seen her talking to her hearing aid , for goodness ' sake . I wonder what she 's saying ? The microphone was not sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to matter . Jessie Bowman had seldom looked so peaceful and content . Though her eyes were closed , her entire face was wreathed in an almost angelic smile while her lips continued to form whispered words . And then the watcher saw something that she tried hard to forget , because to report it would instantly disqualify her in the nursing profession . Slowly and jerkily , the comb lying on the bedside table raised itself in the air as if lifted by clumsy , invisiblefingers . On the first attempt , it missed ; then , with obvious difficulty , it began to part the long silver strands , pausing sometimes to disentanglea knot . Jessie Bowman was not speaking now , but she continued to smile . The comb was moving with more assurance , and no longer in abrupt , uncertain jerks . How long it lasted the nurse could never be certain . Not until the comb was gently replaced on the table did she recover from her paralysis . Ten-year-old Dave Bowman had finished the chore which heARTHUR C. CLARKE * 170always hated but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now ageless had gained his first control of obdurate matter . Jessie Bowman was still smiling when the nurse finally came to investigate . She had been too scared to hurry ; but it would have made no difference anyway. 35 . REHABILITATIONTHE UPROAR OF EARTH WAS COMFORTABLY MUTED , ACROSS THEmillions of kilometers of space . Leonov 's crew watched , with fascination yet with a certain detachment , the debates in the United Nations , the interviews with distinguished scientists , the theorizing of the news commentators , the matter-of-fact yet wildly conflicting accounts of the UFO contactees . They could contribute nothing to the brouhaha , for they had witnessed no further manifestations of any kind . Zagadka , alias Big Brother , remained as blankly indifferent to their presence as ever . And that was indeed an ironic situation ; they had come all the way from Earth to solve a mystery  --  and it looked as if the answer might be right back at their starting point . For the first time , they felt grateful for the slow velocity of light , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jupiter circuit . Even so , Floyd was badgered by so many media requests that he finally went on strike . Nothing* 171ARTHUR C. CLARKE * 172 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 173more remained to be said , and he had said it at least a dozen times . Besides , there was still much work to be done . Leonov had to be prepared for the long journey home , so that it would be ready to depart immediately when the launch window opened . The timing was not at all critical ; even if they missed by a month , that would merely prolong the trip . Chandra , Curnow , and Floyd would not even notice as they slept their way toward the Sun ; but the rest of the crew was grimly determined to leave just as soon as the laws of celestial mechanics permitted . Discovery still posed many problems . The ship had barely sufficientpropellant for the return to Earth , even if it left much later than Leonov and flew a minimum-energy orbit  --  which would take almost three years . And this would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry out the mission with no human intervention except long-range monitoring . Without his cooperation , Discovery would have to be abandoned once again . It had been fascinating  --  indeed , deeply moving  --  to watch the steady regrowth of Hal 's personality , from brain-damaged child to puzzled adolescent and at length to slightly condescending adult . Although he knew that such anthropomorphic labels were highly misleading , Floyd found it quite impossible to avoid them . And there were times when he felt that the whole situation had a haunting familiarity . How often he had seen videodramas in which disturbed youngsters were straightened out by all-wise descendants of the legendary Sigmund Freud ! Essentially the same story was being played out in the shadow of Jupiter . The electronic psychoanalysis had proceeded at a speed totallybeyond human comprehension as repair and diagnostic programs flashed through Hal 's circuits at billions of bits a second , pinpointing possible malfunctions and correcting them . Though most of these programs had been tested in advance on Hal 's twin , SAL 9000 , the impossibility of a real-time dialog between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasted when it proved necessary to check back with Earth at a critical point in the therapy . For despite all Chandra 's work , the computer 's rehabilitation was still far from complete . Hal exhibited numerous idiosyncrasiesand nervous tics , sometimes even ignoring spoken words  --  though he would always acknowledge keyboard inputs from anyone . In the reverse direction , his outputs were even more eccentric . There were times when he would give verbal replies , but would not display them visually . At other times he would do both  --  but refused to print hard copy . He would give no excuses or explanations  --  not even the stubbornly impenetrable " I prefer not to " of Melville 's autistic scrivener , Bartleby . However , he was not actively disobedient so much as reluctant , and only where certain tasks were concerned . It was alwayspossible to win his cooperation eventually  --  " to talk him out of his sulk , " as Curnow put it neatly . It was not surprising that Dr. Chandra was beginning to show the strain . On one celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost lost his temper . " Is it true , Dr. Chandra , that you chose the name Hal to be one step ahead of IBM ? " " Utter nonsense ! Half of us come from IBM and we 've been trying to stamp out that story for years . I thought that by now every intelligent person knew that H-A-L is derived from HeuristicALgorithmic . " Afterward , Max swore that he could distinctly hear the capital letters . In Floyd 's private opinion , the odds were at least fifty to one against flying Discovery safely back to Earth . And then Chandra came to him with an extraordinary proposal . " Dr. Floyd , can I have a word with you ? " After all the weeks and shared experiences , Chandra was still as formal as ever  --  not only to Floyd , but to all the crew . He would not even address the ship 's baby , Zenia , without the prefix " ma'am . " " Of course , Chandra . What is it ? " " I 've virtually completed the programing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orbit . Five have now been run on a simulation , without any problems . " ARTHUR C. CLARKE * 174 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 175 " Excellent . I 'm sure that no one else on Earth  --  in the Solar System  --  could have done it . " " Thank you . However , you know as well as I do that it 's impossible to program for every eventuality . Hal may  --  will  --  functionperfectly , and will be able to handle any reasonable emergency . But all sorts of trivial accidents  --  minor equipment failures that could be fixed with a screwdriver , broken wires , stuck switches  --  could leave him helpless and abort the whole mission . " " You 're absolutely right , of course , and it 's been worrying me . But what can we do about it ? " " It 's really quite simple . I 'd like to stay with Discovery . " Floyd 's immediate reaction was that Chandra had gone crazy . On second thought , perhaps he was only half crazy . It might indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human being  --  that superb all-purpose troubleshooting and repair device  --  aboard Discovery for the long voyage back to Earth . But the objections were completely overwhelming . " It 's an interesting idea , " Floyd answered with extreme caution , " and I certainly appreciate your enthusiasm . But have you thought of all the problems ? " That was a silly thing to say ; Chandra would have all the answers already filed away for immediateretrieval . " You 'll be on your own for over three years ! Suppose you had an accident or a medical emergency ? " " That 's a risk I 'm prepared to take . " " And what about food , water ? Leonov does n't have enough to spare . " " I 've checked Discovery 's recycling system ; it can be made operational again without too much difficulty . Besides , we Indianscan manage on very little . " It was unusual for Chandra to refer to his origins , or indeed to make any personal statements ; his " true confession " was the only example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim ; Curnow had once remarked that Dr. Chandra had the sort of physique that could only be achieved by centuries of starvation . Although it sounded like one of the engineer 's unkinderwisecracks , it had been made entirely without malice  --  indeed , with sympathy ; though not , of course , in Chandra 's hearing . " Well , we still have several weeks to decide . I 'll think it over and talk to Washington . " " Thank you ; do you mind if I start making the arrangements ? " " Er  --  not at all , as long as they do n't interfere with the existing plans . Remember  --  Mission Control will have to make the final decision . " And I know exactly what Mission Control will say . It was madness to expect a man to survive in space for three years , alone . But , of course , Chandra had always been alone. 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 177were interested in Mankind . They had tapped and stored his memories , for their own inscrutable purposes . And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes with his cooperation , sometimes without . He did not resent that ; indeed , the very processing he had experienced made such childish reactions impossible . He was beyond love and hate and desire and fear  --  but he had not forgottenthem , and could still understand how they ruled the world of which he had once been part . Was that the purpose of the exercise ? If so , for what ultimate goal ? He had become a player in a game of gods , and must learn the rules as he went along. 36 . FIRE IN THE DEEPEARTH WAS ALREADY FAR BEHIND , AND THE AWESOME WONDERS OFthe Jovian system were expanding swiftly before him , when he had his revelation . How could he have been so blind  --  so stupid ! It was as if he had been walking in his sleep ; now he was starting to awaken . Who are you ? he cried . What do you want ? Why have you done this to me ? There was no answer , yet he was certain that he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even as a man can tell , though his eyes are tightly shut , that he is in a closed room and not some empty , open space . Around him there was the faint echo of a vast mentality , an implacable will . He called again into the reverberant silence , and again there was no direct reply  --  only that sense of watchful companionship . Very well ; he would find the answers for himself . Some were obvious ; whoever or whatever they were , they 176The jagged rocks of the four tiny outer moons Sinope , Pasiphae , Carme , and Ananke flickered briefly across his field of consciousness ; then came Elara , Lysithea , Himalia , and Leda at half their distance from Jupiter . He ignored them all ; now the pock-marked face of Callisto lay ahead . Once , twice he orbited the battered globe , larger than Earth 's own Moon , while senses of which he had been unaware probed its outer layers of ice and dust . His curiosity was quickly satisfied ; this world was a frozen fossil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , must have come close to shattering it . One hemisphere was a giant bull's-eye , a series of concentric rings where solid rock had once flowed in kilometer-high ripplesunder some ancient hammer blow from space . Seconds later , he was circling Ganymede . Now there was a far more complex and interesting world ; though so near to Callisto , and almost the same size , it presented an utterly different appearance . There were , it was true , numerous craters  --  but most of them seemed to have been , quite literally , ploughed back into the ground . The most extraordinary feature of the Ganymedean landscape was the presence of meandering stripes , built up from scores of parallel furrows a few kilometers apart . This grooved terrain looked as if it had been produced by armies of intoxicatedploughmen , weaving back and forth across the face of the satellite . In a few revolutions , he saw more of Ganymede than all theARTHUR C. CLARKE * 178 2010 : ODYSSEY TWO * 179space probes ever sent from Earth , and filed away the knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he was sure of that , though he did not know why  --  any more than he understood the impulse that was now driving him so purposefully from world to world . As , presently , it brought him to Europa . Though he was still largely a passive spectator , he was aware now of a rising interest , a focusing of attention  --  a concentration of will . Even if he was a puppet in the hands of an unseen and uncommunicative master , some of the thoughts of that controlling influence leaked  --  or were allowed to leak  --  into his own mind . The smooth , intricately patterned globe now rushing toward him bore little resemblance either to Ganymede or Callisto . It looked organic ; the network of lines branching and intersecting over its entire surface was uncannily like a world-spanning system of veins and arteries . The endless ice fields of a frigid waste , far colder than the Antarctic , stretched beneath him . Then , with brief surprise , he saw that he was passing over the wreckage of a spaceship . He recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the video newscasts he had analyzed . Not now  --  not now  --  there would be ample opportunity later .. . Then he was through the ice , and into a world as unknown to his controllers as to himself . It was an ocean world , its hidden waters protected from the vacuumof space by a crust of ice . In most places the ice was kilometersthick , but there were lines of weakness where it had cracked open and torn apart . Then there had been a brief battle between two implacably hostile elements that came into direct contact on no other world in the Solar System . The war between Sea and Space always ended in the same stalemate ; the exposed water simultaneouslyboiled and froze , repairing the armor of ice . The seas of Europa would have frozen completely solid long ago without the influence of nearby Jupiter . Its gravity continuallykneaded the core of the little world ; the forces that convulsedIo were working there , though with much less ferocity . As he skimmed across the face of the deep , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satellite . And he both heard and felt it , in the continual roar and thunder of submarine earthquakes , the hiss of escaping gases from the interior , the infrasonic pressure waves of avalanches sweeping over the abyssal plains . By comparison with the tumultuousocean that covered Europa , even the noisy seas of Earth were silent . He had not lost his sense of wonder , and the first oasis filled him with delighted surprise . It extended for almost a kilometer around a tangled mass of pipes and chimneys deposited by mineralbrines gushing from the interior . Out of that natural parody of a Gothic castle , black , scalding liquids pulsed in a slow rhythm , as if driven by the beating of some mighty heart . And , like blood , they were the authentic sign of life itself . The boiling fluids drove back the deadly cold leaking down from above , and formed an island of warmth on the seabed . Equally important , they brought from Europa 's interior all the chemicals of life . There , in an environment where none had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet it should have been expected ; he remembered that , only a lifetime ago , such fertile oases had been discovered in the deep oceans of Earth . Here they were present on an immensely larger scale , and in far greater variety . In the tropical zone close to the contorted walls of the " castle " were delicate , spidery structures that seemed to be the analogy of plants , though almost all were capable of movement . Crawlingamong these were bizarre slugs and worms , some feeding on the plants , others obtaining their food directly from the mineralladenwaters around them . At greater distances from the source of heat  --  the submarine fire around which all the creatures warmed themselves  --  were sturdier , more robust organisms , not unlike crabs or spiders . Armies of biologists could have spent lifetimes studying that one small oasis . Unlike the Paleozoic terrestrial seas , it was not a stable environment , so evolution had progressed swiftly here , producing multitudes of fantastic forms . And they were all underindefinite stay of execution ; sooner or later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forces that powered it moved their focus elsewhere.
