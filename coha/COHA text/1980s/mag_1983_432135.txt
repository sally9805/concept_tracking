 | At high noon on June 14 , Pan American Flight 801 is scheduled to take off from New York for Taiwan ? but it will have to weather a political storm to get there . Pan Am already flies to China and plans to become the first American carrier to land at both Peking and Taipei . But to Peking 's suspicious leaders , the new service ? following a year of quarrels between the United States and the People 's Republic over arms sales to Taiwan and a number of economic issues ? seems like yet another example of a return to a two-China policy . Only two years ago , China hailed the resumption of U.S.-Peking air service after a 32-year suspension as the creation of a " sky bridge of Chinese-American friendship . " But the Chinese have formally warned the United States that the flight of Pan Am 801 would have " severe repercussions " on SinoAmerican relations . Pan Am says its only interest is economic . When the airline halted service to Taiwan in order to secure Chinese approval for flights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and business traffic . But no : competitors say its two round trips a week are only one-third full and real money losers . " For an airline that is already bleeding red ink , " says the Peking representative of a rival Western carrier , " that can only be bad news . " Even Pan Am says the flights are only marginally profitable . The U.S.-Taiwan run looks much more lucrative : the thousands of Taiwanese students attending American universities and the record $13.3 billion bilateral trade last year ensure a steady stream of passengers . " Pan Am does not have a two-China policy , " said one Pan Am official in Peking . " As far as we 're concerned , flying to Taipei is just like flying to Cleveland . It 's a place where we can make a buck . " The U.S. government 's only part in Pan Am 's plan was routine approval by the Civil Aeronautics Board , which was granted after consultation with the State Department ? normal procedure for an international route . But , says the airline official , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag carrier " no matter how many times I tell them we are not . " The Chinese sent a letter to the CAB warning that the future " smooth operation " of the Sino-American Civil Air Transport Agreement of 1980 will be endangered if Pan Am goes ahead with service to Taiwan . Bicker , Bicker : In the worst case , China could suspend Pan Am 's landing rights . Last April , when KLM began service from Amsterdam to Taipei , Peking retaliated by revoking KLM 's emergency-landing rights at Canton . China might also block Northwest Orient Airlines from starting cargo service to the mainland planned for sometime in the next year . Either action would probably force Washington to invoke similar sanctions against China 's CAAC airline . But Peking may feel pressured to take some strong action because airlines all over the world are watching the Pan Am case closely . Japan Air Lines , which has had to use a subsidiary , Japan Asia Airways , for the Taiwan run , has said it will resume service to Taiwan under its own name if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European airlines would like to follow suit , according to industry sources . Heavy traffic to and from Taipei would help ease Taiwan 's isolation ? exactly what Peking does n't want .
