But can the state swallow it ? <P> " At first I could n't believe it , " says St. Louis School Board Staffer Eugene Uram . " Then I thought , ' What a lovely , creative idea . ' " <P> What intrigued Uram was a plan put forth by the Reagan Administration and the school board to integrate schools in St. Louis ( where 79% of pupils are black ) and surrounding suburbs ( 84% white ) . Instead of compulsory cross-district busing , they proposed to offer a remarkable reward to suburban whites who voluntarily enroll in some city schools and to city blacks who choose to transfer to mostly white schools . The Administration and the school board asked U.S. District Judge William Hungate to require the state of Missouri to pay college tuition for pupils who voluntarily transfer to increase integration : one semester of free college education at any of Missouri 's 30 public campuses in return for each year of participation in the program from kindergarten through twelfth grade . Says Craig Crenshaw , the Justice Department attorney who originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrot .

" <P> The financially pressed Missouri government is anything but happy , claiming it can not fund the tuition plan , which is likely to cost $6 million or more a year . Says Missouri Attorney General John Ashcroft : " The bankruptcy of the Justice Department 's argument shows that they have nothing to offer but the state 's own money . " There was concern as well that the plan was unfair to students who did not transfer . For example , white students who come into a black classroom would get college scholarships for being there , while black classmates in the very same room would have no special incentives . <P> Judge Hungate 's ruling is not expected for several weeks . Meanwhile , Justice Department experts in Washington note that compulsory busing between St. Louis and its suburbs would also be expensive . There is now no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis plan is very much an experiment , and it might not work . Yet it is clear that integration needs new approaches . Observes School Expert James Coleman , a busing critic : " One of the problems with desegregation plans in general is that they have been punitive . Children and their families have ordinarily not received any benefit , and they 've borne the total cost . "
