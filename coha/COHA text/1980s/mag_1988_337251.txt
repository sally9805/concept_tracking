Encouraged by applause , the teenage performer runs off to the big city . But his early popularity vanishes as quickly as it arrived . Increasingly isolated and destitute , he takes a chemical overdose and dies before his 18th birthday . Only then is his talent recognized . <P> This prototype of the self-annihilating artist seems yet another casualty of the rock culture ; in fact , Thomas Chatterton perished in a London garret in 1770 . Pondering the tragedy , William Wordsworth labeled him " the marvellous boy , " and Samuel Johnson burbled , " It is wonderful how the whelp has written such things . " Not all the appraisal was so rhapsodic . Horace Walpole called Chatterton " an instance that a complete genius and a complete rogue can be formed before a man is of age . " Genius because Chatterton 's verses were so prodigious , rogue because the young poet once wrote in an archaic style , artificially aged the paper , then claimed to have discovered the works of a bogus 15th century monk . <P> Ambition and false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredients of high romance , and it is no wonder that investigators periodically ransack the material of Chatterton 's brief career . The latest is Briton Peter Ackroyd , 38 , biographer of T.S . Eliot and a novelist who specializes in the blending of history and imagination . In Hawksmoor he shuttled between the 18th century and the present . Chatterton ventures deeper ! into the time warp . It unfolds in contemporary England , concludes in the late 1700s and dallies in the Victorian epoch when an artist named Henry Wallis painted a dramatic portrait , now in the Tate Gallery , of the poet as a young corpse . The model for Chatterton was also an apprentice writer : George Meredith . Not long afterward , Wallis ran off with Meredith 's wife Mary Ellen . <P> This tumult of passion , literature and coincidence belongs in the Dickensian tradition , and so does Ackroyd . The protagonist of his crowded and exuberant novel is another cursed poet , Charles Wychwood . One afternoon he comes across an old painting showing the marvellous boy as a middle-aged man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manuscripts . They suggest that Chatterton faked his early death , then continued to write more verse under more assumed names , among them William Blake and Thomas Gray . " The greatest plagiarist in history ? " inquires a colleague . " No ! " Wychwood argues . " He was the greatest poet in history ! " <P> Or the greatest con artist . Throughout the narrative , nothing is as it seems . Wychwood 's employer is an author who , it turns out , has plagiarized her books . His wife works for an art gallery where the paintings are palpable forgeries . Meanwhile , as the narrative flashes forward and back , parallel lies are occurring in other times and places . Meredith is being deceived ; so are those who subscribe to the Chatterton myth . <P> Ackroyd sometimes overstates his satire of scholarship and art  --  Chatterton 's death by poison comes not out of despair but in the hope of finding a cure for the clap . Yet the poet himself is a poignant re-creation , and the supporting cast of irrepressible eccentrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On a train , Wychwood literally devours a novel , rolling the pages into balls and popping them into his mouth .
