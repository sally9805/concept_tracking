' ' Less is more . There ' s almost a direct correlation between starting with a lot of money and failure , ' ' says the Los Angeles-based small-business consultant . His firm , Kessler &; Associates , works with some 750 clients. // // Indeed , the annals of corporate America are packed with meager beginnings : // *In 1973 , Leone Ackerly bought $7 worth of cleaning materials and a mop . Then she started scrubbing . Her hands-on research produced a fast , thorough residential cleaning system which she dubbed Mini-Maid International of Marietta , Ga. // ' ' We made a profit from day one , ' ' Mrs. Ackerly boasts . Her 111 franchises cleaned up with $11 million in sales last year. // *Elmer Doolin , the founder of Frito-Lay , bought the recipe for Fritos corn chips for $100 .

Still , little or no capital can be a blessing , says Jeffry A. Timmons , professor of entrepreneurship at Babson College in Wellesley , Mass . ' ' I ' ve seen more people making a muck of things when they had a lot of money. ' ' // Experts say an abundance of cash tempts people to start enterprises that are bigger and more complex than they can handle . Often just learning the ropes of dealing with suppliers and customers , and the chores of marketing , production , and accounting , are enough to keep novices busy. // Starting out with little money makes an initial flop easier to recover from .

' ' <> <> How zucchini butter spread // Having insufficent funds often ensures a proper incubation period for premature products , forestalling failure on a large scale . Kessler cites two Orange County , Calif. , women who were looking for $30 , 000 to buy a large machine to manufacture their home-brewed zucchini butter . Instead , he directed the women to the local supermarket . They asked the store manager for permission to give away samples of their zucchini butter on crackers . They promised to sell no product , just entertain the customers. // Dressed in gingham skirts and bonnets , the two women doled out samples for two weeks . Customer reactions produced several crucial changes in the recipe . But by the third week , people were eager to buy the butter . The two refused to take orders . They simply told all comers : ' ' Talk to the store manager. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contacted a food broker . A manufacturer was found to produce the butter . And the local store paid for the first order . The women put up no money . Within two years , they sold their rights to the product for more than $100 , 000. // But what if plenty of cash is readily available ? Many banks are courting small businesses more aggressively , since larger concerns can get better interest rates elsewhere . Don ' t take the loan , even from friends or relatives , says Kessler. // Why ? Entrepreneurs often make overambitious sales projections . ' ' Taking a loan can put you on an unrealistic time schedule . You make commitments you can ' t keep , ' ' Kessler says . ' ' When the loan starts to come due , your attention span shortens . You worry about the banker instead of your customers . You start working defensively , working longer hours , and giving short shrift to creativity . Your thinking is all wrong.

If you lack a manufacturer , office or storage space , just ask for it . Talk to local business owners , says Kessler. // ' ' Don ' t ask how much it is , ask how you can get it for free , ' ' he says . He suggests offering your services in return , or paying for the space once your business is off the ground. // Why would someone give office space away ? // Many business owners have an excess , ' ' and it builds their egos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has found that successful people enjoy offering advice and space to a budding entrepreneur . And those relationships can be more valuable than capital . Kessler has started a capacity-exchange program in Los Angeles. // Zenas Block , a New York University management professor , agrees with many of Kessler ' s concepts . But Mr. Block says a thin wallet can be a recipe for disaster . Indeed , ' ' lack of capital ' ' was cited as the primary reason for failure by nearly half of small-business owners surveyed in a Minolta/Gallup poll that was released on March 4. // ' ' If your business grows rapidly , and you can ' t finance your growth , success can ruin you , ' ' Block says. // But Kessler contends that having too little money forces a business not to grow too fast .
