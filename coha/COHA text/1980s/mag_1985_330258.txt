Ralph and Ed . Kramden and Norton . The names are permanently linked together and set in that perfectly drab , 1950s New York City apartment occupied by The Honeymooners . Jackie Gleason , 69 , and Art Carney , 66 , reprised their famous roles once for a TV special seven years ago , but they have not otherwise worked together . Explains Gleason : " The only way Art and I could do something , to play characters who were not the Honeymooners , was if we did real people . " This month they got their chance . They are filming a TV movie about two famed undercover Prohibition agents , Izzy Einstein and Moe Smith . The two ham it up in the disguises used by the flamboyant peace officers , though no one pretends the parts will supplant their earlier incarnations . Ralph , by the way , plays Izzy , and Ed plays Moe.
