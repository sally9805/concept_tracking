HEARTBEAT The Healthy Heart Report Twenty-eight third graders bounded into the music room of Crooked Creek Elementary School under the watchful eyes of their teacher , Barbara Applegate , and their principal , Norm Foust . It was 10:30 a.m. , and this was the part of the morning they had anticipated . They divided into clusters of seven ; then they dropped to their knees and en  --  circled their " victim . " " Do you remember what you do first ? " a woman dressed in hospital whites asked . " Send for help , " a serious eight  --  year-old named Heather piped up . " Call 911 . " " And then ? " " Check to see if her heart is beat  --  ing and if she 's breathing , " replied a little boy in a T-shirt with the message " Growing with Riley . " The T-shirt is a tip-off why the students are so savvy in matters of the heart . Riley , in this case , is the James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Chil  --  dren in Indianapolis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Part  --  ners in Education " program that pro  --  vides hospital tours and special speakers for the kids , CPR training for the teachers , and the pooling of efforts for the hospital 's annual telethon . Because of Crooked Creek 's interest in good health , its third graders were asked if they would like to participate in CPR-awareness classes sponsored by the Children 's Better Health Institute ( CBHI ) . Their response ? A resounding yes . Four half-hour sessions were designed to introduce the students to Resusci Anne , the lifelike mannequin used in CPR training , and to teach them how to respond to an emergency . " Work as a team , " cautioned Chris Kutruff , R.N. , who oversaw the group practicing on Resusci Baby . " Does anyone have a baby sister or brother at home ? " Three hands shot up in response . " I have a little cousin named Shan  --  non , " one volunteer replied . " O.K. , " Chris said . " Now let 's pretend that this is Shannon and she needs help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the children 's touch became noticeably more gentle . Increasing Heart Awareness Programs such as those sponsored by Riley Hospital and the CBHI are typical of current efforts to increase heart awareness among children . Re  --  cent studies have shown heart disease present in preschoolers as young as age 3 , and one-third of all youngsters 2 to 18 years old are estimated to have elevated cholesterol levels . The pres  --  sure is on adults to make kids " heart smart " about health factors kids can control . These controllable factors in  --  clude blood cholesterol , blood pres  --  sure , and weight , as well as tobacco use . Teachers , parents , and the medi  --  cal community are looking for inno  --  vative ways to promote prevention and advocate abstinence from fatty foods , cigarettes , and other habit-forming offenders . " School districts are not sitting by idly and watching their students ' fu  --  tures go up in smoke , " says Thomas Shannon , executive director of the National School Boards Association . The NSBA has set an objective of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its accomplish  --  ment , 95 percent of all school districts in the country have written policies limiting tobacco smoking in the schools . Many of these same schools are introducing CPR into their health curriculums and introducing high-fiber and low-fat menus to their foods and nutrition classes . Among elementary school students , diet modification  --  replacing eggs with whole-grain cereal and trading hot dogs for turkey clubs  --  is the first step in altering what doctors call " lifestyle factors . " " A strong case can be made for the prevention of atherosclerosis , even in childhood , " says Frank A. Franklin , a researcher at Louisiana State Uni  --  versity . The Bogalusa Heart Study , a long-term project of LSU that fo  --  cuses on heart disease in children , has indicated that cholesterol levels can be projected from childhood into adulthood . A certain measurement usually retains the same rank order as a youngster ages ; a child with a high blood cholesterol level is at greaterrisk for a high level in the future . And of course high cholesterol levels are a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high " ? At birth , the blood cholesterol level generally is around 70 . It increases steadily from then on . The American Health Foun  --  dation considers a level of 140 to 150 mg/dl to be safe for children . Though there is n't a consensus , a moderately high level is thought to range from 176 to 199 , and any measurement ex  --  ceeding 200 would be considered ex  --  tremely high . The American Heart Association and the American Acad  --  emy of Pediatrics have several sensi  --  ble recommendations for managing high cholesterol levels in children . ? If the cholesterol level is normal , good health practices are suggested : plenty of exercise , a moderate diet , and no smoking . The cholesterol test should be repeated in three years . ? For moderately elevated choles  --  terol levels , children should lower their intake of dietary fat with the goal of bringing the total cholesterol level below 170 . Annual tests should be scheduled . ? For high cholesterol levels , mod  --  ifying the diet is urgent . The entire family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet . By correcting eating habits , chil  --  dren can reduce their cholesterol Using the adult-size mannequin , children practice CPR under the supervision of an emergency medical technician . They are learning where to place their hands and how much pressure to exert . Most eight  --  year-olds have enough strength to cir  --  culate the blood in an adult . HE/ WFBEAT levels by 10 to 15 percent . And they can cut calories and trim excessive weight , another contributor to heart disease . " Obesity adds to whatever your genetic cholesterol predisposition is , " LSU 's Frank Franklin explains . Unfortunately , obesity among chil  --  dren is on the upswing . Between 1963 and 1980 , it increased 54 percent in youngsters aged 8 to 11 , and 39 per  --  cent in teens aged 12 to 17 . Linked to this surge in weight gain was a loss of interest in exercise . As of 1984 , fewer than 60 percent of youths aged 10 to 18 were getting the minimum amount of exercise needed for healthy hearts . No matter what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have everything to gain by reducing the amount of fat in the family 's diet . The calories of typical American diets are 40 percent or more fat ; 30 percent would be much better for the arteries at any age . The basic elements of a healthful diet for children over two and their parents are well-known : fish , poultry , or lean meat that is broiled , roasted , or baked rather than fried ; low-fat milk ; minimal amounts of dairy products containing whole cream ; tub margarine ; olive oil and safflower oil ; whole-grain breads and cereals ; and fruits and vegetables . Consistency is vital . The same healthful foods served at the family dinner table should be available at the school cafeteria and should be on hand at Grandma and Grandpa 's house  --  even if Grandma and Grand  --  pa live at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue . Reducing Fat and Cholesterol First Lady Barbara Bush is among millions of Americans serving " heart smart " foods to their families . Even before moving into the White House early this year , Mrs. Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bran muffins . She was determined to have healthful food available for her children and grand  --  children . The first lady 's recipe calls for skim milk , safflower oil , and miller 's bran . She told the White House chef to " make plenty and freeze them . " Although the muffins were for private consumption , Phyllis C. Richman , a food writer for the Washington Post , published Mrs. Bush 's recipe in her column " Rich-man 's Table , " and these delicious HEAVBEAT eating habits will affect their health as adults . Youngsters aged 6 to 11 should consume no more than 22 grams of saturated fat daily  --  about the amount of fat in two Big Macs with fries . Boys aged 12 to 17 should have no more than 30 grams of saturated fat , and girls 12 to 17 no more than 24 grams of saturated fat daily . No child should eat more than 300 milli  --  grams of cholesterol daily  --  about the amount in one large egg . How to get the fat out ? Begin with breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cholesterol away . For a quick morning meal , Oat-Bran Smoothies , made from nonfat milk and fruit , provide plenty of nutrition to start the day .
