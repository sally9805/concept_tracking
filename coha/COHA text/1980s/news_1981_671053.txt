Eileen Cooney is getting a lot of phone calls these days from iron workers asking about airplane reservations . They are hard hats who worked with her son , Gerry , and now want to see him fight Larry Holmes for the heavyweight championship March 15 in Las Vegas , Nev. // " Oh yes , " Mrs. Cooney said , " Gerry was an iron worker in Manhattan with his father . He even worked on the new Yankee Stadium. " // Besides the hard hats , there will be a lot of her neighbors from the Huntington , L.I. , area , where " Cooney Power " bumper stickers proliferate , on hand for the fight at Caesars Palace . At least 70 have signed up so far for a $389 charter package that will include a $50 ticket to the fight and everything else but meals . It is being put together by one of her neighbors , Frank Eck , a former Associated Press editor. // Being the mother of possibly the next world champion hasn ' t changed her life much , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerry as often because he is so busy . " When you have six children , people in the neighborhood know who you are , anyway , " she said. // The sight of her husband running through the streets followed by the future heavyweight contender , two of his brothers and their German shepherd made the Cooney family a conversation topic even before Gerry got famous . " I only wish his father were alive to see all of this , " said Mrs. Cooney. // " Now I watch Gerry on TV and I can ' t believe that it ' s him , that it ' s all happening . " <> <> Second Thoughts // Almost 10 years after Bernice Gera won a 5-2 decision from New York ' s highest court giving her the right to umpire minor league baseball , she ' s still struggling to get back into the game. // Mrs. Gera , who won her case Jan. 14 , 1972 after a six-year court battle , is working at a retirement complex as an assistant clubhouse director in Pembroke Pines , Fla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wants to be back in baseball , but not behind the plate. // " I have no interst in umpiring , " she said . " I ' d like to be working with a baseball school for kids . As far as umpiring goes , I still think there ' s nothing like a good fight on the field between an umpire and a player , but at 51 , I ' m too old to fight. " // It was on June 24 , 1972 , that Mrs. Gera umpired her first - and last - game in a Class A New York-Pennsylvania State League game at Geneva , N.Y. Everything was going well , she said , until she reversed a call at second base. // " It was a force out , a bang-bang play , " she said . " My call was wrong and I reversed it . I took a beating for that . I walked off after the game and quit . I could win in the courts , but I couldn ' t force the umps to work with me. " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until 1978 , when she quit and joined Radio City Music Hall ' s group-sales department . In 1980 , an investor agreed to help back her pet project : a baseball school for children in Florida . So she moved . Then the plans fell through and she lost some money but decided to retain her condominium anyway. // " I don ' t like being out of baseball , " she said . " Eventually I ' ll get back into it . Maybe as a manager . " <> <> Basketball Comeback // It was only a couple of years ago that professional basketball was taking a hard look at itself because its troubles were of its own making . Attendance was declining ; the schedule worked against intercity rivalries ; many critics believed the game had become stagnant , and some critics even said that the National Basketball Association had hurt itself by cutting down on violence . Cities with the biggest markets , like New York , Chicago and Los Angeles , had unimpressive teams . Other big-market cities had no teams at all . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , changing rules. // Worst of all , the fading popularity was reflected in television broadcasts of N.B.A. games . Ratings dropped , and pro basketball fell behind college basketball and still further behind baseball and football . Even the so-called trashsports shows were drawing bigger television audiences . CBS , which had the television rights to N.B.A. basketball , was having second thoughts about its commitment and was considering cutting back . Like the basketball industry , CBS Sports was doing its own introspection. // In just two years since that 1978-79 recession , professional basketball has bounced back with new vigor , marked by rising attendance and television ratings . The most important indicator is the agreement signed last week between CBS and the N.B.A. That contract , reported to be worth about $88 million for its four-year term , reflected changes the league had wanted in response to fan and news-media criticism of tape-delay and late-night coverage of the league ' s final playoff series . " There will be no tape delays in our championship series , " said Commissioner Larry O ' Brien , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewing. " // At CBS there was a nice , comfortable feeling as Jim Harrington , the executive producer for N.B.A. basketball , reflected on the turnaround , which he said started two years ago . The most rewarding change was the shift from the concept of regional broadcasts to a national one , with the object of getting on the best possible games . Until then CBS was sending three to five games to various regions. // " What we found , " Harrington said , " was that there was so much local basketball on the air that fans could not distinguish between local and regional . Coupled with the shift to a national broadcast , we improved our on-air product . We added cameras and videotape machines . And we hired Bill Russell , who had been so successful as the analyst at ABC. " // A significant aspect of the new broadcast contract is a reduced schedule . CBS has acquired rights to the tournament of the National Collegiate Athletic Association and for 14 college games . That enables the network to begin N.B.A. coverage immediately after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , following on the heels of the exciting N.C.A.A. championship , we go into the most exciting part of the N.B.A. season , which is the closing stretch , the beginning of the playoffs and then into the championship series , " Harrington said . " And because of the attractiveness of the N.B.A. All-Star game , we also have retained the right to broadcast that. " // " In our judgment this gives us the best live TV schedule in the business , " Harrington said . <> <> McGuire Power // It is commonplace for fathers to take sons into the family company or set them up in some other business , but it ' s different with the McGuires . Al McGuire owes what amounts to a second career - films , radio , records and a new television show - to his son Rob , an advertising man turned agent-manager . Al McGuire , once a player for St. John ' s and the Knicks and later the coach who guided Marquette to the national championship of 1976 , is Rob McGuire ' s only client. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was in his fourth year of broadcasting college basketball for NBC , and he served as vice chairman of Medalist Industries , a sports-equipment company based in Milwaukee . His only other outside activity was after-dinner speaking , for which he commanded a $10 , 000 fee . Because only a few corporations or sponsors could afford that kind of money , McGuire had plenty of leisure time to spend at home in Brookfield , Wis. , with his wife , Pat. // That , last June , was where his 26-year-old son Rob came in . For a few years after his graduation from Marquette , Rob McGuire had a few jobs in advertising . He was not enthusiastic about the business and was having difficulty finding work he liked. // " Why not work for me ? " Al McGuire asked his son . No sooner said than done . From his office in Los Angeles , the son is euphorically negotiating as much work as his 53-year-old father can manage. // The first thing Al did was to cut a record of country-Western music with Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of McGuire , Hall and a few other participants is selling beautifully in Kentucky , and now they are starting to market it in California. // Last week Al McGuire completed his role in a motion picture , " Final Cut , " starring Hal Holbrook . It is a murder mystery in which the principal suspect is a member of a college basketball team . The coach in the film is Al McGuire. // McGuire is doing a three-minute sports show five days a week for Mutual Radio . His partner is Billy Packer , who paired with McGuire for three years on the NBC college basketball broadcasts before switching last summer to CBS. // McGuire has also completed a pilot for a television series named after him . The half-hour broadcast will make its debut in April on NBC stations in New York , Chicago , Los Angeles , Washington and Cleveland . The first subject is professional basketball in Boston , with the focus on Larry Bird and Coach Red Auerbach of the Celtics. // When his term as vice chairman of Medalist Industries expired last summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is staying on in a less time-consuming capacity , as a paid consultant. // All this activity has baffled Al ' s wife , who is unable to keep up with his variety of work . " All I know , " she said , " is that he works for NBC . " McGuire says he senses that he is beginning to be overexposed and that he may soon tire the public . " Right now I ' m so bad I ' m good , " he says . " It can ' t last forever . " He has confided to associates that some day not long from now he may escape to New Zealand to spend the rest of his life riding his beloved motorcycle. // John Radosta //
