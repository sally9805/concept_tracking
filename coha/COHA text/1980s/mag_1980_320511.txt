In the West Bank , even advocating peace has its hazards <P> The accumulated violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank has led to a new consensus of smoldering anger among Palestinians that has drastically curtailed the voices of moderation . Last week , after completing a tour of Palestinian communities in three Arab countries and in the occupied territories . TIME Jerusalem Bureau Chief David Aikman filed this report : <P> <P> At an Al-Fatah headquarters near the ruins of the Nabatiya refugee camp in Lebanon , flattened by an Israeli air strike in 1974 , an unsmiling fedayeen officer in camouflage fatigues declares grimly : " In practical terms we are fighting the Americans . We have a slogan : ' The land is for the people who liberate it . ' " <P> The sentiment is one of chilling determination . It is found not just in Palestine Liberation Organization circles but also among large numbers of Arabs living in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip who have hitherto rejected violence as a solution to the Palestinian problem . Part of it is born of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Part is an expression of anger at the bomb attacks last month that maimed the West Bank Arab mayors of Nablus and Ramallah . Argues Hikmat al-Masri , board chairman of Najah University in Nablus : " Under international law we should be protected by the Israelis . But they did not come to Nablus Mayor Bassam Shaka'a and ask him about the incident . " Adds Rashad al-Shawwa , the mayor of Gaza : " We are against terror , but I am afraid that in the state of frustrations of the Palestinians , violence must be used . " <P> Rashad al-Shawwa is no radical : he has been the target of terrorist attacks because of his view that Gaza could not function without some kind of cooperation with the occupying Israelis . But at Bir Zeit University , just north of Ramallah in the West Bank , the students ' anti-Israeli rhetoric would do credit to a warm-up rally for P.L.O . Chairman Yasser Arafat . Says one 23-year-old student : " We believe in the slogan , ' What has been taken by force must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the universal struggle against imperialism all over the world . " <P> Sadly , the growing extremism in the West Bank has isolated or intimidated longtime advocates of communal peace between Jews and Arabs in the Middle East . In his quiet Ramallah apartment , Aziz Shahadeh , a lawyer since 1936 , reflects on recent changes in the two communities . " I always thought that there was a silent majority of moderates among us , as there was among the Jews , " he says . " Now the extremists are so powerful on both sides that the moderates have hushed their voices . Some day , there will be a catastrophe here , a real massacre . " <P> Other Palestinians , who by no standard could be considered terrorists , worry about some terrible final conflagration . Says U.S. &shy; educated Sari Nasir , who teaches at the University of Jordan in Amman : " People are saying now that it 's not a question of Israel 's borders , it 's a question of its existence . It 's either them or us. "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
