" I have made promises to promoters that have not been fulfilled , " he explained the other day in the spacious apartment on West End Avenue where he has lived for many years , " and I felt I should get rid of them once and for all . By the end of this tour , I ' ll have only one promise still outstanding . That ' s to Max Gordon of the Village Vanguard , where my career as a folk singer began . Whenever he feels that he is at his desperate moment , I ' ll come into the Vanguard for two weeks. " // At 54 , Mr. Belafonte is lean , lithe and as strikingly handsome as he was when he first appeared in the 1950 ' s and helped give folk music a period of mass appeal . His husky voice is , if anything , even huskier than it was then , a huskiness that is emphasized by the intensity with which he expresses himself. // One of his reasons for wiping the slate clean of performing commitments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily to developing outlets in the third world for black and minority-group artists who , after finding acceptance in this country in the 1970 ' s in the wake of the civil-rights movement , are now being bypassed by motion pictures , the recording industry and the theater . <> <> A Time of Breakthroughs // " Back in 1959 , " Mr. Belafonte said , " I fully believed in the civil-rights movement . I had a personal commitment to it , and I had my personal breakthroughs - I produced the first black TV special ; I was the first black to perform at the Waldorf-Astoria . I felt if we could just turn the nation around , things would fall into place. // " And it actually happened , " he went on . " Because of the civilrights movement , there were black reporters , black advertising on TV , black ballplayers . The country was in a renaissance. " // That mood , Mr. Belafonte says , lasted from the late 50 ' s to the mid-70 ' s . " The civil-rights movement ended then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had moved into the institutions of power were acting like their white predecessors . When I talked to members of the Black Caucus in Congress , I don ' t find much energy . It ' s business as usual , making deals with other members of Congress . They ' ve had a taste of power , and they want to be re-elected. // " When the doors of Hollywood shut on minorities and blacks at the end of the 70 ' s , " he continued , " a lot of black artists had been enjoying the exploitation for 10 years . But one day they found the shop had closed down . Now I find some of them working in department stores , in restaurants , in little offices where you might expect them to be selling music services , but instead they ' re selling fertilizer. ' // Mr. Belafonte , who is building a house on the island of St. Martin in the Caribbean , had been thinking of retiring there . But he has changed his mind. // " I feel I still have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ears of a lot of decent people . " <> <> Third World Opportunities // He sees , in third world countries , opportunities for minority artists to do things that will not be controlled by major film companies , major record companies or television networks . At the same time , they are projects that will satisfy what he sees as a desperate desire in those countries to " develop their own media , their own culture , their own view of self. " // " Can we make an overture to Nigeria ? " he asks . " It ' s an OPEC country , and we need oil . There ' s a common language , English . Can we get them to set up record-pressing plants , workshops , festivals , open to artists all over the world ? I think their national integrity would lead them to be more interested in things that I ' m interested in than Hollywood is . Hollywood is not interested in a definitive motion picture about Harriet Tubman or Toussaint L ' Ouverture or Bessie Smith or Duke Ellington. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belafonte will turn his full attention to this and other projects , such as getting black plays and black actors into American regional theaters , which , he says , " can ' t wait to have us . " Meanwhile , his current tour raises other questions . When he and other folk singers such as Pete Seeger were starting in the 1950 ' s , their sources were as Mr. Belafonte says , " really traditional . " <> <> Updating 30 ' s Protest Songs // " We gave birth to Joan Baez and Bob Dylan and James Taylor and all those other great people , " he pointed out . " And they began to write in the folk tradition about things of the day . This created a personal problem for me : why sing protest songs of the 30 ' s in the 60 ' s ? To sing about the chain gang seemed antiquated unless you see it in a current context. " // He has solved this problem to some extent in his program at the Garden State Arts Center , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // " It ' s as relevant to the migrant workers of today as it was in the 1930 ' s , " he stressed . Mr. Belafonte is making this tour with virtually none of the traditional commercial support for a touring star . It has been years since he had a hit record , made a film or appeared on television . His first record album in seven years has just been released by Columbia , " Loving You Is Where I Belong . " In an attempt to get radio exposure , he has made it an album primarily of ballads . <> <> ' Got to Get Out of the Parade ' // " It ' s my way of coming in , " he explained . " I noticed that Kenny Rogers and Don McLean and Barbra Streisand were doing beautiful ballads and getting a big response . I found that I ' ve got to get out of the parade and find out whose marching in it . I forgot what the parade was about . I have to re-evaluate my place in it. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t fill Madison Square Garden or a baseball park , " he said . " I ' d be lost in those places . My constituency wouldn ' t go there , anyhow. " // " Maybe , " he continued , his eyes lighting up as an idea struck him , " maybe for me the Village Vanguard is the place . " Mr. Belafonte sings at the Garden State Arts Center , Exit 114 on the Garden State Parkway , at 8 : 30 P.M. tonight and tomorrow . Tickets are $7 to $13 , with lawn seating $6. 50 .
