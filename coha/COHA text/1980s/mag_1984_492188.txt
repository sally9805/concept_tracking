ning with the President and Mrs. Reagan . We proceeded to the dining room , where husbands and wives were assigned to separate tables . Nancy was seated with the sultan . I was assigned to table No. 10 , which I was told was under the portrait of Abraham Lincoln and in front of the fireplace . Upon arriving at my seat , I found that the place card next to mine said simply , " Mr. President . " So I had dinner with Nancy 's husband . As we ate and talked , I learned that the President in private is as humorous , as optimistic , as generous in his view of America as ever he seemed in public . The " President " you see in the media is not the creation of ghost writers , make-up artists and lighting technicians in the White House studio . He is a vigorous man who works out daily in his White House gym as often as the affairs of the world permit . And he looks forward to his vacations at the ranch in Californiawhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that horseback riding is marvelous exercise for body and soul . You move every muscle in your body when you get on a horse , he said . " When a man sits on the outside of a horse , it does good things for the insides of the man , " he said with a laugh . The President gives close attention to his diet , he told me . The famous jellybeans , for example , are not often eaten . It all began , he said , when he was giving up pipe smoking . For a time , the jellybeans helped . But now he rarely eats them . The demands of his office for ceremonial lunches and dinners would seem to make it impossible for the President to keep a sensible diet . But there was good dietary sense beneath the elegance of this night 's state dinner  --  Columbia River salmon with a light sauce verte , a supreme of chicken with mushrooms and an herbed I thought that the small talk Beurt and I had with him before dinner would be our only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place card to my right said simply , " Mr. President . " sauce were the main dishes served on Nancy Reagan 's famous White House china . The President 's vigorous fitness served him and the nation well when John Hinckley , Jr. , shot him outside the Washington Hilton . The President told me that at first he did not know he had been shot , that he thought the pain he felt was from a rib that cracked when the Secret Service agents first threw themselves on the President to protect him from the shots and then threw him in the White House limousine , literally , for the fast trip to George Washington University Hospital . He felt God was with him when he arrived at the hospital , he told me , because the physicians should have been gone by that hour and the oper- Christian faith began with his mother 's teaching  --  and that he could not serve his office without that faith today . Our seats at this dinner were almost directly beneath the C.P.A. Healy portrait of Lincoln done in 1869 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who also knew that sometimes the President of the United States stands wholly alone with the responsibilities of the nation and that only prayer and an unbending faith in God can give the President the strength and courage to stand so alone . He ca n't imagine anyone running the country without God 's help , he told me . The need for guidance is enough to bring a man to his knees every day , he added . The Moslems still observe the Koran 's prohibition on alcohol , and because the Omanis are Moslems , there were no champagne toasts at this White House dinner . Instead , the representatives of the two cultures traded formal compliments about each other 's leadership qualities . In the Arab manner , they pledged mutual support . A relaxed , happy feeling prevailed . Does the President take vitamins ? Yes . He explained that when he and Nancy were first married , Nancy 's father , the late Dr. Loyal Davis , a prominent Chicago neurosurgeon , had told them they should take a multivitamin every day just in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every morning they each take a Multicebrin ? . We talked about drugs and marijuana . He is obviously proud of the work Nancy does in fighting drug abuse . He spoke about the harm of marijuana and pointed out that we are now finding emphysema in young marijuana smokers . He said that the Russians could wipe out our country if they could get a single generation of young people addicted to drugs and marijuana . The President spoke for a time about the success of the efforts to eliminate marijuana use in the military services . Peer pressure is at work , he said , and our service men and women no longer want to entrust their own safety and their own lives to someone who might be stoned . So drug use is becoming unpopular for the young men and women in ourarmed forces  --  and , we hope , to their contemporaries in the civilian world . It was apparent that the President hates smoking of all kinds . He told about his brother , who had been a two- or a three-pack-a-day smoker . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has also had triple-bypass heart surgery . The President feels this was a case where lifestyle made the difference between health and illness . Their genes were similar , but their lifestyles were quite different . The President himself never smoked anything but a pipe and he gave that up . The President assured me that he does eat fiber and gains all the benefits therefrom promptly . I told him about potatoes and my theory that more upper-respiratory illnesses occur in the spring when people are eating potatoes that have only one-fourth of their original vitamin C content left in them . Potatoes are such an important source of vitamin C in the diet that vitamin-deficient spring potatoes could cause susceptibility to respiratory viruses . I was amazed by the President 's knowledge of nutrition and health . While we are on the subject of potatoes , the President told a story of a famous medical study of 550 pairs of Irish brothers . The brothers who came to America tended to develop cardiovascular disease , but the brothers who stayed in Ireland kept their health  --  probably because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing them . The President told this story with great wit and with a better memory for the facts than most physicians would display . A full account of the study appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine . I asked the President why he thought Jane Fonda did the things she did in Vietnam . When he was governor of California , the President said , he was visited in his home by a veteran who had been a prisoner of war in one of the North Vietnamese prison camps that Jane Fonda visited . She took her fellow American before the international press that accompanied her on the North Vietnamese tour and used him as an example of the " humane treatment " that she said the Communists were giving their American prisoners . But the truth of the treatment was that the prison guards had hanged this young man by his injured arm and had beaten him four or five times . He had been forced by his captors to cooperate with Jane Fonda and stand before the press with her . But the President said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so easily duped by the Communists . Their propagandists are masters at generating publicity and the adulation of the press for articulate but naive public figures who are willing to stand as critics of America and as friends of our enemies . They give our critics starring roles in the theater of the press . The tables around us were filled with well-known people . We saw the heart specialist Michael DeBakey and the fashion designer Calvin Klein , who exchanged kisses with Nancy Reagan . Maria Janis , Gary Cooper 's daughter , was there and so was Fred Astaire 's daughter , Ava . Leonard Silverstein , president of the National Symphony Orchestra , the artist Andrew Wyeth and the philanthropist Richard Mellon Scaife were all enjoying the delightful food and company . The splendid violinists played romantic dinner music without stopping . The President had great fun telling us a story about his visit with Queen Elizabeth of England . They were sitting on the podium , and her aide , who could never turn his back on the queen , was required to walk backward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or left to keep him in a straight line . Noticing that the President had caught her guiding him , she laughed and said , " A man could get killed falling off this thing . " After dinner we walked into the drawing room , where coffee was being served . The President said , " Sanka , please . " " That 's our President ! " I exclaimed . He gets an A + on matters of health maintenance . If he does as well managing the country as he does managing his own health program , we will have a healthy country and a vigorous society . Nancy could n't wait to join the President to share her good news . " The sultan has just given us a $300,000 check for the National Symphony Orchestra , " she exclaimed . She was elated . Modestly , she did n't mention to the President that it was to be used for the Nancy Reagan continued on page III // ho have had a Caesarean section hould only be done when facilities nd personnel are at hand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ontinued from page 65 hair for narrative music in the Naional Symphony under the baton of stislav Rostropovich , who has beome one of the world 's finest conuctors . Nancy 's joy knew no ounds . Since often the President is onoring a country without resoures , one that has sent its represenatives to the White House in an efort to receive dollars , a gift of this agnitude was understandably a hap-y surprise . It was a most appropriate esture and thanks were given in the est of taste . That was the end of my " interiew " because it was apparent that ancy was eager to reclaim her an and Beurt could n't wait to tell e about the great exchange of ideas e 'd had with Ed Meese . After-dinner music in the East oom was gay and light . Later , in the over , the band struck up " Shall We ance .

' m an optimist and Garfield is a pesmist . I look on the bright side and e looks on the dark side . I have a eling that Garfield can say and do a it of things I ca n't , and I might be ble to express myself in some ways rough him that I do n't admit to .

Another book is in the planning stage ( Garfield : His Nine Lives ) and a third prime-time TV special ( " Garfield In The Rough " ) will be aired this fall . For fans who like to decorate their world in Garfield , the great one 's image is available on more than 4,500 licensed products  --  everything from underwear to the cat 's pajamas  --  all approved by Davis . When he gets away from it all , he has little trouble shedding Garfield . The cat dutifully stays back on the drawing board at the end of the day and is n't prodded to life until Davis jars his own imagination the next morning . With that kind of discipline the artist hopes to keep Garfield fresh and funny for another 25 years . That 's their goal . His and Garfield 's . " I 'm happy , " he says simply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as far as my writing ability and my art ability go , I 'm far from satisfied with them ; and we always hope to come out with a funnier strip , a better TV show , a higher quality product . But those are connected with the day-to-day discipline I push myself toward . They 're certainly not long-term life goals , because I 've reached those . " He trades philosophy for humor and seriousness for a grin when a punch line comes to mind : " When you think about it , I could n't be happier for me. "
