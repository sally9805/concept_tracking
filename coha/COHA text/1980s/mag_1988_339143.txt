A huge white ghost cut swiftly through the gentle seas off San Diego . It was the 132-ft. - long America 's Cup challenger New Zealand , the largest boat to vie for the Auld Mug in five decades . A mile away , the smoke-blue catamaran Stars &; Stripes , the first twin-hulled vessel to sail for the Cup , hauled closer to the wind and suddenly accelerated like an Indy speedster . The two craft  --  as different , in the words of New Zealand 's skipper , David Barnes , as " chalk and cheese "  --  were practicing for this week 's best-of-three-races face-off . And for a change , they were practicing on the water instead of in the headlines or the courts . <P> Indeed , this 27th contest for the 8.4-lb. bottomless silver jug culminates a 14-month war of words , wits and writs . Both on and off the water , the meeting is sure to go down as one of the oddest and most acrimonious in the Cup 's 137- year history , one that may drastically alter the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts view the contest as a glaring mismatch . Yachting wisdom holds that catamarans are faster than monohulls under most conditions . No wonder both competitors , for very different reasons , appeared to agree on which was the likely winner . " Our chances are better than one in a hundred , " said Auckland Banker Michael Fay , 39 , who built and campaigns New Zealand , " but not much . " <P> Strangely , too , both sides seemed to be looking ahead not so much to the contest as beyond it . The American defenders  --  Skipper Dennis Conner ; the San Diego Yacht Club , which holds the Cup ; and Sail America , a private corporation that manages the event for the club  --  were intent on eliminating what they saw as an irritating upstart challenge so that they could get back to planning a traditional Cup defense for 1991 , a several-month-long multinational regatta that may be worth more than $1 billion to San Diego in tourist revenues . Fay , on the other hand , appeared to view this week 's race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will mount if he loses . <P> This state of affairs is the result of some gale-force legal tacking . After Conner won the Cup from Australia in Fremantle in February 1987 , S.D.Y.C. did not make the customary announcement of a future regatta . Normally , such events are held at approximately four-year intervals . They are open to multiple challengers  --  there were 13 in Fremantle  --  who race for the right to face the defender . Through the years , the design has been limited by gentlemen 's agreement to so-called 12-meter sloops  --  a complicated equation involving length , girth and sail area that works out to boats measuring about 45 ft. at the waterline . As S.D.Y.C. and Sail America bickered over details , Fay , whose Cup entry narrowly lost to Conner at Fremantle , seized the initiative . He interpreted the simple , two-page 1857 Cup rules , known as the deed of gift , to say that he could challenge S.D.Y.C. to a one-on-one contest to be held within ten months , and he maintained that he was entitled to name his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zealand is the largest vessel allowed , 90 ft. at the waterline.
