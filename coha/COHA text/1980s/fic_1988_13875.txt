Big Mama raised me in the company of wise old black women like herself who managed to survive some dangerous and terrible times and live to tell about them . Their only admitted vice , aside from exchanging a little bit of no-harm-done gossip now and then , was dipping snuff . They were always sending me to Mr. Joe 's grocery store to buy silver tins of the fine brown powder wrapped in bright colored labels with names like Bruton 's Sweet Snuff , Georgia Peach and Three Brown Monkies . One time , my mean old cousin Dee Dee told me that snuff was really ground up monkey dust , a delicacy in the royal palaces of Africa . ( DEE DEE enters with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , curious .

What you do is mix three big spoons of monkey dust in a glass of milk and drink it through a straw , fast . If you drink it all you 'll wake up and be real pretty .

DAUGHTER I 'm sorry . I 'm listening , Big Mama . BIG MAMA Now , getting back to the story . It was a time when the only place colored folks could sit on a bus was in the back . But the number 99 was known as the Maid 's Bus . It arrived downtown every weekday morning at 6 a.m. to pick up the colored domestic workers bound for the rich , white suburbs ninety minutes away . Now on this day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks was stirred up over the lynching and the killings of colored peoples all over the south . A colored woman had just been found dead . She was raped and sawed open by six white men who made her brother watch ' em ravish her . The whites were getting meaner as the summer got hotter . ( YOUNG WOMAN , MISS MARY , and MISS CORINE march in singing a spirited gospel tune  --  they stand to wait for bus , fanning in the heat. ) p. 11 MISS MARY Ai n't it hot .

BIG MAMA Yes ma'am , even if they was rioting downtown , white ladies in Northend were gon na have they meals cooked , babies looked after and laundry done . That 's why they bought the bus . That morning I made the mistake of sittin ' in Corine 's seat . Now , conversations on the number 99 went something like this p. 12 MISS CORINE Now , shug , you gon na have to move . I been riding this bus for thirteen years and I ai n't never sit nowhere else , but right here . It 's plenty room in the back . This my seat and you just gon na have to move .

Oh Lord , my white lady asked me to come in on Sunday afternoon , would you believe , to pour tea for some English foreigners visiting her mama . I told her that her mama was gon na have to pour that tea herself , ' cause I had to go to church on Sunday . The Lord would n't appreciate my missing a prayer service to pour tea for the Queen of England . MISS MARY My white lady , bless her heart , is as simple as a chile . When the boss man was near ' bout fifty years old , he turn around and left the missus and two grown children to marry this girl right out of college .

But now can you tell me where my spit cup is right now ? MISS MARY Corine , I been telling you this as long as I knowed you and I done knowed you a mighty long time , it 'd be highway robbery for me to charge money for a gift give to me by God .

All right , I want all you niggers off the bus . That mean everybody . Line up over there . " Cars was passing ' long the highway , with folks looking at us like we was from the moon . The white woman was leaning on the Cadillac looking mean and evil as a snake . I thought for sure we was gon na be killed .

I had to admit I looked good  --  sharp as a tack . I even bought a little see-through nightgown for the wedding night and got some love oil from the hoodoo woman to keep his nature up all night . I was ready . Then , the day of my wedding Johnny Earl Davis call my mama 's house and said he had another woman .

DAUGHTER As time got closer for me to go the the river , I started spending more time alone with my Big Mamas , women who gave stories as gifts . Miss Lamama was special in that . Being married to an African , Miss Lamama learned their tradition of storytelling . She wore pink slippers everyday but Sunday when she sang in the choir . I loved hearing her catch notes with her voice and then letting them fly over our heads into the congregation like birds . When Miss Lamama was telling a story her voice was like that too . MISS LAMAMA Now , Daughter , I 'm gon na tell you about the time Miss Shine got even for a four hundred-year-old wrong , as it was told to me . And ' long as I 'm black I 'll never forget it . ( MISS SHINE enters and mimes rolling in tea cart . ) MISS LAMAMA Miss Shine lived down the street from us . She had worked in the governor 's mansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no insurance and a lot of bills to pay . But Miss Shine caught on quick that the governor and his wife was just simple country crackers . The funniest thing she had to do was pour tea everyday at four o'clock for the governor and his wife . They would sit there in the living room , quiet as two rocks in a river , slurping that sweet tea till suppertime . This particular December , our colored high school chorus was selected to sing at the governor 's mansion on Christmas Eve . For weeks that 's all folk talked about . p. 28 MISS SHINE You know I 'm gon na be there to see our children show out . The governor done asked me already to stay past sundown on Christmas Eve . MISS LAMAMA Weeks before the first Christmas pine was chopped , Miss Shine was busy polishing cabinets full of silver and starching closets full of linen . Her biggest job , and one she loved best and saved for last , was cleaning the grand French crystal chandelier that hung in the entry hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think . MISS LAMAMA Two days before the singing a strong feeling came over Miss Shine like something bad was about to happen . But , Christmas Eve when she seen them three yellow school buses roll around the circle driveway , Miss Shine 's heart was near ' bout busting with joy . She knowed we were gon na do her proud that night . Them little white children was dressed up in blue jackets for the boys and blue skirts for the girls . But we had on long white robes with gold sashes over our shoulders looking just like black angels . The first group of them little white children sang they Christmas carols in high pitched cut-off notes that did n't sound right to Miss Shine , but she clapped when they was done . The second group was n't much better , but , Lord , then them colored children broke loose . I led the choir . When we was done there was a deep hush , quiet like even God had stopped what she was doing to listen . Then they sent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that governor only invited them white children inside for hot chocolate . Our faces went soft and sad like they was gon na cry . Except for Corine . Her face was hard like she wanted to throw a brick through that mansion window . Your Big Mama looked like she did n't ' spect no less . Shine looked at us , something inside of her broke in two . p. 29 MISS SHINE She was madder than a foam-mouth dog . But what could she do ? She left it in the Lord 's hands , and he came through . With no warning , the big , round crystal that hung from the middle of the chandelier fell with a loud crash on the marble floor , breaking into a million pieces . It did n't hurt nobody , but Shine took it to be a sign . MISS LAMAMA Miss Emmie seen Shine staring and snapped up " Shine , get a broom and sweep up this mess before one of the children gets hurt . " MISS SHINE She swept up every piece of crystal she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jagged edge was a dagger in her heart . Folks say things changed , but it 's still like slavery times , Miss Shine 's mind eased back , way , way back . She heard a chant far off and deep as slave graves and old Africa . MISS LAMAMA ( beats her calabash in time . ) Blood , boil thick , run red like a river , slave scream , wail , moan after they dead . Daddy lynched , Mama raped , baby sister sold down river . Slaves scream , wail , moan after they dead . The cook knew what to do to save the race , stop the screams . MISS SHINE Miss Shine all of a sudden knowed what she had to do to save the race . She was possessed by her power . When she got home she went into her bedroom and she got the wood bowl her mama give her and the iron head of her husband 's hammer . She come back to the table spread with all the broke crystal and ground it till sweat dripped off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she ground it and she ground it till it was fine as dust . Then she tied it in a corner of her slip . When Miss Shine has to go back to work after New Year 's she was ready , almost happy to go . p. 30 MISS LAMAMA Miss Emmie stopped her from washing the lunch dishes to tell her , " Shine , we ready for tea . " Miss Shine yes ma'amed her , looking direct in her eyes . Miss Emmie was n't used to colored making eye contact and she near ' bout run out the kitchen . Miss Shine went on as usual fixing tea . She put the kettle on to boil . DAUGHTER AND MISS LAMAMA Blood boil thick . MISS LAMAMA She kept hearing whispers . She poured the boiling water over the tea leaves and strained it into the big silver teapot . DAUGHTER AND MISS LAMAMA Run red like a raging river . MISS LAMAMA She took down two china cups with a flower pattern and set ' em straight on matching saucers . DAUGHTER AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MISS LAMAMA Miss Shine put everything on the big tea cart . DAUGHTER AND MISS LAMAMA Nobody know how he die . MISS LAMAMA She untied the knot in the corner of her slip and emptied the fine crystals into the sugar bowl and DAUGHTER AND MISS LAMAMA Stirred it up , stirred it up , stirred it up goooood . ( Sighs of relief . ) MISS LAMAMA Miss Shine kept pouring tea for the governor and Miss Emmie for more than two weeks before she disappeared . Some folks say she moved to an entirely colored town in Texas , other folks say she was n't really of this world in the first place . Nobody ever see Miss Shine again . From then on , the colored high school chorus started singing Christmas carols at the colored nursing home every year to honor our own folks . Nobody ever talk about wanting to sing for the governor no more . Every time I sing " Spirit of the Living God " solo , I dedicate it to Miss Shine , wherever she is . Daughter , remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ma'am . There are all kinds of gifts you can give and receive , Miss Lamama 's was pride . ( MISS LAMAMA exits singing line from mournful gospel. ) p. 32 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO SCENE : AUNT MAE enters straightening up room . DAUGHTER Miss Lamama 's second husband , Mr. Otis , kept Aunt Mae company on Sunday afternoons in her upstairs bedroom . He drove a taxi cab everyday ' cept Sunday , when he would show up at Aunt Mae 's and give me a dime to go catch the ice cream truck , making me promise to play on the porch till the street lights came on . That 's when he would go home to Miss Lamama . Every Sunday Aunt Mae and Mr. Otis kept the door closed and the gospel singing on the radio turned up loud . Once I asked her , " What ya 'll be doing in the room with the door closed ? ' AUNT MAE We be taking care of grown folks business . DAUGHTER One Sunday , Miss Lamama come knocking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Lamama wan na talk to her . DAUGHTER Yes ma'am . Aunt Mae ! ( DAUGHTER runs to the bedroom door , scared , and whispers . ) Aunt Mae ! Miss Lamama at the door . She wan na talk to you . AUNT MAE Tell her I be right there . DAUGHTER She coming , Miss Lamama . ( DAUGHTER goes to hide behind furniture . AUNT MAE strolls out of the bedroom slowly. ) p. 33 AUNT MAE What you want , Jessie Pearl ? MISS LAMAMA Want you to know you can have him . AUNT MAE ( looks at MISS LAMAMA stunned , then laughs her rowdy laugh ) . Have him ? MISS LAMAMA I mean it , Mae Francis . Since Otis took up with you , all I had is trouble . Folks talk . Even the pastor know where Otis be on Sunday after church . I 'm through . ( She slaps her hands together and turns away . ) AUNT MAE You got the wrong idea , Jessie Pearl . I do n't need a husband . I ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have is a liquor business . MISS LAMAMA Otis ai n't bought groceries for over two years . Told me his mama in Ohio needed some operations . I found out she been dead ten years . Tell him his clothes be on the front porch this evening . G'night , Mae Francis , see you in choir rehearsal . ( MISS LAMAMA exits slowly , proudly . AUNT MAE is angry . ) AUNT MAE Men like that give me a bad name . I try to give married women a break . I do n't want to be cause of no major interference like that . DAUGHTER Aunt Mae went back upstairs and a few seconds later , Mr. Otis come running out the front door tryin ' to catch up with Miss Lamama. p. 34 AUNT MAE ( re-enters bedroom and speaks to Otis ) . Get out of my house now , you no good lyin ' skunk butt and do n't come round here no more . That means till hell freeze over . DAUGHTER Me and Aunt Mae ran to the living room window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Otis running on drunk legs behind Miss Lamama with his shirttails flying in the wind . AUNT MAE Women got to stick together . Now , Daughter , get your cup . ( AUNT MAE pours them both a drink . ) Daughter , please promise me something . DAUGHTER What , Aunt Mae ? AUNT MAE Do n't you ever , long as grass is green , go nowhere with a man unless you got some money in your pocket . If you with a man that do n't mean you no good , you can always tell him to go to the devil and catch you a taxi cab or a Greyhound bus home . Promise me , baby , will you ? DAUGHTER Yes ma'am . I promise . Aunt Mae and Miss Lamama were almost friends after that . Aunt Mae did n't seem to miss Mr. Otis none . The things I learned about love . All kinds of possibilities . ( Upbeat blues intro for next scene. ) p. 35 Act 2 , Scene 3 SCENE THREE DAUGHTER When the Sunday-after-dark crowed came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cussing like it was any other Sunday . Most Sunday evenings after the sun settled down and darkness fell round Aunt Mae 's house , she could be found sitting like a queen at the head of her kitchen table pouring short glasses of whiskey for women Big Mama said was loose and men she said was loud . I usually sat on a stool by the refrigerator drinking ginger ale and two splashes in a Dixie cup pretending to be just one of the crowd . ( MISS TOM and MISS CORINE enter . ) DAUGHTER Hey , Miss Tom . Hey , Miss Corine . ( WOMEN greet DAUGHTER and AUNT MAE . Each woman throws a coin into a glass bowl and picks up the drink AUNT MAE pours for her . ) Oh , Miss Tom , Billy and Ray Lee got in a fight . I saw ' em out my window last night . MISS TOM What you doing up that late ? AUNT MAE Hey , Tom , where your sister at tonight ? MISS TOM Lily at the clinic patching up some more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CORINE ( playfully ) . Mae Francis , you know Lily and Tom ai n't no sisters . More like man and wife , ai n't it , Tom ? p. 36 MISS TOM You keep talking and you gon na need patching up . Now get out of my business and take care of your own . If I say she my sister , she my sister . Ai n't got to be by blood . AUNT MAE Amen . Awoman . Hey , Corine , what you be doing round Kin Folks Corner late at night ? MISS CORINE Who told you that ? I 've been working with Doctor Willie as an apprentice . MISS TOM You call picking roots and berries , quacking and running numbers work ? MISS CORINE Doctor Willie did n't pick up root work off the corner , it 's a science . Doctor Willie apprenticed with a one hundred percent pure Cherokee Injun medicine man . AUNT MAE I got Injun blood in me too . MISS TOM What Negro do n't ? MISS CORINE My great-grandma was pure dee Injun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one took me back to the reservation to meet the medicine man . He taught me some things that ca n't be found in the history books . The Injuns was doing just fine before the white man come here , living on land that did n't belong to nobody , taking care of business . DAUGHTER ( trying to get her attention ) . Aunt Mae . Aunt Mae . Tell me about the time you was a dance hall girl . p. 37 MISS TOM Lord , Jesus , I do n't want to hear that one ! AUNT MAE ( laughs wickedly ) . Ai n't you heard them old tales enough to tell ' em to me ? DAUGHTER I wan na hear . You tell ' em better . Tell me ' bout the fat men . Please , Aunt Mae , please . ( MISS TOM dances with AUNT MAE , mimes fat man , encourages AUNT MAE . Upbeat blues from opening . ) AUNT MAE I used to waltz , jitterbug or whatever was called for around the dance floor with customers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes ma'am , they was a curse to us working girls . All they ever wan na do is hug up and grind . So I used to plump myself up with a pillow to keep ' em from getting too close to my privates . Now some of them mens said they wanted to take care of me . They was expecting a compromise on my part that I could not make . I was too independent to take like that without giving . I always have been my own woman . Take marriage , for instance . Now that 's a job , darling , and I earned my way dollar for dollar . I put up with other women , drinking and gambling but the one thing I would not tolerate was a liar . I throwed Mason Pew out of his own house two days after I married him for lying to me . DAUGHTER Did you let him come back , Aunt Mae ? AUNT MAE No ma'am . p. 38 MISS CORINE Tell the truth now . AUNT MAE I 'm telling the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him to get up off his rusty knees and out of my face . I did n't want to hear that mess . Was n't no room in my life for liars , that 's all there was to it . DAUGHTER What you do when he left ? AUNT MAE You mean when I put him out . Honey , it was like the Fourth of July , when the smoke cleared I felt free . DAUGHTER So why you get married in the first place ? AUNT MAE Why anybody would , for security . And on top of that , Mason Pew was good looking . MISS CORINE He was good looking . AUNT MAE Lord knows that was a good looking man . But his lying took something out of me . I took him back in my house , but I never took him back in my heart . Do n't let nobody fool you , sex is something you can live without for a long time . Like my mama told me , if it gets hot , fan it . Love only last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that last line . ) DAUGHTER When people used to ask me what I wanted to be when I grew up , I 'd say , " I wan na be like Aunt Mae . I wan na be independent so every day be like the Fourth of July . " ALL WOMEN Amen , chile . ( WOMEN exit . DAUGHTER and MISS TOM walk off to fishing area. ) p. 39 Act 2 , Scene 4 SCENE FOUR SCENE : DAUGHTER and MISS TOM sit on stage , apparently fishing . DAUGHTER Me and Miss Tom were friends , good friends . She taught me how to fish , throw a knife , carve a piece of wood , tame birds and believe in a world of impossibilities . Miss Tom was not a pretty woman , she was handsome like a man . Her hands were big , thick and callused . But she had a woman 's eyes , dark and mysterious eyes , that held woman secrets , eyes that had seen miracles and reflected love like only a woman can . MISS TOM Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that keep bad luck in your house . That 's why I try to keep ' em out of my house and out of my business . DAUGHTER What we got to catch with today ? MISS TOM We got a sardine , some Vienna sausages and canned corn . These old crafty swimmers do like that canned corn . But the fish kinda slow this morning . DAUGHTER They slow every time we come here . I do n't know why we ca n't go to the lake ? It 's a lot of people over there . MISS TOM You seen any colored people over there ? DAUGHTER No ma'am . MISS TOM Enough said . p. 40 DAUGHTER Why people different ? How come we ai n't all the same ? MISS TOM Would n't be as interesting everybody be the same . Be like eating peas and potatoes everyday of your life . DAUGHTER I eat grits every day . MISS TOM Ai n't very interesting , is it ? DAUGHTER No ma'am . ( Silence . ) Miss Tom , you the only lady carpenter I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I grow up ? MISS TOM Peaches , you can be anything you want . DAUGHTER Could I marry a woman and live with her like you do with Miss Lily ? MISS TOM Let me put it to you like this , there 's all kind of possibilities for love . I did n't have no choice ' bout who to love , my heart just reached out and grabbed ahold of Miss Lily . She felt the same way I felt , so we lived together . Been together twenty-two years this May . You still got a lot of time to figure out that part of living . DAUGHTER How will I know if I 'm in love ? MISS TOM You wo n't have to ask nobody , you 'll know . DAUGHTER Was my mama in love ? MISS TOM I ' spect she must 've been . You figure . This slick-talking beauty supply salesman driving a yellow convertible come to call on Corine 's shop where Fannie Mae was fixing hair . He offered her a piece of the road , she dropped that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of town in a cloud of fine red dust . You could say she had some kind of feeling . p. 41 DAUGHTER Why could n't I go with her ? MISS TOM Your mama did n't just up and leave you out of spite for wanting the high life . She left here intending to make a better life for you and her . Your mama had the courage to reach . Colored folks , as you know , are the most amazing people on this earth . Anything we put our minds to and our hearts into we can get done good , and most times better than that . You 'll never know if you can do a thing till you try . And a try has never failed . DAUGHTER Yes ma'am . ( Mimes catching fish . ) Oh ! MISS TOM Hey , look like we gon na have fish for dinner after all . DAUGHTER That morning clicked the lock in our friendship , but that was the last time Miss Tom took me fishing . Like she predicted to Big Mama , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll never forget Miss Tom . She and Miss Lily 's spirits probably still live in that big , old , white house , loving each other with their eyes wide open . p. 42 Act 2 , Scene 5 SCENE FIVE DAUGHTER I remember the day that Dee Dee came running into my room all out of breath . " Fannie Mae 's dead , " she said . I almost asked her who she was talking about . All I could think of to say was : " I guess I do n't get to go up north now . " I used to hate Fannie Mae for being dead . Big Mama ? What cause my mama to die ? ( WOMEN enter in funeral clothes/hats softly singing African ritual song from opening . " Yemenjah ah say sool , ah say sool Yemenjah . " ) BIG MAMA Hard headed just like you . DAUGHTER Miss Mary , was my mother stubborn ? MISS MARY Fannie Mae knew her mind and spoke it . DAUGHTER Why my mama have to be the one to die ? AUNT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love ai n't never saved nobody from dying . ( WOMEN begin to march into scene . Solemn gospel music . ) DAUGHTER The only way I can picture her now is asleep at her funeral . I remember sitting on the last pew in the church , all dressed up , with Aunt Mae on one side of me and Miss Corine on the other . The singing that day was sad and I could hear people up in the front hollering and crying . Then they led me up to the front of the church and held me up over the long , white casket surrounded by flowers . Fannie Mae was laying inside looking like she had fallen asleep . She was so beautiful it made my throat hurt to look at her . p. 43 AUNT MAE Do you know who that is ? DAUGHTER It 's Fannie Mae , ai n't it ? AUNT MAE She 's in the Lord 's hands now . We do n't have to worry about her being too pretty no more . She through dancing now . DAUGHTER Big Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right on the lips . Miss Rosa prepared her for burial . She sure did make her look pretty . ( ALL WOMEN except MISS ROSA exit . ) Big Mama said Miss Rosa had habits that would drive Jesus to take a drink of whiskey . One Sunday I met up with Miss Rosa on my way to church . MISS ROSA Morning , Daughter . DAUGHTER Morning . MISS ROSA Pretty flowers you have on . DAUGHTER Thank you . Big Mama made me wear ' em . MISS ROSA Well now , what in the world is wrong with that ? It 's Mother 's Day , is n't it ? The red flower is for your living Big Mamas . And that there white flower 's so your blood mama know you have n't forgotten her . You know you got to respect the dead as well as the living . DAUGHTER Miss Rosa , I do want to thank you for making my mama look so pretty at her funeral . p. 44 MISS ROSA Fannie Mae 's passing was a great loss to us all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't listen to nothing and nobody . Other times she was sweet as sugar . She was caught in a change . Look like you at that bend in the road now . Pay good attention to the road you travel . DAUGHTER Yes ma'am . Grown folks could be so mysterious about certain things . Big Mama and Aunt Mae would bend my ears back about obeying God and my elders . Talk about everybody and everything ' cept my blood mama Fannie Mae . One time I heard somebody say she died from dancin ' . Somebody else I heard say she died from an old wound that was too deep to heal . But when I wanted someone to remember my mama to me , all the begging I could manage would n't move them to talk much about her . p. 45 Act 2 , Scene 6 SCENE FIVE DAUGHTER The morning of the day I was going to the river , Big Mama sent me to Miss Corine 's to get my hair done . I decided that if anybody was going to tell me about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She knew everybody 's business . Because she ran the beauty shop she was in a position to listen in on everybody 's life , first , second and third hand . She was also in a position to give her opinion on a lot of things . Standing over somebody 's head for two or more hours does gain their full attention . A crooked hand-lettered sign was stuck in the corner of her kitchen window announcing : " Miss Corine 's Beauty Shop , We Curl Up And Dye . " Once inside the back door of her kitchen , the strong scent of Sulphur Eight hair grease was like a salve to my soul . I knew I was n't far from a good feeling . Good morning , Miss Corine . MISS CORINE Hey , chile . You ready for your trip to the river ? DAUGHTER Yes ma'am . MISS CORINE C'm on , get up in the chair . Now I 'm just gon na grease and plait it up ' cause we got ta wrap it up real special for the crossing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen . I 'm gon na have to put the hot comb to this . Hold your ear . DAUGHTER Miss Corine , how long you know my blood mama ? p. 46 MISS CORINE Chile , I knowed your mama before she was knee-high to a duck . She worked here in my shop for two years . DAUGHTER Big Mama and Aunt Mae wo n't tell me much about her . They say it hurt too much . But I got ta know what happen to her . Please tell me , Miss Corine . MISS CORINE Your mama 's pride was her long , pretty hair , a good grade and thick , too . Just like yours . Fannie Mae always had her nose stuck in a fashion magazine . If she said it once she said it a thousand times , " Miss Corine , I 'm going to New York and wear dresses like that and when I do my dance everybody gon na scream . " ( FANNIE MAE enters dancing . ) MISS CORINE When she turned fifteen she got a scholarship to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to dancing through the park them white folks claimed was theirs . Some white boys run up behind her . Them boys raped her right there in that park in broad daylight . She fought back , though . When the police come , she carried on so they took her to the mental ward . When they got her in that hospital them animals shaved that poor chile 's head clean . ( MISS CORINE wraps DAUGHTER 's head in a white scarf . ) She bent after that . All your mama ever wanted was to dance . Her dream was to dance all over the world . The closest your mama come to her dream was cleaning up in a dance hall . Now that 's all I know . It was n't a pretty picture but it 's the one I saw . If you do n't remember nothing else your Big Mamas tell you , I want you to remember this , if you got a dance or dream or anything at all , do n't let nothing or nobody get in your way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we all got a dance to do . You remember this , you hear ? ( BIG MAMA enters ) p. 47 DAUGHTER Thank you , Miss Corine . ( DAUGHTER , with head wrapped , goes to BIG MAMA . ) Miss Corine told me about the bad things that happened to my mama . But she did n't tell me how she died . BIG MAMA It was wrong of me not to tell you before now . I been praying for the strength to pass on this part to you . It was like this , Daughter , one morning she called me and told me she dreamed she grew wings . I knew that was a bad sign , so I went up to New York to try to get her to come home so we could heal her . She would n't leave New York . I could already see her slipping away . Just before daybreak she tried to fly . Jumped right out that window . I watched her break into thousand pieces . That 's how we lost her . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You ever been hungry ? You ever need something these women did n't do without to give you ? We love you , Daughter . Any woman can have a baby , but it takes a special woman to be a mama . You remember that , you hear ? DAUGHTER Yes ma'am . ( They embrace and BIG MAMA leads DAUGHTER around the circle of WOMEN singing Yemenjah song . ) MISS MARY I love you , baby . MISS LAMAMA I love you , peaches . AUNT MAE I love you , Daughter . MISS CORINE I love you , little mama . p. 48 MAGGIE I love you , ' lil sister . ( WOMEN hum . ) BIG MAMA " Welcome , Rita , never fear . We are with you , always near . Close to the river , moon bleed through . We will guide you , guide you through . " DAUGHTER Mama ? BIG MAMA I 'm here . DAUGHTER Mama ? AUNT MAE I 'm here . DAUGHTER Mama ? ALL WOMEN We here . ( ALL WOMEN circle DAUGHTER as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAUGHTER and gives her the sheer silver or white scarf from her waist , then exits . DAUGHTER accepts it and begins upbeat " Yemenjah . " WOMEN circle and sing then change to " Yemenjah ah say soo . " BIG MAMA gives DAUGHTER her Bible . ) BIG MAMA I love you , Daughter . ( ALL WOMEN exit . DAUGHTER comes back to present , removes her scarf . Puts on her hat and coat and takes the basket and other gifts , leaves singing . " Yemenjah ah say soo. " )
