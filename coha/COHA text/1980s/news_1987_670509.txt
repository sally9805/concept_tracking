The plan for the units in the West Dallas neighborhood may be the most ambitious attempt in a major city to break up a large concentration of poor blacks and move them to integrated or predominantly white neighborhoods where there are jobs , better educational opportunities and other public services. // The idea , which had its beginnings in residents ' demands to repair the units , is expected to end with the demolition of a complex containing one-third of the city ' s public housing . Although an appeal has been filed , officials say the possibility that the broadly supported settlement may be overturned is so remote that they plan to begin dispersing the tenants in the meantime. // It comes at a time of growing concern that the nation may be developing a permanent class of dependent poor people , largely members of racial minorities concentrated in central cities and plagued by unemployment , crime , drugs and teen-age pregnancy. // // Chance to Try Vouchers // The plan here , developed at a time when more public housing units are being lost each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to demonstrate a program , introduced shortly after President Reagan took office . This involves giving vouchers to low-income families to subsidize their rents in privately owned projects . The Dallas tenants would also receive assistance in finding places to go and in moving. // The Dallas plan grew out of a lawsuit filed last year by a group of low-income blacks against the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development , the Dallas Housing Authority and five suburban municipalities. // The suit charged that the local housing authority , which owns and operates , with Federal subsidies , all public housing units in the city , has historically and routinely assigned poor blacks to the West Dallas units and whites to those scattered throughout the metropolitan area. // At the same time , the plaintiffs charged , the West Dallas units had fallen into such disrepair that many of them were uninhabitable . Their suit was intended to force the city and Federal governments to provide money for repairs , as well as to integrate housing throughout the city. // But before the case could come to trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges , reached a settlement that included destruction of the most run-down units in West Dallas and dispersal of the residents . <> <> ' Monument to Segregation ' // The settlement was reached , according to the Federal District Judge , Jerry Buchmeyer , because of the stark reality that neither the Federal Government , the city nor the private sector would spend enough money on repairs to fulfill the goals of the lawsuit. // " I can not make them do so , " the judge said in accepting the settlement . " If I tried , and I am tempted , it would be still another lie to the people who live in the West Dallas Housing project because it would take less than a month for the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to reverse me. " // He called the West Dallas project " a gigantic monument to segregation and neglect. " // Yet so deep was the distrust of the local and Federal governments that some of the black tenants in West Dallas and a private housing organization , Common Ground , appealed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might fail to provide housing for the poor and that substandard units are better than none at all. // " The 2 , 600 units to be destroyed represent a third of all public housing in Dallas , " said John Fullinwider of Common Ground . " Is this large-scale demolition necessary to stop racial discrimination within the Housing Authority ? " // Under the voucher plan , the tenant is expected to pay 30 percent of his income for rent , just as in Section 8 public housing , and the Federal Government would make up the difference . Only a limited number of vouchers , currently 50 , 000 a year , are issued nationally . In the Dallas case , the Federal department has promised to provide vouchers for all of those displaced from the units destroyed. // The department now pays for the operation of 1. 2 million public units nationally , but puts much more of its resources into 5 million subsidized private units. // Judge Buchmeyer estimates that a majority of the 7 , 000 families in the units will want to leave . <> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes not only from white communities that have resisted integration over the years but also from black leaders who see dispersal as a weakening of political power. // Among these leaders , Marcie Franklin , who formerly served on the Housing Authority , is one of those opposing destruction of any of the units . Asked if black leaders were fearful that destruction of the units would dilute their political power in the city , she said , " Yes , I surely do - there ' s no question about it. " // Objections have also been raised by businesses and churches in West Dallas. // The neighborhood , where 73 percent of the families have incomes of less than $5 , 000 a year , has the largest concentration of blacks in the city . Dallas has a black population of 265 , 000 among its more than 900 , 000 people . <> <> Many Apartments Vacant // The backdrop for this struggle is a city of jarring contrasts that have been enlarged as the local economy falters in the Texas oil bust . With 15 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture and a month ' s rent to new tenants who can afford the $400 to $500 to live in them. // Young , stylishly dressed professionals drive from the sprawling developments - the " metroplexes ' that make up the metropolitan area - to the gleaming office towers of Dallas , many of them half empty as a result of a splurge of building in flush years. // Yet with all the surplus residential and commercial building , 2 , 700 families are on waiting lists for federally subsidized private housing and 650 families for public housing , all of them eligible for aid under welfare laws . And the number of long-term homeless is estimated at 14 , 000 and growing. // The Dallas plan comes after decades of attempts , many unsuccessful , to clear urban slums across the nation . In the 1970 ' s , St. Louis dynamited several large high-rise buildings where conditions had become so intolerable no one wanted to live there . But there was no attempt to disperse the tenants to the suburbs . Most remained in black neighborhoods. // In Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing built in the future , but since then new construction was virtually halted by the Federal Government . The city has had some success in dispersing blacks into subsidized , privately owned projects in the suburbs . But large , high-rise public housing buildings remain in central Chicago , containing virtually all of the minority group members who are on welfare . <> <> ' A Publicly Owned Slum ' // In West Dallas , the public project was built in 1952 to replace what public officials at the time called a " sprawling slum. " // But Judge Buchmeyer said the project was " planned , developed and occupied under an overt policy of racial segregation . " The large body of civil rights law of the 1960 ' s had little effect on the West Dallas situation. // Jack Herrington , executive director of the Dallas Housing Authority , was quoted by Judge Buchmeyer as saying , " More than 8 , 000 adults and children live in a square-mile area which has become , in many respects , a publicly owned slum. " // Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disrepair and many have been boarded up . A few units have been contaminated by a nearby lead smelter that neighborhood groups forced to shut down four years ago. // Judge Buchmeyer said $65 million would be needed to make the apartments livable . The Federal housing department would put up no more than $18 million , and efforts to raise more through the City Council and the private sector failed. // Lawyers for the black plaintiffs concluded that the only recourse was to seek integration of blacks in outlying Dallas communities such as Farmers Branch , Addison , Richardson , Irving and Garland , all named as defendants in the suit as excluding blacks. // All parties to the Dallas settlement agree that if the cycle of poverty , unemployment crime and drugs is to be broken , the poor must be given access to suburban and outlying city areas where jobs and a different cultural environment are available. // Mr. Herrington said in an interview that he had assurances from landlords of subsidized private units where residents are predominantly white that blacks from West Dallas with the housing vouchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " I think we are going to change this town , " he said in an interview . He and the judge said no tenant would be forced to move and , for those who want to stay , some of the units will be repaired. // But some who want to stay expressed distrust for the promises of white civic leaders . In interviews they spoke of community strengths that may be missing in the large expanses of the metroplex where many of the tenants will go. // " We look after each other , " said Mattie Lee Nash , one of the tenants who signed a petition opposing demolition and who serves as a guardian to old and young alike in apartments near hers . " Being poor is in the mind . I don ' t think of us as poor. " //
