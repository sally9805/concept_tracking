With five-sixths of the returns in , the Minister of the Interior , Christian Bonnet , announced that Mr. Giscard d ' Estaing was leading with about 28. 2 percent of the vote and that Mr. Mitterrand ' s share stood at 26. 2 percent. // Though the President ' s showing was not as bad as his supporters had feared , his slim lead confirmed his decline in the last few weeks . Mr. Mitterrand , on the other hand , did unexpectedly well. // The vote , which eliminated eight other contenders , was too close to permit any predictions about the May 10 runoff between the two finalists . <> <> Setback for Communist Party // But the returns did produce one clear and dramatic result : a sharp and unexpected setback for the Communist Party . Georges Marchais , the party leader and its candidate , polled a little over 15 percent of the vote , a sharp drop from the 20 percent that the party has maintained in recent years. // Although the final results may modify the figures , computer projections indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist figure goes to 16 percent , as some of the projections indicated , it would be the lowest share of the vote that the party has won since World War II and would represent a steep fall from the 28 percent it won in the late 1940 ' s . A serious debate is expected within the party about Mr. Marchais ' s continued leadership and policies . <> <> Chirac in Strong Position // Jacques Chirac , the Mayor of Paris and the candidate of the Gaullists , won about 17. 5 percent of the vote . It was less than he had hoped for , but it puts him in a strong position in the bargaining for votes that will go on over the next two weeks. // The voting , which took place under cloudy skies and in rain and even snow in some parts of France , produced a heavy turnout , though it was down somewhat from the 84 percent in the last presidential election seven years ago . Some 82 percent of the registered electorate of 36 million turned up to choose one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposit it in a box before election officials and party representatives. // It was an almost uniformly peaceful process , after a campaign that notably failed to arouse strong passions or uncover any very striking issues . Interest will presumably increase now , given the closeness of Mr. Giscard d ' Estaing ' s and Mr. Mitterrand ' s scores and the difficulty in predicting the swing among the 46 percent of the voters who supported other candidates in the first round . <> <> Appeal to Mayor ' s Supporters // The complexity of the electoral situation over the next two weeks tended to mute the comments of the major candidates and their supporters. // Mr. Giscard d ' Estaing thanked his supporters for putting him in the lead and called on other groups - by implication , Mr. Chirac ' s followers - to help him in the battle against Mr. Mitterrand. // Several of the President ' s campaign aides expressed satisfaction that Mr. Giscard d ' Estaing had done better than recent polls predicted he would , but they did not deny that his popularity had dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitterrand , looking grave enough to befit a poor showing , thanked his supporters for giving him a victory bigger than he had expected . His aides hailed " the biggest success ever won by the French Socialist Party " but would not say how their candidate would get sufficient support from other voters to beat Mr. Giscard d ' Estaing. // The situation confronting the finalists is a knotty one . If all the votes of the right - Mr. Chirac ' s and those of two minor candidates , Michel Debre and Marie-France Garaud - were to go to Mr. Giscard d ' Estaing , he would draw 49. 1 percent in the runoff . Similarly , if the Communist vote and the votes of three minor leftist candidates went to Mr. Mitterrand , he would have 47 percent. // The swing vote would then be held by the 4 percent of the voters who supported Brice Lalonde , the Ecologist candidate , yesterday . Mr.Lalonde said last night that he would endorse neither candidate . <> <> Abstentions Could Shift Balance // One real question is whether a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward on May 10 and alter the balance . Much more important is the question of how many of Mr. Giscard d ' Estaing ' s natural supporters , the Chirac voters , will actually vote for him , and how many Communists will vote for Mr. Mitterrand. // There is considerable tension between the Chirac camp and Mr. Giscard d ' Estaing . Mr. Chirac , who has spent the last five weeks calling Mr. Giscard d ' Estaing incompetent , said last night that he would announce today whom he will support. // There is little doubt that he will back Mr. Giscard d ' Estaing , but the Chirac leadership , now a stronger force in French politics , may not campaign actively for the President . Token support would leave many of their supporters abstaining or even voting for Mr. Mitterrand. // It is widely expected that the degree of enthusiasm shown for the President by the Chirac organization will depend on the results of bargaining over the group ' s power in a future government . <> <> Voting ' With Resignation ' // One Chirac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Estaing in 1974 in " a spirit of hope " but that anyone who voted for him this year would do so " with resignation . " Presumably it would depend on the considerable campaign abilities demonstrated by Mr. Chirac and his men to transform resignation into something more useful to the President. // However Mr. Chirac ' s aides may feel , it is not clear that they can deliver more than a part of their following . Hostility to Mr. Giscard d ' Estaing , partly because of economic difficulties and partly because his style strikes many as arrogant , is widespread and may be hard to overcome. // Mr. Mitterrand ' s problems may be even more serious . The Socialist Party , allied with the Communists seven years ago , is now an all-out rival . It is likely that the truculent , pro-Soviet leadership of Mr. Marchais has driven many Communists to support Mr. Mitterrand . Others would probably support him as the only alternative to Mr. Giscard d ' Estaing . <> <> Erosion of Communist Power // But it is not clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party has grown steadily at the expense of the Communist Party , and if the Socialists should take power , the Communist position could be eroded still further . If the Communist leadership decides to encourage abstention , the party discipline is such that a good part of its membership would be likely to respond. // At a press conference late last night , Mr. Marchais , looking shaken though not completely devoid of his usual bounciness , said a decision would be made early this week by the party ' s Politburo . He denounced Mr. Mitterrand for conducting " a shameful duet " with Mr. Giscard d ' Estaing , meaning that both oppose the Communists , and he repeated his vow that the Communist Party would not support any government in which it did not participate. // Mr. Mitterrand has made it fairly clear that he will not appoint Communist ministers . However , since a government is not formed until a president is elected , Mr. Marchais would still have an out if the Communists decided to support Mr. Mitterrand. // With all the uncertainties , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident was a quarrel between Mr. Giscard d ' Estaing and Mr. Mitterrand about the format of a televised debate . Mr. Giscard d ' Estaing , who comes across well on television , wants two debates , with the candidates sitting across a table from each other. // Mr. Mitterrand , feeling at a disadvantage , maintains that one debate is enough and that the debaters should stand as far apart as possible , each with his own podium. //
