Phil finished 18th and Steve ninth , but on this day the numbers really didn ' t matter , for in a few moments Phil had his wife by his side , his daughter on his back , and his 17-day-old son in his arms . This day , that was the victory . For after a decade of international ski racing , the Mahre brothers are turning from the rigors of constant travel to the joys of family life. // They ' ve earned it . The public knows of the Olympic gold and silver medals Phil and Steve won last month in Sarajevo . The public also knew of Phil ' s silver medal in 1980 . But the skiing world has known them as two of the world ' s best racers for the last eight years. // ' ' Phil was born four minutes ahead of me , ' ' Steve says , ' ' and I ' ve been chasing him ever since. ' ' // The chase started on the slopes of White Pass , Wash. , where their father manages a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ' s most glamorous resorts so many times , they ' re returning to Yakima , Wash. , where they ' ll again occasionally be able to ski that same White Pass area where they spent their childhood chasing each other down the hill and through bamboo poles. // The twins burst on the World Cup scene in the 1976-77 season after skiing without any particular success at the Innsbruck Olympics the previous winter . In December , 1976 , Phil won a giant slalom at Val d ' Isere , France . Two months later , he won a World Cup slalom in Sun Valley , Idaho , with Steve coming in third . For the first time in many years , the European skiing establishment had an American threat to worry about. // The concern turned out to be justified - for despite their reputation for relaxed training in the summer ( they raced motocross competitively and are avid water-skiers ) , the Mahres worked at least as hard as anyone else during the season , often sidestepping up the mountain on dark winter mornings to run gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid off. // In 1978 , when they got the Europeans on American snow again , Phil and Steve won on successive days at Stratton Mountain , Vt . Phil went on that year to finish second in the overall standings to his career-long rival , Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden. // In 1979 things looked even brighter . Changes in the point-scoring system gave the edge to more versatile skiers like Mahre , who also races the downhill , rather than specialists like Stenmark , who does not . But at Lake Placid , while closing in on his first overall title and also looking ahead toward the next year ' s Olympics at the same site , Phil hooked a tip on one of those thousands of gates ( bamboo poles ) he runs each year , sustaining a serious leg injury that ended his season . The Olympics , only a year away , seemed out of reach , and in fact his entire skiing career was in doubt. // But Phil ' s attitude was positive . He joked that this was the only way he could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so , he worked harder than ever to get back in shape for the Olympic year . It paid off , too , as he took the slalom silver at Lake Placid and went on to finish third in the World Cup standings. // The next winter both twins were so hot that it sometimes seemed if Phil didn ' t win , Steve did . Coming down to the end of the season , Phil had to finish first or second in a slalom at Borovetz , Bulgaria to clinch that elusive first World Cup overall title . He would have , but he finished third because Steve beat him. // The Europeans were aghast . ' ' They couldn ' t understand why a brother would keep his brother from winning the World Cup , ' ' Phil said , ' ' but I would never pull off the course to let him win , and he would never do the same , either. ' ' // Phil clinched the title the next week , though , to give the story a happy ending , while Steve came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his World Cup championship , becoming the first racer to clinch the title in January , with Stenmark eventually coming in second and Steve third . Steve upstaged his brother , though , at the 1982 world championships , winning the giant slalom to become the first American male ever to earn a skiing gold medal in Olympic or world championship competition. // Stenmark is generally considered the greatest slalom and giant slalom skier in history . And yet , despite the distraction of also racing downhill , Phil beat the great Swede at his own game in that 1981-82 season , winning both the slalom and giant slalom titles as well as the overall crown. // Last year , Phil hadn ' t won a single race when the circuit came to America in the spring , but his willingness to race flat out at speeds above 80 m. p. h. in the downhill had kept him in the running for a third consecutive title anyway . He eventually got it , too , by winning his last three giant slaloms of the year. // Phil amazes the downhillers because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without training for it . He just puts on the skis and runs it - full tilt . The next day he puts on his shorter giant slalom and slalom skis and wins races . Only a handful of skiers have been able to do this competitively , and the youngest of them , Switzerland ' s Pirmin Zurbriggen , seems sure to beat the perennially tough Stenmark for this year ' s overall title. // Except for their big day at Sarajevo , this has been a bad year for the Mahres on the World Cup circuit : Phil is 11th and Steve 43rd in the standings. // ' ' The World Cup circuit just isn ' t the place to raise a family , ' ' Phil said. // Steve ' s wife , Debbie , and his daughter , Ginger , traveled with him the last two years , while Phil ' s wife , Holly , was forced to stay at home this year , expecting their second child . She gave birth to Alexander an hour before the Olympic slalom , and later Phil touched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his voice broke while trying to explain how he longed to be with them. // In that Olympic slalom , Steve led after the first run , but Phil , racing ahead of him on the second run , took the lead . Phil stopped , grabbed a walkie-talkie , and radioed up to Steve with instructions on how to ski the course - telling his brother , in other words , how to ski to beat him for the gold medal. // Steve went all out , but caught an edge and lost just enough time that he he finished two tenths a second behind Phil. // ' ' We have a saying , ' ' Steve said : ' ' Keep it in the family . ' ' They certainly did on that day . And both twins have certainly earned the opportunity they ' re going to take now to spend more time with their own families in the years ahead. // //
