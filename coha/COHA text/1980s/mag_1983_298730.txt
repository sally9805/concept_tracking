Shades of Fomer Glory <P> Once again workers were marching through the streets of Gdansk , shouting out the name of Solidarity and flourishing their familiar V signs , and once again Lech Walesa was walking at their head . As the passionate faithful , 3,000 strong , neared the town 's 151-foot monument to workers slain in 1970 , they were stopped by a cordon of security police . Walesa and his bodyguard were permitted to pass . Advancing to the monument , the stocky electrician knelt before its three towering steel crosses and gently laid at its base a bouquet of red and pink gladioli . Then , flanked by security police , Walesa slowly raised his right hand in the defiant V sign . <P> That symbolic gesture marked the third anniversary of the founding of the now outlawed independent trade union Solidarity .
