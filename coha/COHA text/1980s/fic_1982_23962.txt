) 11Ir 41 ? ' 31. * The Millet Of T/ae Bird A story . by Jorge Amado T HE MIRACLE occurred on a lively market day in Piranhas , a town on the Sao Francisco River in the state of Alagoas , Brazil . It was witnessed by hundreds of townspeople , running the social gamut from a rich colonel named Jarde Ramaho , who had seen action against Lampi5o , the Bandit of the Backlands , to dirt farmers in town for the day to sell their manioc flour and fresh-picked corn . An illustrious visitor who was being f  --  ted that day in Piranhas , the widow of our great regional novelist Graciliano Ramos , saw it too ; and since Dona Heloisa Ramos is notoriously truthful , her testimony alone should be enough to prove the veracity of my tale . The protagonist in this affair was Ubaldo CapaMei ? , known far and wide for his competence in the three trades of lover , minstrel , and composer of popular ballads , which were printed up in leaflets and pinned to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antagonist was Captain Lindolfo Ezequiel , whose reputation for primitive courage and cruelty was a byword in the state of Alagoas , where men are undeniably men . Exactly what kind of captain he was is unclear . but everyone knew he had earned his stripes by dispatching other men to the graveyard . The two occupations for which he was famous were those of hired killer , which paid well and Jorge Amado lives in Salvador Bahia , Brazil . His most recent novel , Tieta , was published by Knopf in 1979 . This story is translated from the Portuguese by Barbara MereHo. earned him respect , and husband to Sab6 ? a position requiring uncommon ability , energy , and constant violent threats to the masculine population . For SabO , if truth be told , respected neither her husband 's military rank nor his ugly scowl and the lethal weapon he wore . SabO flaunted herself in front of all the men and figured in the dreams of every last one of them ( including boys under fourteen ) whether single , married , engaged , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to risk arousing the captain 's murderous masculine pride and an unceremonious death from the barrel of a gun was SabO herself . All the men who were hot for her ground their teeth , tucked their tails between their legs , and turned their eyes away from Sab ( i the siren . All but Ubaldo CapadOcio . Not because he was reckless or brave as a lion , but out of sheer ignorance of local custom . After all , he was only a stranger passing through in search of readers and a bustling marketplace where he could sell the ballads he had composed ( the latest of which , " The Story of the Society Lady Who Fell in Love With a Werewolf , " was selling like hotcakes , and deserved lo ) ; a party where he could play his concertina and improvise verses ; and an inviting bed where he could rest from his labors and snuggle up to a pretty brunette . Whatever his motive , the fact is that he did brave the bully , and what 's more he did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SabO 's pink baby-doll pajamas , to be exact . U BALDO CAPADOCTO the minstrel was a heartbreaker and a fine figure of a man : tall , lean , and nimble , with a tousled mop of hair and an easy laugh . A gifted conversationalist in any company , he knew how to season his talk with wit and learning ; wherever he found himself an animated circle formed instantly around him . All through the vast back country of Bahia and Sergipe where he worked , worried . and loved , Ubaldo was loved in return and his talents were always in demand . He was showered with invitations to enliven christenings , weddings , and wakes ; he had no equal when it came to toasting a bride and bridegroom , or telling stories at a wake that could make a dead man laugh or cry . And that 's no idle expression . It really happened and I could round up plenty of live witnesses to prove it . I 'll mention just two of them here : master artist Calasans Neto and Florisvaldo Matos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aristdbulo Negritude burst out in a horse laugh , right where he lay dead as a doornail in his coffin , when Ubaldo Capacl6eio told the story of the beached whale in Maragogipe . I wo n't ask my friend Carybe the painter to testify because everybody knows he 's a liar . The way he tells it , Negritude did n't just laugh , he added a dirty twist to the story as well . But those of us in the know say it was Carybe  --  no upstanding citizen  --  who put in the smutty details himself . AristObulo may have been a know-it-all but he drew the line at butting in on another man 's story ; he knew how a proper corpse ought to behave . It was at shindigs that Ubaldo really shone . Concertina clasped to his breast , husky voice soaked in rum , languorous imploring eyes , fingers sliding sensuously over the keys , with his playing he charmed sighs and promises from young girls , married women , kept women , fallen women , disconsolate widows ( consoling widows came naturally to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deep sighs and ardent promises there was usually a barrage of threats and curses , but Ubaldo was no coward and just plowed right ahead . Wanderer though he was , he had a house and home  --  several houses and homes  --  in Bahia and Sergipe . Why not , with his good looks and his reputation ? So many women and Ubaldo was true to all of them , for his was a faithful , constant heart . He never broke off with a woman ( except for Braulia , but Braulia , for heaven 's sake ... ! ) , never sent one away . They left of their own accord , loudly claiming they had been used and betrayed , when they found out about all the others  --  though how abstinence could be expected of a romantic wandering bard away from home for weeks and months at a time I do n't know . These abrupt partings were never CapadOcio 's idea and they always made him unhappy . Whenever a woman left him he felt as if he were losing the only one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each one was the only one , and if that riddle baffles you then you do n't know much about love . What could be the cause of such repeated ingratitude , such unreasoning selfishness , when he , Ubaldo CapadOcio , could always be counted on as a breadwinner , a prop , and a mainstay to his women , with more than enough skill and imagination to satisfy them all and to spare ? Some women , in fact , did n't abandon him but took him the way he was . Which explains why , at the time of the miracle in Piranhas , Ubaldo CapaclOcio , at thirty-two years of age , was maintaining three families on his earnings as a popular poet , balladeer , and musician . What with his concertina and his guitar , his husky voice and his rhymes  --  rich rhymes or poor , it did n't matter  --  it was poetry that put food on the table for his three wives , none of them lawfully wedded , and nine children , three of whom were not his . Two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , while the third had not yet produced any offspring , For Rosecler , the new addition , who was still in the honeymoon stage , it was too early for pregnancy and birth ; Ubaldo spent more on the rings , bracelets , necklaces , and other baubles she loved than on either of the other two ; in return Rosecler gave him passionate tenderness , a mixture of honey and pepper . U BALDO CAPADOCIO , then , was running over with rhymes and with children , only half a dozen of whom , as we 've said , were his by blood : three with Romilda , three with Valdelice . Of the three adopted boys , the eldest came with Romilda when this handsome mulatto woman decided to leave her husband behind his counter in Aracaju and follow the plangent chords of the lonely troubadour 's guitar . Yes , lonely and forlorn , because when a man wants a certain woman  --  when he 's so hungry for her he ca n't get her out of his mind  --  even if he 's playing around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be alone ; that one confounded woman is the only companion who can cheer him up and cure him of his lonesome blues . Seeing him brought so low , Romilda softened and bundled up her things , but first she told him she was willing to leave her husband but not her little boy ; that she could n't be separated from him . " He 'll be my son , " swore CapadOcio dramatically with his hand on his heart . He did n't care whether she brought along one child , three children , or four ; it was all the same to him , he was so crazy to get Romilda into bed , touch her breasts , stroke her thighs . " Bring your little boy , bring your nephew , bring your whole family if you want to ! " The second boy , named Dante after the poet , was adopted by CapadOcio and Valdelice after his mother died , leaving the six-month-old baby with a fierce case of dysentery . Entrusting him to his father was out of the question . Bernardo Sabenca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar companions under the table , had no aptitude whatever for child-rearing , especially when the child had loose bowels and stank . As for the third boy , nicknamed Cavy because he shared that rodent 's voracious appetite , they knew nothing at all about him  --  parents , age , name  --  but had simply picked him up by the side of a back-country road eating clay , which is n't nourishing but tastes pretty good . After a close examination of Cavy 's features and ways  --  fair hair , blue eyes , clever hands that were quick to grasp any object within reach  --  Valdelice , who was something of an amateur psychologist , concluded that his father must have been a lordly landowner , a " doctor , " and that he had inherited his dark complexion from his mother . For those who want more precise information about CapadOcio 's family life , I 'll just add that he sometimes resided with the fair Romilda in Lagarto in the state of Sergipe , while the Valdelice-CapadOcio residence was in Baraimas Alley , Amargosa , Bahia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suburb of a big city , Jequie . Ubaldo CapadOcio kissed his three wives with a cheery " So long , see you soon " ( no one but a dead man on the way to his funeral ought to say the word " goodbye " ) and set off to make his fortune in the famous state of Alagoas , where life is cheap but poetry is prized ; where a talented minstrel can reap applause , earn good money , and , if he 's brave enough , warm the bed of some fine brunettes . BALDO 'S expedition into the rugged Ala- , goan backlands was going splendidly . At parties , fairs , christenings , even a bishop 's pastoral mission to Arapiraca , Ubaldo CapadOcio turned up with his concertina , his guitar . and a suitcase full of ballads all ready to hang on the line , raking in a fair harvest of coins and breaking hearts right and left . After some time he reached the Sdo Francisco River and made his way along 44j1 t 3fit ? its banks until he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the beauty of its setting , for its colonial houses , and for having stood fast against Lampido 's band years ago , a feat sung in many a ballad of the time . Yet another source of local pride was the fact that the town sheltered within its unbreached stone walls the aforementioned Captain Lindolfo Ezequiel and his legal wife , Saba , also aforementioned but clearly deserving more ample reference to her graceful form , her dancing walk , a rear end that was a living legend , the dimples in her cheeks , and the way the hussy bit her lips to make them redder , as if saying , Oh yes , I 'd like to , ooh , I wish I could , and so on and so forth . SabC ) was n't a woman at all , she was a temptation of the devil turned loose in Piranhas . But what man was reckless enough to give in ? Yes , Piranhas was the home of the brave , the dauntless , the bold  --  Lampido could have borne witness to that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair number of his neighbors to the other world , some at the behest of powerful men , in order to make good money for himself and his free-spending wife , and others on his own hook because he mistrusted their intentions toward the virtuous Sabii . In the mind of her just but jealous husband , SabO was a snow-white dove . Our troubadour , Ubaldo Capadacio , had been in trouble over women more than once . He had jumped out of windows , jumped over fences , jumped over walls , streaked through the bushes , burst into other people 's houses yelling for help , and plunged headlong into the Paraguassu River . One time a bullet had dusted his jacket but Xange , his powerful spirit guide , protected him . Actually , since the would-be avenger was a military man and a sharpshooter , Ubaldo was never in much danger of being hit . As soon as he got to Piranhas he made for SabO 's bed , which also belonged , by right of lawful marriage lines from priest and judge , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be off on a short business trip to a distant town , where a congressman had a little job for him to do . " Coast is clear , " poor little Sabo called softly , so anxious to make the most of her chance . Not that Ubaldo had n't been given fair warning from a fellow versifier , the owner of the pension where he was staying : " Better stay clear , pal , Lindolfo has more than thirty notches on his gun , not counting the first few before he started hiring himself out as a professional . " Ubaldo did n't put much stock in what he heard ; he knew what braggarts Alagoans are , and besides , to him women were always worth taking risks for . He crossed Sabefs threshold at nightfall and was seen . He was still there the next morning when the sun was high in the sky ; the affectionate girl could n't get enough of him and as for the balladeer , when he found a partner worthy of his mettle he liked to show off  --  not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refinements and skill .
