Flames charred a bakery and more than 20 nearby houses . The street in front of the warehouse was covered with a knee-high layer of bricks and other wreckage , and clouds of black smoke billowed over the neighborhood , about a mile east of Lake Erie. // // // ' Like a Car Hit the House ' // Tabitha Trotter , who lives in a two-story house next to the warehouse with her mother , uncle and 99-year-old grandfather , was three blocks away when the explosion shook the neighborhood .

" // Mary Summers , an official of the Greater Buffalo chapter of the American Red Cross , said that moments after the blasts , walls began collapsing in the neighborhood . " It was almost like a bomb had hit them , " she said. // The blasts occurred about 8 : 30 P.M. after firefighters had been called to the area near the Sam-Son Distribution Corporation ' s warehouse , at North Division and Grosvenor Streets , a five-story structure in a neighborhood of two- story frame homes . Officials said they did not know what had been stored in the warehouse. // Fire officials said the first casualties were apparently firefighters trapped by the explosions . They had been sent to the area after the department received a report of a liquid propane leak near the warehouse . It was not immediately clear what ignited the propane or whether the explosions at the warehouse were touched off by the gas leak. // The explosions apparently caught the firefighters searching for the gas leak by surprise . Wooden ladders on their fire trucks ignited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , and walls crumbled , trapping firefighters inside. // The Ellicott County Medical Examiner ' s office said that as of 1 A.M. today four firefighters were known to have died . But the Fire Commissioner said the toll might have been higher. // " We lost five and we can ' t find four , " the Fire Commissioner , Fred D. Langdon , said. // The Red Cross said 37 homes and 12 apartments in two nearby buildings had been damaged or destroyed . The agency set up a shelter for those whose homes had been destroyed and began passing out coffee , milk , sandwiches and blankets to people who had been withdrawn after officials turned off electricity and disconnected natural gas to homes in the neighborhood. // Five victims , most of them with fractures , were admittted to Columbus Hospital , a mile from the warehouse . One died later in the emergency room. // More than 40 severely burned patients were admitted to Sheehan Memorial Hospital , five blocks from the explosion . Patients with other injuries were transferred to other hospitals . Erie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two were taken to Buffalo General. // The two explosions ripped through the warehouse shortly after the firefighters arrived , and flames spread rapidly from block to block . <> <> ' The Flames Were Everywhere ' // " The flames were everywhere , " one witness said . " You could turn around and see houses burning down the block . The adjoining buildings that were not completely leveled looked like they had been pulled apart. " // The explosion blew out the walls of two churches , three blocks from the warehouse , and the fire covered a mile- square area with thick clouds of black smoke . Christmas wreaths and tinsel were knocked off the doors of wood- frame porches in the neighborhood. // A firefighter , Robert Hartman , said that , when he arrived on the fourth alarm , he saw " a sea of fire . " Sarah Hampton , who lives across the street from the warehouse , said she was washing dishes in her kitchen sink when the lights went off and there was " a big noise . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flames , " she said . Her own dining room " was full of wood and stuff , " and Lizzie Preston , who lives with her , was trapped under some rubble. // " I tried to pull the stuff off of her , but I just couldn ' t pull it off , " Miss Hampton said . " Then I went out and screamed , ' Get her out ! Get her out ! ' " Officials at the scene said streets in the area had not been cleared after a three-foot snowstorm on Monday , and ambulances became stuck in drifts . Paramedics asssisted by members of the Guardian Angels struggled to push the ambulances through the snow so they could carry victims to local hospitals. // As 20 men pushed one ambulance through the snow , a woman beat on the window , shouting , " Where ' s Harry , where ' s Harry . " Down the street , one observer said , a hook-and-ladder truck lay crippled , its roof crushed but its windshield wipers still moving back and forth . <> <> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Deputy Fire Commmissioner Al Hertzeg crawled on his stomach through the wreckage , peering under fire trucks with a searchlight , looking for more victims. // Mayor James Griffin toured the neighborhood shortly after the explosion and said he thought that more fire vehicles might have been ruined by falling debris. // The blast forced the police to block off the area near the warehouse as officials struggled to evacuate the neighborhood . Two hours after the explosions , several houses were still burning in the vicinity of the warehouse and firefighters said they did not know if anyone was trapped inside. // Three hours after the explosion , officials at the scene said they feared the death toll could rise as high as 20 . None of the victims had been identified . <> <> Raging Out of Control // The flames raged out of control for more than three hours . Commissioner Langdon said the blaze was brought under control at midnight , but the fire was still smoldering and firefighters feared that some of the material in the warehouse could be re-ignited. // At least five fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area. //
