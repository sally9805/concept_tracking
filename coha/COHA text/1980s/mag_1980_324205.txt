Voters explain why they abandoned Kennedy for Carter <P> Before he announced his presidential candidacy . Senator Edward Kennedy led President Carter by 2-to-1 in a poll conducted for TIME by the public opinion research firm of Yankelovich , Shelly and White , Inc . But in the latest survey , taken in late January , that ranking was stunningly reversed . To find out what caused so many people to change their minds , TIME correspondents across the nation interviewed a sampling of the ex-Kennedy supporters who had been polled by Yankelovich . Most of them now lean toward Carter . <P> The Kennedy name . The remembrance of things past , of Jack and Bobby , not as they were but as they now seem to have been . That was Ted Kennedy 's biggest political asset when he started his campaign in November . Explained Pharmacist Ken Dockter , 23 , in Grafton , N.D. : " Right away you think of John Kennedy and Robert Kennedy and you kind of get pulled into it . " Said Leroy Allen , 52 , a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy in 1960 : " Who can lead us to the promised land ? Everybody 's looking for Moses . " Boston University Political Science Major Robert Aleknas , 21 , thought Kennedy was the ideal man " to turn things around economically at home and with other countries abroad . " <P> Now Aleknas , like many other voters , is asking : " Why did I think that ? " Indeed , the Camelot legacy is turning out to be one of Kennedy 's biggest handicaps , as many voters learn that he is not living up to their mythic memories of his brothers . Said Aleknas : " I was looking at the name and not the man . I realize that now . " Said Steelworker Allen : " Strength is what we 're seeking , and you have to ask , ' How much strength does the man have ? ' " Tren Miller , 30 , a high school science teacher in La Vista , Neb. , had hoped that the " Kennedy excitement would come forth again . It did n't , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics as long as he has , he should be more articulate . " Others were surprised at how ill-prepared Kennedy seemed at many appearances . Said Glenn Kinduell , 27 , an industrial-cleanser salesman in Fort Wayne , Ind. : " He seems more mortal now . " <P> Many Kennedy backers began switching to Carter during the Iranian crisis . Said Detroit Air Traffic Clerk Betsy McCamman , 29 : " It 's not what Carter did , it 's what he did n't do . He did n't overreact . " Then Kennedy dismayed still other backers by attacking deposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi . To James Schroeder , 33 , a hotel bellman in Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , this was " dirty pool . " Said he : " If anything , Kennedy should have attacked the militants . He should have supported the President . " Complained Richard Maynard , 30 , a high school social studies teacher in Philadelphia : " There was a move for national unity , and Kennedy was n't in touch with that at all .
