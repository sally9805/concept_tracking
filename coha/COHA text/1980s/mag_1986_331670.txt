" I 'm a great gossip . Do n't pay any attention to what I 'm saying . " Alec Guinness , relaxing over lunch in Manhattan , is engaging in his favorite hobby : teasing . In fact , he is a great gossip , and it is impossible not to pay attention to what he says . During the past half-century or so , he has played dozens of memorable roles : a Prime Minister ( Disraeli ) , a Pope ( Innocent III ) , a King ( Charles I ) , a prince ( Arabia 's Faisal ) , a fanatical colonel ( Nicholson , in The Bridge on the River Kwai ) , a mad dictator ( Hitler ) , a Jedi knight ( Obi-wan Kenobi ) and a spymaster ( George Smiley in TV adaptations of John le Carre 's espionage sagas ) . Now , at 71 , he has added another role to that impressive list : author of one of the best show-business memoirs of recent years , a witty , wise and consistently entertaining account of life under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's title , but the blessings in this all- too-short autobiography ( Knopf ; $17.95 ) wear no masks . Along with an engaging picture of Guinness himself , there are candid and almost always hilarious portraits of some of those he has met along the way to his threescore and eleven : George Bernard Shaw , Tyrone Guthrie , Edith Evans , Martita Hunt , Noel Coward and even Ernie Kovacs , who , he says , was " just about the funniest man I have ever met . " <P> One afternoon during the filming of Our Man in Havana , in which Kovacs played a corrupt police chief , Sir Alec passed the comedian 's hotel room . The door was open , and Kovacs was sitting at a desk and typing furiously , surrounded by half a dozen naked girls reading magazines . " Shall I shut your door ? " Guinness politely suggested . " No ! For heaven 's sakes ! " replied Kovacs . " What would people say ? They 'd say Kovacs is in that room with a bunch of naked broads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door open they can see for themselves it 's all perfectly innocent . " <P> Although the knighthood was granted in 1959 , Guinness does not consider himself on the same level as England 's great aristocrats of the theater : John Gielgud , Laurence Olivier and the late Ralph Richardson . " I 'm just not , " he says . " It 's as simple as that . It does n't worry me . I never pretended to be . " But he has known and , with characteristic detachment , admired all three . <P> Gielgud directed a Hamlet in which Guinness had a small part , and he can still hear that berating voice  --  " like a silver trumpet muffled in silk . " " Go away , " he told Guinness crossly . " Come back in a week . Get someone to teach you how to act . " Guinness did nothing except mope for seven days , but his absence was enough . Gielgud was now delighted with the young actor 's new interpretation . <P> Perhaps the most endearing portrait is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vic production of Richard II , Sir Ralph had only a few words of advice . Holding up a sharpened pencil , he said , " Play it like this pencil , old cock . " Guinness admits that he was not greatly illuminated , and his Richard was a failure of which he is still ashamed .
