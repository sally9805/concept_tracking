 | Few articles published in U.S.News &; World Report have resulted in such an outpouring of letters as the story about " Troubled Teenagers " in the December 14 issue . The vast majority of correspondents were young people ? some criticizing the article , some agreeing with it , others telling of their experiences or offering advice on how problems of teen-agers should be approached . Together , the writers present valuable insights into the motivations of America 's younger generation . Following are excerpts from some of the letters . Massachusetts . I read your article on troubled teenagers and I started crying . I just turned 13 , and I tried pot on my 13th birthday . A friend tried to commit suicide recently . She is becoming a diet-pill addict and is already on her way to getting anorexia nervosa . I 'm scared . In your article , it seems to me you 're trying to find someone to blame . You ca n't do that . There 's no one . Adolescence is the sort of thing you have to suffer through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they help me , which makes me try to help other people . From what I told you at the beginning of the letter , you would think I lived in a city slum or terrible , awful place . I do n't . I live in a suburb , sail all summer and am up for application into major boarding and nonboarding schools in New England . Why did I try pot at 13 , when I have better things to do ? I do n't know . I wish someone would tell me . My parents are great . I have a great life , and I get stoned every weekend . Wonderful life ? Wish I knew . This letter may make no sense to you , but let another kid in my position read it and they 'll understand . It seems as if I have to carry everyone 's problems on my shoulders , and sometimes I just want to break down ! And sometimes I do . And then I feel so guilty about dumping it on my parents , and it starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do . I truly sound like I 'm completely screwed up , but I 'm not . I just want to know WHY ? Why was I born having emotions that make me cry when other people do ? I keep on asking myself " The team goes into why I try pot and alcohol , and I ca n't celebrates with a win answer . It seems to me that you have to have a certain amount of status to try pot , smoke or drink . Many friends WANT to get hooked on booze . It 's sick . California . When I saw the cover of your December 14 issue , I laughed ! The middle-class , fascist parents who read your articles can blame only themselves if there is any " problem " with their teen-agers ' behavior . Breaking away from the ignorant " normality " and " morality " of our parents is the only hope we have of coming out sane , healthy human beings . So do n't ask why . Just look at yourselves , people ! Tacoma , Wash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teens must contend with in the process of maturing to " adulthood . " The inescapable pressures exerted by peers to conform are often too much to handle . The only answer to the problem is a source the teen can draw his strength from in combatting the pressures of " bad " influences . This strength can come only from the home . A strong home yields strong character . Weak homes produce kids unable to defend themselves against peer pressure , and who are inevitably sucked in . I have seen it happen too many times . Sacramento . I can not understand a sophisticated magazine 's view of youth today . Your article is far too negative to many youths . It focuses on the most extreme cases of teenage delinquency and tries to present them as examples of American youth . I am a 16-year-old American and also a punk-rock fan , but I am not a bizarre dresser , and I am definitely not alienated and hostile . Your article is preceded by an article on the decline of the rock-music business . Are you trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linked ? Please do n't fall for that old myth . Little Rock . What do you mean by the " demented " and " hostile " subculture of punk rock ? If we really are " alienated , " it 's because shallow journalism has made us feel that way . Come out of your shell of bigotry for a moment and you 'll realize that " punks " are the only ones who really know what 's going on . If " bizarre dress and behavior " is synonymous with an " alienated and hostile subculture , " then we all had better fear the Amish people as well . Ohio . Troubled teen-agers are only a result of troubled parents . Why are they unhappy ? Because they are leaving God out of the scene . A happy home is one that is made up of born-again parents who teach their children to fear God and love His ways . The secret to raising healthy , happy children is to teach them and rear them in the path of righteousness . ( From a 15-year-old ) Illinois . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drugs and alcohol . It 's disgusting ! What can be done about it ? Well , my grandfather taught me that , when putting out a fire , aim the hose at the base of the flame . We have to go to the source of the problem . We need the police to find the pot before it is in the light user 's hands . In the two following instances , you see not only that " burnouts " are into drugs , but how easy it is for drugs to find their way into young hands . I have seen it happen before my eyes . A basketball team wins the game . After the game , the team goes into the locker room and celebrates with a winning joint . Several kids are sitting on the roadside looking for action . An old , beat-up car drives up , and the man inside hands one of the kids a speed-lined joint . " Tell ' em Santa Claus was here , " the man says . If Santa started bringing me that stuff , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem . I asked 20 friends if they had ever tried any . Five had , but decided not to continue to use them . Alcohol had hit all 20 ; seven had gone on and used it regularly . If adults work with kids , we can work it out . Texas . I am a 19-year-old who kept a bottle under the front seat of the car the last two years of high school . While reading your special report , " Troubled Teenagers , " a single thought came to mind : You can get every psychologist in the book to dig up examples and statistics and all you have are examples and statistics . I appreciate your effort , but just look at it this way : Post-World War II parents started in the world of liberal giveaways while trying to keep up the harsh discipline that they grew up with ? a " free world " and a prison at home . The rebellious teen-agers of the ' 50s and ' 60s went to " loveins " and became the confused parents of the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vietnam blew away the glory and majesty of the leader of the free world . The economy is shot , the family unit is in trouble , respect for authority is a joke . For the right price , you can buy yourself a senator or a judge , or he is out buying himself a 16-year-old to use for a couple of hours . The Russians are invading anything and everything at will . Money is worthless , but you 're worthless without it . If the social scientists wo n't figure us out , maybe they should try to grow up in the world we 've been stuck in under a parent 's generation that did n't give a damn . Knowing why things happen might satisfy your curiosity , but it does n't do us any good . Stop worrying about why your son needs a drink before he can face his morning classes , or why your daughter went out and got pregnant . Just help them cope with the reality of it . Before throwing us into categories , just remember that we have got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off or retire and starve on Social Security . I leave it up to you : Either give us a little help and understanding , or put the world out of its misery and send up the missiles , and hope Mother Nature has better luck with the next thing that crawls up out of the slime . Philadelphia . I participate in the punk-rock scene , and I do n't know anyone who fits your description . I see a lot of young people trying to be unique in a society that teaches unoriginalityin its school systems , lacks imagination and is stuck in a monotonous , boring rut . Just because our musical tastes differ from the majority 's does n't mean we are mentally unstable . After all , not everyone can love Frank Sinatra . Syracuse , N.Y . As an 18-year-old college freshman , I am a product of the " me first , do your own thing " era , as you have labeled it . My friends are the so-called wayward children you write about . Your article does a tremendous disservice to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young adults who are not junkies , runaways or suicidal delinquents . Too often , the older generation is led to believe that " kids today are just no good " by publications such as yours . The article overflows with generalizations about the entire youth population , making us out to be a generation of losers . Except for a brief , gratuitous paragraph in the introduction , nowhere do you speak of the capable , well-balanced people that most teenagers are . Quite simply , the article was a stereotypical cliche . It provided no new or insightful views on today 's youth , but was merely a catchy , sensationalized , one-sided portrait of a few demented people who happened to be teen-agers . Miami . I am a 16-year-old who is wit , drinking and using nessing the lack of love among friends , Ielp of my parents . " moms and dads . Why ? Whereas families once associated themselves with others in companionship for happiness , we children are supposed to exchange thoughts with videogames , attend movies or attempt to atone for the loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a substitute . You who are parents do n't need to gamble for our loving attitudes . We are in need of your love . We 're human spirits , not material consumers to be won . Menlo Park , Calif . I have just finished reading your report on troubled teen-agers , and it has left me a bit troubled myself . I find myself in the generation that you have documented , and therefore I can relate to what you are trying to say . I am frustrated . Every day in my city , as in cities around the globe , I am faced with the teens of our era . Smoking cigarettes , and whatever they can get their hands on , snorting coke , taking other drugs , being sexually promiscuous , and all to show some form of rebellion against scholastic administration , parents , law enforcement , peers , and , in most cases , showers . To them , this behavior is cool , or the thing to do . Teens , although they continue to scream out for freedom from the forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wicked parents to begin to live as the adults they think they are , are no more ready for adulthood than a common 12-year-old . As a matter of fact , they are so far from this sort of " freedom " from authority that unless some drastic changes in each of their lives are made , they will never achieve the small unimportant goal they strike for . I know . I was there . I turned my life around , thanks to my parents . Heavily into the " cool , sophisticated " cocaine scene , I dug myself a deeper grave by tangling with federal authorities so I could continue my " cool , sophisticated " life ? too proud to tell my parents of my troubles . Finally , I had to turn to them or face a number of years in federal prison . To make a long story short , I am today happily employed , engaged to be married to a fantastic guy . I have quit smoking , drinking and using drugs , thanks to the help of my parents , whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am tired of hearing of the self-inflicted problems of the lazy teen-agers of our times ? the poor , misunderstood generation . I am sorry , editor , but I believe that your report was a little biased . I have no sympathy for those , young and old , who inflict drugs , cigarettes , pregnancy and death on themselves because they ca n't cope . It is just simply a total cop-out . Come on , get your heads out of the clouds and face simple reality ! ! !
