 | Bill , a Boston sales representative , and Diane , a Washington attorney , had been going together for two years . Bill wanted Diane to move to Boston to be a traditional career wife and mother . Diane wanted to keep her job and try a commuter marriage . He thought she was stubborn and uncaring . She saw him as inflexible . Both were also troubled by the number of their friends whose early marriages were ending in divorce . They decided to go to a couples counselor , who suggested they make a " good-faith effort " to visit each other 's city and " learn to like it . " They agreed to try . Will Bill and Diane find happiness , perhaps in Philadelphia ? Their story is a peculiarly modern parable illustrating that the course of true love may still lead to the altar , but with a stop , first , at the therapist 's office . Faced with a widening range of love and marriage options ? and the persistent specter of high divorce rates ? an increasing number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their unmarital conflicts . They may be bolder in love but they seem more cautious than ever about enlisting in a permanent relationship . The mere mention of " commitment , " for example , can spark a crisis , since it conjures up the even more ominous notion of marriage . " Generally , " observes Dr. Michael Kerr , director of training at the Georgetown University Family Center , " one of them is saying , Let 's do it , ' and the other is saying , I do n't know if I 'm ready for this . ' Often , that 's the issue that brings them in . " Often , in fact , couples therapy functions much like marriage counseling . One crucial difference , however , is that unmarried partners can usually make choices about ending the relationship with less emotional damage . " They are still free enough to get out of the relationship , " says Denver therapist Michael Solomon . When unmarried lovers talk of " clarifying " their romance , it can also be a signal that one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elaine , 35 , had a serious affair going for nearly three years , but she refused to consider getting married or living together . " It did n't even have to be marriage , " says Jack , a writer . " But we needed some kind of commitment . " Jack persuaded Elaine to enter therapy with him , hoping it would " get her to talk about things . " She did , and Jack heard some things he had n't heard before . " Like the fact that she wanted to see other guys . Or that she had a commitment to her work and never wanted to get married . " The couple saw the therapist four times , split the $90-a-session cost , and then simply split . " It helped us find out where we were , " Jack recalls . " She wanted to go back to Let 's not talk about it , let 's leave it alone . ' She was trying to get out and I finally saw it . " Going into therapy can in itself be an indication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relationship out of the realm of romance and fantasy into reality , " says SatKaur Khalsa , a Los Angeles family counse- lor who estimates that a quarter of her clientele consists of unmarried couples . " That transition can be devastating , " she adds , " and if a couple takes the time to begin that work before they get married , they bypass a lot of the shock . " Therapists agree that it is usually one of the partners , most often the woman , who initiates the move . The other partner sometimes comes in grudgingly , knowing he has been told , in effect , to put up or split up . For better or worse , a counselor can force the hidden issues of a relationship into the open . In the early going , he may serve as little more than a moderator while clients vent their hidden feelings . " Ninety percent of the time , " explains Dr. Jerome Fine , a New York City psychologist , " it 's the feelings that are more important than who 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an average three to nine months of counseling sessions , therapists can usually point out patterns of evasion , deception or resistance in a relationship . Some even use closed-circuit TV to help couples see the pattern for themselves . One therapist employing that technique successfully is Dr. Norman Paul . a Boston psychiatrist who describes himself as a family-systems specialist . The idea . he says , is that " the couple begins to have an overview about themselves . They view themselves in action and they can consider options for their behavior because they can see it played out . They do n't get so involved with what the other person is saying . " Counseling seems to attract couples of all ages . Some therapists say many of their clients are members of the baby-boom generation who postponed marriage and family and now , in their 20s and 30s , believer they have to make a decision . Others say the majority of couples include at least one partner , who is divorced and " gun shy " about the prospects of another misbegotten liaison . Obvious Solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimates that up to 70 percent of his unmarried couples , with particular stresses and strains of their own , are already living together . For one thing , notes Jay Haley , director of Washington 's Family Therapy Institute , " they ca n't rely on the traditional script " for solving their problems . Even though the practice is now widely accepted , living together may still be taboo in the eyes of their parents . " There 's not even a language for it , " says Haley . " Are you a lover ? Are you a roommate ? It can get pretty confusing . " Sometimes even the obvious solution requires the blessing of a therapist . Diane , 52 , and Ed , 51 , both veterans of previous marriages , had been living together for 14 years when they went into therapy last summer . Ed had been seeing the therapist on his own , but he decided to involve Diane . The problem , he says , was that while they had both made a commitment , they did n't quite know to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had been working through on a hit-or-miss basis . " Then one day last fall the therapist ? in what Diane remembers as " a throwaway line " ? remarked : " Why do n't you guys just get married ? " The pair looked at each other , and Diane recalls thinking : " Why , that 's an interesting idea . " Says Ed : " Once the unmentionable was mentioned , we kept talking about it . " And so , last April 21 , Ed and Diane were married .
