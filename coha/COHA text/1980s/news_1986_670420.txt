" You sure don ' t look like a race-car driver , " she said , " but you ' re certainly well-groomed. " // Telling that story , Bobby Rahal laughed and remembered how another driver , Sam Posey , once called him a " briefcase driver . " He also remembered how he has been described as " everything from a librarian to a banker and everything in between , and that ' s the good stuff . " But upon his arrival for the Chase Grand Prix at the Meadowlands here on Sunday , he looked exactly like what he is : the winner of the Indianapolis 500 , a phrase that is now part of his name. // " I ' ve always wondered , " he was saying now , " what ' s a race-car driver supposed to look like - Steve McQueen or James Garner . I guess some people see that 1930 ' s race-car movie with Mickey Rooney and think we ' ve got to have dirt under our fingernails. " // Along with most race-car drivers , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jet-fighter pilot . But at Newark Airport yesterday , he also had the look of a new father . He had Michaela , his 5 1/2-month-old daughter , in his arms and a baby bottle in the side pocket of his blue jacket. // " I ' m like butter when I ' m around Mikey , " he said . For all his sudden fame , Rahal has another look - that of someone whose understanding of life and death extends beyond the danger of the race-track wall . After years of frustration in trying to have children , he and his wife , Debi , adopted Michaela in January when she was two days old . But less than three weeks ago , his longtime race team owner , Jim Trueman , died at age 51 of colon cancer after having had his first Indianapolis 500 winner. // " The last time I saw Jim , I went to his house and sat on the bed next to him , " Rahal said . " The window was open and you could hear the birds chirping . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wondered if the sound of those birds chirping were etched in his memory. " // Surely the sound of their Indianapolis victory was etched in Trueman ' s memory . With two laps left , Rahal zipped past Kevin Cogan and stayed in front to win by 1. 4 seconds , with Rick Mears third by 1. 6 seconds . And as Rahal coasted through another lap in his red Budweiser/Truesports March-Cosworth , he was blinking with emotion . He knew his wife and his baby daughter were waiting in Victory Lane along with his terminally ill sponsor. // " On that cool-off lap , " he said , " so many things were coming at you , you don ' t know what to think - except you know you should be happy. " // Throughout his illness , Trueman had never talked about his cancer , never sought sympathy . But that was typical of his manner. // " He was a different man , especially in the world of motor racing , " Rahal said . " In motor racing , you have so many liars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didn ' t squander words . He wouldn ' t sit in a bar and tell you what he ' s done or what he ' s going to do . But when he did say something , you knew he was going to make something happen . " Rahal remembered how Trueman , a former road racer himself , once handed him $500 so he could race at Watkins Glen. // " When you don ' t have $500 , that ' s a lot of money , " Rahal said . " And he ' d buy a year ' s worth of tires for amateur drivers , that ' s $2 , 000 or $3 , 000 , to let you drive with different tires in every race instead of using the same tires for two or three races . There ' s nobody in racing who gave people what Jim did. " // But then Rahal returned all those favors by giving the founder of the Red Roof motel chain his first 500 victory. // " We ' re talking Hollywood here , movie time , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory , it ' s spooky. " // His daughter won ' t remember seeing that victory , but she was there , just as she had been at three previous races. // " From the time we got married , Debi always wanted kids , " Rahal was saying now . " I would say , ' Yeah , O.K. , fine , some day . ' I don ' t know if I was scared or what ; it ' s not like you could trade it in if you don ' t like it . When you have a child , it ' s yours . But finally I decided that maybe it was time. " // Four years ago Debi was pregnant with twins . But she miscarried , losing one at 3 months , the other at 4 1/2 months . Infection and a disease of the reproductive organs prevented her from having children . After a while , some drivers ' wives wouldn ' t even tell Debi they were pregnant. // " We decided to adopt , " he recalled . " Three or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the last moment . " But then Michaela arrived at their Dublin , Ohio , home . The Rahals didn ' t know if their child would be a boy or a girl. // " I ' m glad it ' s a girl , " her father said with a smile . " If it had been a boy , I would ' ve had to answer all those questions about whether I ' d be willing to let him be a race-car driver , but this way I don ' t have to . It ' s so neat to see her grow up , I ' ve wondered what I was doing not having any kids for the last 10 years. " // For the last 10 years , of course , Rahal has been developing into one of auto racing ' s best drivers. // " For a driver , " he said , " winning at Indianapolis has the same effect as winning the Kentucky Derby has for a jockey , or winning the Masters has for a golfer . The difference is that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or major tournaments . But in auto racing , there ' s only one major - the Indianapolis 500. " // Even so , the Grand Prix at the Meadowlands and several other races are harder on a driver. // " All the braking and shifting make the Meadowlands race harder physically , " he said . " At Indianapolis , the length of the straightaways gives you time to take a breather. " // But as the Indianapolis 500 winner , Bobby Rahal has hardly had time for a breather. // " I ' ll be visiting some ad agencies in New York next week , " he said . " Winning the Indianapolis 500 gives you instant credibility , whether you deserve it or not. " // And no matter what you look like. //
