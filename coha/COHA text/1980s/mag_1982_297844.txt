AS YOU LIKE IT by William Shakespeare <P> On March 8 , 1978 , an arsonist set fire to San Diego 's Old Globe Theater , and within minutes the interior was completely gutted . Though no one could see it at the time , this act of pure malice was also a kind of favor : it roused the spirits of all those in San Diego who love a play , prompting them to build a new , far better theater . When the new Old Globe opened last month , they could see just how well their $6.5 million had been spent . Both the theater and the company please the eye and delight the mind . <P> Set in the middle of 1,400-acre Balboa Park , the mock-Elizabethan building looks from the outside somewhat the way Shakespeare 's own Globe was supposed to look , with leaded windows , half-timbering and a second floor jutting out over the first .

Ellis Rabb , who also has a long association with the theater , is best as Jaques , that amusing figure who cherishes sadness and brags that he " can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs . " Almost no one else is less than capable . But perhaps the real star of the evening is Designer Hay , who stayed on after completing the interior of the theater to create a beautiful and beguiling Forest of Arden for the premiere production . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sophisticated community playhouse in the Old Globe and in the 245-seat Cassius Carter Center Stage next door . That catastrophe forced it to rethink its commitment to theater and spurred it to establish a professional , Equity-scale company . Now , with the new Globe , the Carter and a new 620-seat outdoor stage , it has one of the best complexes in the U.S. Artistic Director Jack O'Brien has ambitious plans to make San Diego an important theatrical center , a rival of the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles and the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco . That will take both time and effort , but O'Brien and his company have made a more than promising begining <P> - By Gerald Clarke
