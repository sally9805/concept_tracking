Today ' s action was an adroit compromise aimed at curbing an unusual public dispute among the bishops . It arose because brief passages in the AIDS document , issued with the unanimous approval of the bishops ' 50-member administrative board last December , suggested that information about condoms might be included in education aimed at preventing AIDS. // John Cardinal O ' Connor of New York and other Catholic leaders objected that the document left the impression that the church had changed its official rejection of artificial birth control . <> <> Vatican Offers Advice // Other bishops have argued that the statement clearly stresses the church ' s opposition to contraception and criticizes a resort to condoms , but that it recognizes their value in preventing AIDS among people who do not follow Catholic teaching on sexual morality. // The argument was also joined , to a degree , by the Vatican , which urged the American bishops to avoid actions that could " even give the impression " of condoning practices the church considers immoral. // The decision today , characterized by two officials as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached in a private meeting of the nation ' s bishops , who are here for their annual summer conference . The architect of the compromise was Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago , who said the original document , " The Many Faces of AIDS : A Gospel Response , " was meant only to provide the bishops with a common approach to practical problems , not serve as a comprehensive statement on sexual morality . <> <> Statements Not Binding // The administrative board of the bishops ' conference makes policy between the twice-yearly gatherings of all the bishops , but its statements are not binding . The documents are usually written because a number of bishops have expressed a desire for some common approach or guidance , and the AIDS issue was deemed too pressing to wait for the full conference. // Cardinal Bernardin argued that to retract or repudiate the statement " would be imprudent - indeed , in my judgment , disastrous , " and " could give the impression that the entire document is flawed . " At the same time , however , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He proposed the composition of a further document that would not put the earlier one " in a state of limbo " but use it " as the stepping-off point " for a statement that would be debated by the full body of bishops. // Cardinal Bernardin ' s proposal was seconded by Bernard Cardinal Law of Boston , a key critic of the document , and was unanimously approved by the bishops. // Asked afterward whether today ' s action really showed a consensus on the theological points at issue , Cardinal Bernardin said that the consensus was about the future , about what kind of process was needed to maintain unity. // While the debate today took place in a closed session , the bishops had been presented with written arguments for and against " The Many Faces of AIDS " by a dozen bishops , as well as a letter conveying the views of Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger , who heads the Vatican ' s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , a body charged with overseeing theological orthodoxy. // Cardinal Ratzinger ' s letter appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without consulting Rome and warned against the appearance of condoning immoral practices. // " The Many Faces of AIDS , " a 7 , 700-word policy paper , dealt broadly with the responsibility of government and church to respond compassionately to those affected by the AIDS epidemic . It explicitly reaffirmed Catholic teaching that sexual activity should be confined to marriage , and it criticized condoms as unsatisfactory , practically or morally , as a safeguard against AIDS . At the same time , however , the bishops said they would not oppose dissemination of information in public AIDS-prevention programs if these programs dealt with human sexuality in a moral framework . <> <> Law Called for Withdrawal // The document also called for AIDS programs in Catholic schools , and there was confusion over whether its tolerance of information about condoms extended to Catholic education. // Cardinal Law of Boston quickly demanded that the document be withdrawn , and the issue was complicated by an indication from Cardinal O ' Connor ' s office that the document had indeed been put in abeyance. // This brought a denial from Archbishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Conference of Catholic Bishops , and a strong defense of the statement from Cardinal Bernardin , who said it was " faithful to the Catholic doctrinal and moral tradition. " // On May 9 , in his recent trip in Latin America , Pope John Paul II had refused to prescribe a specific course of action for the American bishops on the AIDS dispute . He told reporters that the bishops should " reflect " on their document and apply the church ' s universal teaching to their situation . " I am not a dictator , " he had said . " I am the successor of Peter. " // The Pope ' s remarks were cited by several church officials here . <> <> Issue of Sin and Guilt // Cardinal O ' Connor , who was among the dozen bishops providing a written commentary for today ' s session , cited his experiences with the Presidential AIDS commission and with AIDS patients themselves in saying , " I do not say what follows on the basis of superficial association with the AIDS epidemic. " // He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ references to condoms were inadequate morally and , according to " a variety of scientific and medical advsiers , " pragmatically. // In addition to the medical issue of condoms ' effectiveness in preventing AIDS , he said , " psychologists and psychiatrists I have consulted tell me they are particularly concerned that there is little emphasis on sin or guilt . " According to the Cardinal , " They believe it essential to help persons with AIDS accept and work through their guilt. " // Cardinal O ' Connor argued for rewriting " The Many Faces of AIDS , " as did Cardinal Law in his written commentary. // Bishop Anthony M. Pilla of Cleveland , on the other hand , defended the document as " pastorally effective. " // " Our statements must stand a test of realism in terms of our being credible in the pluralistic atmosphere , " he wrote . " Realism means that we address the issues in a way that reflects our ability to grasp what is actually going on among people. " // Bishop Pilla added , " Strategy in teaching can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain firm and clear. " // " Only a selective rendition of the text , " he said , " would permit a reading that suggests we are recommending , or advocating , or even permitting the use of condoms . " <> <> ' Pluralistic Society ' Cited // Bishop Stanley J. Ott of Baton Rouge said the dispute turned on " an inevitable problem in a pluralistic society. " // " That problem , " he said , " is how does a religious body like the Catholic Church , with a declared stance against artificial contraception , cooperate with other religious and civic groups who not share our moral viewpoint on contraception " when the use of condoms is a potential means " of preventing the spread of the disease. " // Bishop Ott acknowledged that some bishops might have felt that the document was not clear in outlining a policy of cooperating with such groups without agreeing with them , and that those bishops " had the right to clarify " Catholic teaching in statements to the press . " They should not , however , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added. // It will be Archbishop May ' s responsibility to choose a committee to work on the new statement about AIDS . " We will get to work right away , " he promised , but he doubted that a draft could be ready for discussion at the next full meeting of the bishops , in November. //
