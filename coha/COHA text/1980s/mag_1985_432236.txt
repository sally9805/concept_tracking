 | Los Angeles , that kingdom of movies and malls , has struggled for years to find its own center , in both a geographical and a cultural sense . True , there is the 21-year-old Music Center , with its Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for music and two resplendent theaters , the Ahmanson and the Mark Taper Forum . But the complex , which stands at the edge of a sprawl of once grand buildings ( including theaters ) that just cry out for restoration , never attracted further artistic growth nearby . Now , however , a scrappy street fighter named Bill Bushnell has opened his Los Angeles Theatre Center smack in the middle of that downtown area , inaugurating a glowing new stage in the city 's cultural life . Spread through several levels of a handsomely restored former bank building , Bushnell 's new four-auditorium performance center highlights the current explosive growth of theatrical activity in the entire region , from San Diego north to Santa Barbara . " There is n't a day that my phone does n't ring off the hook , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from out of town , and always with the same story : there 's no theater in New York anymore , can I come out ? " Quality may vary , but there 's no denying that southern California does have theater nowadays , and in stupefying abundance . Currently there are over 100 offerings to choose from , without even counting the usual dinner-theater shows . The variety is astonishing . Some shows , of course , are standard stuff ; Hal Holbrook and his " Mark Twain Tonight ! " came through last month , and still another roadshow version of " A Chorus Line " is on the way . Almost everybody 's favorite TV stars are bound to show up in some flossy , liveaction sitcom ? John Ritter ( " Three 's a Crowd " ) is starring in an agreeable trifle called " The Unvarnished Truth , " now playing at the Ahmanson . That much could pass for a theater scene in any fairsize American city . But there 's more , much more , in southern California . Much of it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go- ing on longer than Eastcoast cynics are willing to admit . The Mark Taper 's Gordon Davidson has been a creative force in Los Angeles for almost two decades . At San Diego 's Old Globe Theatre , currently flourishing under the artistic direction of New York expatriate Jack O'Brien , first-rate Shakespeare has been a staple since the 1930s , including , last month , a searing " Richard III " staged by John Houseman with Paxton Whitehead as the tortured and torturing monarch . The South Coast Repertory , now in its 21st season , presents such challenging plays as Bertolt Brecht 's epic " Galileo " in its two-stage playhouse at the edge of a vast shopping mall in suburban Costa Mesa . There is lively summertime fare at Des McAnuff 's La Jolla Playhouse , where Roger Miller 's Tony award-winning " Big River " was groomed for Broadway a year ago , and where Stephen Sondheim 's muchlamented 1981 flop , " Merrily We Roll Along , " was beautifully reworked last summer for a second chance in New York . There are no finite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on- , off- or off-off-Broadway . Performing spaces tucked into old warehouses or renovated supermarkets thrive almost anywhere there are parking spaces nearby . The overall impression is of a bustling theatrical megalopolis where virtually anything can and will be tried in the name of theater . Some of it defies description . What can you say , for example , about the East West Players , an ensemble composed of AsianAmericans who occasionally come up with first-rate , if cut-down , productions of Kurt Weill and Sondheim musicals ? How to explain the five-year , near-capacity run in a West L.A. hole-in-the-wall of " Bleacher Bums , " some footloose nonsense about some Chicago Cubs baseball fans ? Demonic Energy : Underlying the bustling theatrical life is what Bushnell describes as " a revolution against a dying Eastern establishment that clings to the false assumption that there is an American theater capital and its name is New York . " Detroit-born Bushnell , 48 , has been part of this regional ferment since 1975 , when he joined TV actor Ralph Waite 's newly founded Los Angeles Actors ' Theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood firetrap , LAAT drew near-capacity crowds for its high-level productions of new and almost-new plays . A theatrical impresario of demonic energy , Bushnell launched his campaign for a major theatrical facility in 1982 . He smart-talked the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency into a dollar-a-year rental for the bank building on Spring  | Street , recently designated a landmark , then launched a major restoration campaign with tub-thumping help from Mayor Tom Bradley . Three years and $16 million later , much of it from private donors , Bushnell has his center . It contains four steeply raked theaters that range in seating capacity from 99 to 503 , a handsome blockwide lobby with a striking stained-glass ceiling and sweeping new staircases that lead the eye toward the theater entrances . Moreover , thanks to a whirlwind telephone campaign , Bushnell has some 26,000 subscribers to power his sails through the first season . Love Object : And he has his plays . The opening bill was shrewdly designed to suggest the breadth of the center 's potential , from the dependable classic ( Chekhov 's " Three Sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the message that old plays can be fun ) to the moderately wicked avant-garde ( Greg Mehrten 's " It 's a Man 's World , " the sorrows of an actor not quite manly , in a multimedia production by Manhattan 's inventive Mabou Mines ) . There was , as well , a dizzying allblack production of Sam Shepard 's " Fool for Love , " set ablaze by the nonstop incandescence of Pam Grier as the love object beset by fools , and William Mastrosimone 's " Nanawatai , " a terrifically theatrical if rather simplistic piece wherein Afghan freedom fighters , their own ranks riven by internecine rivalries , join forces long enough to track and capture a Soviet tank right there onstage . So what if " Nanawatai 's " tank outdrew the live actors on the applause meters ? It 's more to the point that Bushnell 's theater center , despite its location in a part of town the tourists prefer not to see , drew capacity crowds for all four productions . Bushnell , who defines himself as " an eternal optimist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America 's theatrical future . " It 's just now beginning to come into focus , " he says .
