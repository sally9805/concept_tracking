<P> The Israeli Cabinet 's overwhelming acceptance of the report of the commission inquiring into the Beirut massacre will prove important to Israel 's wellbeing , but the power of the report goes beyond Israel . Whether or not they meant to , the commissioners produced a philosophical document , an expression of moral thought . What the report says , quietly , within its recommendations and explanations , is that there is a truth in human actions both detectable and accountable without confessions or irrefutable evidence-a secret truth-and that in the eyes of both common justice and common sense , this truth has no place to hide . <P> This idea comes to light in the report 's basic principle of " indirect responsibility , " an old principle , needing little clarification . What the Israeli commission called indirect responsibility , Thomas Aquinas deemed the sin of omission , and the concept antedates Aquinas in the Old Testament prophets . In domestic law it goes by the name of negligence . The application is familiar : by doing nothing to prevent a wrongful act , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares a portion of the blame . It may go further . If one sets into motion a train of events that lead to a calamity , however circuitously , he may be culpable as well , the absence of intention being merely a detail . <P> One of the side virtues of the commission 's work is that it elevates the principle of indirect responsibility to international cognizance . The jurists at the Nuremberg trials went to great lengths to cite positive acts , " crimes against humanity . " No one was charged with just standing by . The difference in the Israeli report ( apart from its not being a court verdict ) is that at Nuremberg a victor was judging a fallen enemy , whereas here the accused were called to account by their own people . <P> But the fundamental force of the report rests not in its application of indirect responsibility , nor in the explosive political context in which it struck a match . Rather its value is that it makes use of a kind of truth that is ordinarily the preserve of psychologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this truth equal weight and status with objectively provable reality . The commissioners record that witnesses characterized the massacre as " a disaster which no one had imagined and which could not have been-or , at all events , need not have been-foreseen . " They then make this extraordinary announcement : " We are not prepared to attach any importance to these statements . " When one says something like that , he can mean only two things . First , I do not believe your account of the circumstances . Second , I know , or strongly suspect , what really occurred . <P> To make such a claim takes nerve , to say the least . To Sharon and the others the report plainly says : You are indirectly responsible for Sabra and Shatila because you " should have felt apprehension , " you should have " taken the danger into account " ; you " were obligated to foresee as probable " the carnage that ensued .
