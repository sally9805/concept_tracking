txt  | the sense of being antonyms . The examples in ( 9 ) are antonyms essentially because there is a scale containing the " opposites " at either end , with a midpoint ( or midinterval ) between them : Thus , the words hot and cold can be said to be antonyms ( " opposites " ) since they define the extremities of a scale ( of temperature , in this case ) that has a midinterval between them ( in this case , represented by the word lukewarm , a word that can be used to refer to things that are neither hot nor cold ) . ( See Lehrer and Lehrer 1982 . ) Finally , groups of words in the lexicon can be semantically related by being members of a set known as a semantic field ( see Lehrer 1974 ) . On a very general and intuitive level , we can say that the words in a semantic field , though not synonymous , are all used to talk about the same general phenomenon . Classical examples of semantic fields include color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kinship terms ( mother , father , sister , brother ) , and cooking terms ( boil , fry , bake , broil , steam ) . The notion of a semantic field can be extended intuitively to any set of terms with a close relation in meaning , all of which can be subsumed under the same general label . Thus , in addition to the specific semantic fields cited , we could also refer to labels such as " nautical terms , " " plant names , " " animal names , " " automobile terms , " and so on , as specifying semantic fields . The kinds of semantic fields found in the lexicon of any given language ( that is , the kinds of general labels that define the particular semantic fields ) may vary from culture to culture , and in fact anthropologists have found the study of semantic fields useful in investigating the nature of belief systems and reasoning in different cultural groups . At this point we have completed our initial survey of semantic properties and relations in the area of word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of word meaning reveals that the lexicon of a language is not simply a random list of words . Semantic relations such as synonymy , antonymy , and the relation defined by semantic fields all serve to link certain words with other words , indicating that the overall lexicon of a language has a complex internal structure consisting of subgroups , or " networks , " of words sharing significant properties .  | Sentences Since sentences are composed of words and phrases , we can expect that certain semantic properties and relations of words and phrases will carry over to sentences as well . However , as traditional grammarians put it , a sentence ( as opposed to a single word or phrase ) expresses a " complete thought . " This is not a very useful definition of a sentence , but it does suggest that sentences have a unique function , and thus we might expect to find semantic properties and relations that are unique to sentences . Meaning Properties and Relations Among the meaning properties and relations of words and phrases that carry over to sentences are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She visited a little girl 's school . b . Synonymy A man , in a car , just pulled up . A man in an automobile just pulled up . However , sentences also exhibit meaning properties and relations that words and phrases lack . One important property of a sentence is its communicative potential . Sentences with different structures often have different communicative functions ( see chapter 9 ) . Thus , if a speaker wants to assert or state that something is true , then the normal type of sentence to utter is a declarative sentence such as Snow is white . On the other hand , if the speaker wants to issue an order , request , or command , then an imperative sentence such as Leave the room ! is in order . Finally , if a speaker wants to ask a question , then the obvious choice is an interrogative sentence such as What time is it ? As a first approximation we could diagram these facts as follows : ( II ) a . Declarative sentence -* Used to assert , state , declare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order , request , command , etc. c . Interrogative sentence -* Used to ask questions , etc . It seems to be a part of the semantics of these structural types ( declarative , imperative , interrogative ) that they have the distinct communicative functions cited above . In any event , no one could be said to  | understand sentences of these types if they did not understand the differences in communicative function . That some types of sentences are used literally to assert that something is true is an important semantic fact . That an imperative sentence is normally used to request a hearer to do something ( to comply with the request ) and that an interrogative sentence is used literally to ask a question are also important semantic facts . However , the field of semantics has traditionally concentrated on the assertive function of language , concerning itself mainly with the properties and relations that sentences have regarding truth . Truth Properties Not only do expressions in a language have meaning , and often reference , they are also used to say things that are true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predict which sentences are used to say something true and which are used to say something false , in part because truth and falsity depend upon what is being referred to , and because the same words can be used in identical sentences to refer to different things . For instance , if two speakers utter the sentence I took your picture last night , then what one of them says may be true , while what the other says may be false . Furthermore , if the sentence is ambiguous , it may be used to say something true when taken one way but false when taken another way : ( 12 ) a . I removed your painting last night . b . I photographed you last night . Does this mean that the semantics of natural language can not deal with truth and falsity ? The answer is no , because some truth properties and truth relations hold regardless of reference , provided meaning is held constant . Consider first the property of being linguistically true ( also called analytically true ) or linguistically false ( also called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linguistically false ) if its truth ( or falsehood ) is determined solely by the semantics of the language and it is not necessary to check any facts about the nonlinguistic world in order to determine its truth or falsehood . A sentence is empirically true ( or empirically false ) if it is not linguistically true or false ? that is , if it is necessary to check the world in order to verify or falsify it . Most of the claims of common sense and science are of this latter sort . If some- one says that the glottis was discovered last year , this claim is true ( or false ) just in case the glottis was , as a matter of fact , discovered ( or not discovered ) last year ; knowledge of the language alone does not settle the matter . Semantics is not concerned with empirical truths and falsehoods but with those sentences that are linguistically true or false . In each of the groups ( 13 ) , ( 14 ) , and ( 15 ) it is possible to determine truth values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to the actual state of the world . ( 13 ) a . Either it is raining here or it is not raining here . ( T ) b . If John is sick and Mary is sick , then John is sick . ( T ) c . It is raining here and it is not raining here . ( F ) d . If John is sick and Mary is sick , then John is not sick . ( F ) ( 14 ) a . All people that are sick are people . ( T ) b . If every person is sick , then it is not true that no person is sick . ( T ) c . Some people that are sick are not people . ( F ) d . Every person is sick , but some person is not ( sick ) . ( F ) ( 15 ) a . If John is a bachelor , then John is unmarried . ( T ) b . If John killed the bear , then the bear died . ( T ) c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a color . ( T ) d . John is a bachelor , but he is married . ( F ) e . John killed the bear and it 's ( still ) alive . ( F ) f . The car is red , but it has no color . ( F ) Again , knowing the language seems to be sufficient for knowing the truth or falsity of these sentences , and this being so , the semantics of these sorts of sentences will be relevant to a semantic theory . Truth Relations We have noted that there are truth relations as well as truth properties that fall within the scope of semantics . The most central truth relation for semantics is entailment . One sentence S is said to entail another sentence S ' when the truth of the first guarantees the truth of the second and the falsity of the second guarantees the falsity of the first , as in 116 ) :  | ( 16 ) a . The car is red entails The car has a color . b . The needle is too short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that the first sentence in each example , if true , guarantees the truth of the second ; and the falsity of the second sentence in each example guarantees the falsity of the first . Closely related to entailment is another truth relation , semantic presupposition . The basic idea behind semantic presupposition is that the falsity of the presupposed sentence causes the presupposing sentence not to have a truth value ( T or F ) . Furthermore , both a sentence and its denial have the same semantic presupposition . Although this truth relation is somewhat controversial , ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) show typical examples of semantic presupposition in which both the positive ( a ) and the negative ( b ) sentences have the same presupposition ( c ) : ( 17 ) a . The present King of France is bald . b . The present King of France is not bald . c . There is a present King of France . ( 18 ) a . John realizes that his car has been stolen . b . John does not realize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car has been stolen . In sum , there are at least two truth relations that an adequate semantic theory must explain , or explain away , entailment and semantic presupposition , and these must be added to the truth properties already discussed . Logical Form and Analytic Sentences ( technical section ) There are some important differences between examples ( 13 ) , ( 14 ) , and ( 15 ) . In ( 13 ) the truth value ( T or F ) is determined solely by the connectives or , and , if . . . then , and the word not ( which sometimes abbreviates it is not the case that ) . Since these sorts of words are often dubbed logical words , these sentences are also called logical truths ( of English ) . It can be seen that the form of these sentences makes them true regardless of how the world is . For instance , the logical form of ( 13a ) and ( 13b ) in terms of logical words is :  | ( 19 ) a . Either S or not-S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , then S. ( T ) No matter what ( grammatical ) declarative sentences we may pick for S and S ' , the resulting compound sentence will be true . The same holds for the falsity of ( 13c ) and ( 13d ) , which also is attributable to their logical form : ( 20 ) a . S and not-S . ( F ) b . If S and S ' , then not-S . ( F ) The same remarks hold for ( 14 ) , except that the relevant logical words are some , every , and no . The first two of these sentences are true in virtue of their logical form ; the last two are false in virtue of their logical form : ( 21 ) a . All X ' s that are P are X ' s . ( T ) b . If every X is P , then it is not true that no X is P. ( T ) c . Some X 's that are P are not X 's . ( F ) d . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. ( F ) This procedure of deriving the logical form of a sentence yields very different results when applied to the sentences in ( 15 ) . This is because the words relevant to the linguistic truth or falsehood of these sentences are not logical words , which can be used in discussing any subject matter , but descriptive words such as bachelor , kill , and red used in discussing certain kinds of subject matter ? bachelors , killings , colors , and so on . If we follow the procedure of replacing descriptive words with letters in ( 15a ? c ) , thereby converting them into their logical forms , the result is ( 22a ? c ) : ( 22 ) a . If John is a B , then John is U. b . If John K-ed the bear , then the bear D-ed. c . If the car is R , then the car has a C. It is easy to see that such forms as those in ( 22 ) need not always result in sentences that are true , as was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms can yield sentences that are false :  | ( 23 ) a . If John is a bachelor , then John is unhappy . ( F ) b . If John kicked the bear , then the bear died . ( F ) c . If the car is repossessed , then the car has a carburetor . ( F ) Even if such sentences as ( 23a ? c ) are not true by virtue of their logical form , sometimes they can be converted into logical truths by substituting into them definitions for these descriptive words . For instance , suppose that the following definition is correct : ( Def. 1 ) bachelor = Def. " unmarried and adult and male " If we replace the word bachelor in ( 15a ) with the right-hand side of Def. 1 , the result is sentence ( 24 ) : ( 24 ) If John is unmarried and adult and male , then John is unmarried . What is interesting about ( 24 ) is that it has the form of a logical truth , namely , ( 25 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and M , then John is U. Thus , certain sentences that are not logical truths can be converted into logical truths by replacing the crucial descriptive words with their definitions . Sentences that can be converted into logical truths by this sort of substitution are often called analytic sentences , and since they are true by virtue of their semantic structure , they are considered to fall within the scope of a semantic theory . In sum , there are a variety of truth properties that a semantic theory should account for , including those of linguistic truth and linguistic falsehood and , among these , logical and even analytical truth ( or falsehood ) . Goals of a Semantic Theory We now come to the question of the goals of a semantic theory . What should a semantic theory do , and how ? The short answer to the first question is that a semantic theory should attribute to each expression E in the language the semantic properties and relations that it has ; moreover , it should define those properties  | and relations . Thus , if an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . If E has a specific set of meanings , the semantic theory should specify them . If E is ambiguous , the semantic theory should record that fact . And so on . Moreover , if two expressions are synonymous , or if one entails the other , the semantic theory should mark these semantic relations . We can organize these demands on a semantic theory by saying that an adequate semantic theory of a language must generate every true instance of the following schemes : ( 26 ) a . Meaning Properties and Relations E is literally used to E means E is meaningful . E is ambiguous . E is anomalous ( nonsense ) . E is redundant . E and E ' are synonymous . E includes the meaning of E ' . E and E ' overlap in meaning . E and E ' are antonymous. b . Denotational Properties and Relations E is a singular denoting expression . E is a general denoting expression . E and E ' are codenotational ( coextensive ) . c . Truth Properties and Relations E is logically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E is contradictory . E entails E ' . E semantically presupposes E ' . We can say in sum that the domain of a semantic theory is at least the set of properties and relations listed in ( 26 ) ; we should not be satisfied with a semantic theory of English that fails to explain them ( or to explain them away ) . The second question concerning the goals of a semantic theory is , How should the theory handle these semantic properties and relations ? What kinds of constraints on a semantic theory are reasonable to impose ? We will mention , just two . First , it is generally conceded that even though a natural language contains an infinite number of phrases  | and sentences ( recall chapter 5 ) , a semantic theory of a natural language should be finite : people are capable of storing only a finite amount of information , but they nevertheless learn the semantics of natural languages . The second constraint on a semantic theory of a natural language is that it should reflect the fact that , except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the meaning of a syntactically complex expression is determined by the meaning of its constituents and their grammatical relations . Compositionality rests on the fact that a finite number of familiar words and expressions can be combined and recombined to form an infinite number of novel phrases and sentences ; hence , a finite semantic theory that reflects compositionality can describe meanings for an infinite number of complex expressions . The existence of compositionality is most dramatic when compositional expressions are contrasted with expressions that lack compositionality . In ( 27a ) the expression kick the bucket has two meanings : ( 27 ) a . John kicked the bucket . b . John kicked the wooden pail. c . John died . One of the meanings of ( 27a ) is compositional : it is determined on the basis of the meaning of its constituent words and is synonymous with ( 27b ) . The other meaning of ( 27a ) is idiomatic and can be paraphrased as ( 27c ) . Idiomatic meanings are not compositional in the sense of being determined from the meaning of the constituent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idiomatic meaning of ( 27a ) by knowing just the meaning of the words and recognizing familiar grammatical structure ? an idiomatic meaning must be learned separately as a unit . Idioms behave as though they were syntactically complex words whose meaning can not be predicted , since their syntactic structure is doing no semantic work . It would be a mistake to think of the compositionality of a complex expression as simply adding up the meanings and references of its parts . For adjective + noun constructions like that in ( 28a ) , adding up sometimes works : ( 28 ) a . He was a bearded Russian soldier . b . He was Russian and bearded and a soldier .  | But even in such constructions the contribution of syntax can be devious , as in ( 29 ) , where we can not simply add up the meanings of occasional and sailor : ( 29 ) a . An occasional sailor walked by . b. *Someone who is a sailor and occasional walked by . Modifiers can create other complications for compositionality , which must also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Contrast the arguments in ( 30 ) and ( 31 ) : ( 30 ) a . That is a gray elephant . ( T ) b . All elephants are animals . ( T ) c . So , that is a gray animal . ( T ) ( 31 ) a . That is a small elephant . ( T ) b . All elephants are animals . ( T ) c . So , that is a small animal . ( F ) In ( 30 ) the premises ( a ) and ( b ) jointly entail the truth of ( c ) , but in ( 31 ) the premises ( a ) and ( b ) do not jointly entail ( 31c ) . The only difference between ( 30 ) and ( 31 ) is the occurrence of gray in ( 30 ) and small in ( 31 ) , so clearly there is some difference in the semantics of these two words . More complicated and interesting examples of the interaction of semantics and syntax come from the functional relations of subject and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and ( 32c ) the words are the same , but the entailments ( 32b ) and ( 32d ) are importantly different . ( 32 ) a . John killed the snake . b . The snake died . c . The snake killed John . d . John died . This further illustrates the degree to which a semantic theory must be integrated with a syntactic theory in an adequate description of a natural language .  | A SAMPLE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS The goal of a semantic theory is to correctly describe the semantic properties and relations of every expression in the language . The theory must also define what these semantic properties and relations are . Furthermore , since the scope of a semantic theory will be infinite ( there being an unlimited number of phrases and sentences in the language ) , the theory itself will have to make use of the structure and categories in the language . That is to say , just as a grammar attempts to state a finite number of principles that reveal structure at various levels ( phonological , morphological , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a finite number of principles that will account for the unlimited number of possible phrases and sentences . A semantic theory with this property is said to be " compositional . " We turn now to the problem of outlining a semantic theory . It is traditional to do this in two stages : first , to represent the semantics of words and idioms ; second , to represent the semantics of phrases and sentences . The reason for this division is that syntactic relations such as subject and object are used in the second stage of representation but not in the first . Words and Idioms Semantic Representation and Decomposition Most semantic theories have one component that represents the semantics of the syntactically unstructured expressions of the language , the words , as well as the semantics of those expressions whose internal syntactic structure is semantically irrelevant , the idioms . It also describes the semantic relations between words and idioms . This component is variously called the dictionary or the lexicon . We will first look at the sorts of information that are represented at this level . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lexical entry for a word or idiom . Beginning with the syntactic information associated with words , note that we need to represent the part of speech of each expression . For instance , the word run can be either a verb or a noun : ( 33 ) a . Run on now , I run this place . ( verbs ) b . He scored nine runs in one inning and got a run in his sock . ( nouns )  | Since a semantic theory must represent the meaning of each ( meaningful ) expression and represent nonsynonymous expressions as different in meaning , a lexical entry will have to associate the verb run with its verbal meanings and the noun run with its nominal meanings . Each occurrence of run in ( 33 ) means something different , and the syntactic categories noun and verb distinguish the first two from the last two . Thus , the first piece of information needed to describe the semantics of a word is its syntactic category . The situation is similar for idioms , some of which correspond to intransitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 34b ) , and some to noun phrases ( 34c ) : ( 34 ) a . NP kicks the bucket : NP dies b . NP reads the riot act to NP : NP bawls out NP c . That stick-in-the-mud : that old fogy Though the syntactic category is necessary for correctly representing the semantics of an expression , it is not sufficient ; many nonsynonymous expressions have the same syntactic categorization , as we saw in the case of run . To account for the full range of semantic properties and relations set out in section 6.3 , lexical entries for words and idioms will have to represent enough semantic information to predict these properties and relations at the lexical level . How can this be accomplished ? First , by the representation of meaning ( and occasionally reference ) of words and idioms ; and second , by the representation of various semantic relations between words and idioms . The problem of how to represent the semantics of words and idioms is complicated by our inability to say exactly what meaning is , but the representation problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mathematics we are able to describe various properties and relations between numbers , as in ( 35 ) : ( 35 ) a . The number 2 is an even prime . h . For any number there is a larger number . Yet we have no generally accepted theory of what numbers are . Similarly , it can he argued that in semantics one can represent meaning and reference without committing oneself to stating exactly what meaning and reference are . In order to do this , though , semantics must be fairly abstract and formal . We will not attempt a detailed discussion of  | semantic representation here . In spite of this , we believe that our informal presentation will provide some insight into the nature of semantic representation . Consider typical descriptive words and idioms such as boy , girl , father , mother , kill , and kick the bucket . It has seemed clear to many theorists that such words are not the most basic semantic units but are actually semantically complex items , composed or made up of more primitive semantic components . Semantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are called decompositional ( or sometimes componential ) semantic theories . In effect , a decompositional theory of word meaning extends compositionality to the level of the internal structure of lexical items . Let us consider , as an example of lexical decomposition , the following definition : ( Def. 2 ) boy = Def . HUMAN(X) AND MALE(X) AND NOT-ADULT(X) The basic idea in such a representation is that the symbols in capital letters represent the semantic components in the meaning of the word and the variable X stands for whoever is being spoken of . According to Def. 2 , saying ( 36a ) amounts to saying ( 36b ) : ( 36 ) a . That 's a boy . b . That 's a human male who is nonadult . A lexical entry for girl would look like Def. 2 except for having FEMALE(X) instead of MALE(X) . The word father , unlike boy , is a relational noun . To be a father is to be a male parent of someone ? it is to bear a special relation to another person , the relation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing for the objects that are related . For instance , father is understood as " X is the father of Y , " where X represents the father , Y the child . We can represent father at this level as in Def. 3 : ( Def. 3 ) father = Def . MALE(X) AND X PARENT OF Y Clearly , mother is like Def. 3 but with FEMALE(X) instead of MALE(X) . Transitive verbs are like relational nouns in requiring variables to indicate the various roles of the participants . Thus , kill is understood as  | " X kill Y. " This is indicated by the fact that if there was a killing , then someone or something did the killing , and someone or something was killed ; that is , if X killed Y , then Y died , and X caused this . We can represent this as in Def. 4 , letting XS indicate the subject and Xo the direct object : ( Def. 4 ) kill = Def . Xs CAUSE ( XO CHANGE TO ( NOT-ALIVE(X0) ) ) Thus , at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the meaning-structure of these words . It is easy to grasp how to do decompositional semantics , though the details can become complicated ( see Katz 1972 and Kempson 1977 ) . The question now arises , What is the evidence for positing these semantic components out of which meaning representations are constructed ? Probably the central form of linguistic argument in favor of lexical decomposition is based on simplicity of predictions concerning the various semantic properties and relations . Just as syntactic rules , such as transformations , capture syntactic generalizations that might otherwise be missed , so it could be claimed that systems of semantics without decomposition fail to reflect certain generalizations concerning semantic properties and relations . To see this , consider some additional kinship terms such as mother , brother , and sister , with their decompositional definitions : ( Def. 5 ) mother = Def . FEMALE(X) AND X PARENT OF Y ( Def. 6 ) brother = Def . MALE(X) AND X SIBLING OF Y ( Def. 7 ) sister = Def . FEMALE(X) AND X SIBLING OF Y On the basis of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations concerning these and related words . For instance , we can predict that father and brother ( as well as the potentially infinite set including son , uncle , nephew , grandfather , great , grandfather , great-great-grandfather , and so on ) all share the aspect of meaning MALE , and so are similar in meaning in expressing the property of being male . The same holds for the analogous set containing FEMALE . That is , the decompositional representation of this potentially infinite set of kinship words can he given in terms of a very small  | number of repeatable semantic primitives . If we then add a general definition of similarity in meaning ( in terms of repeated semantic primitives ) , it is possible to predict that each of these sets contains words that are similar ( in meaning ) with respect to maleness and femaleness . Moreover , given a definition of contradictory ( in terms of incompatible semantic primitives ) , it is possible to make certain predictions as an automatic consequence of decompositional representation . For instance , we can predict that each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But with male substituted for female , each example is noncontradictory . Furthermore , such a theory can predict simply and directly that the members of each pair in the following potentially infinite list of pairs are synonyms ( both members having identical semantic rep-resentations ) : This form of prediction can be carried out for each semantic property and relation , covering huge parts of the vocabulary of a language . Without lexical decomposition , each of these semantic predictions would have to be made separately for each of these words . Analogously in syntax , grammars without rules having the power of transformations could deal only clumsily , or not at all , with discontinuous constituents and other dependency relations , at the cost of adding many separate but clearly related rules . It might be concluded , then , that grammars excluding decomposition , as well as grammars excluding rules such as transformations , miss obvious generalizations in their respective domains . Again , then , the basic argument in favor of decomposition is simplicity of theory . Such theoretical elegance requires stronger con- ditions of adequacy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaningful words . These definitions not only must provide necessary and sufficient conditions for correct application , but also must be identical for synonyms and nonidentical for nonsynonyms . Some theorists have found such constraints highly desirable in principle but too strong in fact , a contention we will return to toward the end of this chapter . Semantic Restrictions and Relations Words and idioms combine with , and bear various semantic relations to , other words and idioms . So far our dictionary represents intrinsic meaning , but it does not represent semantic restrictions between words . For instance , it can be claimed that there is something anomalous about ( 39 ) , if it is taken literally : ( 39 ) The table is a parent of the chair . This could be accounted for by saying that the variables X and Y in the analysis of parent are restricted to animate objects . Ordinary dictionaries often put such restrictions in terms of what such words are " said of " : ( Def. 8 ) addled = Def. confused , said of minds ; rotten , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semantic restrictions by using angle brackets , ( ) , as in the complete definition of father : ( Def. 9 ) father = Def . MALE(X) AND X PARENT OF Y AND ( ANIMATE(X) AND ANIMATE(Y) ) The angle brackets enclosing ANIMATE(X) AND ANIMATE ( Y ) in Def. 9 restrict the application of father to animate things when it is used literally . The same device can be used to represent the semantic restrictions on kill : ( Def. 10 ) kill = Def . Xs CAUSE ( X ? CHANGE TO ( NOT-ALIVE(X0) ) ) AND ( ANIMATE ( X ? ) )  | This representation makes the claim that whatever is killed must be animate and so predicts that when this restriction is violated , the compound expression will be ( literally ) anomalous , as in ( 40 ) : ( 40 ) John killed the table . Still , none of these definitions is more than a first approximation to a correct one . We will return in the exercises to the question of how they can be improved . If we consider again the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are semantic relations that the dictionary entry alone does not represent . For instance , if X is a boy , then X is not female , and if X is a boy , then X is animate , and so forth . How can we supplement the lexicon so as to account for these and similar facts ? One way would be to add such components as NOT-FEMALE(X) and ANIMATE(X) to our lexical entry for boy ( as well as for other words such as father , brother , and grandfather ) . However , this would seem to miss the generalization that if a word contains MALE as one of its components , then that in itself guarantees that it will also contain ANIMATE and will not contain FEMALE , and so forth . How can each of these conditions be stated once as a single fact ? Theorists all agree that some kind of a meaning rule is needed here that connects these semantic components , but they do not agree on the exact nature of such devices , which have been called redundancy rules by Katz ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For neutrality , we will call such principles inference rules , and they will be added to the lexicon as information concerning semantic relations between words and idioms , separate from any particular lexical entry . For example , the following rules by which one can infer what is on the right-hand side of the arrow from what is on the left-hand side would account for the facts already mentioned about boy : ( IR 1 ) MALE(X) -* NOT-FEMALE(X) ( " Infer NOT-FEMALE(X) from MALE(X) " ) ( IR 2 ) MALE(X) ? ANIMATE(X) ( " Infer ANIMATE(X) from MALE(X) " ) So far it may seem that the addition of inference rules to the lexicon is a matter of theoretical simplicity and that their job of recording cer- tain semantic relations between words could be done , albeit less economically , by decomposition . There are semantic relations between words suggesting that inference rules are not simply elegant ways of stating certain facts , however , but are required . Some semantic relations between words can not plausibly be represented by decomposition : ( 41 ) a . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John likes pizza . c . Mary likes pizza . Although ( 41b ) and ( 41c ) can be inferred from ( 41a ) , it makes no sense to speak of the decomposition of and . Similarly , in the following examples the second member of each pair does not seem to be the result of decomposing the first : ( 42 ) a . Someone likes ice cream . b . It is not true that everyone does not like ice cream . ( 43 ) a . It is possible that someone likes okra. b . It is not necessarily true that not anyone likes okra. ( 44 ) a . His window is red . b . His window has a color . Examples ( 41 ) ? ( 44 ) suggest that inference rules such as the following must be a part of the lexicon : ( IR 3 ) AND Y ? X Y ( " From ( X and Y ) one may infer X and one may infer Y " ) ( IR 4 ) RED(X) ? * COLORED(X) With both lexical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a number of semantic properties and relations , for example , that ( 45a ) entails ( 45b ) :  | a . Someone is a boy . b . Someone is not female . This entailment can be accounted for by our semantic theory in the following way : ( 46 ) a . According to Def. 2 , Someone is a boy means something like SOMEX(X) IS HUMAN(X) AND MALE(X) AND NOT-ADULT(X). b . Then , according to IR 3 , we may infer that MALE(X). ' c . Then , according to IR 1 , we may infer that NOT-FEMALE(X). d . Since the English expression not female can be represented as NOT-FEMALE(X) , we may conclude that SOMEx(X) IS NOTFEMALE(X) . According to this explanation , we show that one sentence entails another sentence when the second can be inferred from the first by decomposition and inference rules . So far , then , we can represent the following three kinds of information in our semantics : meaning ( lexical entry ) , semantic restrictions ( lexical entry ) , and some entailments ( inference rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties and relations can be represented in this format ( see exercises ) . Indeed , it is still an open question in the field of semantics what a descriptively adequate format will look like . Phrases and Sentences So far we can account for the semantics of only words and idioms . We have not yet attempted to account for the semantics of syntactically complex expressions . For this we need a syntactic description of the strings of words that involves more than the parts of speech . We need to know the linear order of the words , the grouping of the words , and the grammatical relations that the various expressions in the phrase or sentence bear to each other . These are properties specified by the syntactic component of a grammar , and the relation between the syntactic component and the semantic component in the standard transformational grammar is shown in figure 6.2 . Syntax Semantics  | Composition An adequate semantic theory must reflect the compositionality of natural language , and to do this it must contain rules that are sensitive to the syntactic structure of phrases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called projection rules ) . To illustrate them and their mode of operation , we consider a simple sentence such as ( 47 ) : ( 47 ) A boy kills a dog . The syntax of ( 47 ) will be simplified somewhat and represented as tree 6.1 , which reflects only semantically relevant structure . Given the meaning of ( 47 ) , we want to be sure that in the semantic representation of this sentence it is the case that the dog dies , not the boy ; whereas in the sentence A dog kills a boy , it is the boy who dies and not the dog . How can this he accomplished ? The first thing that the semantic coin- ponent of the grammar does is to represent the meaning of each word by simply inserting its semantic representation from the lexicon ? where dog is represented as CANINE(X) AND ANIMATE(X) ? as illustrated in tree 6.2 . This completes the semantic representation of the sentence for meaning at the lexical level . We will turn first to the phrase level and then to the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or composing , semantic represen- tations of different words that are grouped together under a single node in the tree , starting at the bottom and working our way up to the Snode . But to compose semantic representations , we need rules of composition to derive representations of complex expressions from representations of simpler ones . The nature and full variety of composition rules are still unresolved , so we will merely illustrate the process with the following three composition rules : ( CR 1 ) Variables in lexical entries that are not categorized for subject or object are given the number index from their dominating NP . ( CR 2 ) Lexical variables that are categorized for subject or object are given the number of the NP they are categorized for . ( CR 3 ) Semantic components are joined with AND , provided semantic restrictions are not violated . Let us see how these rules work . Recall that we apply the rules from the bottom of the tree up , starting with CR 1 , then CR 2 , and finally CR 3 . Both NP , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we will begin with the more deeply embedded one . So the first step is to apply CR 1 to the phrase a dog under N . The result is to subscript the lexical variable X with a 2 ( see tree 6.3 ) . Since CR 2 and CR 3 can not apply , we move to the next higher node , which is NPI . The result of applying CR 1 here is illustrated in tree 6.4 . Again , since CR 2 and CR 3 can not apply , we move to the next higher node , VP.  | The last two composition rules apply at VP ; we will illustrate their application in order . First , notice that in the semantic representation for kill , the variable X is categorized for subject , Xs , and then for direct object , Xo . However , tree 6.5 shows that only the direct object is a constituent at the VP node , so only it , N , can be composed at this point . Since CR 1 does not apply and CR 2 does , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the semantic representation of N meets the semantic restriction on kill , and for simplicity we will henceforth omit the restriction ( ANIMATE ( X0 ) ) in the representation of kill . Now we need only connect the semantic representation of kill to the semantic representation of a dog to derive the semantic representation of the VP kills a dog ( see tree 6.6 ) .  | Finally , we move to the highest node in the sentence , the S-node . So far our semantic representations have been at the word or phrase level . To compose at the S-node is to say how the meaning of the whole sentence is determined by the meaning of its constituent phrases and their grammatical relations . Since CR 1 does not apply and CR 2 does , the result is tree 6.7 , where the subject variable in kill is indexed as XI . This leaves only CR 3 to apply to connect the semantic representation of N with the semantic representation of VP within the sentence , producing tree 6.8 . Although tree 6.8 is not perfect as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog , further refinements are not necessary for our purposes here ( see Bierwisch 1969 , 1971 ) . As we can see , some desired semantic properties and relations are captured . For instance , the fact that sentence ( 47 ) receives a semantic representation at all predicts that the expression is meaningful , and tree 6.8 represents ( imperfectly ) its meaning . Also note that the component NOTALIVE(X2) in tree 6.8 is attached to the same variable , X2 , that the reading for dog is attached to ? CANINE(X2) AND ANIMATE(X2) ? indicating that the dog , not the boy , died . However , had the sentence been ( 48 ) , then a boy would have been the direct object :  | So a boy would have been N and the reading for boy would have been attached to X2 , thereby representing the fact that if ( 48 ) were true , it would be a boy who dies , not a dog . Other semantic properties and relations are captured as well ( see exercises ) . But , more importantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : how the semantic representation of a syntactically complex expression can be determined by the semantic representation of its constituent words and their grammatical relations by means of rules of composition . Finally , we might ask ourselves how this compositional theory might define some of the semantic properties and relations set out earlier . First of all , the theory will , if adequate , generate a semantic representation for every well-formed expression in the language : if the expression is a word or idiom , its meaning is represented in the lexicon ; if the expression is a phrase or sentence , its meaning is represented on the basis of syntactic structure plus composition rules . Since one way or another every meaningful expression will receive a semantic representation in an adequate theory , we can say that an expression is meaningful if it has a semantic representation ; an expression is ambiguous if it is given more than one semantic representation ; two expressions are synonymous if they are given the same semantic representation ; two expressions overlap in meaning if they share a semantic component ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be inferred from the first on the basis of decomposition and inference rules . Notice that although these definitions do capture something essential to the notions of ambiguity , synonymy , overlap of meaning , and so forth , they in effect reduce these notions to the nature and number of semantic representations given by the lexicon and composition rules . But the question , Why does expression E mean what it means ? is not yet answered . It may well be that bachelor means HUMAN(X) AND ADULT(X) AND MALE(X) AND UNMARRIED(X) , but what are we saying about the word bachelor when we say that this is what it means ? Which brings us back to the original question : What is meaning ? That is , what is it for something to have a meaning ? We concluded earlier that currently the most promising account of meaning is in terms of use . If this conclusion is correct , the question of what meaning is leads us to pragmatics , the topic of chapter 9.  | Semantic Representation : Some Issues ( optional sections ) In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semantic theorists , but two particular areas can be mentioned because they are both far-reaching and active topics of investigation . Decomposition vs . Inference Rules One topic of current research and controversy is the relative importance of lexical decomposition and inference rules . On the one hand , Katz ( 1972 ) and Katz and Nagel ( 1974 ) view a substantial portion of the lexicon as susceptible to decomposition ; on the other hand , Jackendoff ( 1972 ) and Fodor , Fodor , and Garrett ( 1975 ) view decomposition as a marginal phenomenon , with inference rules being the predominant piece of semantic machinery . To see the pervasiveness of inference rules , consider again the fact that ( 47 ) , A boy kills a dog , entails ( 49a ) , which has ( 49b ) as its semantic representation : ( 49 ) a . A dog dies . b . SOMEX ANIMATE(X) AND CANINE(X) AND ( CHANGE TO ( NOT-ALIVE(X) ) ) To infer ( 49b ) from ( 47 ) , we must first apply IR 3 to ( 47 ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAUSE ( CHANGE TO ( NOT-ALIVE(X2) ) ) AND SOME ) , CANINE(X2) AND ANIMATE(X2) But to infer ( 49a ) from ( 47 ) , we still need the principle that causing X to change to being not alive entails that X be not alive . In other words , we need another inference rule : ( IR 5 ) X , CAUSE ( CHANGE TO ( NOT-ALIVE(X2) ) ) ? * NOT-ALIVE(X2) When IR 5 applies to ( 50 ) , it gives ( 49a ) as an entailment . We can see that even with this amount of decomposition , we still need inference rules to account for the entailments of kill . A further challenge to decomposition comes from another quarter , from what are called natural-kind terms . These are words such as dog , water , gold , which refer to things ( or stuff ) that form a " kind , " or species , in nature and are governed by particular laws of nature , such as the laws of biology , chemistry , or physics . Some authors ? Kripke  | ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have suggested that these sorts of words function semantically in the language very much like proper names and that both proper names and natural-kind terms should receive an historical chain analysis of their meaning and reference . If that suggestion is correct , then the meaning of such terms would not be represented by decomposition . On the historical chain view , something is gold , for example , if it is the same kind of thing , obeying the same physical laws , as the matter originally dubbed gold when the word was introduced into the language . If such a view is correct ( see Schwartz 1977 for a survey discussion ) , then decomposition is an even more restricted phenomenon than has been supposed . Anaphora and Reference One phenomenon that has interested linguists and logicians for some time is the relation between pronouns ( or noun phrases ) and a set of " antecedent " noun phrases ( see Chomsky 1981 and references cited ) . Such relations are known as anaphoric relations , and can be illustrated as follows : ( 51 ) Co-linked a . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The men liked each other c . Idioms : I lost my way d . Wh-Antecedent : Who thinks that they have been cheated ?  --  ..  - -  e . Quantified-Antecedent : Everyone said that he was tired f . Epithets : He stepped on my foot , the creep ! ( 52 ) Disjointly Linked a . Robert saw Michael b . He likes Sam  | c . John believes him to be rash d . John believes that she is rash e . Sam believes that Sam is rash In each case the second item is linked to the first item in some way that is relevant to how a speaker and hearer communicate ( there would be a misunderstanding if the speaker intended one linking , but the hearer understood another ) . What sorts of linking are these ? This is a difficult question and any answer at present would have to be considered tentative , but it seems likely that some of these links are semantic , whereas others are pragmatic ( see chapter 9 for further discussion ) . One way of getting a feel for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used nonliterally if the link were actually broken . For instance , in ( 52a ) Robert and Michael are disjointly linked , and thus are considered to be distinct in reference . But is this semantic reference or speaker reference ? Well , imagine a person named both Robert and Michael , who sees himself in a mirror at an arcade . If a speaker were to say No one saw Michael , it would be possible to answer literally That 's not so , Robert saw Michael . Although it can be true that Robert is Michael , it is still an odd way of saying what we want to say . Why is this so ? Probably there is a pragmatic presumption to the effect that unless otherwise indicated , subject and object positions of verbs are to be taken as disjoint in speaker reference . This same principle would account for ( 52b ) . A case where the linkage is semantic , and so can not be overridden pragmatically without being nonliteral , is given in ( 51a ) . Here the reflexive pronoun himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the subject of the verb , John . If himself is changed to herself , either one must assume that the speaker is speaking nonliterally in virtue of using the pronoun her , or one must assume that John is being used to refer to some female . These remarks extend to complex cases such as ( 52d ) . Notice that if the name John in these examples is changed to one without gender associations , as in ( 53 ) , one has to know whether Lee is being used to refer to a male or a female in order to determine whether she is linked with Lee or not , preserving literality.  | ( 53 ) Lee believes that she is rash . In some of the above cases , the linking is optional , in that there is another way of construing the sentence literally that does not involve the indicated links . For instance , ( 51d ) and ( 51e ) seem to admit the interpretation indicated below : ( 54 ) a . Who thinks that they have been cheated ? ( Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tired . ( That man over there ) Finally , notice that we can put more than one anaphoric device into a sentence and thereby affect its linking . For instance , ( 55 ) allows he either to be linked to John , or to refer demonstratively to someone else : ( 55 ) John said that he was tired . ( That man over there ) However , if we add as for himself to the sentence , we block the latter possibility . ( 56 ) John said that , as for himself , he was tired . How can the phrase as for himself contribute to establishing the link between John and he ? These are still matters of current research , but the above examples should serve to illustrate that anaphora is a topic rich in connections between morphology , syntax , semantics , and pragmatics . How might we represent these kinds of facts in a semantic theory ? Clearly , we will not want our semantics to represent information that is nonsemantical , but since the distinction is difficult to determine at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case might work and also how a pragmatic case might work . For a semantic case consider Everyone shaves himself . This sentence would receive roughly the syntactic and semantic analysis shown in tree 6.9 . Combining N with the verb yields the result shown in tree 6.10 , and combining this result with N in turn yields tree 6.11 . Again ,  | the semantic rendition of our original sentence is imperfect , but the effect of the semantics is clear , and the result entails that all the people shave themselves and they are all males ? which is what the original entails . For a pragmatic case consider ( 52e ) , Sam believes that Sam is rash . This sentence has roughly the syntactic structure shown in tree 6.12 . When a noun phrase ( such as N ) precedes another noun phrase that is a proper name ( such as N ) , and is also " higher " in the tree structure ( as in tree 6.12 ) than the second NP , then the two NPs will be subject to the following presumption : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Presumption of Disjoint Reference If a speaker utters a sentence with a structure such as that shown in tree 6.12 , then the hearer may assume that the speaker intends to refer to two distinct persons ( or things ) , unless there is some reason to think the same person or thing is being referred to . Given the PDR , sentence ( 52e ) will be understood by a hearer to involve references to two distinct persons , unless the context of utterance overrides it . This can happen in cases like the following : ( 58 ) Speaker A : Everybody believes Sam is rash . Speaker B : But does Sam believe himself to be rash ? Speaker A : Sure , since everybody believes Sam is rash , so Sam ( pointing to Sam ) must believe that Sam is rash . This example illustrates again the important difference between semantic constraints and these sorts of pragmatic constaints . If the speaker chooses to override semantic constraints , then he or she will be speaking nonliterally . However , if the pragmatic constraint is overridden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hearer will now have to figure out what the speaker is referring to , given that the most obvious presumption is not in effect . In this way we can see that all levels of a grammar can be called upon to explain related aspects of language structure and communication .  | Study Questions 1 .

" Criticize or defend this claim in terms of evidence based on the information presented in chapters 3 through 6.  | LANGUAGE VARIATION 7.1 LANGUAGE STYLES AND DIALECTS No human language is fixed , uniform , or unvarying : all languages show internal variation . Actual usage varies from group to group , and speaker to speaker , in terms of the pronunciation of a language , the choice of words and the meaning of those words , and even the use of syntactic constructions . To take a well-known example , the speech of Americans is noticeably different from the speech of the British , and the speech of these two groups in turn is distinct from the speech of Australians . When groups of speakers differ noticeably in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialects of the language . Dialectal Variation It is notoriously difficult , however , to define precisely what a dialect is , and in fact the term has come to be used in various ways . The classic example of a dialect is the regional dialect : the distinct form of a language spoken in a certain geographical area . For example , we might speak of Ozark dialects or Appalachian dialects , on the grounds that inhabitants of these regions have certain distinct linguistic features that differentiate them from speakers of other forms of English . We can also speak of a social dialect : the distinct form of a language spoken by members of a specific socioeconomic class , such as the working class dialects in England or the ghetto languages in the United States ( to which we will return ) . In addition , certain ethnic dialects can be distinguished , such as the form of English sometimes referred to as Yiddish English , historically associated with speakers of Eastern European Jewish ancestry .  | It is important to note that dialects are never purely regional , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the distinctive Ozark and Appalachian dialects are not merely dialects spoken by any of the inhabitants of those geographical areas . Rather , they are dialects used primarily by a certain social class in these regions , namely , low-income rural inhabitants . As we shall see , regional , social , and ethnic factors combine and intersect in various ways in the identification of dialects . In popular usage the term dialect refers to a form of a language that is regarded as " substandard , " " incorrect , " or " corrupt , " as opposed to the " standard , " " correct , " or " pure " form of a language . In popular terms , to speak a dialect is to be uneducated and ignorant . In sharp contrast , the term dialect , as a technical term in linguistics , carries no value judgment and simply refers to a distinct form of a language . Thus , for example , linguists refer to so-called Standard English as a dialect of English , which , from a linguistic point of view , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English . From this point of view , the monarchs of England and teenagers in Los Angeles and New York all speak dialects of English . Although dialects are often said to be regional , social , or ethnic , linguists also use the term dialect to refer to language variations that can not be tied to any geographical area , social class , or ethnic group . Rather , this use of dialect simply indicates that speakers show some variation in the way they use elements of the language . For example , some speakers of English are perfectly comfortable using the word anymore in sentences such as the following : ( 1 ) a . Tools are expensive anymore . Here , anymore means roughly the same as nowadays or lately . Other speakers of English can use anymore only if there is a negative element , such as not , in the sentence : ( 1 ) b . Tools are not cheap anymore . As far as we can tell , this difference between speakers can not be linked to a particular region of the country or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variation does not end with dialects . For each recognizable dialect of a language is itself subject to considerable internal variation : no two speakers of a language , even if they are speakers of the  | same dialect , produce and use their language in exactly the same way . We are able to recognize different individuals by their distinct speech and language patterns ; indeed , a person 's language is one of the most fundamental features of self-identity . The form of a language spoken by a single individual is referred to as an idiolect , and every speaker of a language has a distinct idiolect . Once we realize that variation in language is pervasive , it becomes apparent that there is no such thing as a single language used at all times by all speakers . There is no such thing as a single English language ; rather , there are many English languages ( dialects and idiolects ) depending on who is using the language and what the context of use is . Consider the well-known phenomenon of variation in vocabulary words that exists among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means " cola " in some parts of the South . b . Pocketbook means " purse " in Boston and in parts of the South . c . Fetch up means " raise " ( children ) in the South . d . Pavement means " sidewalk " in eastern Pennsylvania and in England . e . Happygrass means " grasshopper " in eastern Virginia . f . Bubbler means " water fountain " in Wisconsin . g . Knock up means " to wake someone up by knocking " in England . h . Bonnet means " hood " ( of a car ) in England . i . Fag means " cigarette " in England . As the last three examples indicate , vocabulary differences between American and British English are common and often amusing . Indeed , the Bell Telephone System has published a pamphlet entitled " Getting Around the USA : Travel Tips for the British Visitor , " which contains a section entitled " How to Say It . " In this section we find the following correspondences : Table  | These examples are typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of British and American English . Mutual Intelligibility Given the existence of dialectal and idiolectal variation , what allows us to refer to something called English , as if it were a single , monolithic language ? A standard answer to this question rests on the notion of mutual intelligibility . That is , even though native speakers of English vary in their use of the language , their various languages are similar enough in pronunciation , vocabulary , and grammar to permit mutual intelligibility . A New Yorker , a Texan , and a Californian may recognize differences in each other 's language , but they can understand each other ( despite all the jokes to the contrary ) and they recognize each other as speaking the " same language . " Hence , speaking the " same language " does not depend on two speakers speaking identical languages , but only very similar languages . In discussing the notion of mutual intelligibility , it is interesting to note , by way of contrast , cases that might be called one-way intelligibility , involving speakers of different , but historically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portuguese who do not know Spanish can often understand the forms of Spanish spoken in neighboring countries . The analogous Spanish speakers , however , find Portuguese largely unintelligible . A similar situation holds between Danish and Swedish : speakers of Danish can ( more or less ) comprehend Swedish , but the reverse situation is much less common . Even if one group of speakers can understand another group , they can not be said to speak the same language unless the second group also understands the first , and thus the notion of mutual intelligibility is crucial in specifying when two languages are the " same " language .  | Although the notion of mutual intelligibility seems like a reasonable criterion in defining dialects , the situation can be considerably complicated by social and political factors . In China , for example , a northern Chinese speaker of the Beijing dialect ( also known as Mandarin ) can not understand the speech of a southern Chinese speaker of Cantonese , and vice versa . For this reason , a linguist might well label Mandarin and Cantonese as two distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese language , both Mandarin and Cantonese are regarded as " dialects " of Chinese , given that they are historically related ( that is , they may have been offshoots of several closely related dialects that existed earlier in the history of the Chinese language ) . Moreover , both Mandarin and Cantonese are spoken in the same nation ( they are not languages of two different countries with different governments ) , and speakers of both " dialects " can use the written language ( in the form of Chinese characters ) as a common language of communication . For such reasons , the tendency has persisted to use the term " dialect " to refer to various mutually unintelligible forms of the Chinese language . Historical and political factors can also give rise to the opposite situation , namely , where two mutually intelligible forms are not considered dialects of the same language , but rather two distinct languages . For example , Papago and Pima are two Native American languages spoken by members of tribal groups living in the state of Arizona and in northern Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are extremely close phonologically and grammatically , with only minor linguistic differences in pronunciation and syntax ( the differences between them being less radical than the differences between American and British English ) . For this reason , a linguist could well consider Papago and Pima to be two dialects of the same language . Nevertheless , the two tribal groups , for historical and political reasons , consider themselves distinct political entities , and consider their languages as distinct languages rather than dialectal variations of a single language . Having examined some of the complications involved in the term dialect , how can we define it ? No satisfactory definition of dialect has yet been proposed , but for our purposes we will ignore complications and settle on a very general one . A dialect is simply a distinct form of a language , possibly associated with a recognizable regional , social , or ethnic group , differentiated from other forms of the language by specific linguistic features ( for example , pronunciation , or vocabulary ,  | or grammar , or any combination of these ) . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain intuitive idea of the term dialect , but one that seems useful . In any event , it must be kept in mind that from a linguistic point of view dialect is a theoretical concept . In reality , variation in language is so pervasive that each language is actually a continuum of languages from speaker to speaker , and from group to group , and no absolute lines can be drawn between different forms of a language . Dialects and the Interplay of Regional and Social Factors : New York City /r/ As we have mentioned , the classic example of a dialect is the regional dialect , the assumption being that speakers of the dialect form a coherent speech community living in relative isolation from speakers outside the community . Such relative isolation between geographical areas is becoming increasingly more rare in the contemporary world , and in the United States the population as a whole is so geographically and socially mobile that it is becoming increasingly more difficult to speak of regional dialects in any pure sense . Especially in large urban areas , a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by social factors . An interesting example of the effect of " social prestige " on a regional dialect is found in the pronunciation of /r/ in New York City speech . The so-called r-less dialect of New York City is so well known that it is often the subject of humor , especially on the part of the New Yorkers who themselves speak it . It is commonly thought that speakers of the dialect completely lack /r/ in words such as car , card , four , fourth , and so on , but this is a misconception , as an intriguing study by the sociolinguist William Labov ( 1972 ) reveals . Labov began with the hypothesis that New York City speakers vary in their pronunciation of /r/ according to their social status . Labov interviewed salespeople at several New York City department stores that differed in price range and social prestige . Assuming that salespeople tend to " borrow prestige " from their customers , Labov predicted that the social stratification of customers at different department stores would be mirrored in a similar stratification of salespeople . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest-ranked store will have the highest values of ( r ) ; those in the  | middle-ranked store will have intermediate values of ( r ) ; and those in the lowest-ranked store will show the lowest values " ( 1972 , 45 ) . Labov chose three stores : Saks Fifth Avenue ( high prestige ) , Macy 's ( middle level ) , and S. Klein ( low prestige ) . He interviewed salespeople by asking them a question that would elicit the answer fourth floor : The interviewer approached the informant in the role of a customer asking for directions to a particular department . The department was one which was located on the fourth floor . When the interviewer asked , " Excuse me , where are the women 's shoes ? " the answer would normally be , " Fourth floor . " The interviewer then leaned forward and said , " Excuse me ? " He would usually then obtain another utterance , " Fourth floor , " spoken in careful style under emphatic stress . ( 1972 , 49 ) The phrase fourth floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to variation in the pronunciation of New York City speakers , and Labov was able to study both casual and careful pronunciations of this phrase . The result turned out to correlate in an interesting way with the hypothesis . For example , Labov found that at Saks , 30 percent of the salespeople interviewed always pronounced both /r/ 's in the test phrase ; at Macy 's 20 percent did so ; and at Klein 's only 4 percent did . In addition , Labov found that 32 percent of the interviewed salespeople at Saks had variable pronunciation of /r/ ( sometimes /r/ was pronounced and sometimes not , depending on context ) ; at Macy 's 31 percent of the interviewees had variable pronunciation ; and at Klein 's only 17 percent did . These overall results do suggest that pronunciation of /r/ in New York City is correlated , at least loosely , with social stratification of the speakers . What about the differences in pronunciation between the casual and the emphatic styles ? It turns out that in the casual response the /r/ of floor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 44 percent at Macy 's , and only 8 percent at Klein 's . In contrast , in the careful , emphatic response the /r/ of floor was pronounced by 64 percent at Saks , 61 percent at Macy 's ( note the jump from 44 percent ) , and 18 percent at Klein 's . In other words , at Saks there was very little difference between casual and careful pronunciations , whereas at Macy 's and Klein 's the difference between these styles was significantly larger . This suggests that speakers at the middle and lower levels of the New York City social scale are perfectly aware that a final /r/ occurs in words such as floor . Even though they omit this /r/ in casual pronunciation , it reappears in careful speech :  | In emphatic pronunciation of the final ( r ) , Macy 's employees come very close to the mark set by Saks . It would seem that r-pronunciation is the norm at which a majority of Macy employees aim , yet not the one they use most often . In Saks , we see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much less marked . In other words , Saks employees have more security in a linguistic sense . ( 1972 , 51 ? 52 ) As we will see again in section 7.2 , the difference between casual and careful language styles is important in syntactic variation as well . Hypercorrection In connection with the pronunciation of New York City it is interesting to note that some New York City speakers insert /r/ in words where it does not actually occur in spelling . One can hear Cuba pronounced kyuwbr , saw pronounced sod , idea pronounced aydiyr , and so on . It seems that the very speakers who drop out /r/ in some words and positions will insert an /r/ in other words and positions . The cause of this phenomenon is sometimes thought to be hypercorrection ( that is , overcorrection ) : speakers who have been persuaded that it is " incorrect " to drop /r/ will overcompensate or overcorrect for this by inserting the sound where it does not actually occur in spelling . ( Overcompensation can be seen in syntax with speakers who say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the grounds that I is more " correct " and " cultured " than me . ) However , we might question whether , for given speakers , inserting /r/ involves only hypercorrection . For one thing , even those speakers who insert /r/ do not always pronounce words such as idea with a final /r/ : the insertion of /r/ on such words happens only when the next word begins with a vowel ( hence , we could hear phrases such as the idear I heard about but not the idear John told me about ) . The insertion of /r/ is thus at least partially governed by a phonological principle . In the second place , hypercorrection often involves imitating what is thought to be prestige language . For example , a hypercorrect phrase such as It is I is thought to sound more prestigious than It 's me , even though there is nothing grammatically incorrect about the latter phrase . Returning to words such as idear , speakers who insert /r/ in idear may not think that such a pronunciation is prestigious . Since insertion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since it may not involve imitation of prestige language , for some speakers this insertion of /r/ is not strictly a case of hypercorrection.  | The Labov study illustrates once again that there is often no absolute or simple distinction between one dialect and another : we can not simply say that the New York City dialect is r-less . Rather , the pronunciation of /r/ in that dialect is variable , and this variation seems to be correlated both with social factors and with the casual or careful context . Thus , just as no language can be said to be unvarying or fixed , so no dialect of a language can be said to be unvarying or fixed either . Finally , not even the language of an individual speaker is unvarying : an individual New Yorker may well show variation in pronouncing In . " Standard " versus " Nonstandard " Language A pervasive phenomenon of societies in the contemporary world is the designation of one dialect of a language as the " standard , " " correct , " or " pure " form of the language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or SAE , for short ) is a form of the language used in news programs in the national media ( often referred to as " Network English " ) ; it is the language of legal and governmental functions ; and it is the language used in the schools as a vehicle for education . As noted earlier , in linguistic terms no one dialect of a language is any more correct , any better , or any more logical than any other dialect of the language : all dialects are equally effective forms of language , in that any idea or desire that can be expressed in one dialect can be expressed just as easily in any other dialect . The idea that SAE is the correct form of the language is a social attitude ? more precisely , a language prejudice ? which is just as irrational as social prejudices involving race or sex . In America the so-called standard language is perhaps most widely identified with the educated white middle class ; hence , a good case can be made that the reverence for the standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the far more general bias in the United States toward considering the white middle-class value system the correct or best value system . It is important to realize at the outset that labeling one particular dialect as standard and others as inferior reflects a sociopolitical judgment , not a linguistic judgment . Indeed , in countries throughout the world , the standard national language is the dialect of the subculture with the most prestige and power .  | Black English and the Verb Be A well-known example of a social dialect that has been labeled as nonstandard is Black English . In a certain sense the term Black English ( or BE , for short ) is misleading in that it suggests that all Black Americans speak the same dialect and use it all the time . Both impressions are incorrect . Black Americans show as much linguistic variation as any other social group in the nation ; language is not determined by race . Further , even those who can be said to use BE do not necessarily use this dialect at all times . Essentially , BE refers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusively ) used by Black residents of low-income ghettos in large urban areas of the United States . Although BE is also used by certain Latinos and Whites who live in the same ghetto areas , BE is stereotypically associated with Black residents of the ghetto . In recent years , BE has attracted a good deal of attention from linguists ( see references ) , whose investigations have shown quite clearly that BE is every bit as rule-governed and as logical as SAE . In a series of important studies Labov ( see references ) has demonstrated that there are several important and highly systematic relationships between BE and SAE . To take what is perhaps the best-known example , consider the frequently noted fact that in BE present tense forms of the verb to be are often dropped in casual speech ( examples taken from Labov 1969a ) . ( 4 ) a . She the first one started us off . b . He fast in everything he do . c . I know , but he wild , though . d . You out the game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not black . g . They not caught . h . Boot always comin ' over my house to eat . i . He gon ' try to get up . The omission of the verb to be in Black English can easily be misinterpreted by those untrained in linguistics as evidence that BE is a kind of defective dialect that violates rules of grammar or , worse yet , has no rules of grammar . As ahoy ( 1969b ) notes , this has even led to the mistaken view on the part of certain educators and psychologists  | that Black children entering school have a language deficit and are culturally deprived . Even though the omission of forms of the verb to be may at first appear to make BE quite distinct from SAE , Labov ( 1969b , 203 ) points out that The deletion of the is or are in BE is not the result of erratic or illogical behavior : it follows the same regular rules as standard English contraction . Wherever standard English can contract , BE can use either the contracted form or ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They mine corresponds to standard They 're mine , not to the full form They are mine . On the other hand , no such deletion is possible in positions where standard English can not contract : just as one can not say That 's what they 're in standard English , That 's what they is equally impossible in the vernacular we are considering . In the examples already cited , the correspondence between SAE and BE is as follows : SAE : Contraction BE : Deletion She 's the first one . . . She the first one .. . He 's fast . . . He fast .. . You 're out . . . You out .. . They 're not caught . They not caught . Both dialects have contraction , but only BE has the further option of deleting a contractible form of to be . What appears at first to be a significant difference between SAE and BE actually turns out to be rather minor . Indeed , in both dialects the same general phenomenon is taking place : the verb to be ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casual speech when it is unstressed . One dialect reflects the reduction process by contraction alone , the other dialect by contraction or deletion . As we shall see , in fact , the deletion of the verb to be ( and other auxiliary verbs ) is by no means limited to BE , but happens quite generally in the informal style in all dialects of American English . Another grammatical feature of Black English that has been noted in linguistic studies is a certain use of the verb to be illustrated by examples such as the following ( taken from Fasold 1972 ( chap . 4 ) ) : ( 5 ) a . I get a ball and then some children be on one team and some he on another team . b . Christmas Day , well , everybody he so choked up over gifts and everything , they do n't he too hungry anyway .  | d . My father be the last one to open his presents . e . Yes , there always be fights . f . On Saturdays , I like to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of be has been termed invariant be ( since it does not vary either to reflect past or present tense , or to agree with the subject ) , and it indicates a habitual and repeatable action , state , or event . Thus , invariant be is typically used in general descriptions ( as in ( 5a ) , a description of a game ) and to indicate customary or typical states of affairs . Given this , note that it is unacceptable in Black English to say *He be working right now , since the time expression right now does not have a habitual interpretation , but rather refers to the specific present . In addition , whereas one can say He my brother ( SAE He 's my brother ) , it is unacceptable to say *He be my brother , since the sibling relation is permanent over time ; that is , it is not repeatable over time ( invariant be is used to indicate actions , states , or events that can be repeated ) . The use of invariant be has been cited as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a genuine difference between BE and other American dialects . In discussions of Black English , there has been an all too unfortunate tendency to compare BE to SAE without paying sufficient attention to the level of formality of the languages being compared . That is , BE refers to an informal-style language used in the ghetto by ghetto residents ( within the culture of the Black ghetto there are more formal styles of language as well : for example , Afro-American religious preaching styles ? see Smitherman 1977 ) . BE has been compared with formal-style SAE , and thus an informal oral language has been compared with an " official " language of news broadcasts , governmental functions , and school settings . It is no surprise that significant differences have been found . However , when we examine informal styles of American English , we find similar features across all dialects , and it turns out that certain features of BE are simply part of the general linguistic features of informal English . It is crucial to distinguish between formal and informal styles of language before one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Informal Language Styles Without being aware of it , each speaker of any language has mastered a number of language styles . To illustrate , in a formal setting someone  | might offer coffee to a guest by saying May I offer you some coffee ? or perhaps Would you care for some coffee ? In an informal setting the same speaker might well say Want some coffee ? or even Coffee ? This shift in styles is completely unconscious and automatic ; indeed , it takes some concentration and hard introspection to realize that we each use a formal and an informal style on different occasions . The clearest cases of formal speech occur in social contexts that are formal , serious , often official in some sense , in which speakers feel they must watch their language and in which the manner of saying something is regarded as socially important . These contexts would include a formal job interview , meeting an important person , and standing before a court of law . Informal speech in our use of that term occurs in casual , relaxed social settings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speaker . Social settings for this style of speech would include chatting with close friends and interacting in an intimate or family environment or in similar relaxed settings . Some speakers of English , notably self-styled educated speakers , often equate the formal language style with the so-called standard language ; the informal style , if discussed at all , is dubbed a form of sloppy speech or even slang , especially in language classes in public schools . But on closer investigation of the actual details of informal language , it turns out that the informal style , far from being merely a sloppy form of language , is governed by rules every bit as precise , logical , and rigorous as the rules governing formal language . ( Of course , the informal style also has idiosyncrasies and irregularities ? but , then , the formal style does too . ) In section 7.2 we will concentrate on some of the rules of the informal style because a detailed study of the syntactic differences between formal and informal language styles reveals a number of important ideas about language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versus nonstandard language in particular . 7.2 SOME RULES OF THE GRAMMAR OF INFORMAL STYLE IN ENGLISH A well-known difference between formal and informal language styles in English ( and indeed in many other languages ) is that the informal style can be characterized as having a greater amount of abbreviation , shortening , contraction , and deletion . Compare the formal Would you care for some coffee ? with the informal Want some coffee ? The formal style is often redundant and verbose , whereas the informal style is  | brief , to the point , and grammatically streamlined . In this section we will concentrate on two important grammatical features of the informal style , ( a ) the dropping of the subject of the sentence and ( b ) the dropping of the auxiliary verb , these being two central features of the abbreviated style . The abbreviated style we will describe here is based on the language of the authors of this book , and all grammatical judgments will be based on our own speech . We have tested and confirmed our judgments with those of numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the abbreviation processes we describe are quite general within American English . Some readers may find that their own judgments differ from ours at certain points , and this will be entirely natural ; indeed , there could be no better illustration of the topic of this chapter . The important point is that every speaker of English has an abbreviated style in casual speech . Consequently , readers will be able to judge for themselves how accurate we are in describing the abbreviated style in general . Tag-controlled Deletion To begin , let us consider sentences that end in tag questions : ( 6 ) a . You 've been hitting the bottle again , have n't you ? b . He wants me to pay the bill , does he ! c . She likes her new house , does she ! d . He 's failing his courses , is n't he ? e . They 'll steal my money , will they ! f . You 're getting pretty excited , are n't you ? g . You 're not ready to swim fifty laps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tag questions ? have n't you , does he , and so on ? reflect at least two important properties of a sentence : ( a ) the tag contains the auxiliary verb found in the main sentence or ( in the case of do ) the auxiliary appropriate to the main sentence , and ( b ) the pronoun in the tag agrees with the subject of the sentence . The tag question thus contains , in part , a repetition of some of the information found in the main sentence . In the informal , abbreviated style , the subject and the auxiliary of the main sentence can in fact he dropped out when these elements are identical with the pronoun and auxiliary of the tag : p 300 a . Been hitting the bottle again , have n't you ? b . Wants me to pay the bill , does he ? c . Likes her new house , does she ? d . Failing his courses , is n't he ? e . Steal my money , will they ? f . Getting pretty excited , are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are you ? Let us refer to the process illustrated here as Tag-controlled Deletion , described as follows : given a sentence with a tag question , the subject and the auxiliary ( if any ) of the main sentence may be deleted if they are identical with the pronoun and the auxiliary of the tag question . Tag-controlled Deletion is a rule of the abbreviated style in informal language . Notice that there is nothing incomplete about the sentences in ( 7 ) . Even though the subjects and auxiliaries are missing from the main clauses , we can easily recover this information from the tag question . The sentences are formed by a regular rule . Further , they show another regularity : if the subject is deleted , then the auxiliary must be deleted also . Consider the following examples , which , as far as we know , are not possible for any speakers : ( 8 ) a. *Have been hitting the bottle again , have n't you ? b . Is failing his courses , is n't he ? c. *Will steal my money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't you ? We can make a firm judgment that these sentences are bad , indicating that there is a rule at work here that is being followed strictly . The abbreviation process is hardly sloppy . How can we account for the fact that the auxiliary verb may not remain behind if the subject of the sentence has been deleted ? Labov 's observations on contraction suggest that we consider the fact that subjects and auxiliaries are often contracted . Along with You have been hitting the bottle ( have uncontracted ) goes You 've been hitting the bottle ( have contracted as ' ve ) . If the rule is that the subject of the sentence can be deleted only if the auxiliary verb is contracted onto it , sentences such as those in ( 8 ) will never occur : the auxiliary will always be de- leted along with the subject , since it is contracted onto the subject and forms a single unit with it . To form a sentence such as Been hitting the bottle again , have n't you ? , we do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the single contracted element you 've . What happens when the auxiliary verb of the sentence can not be contracted onto the subject ? For example , consider what happens when the auxiliary is negative : ( 9 ) You have n't been hitting the bottle again , have you ? Even though the sequence you have can be contracted to you 've , the sequence you have n't can not be contracted to *you've n't ? no such form exists in English . For a sequence such as you have not been , we can either contract the subject and auxiliary , as in you 've not been , or we can contract the auxiliary and the negative , as in you have n't been , but we can not contract both ( *you've n't ) . It is striking that negative auxiliaries , unlike positive auxiliaries , can remain behind if the subject is deleted : ( 10 ) a . Have n't been hitting the bottle again , have you ? b . Are n't getting too excited , are you ? c . Does n't like all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take too much time , will it ? We now have an interesting explanation for the contrast in the following sentences : ( 11 ) a. *Have been hitting the bottle again , have n't you ? b . Have n't been hitting the bottle again , have you ? Example ( 1la ) is not a possible sentence , but ( 1 lb ) is . On the surface this might seem at first to indicate randomness , irregularity , or sloppiness in the abbreviated style . But a more careful consideration of the details reveals that have in ( 11a ) is a contractible auxiliary , whereas have n't can not be contracted . This suggests the following revision in our Tag-controlled Deletion rule :  | Tag-controlled Deletion ( revised ) Given a sentence with a tag question , the subject of the main sentence may be deleted , under the following conditions : a. the subject must be identical with the pronoun in the tag , and b. if the main sentence contains an auxiliary , it must be contracted onto the subject if it can be contracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be contracted onto the subject , it must be , before the subject can be deleted . Since this has not happened , ( 11a ) is a bad sentence . However , in ( l lb ) have n't can not in any event be contracted onto the subject ; thus , condition ( b ) of the rule is not relevant and the subject can be deleted . Notice that the Tag-controlled Deletion rule , as stated in ( 12 ) , has some interesting consequences . Auxiliary will has a contracted form , ' 11 ; compare It will get on your nerves and It 'll get on your nerves . In contrast , however , an auxiliary such as could has no such contracted form : from the sentence It could get on your nerves we can not derive another in which could is contracted or shortened . Rule ( 12 ) now makes a prediction : since will can contract with the subject , it should not be possible to leave will behind if the subject is deleted ; since could has no contracted form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject is deleted . This prediction seems to us to be true : it seems fine to say Could get on your nerves , could n't it ? , but *Will get on your nerves , wo n't it ? seems bad . Further , negative wo n't ( a contraction of will + not ) differs from positive will in that it can remain behind , as in Wo n't get on your nerves , will it ? But , then , wo n't has no further contracted form : the sequence it wo n't can not be contracted in any way . Again , the uncontractible auxiliary can remain after the subject has been deleted . We have now set up a system wherein the deletion of the subject is dependent upon contraction of the subject with the auxiliary , wherever this is possible . As we saw , in Black English the link between contraction and deletion is crucial , and it turns out that this link is just as crucial in the general abbreviated style of American English . We have by no means exhausted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are only one part of the general deletion processes that affect subject and auxiliary in abbreviated style . We now turn to some other cases .  | Abbreviated Questions Deletion of Subject and Auxiliary Do Let us continue our study of informal style by noting again sentences of a sort discussed earlier : ( 13 ) You want some coffee ? ( 14 ) Want some coffee ? We will refer to questions such as ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) as abbreviated questions , inasmuch as certain elements are missing or deleted . Such abbreviated questions occur quite commonly in the informal speech style and are one of the more interesting features of that style . In example ( 14 ) the subject of the sentence , you , has been dropped . In example ( 13 ) another deletion process seems to be at work : the deletion of the auxiliary verb do . We propose that a sentence such as ( 13 ) derives from a sentence such as ( 15 ) : ( 15 ) Do you want some coffee ? When the auxiliary verb do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 ) . Do we have further evidence for this hypothesis ? After all , we need not assume that these examples involve a deletion of do . We could just as easily say that You want some coffee ? is the declarative sentence You want some coffee with a rising question intonation placed on it . Why should we assume any involvement of the verb do in this process ? When we examine a new set of examples drawn from a wider range of data , the do-deletion hypothesis is confirmed . Consider the following : ( 16 ) Last night 's party go well ? ( 17 ) She like her new house ? These are perfectly good examples of the informal speech style that we are discussing ; we would suggest repeating them ( perhaps aloud ) to get a feeling for how they would sound in rapid informal speech . The point  | to notice is the form of the verbs in ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) : they are the infinitive ( " tenseless " ) forms go and like . Now examine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Last night 's party went well . ( 19 ) She likes her new house . In these examples the verbs reflect tense ( past tense went ) and number ( third person likes ) . If we placed a question intonation on the declarative sentences in ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) , we would simply get the questions Last night 's party went well ? and She likes her new house ? We would not derive ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) . The verbs in ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) show no tense or number agreement . This is precisely the form such verbs take in questions with do : ( 20 ) Did last night 's party go well ? ( 21 ) Does she like her new house ? If we now assume that in informal speech the verb do ( did , does ) can be dropped , we will arrive at just the right verb form for abbreviated questions : ( 22 ) Did last night 's party go well -* Last night 's party go well ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like her new house ? Hence , to account for the verb forms in ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) , we assume that do is deleted from these abbreviated questions and that they are not regular declarative sentences with rising intonation . Of course , as already noted , along with ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) we do have such declarative sentences in the form of questions : Last night 's party went well ? and She likes her new house ? It is interesting that these differ from ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) not only structurally ( in terms of the verb forms ) but also in terms of their use . For example , a declarative sentence with question intonation such as Last night 's party went well ? seems to be used in a conversation only if the questioner expects that the party did go well  | and is asking for confirmation of that expectation . In other words the question Last night 's party went well ? is used in much the same way as the question So , I take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? In contrast , an abbreviated question such as Last night 's party go well ? could be used even if it is a genuine request for information and does not imply that the questioner has any expectations either way about the party . It is striking that such subtle differences in use should be associated with the simple , and apparently trivial , difference between go and went . Given what we have said , it is interesting to note that ( 13 ) ? You want some coffee ? ? could be either an abbreviated question from which do has been deleted or a simple declarative sentence with question intonation . Although it could be either , our concern here will be with its use as an abbreviated question with missing do Turning now to a second piece of evidence that auxiliary do drops out from questions in the abbreviated style , consider examples such as the following : ( 24 ) Last night 's party not go too well ? Let us concentrate here on the negative word , not . In a simple declarative sentence not can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , ( 25 ) is impossible . Rather , the verb do turns up in such examples , as in ( 26 ) ( recall the discussion of auxiliary verbs in chapter 5 ) : ( 25 ) *Last night 's party not went too well . ( 26 ) Last night 's party did not go too well . One question form of ( 26 ) is as follows : ( 27 ) Did last night 's party not go too well ? Given ( 27 ) , we again see that dropping the verb do ( did ) gives just the right form for abbreviated questions such as ( 24 ) . Thus , there are at least two good reasons to assume that such informal questions as You want some coffee ? and Last night 's party go well ? are derived by deleting the auxiliary verb , in this case do .  | We have seen that two deletion processes are at work to produce abbreviated questions : deletion of do and deletion of the second person subject you . Hence , from Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee ? and Want some coffee ? However , note the following restriction , already encountered in Tag-controlled Deletion : even though it is possible to delete the auxiliary verb without deleting the subject you , it is never possible to delete the subject you without also deleting the auxiliary verb do , as ( 28 ) illustrates . ( 28 ) Do you want some coffee ? -* *Do want some coffee ? We have derived the impossible form *Do want some coffee ? by deleting the subject you but failing to delete the auxiliary verb as well . Again it is important to note that even in the abbreviated informal style , precise grammatical rules must be followed . At this point , what can we add to our account in order to guarantee that whenever the subject you is deleted , the auxiliary verb will be deleted as well ? It is not only in declarative statements that auxiliary verbs in English undergo processes of reduction and contraction ; contraction happens in questions as well . Consider the following facts : ( 29 ) The sequence do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d' ya dya or ja jai : D' you like dancing ? D' ya like dancing ? or Ja like dancing ? ( 30 ) The sequence did you in a question is often pronounced didja di jo or djou juw : Didja like the party ? or Djou like the party ? These processes of reduction and contraction are common enough among speakers of English that one even hears abbreviated exchanges such as ( 31 ) a . Jeet ? ( = Didja eat ? = Did you eat ? ) b . No , djou ? ( = No , did you ? )  | We can now make use of these contraction facts to explain the nonexistence of *Do want some coffee ? just as we did in the case of Tag-controlled Deletion . Once again , suppose that we begin with the full question form , Do you want some coffee ? At this point let us assume that either contraction of the auxiliary verb do with the subject you can occur ( producing d' you , d' ya , or ja ) or deletion of auxiliary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want some coffee ? Contraction Deletion D' ya want some coffee ? You want some coffee ? Notice that once the verb do is contracted with the subject you , the result is the form d' ya ( or ja or d' you ) , which is a single word ( inasmuch as contraction is the process of taking independent morphemes and fusing them into a single word unit ) . If we assume that you is deleted only if the auxiliary verb is contracted onto it , it will automatically be the case that whenever the subject is deleted , the auxiliary verb is too : they are deleted together as a single contracted unit . Hence , it is not you that is deleted , but some contracted form such as d' you , d' ya , ja , or djou . The undesirable case *Do want some coffee ? never arises because you will not delete if do is not contracted onto it . At this point we have refined our account sufficiently to posit the following two rules in the grammar of the informal abbreviated style : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form an abbreviated question , the auxiliary verb ( do ) can be deleted , or else it can be contracted onto the subject you . Rule 2 . In forming an abbreviated question , the second person subject you can be deleted as long as an auxiliary verb is contracted onto it . These rules correctly describe the cases we have dealt with so far . Deletion of Have l , et us now ask whether do is the only auxiliary verb that can be deleted in abbreviated questions . As it turns out , the following data indicate that the auxiliary verb have can he deleted as well :  | ( 34 ) a . ( You ) seen John lately ? ( = Have you seen John lately ? ) b . ( You ) picked up your laundry yet ? ( = Have you picked ... ) c . She been sick these days ? ( = Has she been ... ) d . Your job been getting you down ? ( = Has your job been ... ) In these cases auxiliary have has been deleted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Notice once again that even though have and you can both be deleted , it is impossible to delete you without also deleting have : ( 35 ) , a. *Have seen John lately ? b. *Have picked up your laundry yet ? In this respect have behaves just like do . And just as do contracts with you , so also have contracts with you ; that is , the sequence have you can be pronounced ' vyou ( vyuw , rhyming with the word view ) or ' vya ( vya ) : ( 36 ) a. ' vyou seen John lately ? b. ' vyou picked up your laundry yet ? Once again , we will assume that you can drop out only if it is contracted with an auxiliary , in this case have ; hence , it is not you that deletes , but rather ' vyou . It will automatically follow that we can not derive *Have seen John lately ? , since you can delete only if have is contracted onto it and deleted also . In English there is a distinction between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and main verb have , as in I have some wool . Stated simply , auxiliary have is followed by a verb ( seen ) and main verb have is followed by a noun phrase ( some wool ) . Now consider the following question , made famous by a nursery rhyme : ( 37 ) Have you any wool ? In our speech ( that is , in the speech of the authors ) this instance of main verb have can not he deleted to form an abbreviated question :  | ( 38 ) *You any wool ? Furthermore , in our speech the main verb have also lacks a contracted form with you . The following type of question is never found : ( 39 ) *'vyou any wool ? This lends further plausibility to the idea that contraction is crucial for deletion : only a contractible verb can be deleted in an abbreviated question . This now leads to a prediction : if for some speakers of English it is possible to contract main verb have , as in ( 39 ) , then for those speakers it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in ( 38 ) . Deletion of Be Continuing our exploration into which auxiliary verbs can be dropped in abbreviated questions , we find the following data indicating that the verb be can be deleted : ( 40 ) a . ( You ) running a fever ? ( = Are you running ... ) b . ( You ) finally rich now ? ( = Are you finally rich ... ) c . Your car in the garage ? ( = Is your car ... ) d . Satisfied ? ( = Are you satisfied ? ) e . John a drug addict or something ? ( = Is John a drug addict ... ) f . ( You ) gon na leave soon ? ( = Are you going to leave soon ? ) g . ( You ) sposta do that ? ( = Are you supposed to ... ) Our data show that deletion of auxiliary be and the subject you is possible , and by now it should not be surprising to note that the subject you can not be deleted unless the auxiliary verb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running a fever ? h. *Are finally rich now ?  | And , once again , the verb in question is a contractible verb . For example , the various forms of be can contract with various subjects : ( 42 ) am I = ' my may are you = ' ryou ryuw is he = ' s he ziy is she = ' s she zsiy is it = ' s it zit is John = ' s John zjan are we = ' r we rwiy are they = ' r they roey As noted in chapter 3 , am shortens and contracts as /m/ , are contracts as In , and is as /z/ , showing that be is a contractible verb and hence can delete . Since the subject you is deleted only if be is contracted onto it , such ungrammatical cases as *Are running a fever ? can never arise . So far , our account of the verb be is completely parallel to our account of do and have . There are some interesting differences , however . Recall the distinction between auxiliary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the verb be : ( 43 ) a . Auxiliary be : You are running a fever . b . Main verb be : The car is in the garage . John is a drug addict . Stated simply , auxiliary be is followed by a verb , whereas main verb be is followed by a nonverb category : noun phrase , prepositional phrase , and so on . But main verb be ? unlike main verb have ? can be deleted in abbreviated questions : cases such as Your car in the garage ? and John a drug addict ? are both possible . This difference between main verb have and main verb be is matched by another difference between them : main verb be has contracted forms ( those listed in ( 42 ) ) , whereas main verb have does not ( recall ( 39 ) ) . Thus , what appears on the surface to be an irregularity ? main verb be can delete , but main verb have can not ? turns out to be a consequence of a regular principle governing the formation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are now in a position to summarize our discussion of abbreviated questions . We have seen that the second person subject ( you ) can be deleted in the formation of abbreviated questions . The auxiliary verbs that can be deleted are the contractible forms of the auxiliaries do , have , and be , and these are the only forms that can delete . The processes involved in the formation of abbreviated questions are summarized in figure 7.1 . Deletion in Declarative Sentences So far , we have examined deletion processes only in questions . For simple declarative statements ( without tag questions ) the deletion possibilities are quite different from those in questions . For example , in declarative statements the auxiliary do appears only when the sentences are negative or emphatic : ( 44 ) a . I do n't know that man . b . You DO know that man . Neither emphatic nor negative do can delete , under any circumstances . And unemphatic positive do never appears : the unemphatic positive sentence is I know that man , with no overt auxiliary . Hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements is simply irrelevant . Deletion of auxiliary have in declarative statements is possible , although some speakers have unclear judgments about have . The situation is variable in our own speech . We find the following deletions of have quite natural when have is followed by been : ( 45 ) a . I been sick lately . ( = I have been ... ) b . You sure been doin ' good work these days . ( = You sure have been ... ) However , we find the following cases unacceptable : ( 46 ) a. *1 gone there many times . ( = I have gone ... b. *1 seen that film . ( 1 have seen ...  | Some dialects of American English accept sentences such as those in ( 46 ) . Hence , even though in questions have can delete quite generally ( for all dialects ) , in declarative statements the deletion of have is more complicated , being variable for speakers in a single dialect and variable across different dialects . AUX SUBJ Do you like your new job ? Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( Deletion ) You like your new job ? D' you like your new job ? You been to town lately ? ' vyou been to town lately ? You running a fever ? ' ryou running a fever ? ( Deletion ) Like your new job ? 0 Been to town lately ? Running a fever ? ( C ) Processes involved in the formation of abbreviated questions . The auxiliary can be either deleted ( arrow 1 ) , producing forms such as those in ( A ) , or contracted onto the subject ( arrow 2 ) , producing forms such as those in ( B ) . Finally , the auxiliary + subject contracted unit can he deleted ( arrow 3 ) , producing forms such as those in ( C ) . The symbol N stands for deletion.  | What about the verb be ? The answer is that for our own style of speech , deletion of be in statements is generally not possible ( but see the exercises for some examples of be-deletion in statements ) . We do not have sentences such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , You running a fever , and so on , in contrast with the pattern cited for Black English . We can summarize the results for our own speech as follows : Deletion and Recoverability of Information We have seen that abbreviated questions are formed by deleting certain elements ( auxiliaries and subjects ) , and we have posited certain rules to characterize these processes . It is important to realize that other apparent abbreviations also occur in the informal style in English . For example , in a situation where we might use the abbreviated question Want some coffee ? , we might also be able to ask , simply , Coffee ? To take another example , suppose you see a friend wearing shoes you have n't seen before . You might point to them and ask , " New ? " These singleword utterances are quite common in casual styles and are perfectly appropriate and comprehensible . The point is that there is no reason whatsoever to suppose that such single-word utterances are derived from whole sentences from which all the other words have been deleted . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressions ( including single words ) , as long as the context ( linguistic or nonlinguistic ) makes it clear what we are talking about . In sharp contrast , the deletion of subjects and contractible verbs in abbreviated questions is governed by a systematic rule , with strict conditions . Not just any kind of deletion of subject and verb is possible , even if the context would make the abbreviation perfectly clear . For example , recall the impossible form in ( 28 ) , *Do want some coffee ? There is nothing incomprehensible about this question : its meaning is clear and nothing in the context of conversation would rule it out . However , the expression has violated a systematic grammatical rule : if the subject has been deleted , the auxiliary must also be deleted . An important point about grammatical piles is that expressions that violate  | those rules are ill-formed and generally can not be rescued , or made good , by appealing to meaning or to pragmatic context . In other words , such rules do not have to have logical or commonsensical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that when grammatical rules are violated , an ill-formed expression results . For these various reasons , then , we say that an abbreviated question such as Want some coffee ? is in fact the result of a systematic deletion rule , whereas expressions such as Coffee ? are not . Notice that the interpretation of abbreviated questions is also highly systematic . For example , a question such as Want some coffee ? is always interpreted as Do you want some coffee ? and not as , say , Do n't you want some coffee ? A question such as Drive your car much ? is interpreted as Do you drive your car much ? and not as , say , Must you drive your car much ? Morphemes such as negative auxiliaries and modal auxiliaries carry important information that would be unrecoverable ? lost ? if they were deleted from abbreviated questions : the resultant abbreviated forms would carry no clue about the presence of these items . It turns out that the formation of abbreviated questions involves reference to a small , highly specific set of elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have , and be . It would appear that native speakers of English , as they learn how to form abbreviated questions , come to learn the specific elements that can be missing from these questions . Given that the set of elements is small , we already know what information to " look for " in interpreting abbreviated questions , and in cases of potential ambiguity the conversational ( or linguistic ) context can resolve the matter . Thus , we have seen two ways in which " recoverability " of information can be guaranteed in cases where deletion is involved : A. By deletion under identity ( as with Tag-controlled Deletion ) , so that elements to be deleted must be identical to other elements that will be " left behind " in the sentence . This means that information about the missing elements will still be encoded in remaining elements . B. By deletion involving a small , and highly specific , set of elements , so that elements that are deleted could only be drawn from that small set . Such mechanisms in natural language allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus to properly interpret expressions in the abbreviated style . Black English in Relation to Other American Dialects  | Returning now to the features of Black English that we discussed earlier , it is important to note that certain features of BE are in fact part of the general set of features for American dialects in the informal style . In particular , it appears that deletion of the verb to be is a property of all dialects in informal style . The difference is that BE allows deletion of to be in declarative sentences as well as abbreviated questions , whereas other dialects limit the deletion of the verb to be to abbreviated questions . Hence , BE has generalized a pattern that other dialects leave incomplete . These results are summarized in table 7.1 . Other features of BE seem distinctive , however ( for instance , recall the use of invariant be in examples such as those given in ( 5 ) ) . Hence , not all the features of BE can be shown to be part of the general features of informal style , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features . Regardless of whether features of BE turn out to be distinct or part of more general features of American dialects , the point to be stressed is that this dialect , and other dialects of American English , are in no way defective or illogical . Table 7.1 Comparison of formal and informal styles with regard to contraction and deletion of the verb be . The informal style sentences in the chart are variations of the formal style sentences at the top . Examples such as You sick ? , spoken with the rising intonation pattern characteristic of questions , shows that deletion of the verb be ( and other auxiliary verbs ) is a feature of all American dialects , not just Black English . However , in Black English deletion of be is allowed in declarative sentences , a possibility not found in other dialects . Thus , Black English actually completes a pattern left incomplete in the informal style of other dialects . Table  | The rules for the abbreviated informal style that we have discussed here not only provide insight into the nature of language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different subfields of linguistics are integrated and unified at a broader level . The rules for the abbreviated style must refer to phonological information : the deletion process is dependent on the phonological process of contraction . Morphological information also plays a crucial role , since only certain kinds of morphemes can be ( phonologically ) contracted and then deleted . For example , only contractible verbs can delete , whereas other types of verbs may not ; and both the information about the part of speech and the information about specific words are types of morphological information . The deletion process itself is a syntactic process , broadly speaking , since it concerns the way sentences are formed in the abbreviated style . Finally , in order to understand sentences that have undergone deletion , we must be able to infer , or recover , the missing information . The pragmatic context in which the abbreviated sentences are actually used plays a crucial role in this inference process , and hence pragmatic information is necessary in our overall account of the abbreviated style . In other words , linguistic explanations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on any single component of the grammar . More often than not , to account for linguistic phenomena we require diverse kinds of information from different components of a grammar . Even though various subfields of linguistics are presented in separate chapters of this book ? reflecting the need to break down the broad questions about language into more manageable ones ? we must not forget that these areas are ultimately integrated when we seek to give complete explanations for linguistic phenomena . We have so far examined the phenomenon of language variation in terms of dialects and styles of American English . In this section we will examine certain additional examples of language variation ( from other languages , as well as from English ) that are of interest to linguists . In our brief survey , we will not attempt to be comprehensive ; rather , we // will focus on a small number of selected examples in order to give a basic idea of some of the significant ways in which forms of language can vary . Lingua Francas , Pidgins , and Creoles For various reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into social contact . When this occurs , a common language must be found , to serve as a medium of communication . Sometimes , by common agreement , a given language ( not necessarily a native language of anyone present ) known to all the participants will be used , and a language used in this fashion is known as a lingua franca . The term lingua franca derives from a trade language of this name used in Mediterranean ports in medieval times , consisting of Italian with elements from French , Spanish , Greek , and Arabic . Until about the eighteenth century , European scholars used Latin as a lingua franca ? a common language for treatises on science and other scholarly subjects . In the contemporary world , English serves as a lingua franca in numerous social and political situations where people require a common language . For example , English has become a lingua franca for international scientific journals and international scientific meetings ? it is , by common agreement , the language in which scientific results are presented . Thus , at a conference of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Chinese scientists , English is very likely to be the lingua franca used for presentation and discussion of scholarly papers . Historically , there has been another kind of situation in which people come into contact , sharing no common language whatever , where one group has been politically and economically dominant over the other . This has been typical of colonial situations , in which the dominant group desires trade with , or colonialization of , the subordinate group . In such situations , pidgin languages ( or pidgins ) have developed , having the following important properties : A. The pidgin has no native speakers , but is used as a medium of communication between people who are native speakers of other languages . B. The pidgin is based on linguistic features of one or more other languages , and is a simplified language with reduced vocabulary and grammatical structure .  | There have been pidgins based on English , French , Dutch , Spanish , Portuguese , Arabic , and Swahili , among others . Pidgin languages are sometimes called contact languages ( reflecting the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact ) or marginal languages ( reflecting the reduced grammar and vocabulary of the pidgin ) . The word pidgin itself is said to derive from the English word business as pronounced in Chinese Pidgin English . Pidgin languages have limited vocabulary ( most often drawn from the " dominant " language ) , and in terms of grammatical features they typically lack inflectional morphemes ( nouns have no endings to indicate plurality , and verbs have no endings to indicate tense or subject agreement ) . In addition , forms of the verb to be are often entirely lacking in pidgins , and prepositions are often limited to a reduced set that serves multiple functions . In an interesting discussion of Hawaiian Pidgin English , Bickerton ( 1981 ) notes that although the vocabulary of the pidgin comes primarily from English , its syntax may vary depending on the original native language of the individual user . For example , Bickerton cites cases such as the following ( 1981 , 11 ) : ( 48 ) a. da pua pipl awl poteito it ( pidgin form ) the poor people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people ate only potatoes . " ( translation ) b. wok had dis pipl ( pidgin form ) work hard these people ( English gloss ) " These people work hard . " ( translation ) Example ( 48a ) is from a Japanese speaker using Hawaiian Pidgin ; note that the verb ( it " eat " ) is final in the sentence , just as it is in Japanese . Example ( 48b ) is from a Filipino user of the pidgin ; note that the verb ( wok " work " ) is initial , just as it is in Philippine languages of the sort this speaker used natively . Although word order in Hawaiian Pidgin is by no means fixed for any given group of speakers , Bickerton notes that the original language of the user of the pidgin is a significant influence on grammatical features of the pidgin . Thus , a pidgin language is not based exclusively on a single language , such as English . It may well have significant features of more than one language . Although pidgin languages are said to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they can he used in highly expres- live ways . Bickerton ( 1981 , 13 ) cites a striking example from Hawaiian Pidgin English , uttered by a retired bus driver : ( 49 ) samtaim gud rod get , samtaim , olsem ben get , enguru " angle " get , no ? enikain seim. olsem hyuman laif , olsem. gud rodu get , enguru get , mauntin get ? no ? awl , enikain , stawmu get , nais dei get ? olsem. enibadi , mi olsem , smawl taim . " Sometimes there 's a good road , sometimes there 's , like , bends , corners , right ? Everything 's like that . Human life 's just like that . There 's good roads , there 's sharp corners , there 's mountains ? right ? All sorts of things , there 's storms , nice days ? it 's like that for everybody , it was for me , too , when I was young . " Although we have not given a word-by-word English gloss of the pidgin , we suggest using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pidgin ( the translation should also give some hints about how to pronounce the pidgin words ) . It is striking to see how a pidgin ? a language with reduced vocabulary and structure ? can be used as a vehicle of serious thought . Certain pidgins have become well established , the most notable case being Tok Pisin , a pidgin widely used in Papua New Guinea . Tok Pisin has a writing system , a literature ( including comic books ) , and even radio programs . As we have already noted , pidgins are generally used by native speakers of other languages as a medium of communication . Under certain circumstances , however , children may learn a pidgin as their first language . When a pidgin begins to acquire native speakers who use it as their primary language , it is referred to as a creole language . Creole languages are said to develop in situations where the adults in a community speak mutually unintelligible native languages and must rely on a pidgin to communicate with each other . As children acquire the pidgin , they probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group . Such situations often arose on slave plantations in the Americas , where Africans from linguistically diverse backgrounds could only communicate in a pidgin . Their descendants began to use the pidgin as a first language , and from this sort of development came such creoles as Haitian Creole , certain forms of Jamaican English , and Gullah ( or Sea Island Creole , spoken by descendants of African slaves living on the Sea Islands ot the coast of Georgia and South Carolina ) . Some scholars believe that current Black English may have had its ori- gins as a creole language ( see Dillard 1972 for discussion ) , but this is by no means a firmly established conclusion . When a pidgin becomes creolized ? that is , when it comes to be used as a primary language of a group of speakers ? it undergoes considerable expansion of its vocabulary and grammar and begins to acquire rules comparable in nature and complexity with the rules of any other human natural language . To take one example , Crowley and Rigsby ( 1979 ) have described an interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Peninsula in Australia . Some typical vocabulary words of this creole are listed in table 7.2 . Among the grammatical features of this creole , common to many other creoles as well , Crowley and Rigsby note a system of marking verb tenses : ( 50 ) a . Im bin ran . " He ran . " ( bin used to mark past ) b . Im ran . " He is running . " c . Im go ran . " He will run . " ( go used to mark future ) Within the noun system , there are mechanisms for distinguishing singular from plural : ( 51 ) a . Wan dog i bin singaut . " A dog was barking . " b . Plenti dog i bin singaut . " Some dogs were barking . " Wan ( originally from the English word one ) is generally equivalent to the indefinite article a in English ; and plenti ( originally from the English word plenty ) is generally equivalent to the English some . Possession is marked with the preposition blong ( from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blong olmaan " the old man 's stick " b. dog blong maan " the man 's dog "  | Some vocabulary words of Cape York Creole . In the Cape York Creole orthography , the vowel i is pronounced 1 ; e is pronounced e ; a is pronounced a ; as is pronounced a ; o is pronounced a , with oo having greater length ; and u is pronounced u . ( See chapter 4 for explanation of phonetic symbols . ) ( From Crowley and Rigsby 1979 , 206-207 . ) Table  | Certain morphemes , known as concord particles , precede the verb of the sentence and agree with the subject . For example , when the subject is a third person noun , the concord particle is i : ( 53 ) a . Dog i singaut . " The dog is barking . " b . Olmaan i kam in . " The old man is coming here . " Concord particles such as i perform the function of " agreement " with the subject , and in this way are very similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffixed to verbs in the present tense ( as in She/he runs versus I , you , we , they run ) . The difference is that concord particles precede the verb , whereas -s is an inflectional suffix on the verb . To sum up , then , grammatical features such as those illustrated in ( 50 ) ? ( 53 ) often come into existence as a creole evolves from a pidgin . This evolutionary process has sometimes been described in terms of a broader " creole continuum " ( Bickerton 1975 ) . In his study of Guyanese Creole , Bickerton noted that between the pure creole ( the basilect ) and the local variety of Standard English ( the acrolect ) , there are a series of mesolects : language varieties that form a continuum beginning at the creole and gradually shifting toward Standard English , each successive mesolect approximating Standard English more closely . Individual speakers can often use a range of mesolects from the continuum and are not necessarily limited to a single mesolect . The evolutionary process of pidginization and creolization is concisely summed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broadest possible terms , many specialists accept a cyclic concept of pidgin/creole evolution . The start is some sort of reduction process in both inner and outer form ( PIDGINIZATION ) ; this leads to a nonstandard linguistic system ( a PIDGIN ) different from any of the ingredients ( SOURCE or SUBSTRATA ) existing previously . The middle stage is achieved by re-expansion ( CREOLIZATION ) to a less-limited linguistic system ( a CREOLE ) . The end of the cycle is a stage in which a standard language exerts influence on the creole ( DECREOLIZATION ) , producing a result that can range up to a regional variety of the standard . What " guides " the process of creolization ? How can children acquiring a pidgin " expand " the pidgin so that it comes to have grammatical structures on a par with those of other human languages ? Some  | scholars have suggested that the increased complexity of the creole reflects an innate " faculty of language " ? that is , a biologically innate linguistic capacity ( see Bickerton 1981 for discussion of a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speakers expanding a pidgin language into a creole are in some intuitive sense constrained by their innate linguistic capacity , and for this reason , perhaps , all creoles have very similar structures regardless of where they have developed . Jargon , Secret Languages , and " Mother-in-Law " Language-Varieties In virtually every recognized profession , a special vocabulary evolves to meet the special needs of the profession . This special , or technical , vocabulary is known as jargon . To take well-known examples , physicians and health professionals use medical jargon ; lawyers use legal jargon ; and linguists use a technical linguistic jargon with vocabulary items such as phoneme , morpheme , transformation , and so on . Jargon is not limited to professional groups , but also exists in what we might term " special-interest " groups . For example , sports enthusiasts , amateur rock-climbers , jazz and rock-and-roll fans , custom car hobbyists , art lovers , and many other groups all make use of technical jargons that are specially suited to the particular interests of the group . The jargon of the criminal underworld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature to an " outsider , " jargon is not intended to be secret , but , for purely practical reasons , particular jargons are largely incomprehensible to those outside the particular profession or group that uses the jargon . For example , the jargon of the computer industry is largely beyond the grasp of the general public , not because it is intended to be secret , but rather because most people can not spend the time , money , and effort required to learn computer science . The shared use of jargon is often the basis for a feeling of group solidarity , with the accompanying feeling that those who do not use the jargon are not part of the " elite " ( see discussion of " slang " below ) . There is , however , another situation similar to that in which jargon is used , where a given variety of language is consciously intended to be secret , with cultural rules determining who is to be allowed to use the secret language and who is to be excluded from using it . Secret language-varieties exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a number of these . One of the most interesting , and most unusual , cases is that described by Hale ( 1971 ) , in a study of the Warlpiri aboriginal culture in Central Australia . All the males of the  | culture undergo certain initiation rituals when they are young adolescents ( roughly around age 13 , shortly after circumcision ) . Part of a boy 's initiation into male society is to learn a secret form of language , spoken only in the context of initiation rituals and only by those involved in the ritual . This language-variety is intended to be kept secret from anyone not involved in the rituals ? that is , from women and children . The secret language is described by its users as an " Upside-Down " language ? that is , the ordinary language turned " upside-down . " The basic rule for the Upside-Down ritual language is this : replace each noun , verb , and pronoun of the ordinary language with an antonym ( a word " opposite " in meaning ) . The actual linguistic data are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the basic idea can be illustrated by using English sentences . For example , in an English version of the Upside-Down ritual language , a sentence such as I am short would be used to mean " You are tall " ; That one is small would be used to mean " This one is big " ; I am thirsty would be used to mean " You are quenched " ; and the sentence He is standing in the sky would be used to mean " I am sitting on the ground . " The idea , then , is that for words of the ordinary language , one must find " opposing " words for the Upside-Down language . For some words , finding an antonym is straightforward , as for polar opposites such as good/bad , large/small , long/short , strong/weak , and so on . For other kinds of words , finding an antonym is not so obvious . For example , how does one determine opposing words for any given plant name or animal name ? As it turns out , pairs such as whistling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms , indicating that with plant and animal names members of a class are opposed to members of the same immediate class . Thus , predatory birds will be contrasted with other predatory birds , eucalyptus trees will be contrasted with other types of eucalyptus trees , and so on . With kinship terms , the oppositions are based on factors such as seniority and generation . For example , the opposite of older brother is younger brother , and the opposite of older sister is younger sister ( these terms , incidentally , are single morphemes in Warlpiri ) . There are also oppositions that are culturally based : fire and water are regarded as opposites . The principles that determine antonymy for the UpsideDown language are quite abstract and reveal a complex and sophisticated semantic classification system ( see Hale 1971 for further discussion ) . Despite the superficial complexity of the Upside-Down language ,  | speakers who have mastered it can apparently use it with great ease and can carry on conversations in rapid speech . The Upside-Down language is used in the context of a special ritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ritual uses of language are open and known to all speakers in a community . For example , in certain parts of the world special forms of language must be ritualistically used in the presence of certain relatives , specifically one 's in-laws . Once again , we will draw our examples from the aboriginal cultures of Australia , not because these are the only cultures with ritual uses of language , but because these are among the best-studied and most interesting cases . As Haviland ( 1979 , 163 ? 164 ) puts it : Aboriginal Australians are celebrated for their highly complex social organization , in which people reckon their relationships to one another largely in terms of kinship . Amidst a complicated calculus of social identities that divided everyone into kin or spouse 's kin , into friends , neighbors and strangers , or into elders and juniors , many groups of these original Australians observed elaborate etiquette , treating some classes of people with extreme respect and caution and enjoying unrestrained and often ribald relations with others . Not surprisingly , this social complexity is mirrored in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haviland goes on to note ( 1979 , 211 ) : Typically , throughout Aboriginal Australia a man was obliged to behave with extreme deference to his wife 's mother or simply to avoid contact with her altogether . Indeed , special forms of language , known as " mother-in-law " language-varieties , would be used by a man when he spoke in the presence of his mother-in-law . One such language is described by Dixon ( 1971 ) , in his study of Dyirbal , an aboriginal language of North Queensland . Speakers of Dyirbal used two distinct forms of the language : one was the " everyday " language , known as Guwal , and the other was the special " mother-in-law " language-variety , known as Dyahjuy . A man and his wife would use everyday language when they were conversing alone , but a man had to use the mother-in-law variety when he was talking within hearing distance of his mother-in-law . The everyday and mother-in-law language-varieties were alike in grammar and pronunciation , but the vocabularies of the two languages were entirely distinct ? they shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the everyday language has a number of names for types of grubs : dvambun " long wood grub , " bugulum " small round bark grub , " mandidYa " milky pine grub , " gid'a " candlenut tree grub , " gaban " acacia tree grub . " The everyday language has no generic term covering all five types of grub . In the mother-in-law language-variety , however , there is only a single general term d'amuy " grub , " corresponding to the five terms of the everyday language . The only way to become more specific in the mother-in-law variety is to use descriptive phrases with the single general term , referring to color , habitat , and behavior of various grubs . As Dixon ( 1971 , 437 ) notes , the mother-inlaw language-variety contains many fewer words than the everyday language ( roughly one-fourth as many ) . The mother-in-law variety is no longer in active use ( having been dropped roughly around 1930 ) , but it is still remembered by older speakers . Along similar lines , Haviland ( 1979 ) describes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian language known as Guugu Yimidhirr , spoken in Cooktown in North Queensland . Among the Guugu Yimidhirr speakers , a man used the brother-in-law variety to speak to his brothers-in-law , father-in-law , and certain other kin . He did not use it with his mother-in-law , because he was never supposed to speak to her at all . As with the mother-in-law languagevariety of Dyirbal , the brother-in-law variety of Guugu Yimidhirr consists of a special set of vocabulary words , distinct from everyday vocabulary words . The size of the brother-in-law vocabulary is relatively small , and again a single term in the brother-in-law languagevariety often corresponds to a number of terms in the everyday language . For example , Haviland ( 1979 , 218 ) cites a number of motion verbs in the everyday language : dhadaa " go , " dhaarmbil " float , sail , drift , " yaalgal " limp , " gaynydyarr " crawl , " biilil " paddle , " and daabal " wade . " Corresponding to all these terms is a single general term in the brother-in-law variety : balil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brother-in-law variety , speakers used descriptive phrases to add distinguishing details . As with the mother-in-law variety of Dyirbal , the brother-in-law variety of Guugu Yimidhirr is now out of use , and remains only in the memory of certain older speakers .  | Language and Sex Roles : Male and Female Speech We have already seen one example in which the language of men and women can differ : the mother-in-law language-variety of Dyirbal was used by a man when speaking in hearing distance of his mother-in-law . As Haviland ( 1979 , 211 ) notes , in Australian aboriginal culture women were apparently not required to use special in-law forms of language , and thus the use of such forms seems limited to men . The distinction between men 's and women 's speech shows up in various ways in languages of the world . Perhaps the most salient examples are those in which men and women use distinct vocabulary words . A well-known study of this phenomenon is that of Haas ( 1944 ) , who examined men 's and women 's speech in Koasati , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a rulegoverned difference between the forms of words used by men and women , illustrated by these data : ( 54 ) Women 's Form Men 's Form lakaw lakaws " he is lifting it " lakawwitak lakawwitaks " let me lift it " mol mols " he is peeling it " i:p i:ps " he is eating it " taclw tacilws " you are singing " As the data indicate , the basic rule is that the men 's forms of the words given above have a final /s/ , whereas the women 's forms do not . The linguistic data are somewhat more complex , in fact , since there are certain circumstances under which the men 's and women 's forms are identical . For example , words ending in a nonnasal vowel and words ending in the affricate /c/ have identical forms for men and women ( thus , words such as isko " he drank " and hi:c " he is looking at it " are used by men and women alike ) . There are some additional minor complications , ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that for a large part of the vocabulary , men and women used distinct forms of the words of the language , and the distinction can be described by a rule governing the presence or absence of a final /s/ . Haas ( 1944 ) notes that members of both sexes were quite familiar with both forms of speech and could use either form :  | Thus if a man is telling a tale he will use women 's forms when quoting a female character ; similarly , if a woman is telling a tale she will use men 's forms when quoting a male character . ( 1944 , 144 ) Thus , men and women used distinct vocabulary forms in ordinary speech , but their shared linguistic knowledge allowed them to speak in the manner of the opposite sex . At the time of Haas 's study ( 1944 ) , only the middle-aged and elderly Koasati women were using the women 's forms , while younger women were using the men 's forms in their speech . In the case of Koasati , there is a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's forms ( governed by the rule for final /s/ ) , but in other languages men 's and women 's vocabulary can be entirely distinct in certain areas . For example , Thai has distinct forms of the first person pronoun for males and females : phom " I " is used by men , and dichan " I " is used by women . In Japanese , there is a general set of first and second person pronouns , used by both men and women : watashi " I " and anata " you . " However , there is a special set of first and second person pronouns used only by men in casual styles : boku " I " and kimi " you . " In general , it is likely that the differences in men 's and women 's speech in the world 's languages involve pronunciation and vocabulary words , rather than strict distinctions in major grammatical constructions of a language . Can we detect any differences between men 's and women 's language in contemporary American English ? The question is complicated by various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out any single linguistic feature of contemporary American English as being restricted to male speakers or female speakers . The distinctions between male and female speech for contemporary American English seems minimal , and are probably best viewed as matters of degree ( for example , female speakers might use certain vocabulary words and grammatical constructions more often than men do , or vice versa ) , rather than matters of strict linguistic convention , as in the case of Koasati or Japanese . ( See Thorne and Henley 1975 for further examples and discussion . ) The topic of male and female speech often raises the question of " sexism " in language . For example , is the English language " sexist " because it has terms such as policeman , fireman , and chairman , where the morpheme man is used in words denoting professions ' ? Is the English language " sexist " because grammar books tell us that he is the " correct " pronoun to use in the following type of sentence ?  | a . When a student arrives , he must register at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can get one here . There is no doubt that the English language reflects certain sexist attitudes ( the male bias in our previous cultural history ) , but the language itself is not intrinsically sexist . For example , policeman can be replaced with police officer , fireman can be replaced with firefighter , and chairman can be replaced with chair . The sentences of ( 55 ) are in fact found primarily in grammar books and hypercorrect forms of English , whereas the following are the most acceptable in natural speech ( see Bodine 1975 for discussion ) : ( 56 ) a . When a student arrives , they must register at once . b . If anyone needs a book , they can get one here . In other words the English language ( like all languages ) is constantly changing , and changes in the language reflect ( among other things ) changes in social attitudes . As this chapter and the next chapter make abundantly clear , there is no such thing as a fixed or unvarying language . If English now has features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that these features can change , and the language will continue to evolve in new ways to reflect the new attitudes and needs of its speakers . Slang and Taboo Language It has been said that slang is something that everyone can recognize but no one can define . Speakers show enormous creativity in their use of slang ( it is , indeed , one of the most creative areas of language use ) , and it is often the source of a good deal of humor . Although a precise definition of slang seems extremely difficult ( if not impossible ) , there are , nevertheless , some salient features of this form of language : A. Slang is part of casual , informal styles of language use . Further , the term slang has traditionally carried a negative connotation : it is often perceived as a " low " or " vulgar " form of language and is deemed to be out of place in formal styles of language . B. Slang , like fashions in clothing or popular music , changes quite rapidly . Slang terms can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ion in a matter of a few years or even months . This rate of turnover is much greater than for other areas of the vocabulary of a language . C. Specific areas of slang are often associated with a particular social group , and hence one can speak of teenage slang , underworld ( criminal ) slang , the slang of the drug culture , and so on . In this respect slang is a kind of jargon , and its use serves as a mark of membership and solidarity within a given social group . To use outdated slang , or to use current slang inappropriately , is to be hopelessly " out of fashion " and excluded from an " in-group . " Slang is sometimes referred to as vernacular ( especially when it is associated with a particular social group ) , and some forms of slang fall under the term colloquialism , referring to informal conversation styles of language . These terms do not carry negative connotations ; however , for convenience we will continue to use the popular term slang . Slang vocabulary often consists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the words turkey and banana are regular vocabulary items in English ( and can be used in formal styles with their literal meaning ) , but in slang they can be used as insults ( referring to stupid or foolish people ) . In addition to the use of regular vocabulary words , however , slang also makes use of regular word formation devices ( of the sort discussed in chapter 3 ) to create new words . For example , new slang words can be coined , as was the case for forms such as diddleysquat ( as in He does n't know diddleysquat meaning " He knows nothing " ) and grody ( as in grody to the max , a phrase made popular by the 1982 hit song " Valley Girl , " with a meaning something like " maximally repulsive " ) . Blends are common in slang , as with forms such as absotively and posilutely ( both words being blends based on the words absolutely and positively ) . Affixes can be used also , as with the slang suffix - ski ( or - sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer " ) , tootski ( " a puff on a marijuana cigarette " ) , and buttinski ( " one who butts in " ) . It is interesting to note that brew and toot ( with the same meanings as brewski and tootski ) are recent slang words that may have been becoming stale or outmoded ; the addition of the slang suffix - ski " rejuvenates " the words . The origin of this slang use of - ski is unknown , but it may be a linguistic parody on Polish or Russian words that end in a similar phonetic sequence . An interesting , and quite amusing , phenomenon in American slang is the use of the forms city and ville to create various compound expressions such as those illustrated in the following examples :  | city a . We 're in fat city . b . What a bummer ! It was , like , depresso city . c . You shoulda seen all the cars ? I mean , lowrider city ! d . She cried all night . . . you know , heartbreak city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the boonies ; I mean , hicksville , you know ? b . What a boring place . . . talk about nowheresville. c . You shoulda seen it : those people were so stoned , it was like drugsville all the way . d . That guy 's really strange ? totally weirdsville . The interpretation of expressions with city and ville is clear enough in specific contexts , but not so easy to explicate in general . Such expressions all seem to refer to situations where some maximum concentration or extreme degree is reached : depresso city means " extremely depressing " ; lowrider city means something like " lowriders modified automobiles everywhere " ; heartbreak city means something like " maximum heartbreak " ; nowheresville means something like " really nowhere " ; weirdsville means something like " very weird . " These are only rough paraphrases , and we leave the finer details to the brave reader . Both city and ville refer to locations , and it is interesting to note that other words denoting locations can be used in similar ways : ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b . He 's in fantasy-land. c . I 'm in chocolate heaven . In any event , although this area of slang is as yet relatively unexplored , it seems that slang " place names " are fairly commonly used in current American English . In addition to individual vocabulary items , and expressions on the pattern of fat city , there are also longer expressions ( with idiomatic meanings ) that are characteristic of slang usage , such as the following examples ( all used in describing someone who appears unintelligent , foolish , or crazy ) :  | a . He 's got a few screws loose . b . She does n't have all her marbles. c . He 's not playing with a full deck . d . Her elevator does n't go all the way to the top . e . He 's running a quart low . These examples contain no grammatical or morphological features that are uniquely slang-related ( such as - ski or ville ) . Rather , their use as insults seems to place them most naturally as slang expressions . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of slang is concerned with name-calling , insults , and generally what might be termed verbal abuse . Speakers are often quite creative in this area . A recent example brought to the attention of the authors involves a car club in the Phoenix ( Arizona ) area , whose members are said to use the word Pluto ( the name of the Walt Disney cartoon dog ) as an insult referring to someone who is stupid , clumsy , and foolish . In addition , something that is stupid or foolish can be called Plutonious , and a person who does something really stupid or foolish can exclaim , I really Pluted out ! Discussion of verbal insults invariably raises the question of obscenity , profanity , " cuss words , " and other forms of taboo language . Taboo words are those that are to be avoided entirely , or at least avoided in " mixed company " or " polite company . " Typical examples involve common swear words such as Damn ! or Shit ! Even though these are heard in mixed company ( both men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still felt to be inappropriate in " polite " or formal contexts . Instead , certain euphemisms ? that is , polite substitutes for taboo words ? can be used , including words such as darn ( a euphemism for damn ) , heck ( a euphemism for hell ) , gee or jeez ( a euphemism for the exclamation Jesus ! ) , and so on . An amusing example is the current expression , the " F " word , which is a euphemism for that notorious English word that many newspapers spell as f  --  - . Euphemisms are often quite indirect and roundabout ways of communicating , especially about things related to bodily functions : if you ask someone , " Where is the bathroom ? " , chances are you are not merely interested in the physical location of a certain room , nor do you necessarily want to take a bath . Euphemisms for words pertaining to death and dying are still common , including such expressions as to pass away or the idiom to kick the bucket .  | Taboo language is not limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , language to be avoided outside the context of sacred ritual . In many societies the language of religious or magical rites can only be used by certain members of the society ( priests or shamans ) . What counts as taboo language is something determined by culture , and not by anything inherent in the language itself . There is nothing inherent in the sounds of the expression Shit ! that makes it " obscene " ? it is simply that in our cultural history the word has come to be known and used as a " swear word . " Foreigners learning English as a second language will at first find nothing unusual about the word , and will not experience the " emotional charge " that often accompanies the use of a taboo word . For Americans learning French , there will be nothing intrinsic in the expression Merde ! ( meaning " Shit ! " ) that will seem obscene . It is interesting to note , however , that bilingual ( or multilingual ) speakers will sometimes avoid words in one language that accidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interlingual word taboos ( Haas 1957 ) can be illustrated in various ways . For example , American students learning Brazilian Portuguese are often embarrassed in learning the word faca , meaning " knife , " since its pronunciation in Portuguese comes uncomfortably close to sounding like the tabooed English word fuck . Haas ( 1957 ) cites a case in which a Creek Indian informant avoided using certain words of the Creek language when whites were around . One of the words was fakki , meaning " soil , earth , clay . " A particularly interesting case cited by Haas ( 1957 ) involved a group of Thai students in the United States , who noticed that the Thai word phrig ( the sequence ph pronounced as an aspirated /p/ , not as /f/ ) , meaning " pepper , " resembled the American English slang word prick . It was necessary to use this word frequently when dining in public , and not wanting Americans to overhear a word that sounded like a tabooed word of English , the students sought another term in Thai that could replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thai word lyre , which , ironically , means " phallus , " but secondarily came to mean " pepper " in the context of their dining out . Thus , the students found a term in Thai that did not sound like a tabooed American slang word ( thus , they could freely talk about pepper with Americans in hearing distance ) ; yet their substitute term had the same meaning as the tabooed English word they were trying to avoid !  | Code-switching and Borrowing The term code-switching refers to a situation in which a speaker uses a mixture of distinct language varieties as discourse proceeds . This occurs quite commonly in everyday speech with regard to levels of style , as , for example , when speakers mix formal and informal styles : ( 61 ) We must not permit the State of California to deplete the water supply of the State of Arizona . Ai n't no way we 're gon na give em that water . The speaker ( in this case an Arizona politician ) is mixing styles for a certain rhetorical effect : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasis to the speaker 's position on the water issue ; and the use of the informal style in this context is intended by the speaker to increase a feeling of solidarity with the audience . Code-switching can often happen within a single sentence ( and at numerous points within a sentence ) . Among the most interesting cases of this sort of code-switching are those in which a speaker mixes distinct ( mutually unintelligible ) languages , a situation that often arises in bilingual or multilingual areas such as the American Southwest . In the following example , Spanish is mixed with English ( the Spanish forms are italicized , with the English glosses in parentheses ) : ( 62 ) It 's now ocho y media ( " eight-thirty " ) on a Saturday night , and we 're gon na hear a new artist con ( " with " ) his new group . You 're in tune with la maquina ritmica ( " the rhythm machine " ) . This example ( taken from a radio broadcast on station KXEW , " Radio Fiesta , " Tucson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mixture of Spanish words . The reverse situation is also common , where a predominantly Spanish utterance has a mixture of English , as in the following example ( where the English word , leak , is italicized ) : ( 63 ) Esta leakiando . " It is leaking . " This sentence , used by a Spanish-speaking mechanic to a fellow Spanish speaker in reference to a leaking radiator , shows an interesting  | morphological pattern in which the verb stem is the English verb leak to which the Spanish progressive ending - ando has been added . In cases of code-switching , the speaker is in effect using two distinct language-varieties at the same time . We can contrast this situation with that of borrowing . When speakers of one language borrow words from another language , the foreign words come to be used as regular vocabulary items and are not code-switching substitutions for regular vocabulary items . For example , when a speaker of English says , " They have a great deal of savoir faire , " we might well recognize that the term savoir-faire was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it has come to be used as a vocabulary item in English ( in fact , it is listed in Webster 's ) . In contrast , the Spanish phrase ocho y media in ( 62 ) is not a borrowed vocabulary item that English speakers now use , but rather is a result of code-switching between English and Spanish . Conclusion In this chapter we have covered several aspects of variation in language . We would like to conclude with the observation that variation , far from being a " defect " of language , actually reveals its true nature : human language is basically a rule-governed system within which an enormous amount of flexibility or creativity is possible . Variation is linguistically neutral , and there is no evidence that the powers of " nonstandard " dialects themselves are weaker than the so-called standard dialect . In other words , variation in language does not entail any inferiority in language . One should not assume that " different is dumber . " Instead the problem is with the attitudes of the language community toward the speakers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various forms of language , thereby elevating some speakers and stigmatizing others to the point where listeners frequently perform on-the-spot assessments of a speaker 's background and abilities based on the selection and pronunciation of a few words ! To repeat , then , the fact that dialects occur readily is a natural consequence of humans using language in a creative manner . The force of variation and change in language is such that differentiation within a language will eventually lead to the formation of different languages , a topic to which we turn in the next chapter .  | Exercises 1 . If you are acquainted with a regional , social , or ethnic dialect , list as many features as you can that distinguish this dialect from the so-called standard language . What are some significant differences in pronunciation , vocabulary words , and syntax ? 2 . The following types of sentences ( originally made famous by Mad Magazine ) are frequently used in the informal style of English : a . What , me worry ? b . What , John get a job ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a raise ? ( Are you joking ? ) d . Him wear a tuxedo ? ( He does n't even own a clean shirt ! ) How would you express each of these sentences in formal English ? Do these informal sentences express any feeling or idea that is not expressed in the formal style ? 3 . Several acquaintances who were raised in Brooklyn inform us that the following sentences are good : a . Let 's you and him fight ? how about it ? b . Let 's you guys shut up , all right ? How does this informal use of let 's differ from its use in formal English ? 4 . In the informal style it is quite common to hear sentences such as the following : a . There 's three cars in the garage . b . There 's a lot of problems with this car . c . There 's many ways to do this . How would these sentences be expressed in formal English , and how do the formal and informal styles differ in the use of there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a style of English that is both colorful and unique . Listen to a variety of sports broadcasts , paying careful attention to the language , and try to characterize as precisely as you can how this language differs from the formal style or standard language . To get started , you might consider the following sample of sportscaster language : " Smith on third . Jones at bat . Mursky winding up for the pitch . " ( This language should be reminiscent of the informal style discussed in this chapter . ) Do n't forget to include differences ( if any ) in pronunciation and vocabulary words , as well as syntax . 6 . In this chapter we considered abbreviated questions of one type , namely , questions without question words ( or wh-words ) such as who , what , where , etc . The following sets of sentences illustrate the differences between wh-questions and the abbreviated questions we examined : ( i ) a . Where have you been lately ? b . Where 've you been lately ? c. *Where 've been lately ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately ? ( ii ) a . Who are you taking to the prom ? b . Who 're you taking to the prom ? c. *Who 're taking to the prom ? d . Who ya takin ' to the prom ? e. *Who takin ' to the prom ? ( iii ) a . What do you want to do ? b . Whattaya wan na do ? c. *Whatta wan na do ? d . Whatcha wan na do ? e. *What want to do ? How do these abbreviated wh-questions differ from the abbreviated questions studied in the chapter ? That is , what are the differences in the rules for forming the two types of abbreviated questions ? In answering , pay careful attention to ( a ) the fact that certain of the examples here are ungrammatical and ( b ) the way contraction works in these cases . 7 . It is not quite true to say that be can never be deleted in declarative statements in the informal speech style of the authors , for the following sentences are good : a . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing you fixed your engine . c . Too bad ( that ) she had to leave town so soon . d . Amazing that he did n't spot that error . What has been deleted from these sentences ? Is this deletion general ?  | LANGUAGE CHANGE 8.1 SOME BACKGROUND CONCEPTS In the last chapter we observed that no language is fixed or unvarying : all languages show considerable linguistic variation at any given point in time . Just as all languages show such internal variation , so too all languages undergo constant change over time . Contemporary speakers of English find the language of Shakespeare 's plays more or less comprehensible , but they can detect numerous differences between the language of Hamlet and the current English language . When Shakespeare used the expression " pigeon-livered " in Hamlet , what might he have meant ? Modern readers will immediately detect here a phrase no longer in use ( although we have a contemporary counterpart in " chicken-livered " ) . In this and countless other ways English has undergone many changes over the centuries ( in section 8.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all human languages change relentlessly and unavoidably . Historical linguistics is the subfield of linguistics that studies language change . Sometimes the term diachronic linguistics is used instead of historical linguistics , as a way of referring to the study of a language ( or languages ) at various points in time and at various historical stages . The term diachronic is often used in contrast to the term synchronic , which refers to the study of a language ( or languages ) at a single point in time , without reference to earlier ( or later ) stages . For example , our study of syntax in chapter 5 is a synchronic study of current American English , but section 8.3 is a brief diachronic study of syntax , that is , a study of the historical development of certain sentence constructions in English .  | In considering the history and development of particular languages , one of the most fascinating questions ? and indeed , a question that has intrigued scholars throughout the ages ? concerns the origin and evolution of language in the human species in general . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What was the nature of the first language(s) ? As with many questions in linguistics , the most fascinating ones are often the very ones we can not answer in any definitive way . Let us see why questions concerning the origin of language have so long resisted efforts to find clear answers . The Origin and Evolution of Human Language Considerable evidence suggests that the capacity for language is a species-specific , biologically innate trait of human beings ( see chapter 11 for a brief discussion of this evidence ) . The question then naturally arises how this capacity may have originated and evolved in the species . Unfortunately , we have little , if any , solid evidence to indicate when language might have originated , why it might have developed in our particular species , and how it evolved from its early stages . Over the centuries there has been endless speculation on these questions , and numerous guesses have been advanced . According to one type of speculation , humans began to mimic the sounds of nature and the cries of animals ( sometimes dubbed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words ( recall section 3.1 of chapter 3 ) such as bow-wow , meow , crash , boom , and so forth , might be taken as evidence of such mimicking . But onomatopoeic words invariably form a very small portion of the words of any given language ; and even if " imitation of nature " accounts for some words , we still have no explanation of how the rest of human language evolved . According to another speculation , vocal language gradually evolved from spontaneous cries of pain , pleasure , or other emotions . Once again , absolutely no evidence has been advanced to show how a fullblown language ? complete with phonology , morphology , and syntax , and so on ? could evolve from simple emotional cries . To this day all humans use response cries of pain , pleasure , and other emotions ; what is left unexplained is why they have language as well . It has been suggested that a gestural language ? that is , a system of hand gestures and signals ? may have preceded vocal language ( see Hewes 1976 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are faced with the  | problem of understanding how gestural language came to be supplanted by vocal language as well as when and why this might have happened . In addition , it is sometimes speculated that human language gradually evolved from the need for humans to communicate with each other in coordinating certain group tasks . The idea here is that people working in groups can cooperate more efficiently if they can use a vocal language to communicate . But such " functional " theories of the origin of language seem quite dubious . For one thing it has never been shown that the carrying out of group tasks requires a vocal language . Why could n't a sign language or gestural language suffice as a communication system in the context of groups at work ? Further , it has never been shown that group tasks require a communication system anywhere near as complicated as human language . For example , wolf packs are extremely efficient hunting groups and yet have no complex language ; further , many farming tasks carried out by humans require no language and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories of the origin of language all suffer from a similar defect : human language is vastly more expressive and more powerful than would be dictated by any given functional task involving groups at work . Of course , once human language did evolve , it came to be exploited fully for all sorts of social functions ; but the needs involved in such functions can not be identified as the cause of language evolution . At the present time the most reasonable suggestion about the origin and evolution of human language is that it was intimately linked with the evolution of the human brain . We know , for example , that over roughly the last 5 million years there has been a striking increase in brain size , ranging from about 400 cc. in our distant hominid ancestors to about 1,400 cc. in modern Homo sapiens ( see Miller 1981 for a useful summary ) . The mere increase in brain size would not necessarily have led to superior intelligence and the evolution of language ? since dolphins , for example , have brains of a size comparable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter 2 ) they have only a rudimentary communication system . Furthermore , even a mere increase in general intelligence might not necessarily have led to the evolution of language . Dolphins and primates , for example , are considered to be more intelligent than birds , yet their communication systems seem to be no more sophisticated or complex than that of birds . Indeed , as Lenneberg ( 1964 ) has pointed out , mentally retarded humans with IQ levels significantly below normal can nevertheless grasp the rudiments of language . Obviously , brain size is only one factor that may have played a role in the  | evolution of language ; changes in the organization and complexity of the brain must also be supposed to have played a crucial role . At what point in time language may have originated is far from clear : guesses range from 50,000 to 100,000 years ago and even earlier , but such figures are speculative at best . In any event it seems likely that language is a relatively recent development in the human species . Given the complexity and uniqueness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous chapters ) , one quite plausible hypothesis is that human language came into being more or less full blown , as the result of a genetic mutation . The crucial problem in determining the answer to questions concerning the origin and evolution of human language is that we have so little solid evidence on which to base any claims . Although attempts have been made to reconstruct the vocal tract of Neanderthal man ( see Lieberman 1975 for discussion ) and to show ( indirectly ) that Neanderthal man had only a limited capacity for speech , these efforts have been somewhat controversial , and we still have no clear evidence whether human language had earlier , more " primitive " stages , and if so , what these " primitive " stages might have been like . In the biological world it is frequently possible to find earlier forms of life existing simultaneously with more evolved forms . For example , the coelacanth was a biologically primitive fish known only in fossil form until a living species was discovered and identified in 1938 . Might it be possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier form of human language ? Small , previously unknown groups of people are indeed discovered from time to time in jungle areas in New Guinea and the Philippines . These groups have apparently been isolated from other humans for long periods of time and have no knowledge of the modern world . Their existence , then , often gives rise to speculation that they may speak a more primitive language that could be an earlier form of modern human languages . But despite the fact that the technology of such people is often at a Stone Age level , their languages appear to be as developed and as complex as any other human language . So far , then , no natural language ( with the possible exception of the pidgin languages discussed in chapter 7 ) has been shown to be more primitive than any other language in terms of grammatical organization , expressiveness , and so forth . Hence , it may seem that we are limited to studying language on the basis of written records that date hack only approximately 6,000 years ,  | in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , however , that because languages change over time , some languages that are now different can be shown to have come from the earlier " parent " language . Not only is it possible to discover the historical developments that a language has undergone , but it is even possible to learn something about the grammatical properties of an original parent language that antedates written records . We now turn to this topic . 8.2 THE RECONSTRUCTION OF INDO-EUROPEAN , THE NATURE OF LANGUAGE CHANGE , AND LANGUAGE FAMILIES OF THE WORLD Similarities among Languages The discovery in the early nineteenth century that modern European languages , such as English , German , French , and so forth , were historically related to the languages of antiquity , such as Latin , Greek , and Sanskrit ( an ancient language of India ) , led to a revolution in our understanding of the nature and history of language . Actually , linguistic similarities among different languages had not gone entirely unnoticed in Europe earlier . Italian and Sanskrit had been compared by Filippo Sassetti as early as the sixteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Persian and German were grammatically similar . A true understanding of the nature of the relationships in question did not come , however , until the early part of the nineteenth century . The person who is credited with the first and clearest statement concerning the relationships among the classical and other ancient languages was Sir William Jones , who wrote in 1786 that The Sanskrit language , whatever be its antiquity , is of a wonderful structure ; more perfect than the Greek , more copious than the Latin . . . yet bearing to both of them a stronger affinity , both in the roots of verbs and in the forms of grammar , than could possibly have been produced by accident ; so strong indeed , that no philologer could examine them all three , without believing them to have sprung from some common source , which , perhaps , no longer exists . There is a similar reason , though not quite so forcible , for supposing that both the Gothic and the Celtic . . . had the same origin with the Sanskrit ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . ( Lehmann 1967 , 15 ) This language , " which no longer exists , " is called Proto-lncloEuropc'nn in the English-speaking world , a term reflecting the ( earlier )  | geographical distribution of the speakers of this language family from India to Europe . Note that if it is possible to learn about an earlier form of a language for which no written records exist , then we may also be able to learn about the history of the world 's languages and perhaps even something about the geographical origin of language itself . How can we learn about this language that no longer exists and for which no written records are available ? In order to see how linguists establish historical relationships among languages and learn about earlier forms of language , consider first the words in ( 1 ) : Table You may know ( or be able to guess ) that these are the words for the numerals one through ten in each of the three languages . You will also notice that languages A and C have some phonological similarities : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a similar ) consonant ; the words for one and eight are the only ones that begin with vowels ; nine of the words have the same number of syllables ; and so forth . Thus , we have some initial evidence that languages A and C ( Spanish and Sanskrit , respectively ) might be related in some way ; but neither of these two seems to be related to language B ( Navajo ) . This brief exercise raises the central questions to be dealt with in this section : ( 1 ) How do we establish with a reasonable degree of certainty that two or more languages are related ? ( 2 ) If languages are related but no longer the same in grammar and vocabulary , how and why did they change ? and ( 3 ) Does language change involve an improvement or a decay in expressive ability ? In attempting to answer these questions , we will be examining some of the most important aspects of historical or comparative linguistics .  | Based on the similarities between Spanish and Sanskrit in the words for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanskrit are related languages ( that they both derive from a common ancestor language ) , in spite of the fact that 2,500 years separate the written records of ancient Sanskrit and Modern Spanish . However , in order to establish a genetic relationship between or among languages ? that is , in order to prove that languages are descended from a common ancestor ? more is needed than the discovery of similarities in sound . In fact , we can contrast the relationship obtaining between Sanskrit and Spanish with two other types of relationships that linguists are bound to encounter . Consider the words in ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . Table The languages in ( 2 ) are Latin ( language A ) and , of course , Modern English ( language B ) . The meanings of the Latin words are the same as those of their English counterparts , although the pairs of words differ somewhat in pronunciation . The languages in ( 3 ) are Scots Gaelic ( language B ) and Northeastern Algonquian ( language A ) . Scots Gaelic is a Celtic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American language of the  | northeastern United States . Based on similarities such as those in ( 3 ) , it has been proposed by Fell ( 1977 ) that the words of the Algonquian language are related to the corresponding words of Scots Gaelic , with the further conclusion that there were European ( Celtic ) settlements in North America more than 2,000 years ago . Below we will take a closer look at this conclusion . Examples ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) illustrate three situations in which languages can share a set of words that are individually similar both in sound and in meaning . These similarities can be the result of a true historical relationship , borrowing , or chance overlap in sound and meaning . We will discuss these three possibilities in reverse order . Chance Overlap in Sound and Meaning The fact that languages often have similarities in sound structure and have words for common objects yields a significant probability that there will be overlaps in sound-meaning correspondences between them . For example , all languages have the /a/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most languages have t , k , and p and the nasal consonants m and n . Moreover , most languages have words referring to water , the numbers , male and female parents , and so forth . In the Lummi language , a Native American language spoken in northwestern Washington State , the word for " father " is /maen/ . In Navajo the word for " mother " is /-ma/ , as in /shi-ma/ " my mother . " Thus , there are a few words in both Navajo and Lummi that are phonetically and semantically similar to words in English , but this is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that either Navajo or Lummi is genetically related to English . Likewise , there is insufficient linguistic evidence that the languages in ( 3 ) , Scots Gaelic and Algonquian , are genetically related . The meanings of the phonologically similar words shared by Scots Gaelic and Algonquian are typical of the type of vocabulary that would suggest a genetic relationship , in that the words generally refer to common objects . The number of words , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systematic sound correspondences of the sort that we will discuss . We must conclude , therefore , that the similarities between Scots Gaelic and Algonquian are due to an accidental overlap in the sound-meaning associations of some of their words . Accidental overlaps must he ruled out when establishing historical relatedness among languages .  | Borrowing Many terms relating to Western technology and culture have become part of the vocabulary of the world 's languages , and English speakers in turn have borrowed many words from other languages . The vocabularies of Modern Japanese and English , for example , share a significant number of common words , such as hibachi , karate , sushi , beer , and computer . This common and shared vocabulary might lead a naive linguist to hypothesize that English and Japanese are somehow related ? perhaps they are descended from a common language ? ( It may be that Japanese and English are in fact descended from a common language , but this is unprovable given our present state of knowledge . ) In establishing genetic relationships among languages , then , one must exclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a common inheritance . Borrowed words tend to be those dealing with categories such as religion , culture , technology , government , and cuisine . Less likely to be borrowed are words for common objects and activities , numerals , and so forth . The Latin words in ( 2 ) were borrowed by English speakers , and although this vocabulary seems to refer to rather common objects , it does reflect the cultural influence of the Roman civilization in England . Having introduced the term genetic relationship to refer to relatedness among languages , we will make explicit what this term means . We will show that for some languages with words that are similar in their sound-meaning association a valid historical connection between the languages can be established . Establishing Historical Relationships The study of language history and the relationships among languages is one of the tasks of comparative linguistics . The traditional procedure that linguists use in determining a true historical ( genetic ) relationship is called the comparative method . Comparative method is not really a term referring to a fixed procedure that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general term covering the analytical techniques linguists employ in reconstructing the history of languages that are hypothesized to be members of the same language family . We will demonstrate some of the aspects of the comparative method by considering a set of words that are phonetically and semantically similar , the similarities suggesting a historical relationship :  | Table Limiting ourselves to the word-initial and - final t of English , we note that this sound corresponds to the d ' s of the other languages . The term correspond used here means that a particular sound occurring in some position in words of one language appears in the same relative position in semantically similar words of the other languages . In the case of the forms in ( 4 ) , we can establish the phonological correspondence set given in ( 5 ) : Whenever extensive correspondence sets of sounds such as the one in ( 5 ) ? which could be greatly expanded , if space permitted ? can be established among groups of words in different languages , a historical phonological relationship among these languages can be inferred because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a . Phonological changes are generally regular ; that is , within the limits of certain conditions , the changes are exceptionless. b . The relationship between sound and meaning in a word is arbitrary . Principle ( 6a ) expresses the fact that speakers of a language can modify their pronunciation in a systematic way . Linguists describe this type of change as the result of the addition of a phonological rule to a speaker 's grammar . In the case of the examples in ( 4 ) , the is in English that correspond to the d ' s in other languages are the result of some speakers ' adding a rule that caused all the original d ' s to change into t ' in their grammars . That the regular correspondence occurs in words that are the same or similar in meaning is crucial also . When different languages have large numbers of phonologically similar words bearing the same or similar meanings , then it is likely that such arbitrary sound-meaning relationships ( principle ( 6b ) ) were inherited by each of them from an historically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to chance .  |  Linguists surmise , then , that Latin , Greek , and Sanskrit have preserved an original d articulation , whereas at some point in the history of English , certain speakers changed the pronunciation of their d ' s to t ' s . English is not the only language that appears to have undergone the change from d to t , however . German , Dutch , and the Scandinavian languages also participated in this change . These languages , including English , are all members of what is called the Germanic language family , and the change of d to t most likely occurred within a single Germanic linguistic community before the community separated into different groups . The Germanic languages , then , share several innovations , such as the change of d to t , that differentiate this group from the other Indo-European languages . Grimm 's Law The set of correspondences given in ( 4 ) is in fact only a part of a larger set of correspondences that can be established between English on the one hand and Latin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underlined portions of the words in ( 7 ) indicate the critical consonants involved in the correspondences . Table As noted earlier , the consonants of Latin and Sanskrit are for the most part closer to what is reconstructed as the original Indo-European pronunciation . It is hypothesized that Sanskrit and Latin preserve the original d , b , and g pronunciation of Proto-Indo-European and that these sounds all became voiceless in Germanic . But not all consonants are preserved in their original form in Sanskrit and Latin , or in any member of the Indo-European language family for that matter . For example , the g in English guest corresponds to the h in Latin hostis . Many linguists have hypothesized that the original Proto-Indo-Euro- pean sound was close to a voiced aspirated velar stop , symbolized *gh . ( An asterisk used with transcriptions indicates here that they are hypothetical forms for which no written records are available . ) Thus , the original Proto-Indo-European *gh became g in Germanic and h in the language that was ultimately to become Latin . We display in ( 8 ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondences represented in ( 7 ) : The changes in ( 8 ) are known collectively as Grimm 's Law , because their systematic law-like character was first stressed by Jacob Grimm ( one of the Brothers Grimm , best known in this country for their collection of German fairy tales ) . There is some controversy over whether Grimm should be credited for discovering this set of " laws , " since the correspondences had already been published by a Dane , Erasmus Rask . Because of his emphasis on their law-like properties , however , Grimm is usually given credit for the discovery . The changes that occurred were indeed law-like , in that all words containing the relevant phonemes underwent the rules , and the changes ? that occurred applied to natural classes of phonemes , in the sense defined in chapter 4 . For example , the class of phonemes that underwent the changes in ( 8b ) is the class of voiceless stops . Thus , after the Germanic languages split off from the other languages , they were subject to a rule that changed all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not important here ) . This rule would presumably have had the following form :  | After rule ( 9 ) had applied , words that formerly had p , t , and k then had j r , and h , respectively . For Germanic children acquiring their language after rule ( 9 ) had changed the consonants , there would be no evidence for the earlier p 's , t 's , and k 's , and they would simply learn the new consonants . Thus , without evidence from other languages , it would be impossible to tell that Germanic f , 0 , and x ( h ) had earlier been p , t , and k . To summarize the thrust of this example , then , we can rephrase the principles in ( 6 ) as ( 10 ) and state the conditions under which languages can be said to be historically related on the basis of their sound systems . ( 10 ) A group of languages is historically ( or genetically ) related if large groups of words can be found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up of phonemes that can be shown to derive from the ( hypothesized ) phonemes of the parent language by the result of regular phonological rules that have applied at some point in the history of each of the languages , and b. the words that are hypothesized to come from a common parent word are the same or are related in meaning . The Indo-European Language Family The languages of the Indo-European family can be shown to be related because the conditions expressed in ( 10 ) are satisfied in sets of shared words . To illustrate how the principles are satisfied , we can begin by considering the words and stems in ( 11 ) . ( 11 ) Table Based on forms such as those given in ( 11 ) , among others , scholars have reconstructed the original Proto-Indo-European forms for " brother " and " bear " to be *bhrater- and *bher- , respectively . Reconstructed forms such as *bhrater are frequently referred to as proto forms . Likewise , a reconstructed " parent " language is often referred to as a proto-language . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the forms in all the descendent ( daughter ) languages can he derived . Thus , starting from reconstructed forms such  | as *bhrater and *bher , each of the daughter languages has undergone its own separate and regular changes from Proto-Indo-European . Some of these changes are given in figure 8.1 . It is important to stress that , when certain conditions are met , all Proto-Indo-European *bh 's change to ph in Greek and b in Germanic . Thus , it is the consistency ( regularity ) of the correspondences among the daughter languages of the Indo-European language family ( due to rule-governed phonological change ) that is decisive in establishing their historical relatedness . Note that none of the descendent languages preserves all of the phonetic features of the hypothesized ( parent ) proto-language for the words under consideration . Sanskrit turns out to be more conservative in terms of the consonants , whereas the other three languages have undergone changes in the consonants , but have maintained the original e vowel . The considerations that lead to positing original *e instead of *a in forms such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the list of references at the end of this chapter includes several books on historical linguistics in which such issues are discussed . Although language reconstruction and the establishment of language relatedness involve many additional complications beyond those discussed here , much has been learned about the Proto-Indo-European language family in the nearly two centuries of research that has been  | devoted to them . Most of the languages in Europe , for example , have been shown to be related to each other historically . We have displayed many of these languages in figure 8.2 . Languages on the same " branch " of the tree in the figure share certain changes not shared by languages on the other branches of the tree . For example , all the Indic languages underwent the change of short e and o to a , and all the Germanic languages shared the Grimm 's Law changes in their consonants . Hence , figure 8.2 reflects a classification system similar to ones used by biologists for plants and animals . Using techniques of reconstruction such as those discussed here , linguists have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many questions remain , however , concerning the original homeland of the Proto-Indo-European speakers and the time at which Proto-Indo-European began to split up . The Indo-European community of speakers had split into very different languages more than 4,500 years ago , so that the original language could not have been a single language fewer than 5,000 to 6,000 years ago . To answer the question of whether this earlier language was more primitive than its descendents , we can state confidently that there is no evidence that Indo-European was in any sense more primitive than the languages that descended from it . Ironically , when the details of Proto-Indo-European were first being worked out , it was commonly believed that the daughter languages were " decayed " versions of the pristine original language . ( The quotation from Sir William Jones at the beginning of this section shows traces of this prejudice . ) However , it simply does not appear that we can gain any important information about the origin of language from the analytical techniques of reconstructing earlier languages . All reconstructed languages appear to be full-fledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have become more expressive or have " improved " in some sense during the past ten thousand years , the most remote time to which we can reconstruct language . Languages of the World Although we can not answer the question of the ultimate origin of human language through analytical techniques such as the comparative method , we can learn about the more recent origins of the world 's languages in that we can show that many languages should he grouped together as members of a larger family . As noted earlier , most of the languages of Europe are members of the Indo-European language family . Among those that are not members are Finnish , Estonian , and  | Hungarian , members of the Finno-Ugric family . The Basque language has not been shown to be related to any other language and is thus termed an isolate . Some scholars have speculated , however , that Basque is distantly related to the Caucasian languages , a group of nonIndo-European languages spoken in the southern USSR . The grouping of other languages of the world into families is much less clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are , so that estimates vary greatly . Part of the problem lies in the differing definitions of dialect , which have a political basis just as often as a linguistic one ( see chapter 7 ) . A commonly cited estimate of the number of the world 's languages varies between four and five thousand , with half of the world 's population speaking Indo-European languages . The large number of speakers of Indo-European languages is due in part to the European settlement of the New World . The individual language with the most speakers is , of course , Mandarin Chinese . The most common second language ? that is , the language learned most frequently as a foreign language ? is currently English . Thus , a Japanese pilot landing in Paris communicates with other planes and the control tower in English . Very few of the world 's languages are unrelated to other spoken languages ; most can be grouped into families . In table 8.1 we list some of the world 's languages , giving an approximate number of speakers for each . Why Languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , concerning how to establish historical relationships among languages , we now turn to the second ? namely , what are the causes and mechanisms of language change ? Surprisingly perhaps , linguists currently have little understanding of the exact causes of language change . For purposes of discussion , we may divide the topic of language change into two areas : individual and community . By individual change we refer to a spontaneous change in a language on the part of a single speaker . Community change we may define as the transmission and ultimate sharing of changes among speakers in a linguistic community . Individual Change One type of individual change that spontaneously occurs is grammar simplification . Modern English has a small class of exceptional nouns in  | Table which the final voiceless fricative must be voiced in the plural form ( for example , leaf versus leaves ) . With respect to the regular Plural Rule of English , this change to a voiced fricative is an exception and represents a complication of the regular process of plural formation . Many speakers of English are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoofs instead of previously used handkerchieves and hooves . Also , with words derived from the exceptional nouns , speakers will form the plural according to the regular rule if the derived word differs significantly in meaning . For example , the National Hockey League team located in Toronto is known as the Toronto Mapleleafs ( not " Mapleleaves " ) . In other words the pressure to simplify and regularize is quite strong , and regularization is probably carried out a great deal in language acquisition by children . Adults may also be a source of change , however , although very little is known at present about the  | possible contribution of adults to language change . We simply do not know why a rule such as Grimm 's Law applied in Germanic , or why in more recent English , rules for flapped and glottal stop variants of t have been added ( recall chapter 4 ) . Once a small group of speakers have changed their grammar , however , the change can then spread to other speakers . Community Change If a change begins in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through time and space as it moves wave-like through a community of speakers . Although some areas tend to be more active in innovating than others , changes will often spread in an overlapping fashion . For example , a difference has been noticed ( Joos 1942 ) in the pronunciation of the word typewriter in two dialects of Canadian English : /tAyprayDor/ and /tnyprnyDar/ . This difference can be explained in terms of the interaction of two rules , the rule for flapped D discussed in chapter 4 and the Vowel Centering Rule illustrated in problem A of exercise 16 , chapter 4 . Vowel Centering applies in some dialects of American English , so that the diphthongs /ay/ and law/ become /Ay/ and /Awl before voiceless consonants . The pronunciation of the word typewriter in the two Canadian dialects can be accounted for by an interesting interaction of the following two rules : Imagine two geographical areas , A and B. In area A , Canadian speakers have rule ( 12a ) in their dialect , but not rule ( 12b ) . In area B , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not rule ( 12a ) . What effect might this have on speakers who are located between these two groups ? How might their pronunciation be influenced by their neighbors in areas A and B ? Suppose that speakers are gradually influenced by neighboring speakers , so that a rule of pronunciation can be said to " move " or " spread " through successive groups of speakers located in close proximity . Given this , it turns out that two rules could originate in different areas , but gradually spread . They would eventually " meet " Geographic spread of two intersecting rules  | and " cross , " creating areas where their effects overlap , as shown in figure 8.3 . Figure 8.3 represents the general geographic spread of two rules . At point X , which is close to area A , rule ( 12a ) " arrives " first ; however , since X is farther away from area B , rule ( 12b ) " arrives " later . In contrast , point Y is closer to area B , the area of rule ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrives " at Y before rule ( 12a ) does . This difference in the order of arrival of the rules yields the difference in the pronunciation of the word typewriter in the two Canadian dialects , as shown in ( 13 ) : ( 13 ) X-dialect Y-dialect taypraytar taypraytar First rule ( 12a ) : tayprayDor First rule ( 12b ) : tnyprnytar Next rule ( 12b ) : tAyprayDor Next rule ( 12a ) : tayprayDar This example gives a good indication of how a change can " move " among dialects . The same type of phenomenon happens also with lexical , morphological , and syntactic change , and thus a widespread language change can take place . If one group of speakers of a language becomes isolated from another group of speakers of the same language , however , each group will undergo its own changes without necessarily spreading them , and after enough time has passed the dialects that have arisen may differ so extensively that one is forced to say that new languages have been created . Spread of Changes among Different Languages An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially phonological ones , can spread between adjacent but different languages . For example , the uvular-r ( an r-like sound pronounced in the uvular region of the vocal tract ( see figure 4.5 , chapter 4 ) ) has been replacing the tongue-tip-r in many of the languages of Europe . Uvular-r is characteristic of French , but it is now common in  | many dialects of German as well ; it is also replacing the tongue-tip-r in dialects of southern Sweden and northern Italy . There is much dispute , however , about where this change started . One of the more remarkable cases of the spread of a phonological change is found in the Native American languages of the northwestern United States . In Washington State , three distinct language groups were geographically adjacent before contact with Europeans . These groups are represented by Makah ( a language of the Wakashan family ) , Quileute ( a language of the Chemakuan family ) , and several members of the Salish language family . The relative geographic locations of these languages are indicated in figure 8.4 , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is the Quileute region , and ( C ) is the Salish language region . What is remarkable about these different languages is that they all lost their nasal consonants by changing them to voiced stops : m became b , n became d , and 13 became g . Although it is not possible to establish in which language the change began , it is noteworthy that this far-reaching change ( indicated by shading in figure 8.4 ) spread throughout these distinct languages . Almost all of the world 's languages have nasal consonants , but these three different languages are among the few exceptions . Notice , though , that the name Makah has a nasal consonant ? thus appearing to contradict the claim that these languages have no nasals . Also , one of the Puget Sound Salish languages ,  | Snohomish , another nasalless language , has two nasals in its name . The solution to this apparent contradiction is that the names Makah and Snohomish were given to these people by neigboring groups that do have nasals in their languages . The Snohomish actually call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b corresponds to m , according to the regular changes mentioned above . Language Change : Decay or Improvement ? We now turn to the third question that was posed earlier : does language change lead to a gain or a loss in expressiveness ? In the past , language change has been viewed variously as decay and as progress , but at present neither of these views seems appropriate or true . Languages seem to maintain a balance in expressiveness and grammatical complexity over time . If a particular grammatical feature is lost ( say , because of a phonological change ) , some feature may be added in another portion of the grammar ( say , in the syntax ) . For example , when English lost most of its inflectional endings ( see section 8.3 ) due , it is often claimed , to the deletion of unstressed final syllables as an effect of phonological rules , it was no longer possible to identify the functional role ( subject or object ) of nouns by their inflectional endings . However , the functional notions of subject and object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nouns , that is , by their position in the linear order of words . In the next section we will discuss the loss of a morphological rule that created causative verbs from adjectives . But speakers of English did not lose the notion of causation when this word-building rule was lost . In fact , we can still say " to cause to be red " or " to cause to be blue . " Thus , the expressive possibilities of a language do not seem to be limited by the lack of an overt grammati. cal structure that carries a particular notion . For example , Chinese has no overt past tense marker , but this does not mean that the Chinese do not have a notion of past time . The idea of past time can be quite clear either from context or from the presence of an adverb that refers to past time . In this section we have referred several times to the changes that occurred between Old and Modern English . These extensive changes are the subject of the next section . 8.3 THE LINGUISTIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive changes between the Old and Modern English periods , although speakers of Modern English are still able to recognize Old English as a relative of Modern English . An example will illustrate this point : ( 14 ) a . Old English In pam tune waeron 13wt Ms and pwt bur paes eorles. b . Modern English In the town were the house and chamber of the chief . In ( 14b ) , a word-for-word Modern English translation of ( 14a ) that ignores some meaning differences , many of the words show a strong similarity to the Old English words . Nevertheless , subsequent grammatical and vocabulary changes have made Old English no longer understandable to the speaker of Modern English . As noted earlier , the English language is part of the Germanic family of languages and is thus historically related to Modern German , Dutch , Swedish , Norwegian , Danish , and Icelandic . The English language began its own separate development in the middle of the fifth century A.D. after a series of invasions of England by Germanic-speaking tribes from what is now northwestern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Frisians , among others . The invaders fought against Celtic-speaking inhabitants who , after fierce battles , were overcome . These were not the first Europeans to invade England and do battle with the Celts , however . The Romans had colonized England during the first century A.D. , before the migrations of the Angles and Saxons began . As the Roman Empire began to collapse , however , the Roman legions withdrew , making possible the conquest of England by the Germanic tribes . The Celtic tribes who spoke Scottish were confined to the north , and the remaining Celtic speakers were pushed into Wales and Cornwall . Of the original Celtic languages spoken in Britain , only Welsh ( still spoken in Wales ) survives . The original Celtic language in Scotland became extinct , although Gaelic speakers from Ireland moved to Scotland in the fifteenth century and there developed their own dialect , Scots Gaelic , which is still spoken today by a small  | population . The Irish Gaelic language is also still spoken in Ireland , but by a minority of its inhabitants . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered a period of relative political stability . The island became covered with a patchwork of kingdoms , and during this period of political stability several dialect areas arose . The major dialects were West Saxon , Kentish , Mercian , and Northumbrian , the West Saxon dialect eventually becoming the most important . The differences among these dialects , which mainly involved pronunciation , were similar to differences among dialects in the present-day United States . The language of this period , called Old English ( or Anglo-Saxon ) , was in many ways grammatically similar to Modern German . For instance , the nouns , adjectives , and verbs were highly inflected , as the examples in ( 15 ) show . ( 15 ) Table The words in ( 15 ) consist of two parts , a base and one of a set of inflectional suffixes . The inflectional morphology of Old English was in fact much more complicated than ( 15 ) indicates . The noun cyning is an example of a so-called masculine noun , but there were two other genders , feminine and neuter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominal genders had different subclasses , associated with different sets of inflectional endings . There were , then , about two dozen different types of inflectional endings that could be added to nouns alone . Since adjectives and verbs were also divided into classes that required different endings , there were altogether dozens of different classes of inflectional endings that were added to Old English words . One of the major changes between Old English and Modern English , then , was obviously the loss of almost all of these nominal , adjectival , and verbal endings ? for the language has very few such suffixes today ( recall the discussion of morphology in chapter 3 ) . In the nouns , only the regular genitive ending - s/- es ( now the possessive ) and the plural ending - s/- es have survived . Plurals such as children carry on an earlier - en plural ending , and plurals such as geese also reflect an earlier class of inflectional ending . ( We will discuss the origin of the stem vowel alternation between goose and geese later . ) The adjective endings have also been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye olde shoppe or in the olden days are relics of them . Another indicator of English language history is found in words spelled with an initial sk- sequence . This sequence , found in words such as sky and skirt , is the result of borrowings from the Scandinavian languages . The Danes , in fact , controlled northeastern England in the ninth and tenth centuries . By far the greatest influence on English from another language , however , came as a result of the Norman Conquest and the victory of William the Conqueror in 1066 . The Normans brought with them the French language , and French remained the Ian- guage of the ruling class for a considerable period . Under its influence the English language changed in terms of vocabulary , phonology , and morphology , as we will see . Although the changes from Old English to Modern English were continuous and gradual , linguists traditionally distinguish three major periods in this development : the Old English period ( fifth to eleventh centuries ) , the Middle English period ( eleventh to fifteenth centuries ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present ) . Scholars studying the history of English are fortunate in that there are written documents spanning more than 1,200 years that enable them to trace many of the changes English has undergone daring this time . These changes are typical of the changes that all languages undergo . In discussing them , we will concentrate on the three structural components of language ? phonology , morphology , and syntax ? as well as on vocabulary changes that have occurred between Old and Modern English . Each of these four components can undergo the three major types of changes : addition , loss , and change in structure . To illustrate how languages change in these ways , we will discuss examples of these changes from the history of English . Lexical Change Addition From Old English times to the present , new words have continuously been added to the English language . Surprisingly , only a few Celtic words have found their way into Modern English , in spite of the fact that English speakers have been continuously in contact with Celtic speakers in Wales , Ireland , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Floyd are Celtic borrowings . By far the greatest number of new words came from French as a result of the Norman invasion . These French words did not always replace Old English words , but in many instances expanded an already existing vocabulary . For example , the words pork , beef , veal , mutton , and venison are all French words referring respectively to the edible meat of the swine , cow , calf , sheep , and deer , the latter being Old English words . Formerly , the Anglo-Saxon words were used to refer to both the meat and the animals . Interestingly , the words beef and cow are descendents of the same common Indo-European word *g " ' how- , which , because of different historical changes in the Germanic and Italic families , has given rise to quite different-sounding words .  | Although English has borrowed most heavily from French , other languages have also contributed words . During the Renaissance , for example , a large number of so-called learned words from Latin and Greek became part of English ( reverberate from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From Spanish we have words such as mesa , lariat , and taco . From Russian we have sputnik and vodka ; from German we have many common words such as kindergarten , hamburger , and gesundheit . Woodchuck is ultimately an Algonquian word , and tomato comes to us from Aztec ( via Spanish ) . English has thus borrowed freely from other languages , a habit that at least partially accounts for its enormous vocabulary . In chapter 3 we also noted the many ways that new words can be introduced into English via abbreviations and word formation rules , producing such words as TV , finalize , laser , and so forth . Consequently , the number of words that can be added to our language ? by borrowing or otherwise ? is in principle unbounded . Loss Conversely , many words have been lost since the Old English period , though a surprising number of the lost words are still present in compounds . One example is OE wer " man . " This word is historically related to the Latin word vir , also meaning " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virile ) have been borrowed into English . The form wer , even though lost as an independent word , still exists in werewolf , which originally meant " man-wolf " or " wolfman . " The OE word rice " realm , kingdom " has a similar history . This word , which was originally borrowed from a Celtic language , has been lost in the modern language . In contrast , the German language , which also borrowed this word , has preserved it in the word Reich . The only relic of this word in Modern English is in the compound word bishopric , which originally meant " bishop 's realm , " a sense close to its present-day meaning . Change Many examples of meaning change have already been discussed in chapter 3 , which focused on narrowing , broadening , and metaphorical extension of meaning . Another example of semantic narrowing that occurred between Old English and Modern English is seen in the word hound ( OE hund ) . This word once referred to any kind of dog , whereas in Modern English the meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clo , , ' ( OE doc ? ga ) , on the other hand , referred in Old   English to the mastiff breed ; its meaning now has been broadened to include any dog . The meaning of dog has also been extended metaphorically in modern casual speech ( slang ) to refer to a particularly unattractive person . Semantic Change and Semantic Fields We have seen examples of individual words undergoing a meaning change . But semantic change at the word level is not limited to single words ? rather , entire groups of words can undergo parallel semantic changes . In her study of semantic fields ( see chapter 3 ) , Lehrer ( 1974 ) has noted that words belonging to the same semantic field undergo similar semantic changes . To take an example ( Lehrer and Battan 1983 ) , consider the following set of words , drawn from the semantic field of bird names : goose , cuckoo , pigeon , coot , turkey . In addition to its literal meaning , each of these words has a metaphorical use indicating " foolishness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goose , cuckoo , and pigeon were the first of this set to be used in the metaphorical sense in question , and all three acquired their metaphorical meaning at roughly the same time ( the first recorded instances dating from the mid-sixteenth century ) . This could be due to coincidence ; but it seems plausible to assume that the simultaneous metaphorical extension of the three words was based on their membership in the same semantic class . Later , the words coot and turkey came to have the same metaphorical use , again underscoring the idea that words in the same semantic field can undergo similar semantic changes . ( The word pigeon , incidentally , had a metaphorical use indicating " cowardice " in Shakespeare 's time ? recall pigeon-livered ? but this use later became obsolete . ) It is also the case that the structure of a semantic field plays a role in semantic change . For example , the words hot and cold are antonyms that describe physical temperature . With pairs of antonyms , if one member undergoes a metaphorical extension , the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as hot and cold are opposites in describing temperature , so they are also opposites in their metaphorical extension in phrases such as hot news ( news that is just breaking ) versus cold news ( news that has become stale ) . In colloquial styles , we can speak of a hot car ( stolen car ) ; hence , we would not be surprised if speakers began using the phrase cold car ( one that is not stolen ) , on the grounds that semantic change tends to affect entire semantic fields in a  | parallel fashion , and not just single members of the field ( for discussion , see Lehrer 1974 ) . Phonological Change Rule Addition There have been many phonological changes between Old English and Modern English , and the rules discussed in chapter 4 ( for example , the rules governing flapped and glottal stop variants of t ) have been added to American English relatively recently . Of course , rules that are added to a language can later be lost as living rules , and only certain effects of the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound changes affecting the long ( tense ) vowels occurred at the end of the Middle English period , and these changes are the cause of one of the major discrepancies between the spelling of Modern English and its current pronunciation . Known as the Great Vowel Shift , this change had the effects shown in figure 8.5 ( where the arrows indicate the direction of the changes ) . The long ( or tense ) mid vowels of Middle English , which we can represent by /e/ and /o/ ( where the bars over the vowels indicate length ) , both were raised and diphthongized to yield the current high vowels /iy/ and /uw/ , respectively . The earlier pronunciation of these long mid vowels is still reflected in the spelling of words such as feet ( once pronounced /fat , now pronounced /fiyt/ ) and mood ( once pronounced /mod/ , now pronounced /muwd/ ) . The high vowels of Middle English , in turn , became diphthongs , the first part of the vowel " mov-  | ing down " to become a low vowel . As part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /ay/ and /u/ became /awl . Again the current orthography reflects the former pronunciation in spellings such as five ( once pronounced /fiv/ , now pronounced /fayv/ ) . Note also the spelling of OE tune for " town " in ( 14 ) , which was the pronunciation before the diphthong was created . Two of the long low vowels , /ae/ and /5/ , were also raised to yield a new set of mid vowels , ley/ and /ow/ , respectively . Thus , Modern English mate /meyt/ was formerly pronounced /mt/ , and the word goat /gowt/ was formerly pronounced /g5t/ . The addition of these phonological rules , then , caused a significant change in the pronunciation of English words , and even though the Great Vowel Shift has now been lost from English as a purely phonological rule , its effects are still revealed in the discrepancy between the pronunciation of Modern English and its spelling system . Rule Loss Early in the history of English a rule called i-Mutation ( or i-Umlaut ) existed that turned back vowels into front vowels when an /i/ or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a certain class of nouns in the ancestor of Old English , the plural was formed not by adding -s , but rather by adding -i . Thus , the plural of gos " goose " was gosi " geese . " Later , when the i-Mutation rule was added , the i-ending of the plural conditioned the change of gOsi to gosi . The ce phoneme is a combination of the o and e phonemes ; it is a mid front vowel like e but has lip rounding like o . Hence , the effect of i-Mutation was to cause back vowels to move forward , but the newly fronted vowels kept the rounding that they had had when they were back vowels . Still later , the lip rounding was lost , and the plural of Os became gee(e) . When gos and ges finally underwent the Great Vowel Shift , the current pronunciations /guws/ and /giys/ resulted . Thus , i-Mutation is an example of a rule that was once present in Old English , but has since dropped out of the language , and thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been altered . Change in Rule Applicability In Old English , fricatives became voiced when they occurred between voiced sounds ( that is , f -* v , H ? * , s ? z ) . Since the most common plural ending was formerly - as , all nouns ending in fricatives underwent this rule in the plural . The rule causing this voicing is no longer present  | in Modern English , but its effects can still be observed in pairs such as singular wife /wayf ) and plural wives /wayvz/ . This change of the stem in the plural is still the result of a rule , but the form of the rule is quite different from the form that it had in Old English . In Old English the rule was phonologically conditioned : it applied whenever fricatives occurred between voiced sounds . In contrast , the alternation between voiced and voiceless fricatives in Modern English is not phonologically conditioned , but morphologically conditioned : the voicing rule applies only to certain words and not to others . Thus , a particular ( and now exceptional ) class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when used in the plural ( for example , wife/wives , knife/knives , hoof/hooves ) . Other nouns , however , do not undergo this process ( for example , proof/proofs ) . Thus , the fricative voicing rule of Old English has changed in status from a phonologically conditioned rule to a morphologically conditioned one . Differences in Phonemic Inventory Addition of Phonemes The phonemic system of Old English was similar to that of Modern English , although several differences can be noted . For example , the voiced labiodental fricative /v/ was not an independent phoneme in Old English . The v 's that did occur were voiced allophonic variants of the phoneme /f/ . As a result of subsequent changes between Old English and Middle English , /v/ has become an independent phoneme . Loss of Phonemes As noted in the previous section , the mutated ( or umlauted ) vowels ce and y ( front rounded vowels ) lost their rounding during the Old English period . The word thimble , for example , probably was originally pronounced as pymbrl in very early Old English . Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suffix - il was used to form nouns with diminutive meaning from other nouns , what can you surmise about the origin of the word thimble ? ) Morphological Change Rule Addition The - able rule discussed in chapter 3 is an example of a rule that has been added to English since the Old English period . As a result of the  | influx of a large number of - able words from French into the English language , English speakers were ( and are still ) able to extract a rule from these words that is productive in current English . Words such as doable and washable have been formed by adding - able to the Germanic roots do and wash . Rule Loss An example of a morphological rule that has been lost is the Causative Verb Formation rule of Old English . At one time causative verbs could be formed by adding the suffix /-yan/ to adjectives . The verb redden meaning " to cause to be or make red " is a carry-over from the time when the Causative Verb Formation rule was present in English , in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier - yan causative suffix . However , the rule adding a suffix such as - en to adjectives to form new verbs has been lost , and thus we can no longer form new causative verbs such as *green-en " to make green " or *blue-en " to make blue . " ( Do you now see how awake ( adjective ) and awaken ( verb ) are related ? ) Rule Change New nouns could be formed in Old English by adding /-ing/ not only to verbs , as in Modern English ( sing + ing = singing ) , but also to a large class of nouns . For example , the word viking was formed by adding /-ing/ to the noun wic " bay . " ( Why might the word for " bay " be used to describe the Vikings ? ) It turns out that the /-ing/ suffix can still be added to a highly restricted class of nouns , carrying the meaning " material used for , " as in such nouns as roofing , carpeting , and flooring . Thus , the rule for creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more restricted in its application , so that a much smaller class of nouns can still have /-ing/ attached . Syntactic Change Rule Addition A syntactic rule that has been added to English since the Old English period is the Particle Movement rule discussed in chapter 5 . Thus , sentence pairs of the type John threw out the fish and John threw the fish out did not occur in Old English .  | Rule Loss A syntactic rule that has been lost from English is the morphosyntactic rule of Adjective Agreement . At one time adjectives had endings that had to agree with the head noun in case , number , and gender . This rule is no longer found in English , since for the most part these inflectional endings have been lost . Syntactic Change : Auxiliary Verbs versus Main Verbs Recall from chapter 5 that contemporary English makes a distinction between auxiliary verbs and main verbs , a distinction reflected in questions ( only auxiliary verbs can be fronted in questions , as in Can you leave ? ) , negative sentences ( only auxiliary verbs can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't leave ) , and tag questions ( only auxiliary verbs can appear in tags , as in You can leave , ca n't you ? ) . Focusing now only on so-called modal verbs ( can , could ) , it is interesting to note that prior to the sixteenth century these syntactic distinctions between main verbs and auxiliary verbs did not exist . At that time it was possible for main verbs to take not , and examples such as the following can be found in Shakespeare 's writings : ( 16 ) a . I deny it not . ( " I do n't deny it . " ) b . Forbid him not . ( " Do not forbid him . " ) Similarly , main verbs could be fronted in forming questions : ( 17 ) a . Revolt our subjects ? ( " Do our subjects revolt ? " ) b . Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade ? ( " Does the hawthorn-bush not give a sweeter shade ? " ) However , by Shakespeare 's time such patterns were already beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mid-1500s ( see Lightfoot 1979 for a summary and discussion ) . After the sixteenth century the grammar of English had changed so that auxiliary verbs ? and never main verbs ? had to be used in negation , questions , and other patterns we have noted . The changes that took place between Old English and Modern English are typical of the kinds of changes that all human languages undergo over time , and after enough years have passed the descendent language ( or languages ) can be very different from its ( their ) ancestor language . Moreover , language change offers important indirect evi- dence about the nature of human language ? namely , that it is rulegoverned . We have seen that the major changes that the English language underwent between the Old English and Modern English periods are best viewed as changes in the sets of rules characterizing the two stages of English . Over time , grammatical rules can be added , lost , or changed ; so language has always changed , and it will continue to change . 8.4 THE GRAPHIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be represented as a sequence of discrete symbols standing for individual speech sounds was not known to the people who first attempted to represent speech graphically . Because writing systems have existed for only about 6,000 years , and because some of the earliest written records have been preserved , it is possible to follow the developments that eventually led to the modern alphabet . Systematic writing developed in the Near East and was originally pictographic or ideographic . Pictographs represent objects and are thus iconic , whereas ideographs represent ideas or sets of related ideas and are thus symbolic . For example , a circle 0 used as an ideograph might represent the sun , summer , light , heat , and so forth . What is crucial is that this type of writing system did not represent either individual words or the sounds making up the words . When the individual symbols come to be associated with certain words in a standardized fashion , the writing system is said to be logographic . A logographic writing system is today in use in China . For the most part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words and do not have a consistent or fixed sound value ( see figure 8.6 ) . This lack of a sound-meaning association has an advantage in China because there exist so many different dialects of spoken Chinese . Mandarin , a form of Chinese spoken in the north , and Cantonese , a form spoken in the south , are for the most part mutually unintelligible . But since Mandarin speakers associate the Mandarin words ( pronunciations ) with the individual characters that stand for them , whereas Cantonese speakers associate the Cantonese words ( pronunciations ) with these same characters , Mandarin and Cantonese speakers can communicate via their common writing system ( which functions as a lingua franca ; see chapter 7 ) . European languages share some logographic symbols , the Arabic numerals being perhaps the most common example . For the numbers 3 ,  | 4 , and 5 , for example , French speakers say trois , quatre , cinq , German speakers drei , vier , fiinf , and English speakers three , four , five . An extension of the logographic system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be associated with the sound ( pronunciation ) of that word and is used to represent other words that contain the same sound . We can illustrate this type of writing with an example from English . Noting that the symbol 4 is pronounced /for/ , we can use this symbol to represent the preposition for in the expression 4 me for me . " It can even be used to form part of a longer word , as in 4-ground " foreground . " This type of writing is found in Egyptian hieroglyphics and is still used today in the type of children 's puzzle called the rebus . As soon as symbols became associated with sounds , new possibilities for representing language became available . A common writing system , one that many languages still use , is syllabic writing . The earliest writing of this type is called cuneiform ( from Latin cuneus " wedge " ) . The name reflects the fact that a wedge-shaped stylus was used to make marks on soft clay tablets that were later dried or even baked in kilns . The cuneiform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ultimately came to represent combinations of sounds and in some cases single sounds . The Sumerians first developed this writing system more than 5,000 years ago , and it soon spread to other people such as the Babylonians and Akkadians , who used these symbols to write their own languages . Some early writing systems of Semitic ( the language family that includes Arabic and Hebrew ) were basically syllabic , but they did not represent the vowels ( Sch sntncs cn stll b ndrstd ) . Egyptian hieroglyphics are also basically syllabic even though they appear to be ideographic or even pictographic . A Frenchman , Jean Francois Champollion , is credited with the earliest comprehensive decipherment of these Egyptian symbols . Using the Rosetta stone , on which a bilingual inscription in Greek and two forms of Egyptian writing , hieroglyphic and demotic , were found , Champollion discovered that the hieroglyphics represented sounds ( see figure 8.8 ) . Hieroglyphics are a very ornate writing system that eventually became limited to use in writing religious inscriptions on monuments . For common religious writing , a script called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hieroglyphics . The hieratic script was better suited for writing quickly with pen on papyrus . The hieratic script remained in general use for religious writing , and from it an even simpler form , demotic , was developed for everyday use . Examples of the three writing systems are given in figure 8.9.
