As the Royals won the World Series for the first time last night with an 11-0 victory , their manager relaxed as much as a manager could . Through the tension of six taut games , Dick Howser was hounded by the second-guessers who analyzed his every thought . Sometimes even a thought he never had until a second-guesser brought it up . But he always smiled // " Low-scoring , close games are never easy on anybody , " the Royals ' manager said after Game 6 Saturday night . " Except second-guessers. " // After the Royals disposed of John Tudor , the Cardinals ' ace left-hander , for a 5-0 lead in the third inning last night , Dick Howser had a chance to relax . But he didn ' t surrender to the temptation until Bret Saberhagen , his 21-year-old right-hander , maintained his shutout in the fourth inning. // " That ' s when I started to feel good , " the Royals ' manager acknowledged . " Shutting them down in the next inning after you get a lead , not letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key. " // And so the Royals finally joined baseball ' s royalty , with Dick Howser enjoying his coronation as a winning World Series manager in his first attempt . When the Royals lost the first two games of the American League championship series , his postseason record was 0-11 . But since then it ' s 8-4 , prompting a second-guesser to tell Dick Howser that he had gone from goat to hero. // " No , I ' ve never been a goat and I ' ll never be a hero , " he said firmly . " To me , ' goat ' is a harsh word . I don ' t own a farm , I don ' t know what a goat is . And to me , a hero is somebody who ' s a war hero . I hope we never get in a war so I don ' t have to prove myself that way. " // For this 49-year-old manager with the little-boy looks , the timing was perfect . His coronation as a winning World Series manager occurred only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had after the 1980 American League championship series when George Steinbrenner decided that Dick Howser could not ignore the opportunity to be a Florida real estate entrepreneur. // Midway through the following season , Dick Howser spurned that real estate " opportunity " to return to baseball as the Royals ' manager. // The Yankees , meanwhile , have changed managers almost every time George Steinbrenner checks the American League East standings . Lou Piniella was knighted yesterday as their latest dugout genius while Billy Martin was discarded - again. // In the Royals ' dugout , meanwhile , Dick Howser , the manager George Steinbrenner never should have dismissed , was alive and well as never before. // When the Yankees were swept by , ironically , the Royals in the 1980 American League championship series , George Steinbrenner forgot that Dick Howser ' s team had won 103 games that season . The principal owner applied the ultimate second-guess - changing managers . Despite his beheading , Dick Howser never griped , never whimpered .

Just as he led the Royals to their World Series triumph like the man he is. // " To put it mildly , " he was saying now , " we never did anything easy from the regular season to the playoffs to the World Series .

I ' m not talking about a rah-rah kind of confidence . You could just see it in their eyes that they thought they could win. " // If a manager is to be blamed when his team folds , he must be credited when it rallies . No manager ' s team ever accomplished so much the hard way . Back in July , the Royals were seven and a half games behind the California Angels in the American League West , but they rallied to win the division .

In the World Series , they were behind , three games to one , but they rallied to win it. // In the confusion , the Royals also achieved what no other World Series champion ever had - winning the Series after having lost the first two games in their own ball park. // In the embarrassment of their loss , the Cardinals departed with ruffled feathers and a slashed talon . During the Royals ' six-run sixth inning that built their lead to 11-0 , both Whitey Herzog and Joaquin Andujar , the Cardinals ' right-hander , were ejected by Don Denkinger , the home plate umpire . Denkinger had been among the American League arbiters branded by the Cardinals ' manager Saturday night as " prejudiced " against the National League champions. // Upon arriving in the Cardinal dugout after his third-inning removal , John Tudor had swung at an electric fan , slicing his left forefinger . He required several stitches for what he called a " foolish " mistake. // " He didn ' t have his control , he couldn ' t get his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who suffered his earliest departure this year . " But we should ' ve put it away Saturday night. " // Over the seven games , the Royals ' pitchers limited the Cardinals to a total of only 13 runs . Dick Howser talked about how other major league teams now will try to develop a staff at the Royals ' level , but Whitey Herzog didn ' t gush over the Royals ' pitchers. // " They had a good staff , but not that good , " the Cardinals ' manager said . " If they were that good , they would ' ve won 135 games this year. " // After leaving the Cardinal clubhouse , Whitey Herzog walked into the Royals ' clubhouse that he once ruled as their manager . He hurried into the manager ' s office , shook hands with Dick Howser , saying , " You did a helluva job . " Then he embraced John Schuerholz , the Royals ' general manager. // " Will you tell Mr. K , " he said , referring to Ewing Kauffman , the Royals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // With that , Whitey Herzog departed . At his desk , Dick Howser was explaining how the Royals began moving two months ago when " Hal McRae started hitting fourth full-time and Steve Balboni hit some big home runs . " But the Royals had won the World Series without Hal McRae , their designated hitter , and without Steve Balboni slugging any home runs . Why ? George Brett had the obvious answer as he hugged Dick Howser. // " You , " the Royals ' third baseman said , " are the best manager there is. " // And the best manager George Steinbrenner ever dismissed. //
