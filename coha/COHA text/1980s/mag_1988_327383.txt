And TIME 's Man of the Year for 1988 is . . . <P> Sorry about that , but you will have to wait until next week 's issue to read all about our choice for the newsmaker who most dominated events over the past twelve months . But , thanks to Cable News Network , you can find out who it is before next Monday . <P> On Dec. 24 at 4:30 p.m . EST , the news will be broken , when the Atlanta- based network airs CNN Presents the TIME Man of the Year , with anchor Mary Anne Loughlin and correspondent Mark Walton as co-hosts . The 30-minute program , produced in association with TIME , will explain how the selection was made and offer an in-depth profile . " It was a unique challenge to translate something that is essentially a print story into a visual and dynamic television presentation , " says David McGowan , TIME 's special-projects director , who assisted CNN 's effort . " CNN 's life was not made any easier by the fact that it had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producer Stacy Jolna and his eight-person team began shooting in early December , shortly after TIME made its pick . " To us , TIME 's choice of Man of the Year is a compelling news story in its own right , " says Jolna . " By the end of the first week , we had knocked off a dozen interviews and had begun amassing file footage that would help tell the story of the Man of the Year visually . " Altogether , CNN shot 40 hours of videotape and planned to be editing the program right up to airtime . <P> To keep TIME 's choice under tight wraps , we swore Jolna and the members of his unit to secrecy . They quietly came and went from an unmarked office two floors above the bustling CNN newsroom that was cryptically known around the network as Edit Booth X. " Occasionally , CNN colleagues not involved with the program would ask me to whisper who it was , " Jolna says , smiling . " I would mutter that it was a sports figure , or something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> The scratching can stop when the program airs this Saturday , a video curtain raiser to the full show between our covers , which will be in your hands a few days afterward.
