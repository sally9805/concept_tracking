Lebanese violence and Israeli inflation take their toll <P> The suicidal attacks may capture the most attention , but it is the unremitting bursts of daily violence that make Lebanon the terrifying place it is : the car bombing here , the firefight there . Sometimes what is most surprising is that the savagery does not claim even more victims . When six explosions ripped through a cluster of stores in West Beirut last week , one person was killed and three were wounded ; had the bombs not gone off shortly after the 8 p.m. curfew , when the streets were deserted , the toll could have been much higher . The terrorists , as usual , were unknown . Shi'ite fundamentalists were the prime suspects , since most of the shops were owned by Christians , but the bombers might also have been Christian extremists or even thugs trying to shake down the merchants . <P> The bombings were almost anticlimactic . Earlier in the week , Lebanese Army units had battled Shi'ite militiamen for control of positions near the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee camps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berri , leader of Amal , the main Shi'ite militia group , agreed to let government troops take over the sites , the Lebanese soldiers moved in with guns blazing . By the time an uneasy truce had settled over the area , officials estimated , the death toll was 50 ; unofficially the total was put as high as 200 . <P> Meanwhile , two Israeli soldiers died in guerrilla ambushes in southern Lebanon . Israeli Chief of Staff Lieut . General Moshe Levy blamed Palestinian fighters for the attacks . But the gunmen might also have been local Shi'ites , whose poor relations with the Israeli occupiers have steadily worsened since September , when Jerusalem redeployed its troops 17 miles south of Beirut . Since then , 39 Israelis have fallen victim to violence in southern Lebanon . Several weeks ago , the Israelis talked about pulling back ten to 15 more miles , to the Zahrani River , but U.S. officials persuaded them to delay the move at Lebanese President Amin Gemayel 's request . Nonetheless , over the weekend the Israelis did go so far as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was also preoccupied with his country 's deteriorating economy . Squeezed be tween a record 1983 inflation rate of 200% and a sluggish pace in cost of living pay raises , Israelis are staging impromptu strikes . The country 's 4,500 postal workers stayed away from their jobs for three days last week , while 800 Interior Ministry employees walked out on Thursday . <P> Shamir 's problems grew worse when word leaked out that Finance Minister Yigal Cohen-Orgad 's new austerity program included a freeze on settlement construction in the West Bank . The government spends an estimated $700 million a year , not counting defense costs , on the occupied region . Cohen-Orgad 's proposal immediately brought protests from right-wingers , who regard the settlement program as insurance that the West Bank will remain in Israeli hands . Indeed , the Techiya Party , whose support is necessary if Shamir 's coalition is to retain its slim four-seat majority , threatened to bolt if the settlement budget was cut .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
