South Africa digs in confidently , with no end in sight <P> Radio and television messages to the boys at the front . Small-town burials of flag-draped coffins . Posthumous awards for valor . These are daily reminders of South Africa ' s seemingly endless , distant bush war , which has droned on for 14 years . The battleground is Namibia ( South West Africa ) , which South Africa has controlled since 1920 . A flurry of hope for a negotiated cease-fire was shattered in Geneva last month when a United Nations conference on Namibia 's future broke down . Reason : South Africa refused to risk an independent government led by the Marxist-oriented South West Africa People 's Organization ( SWAPO ) . Since then , the South African army claims that its counterinsurgency campaign has gained the upper hand . But not even the most optimistic South African officer sees any real end to the no-win war . Johannesburg Bureau Chief Marsh Clark and TIME 's Peter Hawthorne visited the war zone near Namibia 's Angolan border . Their report : <P> The South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " win the hearts and minds " of the Namibian people . The claim is a sardonic reminder of Viet Nam , and , indeed , the parallels in this war do not stop there . The 20,000 troops of the South African Defense Force ( SADF ) vastly outnumber the 8,000-odd SWAPO guerrillas . The SWAPO forces , armed with Soviet-made rifles and light artillery , are no match for the mechanized , often airborne South African troops . And , like the Cambodia-based Viet Cong a decade ago , SWAPO conducts its raids from sanctuaries-this time in neighboring Angola . <P> The war , conducted mostly in sporadic , hit-and-run raids by both sides , is focused on the northern area of Ovamboland . This flat bush country near the Angolan border offers SWAPO good cover and a minimum of geographical obstacles . In other sectors , the current rainy season and swollen rivers have slowed down both sides . The rains wash away SWAPO supply routes . At a camp in the Caprivi Strip , one South African company commander complained : " I 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that flooded last night . I 'm going to have to extract them by air . " <P> Like most of the guerrillas , 46% of the population belongs to the Ovambo tribe . In addition , most of Namibia 's 1 million inhabitants are clustered within 20 miles of the long Angolan border . Thus it is exceedingly difficult for South African troops to distinguish enemy guerrillas from the local populace . Yet on paper , the South Africans seem to have the war under control . Their claimed " kill ratio " over the past two years : a phenomenal 3,343 SWAPO dead compared with 72 South Africans . Such lopsided figures are vigorously disputed by SWAPO . <P> South African officers , however , admit that they can not continue to hold their own without the organized support of the local population . Accordingly , since last year they have assigned troopers to civilian duties , ranging from teaching to livestock breeding . And they have mounted a strong effort to recruit local cadre men for military and paramilitary operations . The aim : a Pretoria-controlled South West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each comprising 800 to 1,000 indigenous recruits . At least four such outfits already exist ( see box ) .
