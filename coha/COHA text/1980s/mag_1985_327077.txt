In the complex and contentious world of arms control , the question of the hour , and of some years to come , is about Star Wars . What does Ronald Reagan 's ambitious plan for space-based antimissile defenses mean for the future of the arms race and attempts to regulate it ? <P> That question was very much on Andrei Gromyko 's mind in Geneva last week . George Shultz , who prides himself on being a straight talker , was in the awkward position of having to hedge and dodge . A Soviet official said after the meeting , " Whenever our side tried to learn about the specifics of the American space-arms program , Mr. Shultz tried to answer us with vague generalities and rather unhelpful lectures . " <P> Shultz , quite simply , was not authorized to be more " helpful . " Neither his negotiating instructions nor the existing American consensus on foreign policy provided him with the basis for a clear answer about what the Strategic Defense Initiative is really supposed to be , whether it should figure in arms- control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the problem is that Reagan 's idea of the program differs significantly from that of many others in his Administration . When the President delivered his startling speech on March 23 , 1983 , unveiling his hope that the U.S. might some day be able to protect itself from enemy attack , he profoundly changed the terms of reference in the national , and international , debate over nuclear war and peace . <P> He was suggesting that we no longer resign ourselves to the existence of 50,000 nuclear charges in the superpowers ' arsenals and the perverse confidence that a balance of terror will prevent any of them from ever going off . The President imagined a time when those weapons could be rendered " impotent and obsolete " by deploying an array of kinetic-energy projectiles , lasers , directed particle beams or other exotic devices that would prevent enemy warheads from ever reaching their targets . No more threat of intercontinental mass homicide , no more superpower suicide pact , no more Mutual Assured Destruction . In place of that MADness would be pure protection : a defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy weapons , not people . <P> Reagan called that goal a vision . His critics called it a mirage . Physicists have questioned whether Reagan 's ray guns would ever work adequately ; even a relatively small " leakage " through the defensive umbrella would rain down horrendous destruction . Military specialists have pointed out that there is a variety of ways the Soviets could slip weapons through even the most sophisticated , multilayered space-based defenses . Economists and politicians are aghast at the eventual total cost ( some estimates range from $500 billion to a cool trillion ) . <P> Almost everyone worries about the possible Soviet response . What happens when the Evil Empire strikes back with a Star Wars program of its own ? Surely the Kremlin will not sit back and wait for the U.S. to share its technological breakthroughs , as Reagan has offered . Nor are the Soviets likely to rely solely , or even mainly , on their shields ; rather they will continue to amass nuclear spears . The result could be the worst of all possible worlds , one that combines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
