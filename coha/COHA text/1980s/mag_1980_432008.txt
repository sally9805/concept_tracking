 | KABUL , AUGUST 1967 . Music blares , bright lights and fireworks flare as Afghanistan celebrates 48 years of peaceful independence . Yet the winds of cold war already blow from the north : Soviet-made tanks and rocket launchers rumble along Akbar Khan Street , and MIGs scream overhead to highlight the military parade . To an army brigadier I express my surprise . How could his nation , traditionally neutral , trust its colossal northern neighbor to train and equip its armed forces ? His reply is beautifully Afghan : " When you ride a good horse , do you care in which country it was born ? " Qandahar , March 1980 . Aloft somewhere over Afghanistan 's Dasht-e Margow , the Desert of Death , we throttled back and buckled up for the descent into Qandahar , the southern Afghan city where I would spend the night . Authorities at Tehran 's airport had refused to let the plane wait there any longer , and our destination , Kabul , on the edge of the Hindu Kush , was still closed by blizzards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the Turk with a diplomatic passport , the striking lady from Lisbon , two Pushtun tribesmen in robes and turbans , a strung-out German hippie , the bald Lebanese always taking notes , and an American reporter revisiting a dozen familiar cities caught up in the wrenching turmoil of 1980 . I had earlier inquired of our pilot , sipping coffee at the galley , after an old friend who also flew for the Afghan airline . " He 's dead , " he said sadly . " They shot him in front of his house . " " They , " of course , meant the Soviet-supported regimes that have ruled the country since 1978 . Among the thousands who died in the ensuing tumult was U. S. Ambassador Adolph Dubs . Last December Afghanistan 's revolutionary president Hafizullah Amin , suspected of making overtures to the West , was assassinated , and the Red Army , 80,000 strong , poured across the border . Armies and borders are the oldest of all stories in the Middle East , that crossroads where three continents meet . The region , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with big-power attention focused on Southeast Asia and later Africa . Now the nations between Morocco and Pakistan provided a new chessboard @#  | on a grand scale . And again the lives of the people across a vast area were being influenced by decisions made elsewhere . We touched down on a long runway built with U. S. aid but now guarded by Soviet tanks and antiaircraft missiles . We taxied to the terminal past rows of dartlike MIG-19s and MIG-23s slung with rockets 64 jets in all , poised only 650 miles from Persian Gulf shipping lanes . Bused from the airstrip into Qandahar , I found only a handful of greengrocers halfheartedly selling tangerines and apples from pushcarts . A few local taxis , three-wheeled Vespa scooters embellished with mottoes from the Koran , huddled near the hotel . Otherwise , merchants protesting the Soviet occupation had shuttered the city tight . " It is a tragedy . Afghanistan will never be the same , " one of my fellow passengers , a Kabul man in a business suit , volunteered in a guarded voice as we warmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Praise God , I got my family out . As soon as I settle my affairs , I will leave too . " When our flight finally reached Kabul next day , turbaned street crews were digging out from under two feet of snow with crude wooden shovels . Wraiths of steam billowed from trucks and armored cars marshaling along the road to Charikar . I looked up a high official in the Foreign Ministry , a longtime friend who had spent 20 months in prison following the 1978 coup . " These are difficult times , even painful , and they will not end soon , " he said . " But this is not the first crisis wished on our nation by outside forces . We must persevere . Afghanistan will survive . " My driver , a rough-hewn Hazara from the rugged Hindu Kush , best summed up the fears of his deeply religious countrymen . " Look what happened to our brothers north of the border . Their mothers were Muslims , their fathers were Muslims ? but the young men have all been brought up kafirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here I found another major change between the Middle East I had known and the one that now confronted me . ( See the special supplement map of the Middle East distributed with this issue . ) As the Western powers lost first their colonies , then their influence in the area , Muslim leaders moved 338 @# gradually to fill power vacuums , sparking an international resurgence of Islam . Only under the Russians and the Israelis has Islam waned . Now one of these religious leaders ? Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ? has overturned a government , and others exert potent political influence in places like Saudi Arabia , Egypt , and Libya . TASHKENT , SOVIET CENTRAL ASIA , 1971 . I am impressed by the many ambitious Soviet development projects : electric buses , the large university , parks , a building boom . Still , many of life 's basics are missing . Shoppers wait in long lines , only to find store shelves nearly bare ; travel requires a government permit ; bookstores are stocked mainly with bound volumes of Lenin 's speeches . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Uzbek faces one met in the Kabul bazaar ? never smile . Despite the U.S.S.R. 's official atheist policies , I found many there seeking comfort in their Islamic culture and religion . In Samarkand , 14th-century capital of the conqueror Tamerlane , I joined crowds at the splendid azure-tiled shrines of Shah-iZinda . Trees were festooned with strips of white cloth , prayer offerings left by the faithful visiting a tomb believed to hold a cousin of the Prophet . Such local pilgrimages are popular . Last year , of the Soviet Union 's 40 million Muslims , only 25 were allowed to visit distant Mecca . At one mausoleum a long-robed Uzbek villager and his son watched me with curiosity while I copied an elegant Arabic inscription into my notebook . " Tarif al-lughah al-arabiyah ? " the old man ventured in the Arabic of the Koran . " Do you know the Arabic language ? " " Yes , a little , " I answered in kind , then added the universal " as-Salaam alaykum . " " And upon you , peace , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life on the steppes : three bad harvests and a collectivefarm committee that put too much land in cotton , too little in grain ; religion discouraged by the government but still observed at home ; six sons , two in the army . The soaring birthrate of Soviet Central Asia 's Muslims ? their numbers grow some 3 percent a year , or five times faster than the Russians themselves ? may well be viewed  | with misgivings in the Kremlin . Indeed , some observers conclude that one of the main reasons for the massive march into Afghanistan was to stifle , by unmistakable example , any thought of unrest among the growing Muslim population in Central Asia . BEIRUT , LEBANON , 1972 . I savor a stroll through the Paris of the Middle East . The neighborhood along Avenue des Francais seems a second home to me . I return the wave of Chartouni , the shirtmaker ; browse among the Roman coins at Petit Musee antiques ; pick up a Herald Tribune at Antoine 's book shop . Over arrack at the sleek Hotel St. Georges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mediterranean . But now the St. Georges was a blackened shell . It stared emptily at a cannon-pocked Holiday Inn a quarter of a mile inland . " Opposing factions fought for months for these two hotels , " said my escort from the National Movement , a leftist coalition . " Cannon and rockets . You see the results . " The herds of tourists were gone from Beirut , and many students , bankers , businessmen , artists , and writers . They began to flee in 1975 , when civil war ravaged the city . The delicate Christian-Muslim balance , with political powers apportioned by the constitution , had long guaranteed tiny Lebanon a genuine , if fragile , republic , but the balance was upset by the half million refugees driven from Palestine . Denied repatriation , confined to crowded camps , they grew more militant and allied themselves with Lebanese leftists challenging the Christian-dominated power structure . Beginning in the late 1960s , the Israeli Army , battling Palestinian commandos , made spasmodic , sometimes extended , incursions into southern Lebanon , exposing the impotence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north to Beirut . Throughout the country dozens of political factions ? Christians , Druzes , Socialists , Muslims , Palestinians , Falangists , Nasserites ? armed themselves . In Beirut sniper attacks escalated into full-scale war ? a war that , so far , has claimed 60,000 lives and left the city in shambles . Halfway along the no-man's-land of Rue Allenby , a squad of battle-ready Syrian soldiers from the Arab peacekeeping force screeched up behind us in a bullet-riddled Mazda station wagon . " Get out of here , you fools ! This area is dangerous , " one shouted , then began arguing with my escort . A block away children were playing . Two blocks east I heard the crack of rifle fire and a round of artillery . In the bullet-scarred Minet el-Hosn quarter I was invited in by the remarkable Mardinian family . Head of the house was a tough 75-year-old Armenian , Ohannes Mardinian . During the fighting he had sent his family to safety but refused to go himself . " Those who left came back to find everything looted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . Wearing robe and slippers , still recovering from a stray bullet in the hip , he pointed his cane to a large oil painting of a bygone hero wearing medals and a handlebar mustache . " One night a band of leftist soldiers broke in , " he said . " But they noticed the painting first thing . Stalin ! ' they exclaimed . This old man is one of us ! ' I poured them coffee ; they left me some oranges . " Of course , " he chuckled , " I never told them the portrait was Gen. Antranig Pasha . our great Armenian hero . " Life in the city goes on , especially in fashionable Ras Beirut , still largely unscathed . On every wall , posters of Gamal Abdel Nasser , Yasir Arafat , Ayatollah Khomeini , and Palestinian martyrs compete for space with spray-can graffiti in Arabic : " The Land Belongs to the Steadfast " ; " Revolution Is the Road to Liberation " ; " No U. S. Bases in the Middle East . " Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supermarkets are well stocked . Nearby , one still finds Paris couture at Milady , works in English at Uncle Sam 's Bookstore , fast food at Kentucky Fried Chicken , and fast ladies at the Dolce Vita or the No Name Bar . What chilled me was how many in Beirut had adapted to the anarchy . At a friend 's apartment on Rue Madame Curie I heard horror stories : a cousin cut down stepping out of her car ; the small grocery on the first floor bombed , smashing most of the building 's windows . To get home that night , my host had to detour around a shoot-out . A machine gun crackled outside . I jumped . " Take it easy . " My friend smiled . " It 's probably just a wedding celebration . " 339  | BEIRUT , JANUARY 1975 . Armed soldiers lead me through labyrinthine back streets , up a dark stairway to a midnight rendezvous . Only a bare bulb lights the temporary command post ; Yasir Arafat , chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization , seldom dares spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not with the Jews , " he tells me . " We are both Semites . They have lived with us for centuries . Our enemies are the Zionist colonizers and their backers who insist Palestine belongs to them exclusively . We Arabs claim deep roots there too . " Two decades ago Palestinians were to be found in United Nations Relief Agency camps at places like Gaza and Jericho , in a forlorn and pitiable state . While Palestinian spokesmen pressed their case in world capitals , the loudest voice the world heard was that of terrorists , with whom the word Palestinian came to be associated . Jordan fought a war to curb them . The disintegration of Lebanon was due in part to the thousands of refugees within its borders . Prospects for peace brightened , however , when President Anwar Sadat of Egypt , most powerful of the Arab countries , made his historic trip to Israel in November 1977 . A year later Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin signed the Camp David accords , a framework for the return of the occupied Sinai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opened mail , telephone , and airline communications . The Camp David accords also addressed the all-important Palestinian question but left it vague . Sadat insists that any lasting peace depends on an eventual Palestinian homeland in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza . Israel agrees to limited autonomy for those regions , but , fearful of a new and hostile Palestinian state suddenly planted on its borders , insists that Israeli troops must maintain security there . Crowded Rashidiyah refugee camp , set among orange groves south of the ancient Phoenician port of Tyre in Lebanon , lies on the front lines . Frequent pounding by Israeli military jets and warships seeking PLO targets has war-hardened its population , some 13,700 Palestinians . At the schoolyard I watched a solemn flag raising . Uniformed ashbal , or lion cubs . stood rigid as color guards briskly ran up the green-white-and-black Palestinian flag . Ranging in age from 8 to 12 , they might have been Cub Scouts ? except for the loaded @#  | rifles they held at present arms . Behind them stood two rows of girls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons . Over lunch of flat bread , hummus , yogurt , and chicken I commented to my hosts , a group of combat-ready fedayeen , that 30 years of bitter war had settled nothing nor gained the Palestinians one inch of their homeland . Was there no peaceful way to press their cause ? " Yes , and we are doing it . Finally , after 30 years , most countries in the United Nations recognize that we too have rights in Palestine . But we feel that until your country stops its unconditional aid to Israel , we have two choices : to fight , or to face an unmarked grave in exile . " AFTER CROSSING the Allenby Bridge from Amman , I drove across the fertile Jordan Valley through Arab Jericho and past some of the controversial new Jewish settlements : Mitzpe Jericho , Tomer , Maale Adumim , Shilat . Then as I climbed through the steep stony hills to Jerusalem , I saw that it too had changed . A ring of highrise apartments and offices was growing inexorably around the occupied Arab side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scores of Arab houses had been leveled during extensive reconstruction . " Already 64 settlements have been built on the West Bank , " said a Christian Palestinian agriculturist working for an American church group in Jerusalem . " And another 10 are planned , " he said . Unfolding a copy of the master plan prepared in 1978 by the World Zionist Organization , he read : " Realizing our right to Eretz-Israel. . . . with or without peace , we will have to learn to live with the minorities .... " The Israeli Government has reaffirmed the policy . In Prime Minister Menachem Begin 's words : " Settlement is an inherent and inalienable right . It is an integral part of our national security . " " Security " is a word deeply etched into the Israeli psyche . The country has lived for 30 years as an armed camp , always on guard against PLO raids and terrorist bombings . Whenever such incidents occur , the response is quick : even greater retaliation . In Jerusalem I met with David Eppel , an English-language broadcaster for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build this country . Israel is our lawful home , our destiny . We have the determination , and an immense pool of talent , to see it through . " @# @#  | His cosmopolitan friends ? a city planner , a psychology professor , an author ? gathered for coffee and conversation at David 's modern apartment on Jerusalem 's Leib Yaffe Road . Amia Lieblich 's book , Tin Soldiers on Jerusalem Beach , studies the debilitating effects almost constant war has had on life in the Jewish state , a nation still surrounded by enemies . As she and her husband kindly drove me to my hotel in Arab Jerusalem afterward , some of that national apprehension surfaced in the writer herself . " We do n't often come over to this part of town , " she said . " Especially at night . " I DROVE OUT of the Old City in the dark of morning and arrived a few hours later at the nearly finished Israeli frontier post , whence a shuttle bus bounced me through no-man's-land to the Egyptian terminal . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time since 1948 to travel overland from Jerusalem to Cairo . An Egyptian customs man opened my bags on a card table set up in the sand . I took a battered taxi into nearby El Arish , to a sleepy bank that took 45 minutes to convert dollars into Egyptian pounds . Then I hired a Mercedes for the 200-mile run across the northern Sinai desert , the Suez Canal , and the Nile Delta . By sundown Cairo was mine . Despite official government optimism , I found many in Cairo worried that President Sadat 's bold diplomatic gestures might fail . The city was noticeably tense as Israel officially opened its new embassy on Mohi el-Din Abu el-Ez Street in Cairo 's Dukki quarter . Black-uniformed Egyptian troops guarded the chancery and nearby intersections as the Star of David flew for the first time in an Arab capital . Across town , police with fixed bayonets were posted every ten feet around the American Embassy . Others were posted at the TV station and the larger hotels . Protests were scattered , mostly peaceful . None @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegations of tourists and businessmen from Europe and the U. S. , Cairo was busier than ever ? and more crowded . Despite a building boom . many Egyptians migrating from the countryside , perhaps 10,000 a month , still find housing only by squatting among tombs at the City of the Dead , the huge old cemetery on the southeast side of the capital . Even with the new elevated highway and wider bridge across the Nile , half-hour traffic standstills are common . Commuters arrive at Ramses Station riding even the roofs of trains , then cram buses until axles break . Cairo smog , a corrosive blend of diesel fumes and hot dust from surrounding deserts , rivals tear gas . Despite the rampant blessings of progress , Cairo can still charm . In the medieval Khan el-Khalili bazaar near Cairo 's thousand-year-old Al-Azhar University , I sought out Ahmad Saadullah 's sidewalk cafe . I found that 30 piasters ( 45 cents ) still brings hot tea , a tall water pipe primed with tobacco and glowing charcoal , and the latest @#  | gossip . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we dispensed with weather and the high cost of living and got right to politics : " Of course I am behind President Sadat , but he is taking a great risk . The Israelis have not fully responded . If Sadat fails , no other Arab leader will dare try for peace again for a generation . " Across town at the weekly Akhbar ElYom newspaper , one of the largest and most widely read in the Middle East , chief editor Abdel-Hamid Abdel-Ghani drove home that same point . " What worries me most is that President Sadat 's agreement with Israel has isolated Egypt from our brother nations , " he told me . " When Saudi Arabia broke with us , it was a heavy loss . The Saudis are our close neighbors . Now they have canceled pledges for hundreds of millions in development aid to Egypt . Some 200,000 Egyptians ? teachers , doctors , engineers ? live and work in the kingdom . " And Saudi Arabia , guardian of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina , remains for Muslim Egypt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Across the rooftops from the highest minarets peal the calls to early morning prayer : " Come to salvation . Prayer is better than sleep .... " I am swept up in the largest religious gathering on earth , the annual pilgrimage to Mecca . Pious crowds surge through narrow streets and covered markets to the great Sacred Mosque , heart and focus of the holy city . We come from a score of nations and cultures , but each of us now wears the humble ihram , the simple pilgrim costume of white cotton . Inside the shrine , blacksmith , banker , Bedouin ? prime minister or pauper ? all bow in unison , all equal in the eyes of the Almighty . Those narrow streets seemed unusually quiet this time . Around Islam 's holiest shrine hundreds of masons and carpenters labored , repairing the heavy doors , filling gaping shell holes in the minarets , replacing scarred marble panels . A few weeks earlier an armed band , led by a radically fundamentalist Muslim from Saudi Arabia 's hinterland , had seized the Sacred Mosque , protesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders . Outrage swept the Muslim world . In Libya and Pakistan , fired by false rumors that the United States was involved in this sacrilege , mobs attacked U. S. embassies . In Mecca the forces that had profoundly changed the Middle East I knew became clearer in the face of the most profound force of all ? the largest transfer of wealth in human history . Industrialized nations poured untold billions in oil payments into the coffers of governments that ruled populations whose values sprang from relative poverty , simplicity , and faith . To protect those societies from moral crumbling under the assault of wealth , fundamentalist religious leaders had risen ? with potent political impact . Jiddah , the kingdom 's commercial capital , a small desert seaport when I first landed there 19 years ago , had swelled to a metropolis of perhaps a million people . Overwhelmed by oil prosperity , it has become , according to a recent survey by the Union Bank of Switzerland , the most expensive city in the world . With students of King Abdulaziz University in Jiddah , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister of Industry and Electricity . " We must not depend on foreigners to run the machinery of our country , " Dr. Algosaibi warned . " They neither understand nor care about our culture . " We are blessed with revenue , " he continued , " but unless we develop skills , money will not solve our problems . " All across the Middle East I saw this clash between Western-style modernization and traditional values . Now new external pressures build as the oil-seeking superpowers maneuver for position around the wells . Encircled by events beyond their control . the Muslim nations fear that the Soviet Union will maintain its hold on Afghanistan , and that United States countermoves will make pawns of the region 's nations . Internal strife gnaws away at Iran , Iraq . Lebanon , and other nations with strident minority groups . Continued Israeli settlement on the West Bank , over official United States objections , threatens Sadat 's peace initiatives , as do continuing PLO raids . In Islam 's anguished heartland , some fear , lie the bitter seeds of global war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
