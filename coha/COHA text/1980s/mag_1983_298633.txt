You ca n't plant a seed and pick the fruit the next morning . <P> That epitgram is one of nine catchy admonitions given students by high school teachers who take part in Jesse Jackson 's " Push for Excellence " program . <P> His defenders sometimes use it to explain why specific results are so hard to measure in and which is designed to motivate students to work harder and learn more in school . It is also used as a defense for Jackson 's other major project , a series of " trade covenants " in which large corporations agree to hire more blacks and use the services of minority-owned businesses . Jackson 's critics , on the other hand , contend that results are meager because Jackson does not tend the orchard long enough to ensure a harvest . <P> More inspirational crusade than a program of substance ( " I am a preacher , not an educator , " Jackson readily admits ) , PUSH-EXCEL exemplifies Jackson 's belief that black students can not just blame poor schools if they do not learn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new book or an old book if we open neither ? " asks another of PUSH-EXCEL 's epigrams . White educators , in particular , praised this self-help philosophy when Jackson began advocating it in 1976 . By 1981 the program had been officially adopted by some 35 high schools in nine cities . <P> Typically , schools in the program would have Jackson , other prominent blacks or the principal lead an inspirational rally early in each school year . Students would be asked to sign pledges that they would devote at least two hours to their homework each night . Parents would agree personally to pick up report cards for their children , thus meeting the teachers . Written codes of conduct would govern student behavior . On graduation , each senior would get a voter registration card as well as a diploma . <P> The program was funded with private contributions until 1978 , when the Carter Administration began providing federal grants . About $4.5 million was awarded before the funding stopped when the Reagan Administration took office . For two years federal accountants have been conducting what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not found full documentation for $935,000 and are not certain that an additional $779,000 was legally distributed . Meanwhile , the program continues in only 15 schools in four cities : Chicago ; Charleston , S.C. ; Chattanooga , Tenn. ; and Shaker Heights , Ohio . <P> Jackson 's agreements with corporations are relatively recent , and their long-term impact is impossible to predict . Since 1981 , PUSH has signed contracts with five firms : Coca-Cola , Seven-Up , Kentucky Fried Chicken , Burger King and Southland Corp. , which owns 7-Eleven minimarkets and Chief auto-parts stores . Jackson 's goal in these agreements , which are not legally binding , is to get a dollar 's worth of economic benefits for blacks in return for every dollar blacks spend on the companies ' products , as determined through market research .
