V I D A L240like Napoleon  --  was he not the Young Napoleon ? But then , in the face of an actual hero of the republic 's wars , McClellan withdrew the hand from his tunic . " You were called here by my advice , " said Scott . " The times require vigilance and activity . 1 am not active and never shall be again . When I proposed that you should come here to aid , not supersede me , you had my friendship and confidence . " General Scott paused ; then he murmured , " You still have my confidence . " On that note , the old man left the room , something that his sense of protocol had never before allowed him to do without the President 's leave . AT FOUR-THIRTY in the morning of November 3 , General WinfieldScott left Washington from the Baltimore depot , en route to Europe . McClellan was now general-in-chief as well as commander of the Army of the Potomac . " I can do it all , " he had told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazed at his former minion , Cameron , all was changed . McClellan no longer turned to Seward as the natural leader of the government ; but then he did not turn to anyone , so great was his youthful vanity . Meanwhile , Cameron had made an unexpected alliancewith Chase and the radically minded Republicans in Congress . Cameronhad come out for enlisting in the army those former slaves that had been liberated by the Union army . Lincoln had been as furious with Cameron as he had been in September when General Fremont had not only declared martial law in Missouri but had then announced that he would confiscate the property of all secessionists , including their slaves , who were to be freed . This had delighted the abolitionists while causing Lincoln to declare , with anguish , to Seward , " This is a war for a great national idea , the Union , and now Fremont has tried to drag the Negro into it ! " Lincoln annulled the proclamation ; relieved Fremont of his command ; and incurred the enmity of Congress 's radical Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said good-bye to the President , he hoped that he could be out of the room before Cameron could buttonhole him . " We 'll see you New Year 's Day , wo n't we ? " The Presidentwas amiable . " With both your handsome daughters ? " Lincoln stared down at Chase , a vague smile on his lips . He was never anything but the soul of courtesy and forebearance , thought Chase , full of Christian charity on this the anniversary of Christ 's miraculous birth . " Oh , yes , sir ! My young ladies look forward with pleasure to seeing you  --  and Mrs. Lincoln , as do I. " Chase managed to ruin every " s " in the sentence ; but did not care . Although he was not exactly at ease withLINCOLN 24ILincoln , he never felt any constraint when they were together . Chase was also aware of Lincoln 's profound regard for him as an educated man , with a lifetime 's experience in the higher realm of politics . " By the way , I suspect that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the next loan , and I think that we should plan seriously for the issuance of our own government notes . . . " " Mr. Chase ! " Lincoln winced in a comical way . " Today , of all days , let me brood upon five sad things , not six . Be merciful . " Chase inclined his head . " Our watchword  --  today  --  shall be All quiet on the Potomac . ' " This had been the daily report in every newspaper since McClellan had taken command of the army . The President sighed . " As we all know , General McClellan is a great engineer , but I sometimes think his special talent is for the stationary engine . " Chase smiled ; and said good-day . He was first and forever a McDowell man . But after Bull Run , McDowell had been superseded by the **28;14668;TOOLONG , who had kept a number of Virginian counties , now known as West Virginia , in the Union . McClellan was considered the perfect modern soldier , having been trained in Europe like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Crimea . He had then left the army to become chief engineer and vice-president of the Illinois Central Railroad , supporting for Senate the railroad 's counsel , Douglas , over Lincoln . McClellan was a Democrat , which Lincoln liked ; but Chase did not . Lincoln tended to pamper pro-Union Democrats at the expense of loyal abolitionist Republicans . McClellan had just been made president of the Ohio &; Mississippi Railroad , when he was called back to duty  --  and glory . McClellan had taken Washington and the country  --  and even Chase  --  by storm . He was youthful , handsome if somewhat short and thick in stature , and confident to the point , Chase could not help but think , of hubris . But in a matter of months he had turned a frightened mass of men into a formidable modern army . Even Mr. Russell of the Times would now approve of their drilling . Chase had never realized just how awesome it could be to watch a well-drilled army of a hundred thousand men pass in review . But General McClellan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much that there had been , thus far , no military engagement of any kind except for a fracas at Bull 's Bluff , in nearby Virginia , which the Union army had lost , leaving dead on the field one of the President 's old Illinois friends , former senator Edward D. Baker . It was said that Lincoln had wept uncontrollably when he heard the news . Chase thought242this unlikely . Despite all of Lincoln 's charm and cunning , Chase found him , at bottom , an unexpectedly hard man , who would never weep for anyone  --  or anything , saving perhaps power withheld . As Chase stepped out into the upstairs corridor , Cameron linked arms with him ; and propelled him away from the others . " Governor , " Cameron'svoice was low and whispery and conspiratorial . " We have all the generals with us . There 's Fremont , who 's bound to get another command , which I 'm working on . There 's Hunter . There 's Ben Butler , who 's declaringevery nigger we free  --  I mean Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He calls ' em contraband ... " " I know . I know . " Chase hated being told things that he already knew , which was how most of every day was spent , listening politely while others told him his business . " I guess you heard what a success my swing through the North last month was . Free the slaves ! ' I said . Arm the slaves ! ' I said . The audiences just ate it up . " With an unexpectedly powerful grip , Cameron positioned Chase on the grand staircase ; then helped him down , as if he were an elderly lady . " It is certainly my wish , " said Chase . " But I 'm alone in the Cabinet except , now , for you . " Chase could hardly believe that he and this embodiment of American political corruption were speaking so intimately . It must be a dream , he thought , as Old Edward met them at the bottom of the stairs . Cameron whispered in Chase 's ear , " We 've got Sumner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big generals ... " " Yes , yes , " said Chase . " I shall see you here , I suppose , on New Year 's Day . " " Growing very cold , sir , " said Old Edward , as he led Chase out onto the portico where a line of carriages with smoking horses waited to collect the magnates . " And the autumn was so beautiful , " said Chase , wistfully . It was true . There had never been such beautiful dry weather . There had never been such a perfect time to send an army straight to Richmond . There had never been such a rare opportunity , so peculiarly lost by the Young Napoleon . As Chase drove away from the White House , the Chevalier Wikoff was being shown into Bettie Duvall 's parlor in Seventeenth Street . From time to time , in the most casual way , they had met at those houses where the grand people of every persuasion gathered . They had first been introduced to each other by the Widow Greenhow , whom the Chevalier had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duvall plain in appearance but delightful in manner , largely because of her bold secessionist statements . LINCOLN 243Since the house arrest of Mrs. Greenhow in August , he had got to know Miss Duvall even better ; and if she had charmed him he had also charmed her . But then , in a sense , each was in the same business . Miss Duvall led the Chevalier into her somewhat overfurnished and overheated parlor . Miss Duvall 's aunt was not in view . But then she was never in view . Miss Duvall came and went as she pleased . It was said that she had money of her own . It was said that she had a beau , in the Confederate Army . " This is a pleasure , Chevalier . " " I was on my way to . . . the other house , " delicately , he indicated that corner of the Mansion which was visible through the iced-over window , " when I thought I 'd pay my respects . " Miss Duvall sent for tea . Then they sat in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dared to come . Mr. Pinkerton 's men watch me morning , noon and night . I expect to end up any day at Fort Greenhow . " Wikoff was grave . " I pray you remain at large , Miss Duvall . " " That is a generous prayer , Chevalier . Does this mean that you are a secret secessionist ? " " Pas moi . " But then Wikoff realized that despite Miss Duvall 's name , she did not speak French , unlike his patroness the Republican Queen , Wikoff 's epithet for Mrs. Lincoln had so caught on throughout the countrythat now both the unfriendly as well as the friendly Press had taken it up , to the President 's dismay and to Mrs. Lincoln 's delight . Happily , neither suspected that Wikoff was the author . From the beginning , Bennetthad agreed that Wikoff must never sign his dispatches ; thus , he could continue to be not only Mrs. Lincoln 's devoted cavalier servente but Mr. Bennett 's man at the Mansion . " I am , " said Wikoff , " simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I always told Mrs. Greenhow what a pity it was that she did not go to the Mansion when . . . she could . She would have had a lot in common with Mrs. Lincoln . " Miss Duvall was sardonic . " If what the papers write is true about Mrs. Lincoln 's loyalty to our native country , why , yes , I 'm sure that our hearts all beat as one . But if that 's the case , then all the more reason for Rose  --  and me  --  to stay away and not compromise her . You realize , sir , that I am notorious for my outspoken sympathies . " Wikoff raised one hand , as if in benediction . " Miss Duvall , you are much admired for your candor and your courage . I should n't be surprised if the President himself does not think you a valuable asset at this time , to keep a line , as it were , of communication to the reb  --  To the Confeder-ates . " GORE V I D A L244 GORE VIDAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at what state the brewing had got . " Well , if he is so eager to use me  --  and I am happy to be of use  --  tell him that I 'd appreciate it if he would ask Mr. Pinkerton 's secret service to stop staring through my windows , and going through my desk when no one 's in the house . We spies never leave evidence lying about . " " I do n't quite know how I shall put that to him , but I 'll do my best if I have the chance . " Wikoff was somewhat uncomfortable . He had not been aware that the house was being watched . But then the ambassador of James Gordon Bennett ought to be above suspicion . " Actually , General McClellan 's the person to speak to about the secret service . Apparently , Mr. Pinkerton used to work for the Illinois Central , the General 's old employer . Anyway , the secret service now reports directly to our Young Napoleon and not to the Executive Mansion . " " Whoever his men report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Why today ? " " Because we 've just won a great victory . " Miss Duvall added hot water to the teapot . " Mr. Lincoln has given way . He will let our commissioners go on to London . Now , if I were truly brave , I 'd give you champagne , to celebrate . But I do n't want to go to Fort Greenhow just yet . So we shall have tea instead  --  and liberty . How , by the way , am I to know whether you are not a spy , sent here to trap me ? " Wikoff made a self-abasing gesture . " I am practically a foreigner . I 'm hardly apt to be trusted by Mr. Pinkerton . Besides , I did not encourage you just now to compromise yourself by pouring champagne . " " That is true . " Miss Duvall poured tea ; and the Chevalier stated his errand . " I want , " he said , " to go to Richmond . " With a sharp click , Miss Duvall put her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I want to write a sort of . . . peace letter for the New York Herald . " " What is a peace letter ? " " Just that . As you know , Mr. Bennett is against the war . He also inclines to the South . " " But not too far . After all , he has yet to go to jail for his principles . How many newspapers has Mr. Lincoln shut down ? " Miss Duvall 's somewhat beaky smile did not waver as her thin lips tightened , and the sharp curved nose more than ever resembled a crow 's beak . " A dozen , perhaps . But I think that it is more Mr. Seward  --  and the generals  --  who do the shutting down of presses and the arresting of editors . It is my impression , perhaps mistaken , that Mr. Lincoln spends agreat deal of his time getting Mr. Seward 's political enemies out of prison . But then this is war , Miss Duvall . " " A war that your generals do n't dare fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generals . I take no sides . I 'm not a Republican or a Democrat or a Confederate or a Unionist . I 've lived abroad too long . If anything , I 'm a Bonapartist . Anyway , Mr. Bennett and I do not want to see this war grow any bloodier than it has been thus far . That 's why we think that if I should , somehow , get to Richmond , I could then send back a peace letter to the Herald , showing the Confederacy in a favorable  --  and formidable  --  light , and mentioning on what terms the South might be willing to make peace , terms acceptable to President Davis and to . . . Mr. Bennett , if not Mr. Lincoln . I should tell you that last July Mrs. Greenhow had agreed to try to get me through . But then she was ar-rested . " Bettie Duvall stared a moment into the fire . The Chevalier stared at his own large white soft hands . " Let me . . . talk to friends , " said Miss Duvall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's the boy from Thompson 's , Miss . " " Oh , give him my prescription , will you ? It 's upstairs on the . . . " But then Miss Duvall was on her feet . " I better talk to him . " Wikoff had risen but she motioned for him to take his seat . " I 'll be right back . " Bettie Duvall crossed to the vestibule , where David stood , shivering slightly despite a heavy , brand-new , only slightly adapted Union army overcoat , bought on the sly at half price from an army quartermaster . " You wanted to see me ? " Since the arrest of Mrs. Greenhow , Miss Duvall had had two or three occasions to send David on mysterious errands . Since she did not dare to be seen talking to him at Thompson 's , they had agreed that whenever she placed a certain vase in the front-parlor window , he would stop at her house when he made his rounds of the neighborhood . " I did . But I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For what ? " " Next week Mrs. Greenhow and all the other ladies are being moved to Old Capitol prison . David whistled ; then he smiled . " I reckon she 'll give them Feds a mighty hard time . " " I reckon she will , " said Bettie Duvall . " But , one thing , we 'll have aneasier time getting to her there than we 've had here , with everybodywatching . So you be careful , " she added , as she turned back into the hall . " Do n't worry , Miss . Nobody ever pays me any mind . " This was true , he thought , bitterly , as he went out into the street . Despite the new overcoat , he found the day arctic . But then for the true Southerner , winter is never not a disagreeable surprise . David turned left into Pennsylvania Avenue . At Lafayette Square , he stopped and stared at the President and his spiffy-looking young secretary Mr. Hay , whose moustaches were now longer and silkier than his own . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he . Even so , Hay 's new moustaches were far more effective than his own dull dark ones . The two men , one tall and thin , the other short and slight , looked like two black sticks against the snow . They were walking , quickly , toward Mr. Seward'shouse . As always , they were talking animatedly ; and , as always , there were no guards in sight except for the cavalryman at the corner of Sixteenth Street who sharply raised his sabre in salute , causing the Presidentabsently to raise his tall silk hat . Then the two men entered the Old Club House . Miss Duvall and the Chevalier Wikoff had also witnessed this not unfamiliar scene . " How easy , " said the girl , thoughtfully , " it would be to kill him . " " He says the same , which is why he wo n't have guards . Mrs. Lincoln is terrified for him . But he is indifferent , or so he says . " " He 's also safe . " Miss Duvall turned back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They would never do such a thing . After all , what would be the point ? Mr. Seward 's the real power ... " " So shoot Mr. Seward ! " The Chevalier was buoyant . " It is certainly tempting . " Miss Duvall was equally buoyant . " Unfortunately , assassination is abhorrent to President Davis , and all that he ... that we stand for . For now the tyrants are safe . Tell me , was it you who gave the President 's message to the Herald ? " Wikoff took , smoothly , this sudden assault . " As assassination is abhorrentto President Davis , so theft is abominable to me , dear lady . " " Then how could you ever have been suspected , Chevalier ? " Miss Duvall held out her hand , which the Chevalier actually kissed , instead of his own thumb . " At every court , Miss Duvall , there are favorites , and I am thought to be one at this court . Also , at every court , there are gossips . I hope that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliance of our Republican Queen . Finally , at every court there are those who envy the favorite , and so . . . Dear Lady , you know the world . " " Better , I believe , for having known you , Chevalier . " Miss Duvall swept him a great mock curtsey . " Come back in a week , " she said in a low voice . " I shall have an answer for you from Richmond . " Happily , neither Seward nor Lincoln had the slightest inkling of what was being plotted in nearby Seventeenth Street . The President was stretched out on a settee with his legs dangling over the arm  --  so long were the legs that the feet rested on the floor  --  while Seward sat , demurely , at the massive desk which he had used in the days  --  happy days , he now thought  --  when he had been governor of New York . John Hay and Frederick Seward had been sent off to the adjacent parlor , as Seward had jovially put it , " To play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write to the Queen of England ? " Seward was prepared . He had written a draft of a letter of condolence to Queen Victoria , whose husband , Prince Albert , had died , while making more palatable to the Americans the British government 's response to the Trent Affair . Seward read the letter in his special high-Episcopal voice . He was pleased that Lincoln seemed pleased . " Send it tomorrow , Governor , and I 'll copy it out . " " Prince Albert was the best of the lot over there , and not even a politician . I suppose you 've seen the press today on our statesmanlike resolution of the Trent Affair ? " Seward could never believe that Lincoln was as indifferent to newspapers  --  other than Messrs . Greeley and Bennett  --  ashe claimed . " Well , I 've looked at some . The boys read them for me . It would appear that the Southern papers are jubilant , while Mr. Bennett and Mr. Greeley are saddened and sickened . " The President pulled a cushion into place just back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not he should keep a pair of slippers at hand so that Lincoln might enjoy every comfort of home in the Old Club House . Certainly , the President tended to make himself entirely at home both here and at the War Department . Seward wondered if Lincoln put his feet up in Chase 's parlor . Although he rather doubted it , one never knew with this curiously unselfconscious man , who often spoke as if he was simply reporting on the thoughts that crossed his mind just as they were crossing it ; yet , simultaneously , it was Seward 's impression that Lincoln never said anything that he did not very much mean to say . " I have been studying the art of war , " said the President , dreamily , eyes half shut . " Almost every day I send John down to the Library of Congress to take out books that I see referred to in my reading . You know , there are actually times when I think that I may have the knack , since war is not all that different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by other means . ' " Seward quoted ; or paraphrased  --  hewas never certain what the line was . He had come across it a good deal in his own recent reading  --  of English newspapers. 2423 CORE V I D A LLincoln nodded . " Clausewitz , " he said , drawing out each syllable deliberatelyand correctly . " Or however he calls himself . John translates him for me . John 's German is first-rate . Anyway , I do n't see why we should n't try our hand at it  --  in a sort of auxiliary way , of course . I respect McClellan , if only because whatever secret genius I may or may not have for strategy , it stops a mile or two short of training an army and victualing it , the way he does . But , basically , our Young Napoleon is really an engineer , just the way we 're lawyers . Now engineers have their uses , but I wonder if fighting a huge and complicated modern war is one of them . " Seward blew smoke rings at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . " " I think he can , too . If I did n't . . . " Lincoln stretched his long legs so that they were now at a hundred-eighty-degree angle above the sofa . As he stretched , there were a number of crackling sounds . Seward was pleased to note that the President shared at least one of his own afflictions  --  arthritis . " But I do wonder , from time to time , at his reluctance to use this wonderful  --  and wonderfully expensive  --  army that we 've given him . " " It 's possible he has too much to do . After all , he must now do Scott 's job as well as his own . That 's a lot for any man . " " In a funny way , " said Lincoln , " I 've always thought that General Scott was right . This war can only be won in the west . Take Richmond , and what have you ? A section of Virginia . But split the rebels in two , and they have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hominy . The Mississippi is the key . That 's why I want us to build a railroad from Lexington to Knoxville . " " I do n't think Congress will let you . " " Then we must find a way to persuade them . Or just do it ourselves , you know , under our ... " Your inherent powers . " Lincoln nodded . " East Tennessee is pro-Union , which means the rebels are holding that territory by force . Senator Johnson swears that with the slightest aid from us , the folks back there will drive every last rebel out of the state . " " But McClellan has most of the army right here , on the Potomac . General Halleck has n't got the means . " " You know General Scott 's last official words to me were , Make Halleekgeneral-in-chief . ' But McClellan wanted the job , so he got it . And Halleck seemed the man to take Fremont 's place in the west . " " Where he does nothing , either . " " At least he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district . " Lincoln249shook his head . " I have never known such a subtle , calculating total fool as Mr. Fremont . " " But you must admit he 's made himself irresistible to every abolitionist in the country , which means he 's popular with the Committee on the Conduct of the War . " " On the other hand , Governor , he 's not very popular with me . " Lincolnwas mild . " Why , if I 'd let that order of his stand , we 'd have lost Kentucky and East Tennessee and Missouri . . . " Lincoln drifted off . How , Seward wondered , not for the first time , did this man 's mind work ? " You know , after I ordered Fremont to cancel the order , he sent his wife to me . " Seward knew , of course ; everyone knew . But he said nothing , curious to hear Lincoln 's side of the story . " Now you may not know this "  --  Lincoln shut his eyes  --  " but when I first ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less , for female suffrage ; not exactly the most popular position to take back then , and in that part of the world . " " It is still not the most popular issue anywhere in the world , thank God . " " Well , Mrs. Fremont comes to see me late at night  --  right off the cars from the West  --  and threatens me to my face with an uprising against the government , led by the Fremonts and their radical friends . So I called her , in the nicest way , I thought , Quite a lady politician , ' and she was madder than a wet hen and went and told everyone that I 'd threatened her ! " Lincoln sighed . " Is it possible that female suffrage may not be the answer to every human problem ? " Both men were silent . From the street came the sound of Negroes singing Christmas hymns . Seward felt in his pocket for coins . It was the custom in Washington , he had been told by his officious secretary in charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to give no more than a dollar to any one of the numerous groups of singers who went from house to house , celebrating the birth of the Lord . " I gave General McClellan the fruit of my latest reading . I even devised a plan for him to use our army in both a frontal and flank attack on Manassas but . . . " Lincoln stopped . " He told you that he had a better plan , which he would execute before the end of this month . " " Exactly ! " Lincoln swung his legs to the floor . " Has he told you just what this better plan is ? " Seward shook his head . " No . He has n't confided in me since the unfortunateday when I alone seemed to know how many men we had on duty in the army . " " Yes , that was a most unfortunate day . It lost us General Scott . " LINCOLN250 GORE VIDAL LINCOLN 251 " I wanted only , as always , to be helpful . It is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears : an unexpected icy draught had blown his own cigar smoke into his own face  --  " that he confides in Mr. Chase . " " Perhaps . " Lincoln was always noncommittal on the subject of the rivalries within the Cabinet . " Mr. Cameron has also abandoned me for Mr. Chase . " " Well , Governor , you should be relieved . " Lincoln rubbed the back of one hand across the deep-set small gray eyes , as if to erase all thought of Cameron . " I regard Cameron 's appointment as the most . . . disgraceful thing I have ever done , or had to do , in my life . " " But is n't that how you got the nomination ? " Seward kept his voice at the most casual level . " No , " said Lincoln , " that is not how I got the nomination but that is what people say , which is what matters . Actually , Judge Davis may take full credit for our alliance with Cameron . Just as I must take full blame for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anyway , we must get him out of the War Department fast . What does he want ? " " The key to the Treasury . " " He can have it , once I 've changed all the locks . What else ? " " I 'll sound him out . I think you should send him some place far away . . . " " Make him minister to France ? " " No . He 's not got the right sort of keys for that . I was thinking maybe ... Russia . " Lincoln roared with sudden laughter . " Why , Governor , that is capital ! Cameron in Russia ! Oh , that is real inspiration . I can just see that white bent face of his in all that snow they 've got up there , trying to sell watered stock to the poor Czar . Well , that 's your department . You clear the way for him . " " I 've already taken it up with Baron Stoeckl , who does n't object too strenuously . Now if I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest should be easy . " Lincoln leaned forward and picked an apple from a large silver bowl , a form of rude sustenance that did not much appeal to Seward but since Lincoln was addicted to every sort of fruit , Seward kept the bowl filled for presidential visits . As usual , Lincoln encircled with thumb and fore- finger the apple 's equator and then , no doubt in honor of the new envoy to Russia , he took a bite out of the apple 's North Pole . As he chewed , slowly , methodically , like a horse , he talked : " Father Bates took me aside after Cabinet this morning and said that I was far too disorganized for my own good . He thought I should have military aides who would take down what I said , and then keep following up to see that what I wanted done was done ; and then keep me informed , and so on . " " Well , I do n't suppose any man is ever entirely wrong . " Of the Cabinet ministers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know what Mr. Bates called me ? " Seward shook his head with wonder . " An unprincipled liar . And here I am one of the most heavily principled men in politics . " Lincoln chuckled . In every way , making allowances for regional differences , Seward 's humor was not unlike his own . " And since you 're a smart man , Governor , you never actually lie . Smart men never have to . " Lincoln put down the apple core ; locked his fingers behind his head ; stretched his back . " Which reminds me of this rich man from Lexington , Kentucky , who used to travel all over the world with his own servant , a white man . Now the rich man was a monstrous liar , and he knew it , and the servant knew it , and everyone in Lexington knew it . So , finally , after they got home from Europe one time , the rich man says to the servant , Now I want you to sit next to me tonight at dinner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to sort of nudge my foot with yours under the table . ' So they go out to dinner and the rich man starts to describe one of the Egyptian pyramids which was , he says , made mostly of gold . ' So , under the table , the servant kind of taps his shoe . So how high is it ? ' asks somebody . Oh , about a mile and a half , ' says the rich man . As the servant 's foot comes crashing down hard on his foot , someone else asks just how wide is this pyramid , and our man says , Oh , about a foot . ' " Laughter plainly invigorated Lincoln . It also acted as a challenge to Seward , himself no mean story-teller of the western New York variety . They swapped tales until , sides aching , lungs gasping for breath , Seward rose and opened the door to the parlor and said , " Come on in , boys ! " And the boys did as they were told . Hay had been pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been much to laugh about . Whatever reservations Hay had about Seward  --  and they were many  --  he knew that the bright little man could relievethe President 's mind , unlike Chase , who only added to his native gloom . " Sir , I 've written you a sonnet , " Hay said to Seward . " But , John , it is still six weeks to Valentine 's Day . " " But it is today that war with England was averted , which is my subject . " Since the Tycoon and Seward insisted that Hay read his sonnet , he did , resonantly , to great applause . " I 'll just take that for safekeeping , " said I T WAS date 's notion to celebrate Boxing Day , which no one in Washington had ever thought to do before on the sensible ground that since Christmas was bad enough , it seemed perverse to celebrate yet again the next day . But Kate decided that this holiday , observed with such affection by the British , ought to be equally celebrated by their American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solved . Lord Lyons agreed . " Much the nicest of all the holidays , " he said . " At home , anyway , " he added , peering into the second parlor , where what looked to be most of the Senate was mingling with most of the generals in front of a huge crystal punch bowl that contained stimulants highly displeasing to the host , for whom water had been provided . " You wo n't think our giving up the rebels a sign of total surrender to England ? " Kate took the minister 's arm and guided him away from the French minister , whom he did not much like , and toward General McDowell , whom he did . For an English diplomat , Lyons could be surprisingly diplomatic . " Both sides surrendered to reason . " " Then you bear no grudge ? " " Oh , we hold no grudges in England . We never do , you know . " " I never knew ! " " Well , now you know , Miss Kate . I thought we all behaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I may say so , controlling public opinion both here and at home . " Lyons frowned . " But our greatest ally was Prince Albert . " Queen Victoria 's husband had died twelve days earlier . The British legation was in mourning . " It is too sad , " he said . " It is sad , his death , " Kate answered , " but the end is happy , anyway . " Then Kate turned and saw John Hay , smiling at her . For Hay , she was , simply , the most attractive girl in the town ; of her sort , of course , which meant that she would be easily outshone at Sal Austin 's , an unthinkable thought that he liked thinking about . " Oh , Mr. Hay ! " Kate 's teeth were small but even ; and reasonably white . " Will the President be coming ? " " I do n't think so . He 's still recovering from the Trent Affair . " " Lord Lyons thinks that it was he  --  and Mr. Seward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the day is saved , let them think it . Do you ever go to the theater ? " Hay made his move . Seward , slipping the poem in his pocket . " I should n't be surprised if our Johnny was a famous poet one day . " Seward then sent for champagne . " It is Christmas , after all . " When Seward offered the President a glass , Lincoln took it , to Hay 's surprise ; and when Seward proposed a toast to the Union , Lincoln drained the glass . " I believe , " he said , putting down the glass , " that that is enough champagne to last me the year ... " " Which ends six days from now . An eternity for me . Did you never drink , Mr. President ? " Lincoln straightened first his hair and then his coat . " Governor , I am a product of the Kentucky backwoods of forty years ago . I do n't think there has ever been such heavy drinking anywhere in the world as there was back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . " Lincoln looked suddenly somber in the flickering firelight . " Of course , I tried whiskey , like every other boy . But I could not bear the effect that it has on the mind , which is all I had in this world . You see , I never had more than a year of schooling and that was in littles , ' as we called it  --  a month here , a week there . Anyway , when I saw what the drink was doing to so many of my friends , I said , no , it is not for me . So except for a glass of champagne kindly offered me once a year , I am usually dry as the African desert . But I am entitled to no great credit for abstinence , since I really hate the stuff . " " Hear that , son ? " Seward turned on Frederick with mock ferocity . " If you would only do as your President does ! " " I was taught , sir , to imitate my father in all things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How sharper than a serpent 's tooth ... ' " Seward began ; then stopped and turned to Lincoln , curiously : " You were never temperance , were you ? " Lincoln laughed . " No . I am not given to oaths ; and I never prescribe for others in these matters . " " I am relieved . " The Premier was in a rare good humor and Hay was pleased that he had managed , for a time , to divert the Ancient from his cares . When Lincoln said , at last , that it was time to go , the Sewards , father and son , led them to the door . As Lincoln and Hay returned to the White House , they passed through a group of Negro singers who , much to Lincoln 's amusement , did not recognize him . Solemnly , Lincoln proceeded to give them all of the coins in Hay 's pocket . Hay had never known the Tycoon to carry money. 254 GORE VIDAL LINCOLN 255 " Naturally , I go . As often as possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Will you ? "  --  " Will I ? " Kate gave a small sigh . Then she was suddenly alert ; eyes on the parlor door . " Here comes the Young Napoleon ! " The room was suddenly still as General McClellan and his wife made their entrance , accompanied by half-a-dozen brilliantly uniformed aides . Hay noticed that the French princes were not among them . Usually , the princes were in close attendance upon McClellan in order to learn , firsthand from a master , the art of war . There were three of them : the Count of Paris , who was the rightful king of France ( and known , locally , as Count Parry ) , his brother , the Duke of Chartres ( known as Captain Chatters ) and their uncle , the Prince of Joinville ( seldom known to anyone ) . This evening they were elsewhere , to the relief of the French minister , M. Mercier , who represented the man who had usurped their throne , the Emperor NapoleonIII . McClellan stepped away from wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the center of the front parlor , where Chase shook his hand . Kat curtseyed . Hay watched , grimly . Both Nicolay and Hay had come to the conclusion that the Young Napoleon was a fraud . But neither dared breathe a word of this to anyone , particularly to the Tycoon , who seemed , most of the time , under the spell of this small muscular young man , whose flashing eyes now took in the room as though it were the field at Austerlitz . " I am here , " he said , as if he had won some incredible victory . " So you am happy that you could tear yourself away from camp , " said Chase , to Hay 's amusement . McClellan lived in a small house in H Street , not far from Seward 's Old Club House . Although Little Mac  --  the soldiers ' affectionate name for their commander  --  was constantly on the move from encampment to encampment , usually in the company of journalists and Democratic politicians ( he was already spoken of as the Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time at all in camp much less in confrontation with the enemy . All quiet on the Potomac , thought Hay , as he returned to the punch bowl . Proudly , Chase presented to McClellan those grandees that the general did not know . The general 's manners were exquisite . But then he was , as everyone including himself said , well-bred , the heir to a well-to-do Philadelphiafamily . McClellan knew the world . Ile also knew china . " UnusualMeissen , " he said to Kate , lifting a plate from the buffet and turning it over . " I take pride in it , " said Kate , pleased . " I did n't know you were a connoisseur of china , too . " " I know a soupcon , Miss Chase . " The Young Napoleon gave her a quick smile . " I 'd like to know more . One day . . . " McClellan looked sadly historical . Once the ceremonious insertion of the hero into the party had been accomplished , Chase proceeded to draw McClellan to one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low voice , " that you should tell the President of your plan . " " And have him tell Tad ? And have the rebels read all about it in the Herald ? No thank you , sir . You , Mr. Chase , are the only member of the government I can trust with a secret , and whose counsel I value . " The short general stepped back so that he would not have to look directly up at the tall Chase . Even so , Chase still looked down at him and noticed , with unusual clarity , how white and straight the parting in the general 's sleek hair was . By squinting his right eye , Chase was able to make out clearly a set of handsome features through the now-perpetual haze . Chase also noticed that McClellan 's face was somewhat tallowy looking in the bright glare of the gas lamps and that the face looked to be strewn with diamond dust , which , upon due reflection , Chase decided must be sweat . " General , I am honored that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betray it . But the President has asked you to move against Manassas ... " " His Excellency knows nothing ... nothing of strategy . He reads a few out-of-date books and then spouts them at me . " Abruptly , McClellan curbed his tongue . " His Excellency is a splendid man in many ways but he should leave fighting to us soldiers . " " That is what he is trying to do . " Chase was diffident . " It is pointless to go overland to Richmond . It is also pointless to go  --  back to Manassas . But my plan , which involves surprise , of course , can not fail . " The voice was now almost a whisper ; fortunately , Chase 's hearing was uncommonly acute . " We go downriver . We establish ourselves at , say , Urbana , in the peninsula . Then , from the east , we move on to Richmond , and Richmond is ours . " " You know that I favor your plan . . . " " I know . And I shall remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thank you . That 's good of you . Yes . " Chase was still unable to deal with McClellan 's Napoleonic style . But Hay was more than capable of dealing with the Young Napoleon ; 256 GORE V I D A L f LINCOLN 257and was sorely tempted to do so . Later in the evening , he got his opportunitywhen he heard McClellan proclaim : " If the only way I could save the Union would be to become dictator and then , at the very moment of victory , die , I would do so . " Although a number of ladies applauded this sentiment , Senator Ben Wade looked skeptical , as befitted the chairman of the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War . " Well , General , so far we have n't offered you the dictatorship . " McClellan mopped his brow with a handkerchief . " Of course you have n't , Senator . I was simply responding , hypothetically , to what the newspapers are writing . They have suggested it , not I. " Wade of Ohio was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of his mouth , and whose usual response to any statement by anyone was smiling disbelief . Wade was the Senate 's leading Jacobin , as Nicolay and Hay always referred to the radical Republican element that found Lincoln weak and generally irresolute in the holy war against slavery anywhere and everywhereon earth . " We 'll be holding hearings soon , General , " said Wade , pursing carplike lips as best such lips can be pursed , thought Hay , currentlyfascinated by the logic of similes ; he had begun to write poetry again . " We look forward to hearing your plans for next year now that this year is over , with no victories . " " No victories ? " McClellan turned to the others . " Senator Wade is too modest . At Bull Run , when our highly ... trained army was in retreat , Senator Wade and Senator Chandler  --  two civilian observers  --  drew their pistols and stopped the rout . " " I had no idea you were so brave , Mr. Wade . " As always , Sumner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He turned back to McClellan . " But , General , brave as our senators are , they could not stop the rout for long . " Wade smiled with anger . " We did what we could , which was n't much that day . The troops were not ready . " " Of course not , Senator . That 's why I was called in . To make them ready . " Hay admired McClellan 's coolness at a moment when the Young Napoleon was , literally , sweating . Either he was suffering unduly from nerves , not very likely in the familiar arena of his greatest triumphs thus far  --  the Washington salon  --  or he had a touch of Potomac fever . McClellanturned away from Wade , only to find himself face-to-face with Hay , who gave Little Mac his very special backwoods grin . " Good evening , General . " " Mr .... uh , Hay . " McClellan looked about for reinforcements but there were none at hand . " We were sorry about the other night , when you were indisposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to know what Hay was talking about . " Indisposed ? " " Do n't you remember ? The President and Mr. Seward and I came to your house in H street , and the porter said you had gone to a wedding . So we waited in your parlor for an hour . Then you came home and went upstairs , passing right by the President . So we waited another half hour , and then the President sent the porter to you to say he was still waiting and you sent down word to us to say that you 'd gone to bed . " Hay was delighted at his own courage . Although Lincoln had been amiable about the whole affair , Hay had been furious at the insult to the President . " There was some misunderstanding , I believe . " The Young Napoleon glared at Hay . " I had not realized that it was His Excellency . He comes to me so often , without warning . " McClellan again mopped his now nacreous face . " I do n't think that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen Lord Lyons bow to the President , endlessly courteous and entirely superior . But the effect was somewhat spoiled by the arrival of the French princes , who came between him and McClellan . Aware that he was now bowing to the ample backside of the Count of Paris , Hay straightened up and turned away . Chase gave him a hesitant vague smile . Since Hay knew that Chase saw less than he pretended , he always identified himself , politely , to what he and Nicolay regarded as the President 's only real rival . " Of course I saw you , Mr. Hay . " Chase drew Hay toward him in order to present him to Thaddeus Stevens , whose hard Roman face cracked slightly in order to produce a smile . " I 'm sorry that the President and Mrs. Lincoln could not come . " " The President has gone to bed , and Mrs. Lincoln has her relations at the Mansion , " said Hay , studying , as always , Stevens 's wig , so much more serious in its classical pretensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . " I suspect , " said Chase , " that I made a mistake in renting a house so far from the Mansion . Mr. Lincoln never drops in . " Chase was as droll as Chase could be , which was not much . " On the other hand , Messrs . Blair and Welles and Stanton are right across the street . . . " " General McClellan , too , " added Stevens , hard eyes taking in the prizefighterfigure of the general , posed now beneath a chandelier at the room 's center , right hand in his blouse like Napoleon , face streaked with sweat . " Yes , the general , too . " At that moment , the pale Cameron was upon them . " Oh , Mr. Stevens , " said Cameron , softly to his perennial enemy. 258 GORE VIDAL " Oh , Mr. Cameron , " repeated Stevens , in exactly the same whispery tone of voice . Hay thought of the red-hot stove story ; and wondered , as always , at how much abuse politicians could so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving now , are n't they ? " Cameron said to Chase , ignoring Hay . " Some things , yes , " said Chase , vaguely . " Which things ? " Stevens affected innocence . " Oh , the war . " Cameron looked at Stevens with what Hay took to be calculated neutrality . " Then you must come before our committee and tell us all about it . You see , because we are so remote from the grand strategy , we never know anything at all , and because we are so patriotic , we 'd never think of prying . " Stevens 's intellectual elegance appealed to Hay , even though the man was so radical that he would gladly destroy the Union to free the slaves . Hay took it as an ominous sign that now two members of the Conduct of the War Committee seemed to be proposing immediate hearings . Chase also picked up on this . " You must wait , Mr. Stevens , until the grand design has taken shape . " " I am not a young man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to see the Negro freed . " " Oh , you 're too hard on us , Mr. Stevens . " Cameron affected comity . " Mr. Chase and I are exactly the same . You read my report to Congress , on the necessity of freeing and arming the niggers ? Slaves , that is . " " A late conversion is better than none at all . Is n't it , Mr. Chase ? Or as the Bible says , He who believeth in me ... ' Cameron was not amused by Stevens 's mocking tone . " I did not know you had been converted to Christianity , Mr. Stevens . Is this the work of Mrs. Stevens ? " Chase cleared his throat nervously . Everyone knew that Stevens was a free-thinker , while , behind his back , everyone referred to the mulatto woman with whom he had lived for twenty years as " Mrs. Stevens . " Chase was about to change the subject , when Stevens 's cool response came : " Since my late mother , to whom you allude , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am or ever hope to be is thanks to her example and to her sacrifice on my behalf , I have read all the Holy Books , and subscribe wholeheartedly to the Ten Commandments , which must make me an oddity , particularly to those who regard as not binding the Eighth Commandment . " LINCOLN 259Cameron affected not to hear any of this . " General McDowell is signallingto me , " he said ; and moved away . " You must be kinder to our latest recruit . " Chase had been both alarmed and delighted by Stevens 's ornate insult . " Oh , kindness . . . ! " Stevens turned to Hay . " Are you kind , sir ? " " No , sir , " said Hay . " I do n't think I am . " " But surely , " said Chase , the only believing Christian  --  of the three , " you try to be . " " Well , no , sir , I do n't think I do . At least not very hard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he admired quite as much as he feared , on political grounds , its possessor . " You see , Mr. Chase ? There is a candid young man . He is like me . What kindness we possess is of a general nature . You will be a statesman one day , Mr. Hay . No doubt of that . Meanwhile , be candid , and tell us , who is the spy in the White House ? " " I do n't know . I do n't know that there is one . " Hay was not prepared for this brutal assault . " If the New York Herald can steal state papers , just think what a good Confederate spy like the delicious Mrs. Greenhow might get her hands on . " " Mrs. Greenhow has never set foot in Mrs. Lincoln 's White House . " Hay rallied . " But it 's true that thousands of people come through every day , and who can stop them ? " " I would , " said Chase , " if I were in Mr. Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wastes his time . He tires himself out . " " That , " said Stevens , " is what we have a president for . Even so , you should have a strongbox , Mr. Hay . With a padlock and a key . " We do , sir . But somehow ... " Somehow things vanish . Well , we shall be getting around to all that in due course . Meanwhile , in my capacity as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee , I must warn you that Mrs. Lincoln has gone over her budget for the renovation of the house . " " Oh , has she ? " Hay feigned innocence . " Oh , has she ? " Stevens mocked Hay 's tone . " Yes , she has . We will have to look into that , too . " All in all , a dark winter , thought Hay , as Chase went to bid farewell to the McClellans and the French princes , and Stevens joined Wade in a corner , where Hay could see them grinning like a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was due to meet Robert Lincoln at Harvey 's Oyster Bar ; then they would drop in on the Eameses ; then there was a260 GORE VIDAL dance at the house of the Russian minister , Baron Stoeckl , where he would abandon the virginal son of the President for the delights of Marble Alley . He might not be the poet that Poe was , but he could at least live to the full the poet 's life of the senses . Could he marry Kate ? he wondered , as he said good-night to her . He decided that he probably could ; but should he ? There was so much he had not done yet . She would have to wait , poor girl . From now until New Year 's Day , he could give himself up to pleas- ure . The President was in a lenient mood , and the current crisis passed. o N THE other hand , Mr. Thompson was never lenient with em- ployees . He would not allow David to take so much as an hour off until the beginning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Eve , and all of New Year 's Day . " Though if ever there was a time for us to be open , it is on the afternoon of the first day of the New Year , when we can supply the one thing that most men will most desperately need . " " Women , too , " said David , who had more than once noticed elegant ladies getting in and out of their carriages in a drunken state . The city was turning into one continuous party , which David quite enjoyed , even though no one had thought to ask him to it . But David had been asked to have supper with the Surratts on New Year 's Eve when , at midnight , Annie would celebrate her nineteenth birthday and become , for the next six months , the same age as David . He had seen little of her since summer . When she was not at Surrattsville , she was giving music lessons . Also , as the old Surratt weakened , David had less reason to go to their house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own house except to sleep . Thanks to the war , those of his several sisters who were unmarried  --  the majority  --  were in constant turmoil , like a half- dozen hens surrounded by two hundred thousand roosters . Mrs. Herold was now in a state bordering on madness . She could think of nothing but the endangered virginity of her daughters ; even the ones who were nei- ther entirely youthful nor well-favored caused her loudly to despair . The house in the Navy Yard was now like a military encampment . " Who goes there ? " was the shrill greeting from upstairs whenever a daughter or the single family rooster came home late , to the sound of warped floorboards groaning . In the daytime , officers were encouraged to pay calls . Private soldiers were discouraged at all times . The Herold daughters were repeatedly lectured on dangers that they understood far better than their worthy mother , who favored , one day , marriages to men who might soon be killed ; then , next day , wept at the thought of young widows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be out of the house , David had lived for two months with the ham-lady of the Navy Yard . Since she was a successfulgrocer who let rooms , she was not suspected by Mrs. Herold of powerful appetites ; in fact , the deeply innocent Mrs. Herold thought that the ham-lady , whom she knew slightly , might be a good influence on David . But when he finally tired of ham , and returned to what he now thought of as the hive of the queen bees , Mrs. Herold was glad to have a man about the house again , and straight away cooked him a splendid dinner , featuring , to his distress , ham and red-eye gravy . David wished Mr. Thompson a Happy New Year . Then he set out for the Surratt 's house by way of Scipio 's bar . The streets were full of soldiers , many already drunk . Nowadays , David seldom saw any of his old cronies , the true Washingtonians . It was not that they had all left the city . Rather , the city had so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thousands of strangers , not to mention the **42;14698;TOOLONG in faded blue uniforms . As usual , Scipio 's was crowded . But then every bar in town was crowded . Attempts to keep soldiers out of the bars and in the camps had , so far , failed . David found himself a place near the cash register , jammed between two Union corporals who talked across him and spat tobacco juice on the sawdust-covered floor . " Happy New Year , Davie . " Scipio served David a beer . " Like you see , it never lets up now . I get no time to play violin anymore . " David looked sorrowfully about the bar . As recently as a year ago , he would have had half-a-dozen wild boys to talk to , not to mention actors from the theaters and , best of all , actresses . But now the soldiers had crowded everyone else out of the barroom , just as the two corporals now crowded David away from the bar , obliging him to shove his way through the crowd , narrowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a beardless youth . David looked into the dining room . Here , at least , there were no soldiers . Washington theatergoers were still in the majority at the round marble tables ; and there were actors , too . David recognized the famous ingenue , Emily Glendenning . She was eating lobster at a corner table . On stage , she looked no older than he . But like so many actresses , she looked a good deal older up close . At the moment , she was cracking a lobster 's claw , and pretending to listen with interest to John T. Ford , the proprietor of the theater next door , a pleasant man of thirty who not only knew David by name but gave him jobs whenever he could . As David waved good-night to Skippy , who did not see him , he felt like262 GORE VIDAL LINCOLN 263a stranger in his own city . Perhaps he should go south to Richmond , after all , and join the army . But Mr. Surratt said no . Propped up in his bed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were like hangman 's rope , thought David , always sensible of the fate that could befall anyone the Yanks decided was a traitor . David sat in the chair beside Mr. Surratt 's bed and tried not to breathe too deeply the air in the room , which smelled partly of coal-smoke from the front parlor and partly of dying . In David 's professional capacity as Thompson 's courier , there was little that he did not know about the ways and the smells and the sounds of the dying . In the front parlor , Annie was playing a very sad Scottish ballad on the piano , while singing voices joined in from time to time , some taking the high road , others the low . " I 'll soon be gone . " The old man seemed so pleased at the prospect that David did not bother to contradict him . " But , first , I want you to promise me you wo n't leave where you are . " Since Mr. Surratt was going in any event , David could not see why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David stay at Thompson 's . But he told the old man , " Of course , I 'll . stay there , if that 'll help us . " " Oh , it will help us . Do n't worry . " There was a pause , as Mr. Surratt gasped for breath . He no longer coughed . Any day now , he would , literally , lose his breath , and life . " There is a man coming tonight . He is called Henderson . From the Center Market . Been there for years . Poultry . He 'll tell you what to do . " The old man reached under the covers and withdrew a rosary , which he proceeded to drape around long yellow knotty fingers . " He 'll take my place , Henderson will . " Mr. Surratt shut his eyes . David assumed that he was praying . In the other room , the ballad had ended ; and some were in Scotland afore others . There was a good deal of laughter . Mr. Surratt opened his eyes . " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're moving her to Old Capitol next week , or so Miss Duvall says . " " She 's good . " Mr. Surratt nodded . " Mr. Pinkerton thinks he knows all about us but we know more about him and General McClellan than they 'll ever know about us . Davie . . . " " Yes , sir ? " " Right now , we got one thing to do above all others . It 's this . Feed ' em wrong figures . " Mr. Surratt chuckled . " That 's the ticket ! " David was puzzled . " Wrong figures about what ? " " Size of our army . Henderson sees to it that a pack of coded messages from Richmond comes Pinkerton 's way . They all tell about troop movements , and they all give the numbers , and every number 's wrong . That'show we got Little Mac thinking our army 's twice the size of his , when it 's nowhere near . " " But we got as many men as the Yanks , do n't we ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surratt 's smile was like that of a skull whose bottom jaw had come unhinged . " We got barely half the men they got and close to no arms at all . " " I did n't know . " " You did n't hear me , neither . But that 's our game from now on . That 's orders from Richmond . Fool the fool Yankees who want to be fooled anyways , after Bull Run . Kind of hard having to admit you got whipped by a smaller army . So do n't forget that now . We double the figures . " " Yes , sir . " " John 's home . He 'll help . Do n't know just how . " The beads of the rosary now began to slip more rapidly through the long fingers . At eighteen , John Surratt , Junior , looked exactly like Jefferson Davis . " Except , " said David , " you do n't have that little beard . " " I 'm doing my best to grow it , " said John , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man twice his age . The two young men sat side by side on Mrs. Surratt 's dining-room chairs , watching some thirty relatives and friends of the family , mostly from Surrattsville , celebrate the successful end of 1861 . Annie played dance music ; and Mrs. Surratt danced a reel with her brother Zadoc Jenkins ; and John told David that he would finish up next June at St. Charles , a Catholic school in Howard County , Maryland . " I went there all set to go into the priesthood , but now that we 're at war , I think I 'll be more use to God fighting on the right side . " " It must be nice to have so much education . " Although David knew ten times what this sheltered boy knew of the world , he felt oafish when he was with him , as . he never felt , say , with Annie . But then she was , a girl . " Oh , it serves a purpose , I guess . In ordinary times , I 'd have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the vocation  --  or thought I had . So did the president of the college , Father Jenkins  --  no relation of ours either . " " Will you fight now ? " John frowned . " It 's being useful that matters , is n't it ? " " I think so . I do what I can . " David was pleased with himself ; he had never sounded so useful or so patriotic before ; but then he had not had much chance to show off . He dared not with Mr. Thompson and he could not , really , with Mrs. Greenhow and Miss Duvall , while old Mr. Surratt was the one who gave him orders and Annie was  --  Annie. 264 GORE VIDAL LINCOLN 265 " That 's all any of us can do . My father says you 're worth a whole regiment of cavalry to us . " " Does he ? " David glowed ; and drank more punch . As Surrattsville 's general store-owners and tavern-keepers  --  not to mention Roman Catholics  --  theSurratts were not temperance like Mrs. Herold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Surratts also ran the town 's post office . " I expect to take over as postmaster in July . " " I 'd like that , to be a postmaster . " David had never heard of a postmaster as young as John . " What 's it like , riding through the Yankee lines ? " John had lowered his voice . He looked at David with what David took to be piercing eyes . David had read enough novels to know that his own eyes were darkly glowing . " You just act stupid , that 's all . You know , like a dumb ole farm boy . They do n't even search you then . Oh , I 've had a few scares , let me tell you . " David told him of some , pleased to see the piercing eyes become palely glowing . Then Annie asked him to dance , as her mother played . " It 's almost midnight , " she whispered . " The New Year . " " And now you 're nineteen like me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midnight , everyone related to Annie  --  half the room as well as David  --  kissed her . Then Mrs. Surratt raised high her glass of punch and said , " Let 's drink to victory . " They drank to victory . Then David kept on drinking to victory for the rest of the night . But before he got drunk , he was able to talk to Mr. Henderson of the Center Market , not an easy task . Mr. Henderson was small and round and gray , with a beaked nose and shining eyes . Like so many of the farmers at Center Market , he resembled what he sold . David had grown up in terror of the Market 's pig-lady , who came in once a week from Virginia with ham and sausage ; though toothless , she was , plainly , not harmless ; she seemed capable , like any formidableold sow , of eating up a child . Though Mrs. Herold would talk to her for hours at a time about mutual acquaintances in Berryville , David could never understand a word the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ominous sound of a pig snuffling . Mr. Henderson did not speak ; he clucked , " I know your mother , Davie . Years back , she used to buy poultry from me . In the southwest corner , that 's me . Then we went and disagreed over a pullet 's age . That was in ' fifty-one . She buys now from the Mayberrys . In the southeast corner . No hard feelings . " " I hope not , Mr. Henderson . " " No hard feelings , " the plump chicken repeated . " I work with Mr. Surratt , too . " " I know . He told me . Just now . " " Old John 's about to end , I fear . Hope all this popery "  --  with a wave , Henderson indicated the painting of Jesus 's heart , the crucifix on the table , the rosary  --  " helps . I 'm Baptist . So all this is just , " Henderson literally cackled , " Pope 's nose to me ! " Dutifully , David laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? " " Stay at Thompson 's . Keep your eyes and ears open . The McClellans ever stop buy , now they 're in H Street ? " I never saw the general . But she came one day . She 's bossy but not bad-looking . Usually , they send a soldier . They got a new baby so there 's all kinds of things they buy . " " Try to make a delivery yourself . Get to know people at the house . The way you 've done with Mr. Seward , who leaves papers lying around . " It was not David but Mrs. Greenhow  --  when at large  --  who had noticed the previous summer a memorandum on Seward 's desk , listing the strength of each regiment attached to the Army of the Potomac . " Pity you ca n't get inside the Mansion . " " But I can , and I have . I been there two , three times , " said David . " But the place is so big you 've got to know where to go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden fence they got in the upstairs hall where the Presidentand the others all work , and which they guard most of the time . " " But not all the time . " Chicken Henderson cocked his head to one side , like a hen listening for thunder or the fox . " We have our people there , too . But not enough . Well , keep on . Stay away from Miss Duvall , fine young lady that she is . " " They fixing to arrest her ? " " Yes . I told her to go South . But she says she wo n't . I hope she will . Well , Happy New Year , Davie . I must go . I hope it 's not still raining . " The rain had stopped ; and remained stopped through most of the morning of New Year 's Day when David , for patriotic reasons , stationed himself in front of the White House , despite a head that hurt him even after a pint of his own variation of Mr. Thompson 's famed morning-after painkiller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main gate . In principle , David could have joined the long line of people who wanted to shake the President 's hand , but he preferred to stand at the foot of the steps to the portico and watch the invited guests descend from their carriages , take the arm of Mr. McManus or one of the ushers and cross the frozen mud to the steps. 266 GORE VIDALWhile David was doing his best to act like a spy , an army band appeared in front of the Mansion and began to serenade the President . As the band struck up " Hail Columbia ! " the great door of the White House swung open and Father Abraham himself appeared . A round of cheers filled the frosty air with steam . He lifted his hat and smiled . The sentries to the left and the right of the door came to a sharp attention . As Lincoln moved to the edge of the portico , the crowd fell back on either side of him , under the busy direction of Mr. McManus . But David was so positioned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could , he could have touched the President , who looked skinnier than . ever , he thought ; and somewhat yellow in the face . Nevertheless , all in all , David thought him a pleasantlookingman . The band had now finished " Hail to the Chief . " Lincoln then spoke in a loud high voice that could be heard all the way to St. John 's Church on the far side of Lafayette Square . " I am happy to see all of you at the beginning of the New Year , a year that will bring us , I am certain , to the end of this great trouble . " There was cheering from the crowd . Lincoln took off his hat ; gave a nod of his head ; then started to go inside . At that moment , the band struck up " The Star-Spangled Banner " and the President was obliged to remain standing , hatless , looking toward the band on the muddy lawn . Behind him , a small boy appeared in the White House doorway , clutching a folded flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But before Tad could be intercepted , he had unfurled a large Confederate flag , which he began merrily to wave . The crowd on the lawn started to laugh . Puzzled , the President turned ; then he stooped down , gathered child and flag in both arms and , to the cheers of the onlookers , he marched into the White House , holding his struggling burden at arms ' length . Mr. McManusshut the door behind them . As David walked down the White House driveway , the carriage of the Secretary of the Treasury nearly ran him down . Even so , he was able to get a quick glimpse of the famous Kate , who looked very pretty  --  and wonderfully clean . A younger girl was with her ; and a spinster-looking woman . David decided that he should keep a commonplace book . But first he would have to learn how to write in code . Chase led his daughters , Kate and Nettie , and his old friend Susan Walker of Cincinnati into the crowded East Room , where Lincoln stood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side , shook no hands but smiled and nodded to all  --  except Kate , to whom she merely nodded , and to Chase , to whom she merely pursed her lips , unaware thatLINCOLN 2 6 7 her expression was entirely invisible to him as he glided through his usual subaqueous element . Lincoln shook Chase 's hand ; then he said , in a low voice , " Have you seen our Young Napoleon ? " " No , sir . I called . But they would not let me in to see him . " " I had the same experience . " " I am told that it is typhoid . He 'll be in bed at least a month . " " I heard the same . " Lincoln frowned . " Others have seen him . " " Who ? " But Lincoln merely shook his head ; and turned to the next visitor in line , the minister from the Hansen Republic of Bremen , Baron Schleiden , a drinking crony , Chase knew , of Seward 's . The redoing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father what she took to be the most expensive highlights , beginning with the huge velvet rug . " Sea green , with roses , " she said . " Yes , I see the green . I will take the roses on trust . " " I rather think that 's how she got the rug , " said Kate , beaming and nodding as the diplomatic corps made the rounds of the room , wishingeveryone a Happy New Year . " They say it cost two thousand five hundreddollars . " " Does she mean to compete with the youthful mistress of Sixth and E ? " " Father ! I am economical . Mrs. Lincoln is not . " " I know . Mr. Stevens tells me she has gone so far over Congress 's budget that the President will have to pay out of his own pocket . He wo n't like that . He is a frugal man . " " Like you . " " Oh , I am doomed to debt . " " Shall I marry Governor Sprague , and finance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . " " In debtors ' prison , " said Kate , giving her hand to Lord Lyons , who kissed it while Chase beamed and said , " Pax est perpetuo ! " " Oh , let 's hope so , Mr. Chase . Let 's hope so . We 've done good work , all of us . " " You and Mr. Seward , particularly , " said Chase . " Mr. Seward has heard his name invoked . " The small roguish figure was suddenly at Chase 's side , shaking Kate 's hand with his right and Chase 's with his left , while looking at Lord Lyons , who said , " I wasdiscussing the good work we did , you and I , to keep the hotheads from going to war . " " Simply newspaper talk , " said Seward airily . " Also it helped my having268 GORE VIDAL LINCOLN 269got to know your government in the summer of ' fifty-nine when I took my grand tour of Europe , and everyone greeted me with such warmth . You see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to be the next President . " " Which is exactly what you thought , was n't it ? " said Kate . " Well , let 's say if I did n't think it , I never let on . Anyway , I met the lot , from Queen Victoria , who shows slightly more than an inch of upper gum when she laughs  --  " " Sir , this is casus belli . " Lyons was stern . " Sir , in western New York a show of gum is considered the outward and visible sign of God 's especial favor . " " War is averted . We shall not set the world aflame just yet . " Lyons enjoyed quoting Seward to Seward . " But I must remind you , we are all in mourning for Prince Albert . " Kate turned to Lyons . " The press tells us that she is mad with grief . " " Your press will tell you anything , Miss Chase . " Lyons was serene , as always . " The Queen is not mad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it , Mr. Seward , that the Prince should have died while consulting with the ministry on the Trent Affair . " " I suspect we are all in his debt , " said Seward , graciously . " But I have never been able to fathom just how powerful your powerless sovereigns are " " We have the same difficulty , " said Lyons , " trying to fathom exactly how powerful the Secretary of State is in a presidential system . " " Touche ! " Kate exclaimed . Then she asked Lyons for news of the journalist Russell . During this , Seward slipped away , having caught a glimpse of the one person whom he most wanted to see . The short , thickset Edwin M. Stanton stood alone , royally framed by the East Room 's splendid new damask curtains . Stanton 's black frock coat , with fashionable black velvet lapels , was open to reveal a not-so-fashionableblack waistcoat with , again , black velvet lapels . Stanton always remindedSeward of the Auburn , New York , bank manager who had murderedhis mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his habitual sneer curiously accentuated by the bristly gray whiskers that appeared to be attached to his plump chin as arbitrarily as an Egyptian Pharaoh 's ornamental beard . It was rumored that Stanton kept the ashes of his first wife  --  or was it his daughter ?  --  on the mantelpiecein his parlor ; and that the second wife was obliged to polish , each day , this somber reliquary . Warily , the two men greeted each other . Seward knew that , earlier in the week , Stanton had intended to resign as special legal counsel to theSecretary of War ; and go to New York , where a rich law partner awaited him . But when the word began to spread that Cameron would soon be gone , and that Stanton might succeed him , Stanton had delayed his removalto New York . Presently , he was in a state of irritable limbo . The President had not yet offered him the post that was still unrelinquished by Cameron . Although Seward knew that Chase was doing everything in his power to get the War Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Chase did not know that Stanton was also Seward'sown choice . Like Lincoln , Seward wanted pro-Union Democrats in high places . Unlike Chase , he did not want abolitionists anywhere . On this burning issue , Seward tended to admire Stanton 's wonderfully righteoushypocrisy . With Chase and the radical Republicans , Stanton was an abolitionist , constantly railing at the moderate " original gorilla , " Stanton 's much-quoted description of Lincoln , in the White House . With Lincoln and Seward , Stanton simply stood for the Union and deplored radical zeal . Seward also knew something that hardly anyone else knew . It was Stantonwho had not only written for Cameron the fatal recommendation to Congress that the freed Negroes be armed but it was Stanton who had convinced Cameron that in this way he could maintain his hold on the War Department , by giving pleasure to the Committee on the Conduct of the War . With Iagoesque skill , Stanton had led to destruction his chief . Now Iago stood , somewhat bleakly , in the East Room , uncertain of his own future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroically his asthma , " congratulate you on the Trent Affair . I thought your . . . summing-up was masterful . " " I know so little international law . " Seward played at modesty . " And I know almost nothing about arbitration . " " But you know everything , sir , about politics . " " Well , I certainly know something . " One of the things that Seward knew which Stanton did not know that he knew was Stanton 's anger at the Administration for having given way to England . Seward smiled , almost warmly , at the odd but brilliant Ohio lawyer who would soon be joining a Cabinet that , such was his oddness and honesty and irritability  --  there was no other word  --  he could never stop attacking in private . " Stanton is two-faced , " a disapproving senator had said to Seward , who was rather pleased with his own classical response : " So was Janus , the god of war . " But Seward was not above torturing , ever so slightly , his highly anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holt at the White House yesterday . " The look of pain in Stanton 's face gave Seward exquisite pleasure ; thus , he began to balance out their accounts with each other . The Kentuckian20 GORE VIDAL LINCOLN271Holt had served with Stanton in Buchanan 's Cabinet . Like Stanton , Holt was a pro-Union Democrat ; he was also an anti-abolitionist , unlike Stanton , whose second face forever smiled upon the radicals . " The President is more inclined to you than to Holt , of course . But there are great pressures upon him . Great pressures . " Seward frowned . Stanton scowled . " Mr. Holt is very able , of course . And does not hate the black man as much as people say . " Feeble , thought Seward ; but prompt . " Mr. Chase , of course , is your sponsor in all of this . You are both from Ohio . " " But I am removed to Pennsylvania . " " Like Mr. Cameron , yes . You are also Mr. Cameron 's choice , if he should leave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the honest and open way that Stanton lied ; it was the hallmark of the truly great lawyer , and demonstrated a professional mastery not unlike his own . Otherwise , they had little in common . Stantonwas mercurial and vain and compulsively duplicitous ; nevertheless , he was incorruptible when it came to money  --  a matter of some importance in the wake of Cameron and his friends who , like so many carrion-birds , had feasted off the Treasury . Stanton was also a passionate worker ; again , a perfect contrast to the indolent Cameron . " Mr. Blair favors Senator Wade , " said Seward , accurately . " In order to get him to leave the Joint Committee ? " Stanton was quickto respond . " Well , sometimes it is better to have your critics and rivals working for you than against you . " " I am sure , " said Stanton , upper lip curling , " that Mr. Lincoln has been a beneficiary of this unusual system . " " Oh , he has ! He has ! But there are times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most able man must be appointed . " Seward was aware that he was somewhat overdoing what his critics enjoyed referring to as Seward 's Buncombe ; but he could not help himself . " How do you get on with General McClellan ? " " We are very close , " said Stanton . " In fact , he came to me just the other day for a legal opinion on the Trent Affair . " Seward laughed ; to disguise his anger . " And here I thought he was busy , twenty-four hours a day , getting the army ready to attack Richmond . Instead , he concerns himself with the laws of nations . " Stanton flushed . " It was simply in the line of what he takes to be his duty as general-in-chief . " Seward let the matter drop . " You think him capable ? " he asked . Stanton nodded . " He is certainly preferable to Halleck . General Scott 's ... legacy . " " Yes . " Seward was noncommittal . Then his friend Baron Schleiden approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Trent Affair . When Seward had accepted the last of a dozen verbal garlands , he turned to Stanton ; and found him gone . " Is that . . . or was that , " asked Schleiden , " the next Secretary of War ? " " Now , Baron , if I did n't know for certain , I would gladly tell you . " Seward linked his arm through Schleiden 's . " Come by my house later , and we shall play a rubber of whist , and I will give you news that will inflame the Baltic sea , and turn to ashes your native Bremen , the Venice of the north . " " Actually , we are more the Leghorn of the north , " said the amicable Baron , bowing low to Mrs. Lincoln , as they passed . Mary gave a courteous nod to Baron Schleiden , whom she mistrusted because of his friendship for Seward ; and she gave Seward a sweet smile because of the President 's mistaken trust in him . Then , to her horror , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the doorway a moment ; bowed at Mary , who did not respond ; then he withdrew , to her relief . " I told him not to come . " Resplendent in his uniform as brigadiergeneral , Dan Sickles had seen the whole mute exchange . " Would , sir , that he had followed your advice . " Mary carefully set a smile on her lips . As they talked to each other in low voices , her eyes were not on Sickles but on the parade of notables who moved past her , bowing and curtseying . " Why does he stay on in Washington ? " she asked . " Mr. Bennett 's orders . " " Why does he come here ? " " To ingratiate himself , I suppose . He 's asked me to be his defense attorney . " " Defense ! " Mary 's smile vanished . She turned to Sickles . " Is there to be a trial ? " Sickles shook his head . " I wish there was . You 'd both be safer . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn between anger and terror . " I 'm sorry , Mrs. Lincoln . I only meant that since your name will bebrought into all this in any case , we could control events more easily ina court of law . " " Where , if not a law court , is he . . . are we , as you put it , sir , to be tried ? " " Before the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives . " " My God ! " Mary wrung the stems of the hothouse flowers that she heldin both hands. 27 2 GORE V I D A L " Because they are all my old colleagues , the Chevalier wants me to act as his counsel . " " But , sir , what do they have to go on ? Simply rumors in the vampire press .. . " I 'm sorry , Mrs. Lincoln . I thought you knew . Yesterday the committeeobtained a copy of the telegram that our friend Wikoff sent to the Herald . There were parts of the President 's message in it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the message went to Congress . " Mary wondered what the effect might be if she were to faint ; and to remain unconscious until all of this had passed ; or , better yet , to die . Between the Wikoff scandal and the constant turmoil regarding the money that she was spending on the White House , death would be a convenient release . " What , " asked Mary , summoning up every reserve of coolness that she possessed , " will your defense be ? " " I do n't know . " Sickles looked at her , thoughtfully . " What do you think it should be ? " " Whatever , " said Mary , " is the truth , I suppose . Does the Chevalier say who it was that gave him the message ? " Mary was pleased with her own show of coolness . " No , " said Sickles . Then he added , ominously , " Madam . " " Will he say that it was I ? " " He must not . " Sickles stared directly into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not , ever , say such a thing . Can you . . . see to that , General ? " " I think so , Madam . We are at war . " " Yes . " Mary was grim . " And we must not give comfort to the enemy , or show any division in our ranks . " The President approached them , smiling . " Come on , Mother , " he said . " The Marine Band wants to serenade us . Good to see you , General . " " Mr. President . " Sickles clicked his heels . He was , Mary decided , loyal ; and if anyone could manage a committee of this particular Congress , it would be their popular former colleague . En route to the door , Lincoln paused to whisper something into the ear of an unprepossessing man . " Who is that ? " asked Mary . But Lincoln was now distracted by the French princes , who bowed to him but not too low , as befitted their royal birth , while Mary simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Absently , the President patted a princely shoulder . As they proceeded to the door , Lincoln said , " Oh , that was Mr. Stanton , who defended Dan Sickles when he shot his wife 's gentleman friend . Hard to say which of the two is best at getting away with murder . " 273Mary was relieved to hear the cleverness of Dan Sickles endorsed ; and somewhat bemused at being reminded by her husband of the famous shooting in Lafayette Square . In effect , the murderer Dan Sickles must now protect the wife of the President from being charged with . . . What would the charge be for having given , in wartime , a state paper to a journalist ? As President and First Lady stepped out onto the gaslit portico , Mary allowed , for an instant , a long-dreaded word to surface in her mind : Treason . THREEE W A R D Sstared at Dan Sickles , who stared back at him . Thesmall office of the Secretary of State was blue with their combinedcigar-smoke . Not for the first ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with envy of Chase 's magnificent airy office . Plainly , the difference between the two offices symbolized the importance of the " almighty dollar , " as Washington Irving had called it , over every departmentof the government , including that of the first magistrate himself . Although the Secretary of State was the first Cabinet officer , the duties were negligible except when a crisis , like the Trent Affair , arose . Fortunately , with the President 's hearty concurrence , Seward had now been allowed to take over the delicate business of censoring the press as well as the even more delicate task of determining , upon the advice of the various military commanders , who ought not to be at large . Currently , by Seward 's order , the mayor of Baltimore and the mayor of Washington were both in prison , where they would remain without trial until such time as he or the President was inspired to let them go . As a lawyer and as an office-holder , sworn to uphold the Constitution and its Bill of Rights , not to mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spelled out in Magna Charta and in the whole subsequent accretionof the common law , Seward found that he quite enjoyed tearing up , one by one , those ancient liberties in the Union 's name . Never before had anyone ever exercised such power in the United States as he did now , withLINCOLNLINCOLNGORE VIDAL274Lincoln 's tacit blessing . Although , officially , the secret service was under the military , regular reports were made to Seward , in whose name letters were opened , copies of telegrams seized , arrests made . " If only he had not sent that telegram to the Herald . " Seward knew , of course , that the " if only 's " of the world were the traditional solace of the condemned man and never of his lawyer . Even so , a major scandal involving Mrs. Lincoln would be a blow at the Administration , whose de facto chief he liked still to think he was ; certainly , the world thought that he was the acting chief of the government . Sickles made the usual lawyer 's response . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telegram . And the committee has a copy . " " By what authority ? " Seward had a sudden vision of United States marshals arriving at the Capitol and arresting the members of the committee . Then he recalled King Charles the First ; and thought better of it . Sickles ignored the question . " They have it . That 's enough . And they are in a foul mood . And they are mostly radicals . And they think Lincoln is too weak . And they think you 're too strong . And they think McClellan is too slow , not to mention too sick ... " He sat up this morning , and had soup for lunch , " said Seward , idly ; then added , " Well , the committee is not altogether wrong in its view of things . " " So we will let them call Mrs. Lincoln ? " Seward gazed at Sickles , who had always been , in their native state of New York , loyal to the Seward-Weed organization . Now this was Washington ; now this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will not let them call Mrs. Lincoln . " " How do we stop them ? " " We tell them that as she is not a government official , she does not come under their surveillance . To the extent that they might want information from her , she will gladly submit a written statement , that you and I will concoct . " Sickles twirled his right moustache until it resembled a corkscrew . Seward thought , longingly , of port . " If that does not satisfy them ? " asked Sickles . Seward spread his hands . " It will have to . That is all . " " I see , " said Sickles , without a smile . " You will send Congress home . " " No . No . I pray that we shall never have to come to that . But the President 's inherent powers are such ... " ... as you choose to make them . " Sickles laughed , without much joy . " The key to this , " said Seward , " is not Madam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " 275 " No more than what he told the Speaker of the House , in private : that he is under an obligation of strict secrecy . " " What does he say to you , Dan ? This is between us . " Sickles shrugged . " He does not say . But it is pretty clear . It was Mrs. Lincoln who gave him a copy of the message . " " Why ? " Sickles got to his feet and began to pace the small room , whose worn Brussels carpet was as full of holes as the case Sickles had taken on . " Mrs. Lincoln is deeply in debt , " he said at last . " Do you think that Bennett pays her ? Through Wikoff ? " " I do n't know . " Sickles turned toward Seward . " I do n't want to know . But . . . " Sickles paused to stump out his cigar in a metal tray . " Shall I send for Wikoff ? Do you want to talk to him ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to him , ever , in this vale of tears . Anyway , he was arrested an hour ago . He 's in Old Capitol prison . " " My God ! How could you let this happen ? " " How could I not ? I 'm not about to stop Congress . At this point , anyway . What has Mrs. Lincoln said to you ? " " She 's shocked , and I feel somewhat responsible . After all , Henry Wikoff was  --  is  --  my friend . That 's why I 'm willing to go through the embarrassment of defending him in the uniform of a general , so help me ... " " God , " concluded Seward piously . He opened a drawer in his desk and removed a folder , marked " Mrs. Lincoln . " He opened it . " I think I have a fairly clear idea of the lady 's expenditures on the White House . Major French gives me copies of all the bills , both paid and outstanding . There is one unpaid bill here , presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger than the entire sum Congress appropriated to renovate the mansion . There is also a rug that cost ten thousand dollars . There is another rug that cost twenty-five hundred dollars . There are something called patent spring mattresses . ' There are wallpapers that cost  --  " " But all this is for the White House , which belongs to the nation . None of it is for Mrs. Lincoln personally . " Sickles rehearsed , as it were , a defense . " There is another file , for her expenditures in New York  --  for herself . " Seward rummaged in the drawer . " But not paid for with Federal money . " Seward smiled . " No . Just not paid for at all . I 'm afraid that the poorwoman has a compulsion to spend money . It is a madness , like gambling . " " I would n't know , Governor . " For the first time Sickles smiled ; and the two men made a date for a game of poker at the Old Club House with276 GORE VIDALthe Barons Schleiden and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Old Capitol . How do I get in ? " Seward scribbled a note . " All you need , " he said , airily , " is a word from me . " He gave the slip of paper to Sickles . " You know , Dan , that sooner or later your friend will have to tell the committee the truth . " " No , Governor . He wo n't even have to tell them the truth . But he will have to tell them something . " Seward nodded , approvingly . " Good boy . I am sure that there are all sorts of people lurking about the Mansion who could have got their hands on the President 's message , and passed it on . " " That 's what I was thinking , " said Sickles . He paused at the door . " How much does Mr. Lincoln know ? " Seward frowned . " Unless Madam has told him , which is unlikely , I should n't think he knows anything other than the fact that Wikoff has been accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then added , " Is n't it , Dan ? " " Yes , Governor . That 's all we know . Well , I must see the Chevalier . And then I must practise my gentle arts on my old colleagues in the House . " " You do that , Dan . Meanwhile , let 's not forget that there is a spy ... a second spy , loose in the Mansion . Who can it be , I wonder ? One of the servants ? " " Or one of the groundsmen ? " " Capital , " said Seward , waving good-bye to Sickles , who marched from the room , head high , as if leading an army into battle . F O R THE third day in a row the President had not joined his family at lunch , and so Mary herself brought him exactly what he had asked for , and no more  --  bread with honey from the comb . She avoided the crowd in the corridor by slipping through the side doors from the oval sitting room into the Reception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President 's office , where she found her husband at his writing table between the windows , feet on a straight chair . Nicolay was at his side , with a stack of books . " Molly ! " The face was tired ; the eyes , too . " Come on in . I 'm sorry about dinner . But there 's no time to eat . " " You 'll eat this , Father . " Mary put the plate down . Lincoln sat up more or less straight . " Leave the books , Mr. Nicolay , and hold off the hungry hordes for the next five "  --  he looked at Mary  --  " ten minutes . " LINCOLN 277 " Yes , sir . " Nicolay left the room . Lincoln absently smeared honey on a fragment of bread . Mary picked up a sheaf of papers . " On Military Genius , " she read . " I think General McClellan should be reading this , not you . " " Since he 's still abed , I have to look after his shop as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about borrowing that army of his , and going for an excursion in Virginia . " " I wish you would . Because , left to himself , he 'll never move , except to run for president , which he is busy doing at this very moment . " " Well , I think it 's actually typhoid fever that he is busy doing at the moment . But I must admit a lot of Democrats are getting in to see him , while I ca n't . " Lincoln picked up the book which he had been reading . " Listen to this : War is the realm of uncertainty : threequarters of the factors on which action in war is based are wrapped in a fog of greater or lesser uncertainty . A sensitive and discriminating judgment is called for , a skilled intelligence to scent out the truth . . . and the courage to follow this faint light wherever it may lead .

" Every time I stop by , they tell me he 's sleeping . I suppose I rile him too much . " " Replace him ! " " With what ? " Lincoln drank water from a brown-glazed cup . " Anybody ! " " I ca n't take just anybody . That 's the problem . I 've got to have somebody . " Lincoln gave her a sidelong glance . " What 's wrong , Mother ? " " The Chevalier Wikoff has been arrested . " It was Mary 's usual policy with her husband to come straight to the point , except on money matters , where she simply lied as best she could . " I know .

I 'm sure he is . But he 's also Mr. Bennett 's man at the White House . We can never be too careful here . " LINCOLN278 GORE VIDAL " I know . I know . I 'm sorry . " " Do n't be . I 'm afraid I 'm just as careless as you in these matters . I seem constitutionally unable to keep a secret . Anyway , I do n't think that Mr. Wikoff wants to harm you . " " I ca n't be harmed , Father . I do n't matter . But you can be harmed . " Lincoln smiled . " Well , if that 's all that 's bothering you , I 'm not about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my messages to Congress , which I tend to leave all around the house , anyway . But more important "  --  Lincoln picked up a sheaf of papers  --  " are these bills that keep coming in , and coming in .

You 'll see . The worst is over . I swear it is . " Lincoln nodded , somewhat wanly , Mary thought . Now deeply penitent , she started to explain the necessity of each of her purchases , as well as the innumerable economies that she had practised . But Lincoln had pulled the bell cord beside his table and Hay entered the office . Lincoln turned to Mary . " We have a surprise visitor , from Springfield . " " I 'd better go . " " No , stay a moment and say hello ' to Billy . " " Billy ? " In the doorway now stood Mary 's true nemesis , William Herndon , Lincoln 's law partner . Tall and gray and uncouth , Herndon was nine years younger than Lincoln ; and the same age as Mary . Although Herndonwas indisputably brilliant  --  and far better read than Lincoln  --  he was , to say the least , eccentric . For one thing , he was often a heavy drinker . For another , he was radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often said by the Springfield " scrubs "  --  as the ordinary folk were known  --  that Herndon was Lincoln 's last direct connection with them , a connection that Mary would very much like to sever . When Lincoln married , he had moved into the ruling class of not only Springfield and Illinois but of Lexington and Kentucky , leaving Herndon behind with the sort of people that Lincoln had originally represented as a Whig legislator from Sangamoncounty , the scrubs. 279 " Well . . . Well ! " Herndon stared at his old law partner , affecting bedazzlement at the change in his estate . Lincoln crossed to Herndon , and shook his hand in both of his . " Come on in , Billy . " Lincoln smiled , mischievously , at Mary . " Mother , here 's Billy , large as life , as the preacher said , and twice as ... " " So I see . Good morning , Billy . I mean Herndon . Mr. Herndon . Sir . " Mary grew colder and more correct with each version of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was altogether too easy for Mary , who noted that his beard was now a somewhat exaggerated duplicate of Lincoln 's own . Doubtless this was good for business . Herndon still displayed the eighteen-year-old sign " Lincoln and Herndon " in front of his Springfield office ; and it galled her that Lincoln allowed this because , as he 'd say , not entirely to tease her , " One day we 'll be going back , and I 'll want to practise law again . " Lincoln sat Herndon down in front of the fire , while Mary remained standing , like a statue of Rectitude , at the writing table . She was formal . " I was sorry , sir , to hear of your wife 's death in the summer just past . " " It was a hard death , Mrs. Lincoln . A hard death . But then pthisis always is . The lungs get coughed up bit by bit , like red rose petals . " " A very fanciful description , " said Lincoln , while Mary shuddered . " How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 've got  --  what is it ? Five ? No , six children to bring up . " " Well , it is not easy , Lincoln . I mean Mr. President . I mean ... " " Your Majesty suits Mother and me just fine . " Lincoln drew up a chair beside the fire . On the one hand , Mary resented Herndon 's presence , no matter how brief , in their splendid new life ; but , on the other , she had to be grateful for anyone who could distract her husband , even for a moment , from what she was only just beginning to realize was a burden beyond the capacity of any one man to bear , much less the high-strung , melan- cholic , Richard the Second sort of man that she had married , a fragile creature who seemed now to be living off some inner source of energy unknown to her even as it , literally , consumed him before her eyes . Mary somewhat softened . " Do you have a proper woman to look after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From that point of view , I 'm all right . But it 's very hard to be a father without a wife . Fact , that 's sort of why I 'm here . " Lincoln shook his head . " I think you got it backward , Billy . Washing- ton 's a fine place for a woman to find a husband but a terrible place for a man to find a wife  --  that does n't belong to someone else , that is . " " In this city , gentlemen outnumber the ladies ten to one , " said Mary , 280 GORE VIDAL LINCOLN 2 8 Iproducing a smile . There was no sacrifice that she would not make for her husband , who had made  --  and would be obliged to keep making , she thought , glumly  --  so many for her . " Oh , I 've found the lady , thank you . Remember Major Miles , who lived in Petersburg ? " Lincoln nodded . " I had n't realized he was dead . " " Is there a widow ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , no . He 's alive all right . Worse luck . It 's his daughter Anna I want to marry . Lincoln frowned . " Is n't she that ... " " . . . very pretty girl , who was here a couple of years with Congressman Harris and his wife . She 's uncommonly beautiful ; and wise beyond her years . " " So wise , in fact , that she 's willing to marry an old man like you , with six kids ? " Herndon rose to his partner 's bait . " Well , at least there 's no mortgage to pay off . " " You must be twenty years older than that child . " Mary had indeed met the Miles girl ; and found her as vain as she was pretty . It would , of course , serve Billy absolutely right to be married to her . " Eighteen years , Mrs. Lincoln , " said Herndon , with a droll look at Lincoln . " Anyway , it was my Mary 's last wish that I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But such a young wife ? " Mary could not resist the opening . " My Mary was never one for detailed specifications . There 's only one rub . " Herndon turned to Lincoln . " Major Miles is not as enthusiastic as I am about the possible linking of our two great families . " " Plainly , he is shortsighted . " Mary could tell that Lincoln was perfectly enthralled by Billy 's problems . " So we must bring him around . But how ? " " Well , Anna  --  she 's got a really good head on her shoulders , that girl ... " " And an uncommonly pretty head , too . " Mary added . " That , also . Anyway , Anna 's older sister is married to a man called Chatterton , a good Republican , who voted our way ... " " But is now , temporarily , out of a job ? " Lincoln looked expectantly at Herndon , who nodded . " So if I were to give Mr. Chatterton , who is a loyal Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " " More of a moderate , like me ? " " That 's it , Lincoln . I mean Your Majesty . " " So if Mr. Chatterton were to be appointed to some Federal office , Anna would then advise her sister , who would advise their father that in exchange for this Federal office , Anna 's hand in marriage would be yours . " " That 's about the size of it . " Lincoln slapped his knee ; and roared with laughter . " Billy , you never do n't cheer me up . " " Why , Father , I thought that you were sick of people who want jobs with the government . " " I am . But this is different . This is purest Billy . " Lincoln pulled a card from his vest ; and scribbled a note . " Here , Billy . Give this to Mr. Smith , the Secretary of the Interior . There 's always something open down there . " He turned to Mary . " Just think , Mother , here we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government 's money ? " Mary felt that she ought , in some way , to redress that balance which had so recently gone against her " flub-dubs . " " I 'm sure Mr. Chatterton is no worse  --  can be no worse  --  than any of my other appointments . Besides , we are making it possible for Billy to marry , and that is the most sacred gift in my ... Sacred ? " Lincoln stopped ; and frowned . " But is n't what I 'm doing the greatest crime of all ? Billy , you know about such things . Am I committing simony ? " " I have n't looked up that word in a coon 's age . It has something to do with the popes , does n't it ? Selling sacred indulgences , or something . " " It sounds horrendous , " said Mary , collecting the remains of the bread and honey . " Well , as I am not the Pope , I guess a little simony ca n't hurt us . " Lincoln rose ; as did Herndon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we wo n't be able to have you for dinner this week . " " But , Mother . . . " Lincoln began . " That 's all right , " said Herndon . " I 'm just here for a few days , to commit some simony , and go straight home . " " Come back tomorrow , and tell me how it went . " As Lincoln led Herndon to the main door , Mary left through the Cabinet Room door . The appearance of William Herndon at the White House , even for a moment , struck her as the worst of omens . CHASE THOUGH ' I ' it the best of omens , if not too palpably coincidental , that as he sat in Seward 's study late Sunday evening , Cameron , who had come to see him earlier , had now come to see Seward , who282 CORE VIDALLINCOLNlooked at Chase suspiciously , when the manservant announced the Secretaryof War . " I told him that I would be here with you , " said Chase , innocently . " Doubtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked more than usually pale as he hurried in , breathing heavily . " I walked from Willard 's , " he said . All in all , thought Chase , Cameron had been wise not to take a house in Washington , preferring the barrooms and the parlors and the barbershops of Willard 's , where he could prowl like some lord of the jungle . " Sit down , Mr. Cameron , sit down . " Seward filled a crystal glass with brandy , which Cameron took , without comment . " As you see , I came straight here . . . " Chase began . But Cameron spoke through him . " After I got back to Willard 's , I had some supper . Then as I was crossing the lobby , one of the White House ushers gave me this . " Cameron held up a sheet of paper . " The President has condescended to propose me as minister to Russia . He wants to send my nomination to Congress tomorrow . " " But you have n't yet resigned , have you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cameron now held in his hand . Lincoln had agreed with Seward that it ought to bring about the long-desired resignation . " No , I have n't resigned . " Cameron drank the brandy as if it were water . Chase averted his eyes . " I 'm also perfectly willing to continue in office . But only if I am to be the true head of the War Department . " That could be difficult , " said Chase , " now that General McClellan is beginning to rise ... " " ... slowly , " interjected Seward. " ... slowly , " Chase repeated , " from his sick bed . As we agreed earlier this evening , you are well out of it , Mr. Cameron . Also , Saint Petersburg is crucial to us now that we are having  --  or , thanks to Mr. Seward , have had  --  so many problems with England . The Czar is currently pro-Union ; and you are the one statesman who can keep him that way . " " True . " Seward looked grave ; he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk . " There is even a chance , as you know , of military aid from Russia . " Seward improvised freely . Cameron became somewhat calmer ; and then Seward , suddenly inspired , said , " I think you should go to the President tomorrow and accept this high post on condition that a fellowPennsylvaniantake your place . " " Stanton ? " Seward nodded . There were times when Chase was obliged to admire the skill of his not entirely moral colleague . It was all-important to Lincoln283  --  and to Seward  --  that Cameron not turn against the Administration . Cameron had a history of turning on presidents whom he had served . Although he himself was of no great importance , the fact that he currently controlled the politics of the state of Pennsylvania made him , potentially , a formidable adversary . Fascinated , Chase watched the master of New York hypnotize with a cobra 's skill the master of Pennsylvania . " You  --  and you alone  --  will be able to make the difference between Holt and Stanton . And once Stanton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still in the Cabinet , for he is now a Pennsylvanian and a part of your own powerful constituency . " The fact that Stanton was a Democrat who had come , originally , from Ohio seemed to make no difference . Cameron had begun to nod . " You think he will listen to me ? " " Listen to you ! " Seward spread his arms theatrically ; and swayed slightly in front of the glowing fire . " He will do as you tell him . Also , if I may make the suggestion , give him a letter of resignation , dated a week or so ago . He will then give you an antedated receipt , and Mr. Nicolay can send that to the wire-services , to show that your promotion to Saint Petersburg "  --  Seward enriched each syllable of that city 's name with positively ecclesiastical unction  --  " was planned by you as well as by the President . " " That , " said Cameron , somewhat flatly , " will get me off the hook . " " Speaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mantelpiece , " I am expecting General Butler any minute now . He has just come in from Fortress Monroe . " " Did he come through the blockade ? " asked Chase . The fact that the Confederate navy had been able to seal off the Potomac River had been a source of much embarrassment to a nation that had been threatening , only two weeks earlier , to fight a war at sea with England . Currently , the rebel blockade was keeping the city in short supply of all sorts of northern manufactures , not to mention fuel . " I think he came overland . " Seward was shaking Cameron 's hand vigorously . " See the President first thing tomorrow . I 'll come in and help out , if you want me . " " That 's good of you , Mr. Seward . " Cameron frowned . " You ought to send Butler on his way as fast as you can . He 's about the worst of our political generals . " Chase laughed somewhat nervously . " Well , let 's leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turned to Cameron . " I have my carriage . I 'll take you to your hotel . " During the short carriage ride , Chase did his best to soothe Cameron , 284 GORE VIDAL who seemed willing to be soothed . After all , Chase reflected , as the Czar of Pennsylvania entered Willard 's , there might come a time when he himself would need the support of the Pennsylvania organization . All in all , Chase decided that he had behaved very well , considering the delicacy  --  and importance  --  of the matter. 0 N A N E Q U A L L Y delicate , if less momentous matter , John Hay was determined not to behave well , as that was his mission . The President had told him " to look after Mr. Herndon " ; and so he had . They dined richly at Wormley 's , where General McDowell was also at dinner with a half-dozen foreign observers , amongst them a British peer whom Hay had met with Mr. Russell of the London Times . General McDowell drank quantities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ate . Mean- while , his guests did their best to keep up with the tall slender peer , who drank bottle after bottle of claret , despite the disapproving eye of his host . Mr. Herndon said that he was not drinking at all this trip but , perhaps , he would have one of Wormley 's special mint juleps  --  where Wormley found mint in the winter was perhaps the only well-guarded secret in Washington . Hay himself drank only one glass of wine during the dinner , whose two principal features were a thick terrapin soup and canvasback duck , which Herndon had never tasted before . " They 're at their peak November tenth , " said Hay , who had got to know a number of the capital 's serious gourmets . " The best birds are the ones from certain Maryland marshes where wild celery grows , which is why the flesh has a celery taste . " Hay was aware that Herndon was more apt to be able to taste the bourbon in the julep than the celery in the duck . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as ordered . Back in Springfield , Hay had not known Herndon at all . He had seen him often at the courthouse or in the street , as he went to and from his office in the main square . Herndon had been particularly active when Lincoln was President-elect , with an office in the state Capitol . Later , Herndon had found a hideaway in a side street where Lincoln was able to work on his inaugural address with only Herndon in attendance . Now Herndon had a new partner . " A bright young man , who 'll do for me , I hope , what I did for Lincoln all those years . " " What was that , exactly , Mr. Herndon ? " " Well , I was the one who read up on the cases . Lincoln preferred the courtroom and the circuit and , of course , politics always came first with him . " " Always ? " " Always since I knew him , and I reckon long before , too . I think of that ambition of his like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and never stopping . . . " This was a strange simile , thought Hay , who quite liked it . But then Herndon had a way with language that was all his own . " I ca n't say I think much of his Secretary of the Interior , Mr. Caleb V. Smith . " Herndon adverted for the third time that evening to the subject . He had taken Lincoln 's card down to the Interior Department , where he and Smith had promptly quarrelled over politics . " I am a radical through and through and that time-server is a conservative , like most of the Cabinet . Anyway , when I saw we were not in the most perfect harmony , I shut up . But it was too late by then . When I asked for a place for my friend , Mr. Smith led me from office to office , pausing at each one , and asking the chief clerk , Is there room for another clerk ? ' and , of course , the answer was always no . " " Well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , I 'll be back . I think I 'm asked to dinner . At least he asked me . She did n't . Poor Lincoln , with that woman . I do n't know how he abides her . It has been a desolate marriage , I 'd say . " Like everyone in Springfield , Hay knew that law-partner and wife did not get on . Certainly Herndon had never been invited to any of Mrs. Lincoln 's Springfield receptions since the time when he had said of her dancing that she was " as graceful as a snake , " a reptilian image that highly appealed to Hay the poet but immensely irritated the Hellcat . From McDowell 's table , the peer of England  --  whose name Hay could not recall  --  sent over a bottle of port , by way of the mulatto Wormley himself , who was always gracious to Hay , and called him " young master , " without too much irony . Hay and Herndon toasted the peer across the room ; and General McDowell raised his own tumbler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have promised my wife-to-be , if to be she is , that I shall "  --  Herndon drained in one slow practised swallow the rich port  --  " stop drinking once she has consented to be my wife . I must say I thought highly of General McDowell until tonight . I had no idea that he was temperance . A bad thing in a general , to my mind . " " He is so much of a teetotaller than when he fell off a horse and was knocked unconscious , the doctor who tried to pour brandy down his throat could not get it past his clenched teeth . " " I would treat such a doctor in a more magnanimous way . " Herndon offered Hay a bad cigar , which he refused . Herndon lit up . " I 've often thought that certain phlegmatic types , like Lincoln , need alcohol but , poor286 GORE VIDALfellow , he has no taste for it . If he had , I 'm sure he 'd not go mad the way he does . " " Go mad ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Herndon nodded , as a liveried Negro removed the remains of the duck . " It was the year before I joined Lincoln 's firm , Logan and Lincoln ; it was back in ' forty-two . Then Logan left in ' forty-four and I 've been Lincoln 's partner ever since . Anyway in ' forty-one , Lincoln was in the state legislature , and all set to marry Miss Todd , when he just went mad . He was crazy as a loon , according to Joshua Speed , his old friend . Tried to kill himself . Took to his bed , would n't eat . Wrote a poem called Suicide , ' which he sent off to the Sangamo Journal , where it was published . Then he called off the wedding with Miss Todd , thinking of which was probablywhat drove him crazy . " " You mean he did n't want to marry her ? " On this score , Hay did not need much convincing . He himself could not imagine anyone in his right mind marrying Mrs. Lincoln , but if what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out of his mind that he had had the sense to reject her and then , sanity returned , he had the bad judgment to marry her a year and a half later . " What really brought on the . . . madness ? " Herndon shook his head . " I ca n't say . Because I have no data . There has always been talk that Lincoln loved another woman . But he has never mentioned any such thing to me . So it is only conjecture on my part . But I think the hell of their life together , and there is no other word , comes from the fact that she knows he loved  --  still loves  --  another , and not her . " " Why , then , did they marry ? " " He could not have the other . " Herndon poured himself more port . " Or so they say . But he could have Mary Todd , of the grand Todd family . He could move up in the world , which he did , with some help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . But except when he was in one of his fits of madness , the ambition was always there , you see , driving him up and up and up . " " Fits ? Were there other times when he was mad ? " Hay could hardly believe that the eminently sane if sometimes highly melancholy Tycoon that he saw , intimately , at close hand , could ever have been anything other than the sanest man who ever lived . But , of course , Hay could never imagine Lincoln young  --  or being anything other than the Ancient that he knew . " I never saw him more than in low spirits , which he was after he lost the Senate race to Douglas . But back in ' thirty-five , in Menard county , they still talk of a time when he was crazy , as the people in that region understand craziness or insanity . That was about the time that heLINCOLN 287wrote this little book called Infidelity , all about his lack of faith in the Bible and the Trinity and the Immaculate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a friend of his , a Mr. Hill , who owned a store  --  this was in New Salem , in the wintertime  --  made him throw the only copy  --  I hope it was the only copy  --  in a stove , and burned it up . " " The President is an atheist ? " Hay had always been aware that Lincoln almost never made any reference to Christianity , while his Sunday excursionsto the Presbyterian church were largely ceremonial ; yet God and the Almighty and Heaven did keep turning up in his speeches , even without Seward 's prompting . " No , not an atheist , as far as I understand the term . He 's sort of a deist , like Jefferson and most of the founders . I think he has his own religion , of the grandest and noblest type . He believes in an overruling Providence . But to a devout Christian , I suppose , he would still be an infidel . " Somewhat sleepy from the port , Hay walked Herndon home to his hotel , Brown 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling earlier had stopped ; and the night was clear and would have been cold had not the port kept them warm . In fact , so warmed was Herndon that before Hay knew exactly how it had come about , the two men were standing in the dark slush of Marble Alley , ringing Sal Austin 's bell . In the vestibule Sal greeted Hay warmly ; and bowed to Herndon , who bowed , graciously , to her . " The red parlor is all right this evening . " This meant that it was safe for Hay to go into the parlor on the left , as there would be no one there that he knew , and if someone who might know him should come in later , Sal would usher him into the purple parlor . By now , she knew everyone who was in the Administration and the Congress ; and she was careful to maintain pseudonyms and disguises . Nevertheless , Hay pulled his soft felt hat over his brows and pushed up the collar of his jacket so that all that was visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence acted as total insurance against any man ever again calling him Sonny . Behind a small palm tree rising from a ceramic cachepot , Herndon and Hay stationed themselves . Herndon sat on a loveseat with room for a lover in addition to himself , while Hay sat in a straight chair ; the girl of his current choice , one Penelope from Cleveland , would not be able to receive him for half an hour . Meanwhile , handsome creatures glided past them , smiling at Herndon , winking at Hay . At Herndon 's request a tall slender girl with red hair and skin like milk brought them a bottle of bourbon . " I hope you wo n't mention that I 've been drinking when you 're with ... our friend . " Herndon poured himself a tumbler of whiskey . " On condition that you do n't mention to him where it was I took you . " 288 GORE VIDAL LINCOLN 289Hay was amused that the appearance of temperance was of more concern to Herndon than a revelation of wanton venery . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this . " Herndon looked around the elegant parlor where army and naval officers decorouslypaired off with the young ladies of the establishment . There was seldom much noise in Sal 's parlors , other than the black pianist who was , on occasion , accompanied by one of the girls who played , most soulfully , the violin . " Not , " said Herndon , " that there was ever anything like this in Springfield in our day , or even now . " " There 's Chicago , " said Hay , who had made the rounds of that city during the election . " Yes , there 's Chicago . But I do n't get there much . I fancy the young red-haired waitress , " said Herndon . " Shall I . . . tell her ? " Hay felt like a procuress . " In a moment . " Herndon put his feet up on a stool . " What 's the tariff ? " " Depends on how long you stay . About fifteen dollars , usually . Sal sometimes will make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere five dollars for what he always called " room and board " ; he then paid the girl what he liked . Herndon sipped bourbon ; and watched the comings and goings . " You know Joshua Speed , do n't you ? " Hay nodded . Speed was a friend of Lincoln 's , who had once lived and practised law in Springfield . He was known to be one of the Tycoon 's few intimates , if such a closed man as Lincoln could ever be said to have had an intimate friend . " Well , Speed told me this story of Lincoln . About 1839 or ' 40 , Speed was keeping a pretty woman in Springfield , and Lincoln , desirous to have a little , said to Speed , Speed , do you know where I can get some ? ' and Speed said , Yes , I do and if you 'll wait a moment , I 'll send you to the place with a note . You ca n't get it without a note or by my appearance . ' So Speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the girl ... " Hay cleared his throat , nervously , and murmured , " Maybe , sir , you ought not to use his . . . uh , the name . " " What ? " Herndon was a bit deaf ; then he nodded . " I see what you mean . My voice carries , do n't it ? Anyway , Lincoln . . . I mean , he handed the girl the note after a short How do you do , ' etcetera . Lincoln told his business , and the girl , after some protestations , agreed to satisfy him . Things went on right . Lincoln and the girl stripped off and went to bed . " Hay was beginning to think that he was dreaming . He looked about him in the dimly lit parlor . Fortunately , no one was within earshot . Occasionally , he and Nico had speculated on what sort of life the Ancient had led before his marriage . But as there had been no data , as I lerndontermed it , to go on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient man indeed , and not concerned with fleshly as opposed to political unions . " Before anything was done , Lincoln said to the girl , How much do you charge ? " Five dollars , Mr. Lincoln . ' Mr. Lincoln said , I 've only got three dollars . " Well , ' said the girl , I 'll trust you , Mr. Lincoln , for two dollars . ' Lincoln thought for a moment or so and said , I do not wish to go on credit . I 'm poor and do n't know where my next dollar will come from and I can not afford to cheat you . ' Lincoln , after some words of encouragement from the girl , got out of bed , buttoned up his pants , offered the girl the three dollars , which she would not take , saying , Mr. Lincoln , you are the most conscientious man I ever saw . ' So Lincoln went on his way and never told Speed what had happened but the girl told him and he told me later . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of conscience , he ends up getting it for nothing . " I had no idea , " said Hay , weakly . " He was young , once . Just like you . " Herndon frowned . " But then he married that woman , and he has been true as steel to her ever since , poor man . He was  --  is  --  a man of powerful passions when it comes to women , but powerful control over himself . I 've always said that he has saved the honor of more women than any other man I ever knew . The way they would fling themselves at him . Still do , I suppose ... " " I would n't know , " said Hay , as Sal approached him . " You wanted to see Dr. Prettyman ? " she said . " He 's here . " Hay thanked her ; and excused himself . Dr. Prettyman was seated in Sal 's office , going over the medical records of the girls ; once a week , he checked them all for venereal disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what , Hay often wondered , that was worth . Since the troops had arrived , there was now an epidemic of venereal diseases in the city . Earlier in the week , Hay had developed a curious symptom which he showed Dr. Prettyman , who examined him with all the swift aplomb of a butcher at the Center Market . " Nothing to worry about , " he said at last , to Hay 's relief . " You 've got a slight strain . That 's all . Try not to drive yourself too hard in the service of Venus . " Hay buttoned his trousers ; and the ubiquitous copavia salve was mentioned as a palliative . Hay returned to the red parlor , where he found Herndon , eyes shut , but not asleep . " You saw the doctor ? " Like so many deaf people , Herndon could always hear what one did not want him to hear . " Yes , " said Hay . " But nothing 's wrong . He comes here regularly , to check the girls . That 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel safe  --  well , reasonably safe , anyway . " 290Herndon nodded . " That 's about all anyone can ever feel in such matters . They say there 's a lot of syphilis here , thanks to the army and all . God knows there was a lot of it in Illinois back in the ' thirties , when Lincoln had it . " " Mr. Herndon ! " Hay reached for the bourbon bottle and poured himself a tumblerful . " Of course , he was a mere boy at the time . Your age , I 'd say . Yes . It was about the year 1835 . Mr. Lincoln had gone over to Beardstown , where , during a devilish passion , he had connection with a girl and caught the disease . Lincoln told me this . Then about the year 1837 , Lincoln moved to Springfield and took up his quarters with Speed ; they became very intimate . As this time I suppose the disease hung to him and , not wishing to trust our physicians , he wrote a note to Doctor Drake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not let Speed see , not wishing Speed to know it . Speed thought the letter had reference to Lincoln 's crazy spell . But the note to Doctor Drake , in part , had reference to his disease and not to his crazy spell . " " I suppose he was cured ? " " Well , you never can know for sure with such a thing . But four years later he was all set to get married , and he would never have married if he thought he was not cured . Of course , he called off the marriage , due to the crazy spell . But then he got married , finally . " Herndon was now drunk . But unlike most drunks that Hay was acquainted with , he did not slur his words or lose his train of thought other than to rely somewhat more than usually on ellipsis . " Lincoln 's totally blind to his children 's faults , you know . " " I know , " said Hay . As a part of his recovery from the summer ague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Madam and Robert , whom he liked , and the other two .. . " I have felt many a time that I wanted to wring the necks of those brats ... " Amen , " said Hay . The bourbon had now reached his own head . " But little Eddie died  --  three years old  --  and the one they call Tad is not right in the head , with his palate rnisformed . " Herndon frowned . " I wonder at times . . . " Herndon stopped . The red-haired waiter-girl had returned . Herndon rose , unsteadily , and offered her his arm . As Herndon left the parlor , Hay had the sense that he himself must be very drunk or , perhaps , asleep and dreaming . But if he was not dreaming , then a concerted effort must be made to get Mr. I lerndon safely married  --  and sober  --  in Springfield .

The only other guest was Congressman Washburne . Lincoln was in good form , telling stories of the early days in Springfield . Herndon was in less good form . Mary noted that the eyes were bloodshot and that his hands shook . When Lincoln asked Herndon about his evening with John Hay , he said , " We ate too much at Wormley 's , where we saw General McDowell drinking water , a somber sight . " " I hope you imitated him , Billy . " Lincoln gave Herndon a mischievous sidelong look . " These are somber times . " " Well , I shall be imitating him soon , anyway , " said Herndon . " Once safely married , I join the Order of Good Templars . " " What 's that ? " asked Lincoln . " A temperance group that fights the demon alcohol with a vengeance , which will at last be mine , now that our affairs are all in order . " " Did you find a job for Mr. Herndon 's friend ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I took Billy over to the Indian department , where we found one of Mr. Buchanan 's appointees who was eager to be set free from the national service , so Mr. Chatterton is now an agent for the Cherokee Indians , and Billy will soon be a Good Templar . " " I am sure it is never too late , " said Mary , aware  --  too late  --  that she had given great offense to Herndon ; and , worse , that she had embarrassed her husband , who now turned to Washburne , and asked for news of Congress . " We wait for news of you , " said Washburne . " When does the army move ? " Lincoln slumped in his chair ; and shook his head as the waiter offered him a huge silver dish on which rested a roast loin of pork that deeply appealed to Washburne . " I 'm getting set to issue an order to the effect that by the end of February , no later , the army must be in Virginia . But if McClellan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln stared absently at Washburne , who was helping himself to the roast . " I thought you were general-in-chief now . " Washburne carefully stacked the slices of pork to one side of his plate so as to diminish the effect of what otherwise might have looked to be uncontrolled greed . " Oh , I am that . " Lincoln sighed . " I also think that I could probably set the army in successful motion . But then I remember that I am only a politician , and must listen to generals , who are never ready to move . The people are impatient . Chase has no money . McClellan has typhoid fever . In the West , Buell and I lalleck seem unable to move in concert . " AtGORE VIDAL2 9 2 GORE V I D A Llength , Lincoln complained of the dilatoriness of his expensive generals , and Washburne listened ; and helped himself to the last course , apple pie . " You have other . . . maybe cheaper generals , " said Washburne , his mouth full . Lincoln nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with McDowelland Franklin , trying to decide what to do if the rebels happened toattack the Army of the Potomac ; trying to decide who should command . " " What does Mr. Stanton advise ? " " He 's not yet part of our councils . He 's been too busy examining the War Department 's expenditures . " Lincoln grimaced . The waiter removed the last plates . " The Augean stables ? " " Exactly . Unfortunately , our new Hercules is asthmatic ... " Ghostlike , Nicolay appeared in the doorway . " Sir , your . . . guests have arrived . They 're in the Reception Room . " " You should be in bed , Mr. Nicolay . " Lincoln put down his napkin ; and got to his feet . " I 'm going to bed now , sir . It 's the winter ague I 've got , " he added , wanly . " Poor Mr. Nicolay , " said Mary , with some small compassion for her enemy . " Anyway , I now see why it takes two full-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary at work in the office . " " Mr. Stoddard , " said Nicolay , with quiet satisfaction , " has just taken to his bed . Potomac fever , we think . " Nicolay left the room . Mary rose . " Oh , poor Mr. Stoddard ! I must go look after him . " They were all on their feet . " Look to your own health , Mother . This is a sickly place . " As Lincoln turned to go , Herndon drew him to one side . Neither Mary nor Washburnecould hear what the two partners were discussing but Mary was quick to see her husband 's mischievous half smile . Then , to her horror , she saw Lincoln remove from his pocket several greenbacks , as the new money had been promptly nicknamed ; and give them to Herndon . Mary glided toward the two men with , she hoped , genuine reptilian speed as well as grace . " What 's that for , Father ? " " Well , Molly , I was just showing Billy some of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , here 's Mr. Chase 's honest face on the one-dollar bill , which everyone gets to see , and here I am  --  proposed , that is  --  on the two-dollar bill , which has a sort of rare look to it , does n't it ? " " Certainly rare by my standards , " said Ilerndon . He turned to Mary . " I 'm twenty-five dollars short . His Majesty has graciously advanced meLINCOLN 293the sum , which I will repay from the proceeds of our next fee . We 're still owed a fair amount , you know . " " I see , " Mary began but her husband did not allow her to finish . " You know , " said Lincoln , " I asked Mr. Chase why he had put himself instead of me on the one-dollar bill , clearly the most in use of the two denominations , and he said , As you are the President , you must be on the more expensive bill ; and I on the less . ' " Lincoln and Herndon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disliked the idea that money should be lent to Herndon , but she had also been deeply affronted to see Chase 's face so conspicuously displayed on the currency . " He is running for president ! " she had exclaimed when she saw the one-dollar bill . For once , Lincoln had agreed with her ; but he also thought it wondrously funny , " To run for president on the money ! " Now Lincoln was showing Herndon the elaborate signature of Mr. F. E. Spinner , the Treasurer of the United States . " We 're in luck with him , because no one on earth can ever forge the way he signs himself . It is a truly resplendent signature , all those curves and slashes . " " He do n't sign each one , " said Herndon . " That 's from a metal plate . " Lincoln frowned . " What do you mean ? " " That 's from a metal engraving . Ca n't you tell ? God knows , we 've been around a lot of print-shops in our day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am the greatest fool , " he said . " I thought Mr. Chase ordered the money printed up and then Mr. Spinner signed it , and made it legal . " " Well that is the way it 's done , " said Washburne , " only it 's all on metal plates . " " And they can print as much as they please ? " Lincoln shook his head . " Mr. Chase and I must have a talk . There must be safeguards . Suppose a thief got into the Treasury and . . . " Lincoln stopped . He shook hands with Washburne and bade him good-night ; then he took Herndon by the arm , and said , " There 's a carriage waiting for you at the south portico ; I 'll walk you down . " " Mrs. Lincoln , " Herndon bowed . " Mr. Herndon , " Mary nodded . Thus , they parted . At the south portico , Lincoln stood a moment , shivering in the cold damp wind . A corporal held open the door to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night was clouded and dark , and the only lights to be seen in the distance were those of the camp fires within the White House grounds . " Behave yourself , Billy , " said Lincoln , shaking Herndon 's hand. 294 GORE VIDAL LINCOLN 295 " You look to your health , Lincoln . You 're too thin , and this is a truly sickly place . " " Yes , Billy . It 's a truly sickly place indeed . Good-bye . " " Good-bye . " Thus , the partners parted . IN THE President 's Office Chase presided at one end of the table while Generals McDowell and Franklin sat at the other end . The quartermaster-general , Meigs , sat next to the President 's chair . Although Seward had been present at the previous two meetings , he had this evening sent his apologies . While they waited for Lincoln to join them , Meigs told Chase that they now all inclined to McDowell 's view that the army move against Manassas rather than Franklin 's proposal  --  an echo of McClellan 's secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the east of Richmond . As Meigs explained McDowell 's plan , Chase could not help but wonder at the essential oddness or perversity of men . If he had had such a defeat at Manassas as McDowell had sustained , no power on earth would get him to return to that ill-fated place . But , presumably , McDowellfelt that the only way to erase the infamous defeat at Bull Run would be with a famous victory in the same place . Certainly he had responded coolly to Lincoln , who had said with great kindness after the original debacle , " I still have confidence in you , General . " To which McDowell had replied , " I see no reason why you should not . " On the other hand , McDowell had lost Chase 's confidence ; and Chase had been and still remained his friend in a way that Lincoln was not . Alone , the President entered the room . Everyone rose . He motioned for them to sit . He himself sat not in his usual chair but next to Chase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Seward can not join us , " said Lincoln . " But we have another visitor , who shall be here any minute . " Then Lincoln turned to Chase and asked , in a low voice , " I had no idea that our greenbacks are not each signed by the Treasurer . " Chase was stunned by the President 's naivete . " But how could he sign each one ? The first issue of ten million dollars in various denominations would have taken him more than a year to sign , particularly with that signature of his . " " I know . I know . " Lincoln was distracted . " I did not understand . But this thing frightens me . I mean anyone can get into the Mint and start printing money . " Chase 's jaw set . " Sir , from the beginning I warned you that this schemeof issuing fiat money , with nothing but the government 's word to pay in specie one day , was unConstitutional  --  " " That sacred instrument , as I pointed out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lincoln was sharp . " Besides , Congress is the initiator in money matters , and they wanted such an issue , as did you . " " I accepted the necessity because I saw no other way of financing this war . " Chase prayed that the others in the room could not hear what they were saying , because if the word were to circulate that the President , whose face was on the two-dollar bills , had no idea what the greenbacks actually represented , the entire fragile currency of the United States would go crashing . But the generals were huddled together in their usual world of high intrigue . " But I did insist that we attach our moneymachineto the creation of an internal revenue system and a national banking act and ... " " You have been meticulous , " Lincoln interrupted him . " I have not . But we must ensure the safety of the Treasury 's printers . " " Sir , if you have faith in me and in Mr. Spinner ... " " I have every faith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , we must delegate authority . " Unlike Seward , Chase seldom interrupted the President . But now he was angry . " You must trust us to be able to appoint honest printers , and clerks to count the money and carriers to dispense it across the nation . " John Hay stood in the doorway . " General McClellan , " he said . McDowell , Hunter and Meigs got uneasily to their feet , as did Chase and the President , who crossed to the doorway where the pale Young Napoleon now stood . Almost tenderly , Lincoln put his arm about the little man 's shoulders and drew him into the room . Hay vanished . The meeting would go unrecorded . The President 's tenderness was plainly lost on McClellan , who greeted the President  --  and everyone else  --  with a scowl . Once seated , Lincoln said , " While you were ill , I called these gentlemen together to give me advice on the conduct of the war . I also asked them to draw up tentative plans for an advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my order . " Chase noted the dark suspicion with which McClellan glowered at McDowell ; so did McDowell , who said , " I proposed , sir , during your illness , that elements of the Army of the Potomac move on Manassas . " " A strategy which I had , previously , rejected ; and still do . " McClellan 's voice was as strong as ever , Chase decided ; and he wondered , idly , ifGORE VIDAL LINCOLN296McClellan had actually been stricken with typhoid fever . Certainly , his recovery had been uncharacteristically swift . Lincoln turned , expectantly , to McClellan , who crossed his arms on his chest , in imitation of Napoleon ; then lowered his head , and was lost in thought . There was a long silence . Finally , Chase whispered to Lincoln , " Is he really recovered ? " " So he tells me . " At the other end of the table , Meigs was whispering to McClellan , who simply shook his head . Meigs spoke again , and Chase heard McClellan say , " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced at Lincoln out of the corner of his good eye . Had Lincoln heard ? Yes , the President had heard and understood the reference ; and was not pleased . Chase cleared his throat . The room grew silent ; the whispering stopped . Chase spoke : " General McClellan , we are happy to see that you are now able to resume your duties . Since you do not like our plan of action , I suggest that you tell us your plan . " There was a moment of silence , during which General McDowell caressed his paunch as though it were a skittish horse in need of soothing , and the President drummed the fingers of his left hand on the table . Chase found McClellan 's attitude mysterious . During the general 's illness , Chase had communicated with him on a number of occasions . Chase had also made it as clear as he dared that one man ought not to be in command of all the armies as well as of the Army of Virginia . Personally , Chase would prefer McClellan as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But McClellan was not to be advised , while his rudeness to the President was unforgivable , no matter how sorely tempted he might be by a first magistrate who was both indolent and fussy . In Chase 's view , Lincoln was , often , an extremely irritating and vacillatingman and if he , as a fellow-politician , found the President maddening , what on earth would a military man think of such a commander ? Plainly , not much , as McClellan now proceeded to demonstrate . " Mr. Chase , I have my reasons for not wanting to discuss my plans with this group . " McClellan 's fierce eye was now on McDowell , who continued to caress his belly . Why , Chase wondered , would McClellan not tell the President what he had already told him about the Urbana plan ? In due course , President and Cabinet must know . As for Lincoln 's inability to keep a secret , McClellan was himself not precisely the sphinx . Chase now affected the new highly reasonable voice that he had only lately learned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noncommittal . It was also a voice that in no way reflected Chase 's fiery evangelical spirit . But the297Lord 's work must be done , and if it meant sounding like Jay Cooke selling watered stock , so be it . " General , whatever your grounds , we have devised a plan which you reject without giving us an alternative . Surely ... General McClellan sat up very straight . He turned to Lincoln . " If Your Excellency , as my Commander-in-Chief , orders me to divulge my strategy , I shall do so . " " No , no . I wo n't do that , of course . " " Thank you , sir . " McClellan was swift . " I should like to repeat , however , in reference to our recent conversation about the necessity of liberatingEast Tennessee , that I have ordered General Buell to prepare for an advance . " Lincoln nodded . " Well , that is something , I must say . " Then Lincoln was on his feet ; and the highly , to Chase 's mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the dim second-floor corridor with McDowell at his side , he prayed for guidance . At church the previous day , he had not taken communion as he had found himself too subject to temptation to sin . He wished now that he had had the consolation of the Eucharist . " Very awkward , " said McDowell , as they descended the empty staircase . The gaslights in the main entrance hall were dimmed ; and Old Edward was sound asleep in his chair at the door . " I wish , " said Chase , " that Mr. Stanton had been there . " " Do they get on  --  Mr. Stanton and our general-in-chief ? " Chase nodded . " Stanton tells me that he is devoted to McClellan . " " Devoted ? Well , that is the sort of emotion that commanders like toexcite in the bosoms of others , particularly their superiors . " " I fear that the President 's devotion to McClellan is being sorely tried . " " Mr. Chase . " McDowell paused at the foot of the stairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snoring in his chair . McDowellmurmured in Chase 's ear . " I think  --  between us  --  that McClellan is afool . " Chase was startled to hear the other state so clearly his own most private fear . " I pray you are wrong . " " Oh , I do a lot of praying , too , Mr. Chase . And I say this only to you in confidence . After all , for me to say it to anyone else would sound as if I were jealous of a fellow-officer when I am , justifiably , anxious for the country . " Chase nodded . " I , too , feel the same way . " But Chase left the matter at that . Ile was not about to confide to General McDowell his own total lack of faith in the President , whom fate had selected to shatter forever the Union and delay , perhaps for a generation , the abolition of slavery. 298 GORE VIDAL L I N C O L N 299FOUR0 L D EDWARD did not stir from his chair as David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to the left , " said the doorkeeper . " Yes , Mr. McManus . " David crossed the entrance hall as slowly as he dared . He had never seen so much activity in the Mansion . Men in shirt-sleeves were arranging floral wreaths over the doors . Trestle tables were being set up in the state dining room . Silver and plate were being uncrated by an army of waiters . As David climbed the stairs , a dozen naval officers descended . The second-floor corridor was crowded , and David could see John Hay at the far end , looking into the waiting room . The other secretary was sick in bed . At Thompson 's , the health of the Mansion 's residents was much discussed . Currently , the two children were ill ; and David had been entrusted with their medicine . Keckley received him in the room where the oldest boy , Willie , lay . Mrs. Lincoln sat beside the bed . She did not look up as David entered , but continued to talk in a low voice to the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " Keckley took the package from David . " Anything else I can fetch you ? " asked David , admiring the loops of material that hung most royally from the posters of the bed , rather the way they had hung in the play Cleopatra , one of his favorites . " No . That 's all . " Keckley reached into her apron pocket and gave him a coin . As David made his way down the stairs , he passed the head groundsman , John Watt , going up them . " Good morning , Mr. Watt . " " Good morning , David . " Watt was an amiable man , well-disposed to the Confederacy . He was also said to be one of the richest men in Washingtonbecause of his shrewd management of the White House grounds , which he regarded as his own private plantation . All Washington knew of Watt 's arrangements to sell produce to a half-dozen restaurants and hotels , including Willard 's and Wormley 's . Over the years , attempts had been made to get rid of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David . To Mary , Watt was a comfort . She received him in the upstairs oval sitting room . " How are the boys , ma'am ? " Mary knew that Watt genuinelyliked Willie and Tad ; played with them by the hour ; taught them to ride and shoot . " It 's the fever . " Mary frowned . " I do n't wonder . This house is so cold . I think they are better , sir . Oh , I wish I could call off this reception ! " Mary did indeed regret the inexorable nature of her first reception in the entirely refurnished and repaired Executive Mansion . Tonight was intended to be her justification to the world for the money that she had spent . Certainly , never in the history of the Mansion had the state rooms been so gloriously decorated . She had seen to that . She had also made an innovation which had , by and large , been much praised : instead of opening the rooms to anyone who chose to come look at the President , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . She had also eschewedthe services of Washington 's ubiquitous Gautier and sent for New York 's finest chef and caterer , M. Maillard . But now both boys were ill ; and the Chevalier Wikoff was locked up in the basement of the Old Capitol prison ; and she needed money . As always , Watt was understanding . " In President Buchanan 's time , we often used the stationery fund for . . . other uses . " " I know . " Mary was hard . " I have asked Mr. Hay for some of it . He has said , no . " Hardly a day passed now without some sort of scene between Mary and one or the other of the President 's secretaries . Stoddard tried to be helpful but he was no match for Nicolay and Hay . " It 's always Mr. Hay , is n't it , ma'am ? " Watt looked grim , and chewed the ends of his moustache . " He 's in league with Major French  --  against us . Mary did not entirely appreciate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her only ally in the Mansion was Watt . Periodically , efforts were made to get rid of him as well as of his wife , a stewardess on the Mansion 's payroll . So far , Mary had been able to rout their common enemies . Now Watt wanted to counterattack . " After all , why should you allow a mere boy to tell you what you may or may not do with White House funds ? Funds which are almost never used for what they 're supposed to be used for because of the way the times change while the wording of the old appropriations do n't . " " I 've always thought Mr. Hay was stealing the funds for the horses ' feed . " Although , it was Watt who had put the idea in Mary 's mind , she had since made it her own . " I know that he was supposed to pay the supplier directly , but never did . I shall bring charges ! " " I would n't do that , ma'am . " Watt was cautious . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit more rope . " Watt stood up . " One way to get some money quick and easy is to sack one of the stewards and then you yourself can collect his salary which will keep on coming every month . " Mary was astonished at the simplicity of this plan . " I can do that ? " 300 GORE VIDAL 30ILINCOLN " Miss Harriett Lane did it all the time when she was mistress here . " Mary saw the vista beginning to brighten . " I shall see to that , Mr. Watt . Thank you , sir . " Mary drew a letter from her reticule . " You remember Mr. Waterman , whom we met in New York City last fall ? " Watt nodded . " A very rich man , they say . And most loyal to you and the President . " " See that this gets to him . " Mary gave Watt the letter . " I do n't want it sent from the White House . " " I 'll get it to him by courier , ma'am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . It was good to have one friend at least . But Watt had something on his mind . " I 've been to Old Capitol prison , " he said . " How is he ? " " They 've practically got him in chains . He 's in a sort of closet . . . " " This is all Mr. Seward 's doing ! God , that man is vile ! " " Yes , ma'am , he is . Five days from now , Mr. Wikoff will go back before the House Judiciary Committee . They will ask him how he got a copy of the President 's message . " Mary began , faintly , to see a corona of flame around Watt 's head . Could this be The Headache ? " He will not answer them , will he ? " " I do n't know , Mrs. Lincoln . But I think that you should speak to the President . " The flames flared like the sun during an eclipse . " I can not , sir . " But Seward could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feet on the writing desk , a handkerchief in his left hand which he used to rub ink from the fingers of his right hand . He had spent the morning signing military commissions , an endless task made even more disagree- able by a singularly oily paper that resisted ink . Seward paced the office , as if it were his own . " Anyway , Dan managed to get the Committee so enraged that they 're now threatening to bring charges against him , for contempt of Congress , and throw him into the Old Capitol , too . " " It would appear that General Sickles was not the best of all possible defense attorneys . " Lincoln stared , thoughtfully , at Seward . " Why did you pick him ? " " Mr. Wikoff chose him . " Seward was prompt . " But I trust Dan . He 's loyal . He 's clever . He 's popular in Congress . . . " " So popular that they are about to lock him up ? And just think what that will do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Lincoln threw down his handkerchief . " When does Wikoff testify ? " " February tenth . " " What will he say ? " " What he has already said , that he is sworn to secrecy . " Lincoln sighed . " That will not do , Mr. Seward . That will not do at all . " " Then should he name someone ? " Lincoln nodded . " I think he will have to , unless we can arrange something with the Committee , to get them to drop the matter . " Seward felt the slight voluptuous tingle that always preceded , nowadays , any exercise of inherent powers . " I believe you could , simply , order them to drop the investigation ; and they would have to comply . " " I suppose I could . But then we 'd never hear the end of it . No , we must find a way to approach the chairman of the Committee . " Seward and Lincoln discussed in considerable and unflattering detail the character of one John Hickman , a Pennsylvania politician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fierce abolitionist Republican but the sworn enemy of all moderates , beginning with the President . It was agreed that Seward would try to involve Thaddeus Stevens in the affair . Meanwhile , every effort must be made to get from Wikoff the truth . " Because , " Lincoln said , " he plainly stole the message . Now since that is a crime , he pretends that he was given it , which is not a crime . But by his silence , he indicates that the giver of the message was Mrs. Lincoln , which makes her the criminal . But she did not give it to him . I am certain of that . So either he will have to confess to theft  --  and I to carelessness  --  or he must tell us who it was that really gave him the message . " Seward said , " I think I have an idea . " " Good . But do n't tell it to me . I 'm not made for secrets . " Seward smiled . Actually , he had never known a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself the direction that he planned to take in some great enterprise . On the other hand , Lincoln tended to be quite free with the secrets of others . Seward paused at the door . " How are the boys ? " " The fever lingers . Willie is particularly weak . I hate the winter here , " he added , as if that somehow explained the darkness of the times . Seward said good-bye , and left through the door into the Cabinet Room , avoiding the usual mass of supplicants . He was reasonably certain that Mrs. Lincoln was the guilty party . He was also certain that there was an interesting way out of the imbroglio , one in which a number of birds might crash to earth as the result of a single flung stone . MARY HAD CEASED to think of Wikoff . She trusted Watt 's ingenuity . More to the point , the whole world had now been concentrated into302 GORE V I D A La single pier glass , in which she was at last able to see the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror reflected a white satin gown , trimmed with black Chantilly lace . There was a yard-long train . Shoulders and arms were bare , in imitation of the French empress ; and , wonder of wonders , she did not for once look to herself to possess any more than a mere sufficiency of flesh . A white-and-black wreath of crepe myrtle crowned her head . She was unmistakably the Republican Queen . " It is beautiful , " said Keckley , a shadow in the mirror behind her that was now joined by a taller , thinner shadow . " Well , our cat has a long tail tonight . " Mary turned , smiling , to greet her husband , still in his shirt-sleeves . Lincoln picked up the long train ; and whistled . " Father , it is the latest style . " Lincoln stared at her low-cut dress and shook his head . " I 'd be happier if more of the tail was up there at the neck , and less on the floor . " " I do n't advise you about generals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , then , if I do , you never listen to me ; so I 'll not listen to you . " " I suppose that is a fair trade .

" " What does the doctor say ? " Lincoln proceeded to pull on his coat , with Keckley 's aid . " All is well , he says . But this ague is a new one , he says , not like the others . I wish , " said Mary , staring at her reflection as if it were that of someone else , " there was some way of cancelling all of this , so that I can look after the boys .

" " Mr. Seward says we should be in half mourning for Prince Albert . That 's how it 's done , among us sovereigns . " Lincoln laughed . " Well , I reckon we are sort of temporary ramshackle sovereigns at that . " " Speak for yourself , Father . Ramshackle ! " Keckley fastened Mary 's pearl necklace at the back . Then Mary turned , sweeping her train with her left hand while with her right she took her husband 's arm . " I think it 's time , Father . " 303There was a fanfare from the Marine Band as they appeared at the head of the stairs . Then they descended to the strains of " Hail to the Chief . " The East Room was as splendid as Mary had dreamed that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatic corps were lined up to the right of the entrance , gold and silver braid glittering , while , to the left , were the military and the politicians and the crinolined ladies in all their jewels . Mary 's sharp eye noticed that Mrs. Crittenden was laden with diamonds like an Eastern idol , while Miss Chase wore mode-colored silk and no jewels at all . As the President and Mrs. Lincoln made their stately circuit of the room , many of the ladies curtseyed at their appearance ; and all the diplomatsbowed low . We are sovereigns , thought Mary contentedly ; and not so ramshackle as all that . In the center of the room , they stopped . To the President 's left stood a military aide and the chief of protocol from the State Department , ready to announce each of the guests . For once , Mary knew them all ; or at least their names . The French princes were the first to pay their respects ; then the diplomatic corps , according to seniority , filed past . Suddenly , a slender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " Mr. President , I wonder if you remember me ? I 'm your son , Robert . " Lincoln blinked his eyes ; gave a slow smile ; lifted his left gloved hand and gave the boy a slight cuff on the cheek . " That 's enough of that , " he said . From the next room , the Marine Band played a polka , to which no one could dance that night . Robert bowed to Mary , who gave him a low curtsey . She noted how he had entirely grown up in the year that he had been at Harvard . He was self-contained , strong-willed and somewhat shy ; more Todd than Lincoln . He wanted to join the army . Although she had , thus far , successfully forbidden it , she lived in terror that one day Lincoln would let the boy do what he wanted . Lately , the newspapers had begun to speculate on the eventual military status of the Prince of Rails .

" Madam President , we seem delayed , " said McClellan , plainly enjoying the mismanagement . L I N C O L N304 GORE V I D A L " Oh , but we shall advance , sir , soon enough .

From behind them , a voice cried out the words of a recent newspaper editorial , " An advance to the front is only retarded by the imbecility of commanders ! ' " There was a good deal of laughter , and the Young Napoleoncarefully joined in . Lincoln looked down at McClellan and said , " I hope , General , they do n't mean the Commander-in-Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Your Excellency . " A key was found and the doors were opened . At the center of the state dining room , Maillard had created a fountain , supported by water nymphs of nougat and surrounded by marzipan beehives filled with marzipan bees , producing charlotte russe . Elsewhere , venison , pheasant , duck and wild turkey were displayed , while an enormous Japanese bowl contained ten gallons of champagne punch . Just back of the punch bowl , Seward and his diplomatic cronies Schleiden and Stoeckl stationed themselves and conspicuously made up for the abstinence of so many of the principal figures of the still essentially rural and pious republic . Then Dan Sickles approached ; and Seward drew him to one side , to inquire of Wikoff . " He 's very uncomfortable . So he 's apt to say anything , just to get out of the Old Capitol . " Sickles twirled his moustaches . " He asked for my old cell . But he was refused . " " Have you seen Hickman ? " Sickles grimaced . " Not very likely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contempt of Congress . Do you know John Watt ? " Seward looked surprised . " The head groundsman ? " Sickles nodded . " I 've been talking to Major French about him . It seems that he 's been robbing the White House ever since the days of President Pierce . Years ago , French tried to get rid of him but Watt always covers his tracks . Now he 's working pretty close with Madam . " " I see . " Seward began to see a great many things all at once ; and the vista was ominous indeed . " Major French has some sort of . . . evidence ? " " Yes . " Sickles dipped his crystal cup straight into the punch bowl to the horror of Mrs. Gideon Welles  --  a New England virago , in Seward 's prejudiced view . " He has enough evidence to send John Watt to prison for larceny , both petty and grand . " " Well , I like them both , Dan . Particularly together . This is solid evi-dence ? " " Solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she . . . ? " Seward looked across the room . Mrs. Lincoln was holding court to Sumner and Trumbull and the French princes . LINCOLN 305 " No , she 's not involved . At least not in what Major French showed me . On the other hand , when she took Watt to New York with her , it is said he helped her raise money for herself from ... " " That 's only said , ' Dan . " Seward was peremptory . He had his own sources of information in New York . Mrs. Lincoln had more than once begged money from businessmen . She had also promised political favors to at least one known enemy of the Administration . In Seward 's privilegedposition as the unofficial chief censor of the United States , he had read a good deal of Mrs. Lincoln 's correspondence . But since Seward regarded information as the source of all political power , he was not about to discuss any of this with Sickles . " Do you think we can put Mr. Watt in jail ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor , legally . " Sickles added with a grin . " I do n't like your tone , Dan . I get the impression that you may possibly , in unpatriotic moments , suspect that due to the present danger to the Union , I sequester the innocent out of malice or even mad caprice . " " Governor , I 'd never hint such a thing . " " Even so , I feel it , Dan . It 's in the air . Something unspoken . But then I am an uncommonly sensitive man , as you know . I writhe under the lash of criticism ... " " ... as do the editors you lock up for lashing you ... " " . . . pro bono publico . " Seward was enjoying himself . He was also beginning to see a way out of the dilemma . " It was Mr. Watt who gave the Chevalier Wikoff the President 's message . " " Why ? " Sickles began the cross-examination . " Because Mr. Watt was on a retainer from the Herald ... " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall modify the evidence . Out of friendship , he gave the Chevalier ... " " He ca n't give anyone the President 's property . That 's theft . " Seward nodded . " I have n't done a cross-examination in years , as you can see . Well , then , Mr. Watt happened to see a copy of the message lying on a table , as who did not ? Since he has a perfect memory , can visualize page after page of Holy Writ at a single glance , he memorized certain passages from the message and then , out of friendship to the Chevalier and mistaken devotion to the President , he recited the passages to Wikoff , who wrote them down and sent them to the Herald . " Sickles finished the punch in one long swallow . " I think , Governor , that I 've restored you to your old brilliance as a trial lawyer , who is never surprised by what his client says . " 306 GORE VIDAL " Yes , " said Seward , thoughtfully . " But Mr. Watt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be if he knows that Major French means to bring charges against him and that I can get those charges dropped if he confesses to having told Wikoff about the message . " " What is to stop Major French from charging him anyway ? " asked Seward . " Mrs. Lincoln . The President . I do n't think that Major French is so zealous to see justice done as he is anxious to see Mr. Watt gone from this place . " Seward patted Sickles 's shoulder . " You have threaded the eye of the needle . " " Like a rich man ? Or a camel ? " " It is the camel that passes through each time , But so boundless is the Lord 's mercy , even the rich man may find salvation . " Twice , during the dinner , Mary visited the boys . She found Keckley seated beside Willie , who was asleep ; he was breathing heavily but normally . Mary touched his face : the fever lingered . " The crisis should have come , " she said . Keckley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly with this kind of fever , which the doctor says is new to him . " Lincoln joined them . " There is no difference , " said Mary . Lincoln 's huge hand rested , gently , on Willie 's face , quite covering it . " He is no worse , " he said . " That is something . " " Call the doctor . . . " Mary began , but Keckley shook her head . " Let them be for the night . Let them sleep . You two go back to your business . " Lincoln smiled . " Well , at least you know what it is we do down there . In spite of the music and all , there is no party or pleasure in this house , ever . Only business . " Mary wondered whether or not her husband knew that eighty of those that she had invited had refused to come because they thought it frivolous in time of war to celebrate , or as the truly evil Ben Wade had scribbled on his card of invitation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are the President and Mrs. Lincoln aware that there is a civil war ? If they are not , Mr. and Mrs. Wade are , and for that reason decline to participate in feasting and dancing . " Despite the feasting , the Civil War continued ; and , twelve days later , John Hay sat with the President in Secretary Stanton 's office at the War Department , and waited anxiously for dispatches . Apparently , McClellan had taken to heart Lincoln 's insistence on the importance of East Tennessee . Buell 's army had won an engagement at Mill Springs in Kentucky , while elements of I lalleck 's army , which had been permanently settled inLINCOLN 307Missouri , as Lincoln had despairingly put it , were now on the move . An Illinois brigadier-general , Ulysses S. Grant , had then captured Fort Henry on the Tennessee River . He was now at the Cumberland River , twelve miles away , laying siege to Fort Donelson . If Donelson were to fall , Nashville and eastern Tennessee would once more be a part of the Union . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was repulsed . On February 16 , as Lincoln and Stanton and Hay had been studying the map of Tennessee , a telegram from Halleck at St. Louis was brought them : Grant had refused to come to terms with the Confederate General Buckner . " No terms except unconditional , immediate surrender can be accepted , " Grant had told the rebels . " I propose to move immediately upon your works . " When this message had been read aloud by the wheezing Stanton , Lincoln had said , with wonder , " Can this be one of our generals ? " " Yes , sir . And he 's crazy to be where he is . " Stanton had held his chest as if to push all the air out  --  or hold it in . Hay was never sure which . " Buell ca n't come to his aid . The roads are impassable , all mud . Now he faces Fort Donaldson ... " " Donelson , " Lincoln had said , peering at the spot on the map . But the next day in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Union 's first true victory of the war . General Grant 's message to General Halleck was read aloud by Stanton , whose wheezing had abruptly ceased . " We have taken Fort Donelson , and from twelve to fifteen thousand prisoners . ' " Stanton turned to Lincoln , " Will you announcethis , sir , to the people in the reception room ? " " No , Mr. Stanton . I leave that pleasure to you . You 've deserved it . " So it was Stanton who opened the door to the anteroom , where some fifty army officers and newspaper writers were gathered . When Stanton read them Grant 's telegram , there was cheering . Then Stanton proposed three proper cheers for General Grant , and the entire War Department resounded with the noise . Hay saw two rats hurry from the anteroom into the relative quiet of the Secretary 's office . A moment later , McClellan and his glittering foreign aides swept into the reception room . To Hay 's astonishment , McClellan was roundly cheered . Then , with quiet modesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a writer from the Washington Star was taking down every word . McClellan had noticed the same thing ; he spoke slowly and deliberately . " In a moment , I shall join President Lincoln in the office of the Secretary of War . I shall report to him what you already know . In little more than a week , the Union has won five decisive victories . " There was more cheering at this ; and the Count of Paris picked his nose , lost in3o8 GORE VIDALthought . " I , personally , was able to give each commander his orders for each day in five separate parts of the country , thanks to the miracle of the telegraph . Modern warfare has now come of age . Little did Alexander or Caesar or . . . Napoleon , " the head lowered a moment , a frown creased the youthful brow ; he did indeed resemble the Young Napoleon  --  the Third , thought Hay , sourly , " suspect that one day a great general could conduct a war on five  --  on fifty different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly as if he were face-to-face with his commanders in the field . Today eastern Tennessee is ours . Tomorrow . . . Virginia , and peace ! " In an ecstasy of cheering , McClellan , alone , entered Stanton 's office . Hay shut the door behind him . Lincoln looked amused ; bemused , as well . " I must congratulate you , General , for putting a fire under Halleck . I thought he was frozen solid there in St. Louis . " " It was not easy , let me tell you , Your Excellency . " As always , Hay wondered if McClellan knew how much this title annoyed the President ; and if he knew , as how could he not , why did he persist , except to mock Lincoln to his face ? McClellan marched up and down the room explaining his Western strategy , while Stanton wheezed and fumed ; and , finally , intervened . " General , you can take a lot of credit , of course . But you did announce to the press that Fort Donelson had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fort . " " A minor misunderstanding , Mr. Stanton , nothing more . " Hay wondered if there was a fraying of the friendship between McClellan and Stanton  --  or what everyone had been led to believe was a friendship . Lately , Stanton had been even more irritated by McClellan 's slowness than Lincoln . Of course , Stanton 's usual state was one of irritability . But then he worked harder than any man that Hay had ever known . He was also said to be as resolutely honest in business dealings as he was totally treacherous in personal ones . Could it be , Hay wondered , that now that the friendship with McClellan had served its purpose and Stanton had been made Secretary of War , a division between them was bound to take place ? Particularly , if McClellan failed to prosecute the war with the sort of vigor that Stanton fiercely demanded and Lincoln somewhat wistfully desired . After further tributes to his own exploits by proxy in the West , McClellanspoke of what was now the agreed-on strategy in Virginia . When McClellan had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plans for the taking of Richmond by water , Lincoln had vetoed the enterprise . It would be far better  --  and safer , said the President  --  toseize Manassas ; and cut the lines of communication between the north and the south , as well as the east and the west , of the Confederacy while maintaining the defense of Washington , which would , otherwise , be at the mercy of the rebels should the Army of the Potomac be shifted to the lower end of Chesapeake Bay . But , gradually , against his better judgment , Lincoln had given way to McClellan . " Now , Your Excellency , we are ready to move . All we need is your order to provide us with ships to transport the army south . " McClellan 's right hand had found its way , irresistibly , into his tunic . Then , legs wide apart , he stared at the President , who was now leaning against the wall , carefully flattening first one shoulder blade and then the other in a rocking motion that indicated to Hay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall see to the order , of course . And now , with these victories in the West , we should be able to close most swiftly the circle of death . . . of victory , I mean . . . " Lincoln 's voice trailed off . Hay had almost never seen the Tycoon lose his train of thought . But in the last few days Lincoln had been unusually distracted by the illnesses of Willie and Tad , the business of Wikoff and Congress , the constant tension with McClellan . " Halleck wants more men in the West , " said Stanton , eyeing Lincoln curiously . " He also wants a unified command , under himself . " " We can not spare the men , " said McClellan promptly . " Certainly not on the eve of what is about to be the final engagement of the war . As for a unified command in the West ... " " I shall address myself to that presently , " said Lincoln , picking up his hat from its place on Stanton 's desk . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stanton 's eyes filled suddenly with tears ; he was no longer the ferocious master of endless detail . " We are fearful . He took the vaccine well enough the first day . But now there are hideous eruptions all over his body . " " How old is he ? " " Six months . He is christened James . " " They can be surprisingly strong at that age . " " So we pray . And yours ? " " I do not know . " Lincoln turned , bleakly , to McClellan . " We shall speak in a few days , about your ships . " " Yes , Your Excellency . " Hay held the door for Lincoln , who passed through , eyes on the floor . This was sometimes a deliberate tactic in order not to see those who wanted to be seen by him ; but today the Ancient seemed to want to be invisible  --  even gone. 3 1 0 GORE V I D A LAt the door to the White House , Old Edward said , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's with the boy . " " Is the doctor here ? " Old Edward paused . Then he nodded : " Yes , sir . In point of fact , he is . " Lincoln ran up the stairs like a man half his age . Hay turned to Old Edward , who said , " Madam told me I was not to distress him . But when he asked about the doctor ... " " How is the boy ? " " Oh , Mr. Hay , he is dying ! Ca n't you feel it in the house ? Like a cold wind . " Mary sat holding Willie 's hand . Keckley stood behind her , as if prepared , in turn , to hold her hand . The doctor was trying to get Willie to take medicine ; but the boy 's mouth was firmly shut . He was conscious ; but seemed too weary from the struggle to speak . As Lincoln approached , Willie tried to smile . The doctor took advantage of this sign of life and got the spoonful of medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how well he is doing ? " Mary had now held back her own tears for so long that she wondered if some part of her might not , presently , drown . " I do . I do . " Lincoln sat on the bed and , lightly , ruffled the boy 's hair . " You 'll be down for the parade next week . General McClellan 's holding a review , just for us . A hundred thousand soldiers , he says . About the biggest parade that 's ever been held in the world . " Willie nodded ; swallowed hard to get down the medicine ; shut his eyes . Lincoln looked at Mary across the bed . She turned her head to one side . She had been young when Eddie left them . She had been able to have more sons ; and did . But she was not young now ; and never again would there be anyone in her life resembling Willie , for of all the children he was the one who was closest to her , the one that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , old and widowed and forlorn , save for him . Now she saw an image of herself , as clear and precise as the freshest daguerreotype ; saw herself old , widowed , forlorn  --  and quite alone . Lincoln turned to the doctor , who spread his hands , as if letting Willie go . Then Nicolay appeared in the doorway ; and motioned to Lincoln , who left the room . Mary preferred to be alone with Willie . The enormity of her grief was as unique and as unshareable as it would be at the end of her own days . Seward apologized to the President . " At such a time . . . " He shook his head . " At such a time , at such a time . . . " Lincoln stared into the burning coals of the grate . " I can not believe that he is going . " " He is not gone yet . " " No . " Lincoln 's sigh was close to a moan . Seward had never seen the President so  --  unlike himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself again ; or a fair facsimile . " Let 's get down to it . You have spoken to Mr. Hickman ? " " Yes , sir . We have all spoken to him . He has been studying Watt 's testimony ; and he does not believe it . " " How can he disprove it ? " Lincoln straightened the painting of Jackson above the mantel . " I doubt if he can . But he told me that he intends to hold hearings . Wikoff will be questioned again and again , and so will John Watt , not the happiest witness that I have ever dealt with . Hickman also tells me that the Committee will call other witnesses . " " I see . " Lincoln turned around , his face suddenly harsh . " He will call Mrs. Lincoln . " " Yes . " " Well , Governor , you and I are going to pay Mr. Hickman a call . " " But he 's at the Capitol now ... " " So ? This is not England , where the sovereign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can wander in and out of the Capitol as I please . " Seward was alarmed . " Is this wise , sir ? What if the press should discover that you had gone before a committee . . . ? " " We 'll take our chances . " At Stanton 's insistence , the President 's carriage was now always accom- panied by a company of cavalry . " I feel like a parade , " said Lincoln , as the carriage and its escort clattered loudly down Pennsylvania Avenue . " You feel what ? " asked Seward. " . . . like a parade , " shouted Lincoln . " When Mother and I go driving we ca n't even talk , for all the noise . " At the Capitol , the President and Seward were received by a very surprised Sergeant-at-arms , who ushered them into the vast gilded office reserved for the Speaker of the House . A moment later , Mr. Hickman joined them . He was a smiling , hard man . " Well , sir , this is quite an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hand . " Indeed it is , " said Seward , lighting his cigar , as if to emphasize that he was in some not entirely polite establishment . " I understand , " said Lincoln , " that you do not accept Mr. Watt 's testi- mony that it was he who told Mr. Wikoff about my message to Congress . " " Well , sir , I find it hard to believe that he would have so good a memory for something that he had only looked at , very briefly , once , or so he told us . " I , " said Seward , " in my youth , could learn some thirty legal citations in the space of half an hour . " " But you , Mr. Seward , are one of the great lawyers of the age . You are not a professional gardener . " " Actually , the law can be approached as if it were a kind of garden , " said Seward . " You must recall where and when you plant each seed ... " Lincoln raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept the story , Mr. Hickman , and I  --  not you  --  am , in this case , the plaintiff since the message in question was mine . " " In a sense , sir , that is true . But this is wartime , and we must be ever-vigilant , all of us , you at your end of Pennsylvania Avenue and we at ours . " Seward started to speak ; but then chose to cough instead . Lincoln spoke : " The Congress , Mr. Hickman , has every right to question the official actions of the Executive , but I do not see this as an official matter . If I choose to lodge a complaint , I would do so through a civil court , as would you if you were robbed , which I was not . " " Naturally , sir , we here take a different view . Should there be Confederatespies at large in the White House , surely we would be negligent in our duties not to find them . " " Mr. Hickman , " Seward was growing annoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the armies and to the Secretary of State . Surely , Congress is not about to set itself up over General McClellan and me , and go searching for spies on its own , without the means to apprehend them ? " Hickman continued to smile . " Mr. Seward , the Constitution does , in a sense , put us over you . Certainly , it puts us , collectively , on the same level as the President . Of course , we ca n't  --  or we do n't  --  hire our own detectivesas you do , but we can question suspicious personages , and we have the power to jail them , if we choose . " " Mr. Hickman . " Lincoln 's voice was mild ; but his expression was remoteand cold and , to Seward 's now experienced eye , chilling . " I want you to send for all of the Republican members of the Judiciary Committee . I 'd like to speak to them . " Hickman 's smile began , slightly , to fade . " But the Committee 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's here in the Capitol or on the floor or gone home . . . " " Tell the Sergeant-at-arms to fetch us as many Republican members of the Committee as he can rustle up . " " But , Mr. President . . . " " Now , " said Lincoln . Hickman left the room . Lincoln looked at Seward ; then , suddenly , h ( smiled . " You know , Governor , all of this reminds me of the time wher I was out on circuit , back in ' thirty-nine . . . " As Lincoln told his story the members of the Judiciary Committee began to assemble . Seward ad. mired the skillful way that Lincoln kept drawing out the story so that , b ) the time the Committee was all assembled , he could conclude it to mud laughter . The half-dozen representatives now circled the President like so man ) Lilliputians , thought Seward , about to tie up Gulliver . Hickman threw the first rope . " Gentlemen , this is highly irregular , of course , for a presiden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , " the smile was agair in place , " these are irregular times . " " So they are , Mr. Hickman . " Lincoln was the soul of amiability . " Gen tlemen , we are all of us , I hope , patriots . We are also , all of us , Republicans The two need not be the same thing but we must act as if they are . " Then was a nervous laugh from one member ; and total silence from the rest " Now I am , for better or worse , the head of the Republican Party , whose majority in Congress is considerable . I know that there are some whc think I am a usurper , and that Governor Seward here is the true head o our party , but he 'll be the first to tell you that that is not so . Or he hat better be the first . " With that , Lincoln detonated genuine laughter ant Seward 's laugh was loudest of all since there was nothing in this for hin to laugh at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader  --  and President  --  to tell yoi that I believe John Watt 's story , and that I want you to believe it , too Otherwise , in the middle of a war which we are only , this very day beginning to win  --  Fort Donelson has fallen ... " There were spontaneous cheers from all but Hickman. " ... you will deeply embarrass me personally if you persist in allowing every sort of gossip and troublemaker and secret secessionist to use you committee to make newspaper sensations . You will damage our brand new political party . You will put at risk our majority in this House corn November 's election . Finally , you will give great comfort to the rebels a the South . Well , I am telling you what you can do . But I know that yoi will not do it , because I know that I can count on you  --  as Republican and as Unionists  --  to do the right thing . " Seward admired Lincoln 's unexpected mastery of what was , in princi ple , a hostile group . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too vague to describe a former Democrat turned Jacobin aboli tionist like Hickman or a former Whig moderate like himself  --  or th President , for that matter. 314 GORE VIDAL LINCOLN 315Finally , Hickman said , " You guarantee , sir , that Watt 's story is true ? " " Oh , Mr. Hickman , I guarantee nothing on this earth that I 've not experienced firsthand , and even then the sharpest eye can fail you . I think Watt 's testimony is true . I also think that there will never be a story more interesting , nor to the dramatic extent that some would like . " Seward saw that Hickman was furious but there was nothing now that he could do . Lincoln 's reminder to the Committee members that they would be up for reelection in nine months ' time had neatly done the trick . To damage mortally the leader of their party would so help the busy Democrats that a number of those present might be abruptly removed from public life . " Thank you , Mr. President , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lincoln was now shaking each congressman 's hand . " Thank you , Mr. Chairman , for letting me drop in on you like this . Or to quote the preacher who said ... " AS MARY HURRIED down the corridor to Willie 's bedroom , Watt suddenly stepped in front of her , as if he 'd materialized from nowhere like a ghost . Mary cried out with surprise ; and some alarm . Watt was pale and grim . " Mrs. Lincoln , " he began . " Mr. Watt , no one 's supposed to be in this part of the Mansion . My boy is very ill ... " " I know . I 'm sorry . I did what I was told to do . I did what they forced me to do . " " I 'm sorry , Mr. Watt . I ca n't talk now . " At the far end of the corridor , she saw Nicolay , watching her with some curiosity . " My wife has just given up her job as stewardess . I have resigned as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the army . But it was revoked today . I shall go off the payroll at the end of the month . Now , I have done everything that I could ... " " Mr. Watt , you will always have a friend in me , as well as in our common friends at New York City . The greenhouse that you have always dreamed of , the one that we saw in Fourteenth Street , is available ... " Mary spoke rapidly ; and to the point . She had rehearsed this speech before . She told Watt that she was grateful to him for his support ; and that she would repay him . When Mary had finished , Watt gave a little bow . Mary tried but failed to smile . Then she crossed into Willie 's room , where one of his playmates was seated solemnly beside the great bed . Willie 's eyes were shut . " Has he spoken ? " The boy shook his head . " But he recognizes me sometimes . He squeezes my hand a little . " Mary sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plainly comforted Willie in his rare conscious moments . Mary now had the sense that she was dreaming ; and that she had been dreaming for quite some time . Soon she would wake up and all would be well . They would be back in Springfield ; and she would report , over breakfast , her nightmare that Lincoln had been elected President and that the Union had been dissolved and that Willie was dead  --  no , dying  --  no , alive  --  still . That morning the doctor had said that there was no longer anything to be done . But that was the way things were in nightmares , and she was an expert on dreams and their significance . Dreams work mainly in opposites , she knew . Willie dying meant Willie thriving . Finally , it was Keckley who told Hay that he should fetch the President from the War Department . When the cries from the living quarters of the Mansion had begun , Nicolay ordered everyone out of the waiting room and told Old Edward to stand guard at the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the War Department , where he found Lincoln in Stanton 's office . Since Nashville was about to be part of the Union , Lincoln had spent the morning working on a statement welcoming East Tennessee back into the Union . But when he saw Hay in the doorway , he let the papers in his hand fall to the floor . Stanton looked at Lincoln , somewhat irritably ; looked at Hay , and understood . Stanton began to choke from asthma . Lincoln stood up , his eyes on Hay , who could not speak . Lincoln nodded , and Hay was relieved that he had not been obliged to tell the Ancient that the boy was dead . The Mansion was silent . Hay assumed that Mrs. Lincoln had been drugged by now . Certainly , no one could have endured much longer her cries , which were neither screams nor sobs but an eerie keening , addressed to the underworld itself ; to that voracious darkness which had robbed her yet again . Hay stood in the doorway and watched as Lincoln crossed to the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln pulled back the sheet . The boy 's eyes had been closed ; the hair combed . Delicately , with a forefinger , Lincoln touched his son 's brow . Keckley pushed a chair in place so that Lincoln might sit . As he lowered himself into the chair , Hay saw that the tears had begun to flow down leathery cheeks that looked as if they had never before known such moisture . " It is hard , " Lincoln whispered . " Hard to have him die . " Then Robert entered the room . Lincoln looked up at him , for a moment316 GORE VIDAL disoriented . " The doctor has given her morphine . She is asleep . " Lincoln looked back at Willie . Robert started to go to his father ; but then thought better of it . He left the room . Lincoln addressed the dead boy , in a voice that was oddly conversa- tional . " We loved you so . " In tears , Hay left the room , bumping into Robert , who said , urgently , " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can you telegraph her ? " Hay blew his nose ; and used that gesture as an excuse to dry his eyes . " Of course . Which aunt ? " " Elizabeth Edwards . She is the best with Mother . You must tell her to start today . Because if she does n't ... " " If she does n't , what ? " " If she does n't , my mother will go mad . " FIVE A S CHASE held out his mug to receive the fresh coffee , the ship gave a sudden leap and the coffee came toward him , slowly , it seemed to Chase , making an arc from spout to what was no longer cup but his own unprotected face . Fortunately , a second shudder of the ship caused the jet of coffee to avoid his cheek ; even so , he could feel its warmth , as it made its way to the deck with a splash not entirely drowned out by the sound of water cascading off the Treasury cutter 's bow . Chase looked down the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one hand while in the other he held a fork that had been aimed at a plate which was now skittering along the table , depositing its contents impartially between the lap of Stanton and that of General Viele . Once the mess-boy was certain that all of the coffee had left the tin pot , he put it down on the table , where , as waves again struck the ship 's bow , the pot retraced the course of the presidential plate and struck Lincoln full in the chest . " I do n't think , " said the First Magistrate , thoughtfully , " that I 'm all that hungry , anyway . " - The commanding officer of the Miami apologized . " I 'm sorry , sir . It should n't be this rough . But you never know with the Chesapeake . " " How much longer , " gasped Stanton , " before we are at Fortress Monroe ? " " By eight this evening , sir . " Stanton shut his eyes . Lincoln smiled , wanly . Chase felt vigorous ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutter of the U.S. Treasury , and the President and the Secretary of War were his honored guests . Chase turned to the captain . " I 'm sure we 'll be able to do justice to this delicious meal that your cook has prepared for us , " he said , graciously ; then , to his alarm , he saw that a second mess-boy had appeared from the galley with a tureen of steaming soup . " But I would suggest that we forego the ... " A great wave broke over the bow ; and the soup was foregone . Happily , it missed the President , who was now the color of chalk . " I believe , " said Lincoln , " that I shall lie down for a while . " With the aid of the captain , the President lurched across the salon to a long locker on which a pallet had been placed . Here he stretched himself out and shut his eyes . Stanton staggered to his feet and hurled himself toward the mess-boy , who caught him in midflight , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gasping softly , eyes red-glazed behind the pebble glasses . " That seems to leave just us , General , " said Chase , cheerily , to Viele , who seemed at ease . As best they could , they dined . Meanwhile , the plate and cutlery had taken on a sinister life of their own . " Rather like a spiritualist 's seance , " Chase remarked . Lately , conversation with the dead had become the rage at Washington ; and the city was filled with mediums of all sorts . It was rumored that Mrs. Lincoln had summoned to the White House a particularly fashionable medium ; and that she had been able to speak to Willie , the only bright  --  or even sane , if gossip was to be believed  --  moment in her bereavement . The White House had been in deepest mourning ever since the child 's funeral , which had been held , three months earlier , in a storm so terrible that Chase had been put in mind of one of those Shakespeare plays where all the elements do conspire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  tragedy . General Viele discussed the previous month 's seizure of Fort Pulaski , just outside Savannah ; and Chase said that he only prayed that McClellan would be inspired by the numerous Federal victories all around the country ; and himself move . General Ben Butler had occupied New Orleans . General John Pope had seized a crucial island in the Mississippi River , known , somewhat ingloriously , as Island Number Ten . General Grant318GORE V I D A LLINCOLNhad sustained great losses  --  some thirteen thousand men when he was surprised by the rebels at Shiloh Church on the Tennessee River . Grant had managed , barely , to survive . Subsequently , he had been denounced by a former commandant of the United States Military Academy as a common gambler and drunkard . Lincoln had ignored the denunciation . But Lincoln could hardly ignore the denunciation of McClellan from the radicals in Congress ; and of himself and Stanton from the reviving Democratic Party in the North . When he had finally ordered McClellan and the Army of the Potomac into action , he took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could hardly corn- mand all the other armies while he himself was in the field . McClellan had accepted this loss of command with rather more serenity than Chase had anticipated . Halleck was given the Western command and , to please the radicals , Fremont was revived and given something called the Mountain Department . Between March 17 and April5 , 1862 , more than one hundred thousand Federal troops were moved by water down the Potomac River to the so-called Yorktown peninsula , a marshy strip of land between the York and the James rivers , dominated at its eastern tip by Fortress Monroe and at its center by Yorktown , that historic village where the War of Indepen- dence had been , finally , won  --  by the French fleet . Now the rebel troops occupied the remains of the British fortification at Yorktown . McClellan 's " Urbana plan " had been abandoned when , in a surprise movement , the Confederate Army had abandoned Manassas and Center- ville in order to regroup along the Rappahannock River , thus making it impossible for McClellan to effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that he would use Fortress Monroe as the center of his operations , first , against Yorktown ; then against West Point , some twenty-five miles southeast of Richmond ; and , finally , against Richmond itself . In a joint operation with the navy , under the command of Commodore Goldsborough , McClellan would now put a prompt end to the rebellion . Unfortunately , modern naval science had deranged McClellan 's plan . The Confederate navy had succeeded in raising a forty-gun Union frigate , sunk at the beginning of the war so that it might not fall into their hands . The frigate 's hull was then plated with metal , while a cast-iron ramrod was attached to its bow . On the morning of March 9 , this frigate  --  renamed the Merrimack  --  had sunk two Union ships in the Hampton Roads just ooff Norfolk , and had driven the Minnesota aground . Chase had never seen Stanton so entirely demoralized . " They will sink every Union ship in every Union harbor ! " Stanton had then sent word to the northern ports to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is no doubt , " he had said in a dramatic voice , " that this one ship will be able to destroy the city of Washington . " But , as Welles kept reminding them , a Union ship of equally radical design was on its way to the rescue . This curious flat metal ship had a revolving turret , containing cannon . On the evening of March 9 , the Monitor engaged the Merrimack in an inconclusive battle , which did not end until the Merrimackwithdrew to the safety of Norfolk harbor . Nevertheless , the fact that the Merrimack still existed made any sort of naval operation more than usually hazardous . McClellan had now laid siege to Yorktown . During April , he erected elaborate batteries with which to destroy the enemy 's fortifications . The expense of McClellan 's engineers alone had given Chase many a sleepless night . Although McClellan claimed to have only ninety-three thousand men , Chase believed that he had a hundred fifty-six thousand men . But no matter how many men he had , he was always certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elaborate preparation for a siege which had ended two days ago , when the Confederate Army simply abandoned Yorktown ; and it was then that Lincoln decided that the time had come for him to pay McClellan a visit . Thus far , the Army of the Potomac had taken only two Confederate strongholds  --  Manassas and Yorktown ; and each had been given up by the enemy . Worse , at Manassas , the famed , feared fortification turned out to be logs of wood painted black to resemble cannons . Side by side , Chase and General Viele clung to the ship 's railing , and watched the waves precede them ; the wind was leeward now . " We are making excellent speed , " said Chase , quietly expert  --  his cutter . " A summer storm . " Viele pointed to the dark receding clouds in the distance . " Weather 's fickle . " " It will , " said Chase , cocking an old salt 's eye at the pale sun , " still be light when we make landfall . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortunately , at sunset , the waters of the Chesapeake had grown as still as glass and the cutter was , thought the contented Chase , exactly like a painted ship upon a painted ocean . The President was now in good spirits . Although Stanton 's eyes were bothering him , even he was amiable , as they were helped from the cutter into a tug that would take them to Commodore Goldsborough 's flagship , the Minnesota . In absolute stillness , the tug came alongside the towering , **25;14742;TOOLONG 141all written by top literary figures who were paid enormous sums of money by magazine standards . She needed a new assistant art director , Linda Lafferty decided in desperation , someone fast and good who would be tough enough to speed things up . A lot of severe ass-kicking could do wonders to kill Maxi-lust , she thought , but something about being so tall made it almost impossible for her to kick ass effectively . She had n't decided if it was her desire to be liked or fear of killing someone , but at least she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she put her request to Carl Koch she was surprised at how quickly he agreed to let her hire a new top assistant . Although Savoir Vivre was clearly a money-machine , Koch , like most editors , did n't like to add any staff if he could help it . In her last job Linda had worked with a young man who was as single-mindedly work-oriented as he was brilliant . She had wanted to hire him for a long time and now Maxi Adams , queen of the rubber cement , Lorelei of paste-up , catnip sorceress of the ruler , was going to give her the opportunity to offer Rocco Cipriani a salary he could n't resist , for he had always said that only a lot of money could get him away from Conde Nast . Maxi Adams would serve a purpose , would make a contribution in spite of herself . Linda Lafferty looked at Rocco Cipriani severely . " I 'm taking a vacation . I have n't had one minute off since I came to Savoir Vivre . I wo n't be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to me about you and complaining . You 're going to be in absolute charge . They 'll all have memos to that effect . " " You want a new broom , mixed with Captain Queeg and a few flog-gings ? " " Precisely . There is n't one of my bums who 's doing a full day 's work . I have a major discipline problem on my hands . I 'm absolutely counting on you to beat and whack and knock them back into shape while I 'm away having that thirty-day nervous breakdown Carl said I was entitled to , and when I get back I want to be ahead of schedule . . . or else . " She had decided not to pinpoint Maxi as the source of the trouble . Let him find out for himself . On-the-job training . " You 're cute as hell , Linda , when you get threatening . " " That 's why I 've hired you , that 's why we 've spent all weekend going over this disgusting backload of undone work . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all cute . " " And I thought you liked me . " " You 're all right for a kid , " she said primly , cursing her never-give-up Irish lust that did n't have the good sense to stop raging at the sight of that young and completely untouchable Rocco Cipriani . She looked at him closely , trying to decide how any man so absurdly gorgeous could still command as much respect as he did . He had an indecent chaos of black curls , heavily hooded dark eyes that were both dreamy and glowing in their intensity , as well as the nose of a Medici prince . In his strong features , for all her acuteness , she could find no single fault . She did n't even dare to look at his mouth . A girl had only so much self-control . Everythingabout Rocco worked together , relentlessly , powerfully , insistently . It was difficult to turn away from him . He was , she decided , like the model for a great Renaissance painter 's masterpiece , a vision of a proud Saint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body at those interestingly vulnerable places . Rocco Cipriani explained as much about the high period of Italian art as a trip to the Met . Yet , at barely twenty-three , he was doing so well at Conde Nast that it was only a question of having a little more seniority , a little more seasoningbefore he would be the art director of his own magazine . She knew full well that he would never stay at Amberville . This was simply one of those sharp , strategic , sideways moves that some of the best and most ambitious art directors made in order to go ahead faster than they would if they stayed at one company during their entire career . . . she 'd done it herself . It made you more appreciated than total loyalty ever did , and it was only risky if you were not very , very , very good . Rocco had nothing to worry about . There are as many kinds of art directors in Manhattan as there are publications and agencies and commercial-makers . Rocco was one of a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything but magazines . He harbored no itch to work in advertising in spite of the desirable big bucks those poor bastards who called themselves " creative directors " made . They were bound by the demands of clients and he was bound by nothing but the limits of his own imagination . For Rocco the ultimate joy in life was pages and pages of an empty magazine , pure glorious white space , space without end , space renewed each month by advertising departmentmagic , waiting for him to fill it with layouts that had never been dreamed of before , combinations of type that had never been put together since typography was invented , graphics that would make history , photographshitherto unimagined , cropped in ways no one had ever cropped before , drawings commissioned from artists who had never been thought142 143of except in terms of gallery and museum walls . Each page of editorial space was to him like a blank canvas to a painter : a new chance to impose his vision of what could be , and like a painter , he was never totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magazine world , still on the rampage , not with armies but with torrents of talent . He worked at least ten hours a day at his desk and then went home to empty his mailbox into which were stuffed magazines from all over the world , each one of which he devoured page by page , cursing horribly when he saw a new idea he had n't thought of himself , raping the magazines of the pages he wanted to study , which he taped to the walls of his big Soho loft until they went from floor to eye level , and were gradually covered over by other pages so that being in the room was like living inside a collage of the best international graphic design . There were only two men in the world whom Rocco Cipriani envied : Alexander Liberman , the genius who was Artistic Director of Conde Nast , and Pavka Mayer . One day he felt sure he was destined to replace one or the other of them , but he also knew he still had a lot to learn , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd be working for Pavka for the first time , indirectly it was true , but still there was always the potential opportunity of picking the man 's great brain . Rocco started at Savoir Vivre on a Monday in mid-July . By Friday , Linda could n't stand it anymore and let herself give in to the temptation to telephone him and find out how things were going . " We 've cleared up all that major lot of undone work and Monday I 'm attacking the November issue , " he said . " Already ? Are you sure ? " " Well , nobody was thrilled about working till midnight every night all week , but they did it . " " What about the Maxi problem ? " " ' Maxi problem ' ? You mean my trainee ? " " If you want to describe her that way , yes . " " Christ , Linda , she 's no problem at all . I ca n't believe what a help that kid is . Does n't even take her lunch hour , just bolts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right back to sweeping up and getting rid of eraser crumbs and making sure that everyone has fresh supplies when they come back from lunch . She seems very grown-up for only nineteen . In on time every morning , last one out at night , does n't fool around in the bagel breaks , brings coffee just before anyone begins to itch for it , keeps myMagic Markers arranged just right , in fact I 've never had such an organizeddesk anywhere . Does n't smoke , wears those demure little dresses , does n't indulge in idle chat and does n't even seem to take time to pee . Maybe she 's a Mormon ? She 's always there when I want her . . . yet she 's never a nuisance . A good lady , that one . Not bad-looking too , now that I come to think about it . . . in fact . . . not bad at all . . . " " Oh SHIT . " " What 's that about ? " " Forget it . Just forget it . Carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach and walk into the ocean until I drown . " " If you 're planning on working all weekend , Rocco , maybe I can help out ? " Maxi suggested casually , holding her breath . She would die for him , she would not just walk on burning coals for him , she would cover herself with them and lie down quietly until it was all over . There was n't anything in the lexicon of human behavior that she would not do for Rocco Cipriani beginning with leaving home and crossing continents on foot and starving in the wilderness . He had only to ask . " I do n't want to interrupt your weekend plans , " he said . " I do n't have any actually . And I could learn a lot while I kept your stuff straight . You know how your layouts disappear under each other when you 're working hard . And . . . I could go out for pizza , " she added , a suggestion that grew from every bit of wisdom she had absorbed in her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And there 's that pizza place right next door that takes so long to deliver that the cheese is always cold . O.K. , come by on Saturday morning about nine . I 'll give you the address . " She took the paper and put it in her handbag to keep forever . She already knew where he lived , she knew his phone number , she knew all about his big family in Hartford , his scholarship to art school , his prizes , his promotions . The advent of Rocco had started a storm of speculation in the art department of Savoir Vivre and Maxi had listened carefully , saying nothing but registering every morsel , weeding out the bits that overlapped or did n't seem to go together and ending up with a fair idea of the truth . She knew he had had a lot of girls but no long-lasting one , she knew his enemies and his friends , she knew as much about this stranger she had met for the first time five days before as it is possible to learn and intuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the act of mental contemplation or recognition or consideration . It went deeper than that philosophical definitionwhich claims for intuition a spiritual perception and immediate144 knowledge that can be ascribed to angelic or spiritual beings . Hers went further and was a good deal shorter . It was Hawthorne 's definition : " A miraculous intuition of what ought to be done just at the right time for action . " The first Saturday and Sunday Maxi spent in Rocco 's loft were busy ones . Whenever she saw that Rocco was lost in thought before his drawing table she moved about the room , so quietly that he never heard her , finding out where he kept his household supplies . She made his bed with fresh sheets and bundled up all his dirty linen and shirts for a trip to that laundromat which , for the first time in her life , she was sure she would be able to find and figure out . She washed her first sinkful of dirty dishes and put them away ; she went through his pantry and made lists of the basics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tackle his drawers or closets . While she bent to these divine tasks she always had one eye on him , and whenever he looked up , needing something , she had it ready for him , with much of the expertise of an operating-room nurse . He gulped down the pizza and sandwiches she brought back for him , sharing them with her of course , but silently , as he thought about the design problems that con- fronted him . Now that the backlog of old work had been cleared up , Rocco wanted to impose his own style on Savoir Vivre before Linda Laf- ferty came back from her vacation . He was immediately concerned with the problems created by a maga- zine devoted to food and wine . He had worked with models and clothes so long that the presentation of objects , whose main relation to the readers was to cause them to salivate , provided him with a challenge which made him oblivious to all else . " One grain , just one grain , " he muttered as Maxi sliced another pizza on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worried . " One single grain of golden caviar , on a full-bleed double spread . The obvious thing to do would be to have Penn photograph it but Penn means Conde Nast and anyway I do n't do the obvious . Laser photography ? Pho- tomicrography ? You ca n't draw caviar  --  or can you ? Maybe , yeah , maybe .. with gold leaf covering both pages and Andrew Wyeth to draw the caviar . . . maybe . . . is that pepperoni ? " " I asked for everything on it . " " Good . " He lapsed back into silence and soon afterwards , seeing that he was about to stop working , Maxi left , so quietly that he did n't notice she was gone . During the following week anyone coming into the art department of Savoir Vivre might have thought himself in the manuscript room of a medieval monastery as the workers bent over their desks with concentratedindustry , trying out all the ideas that Rocco flung at them in his search for ever newer , ever more exciting pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modest but necessary part in this work and even more delighted when she asked him questions that showed how closely she had been watching the whole process of putting a magazine together . Yet he was slightly concerned by the sheer intensity of her interest . . . if she were so involved , might it not all be over as quickly as it had started ? He did n't trust Maxi 's enthusiasm . He was relieved that at least she had spent the weekend visiting her school friend India West , in Connecticut , and was going back there again this coming Saturday . Sunday night Rocco put down his tools , yawned and stretched . " That 's it ! That ought to be it , " he said victoriously to Maxi who had just finished putting his recently washed and dried and rolled socks in military order in a drawer where he could n't miss them . The loft was as immaculate as she could make it without actually disturbing any of the magazines or books or portfolios . " Pizza time ? " she asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stand it . " He grinned at her . Best assistant he 'd ever had , he thought . And he could swear that she 'd done something , he could n't figure out what , which made it easier to get dressed in the morning . " I could cook a steak , make a salad and put a potato in the oven to bake , " Maxi offered . " Where are you going to find all that stuff on Sunday night ? " " In here , " Maxi said , opening the refrigerator which she had stocked the day before . Wilderness survival camp had included basic cooking lessons . " Great . I 'm beat . I think I 'll grab a nap while the potato bakes . Wake me in time for dinner , O.K. ? " " Sure . " Rocco sank into a deep sleep almost immediately . It was so late in the day that the setting sun just dusted the air of the loft , but midsummer light still filled the room . Maxi crept close to Rocco 's bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to clench her fists to prevent herself from146 reaching out and touching his hair . What if he woke up as suddenly as he had fallen asleep ? She had never before been able to gaze directly at him for more than a few seconds except when he was talking to someone at the office , and even then she had been aware that if he looked up and caught her staring she would blush humiliatingly . During their two Saturdays and Sundays in the loft she had been particularly circumspect , knowing that if she distracted him in any way he 'd throw her out . Maxi was so much in love and so much in awe of Rocco that her normal reaction had been frozen . She realized that she had n't been herself since she first laid eyes on him but she did n't know how to become herself with this man , who certainly had not been affected by her in the same way as any other man or boy she 'd ever met . Love had generated in Maxi a condition in which every ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he scratched his head she was charmed . If he bit on his knuckles in thought she was charmed . When he hummed to himself she caught a glimpse of paradise . Maxi 's eyes traced the perfect lines of his lips with a mixture of reverence and desperate longing . Her heartstrings pulled her toward him but she stayed immobile , wildly yearning , yearning with a violence that she knew she would never feel for any other man as long as she lived . She was filled with all the unutterable confusion and single- minded passion of first love . If she could just lift one of the soft black curls on his forehead and touch , just touch the skin underneath . If she could just rub the back of her hand against his cheek . But she did n't dare . The risk was too great . As she knelt there , paralyzed with longing , Rocco 's words suddenly hit her . " Well , that ought to do it , " he 'd said , and stopped working . She knew him well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue . Of course the December issue would be attacked next week but without the same need to invent a new graphic style that had been pushing him to work seven-day weeks . She had never thought about this moment before . Somehow she had let herself believe that these weekends in the loft would continue on . . . but her summer job would last only another five weeks . Panic struck Maxi . Tomorrow she would go back to work , just another body in the crowded art department , fetching and carrying and bringing coffee , and that right minute she had never been able to clearly imagine would never present itself  --  that absolutely necessary minute when Rocco would finally see her . With panic Maxi became Maxi again . The enchantment that had ren- dered her ineffective , inert , was lifted , a spell broken . Her motto , discov- ered in French class , was the words of Danton : " Boldness , again boldnessand ever boldness . " For a minute she paced silently about the loft , and then , whispering " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her jeans and her underwear in a few silent but resolute motions . She untied her espadrilles and stood naked , as rosy and voluptuous as a Boucher , with her full , well-separated breasts that were so young that in spite of their weight they tilted upward from her narrow rib cage . Below her tiny , firm waist , where her white flesh was marked by the belt she had just dropped on the floor , her hips swelled out deliciously , in an excellent yet immoderatecurve . Nakedness was as natural to Maxi as to Eve . She was so perfectly proportionedthat without clothes she seemed taller than when she was dressed . She ran her fingers through her long hair , shaking her head slightly , unable to move for a second . Boldness , she thought , boldness ! She tiptoed over to the bed and bent over Rocco , reassured to see that he was in the deepest possible sleep . Carefully , as lightly as a flower , she lay down next to him , her delicate yet lavish body finding a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung over his face . Boldness , she prayed as she began to kiss him awake , so softly , so sweetly , so gently that it was many minutes before he began to stir and mutter complainingly . She undid the buttons of his shirt and kissed his chest and his throat until he floated up to consciousness , and when she saw him open his eyes she finally kissed him on his mouth , kissed him once and then kept on kissing his lips , moving higher so that her breasts rested on his bare chest , lightly holding his shoulders down on the bed until he woke up completely and tried to sit up . " Maxi ? Maxi ? " he said in amazement . She rolled over on her back and looked up at him through the tangle of her hair , looked right into his astonished eyes . She laughed her great , deep , free , joyous laugh that he 'd never heard before . " I hope you were n't expecting somebody else , " she answered as he bent toward her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say in the RAF , " India West remarked thoughtfully , " you 've bought the farm , Maxi . " " And just exactly what does that mean ? " Maxi asked anxiously . India West was never , never wrong . She was only fifteen , two years younger than Maxi , but from the moment the two of them had met in school , while trying , as usual , to avoid gym class , they had been best friends , joined by an instantaneous appreciation of each other which included a decided preference for heightened versions of the truth . People sometimes took them for liars , as Maxi once explained to India , but they were only rearranging life to make it more interesting for everybody , a public service , as it were . " Crashed your plane , " India said absently , looking at herself in the mirror . " I think I 'm getting rather . . . well , beautiful . What do you think ? " " You know you 're beautiful . When have n't you been divinely beautiful ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about me . " India had just come back from Saratoga where she had spent the summerwith her family . Lily Amberville , the boys and the servants were expected back from Southampton at the end of August . Finally Maxi had somebody she could talk to about Rocco . Rocco was besotted , infatuated , fascinated , her captive . They had been together every minute of the summer , at work and after work , since the first night in July . He was in love with her , truly in love , seriously in love . He had told her so , and Rocco , unlike Maxi , never told anything but the truth . Maxi , in her rapture , could n't understand why India , usually so insouciant , saw a problem in her flawless love . " Seventeen is not nineteen . An Amberville is not an Adams , " India said . " My birthday 's tomorrow , I 'll be eighteen , and I 'm exactly the same person he 's in love with , " Maxi protested . " Not really . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me when he finds out ? India ! That 's ridiculous . " " No , I mean something else , and you know perfectly well what I mean . Just because we go to a school which is politely called an alternative form of education ' does n't mean that either of us is an idiot , " India said severely . " So , O.K. My father is a rich man .. " Ha ! " " One of the richest men in America , all right ? And I do n't go to Vassar , after all . I 'm still in high school . Do two mere years and a father with tons of money make me a leper ? " " You lied to him . " " I lie to everybody . " " So do I . . . but you said Rocco always tells the truth . That means he wo n't trust you anymore . How can a self-respecting , hardworking young man from a nice conservative Italian family with a strong sense of his own values carry on a flaming affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What does that make him ? You 're supposed to be his trainee . ' What does that do to his career ? Apparently the man cares a lot about his work . How can he ever trust you again ? You 've taken him in completely , poor sucker , and if it had started a year ago you 'd be jailbait . And God knows what the consequences will be when Pa and Ma Amberville find out . " India used her voice as effectively as a master bellringer , ringing changes in tones so that no one of any age could ignore her when she spoke . Even Maxi felt effectively subdued , accustomed as she was to the India phenomenon . " I wish you would n't talk to me like that , " Maxi said , taking her streak of white hair and twisting it between her thumb and forefinger and pulling it until it hurt . She was , in spite of her bravado , aware that she 'd painted herself into corners before , but this corner did n't have any floor left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervously . " I have a terrible practical problem . My family 's due back here in a week and my freedom will be gone . I 've been telling Rocco that they 're still in Europe . If I tell him they 're back he 'll expect to meet them . . . he 's old-fashioned about things like meeting parents . " " Ah , so , " said India impassively . " School does n't start for three more weeks , " Maxi continued . " I can tell him they 're still away until then if you 'll cover for me . I 'll tell them I 'm with you when I 'm with Rocco , and on the nights when I simply have to show my face for dinner at home , I 'll tell Rocco I 'm with you . Does that make sense ? " " If he 's so old-fashioned , would n't he expect you to introduce him to your best friend ? " " I 'll say that . . . that you have a phobia . You 're afraid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Why would n't he come to see me ? You said he 's wonderfully compas- sionate . " " You 're afraid to meet strangers . It 's another one of your phobias . He can talk to you on the phone . Reassuringly . " " That takes care of him . What about Pa and Ma ? How come we 're virtually inseparable ? " " I 'll tell them that I 'm helping you study so you can skip into my class . " " You 're helping me study ? " " Sure . They know I can when I want to . It would be a good deed . And if they call your house to talk to me you answer , and make something up about why I 'm not there . " India was a much more inventive and believable liar than even Maxi could ever hope to be . " Which means I have to spend the next three weeks hanging around my telephone , " India grumbled . " And what happens when school really starts ? And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of the house so easily . " " Just give me these three weeks with him . . . by then I 'll have figured something out . " " There 's always the truth . " " India , please , " Maxi pleaded , horrified . " You do n't seem to under- stand . This is the most important thing that 's ever happened to me . Noth- ing like this will ever happen to me again . . . I have to make it work out . The truth . . . please do n't even think that word . It 's too late for the . . . you know what . " " The highest compact we can make with our fellow man is Let there be truth between us two forevermore , ' " India intoned . " Why are you torturing me ? " " It 's Emerson , Ralph Waldo . I 'm reading him . Can I help it if I have a trick memory ? " " Could you please try to remember things on your own time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be all one a hundred years hence . ' " " You 're a comfort to me , India , you really are . Why did I pick a preco- cious brat for a best friend ? " " In skating over thin ice our safety is our speed . ' " " Emerson again ? " " Is he boring you ? " " No , he 's making me feel nervous . " Maxi 's jade-green eyes , widened by anxiety , seemed to absorb all the light in the room into their tantalizing depths . " Listen , Maxi , is it really all that much fun to fool around ? " India asked , with sudden timidity . " Fooling around , " said Maxi , " is the ultimate fun . " " Damn , I was afraid you 'd say that . " It was n't until early October that the truth caught up with Maxi . She had spent so much of her mental energy on hopping and skipping between the lies she and India were telling an increasingly large number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of most females who are making love as often as is humanly possible . She was at least a month , perhaps two , gone with child , as India delicately put it , when together they counted the weeks since Maxi 's last period . They looked at each other in solemn , awed , horrified silence for some time . For the first time since they 'd met , neither one of them was trying to interrupt the other . Suddenly the suggestion of a smile that always shaped Maxi 's lower lip turned into a huge grin and her delicate , wicked , witty face radiated uncomplicated delight . " Fun , " she breathed , " what heavenly , groovy , fabulous fun . Incredible fun . Oh , WHAT FUN ! " She jumped up , lifted India , who was already an inch taller than she , and whirled her around the room in glee . " Fun ? " India squeaked indignantly . " Put me down , you damn fool ! Fun ? " " A baby . A darling little baby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bambino all pink and white and chubby with black curls . Oh , I ca n't wait ! I 'll learn to knit , I 'll take lessons in natural childbirth , I wish he could be born tomorrow . . . did n't I tell you something would happen and everythingwould be all right ? And to have all this fun too , on top of it . . . I ca n't believe how lucky I am ! " " Lord have mercy . " India collapsed in a chair , disbelief in every bone . " Is that your only reaction ? What 's wrong with you ? " Maxi demanded . " I thought you knew how to have fun . " " Maybe my idea of fun is n't the same as yours , " India said faintly . " And , Miz Scarlett , I do n't know nothin ' ' bout birthin ' babies . " " It 's my fault , " said Nina . " I was the one who thought she should have a job . " " It 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who agreed . " " It 's my fault , " Pavka insisted . " I was the one who put her in that art department . And Linda Lafferty says it 's entirely her fault . " 152 " Actually , Pavka , " said Nina , " it 's your secretary 's fault , the one who worships you . She picked Savoir Vivre . " " Listen , you two , it is n't anybody 's fault except Maxi 's . God knows Rocco ca n't be blamed . . . the poor bastard never had a chance once Maxi made up her mind , " Zachary said . " What does Lily think ? " Pavka asked Zachary . " She 's too busy with the wedding arrangements to have time to think . As far as she 's concerned , barely eighteen is a good age to get married if you 're not doing anything else with your life . She was n't much older when we got married . But she insists on a big English wedding with all the nonessentials : bridesmaids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the house turned upside down for the reception . The only problem is one of time . . . they should be married as soon as possible . They 'd be married by now if it were n't for Lily 's plans . But Maxi does n't care one way or the other . . . she 's having too much fun ' to worry about how premature the baby will be . . . I 'm beginning to have visions of her doing a two-step down the aisle carrying the baby instead of a bouquet . " " And Rocco ? " Pavka said curiously . " What about him ? Linda Lafferty says that the two of you agree that he 's doing a fine job , " Zachary said , slightly on the defensive . " I do n't mean his work . . . what about his family ? " " They think anything he does is perfect , " Zachary replied . " We finally got everybody together for dinner and it went as well as any first-time meeting of future in-laws , better maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so we told war stories and Anna , Rocco 's mother , and Lily talked silver patterns and china patterns and wedding dresses , and Maxi just sat there looking as if she 'd accomplished a miracle and won the Nobel Prize for reproduction , and Rocco did n't have anything to say . He looked as if he 'd been hit over the head with a club , or run over by a train , or both . " " Then why on earth , " Nina wondered , " are the three of us sitting around here and worrying about something that everyone else thinks is perfectly fine ? " " Because we all know Maxi , " Zachary answered grimly . Angelica Amberville Cipriani entered the great world in April of 1973 , just a little more than six months after Maxi and Rocco were married , a perfectly respectable degree of prematurity in any society high or low , since the world began counting on its fingers . Rocco had snapped out of his catatonic state once the wedding actually took place and Maxi had153delightedly given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's loft for the arrival of the baby . Lily and Zachary had both tried to insist that the baby should come home from the hospital to a comfortable apartment where Maxi could have a nanny to help her and someone in the kitchen to cook and someone else to clean . They took it for granted that they would buy and furnish the apartment and subsidize the salaries of the staff , but Rocco had firmly refused to take anything from them other than a traditional wedding presentof a silver service . He was making thirty-five thousand dollars a year , and the habit of total financial independence was deeply rooted in him . His own parents had contributed nothing to his upkeep from the day he won his first scholarship to art school , and he had no worries about earning enough to support a wife and child . Maxi was now eighteen , and many other girls in the world in which he had grown up were capable mothers by that age , in competent charge of their modest households . Maxi approached the future with blissful energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could offer Rocco a choice of French , Italian and Chinese food ; she took classes in two separate methods of giving birth , just in case she changed her mind in mid-process ; she shopped at Saks and Bloomingdale 's and even ventured all the way to Macy 's , in order to buy a layette complete in every detail . Sensibly , she stored the dozens of barrels of wedding gifts in a warehouse , except for pots and pans , a set of pottery , stainless-steel tableware and inexpensive glass goblets . Fortunately , Rocco 's loft was spacious enough so that with the help of two neighborhood carpenters they were able to divide it into three separate areas : the baby 's corner , a kitchen and storage section , and a third space in which they would live , eat , sleep , and in which Rocco would have his work table . Rocco had suggested that the third room be further divided to give him a separate workroom , but , as Maxi pointed out , she intended to continuebeing helpful to him when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would be the perfect harmony of last summer , she thought , with the additional joy of the bambino sleeping snugly away in its own little domain . Maxi sat on a hard bench in a small neighborhood park with two scrawny trees , rocking the English pram , conspicuous by its size , its brilliantblue finish , its high , elegant wheels and the fringe on the canvas cover that kept the sun out of Angelica 's eyes . It was August , and hot and humid as only August in Manhattan can be ; the city lay enclosed in a monstrous154 155bowl of airless , evil-smelling gray-yellow stuff that might be air but would kill most Amazonian Indians . Maxi wore shorts and a halter top and flat sandals . Although she 'd pinned up her hair on top of her head to keep it off her neck , sweat-wet strands kept escaping . She fanned herself to no avail with a copy of Rolling Stone , fighting the urge to foam at the mouth , howl like a dog and demand a recount . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigidly . Rocco is fun when he is n't working on that double-sized Christmas issue . Angelica is fun when she is n't screaming , and keeping us awake . Being married is fun when Angelica is sleeping and Rocco is n't working . Cooking is fun when .. . no , cooking was n't really what you could call fun . Not when you had to clean up afterwards . That makes about one fun hour in every forty-eight hours . At least one hour that might have been fun if it were n't so hot and humid . NOTHING is fun in New York in August , she thought savagely , unless the fucking air conditioning works . Their two inadequate window units had both blown from old age when the heat wave started three weeks earlier , and getting new ones in the middle of the hottest summer in years was proving impossible . Day after day Maxi waited for their promised arrival and day after day she was forced to realize that once again they were n't going to be delivered . Each morning Zachary phoned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every night Rocco assured her that she was crazy to stay in town , that he 'd be perfectly all right on his own during the week , and promised to come out every weekend , but Maxi , stubborn as she had never been before in a lifetime dedicated to having things her own way , refused to budge . The first summer , she told herself , was the time of testing , the exam that she knew everybody expected her to flunk . But she was going to stick it out in the city ; she was n't going to run off to her parents ' like a child and abandon her husband when he was working so hard , leaving him bereft of wife and child and tender care . She did n't intend him to be a weekend husband who missed seeing his baby grow up during these few precious months . To turn tail and run off to the cool breezes and the ocean and servants bringing cold glasses of freshly squeezed fruit juice . . . No ! She took out a damp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that crept down her neck . Why could n't she stop thinking about white ? White linen , white sand , little dabs of white clouds in a blue sky over a blue sea , virgin white Pampers , white tennis shoes , maids in white aprons , big , white wooden houses , white wicker tables set with crisp white lace cloths and white Limoges china . White seemed the last thing Manhattan had to offer thisparticular August , except for the filthy litter of once-white paper that blew about her feet . Angelica woke up howling . Maxi picked her up and fanned her frantically . In spite of constant sponging and cool baths the baby had heat rash or prickly heat or some sort of other irritation in half the folds of her plump , four-month-old body . She was a pretty baby , except when her face was screwed up in misery , as it had been for most of the summer . " Poor baby , " Maxi crooned , and felt tears come into her own eyes . " Poor , poor little baby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she sobbed into Angelica 's neck , " oh , poor , unfortunate , brave little baby , what a good little girl you are , and nobody gives you any credit for it , no they do n't , they do n't , they do n't ! " Angelica stopped crying and opened her eyes and pulled on a stray piece of Maxi 's hair and smiled at her . " Oh , " wept Maxi harder than ever , seeing the smile , " you poor little thing ! " She leapt up from the bench and , running , wheeled the pram out of the park . A small cab stopped , seeing her frenzied wave , and Maxi simply abandoned the imported , five-hundred-dollar object on the corner without a second thought , scooped up Angelica and slid into the taxi . " The Saint Regis Hotel , " she told the driver . " Hurry , it 's an emer-gency . " Amberville Publications kept a permanent suite at the St. Regis for visiting customers and everyone at the reception desk knew Maxi on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much chucking and concernas if she had just been pulled into a lifeboat from engulfing waves . Maxi flopped down on one of the beds , clutching her baby , and for a while nothing mattered except the cool air . As soon as she felt enough energy returning , she filled a tub full of tepid water , took off everything she and Angelica were wearing , unpinned her hair and stepped cautiously into the water with the baby in her arms . She lay back in the big tub and floated Angelica above her breasts , supporting her under her armpits and nuzzling her tiny nose . She made little crooning noises and swished Angelica back and forth ; a mermaid and her young . Soon , restored to full efficiency , Maxi bundled herself and the baby into huge towels and attacked the telephone . First she called Saks for baby shirts and nighties , a crib , another pram , baby bed linen and a rocking chair . Then she called Bonwit 's for an assortment of negligees , short silk pajamas and cotton shirts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told him to send up a dozen white vases filled with white flowers . The druggist was instructed to bring up baby oil , baby powder , Pampers and shampoo . Then she phoned F.A.O . Schwarz and ordered a mobile to hang over the crib and duplicates of all her own favorites among156Angelica 's stuffed animals . She called the hotel desk and dispatched bellboysin every direction to pick up her purchases immediately , and then she called room service and ordered lunch . Yes , they could puree carrots and white meat of chicken , they assured her . Finally , Maxi called Rocco at the office . " Darling , " she said excitedly , " I 've just discovered the most marvelous place for us to spend the summer , and it 's only a few blocks from your office . " August heat waves are normal in New York but , as any native knows , they can be almost as bad in September . " Autumn in New York " is a song that should clearly specify October , just as " April in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring umbrellas , warmly lined raincoats and waterproof boots . Maxi , Rocco and Angelica were sheltered by the friendly walls of the St. Regis for another five weeks . Although Rocco could n't help realizing that the room-service bills alone were more than his weekly salary , he forced himself not to protest . No matter how he felt , he reasoned , he could n't insist that the baby be subjected to the heat of the loft . Time enough for them to go home when it was cool again . " I think we should move back tonight , " Maxi said to him one morning in late September , as he left for work . " I thought you were trying to hold out till the first snow , " Rocco said , smiling at her flushed , happy face , and nibbling the tip of her impudently pointed nose . " I 'm tired of room service , " she murmured , licking his chest as high up as she could reach between two of his shirt buttons , underneath his necktie , a maneuver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll try to come home as early as I can and help you pack . " " Do n't bother , sweetheart , I have all day and the hotel staff promised to do most of it for me . . . just come back and pick the two of us up . " That evening , when he reached the hotel , he found Maxi and Angelica waiting in the lobby to meet him . " Everything 's done , " she said triumphantly . They got into a cab and the doorman gave the driver an address and waved them farewell . " Why is he going uptown ? " Rocco asked . " I wanted to stop by and see my family first , " Maxi said gaily . " Then why has he passed your parents ' house ? " Rocco said patiently , realizing that Maxi had planned one of the surprises she loved so much : learning to make tortellini for instance , or framing a group of his sketches157with her own inexpert hands , or finding an old dress for Angelica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cascade of Victorian lace . " Because they 're visiting Toby , " she said vaguely . " And Toby 's visiting a friend ? " " Right . You 're so smart . Did you know I married you for your acute intelligence and not merely for your impossible brooding beauty ? " " I thought I married you because I knocked you up . That 's more or less the general opinion , " Rocco said , delighted with the mischief in her eyes . He had surrendered to her as he would to a girl in a most improbable , happy dream . Sometimes his young wife was , as tonight , the embodiment of a delightful practical joke . " Not in front of the baby ! " Maxi whispered . The cab finally came to a stop before a handsome apartment building on Seventy-sixth Street , between Fifth and Madison . They took the elevator up to the fifth floor and walked along a wide corridor until Maxi rang a doorbell . A uniformed maid opened the door with a smile of greeting . " Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , white-walled , well-shaped room , all brown and terra-cotta and burnt umber , furnished in a way he immediately liked although he did n't know exactly why . " They must be somewhere , " Maxi said , wandering away from him toward a hallway . " Anybody home ? " she called . " Do n't you think we should wait in the living room ? " " Come on , sweetheart , they must be here somewhere , " Maxi answered from the hall , and Rocco followed her as she flitted through charmingly furnished but unpeopled rooms : a baby 's room , a huge bedroom with a four-poster bed covered with an antique quilt , and a shining kitchen , where the maid was cooking busily . In the red-walled little dining room , where the round French provincial table was laid for two , he finally grabbed her and tried to make her stop . " Sit down and wait . You ca n't just go through someone 's house like this , not even you . Or is this some kind of a surprise party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wait , there 's one more room . Maybe they 're in there , hiding . " She opened another door and Rocco found himself standing in a well-lit room bare of all but his work table , his chair and all his working equipment , everything arranged perfectly , not one familiar item missing . Maxi faced him , absolutely delighted with herself . " Do n't think this happened overnight , " she said proudly . " This . . . ? " " Is our house . Surprise party ! ' You are n't as smart as I thought , " she teased . " You know what I said about not taking anything from your parents .. how could you do this , Maxi ? " Rocco asked quietly . " I fully respect what you said . This has nothing to do with it , " she answered , beaming with satisfaction . " Then where does it come from ? " " Me . From me to you , from me to me , from me to Angelica . " " What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust fund . The one Daddy set up when I was born . I came into it on my last birthday . There 's another one I 'll get when I 'm twenty-one and another when I 'm twenty-five . . . Justin and Toby have them too , of course . It 's a way to give your kids something while you 're + still alive so that the government does n't get it all when you die , " Maxi explained , not too sure of the precise details . " Your father , knowing you , gave you a large sum of money ? " Rocco said , disbelief clear in his voice . " Oh , once it was set up there was n't anything he could do to change it . Otherwise I guess he might not have trusted me with so much . But , you see , he would have been wrong , would n't he ? I have n't done anything wildly extravagant , considering . " " Considering what ? " " That I got five million dollars . " " Five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price of buying the apartment , all I 've spent is n't even three-quarters of a million . " " Three-quarters of a million . " " Well , it 's not a big apartment . . . just enough for the three of us , " Maxi explained patiently . Rocco did n't seem to be too bright tonight . " We 'll move when we have another baby . " " Are you expecting another baby ? " Rocco asked in a tightly neutral tone of voice . " Is that another surprise for tonight ? " " Not yet , for heaven 's sake ! " " Let 's go . " " Go where ? " " Back to Soho . If I wo n't take anything from your parents , how could you possibly imagine I 'd take this . . . this place . . . from you ? " he asked , pale with outraged fury , insulted to the marrow of his bones . " But it has nothing to do with my parents . It 's totally different  --  I bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a right to spend my own money , Rocco ? After all , it 's for us , for us to share . " " I ca n't do it . I 'm sorry , Maxi , but there is no way I can do it . It goes against everything I believe in . " " You 're just being stubborn and old-fashioned Italian , and typically male , " she said , her patient tone wearing thin . " I 'm being me . You should have known me better when we got married . I have n't changed . " " Neither have I , " Maxi flashed at him , outraged . " And that , " said Rocco , " is the whole problem . One of us is going to have to change . " His hands were balled into fists . He should have known . He 'd had warning after warning but ignored them , soft fool that he was , not wanting to believe that she was so deeply spoiled , so thoughtlessly capricious . " Do n't look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodbye , Maxi , " he said briefly , afraid that any other words would be irremediably cruel , even more cruel than the end of their marriage . He 'd feared this minute from the beginning , but he had tried to overlook his uneasy intuition of Maxi 's true character . " I 'll send for my stuff . " Openmouthed , Maxi looked at the empty room . She heard the front door close quietly , she waited a few minutes for the doorbell to ring and then she carried Angelica into the lovingly furnished living room and sat down on one of the big , russet velvet sofas . " He 'll be back , Angelica , " she said to the baby . " He just needs to understand that he ca n't boss me around like that . Who does he think he is , anyway ? Nobody talks to me like that , do you hear , nobody ! " and she burst into tears of a fearful grief , for she knew already that neither one of them was going to change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try , because of his absurd , unnecessarypride , that stubborn bastard , and she would not , would , absolutely , not ! She was Maxi Amberville , after all . So why the hell should she ? 13axi never spent so much asone single night in the apartment she had decorated with such disastrous joy . She arranged for Rocco 's work table and supplies to be sent back to him the next day and instructed her real estate agent to sell everything , including the last copper-bottomed saucepan , as quickly as possible , at whatever price was first offered . The divorce was handled with tactful dispatch and without publicity by the Amberville corps of legal experts . Once Rocco had achieved joint custodyof Angelica he agreed that the baby should live with Maxi on a fulltimebasis . He had returned to work at Conde Nast , and the only alternativearrangement possible for him was to hire a nurse to care for Angelica while he was away at the office , which made no sense since the baby had a perfectly good mother . However , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angelica for the weekend , joining the legion of divorced fathers in the park nearby with the doubtful distinction of having the youngest child in his group . Maxi tried to get through the period of her divorce by concentrating ferociously on each detail of raising her daughter . She became an expert on denial ; not thinking , not remembering , not asking herself questions , not wondering " what if " while she conferred with six different but patient Madison Avenue grocers on the quality of their juice oranges and the provenance of their chicken breasts . Nevertheless an appalling , punishing pain located in the very middle of her being vibrated like a tuning fork except when she was actually communing with Angelica , but that healthy baby spent far too much of her first year asleep . Maxi endured the raw torment with silence , for she understood that she had no alternative . Meanwhile she would bathe and feed Angelica and take her downstairs to visit with Lily and Zachary . She had returned home the night Rocco had walked out of the new apartment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mourning lasted throughout the fall of 1973 and the winter of 1974 . It was n't until late in the spring of her nineteenth year that finally there came a day on which Maxi realized that she could now dare161to take stock . She prepared herself for this process by piling her bed high with pillows and lying back on them after she 'd applied the warm , sweetsmellingsleeping body of Angelica on her chest like a mustard plaster . The little girl was over a year old and satisfactorily big enough to provide considerable protection for an adult unfortunate enough to have to examineher own mental condition . What was her exact position in life ? Maxi wondered . How should she define herself ? She had a daughter , she was divorced and in a few months she 'd be twenty . She was no longer an adolescent , she would never be a debutante , she was not a college girl , nor was she an unwed mother . On the other hand she was n't a working woman with a career . It seemed that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interesting , no , make that the fascinating , young divorcee . If people still used that word . What then were the options of this young divorcee who possessed mil- , lions from her first installment of her trust fund ? In principle the world must be full of endless options for someone with so much money and so much time . Obviously she could stay on living in this great gray house , safe , secure and cared for , yet able to come and go as she chose , since she now had the status of adult rather than that of schoolgirl . Using her parents ' home as a base she could venture forth at will to . . . to . . . do what ? In the first place she could  --  and probably should  --  go to college in Manhattan , Maxi ruminated , but damn it , first she 'd have to finish high school . Years of bouncing around the backwaters and byways of the educationalsystem had taught her that there would always be a high school that could be persuaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thereforecollege was a distinct possibility . But did she really feel like taking on the burden of any additional education ? Was n't it now somehow too late and yet too early to return to academia ? Scratch college . Of course there was travel . She could take Angelica and hire a nanny and spend six months or a year in England where her grandparents would introduce her to the world . Maxi 's eyes almost closed as she imagined herself conquering London . She 'd buy the wildest dresses Zandra Rhodes had ever designed , she 'd rent a big flat on Eaton Square , she 'd keep a Rolls  --  no , a Bentley  --  no , a Daimler , the kind of car the Queen always used that was too wide for American roads , and she 'd plunge into all the delightsof London society that her mother had n't bothered about , with the help of the good offices of the nineteenth Baronet and second Viscount Adamsfield . Ah , if only the sixties were n't over . Yet somewhere they must still be lurking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . London . . . Maxi smiled into the dimness of canopied chintz above her bed until sud-163162denly her eyes popped wide open in surprised pique as reality returned Rocco , that impossible , doting Italian papa , would never allow her to tak Angelica away from him for six months at one time . Never . So travel was not an option except for a week or two at the longest . Scratch travel . A job ? A willingness to do the lowliest task in the art department had landed her where she was now , Perhaps the working world was not for her ? Anyway she had a child to take care of . Scratch work . She seemed to be stuck right here , lying on her bed back at home . And that was out . Out ! It felt wrong , no matter how much her parents obvi- ously wanted her to stay . Maxi blew carefully into Angelica 's hair and nibbled on one dark curl . Her parents did n't trust her to exist on her own . She could see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to indicate that the present arrangement was anything but temporary . But she could read their anxious minds . They 'd like her to stay here until another man , a more appropriate one , appeared to lure her back into a domesticity that Maxi had no intention of attempting again . The process of elimination had left her with only one option . She must have her own place in Manhattan . Out ! If she did n't move she 'd fall back into the comfortable , familiar , but decidedly outgrown role of the daughter of the house . Maxi felt a licking , brief bite of apprehension . She 'd never lived alone . She had gone right from her father 's house to her husband 's house and then straight back to her father 's house . All the more reason , Maxi thought , her lips tightened defiantly , to get on with it . She 'd start house hunting tomorrow . She wanted a town house since she could n't have London , a dear little brownstone in which she could entertain her friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day - that she 'd walked into the art department of Savoir Vivre , two years ago , she 'd been so involved in the unfolding drama of her own life that she 'd lost touch with everybody she knew of her own age except India who had so selfishly gone to college . Still , she must know someone . Had n't a famous hostess once said that all you had to do to attract guests was to open a can of sardines and spread the word ? She would buy a can opener , Maxi resolved , and a case of sardines . If life had taught her anything it was that one thing led to another . If there had been any other lessons along the way , she 'd missed them . Once Maxi had resolved to leave her parents ' protection she 'd quickly found the perfect small town house and discovered a team of decorators , Ludwig and Bizet , to help her turn it into a setting that had nothing to do with chronology . It was not the home of an impulsive girl but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cunningly defrosted Louis XV with Venetian touches of high fantasy , the combination mellowedwith English chintz . After Maxi 's first timid venture into introspection she brooded long and often about her future . She had discarded the category of young divorcee almost as quickly as she had thought of it . There were so many other divorced women in Manhattan , forming a vast , unchartered club she 'd rather not join . With far more art and discipline than she had employed in preparing herself for her first day at work , she carefully went about creatinga new Maxime Emma Amberville Cipriani , one who would be immediatelyrecognizable as a widow . Widowhood  --  early , cruel , accidental and mysterious widowhood  --  was a condition so much more desirable than any other open to her . It was a state that combined a certain mournfully elegant status with a distinction and an aura of  --  poetry ?  --  yes , poetry , if you did it right , she thought , her lips quivering with a suppressed grin . Maxi worked her way toward widowhood by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silences into which she fell unexpectedly ; by a finely tuned , brave dignity in which she wrapped herself . She dimmed the field of energy in which she usually moved and turned it inward , so that it was obvious  --  but never immediately or painfully obvious  --  thatshe was suffering from an unspoken sorrow with which she would trouble no one . Now she dressed in black at all times : quiet , serious , expensive , indecently becoming black . The only jewelry she wore had been her parents ' wedding present , a glorious double strand of Burmese pearls , graduated from twelve to nineteen millimeters , each perfectly round globe radiating a matchless luster , and of course , the widow 's necessary ornament , a modest , plain wedding band she longed to throw in the garbage . As soon as Maxi found herself alone at home she changed immediately into old jeans and worn T-shirts but she never left the house unless she was raven-clad from head to toe , even if she were going to the country in black pants and a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a delicious pallor , she threw away her collection of blushers and lipsticks and concentrated on demurely darkening the area around her eyes with smoky grays and taupes . If only India were around to appreciate her efforts , she thought longingly , as she staged her effects . Just as Maxi forbade herself her belly laugh she made a rule never to talk about herself . Instead she grew adept at drawing people out on their all-time favorite subject : themselves . She learned to subtly sidestep all questions about her private life and automatically refused two out of every three of her many invitations  --  for the sardines had worked marvelously164 165well  --  in order to stay home with Angelica . Although she was deeply , constantly tempted , she never went so far as to tell anyone that Rocco Cipriani was dead  --  stone-cold dead  --  but she never referred to a former husband , or a previous marriage . Since the length of time people bother to remember details of each other 's private lives in Manhattan is determined by how much fuel is flung on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her twenty-first birthday . It was not a widowhood without distractions . She took with utmost discretion , a baker 's dozen of lovers , in not too rapid succession ; each one impeccable , eligible , eager to marry her and free of any problems presented by an alliance with a man who might not understand that her money was her own to spend as she liked . Yet not one of them had seemed somehow necessary enough to keep longer than a few months . Maxi became convincedthat she 'd never fall in love again and the thought , although melancholy , was balanced by the freedom it gave her . She had become , she flattered herself , an updated Henry James heroine , a woman with a past that was only dimly known ; whose present was tantalizingly private yet illuminated by the blaze of her independence , her family , her fortune , and  --  why not be blunt  --  her face ; a woman whose future held infinite promise . One fragrant August in 1978 , Maxi drifted toward the entrance to the Casino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness , relaxed in the knowledge that the principality had one policeman for every five visitorsand every woman could safely wear all her jewelry in public on the darkest street of the little city . In her bones she felt there was a lucky seat at the chemin de fer table just waiting for her but she was n't in a hurry to get into the action . This was Maxi 's first evening in Monte Carlo and literally the first time in her life that she was utterly free to come and go as she pleased , alone and on her own , unquestioned , unaccounted for and accountable to no one . Her parents were in Southampton . Rocco had finally been able to arrange matters at the magazine so that he had August off and he had taken Angelica to visit his parents in the country outside of Hartford . Maxi had refused a number of proposals to be a houseguest or to join traveling friends , and quietly reserved a suite for herself at the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo , a corner suite , majestically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room from which she had watched the sunset . Far below her she could see the crowded port ofMonte Carlo ; beyond it on a jutting , rocky promontory , rose the palace and beyond the palace was the remarkable sky , meeting the remarkable sea on which dozens of pleasure craft were coming into the harbor . There was no hint from the view from Maxi 's suite that every week one more of the charming Edwardian villas that , for so long , were the enchantment of the city , was demolished , each to be replaced by yet another , Miami-modern high-rise apartment building ; no hint that every last square inch of Grimalditerritory was being exploited with an unsentimental thoroughness that was far more Swiss than Mediterranean . August , no matter how hot , is the season for Monte Carlo , the month of balls and fireworks , of ballet and of a gathering together of a particular  --  and often peculiar  --  assortment of royalty-groupie rich from all over who never miss that once-a-year visit to Monaco . August is the one thirty-onedaybonus period during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accountants command them to become residents of Monaco , can rent their expensive dwellings and make enough to pay for their upkeep during the other eleven months ; the one month during which the harbor yacht moorings are at a premium , the one month in which the myth of Monte Carlo is annually reborn . Maxi felt intoxicatingly reborn herself . In anticipation of her trip she had assembled a new wardrobe that filled seven suitcases , a wardrobe from which all black was banished ; she had armed herself with an enormous letter of credit to a local bank and just that afternoon she had changed so many dollars into francs that her evening bag bulged . A certain Beekman Place high-stakes poker game , which took place nightly in New York , had occasionally enlivened her sumptuous early widowhood , but Maxi had always had a yen to visit a real casino that would in no way resemble Las Vegas . Gambling , she thought , was a little like shopping . . . you could n't really do it right as part of a couple . Call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of luck , or even just picking numbers  --  allgambling boiled down to choice , and choice was not a collaborativeor a cooperative pursuit , arrived at with someone looking over your shoulder and making suggestions . It would be good for her , Maxi thought virtuously , to have a fling . Widowhood was so constricting . She deserved a fling , and obviously everyone in the crowd that pressed toward the entrance to the Casino felt equally festive . The first large rooms of the ornate building were disappointing ; filled with casually clad tourists playing slot machines , the high , painted ceilings seeming to look down in grief on such ignoble goings-on . But once past the stern men who guarded the entrance to the private rooms , Maxi discovered that the legend of the Casino of Monte Carlo still existed , as **25;14769;TOOLONG , as firmly locked into history as if it were a fourmastedsailing ship that had somehow sailed out of the past . An Edwardianglamour , voluptuous and unashamed , showered down in gilded splendor ; a sweeping waltztime drowned out the mad jazz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popping lights of the slot machines . Lowvoiced , purposeful , well-dressed people moved here and there in the air that was charged with an almost unbearable excitement , the thrill that can only be imprinted on a space devoted to gaming , wagering , playing , betting , in short , gambling . No one was immune to its spell , least of all Maxi Amberville . Curbing her quick New Yorker 's pace , Maxi moved into the Casino with felicitous poise , with the self-assurance that can never be feigned , of a beautiful woman who is perfectly at ease without an escort . She wore a long , strapless , chiffon dress that was one shade lighter than the green of her eyes and diaphanous to the point of cruelty . Her black hair , which she wore pulled back severely from her face in New York , had been allowed to fall freely over her shoulders . She had transformed her double strand of pearls into one long rope that hung down over her bare white back , she 'd thrust a spray of tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widowhood . . . nor maidenhood . She looked as fastidiouslyhaughty as she felt ; a fine feline female out on the town . It was too early in the evening for baccarat or chemin de fer she decided . She 'd try roulette just to warm up and orient herself . She 'd never played it but it looked like a silly , easy kids ' game in which no skill was involved . Maxi went to the cashier and bought chips for ten thousand dollars , receiving a hundred big black chips in exchange , each worth five hundred francs . She could n't do much damage with that little lot , Maxi thought , as she slid into a chair at the nearest roulette table . She decided to play her age and asked the croupier to put ten chips on twenty-three black . The wheel spun , finally stopped and Maxi was a thousand dollars poorer . Perhapsher next birthday ? The twenty-four black yielded nothing . Nevertheless , she thought , if it had come up , she would have made thirty-five thousand dollars since all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the beginner 's luck to which she was entitled ? On the other hand , roulette was not normally considered an investment , she reminded herself as she pondered her next choice . The man next to her spoke to the croupier . " Ten on zero , " he said in an accent that Maxi could n't identify . She glanced at him curiously . He was slumped on one elbow as if only that bone was holding him up and he wore the most miserably threadbare dinner jacket that she had ever seen . His dark hair needed cutting , hishollow cheeks needed shaving , and his eyes needed opening , for his lids were so low and his black lashes so long that it seemed impossible that he could see . He looked like a scarecrow , a bored yet oddly elegant scarecrow who had been left out in the fields until the birds had picked him almost to pieces . She drew slightly away . Obviously this was the sort of riffraff to whom a foolhardy fling at roulette was the final episode in a sordid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his finely cut profile ? Yet he had the most beautiful hands she 'd ever seen , with immaculatenails . A professional cardsharp ? Probably not , for what self-respecting professional could dream of looking so down at the heels , so pathetically scruffy ? Maxi absently lost seventy more chips as she continued to take inventoryof the man who had only given her the briefest of glances . Somewhere in his thirties , she decided , and probably Irish , for who but the Irish combined such white skin and such black hair ? If his eyes were blue that would be final proof , but they were still hooded . He lost his ten fivehundred-francchips and lazily put the equivalent of another thousand dollars on the zero again . His expression did n't change and he seemed to take no interest in the rollicking dance of the ball as the wheel turned , first quickly , then gradually slowing to a stop . Maxi lost again as she noted , fascinated , that the man wore ancient tennis shoes and baggy white socks , and that his dinner jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looped the necessary tie as casually as if it were a piece of string . It probablywas a piece of string , and frayed string at that . Maxi realized that she had only ten chips left . She beckoned to the attendant who hovered by the table and gave him the money to buy anotherfifty chips . Her neighbor looked up at the sound of her voice . " Ten for me , please , " he said casually , without offering money . Obviouslyhe was hoping for credit from the Casino , Maxi realized . " Sorry , sir , " the attendant said , refusing his request . " No more ? " " I 'm afraid not , sir . " " Not my night . " He offered the comment in infinite expressionlessness . " No , sir , " the attendant agreed , going to get Maxi her chips . So he was Irish , she thought . There was no disguising the classic deep blue of his eyes during the brief exchange . An Irish wharf rat , probably off the crew of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Casino in a borrowed dinner jacket and lost his last franc or dime or farthing or whatever he 'd had when he came in . Still there was n't an Irish lilt to his voice but some other accent  --  English but not British , whatever that meant she thought confusedly. 168 He reached into his socks and pulled out five black chips from each one with the kind of supremely indifferent look that Maxi knew must mean that he had been saving this stash for just this moment . She felt sorry for the feckless creature , she realized . There was something gallant and touch- ing in the way he refused to show his absolute desperation . He was obvi- ously at the end of the line . Who knew what fate awaited him after he 'd lost his last chips ? He 'd probably borrowed the money he had been playing with . Or even stolen it . Yet he 'd put all ten big chips on the zero again , not even holding back a single one to give himself a chance to play one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the little ball finally dropped to rest . On the zero . Maxi clapped both hands loudly in delight . Thirty-five thousand dollars  --  that should keep him from shooting himself . She smiled at him in congratulation and saw , to her disbelief , that his eyelids were not even raised . Should she nudge him ? Had n't he seen ? There was a rustle of interest as the croupier took the next bets but the man next to Maxi never moved . Finally , the croupier said , " Still on zero , sir ? " " Yep . " He was going to let the money ride , Maxi realized in horror . The odds that the zero would come up twice in a row were beyond reckoning . Was he mad , drunk , doped , or did n't he understand the game ? Maxi forgot to bet as she fought not to say something and when the croupier barked " Rien ne va plus " she realized that it was too late to give advice . She sighed and waited for the inevitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skipped , as the wheel slowed and the ball fell . On the zero . A gasp rose from the crowd that stood around the table . The scarecrow had won thirty-five times one hundred and seventy-five thousand francs . Even Maxi 's rusty multiplication table told her that it was over a million American dollars . Considerably over . This should make him open his eyes , this should make him look a little less hopeless , she thought , turning to- ward him and meeting his glance for a second . Was that a smile on his lips ? Was that a raising of his lids ? Was there a flush of color in his cheeks ? No . Absolutely not . He was still slumped on one elbow , he had n't reached for his chips , he did n't look any less removed or detached than when the attendant had refused him credit . Clearly a mental case . " Take those chips off the board , " she commanded him in a low voice . " Why ? " he asked mildly . " Because otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't argue . It 's the chance of a lifetime , " Maxi hissed at him furiously . " And play it safe ? " he asked , almost sounding faintly amused . Action at the table had been stopped as the croupier waited for a casino official to permit him to accept the bet . The official arrived , looked at the scarecrow with an indefinable expression and reluctantly nodded at the croupier to go ahead . As a big , buzzing crowd immediately gathered around the table , Maxi , in her agitation , again forgot to bet . The man was clearly insane . Criminally insane . The law of averages had n't been suss pended for his sake and there was no possibility that the ball would come back to zero a third time . The Casino knew that as well as she did or they would never have allowed the game to continue . How many men had really been given a chance to break the bank at Monte Carlo ? The croupier busied himself with the other players and only when they had all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Will you stay on the zero , sir ? " " Why not ? " he asked with a hint of a yawn . Maxi watched in outrage as the croupier began to set the wheel in motion . There was n't a sound from the crowd . The croupier 's lips opened to say the words " Rien ne va plus , " and in that split second Maxi catapultedherself wildly onto the pile of chips on the zero . She scooped them all off the table , scattering them around the man at her side before the bet could be finalized and the chips lost forever . A roar of scandalized disbelief rose from the crowd . Her breach of casino etiquette was so unthinkable that their attention was switched from the wheel to Maxi . Indignantly she glared at the watchers . Barbarians , she fumed to herself , just waiting to see someone thrown to the lions . Well this is n't going to be your day , you bastards , even if I do look silly . She stared down the jabbering mob in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching the wheel , not touching a single one of the chips that she had saved for him . Cold sweat covered her in a flash . She had just remembered something else about the law of averages . Each spin of the wheel was a fresh start , as if it had never spun before . Oh no , she prayed , no , please . In the sudden utter silence of the Casino only the wheel could be heard . Maxi closed her eyes . A wild incredulous sound came from the bystanders . Zero . Again . Maxi sat frozen , waiting to die . She deserved it . Murder was too good for her . A hand reached out and closed on her upper arm . He was going to break it . Yes , bone by bone , every bone in her body . He had every right . She would n't defend herself . " Nobody will ever call you a cheap date , " the scarecrow commented mildly as he rose from his seat , lifting her with him , leaving the chips Maxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attendant . Maxi opened her eyes and burst into tears . She was going to live . He was even more insane than she had realized but not criminally insane . " I do n't like to see a woman cry , " he remarked kindly . Maxi stopped immediately . She did n't dare not to . He gave her a surprisinglyclean handkerchief and helped her blow her nose and dry her eyes . " It 's only money , " he said , smiling for the first time . " Only money ! Over forty million dollars ? " He shrugged . " I 'd inevitably have lost it back to the house another day . You do n't imagine that they 'd have let me bet if they did n't know that for sure , did you ? You 're not working for the house by any chance ? No , I did n't think so . But they do owe you a free drink . Come on , sit down here and I 'll order . Champagne ? " " Something much stronger , " Maxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grass tequila . " He motioned to awaiter . " My usual , Jean-Jacques , and one for the lady . A double . " " Bad luck , Monsieur Brady , " the waiter said sympathetically . The scarecrow looked closely at Maxi . " Not necessarily , Jean-Jacques , not necessarily . " He turned to Maxi . " Drink up and I 'll take you home . " " Oh , no , you do n't have to do that , " she protested . " Might as well . After all , I own you now . Forty million dollars worth anyway . " " Oh . " " You do agree ? " he asked politely . " Yes . Of course . It 's only . . . fair . " And Maxi thought , there could be worse fates . Far far worse . But she 'd absolutely have to do something about his clothes . Dennis Brady was the first remittance man that Australia had sent back to the old country . A century earlier his ancestor , Black Dan Brady , emigratedto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enormous silver deposit at Wasted Valley in the New South Wales Outback . In the decades that followed , the Wasted Valley Proprietary Companyfound vast amounts of iron ore , coal and manganese . By 1972 , in addition to the mine operations , its assets included huge steel mills and oil ventures which accounted for three percent of Australia 's gross domestic product , and a cash flow of close to a billion dollars a year . Its chief liability was its rebellious chief stockholder and orphaned only heir to the Brady fortune , Bad Dennis Brady , who was bored , bored , bored with Melbourne ; bored , bored , bored with being the richest man in Australia ; bored , bored , bored with discussions about drilling for oil off the coast of China , finding copper in Chile , or mining gold in South Africa . Dennis Brady had not the slightest interest in extracting another ounce or gram or droplet ofanything whatsoever out of this planet . On the other hand he dearly loved a wager . But gambling is not permitted in Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to him that they had barred him from play forever . They could n't call him a black sheep , he told the board of directors meeting of Wasted Valley that he had convened , because a black sheep does n't pay his debts , nor could they call him a wastrel because he often ended up winning , and , over the long haul , was almost even , although he knew perfectly well that the odds would always be with the house , but no one could call him an asset to the company either . And there was no need to take a vote on that , gentlemen , thank you very much indeed . He 'd tried , God knows he 'd tried , for twenty-nine miserable years , to be a credit to the Brady dynasty but it just was n't going to work out . Too bloody boring by half . Would n't it be better for everyone if he cleared out , went back to wherever it was that Bradys had come from in the first place and left them to get on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aye  --  no never mind the formalities  --  he 'd just remembered that he owned more than enough stock to cast the deciding vote . Could he buy anyone a farewell drink ? " What happened next ? " Maxi asked , fascinated with his story . " They said it was too early in the day for a drink but they rather thought I had the right idea and they all shook hands . Good chaps . They 're undoubtedly still drilling and smelting and forging away and looking for new companies to buy . They 're as industrious as a bunch of giant Santa 's helpers . .. motivated , businesslike , patriotic , good to their mothers  --  useful but all so terribly tedious . " " Did you go back to Ireland ? " " Good Lord , no . Never cared for racing or breeding the beasts  --  I 'm allergic to horses and I ca n't endure rain . Came straight here and bought this lovely yacht and I 've been here ever since . It 's not quite the biggest one in the port but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the happiest ship in the harbor . " " But what do you do , Dennis ? " " Do ? Well . . . I just . . . live , you know ? A little here , another bit there . Water ski , drink a little , drink a lot , listen to music , sail , fly my helicopter  --  sometimes we even take the ship out for a day or two . It 's a full life . Occasionally I 'm so busy I do n't even get to the Casino before midnight . I 've put myself on a strict credit limit there . . . it might get boring otherwise . " " Are you never bored anymore ? " 172 173 " Would you consider marrying someone like me , Maxi ? " Dennis Brady asked humbly . Startled , Maxi turned toward him as he lay , long , lean and unexpectedly strong , beside her on the bed of the main cabin of the yacht . Without his deplorable garments he was a superlatively well-made man and all the energy he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently been saved just for her , to judge by the last day and a half . " Someone like ' you ? . . . there is n't anyone like you , Dennis , or the world would be a different place  --  no aggression , no ambition , just sex and casinos . . . maybe paradise is like that . " She ached exquisitely in every major and most minor muscles and her mind was so blissfully unhinged that it was almost impossible to speak , much less think . " Well , actually , to come right down to it , I meant me in particular , yes , just me , Maxi . " " Would I ? Marry you ? " " That 's the general idea , yes . " " What time is it , Dennis ? " Maxi mumbled , remembering . " It 's ten in the morning . " " How long have we been on board ? " she asked , yawning hugely . " Exactly thirty-four hours . Oh , Maxi darling , come on and answer me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider . This seemed important . " Let 's see . Thirty-four hours plus the two hours you spent talking makes thirty-six so that leaves you four more hours ... so . . . if you can manage to arrange it before the time 's up , what choice do I have ? " " I did hope you 'd see it that way , " Dennis Brady said joyfully , wrapping a towel around his middle and grabbing the phone at the side of the bed . " Captain , how long will it take you to get out into international waters ? What ? No , I do n't give a damn about the harbor master . How many of the crew went ashore ? Well , make do , man , make do . By the way , you are a real captain are n't you ? I know , I know , of course I 've seen your Master 's Certificate  --  have you ever performed a wedding ? Just a burial at sea ? Well if you can do one you can do the other . Break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under way . " " I do n't have anything to wear , " Maxi said automatically , choking with laughter . Mrs. Bad Dennis Brady . What would people think ? What did it matter ? What a dear he was . What fun they would have ! She simply was n't responsible . Everyone understood that a debt of honor had to be paid or you lost your good reputation . " Let 's say that I 'm not bored now . I 've never owned a forty-milliondollargirl before . I wonder what I should do with you first ? " " Maybe if you thought of me as just a girl . . . " Maxi murmured , trying to make out his face in the darkness of the deck . Most of the other yachts in the port had put out all but their running lights while they talked , and Bad Dennis Brady had almost disappeared in the moonless night . She missed being able to watch his half-tragic , half-fey face , she realized , rather more than she 'd expected . " But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you all this , " he protested . " What do you talk about with girls you do n't own ? " " Not much , " he said wistfully . " You 're shy , " Maxi diagnosed . " No , basically just Australian . Australian men prefer action to talk when it comes to women . At least that 's the general notion . " " But according to you , no one was ever a less typical Australian . " " Well I ca n't be can I ? Poor eye-to-hand coordination , you know . I never was any good at games , particularly soccer . My guardians , when my parents died , sent me to England for quite a while so I do n't even sound right . A half-assed Australian and an all-around total misfit , I 'm afraid . " He sighed pathetically in the darkness and reached out and took Maxi 's hand in both of his . The minute she felt his touch she knew that there was at least one sport in which Dennis Brady had won high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loafing , but not , oh no decidedly not harmless . Every warning bell in her system went off . " Ah , poor Bad Dennis , that 's a sad story and no mistake , " she crooned . " But as much as it pains me to have to remind you  --  the meter 's running . " " The meter ? Oh , of course . . . I 'd almost forgotten . How much ? " " One million dollars . " " Per week ? " he asked hopefully . " No , Dennis , " she said patiently . " Per day ? " He tried to sound incredulous . " Per hour . . . and you 've just spent two of them talking . " " Good Lord ! I think that 's a bit high . On the other hand , it is slowerthan roulette . Or should be , if done properly . Well , if you 're sure ? " " I am , " Maxi answered crisply . " In that case , perhaps you might . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his feet . " I 'm yours to command , " Maxi answered . " I like this game , " Dennis Brady announced happily . " Even if you ca n't bet on it . " 14oor dear sweetie , old Bad Dennis , " Maxi said thoughtfully as she and India sat over a frivolous dinner at Spago , their favorite Hollywood restaurant . " He still sends me the saddest postcards and it 's over a year since I left him . " India paused in the middle of lifting a forkful of goat cheese pizza to her lips . " Why do you sound even faintly regretful ? I clearly remember your telling me that you could n't take life in Monte Carlo another minute . I even remember your quoting Emerson . To live without duties is obscene '  --  was n't that it ? " " It was . It still would be . I deeply regret another divorce but I 'll never forget waking up and realizing that the darling lad had n't had a dull moment during the few months we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , India , it was so boring , boring , boring to live with a man who did n't do anything in particular but hang about being an utterly lackadaisical , perfectly joyous good-for-nothing and did n't even feel the smallest twinge of guilt about it . I suppose I kept comparing him to my father , which was n't fair , of course , because Dennis had warned me what he was like . You know how much my father accomplishes every day and how charged up and enthusiastic he is about his work , and how he communicatesthat energy , and how much I admire him ? I guess he 's ruined me for a man who is n't at least trying to do something , no matter what . What 's more , shuttling poor little Angelica and Nanny Grey back and forth from Monte Carlo to Manhattan every month was just about impossiblebut that bastard , Rocco , simply would n't , under any circumstances , let her spend more than half the time with me . He took a much bigger apartment with plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint custody what could I do ? Still , Angelica might have been on the verge of getting too much attention with a crew of twenty all doting on her . " " Did the lovemaking get boring too ? " " No , " sighed Maxi . " I wish it had . But you ca n't base your entire future on sexual attraction . " " You ca n't ? " India asked suspiciously. 175 " Not beyond a certain limit and I did n't want to reach that day so I left before it happened . " " Are you sure you 're not still a little bit in love with him ? " India said dubiously . " Actually I do n't think I ever was in love ' with him . . . I just plain loved him . . . he was so needy and lost and . . . lusty . I loved the Australianin him . If only he had n't been so totally determined to be shiftless . " Maxi sighed deeply . " I did care for him , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked severely at her mesquite broiled salmon and wished it were pizza too . Maxi had flown to Los Angeles to visit India who had a free weekend between pictures . India had slipped into movie stardom with the irritating ease with which she 'd gone through school with straight A 's and Maxi felt jealous of the demanding film industry that imprisoned her friend so far from New York , or sent her on location to impossible places ; jealous of the fun she was certain that India was having in spite of her complaints that making movies was irksome drudgery , comparable at best to being a privilegedinmate in a minimum-security prison . " Well , forget Dennis Brady , " India advised , tackling a huge plateful of pasta with wild Japanese mushrooms and duck sausage . " I did , a long time ago . You were the one who brought him up . " " I simply asked if there were any new men in your life and you said not even one who was worth comparing with Bad Dennis . " " India , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're still giving me advice ? " Maxi asked sharply . " What does my being neurotic have to do with my ability to help someoneelse ? " India asked , offended . People never understood about psychoanalysis , not even Maxi . " I do n't understand why you 've started to think of yourself as neurotic , " Maxi replied . " You 're no different than you used to be as far as I can tell  --  precocious , flaky , much too beautiful and kind of weird . But now you 're famous . " " I 'm a ten-foot-pole neurotic , the kind who wo n't let a man get emotionallyclose to her until she meets a guy who 's a seven-foot-pole neurotic with a three-foot feather duster attached to his head , " India said broodingly . " And fame only makes it worse . " " What 's this Doctor Florence Florsheim going to do about you ? " " Do ? She 's not supposed to do anything  --  I 'm the one who has to change . The best thing about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's supportive , that she believes in you ? " Maxi asked excitedly. 177176 " No , Maxi , she validates my parking ticket for the lot next to her of- five , " India explained patiently . " You 're supportive , you believe in me , because you 're my friend and you do n't know any better . She 's my shrink , not my buddy . She listens and does n't make judgments and every two weeks or so she might ask a question . Also she does n't give a hoot in hell what I look like , which is the most marvelous relief . There 's no point in not telling her the truth because she ca n't read my mind and if I lie it costs me time and money , since eventually I have to tell the truth or I 'm not playing fair and wo n't get helped . I can tell her anything I want to and know she 'll never be shocked because there 's nothing she has n't heard already . If I should say anything important she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure about that ? " " No . It 's an article of faith . You have to have faith in your shrink , Maxi , and if you start to doubt her you have to tell her all about it which takes another year . The main thing , I guess , is that she 's my ally . I pay her for it admittedly but still I 've got to have a staunch day-to-day ally , especially in this town . " " Did she say she was on your side ? How do you know she 's your ally ? " " I feel it . . . and stop asking for guarantees because she does n't pass them out . Now , could we stop trying to explain the inexplicable and talk about what you plan to do next with the life you 've utterly wasted except for producing Angelica ? " India asked kindly . " I 'm going to London next week . I 've wanted to spend time there for years and Angelica 's going to be with Rocco all of July this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With my grandparents , of course . They 'd be terribly offended if I did n't . They 're in their late sixties now and more alarmingly vigorous than ever . They 've planned all sorts of things for me involving jolly entertain- ment and meeting people including cousins in the second , third and fourth degree , none of whom I know . " " That sounds . . . interesting , " India said . " You mean it sounds perfectly awful . " " That too , that too , " India agreed cheerfully . " There 's no point in trying to do anything about it , " Viscountess Ad- amsfield said to her husband in a gloomy tone that was at odds with her feeble attempt at philosophy . " But of all men to choose , of all possible Scots , and god knows , I like the Scots almost more than any other people on earth , your granddaughter had to pick a Kirkgordon ! Laddie Kirkgordon no less , and after knowing him less than two months  --  his family lost almost everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've been going downhill ever since , " her husband growled . " She 's your granddaughter too and he is , after all , Oswald Charles WalterAngus , Earl of Kirkgordon , ruined or not . " " Oswald ! No wonder he 's called Laddie , " Evelyn Gilbert Basil Adamsfieldfumed . He 'd been lucky to extract a miserable " Bertie " out of his name after two dozen fistfights at school . " Oswald was king of Northumbria from 635 to 642 . Apparently the name is a family tradition , " Lady Adamsfield said sadly . " Oswald was king for only seven years , unfortunately , but he must have been a very holy man , sending out all those missionaries to convert the heathen , you know . " " No I did not . And I do n't care . Why did n't Oswald mind his own business ? I suppose Maxi 's been educating you ? Is that girl bucking for sainthood this time around ? " " She 's in love , Bertie . She told you herself . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not going to pretend that I like it , Maxime , and that 's that . I had a splendid husband picked out for her , as well you know . " " Maxi said he was a twit . " " No marquis is a twit , and most particularly not one who 's practically a duke . His father wo n't last out the year . He 's a bit dim , perhaps , but not a twit . What 's more , his family has always been loyal to the crown and those wild , daft Kirkgordons are still loyal to the House of Stuart . As far as they 're concerned a descendent of Mary Queen of Scots should be on the throne . No wonder they 're down and out ; idealistic , unrealistic , notoriouslyeccentric , the whole crazy , stubborn pack of them . And her Laddie the worst of the lot . " " I rather think that 's what Maxi sees in him . She said he had a strong sense of destiny , something to live and fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passionate striving , a . . . " " Spare me , Maxime , my darling . I was at the wedding too and what Maxi sees in him is obvious . " " You have to admit that he is rather gorgeous , " Lady Adamsfield said dreamily . " In fact , I have n't seen a better-looking creature in a long , long time . . . that noble head , those blue , blue eyes , that wonderfully fresh , ruddy coloring , that sandy hair , almost golden , when you come to think about it , that great height , those shoulders ... " " That crumbling castle , those barren acres . . . " " Those historic , twelve-feet-thick walls , that breathtaking view . .. " 178 179 " He does n't have a shilling and she could have been a duchess . . . " " She 's quite rich enough in her own right , pet , she is a countess and he absolutely adores her ... " " Maxime , " said Viscount Adamsfield , " you 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensible woman . " " Well , I just hope she 's settled down for good this time . " " Maxi ? Settled with a Kirkgordon ? I very much doubt it , my dear . Settled down indeed ! " " What 's that , for heaven 's sake ? " Milton Bizet demanded , recoiling . " What does it look like ? " his partner , Leon Ludwig , said smugly . " A telephone-book-sized telegram . It must be from Maxi . Hand itover . " " If you knew , Milton , why did you ask me what it was ? " " To indicate my alarm , curiosity and feverish delight . I 've actually been wondering why we had n't heard from her except for the announcement of her wedding to that utterly glorious-looking Kirkgordon person . Our Maxi and her indecently macho earl must have bought a marvelous house in London by now , I said to myself , and she certainly is n't going to be unfaithful to us and let some English decorators get their beastly little hands on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but where in Mayfair ? Now give me that telegram . " " It 's a castle , " Ludwig announced , handing over the pages . " Trust Maxi . We taught her to think big . " " In Scotland , " Ludwig said ominously . " Oh , no . " " Oh , yes . Somewhere between Kelso and Ettrick Forest , so she says , as if we 'd know where that was , no heating at all except for a few fireplaces that are big enough to roast a whole sheep in , no minstrel galleries , no follies , no marvelous paneling , no family heirlooms , no tapestries , no pictures , almost no bathrooms , tiny little windows so that it could be defendedfrom the invading Royalist troops , whatever that means , Lord knows how long ago . And the whole damn thing has been falling to pieces for at least a thousand years and even when it was in its glory it was n't vaguely comfortable . . . not a stately home , Milton , oh no , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maxi wants us to get over there as soon as possible , preferably tomorrow , so we can start to make it cozy . Apparently she 's found a horrendous problem with dry rot and you know what that can lead to . She says the decor consists of a hundred stags ' heads and hoards of horrid stuffed fish hanging on the walls and that there isn'teven any decent family silver except for some sort of sacred chalice or other . Poor Maxi . " Ludwig subsided with a tiny sigh . " Why poor Maxi ' when money 's no object ? " Milton Bizet inquired . " I remember when we had to fly to Monaco to redecorate Blissful Dennis 's yacht ... he did n't care what we spent . I did love that job . In fact I rather loved Dennis , did n't you ? He looked just like Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia . " " Only not as well dressed , " Leon Ludwig pointed out , with a small , nostalgic smile . " And will you ever forget the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we talked her into getting rid of that first little brownstone ? " Bizet continued . " She really went the distance on that place . I suppose that she 'll keep the new apartment she 's bought in Trump Tower for a pied d terre when she gets tired of deer stalking or whatever it is she intends to do in Scotland , do n't you ? " " All I 'm sure of is that money is n't the problem . It never is with Maxi . It 's us . . . we 're going to have to spend months and months in Scotland . What does Scotland mean to you , Milton ? Besides deer stalking ? " " Cashmere sweaters , plaids , whiskey , ah . . . shetland sweaters , tartans , Drambuie , ah . . . haggis , bagpipes , trout . . . kilts ! Leon , is this a quiz show ? " " Rain , cold , fog , wind , discomfort , lonely moors , the hound of the Baskervilles  --  ifCastle Dread does n't have central heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Leon , you have no vision . You panic too easily . There 's got to be a hotel somewhere and if not we 'll just camp out at Claridge 's and pop up to Scotland when it 's absolutely necessary . But I do wish Claridge 's had better lighting in the bathrooms . I can never see well enough to get a decent shave , but where else can we stay ? " " Nowhere , " Leon Ludwig sighed . " If we did , people might think we were slumming , and slumming in London is n't chic anymore , alas . " " I 'll tell my secretary to make reservations immediately . Maxi sounds desperate . She says she has to have the central heating in by next week and for some reason she ca n't seem to make the local contractor understand . This is a crisis , Leon . She needs us . " " Milton , when did n't Maxi need us ? We 're indispensable to her . " " Well , I just hope she 's settled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ! Really , Milton , you 've taken leave of your senses . Settled down , indeed ! " 180 Angelica ate her hamburger , looking , Rocco thought , more thoughtful than a seven-year-old should look . " Is there something wrong , sweetheart ? " he asked . " Oh , no , Daddy , I was just wondering if I liked Laddie as much as I liked Dennis , that 's all . " " Oh . " " Dennis was so funny but Laddie can play a twelve-string guitar and sing old songs ; Dennis taught me to swim but Laddie is going to get me a Shetland pony and teach me how to ride ; Dennis had a great big wonderful boat but Laddie has an enormous castle ; Dennis showed me how to play Go Fish and he always let me beat him but Laddie gave me a little red fishing rod and when the trout season comes he 's going to show me how to . . . " " It sounds as if they 're both simply perfect , two absolutely wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another hamburger , Angel- ica ? " " Oh , yes , please , Daddy . That 's one thing they ca n't make right in Monte Carlo or Scotland . I miss hamburgers . " " Really . " " Yes , and I miss tuna fish sandwiches and turkey with cranberry sauce , " Angelica said sadly . " Are those the only things that you miss , Angelica ? " " Well , I suppose I still miss Dennis , a little bit . I do n't know Laddie quite well enough yet to stop missing Dennis , even though Laddie 's so very very tall and so very very handsome . " " I see . " " That 's O.K. , Daddy , " Angelica assured him earnestly . " Maybe people always miss people they like , even when they meet other new people they like . " " Maybe . " " Please pass the ketchup , Daddy . Remember when Mommy was mar- Tied to Dennis ? Remember how every month Nanny and I used to take the helicopter from Monte Carlo to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the Concorde from Paris to New York to be with you ? But I was just a little kid then and I did n't have to learn things . Now I 'm in second grade and I ca n't change schools every month . " " I know , sweetheart . " " So once I start school in Scotland , I wo n't get to visit you until we have a vacation that 's long enough for me to come back to New York , " Angel- ica explained with a look of concern . " I understand , baby . Your mother and I discussed it for a long time and I had to agree with her that I could n't interrupt your schooling . " " But I 'm worried about you , Daddy . " " Why , Angelica ? " " Because you 're going to miss me . " " A lot , God damn it ! One hell of a lot . But you 'll have your mother and Laddie what's-his-name and a pony and a castle and probably dozens of pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be too busy to miss me , darling . " " I miss you all the time I 'm not with you , Daddy , " she said reproachfully . " More than Dennis ? " " Do n't be silly ! It 's not at all the same thing . I liked Dennis . I love you . " " I was just making a little joke . " " Well , I do n't think it was funny . Not at all ! Take it back , right away , " Angelica said severely . " I take it back , " Rocco mumbled . " O.K. Could I have a chocolate fudge sundae , please ? " " Of course . You can have anything you want . " " Well , I just hope that Mommy is going to stay settled down with Laddie this time . I do n't want to have to miss him too . " " Settled down ? Your mother ? Hal " " What does that ha ' mean , Daddy ? " " I was coughing , Angelica . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this letter from my mother , " Lily said in a tone of alarm , putting down her piece of buttered toast . " What 's bothering her ? " Zachary ate his egg patiently . " It 's Maxi . " " I know it 's Maxi . Obviously your mother 's too sensible to get upset about anything minor . What 's Maxi done now ? I assume people have gotten over being shocked about the indoor swimming pool she installed in the dungeon and the bathroom she insisted on for every bedroom , even though the castle is a historic monument . " " It 's nothing that petty . Mother says that Maxi 's becoming the talk of London and that 's not easy to do when you live in the Border Country . Apparently she 's giving house parties that last for weeks . " " Why the hell not ? " Zachary stopped eating in quick defense of his daughter . " It took her at least a year to get the old barrack modernized and decorated and it certainly cost her millions . Naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better way than surrounding herself with friends ? " " I suppose you 're right , Zachary , but it seems that her house parties are simply notorious . They say that Maxi is growing a huge crop of marijuana in the greenhouse and she fills the Kirkgordon Chalice that the Arch- bishop of Glasgow presented to the family in the fifteenth century with a never-ending supply of home-rolled , Good Lord , Mother writes joints '  --  I did n't think she knew that word  --  and that Maxi is running a high-stakes poker game every day including Sunday in the late earl 's trophy room . . . for heaven 's sake , dear , put down your butter knife . . . and that she lights great blazing fires on top of the castle tower to celebrate Saint Patrick 's Day and Columbus Day and Kosciusko Day and I Am an Amer- ican Day and every single other American holiday and the local fire de- partment ca n't get her to stop . She still persists in driving her Ferrari on the wrong side of the road and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited to visit her neighbors , the Duke and Duchess of Buccleuch at Bowhill House , she said that she was n't absolutely convinced that their Leonardo is authentic ! That 's quite unpardonable , Zachary , and , of course , untrue and she must have known it . " Lily flung the letter down in exasperation . " She 's unhappy , Lily . The marriage is n't working out . That 's what all this means and I 'm not surprised . I always thought that brute of a Kirkgordon was much too beautiful . I do n't trust men who look like that , and now he 's made her miserable . I admit that Maxi 's a little spoiled at times but she 's never been self-destructive , " Zachary said , taking off his glasses absently and shaking his head in concern . " The only part of that letter that seriously worries me is her driving on the wrong side of the road . I 'm going to phone her and find out what 's going on . I 'd just hoped , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time . " " I know you 're a doting father but there should be some limits to your wishful thinking . Settled down ' ? Your daughter ? Maxi ? Really , Zachary ! " " What was it exactly that went wrong this time , Maxi ? " India ques- tioned breathlessly . " Tell me everything , take it from the top . " " If you 'd ever been able to visit , you would n't have to ask . But you were too busy even to pop over for a weekend , " Maxi said accusingly . " So , here I am , back on the coast , just to see you . " " That 's a bum rap . I did n't have the time for jet lag in both directions and you know it perfectly well . It 's not as if you 've been living in San Francisco . Come on , stop stalling . " " Basically , it was the dreich . " " Of course it was , " India said soothingly . " What 's he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scots word , India , and it means very , very wet , very , very dark , very , very dim and very , very cold . The weather , India , the weather was fucking dreich . " Maxi reached over and took some pizza off of India 's plate . She was thin enough now to risk anything , and the pizza at Spago was irresistible . " So you got divorced for the third time because of the weather ? Interesting . This is the first time I 've heard that one . Of course , if you see enough Bergman movies you can begin to understand that gloomy weather does create a definite morbidity and melancholy , but in less than two years ? Maxi , leave my plate alone . Would n't you like to order your own pizza ? What about all those tons of central heating you put in ? " " India , what about being generous enough to share your pizza ? I gave you half my angel hair pasta , did n't I ? What if I told you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole world , that I should n't be allowed out by myself without a keeper ? " " I 'd be forced to disagree . Rocco was , as I well remember , one of the alltimegreats , Bad Dennis Brady was , in his own way , supremely delicious , and according to your letters Laddie Kirkgordon was sheer heaven . I quote : He has all the best points of King Arthur , Tarzan and Warren Beatty . ' Did n't his being an earl even account for something ? " " You try waking up in the middle of the night and telling yourself that you 're a countess and see how much difference that makes , " Maxi snapped . " And just why were you waking up in the middle of the night and talking to yourself ? " " All right , India , all right . I give up . I see you 've been taking Doctor Florence Florsheim lessons , getting right down to the roots of things , is n't that it ? " " More or less , " India answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunatic , " Maxi said , and fell silent . " That 's it ? That 's all there is to it ? Most men are lunatics , Maxi . Stark , raving lunatics . But you do n't divorce them because of it , you learn to live with them . That 's probably why I 've never married . I know too much up front , in advance . Laddie just was n't your kind of lunatic . " " Damn right , he was n't . I think he was an overreaction to poor Dennis , but in the beginning I really fell for it : that glorious tradition handed down from generation to generation ; the purpose in life ; the meaningfulness of being Scots , Scottish , Scotch , you can call it what you will ; ancestor worship , the House of Stuart , patriotism , I fell for the lot . But once we got out184 185of bed long enough for me to listen clearly to him , and that took a year , I found out I was much more of an American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite obsessed , and finally I realized he was decidedly mad , bonkers , living in another century . He refused to have anything to do with the real world , with one single exception : winning the Selkirk Silver Arrow  --  I think it 's the only thing he cares about . " " Huh ? " " It 's an archery trophy , the oldest there is , and every seven years there 's a competition of the Queen 's Bodyguard of Archers to win the Arrow . Laddie spent at least six hours every day practicing with his bow and do n't say it was just a hobby , it was life to him , even though the Queen he was doing it for was not Elizabeth the Second . If he 'd had better weather he 'd have spent more time at it than that , but what with the dreich and all ... " " Why did n't you bail out earlier ? Between the wet and the target practiceI do n't understand why you stuck around for so long . " " I was simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I never knew one of my three husbands for more than a month or two before I married him  --  I only knew poor , sweet , Bad Dennis for thirty-odd  --  very odd  --  hours , India . What does that tell you about me ? Do n't bother to answer . Do n't say one single word , that was n't a question . " " What did Angelica think ? " " Oh , she was having too good a time to notice that the laird was a wee bit peculiar . She loved the indoor swimming pool , she loved the local school and she really became quite good with a bow and arrow . Laddie gave her lessons , I 'll say that for him . Fortunately I got her out in time , before she started thinking that Bonnie Prince Charlie was going to come riding out of the mists on a white horse and carry her away . I believe Angelica could thrive underwater . I 'm the one who is n't adaptable . " " You 're just impulsive , " India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Doctor Florence Florsheim ? " Maxi asked with a look of despair . " You ca n't say that I 'm leading life in the fast lane  --  it feels like oncoming traffic . " " That happens to be the one kind of advice I ca n't give you . People in analysis are not supposed to go around telling their friends that they should go into analysis too . Anyway , Doctor Florsheim would n't take you because you 've heard too much about her and she knows too much about you , to say nothing of our being best friends . It would be strictly un-kosher . " " Do you talk to her about me ? " Maxi asked , with a delighted expression . " I did n't know that ! What do you say ? " " When I 'm trying to avoid talking about something I do n't want to talk about , I do have a tendency to discuss you , yes . But since you 're not one of my problems it 's just another waste of my time and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's because I 'm avoiding something really awful . " " Oh . " " Do n't try to understand . " " I wo n't , India , I truly promise not to . " " What do you intend to do now , Maxi ? " " First of all I 'm going to make you a solemn and binding commitment , India . I 'm going to vow , with you as my witness , that I will never , ever marry another man . Never ever another man , India , do you hear ? " " I hear but I do n't believe you . Just because you do n't intend to get married again does n't mean that you wo n't . You 're too young to make such a vow . I warn you not to do it . " " You let me decide that ! India , if I get married to another man I 'll . . . I 'll take out an ad , a full-page ad , saying that I 'm not responsible for my actions , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm doing it against my better judgment , that I 'm acting in haste and will repent in leisure , that I 'm sure in advance that it 's going to turn out to be a mistake and that you , India West , are my witness , the only one in the world who knows that I have made a vow to myself , an absolute vow , never , ever to marry another man . " " Where will the ad run ? " India asked through her fit of giggles . " In the New York Times , in . . . in Women 's Wear Daily , in the New York Post , in the London Times , in Le Figaro  --  that should cover just about everybody I know , do n't you think ? " " Weekly Variety too , " India suggested . " You 've met a few people in the business . " " Done . I 'm absolutely dead serious about this , India . " " I know you are . Oh , Maxi , I did hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " India , me ? You should know better than that ! " n spite of the discouragement inwhich she had briefly wallowed over the weekend and on the phone with India , Maxi approached the offices of Buttons and Bows on Monday with a tickle of irrepressible excitement . After her long therapeutic talk with her best friend she had convinced herself that the former editor , Bob Fink , was simply too superannuated to understand that something could be made ol her magazine , no matter how low it had fallen . He did n't believe in ii anymore , if indeed he ever had , he had no competitiveness left , he lacked vision , he had made too much money in real estate to be hungry for improvement , except when it was time for his daily free lunch , Maxi assuredherself as she opened the door to the suite of offices , a door that she resolved to have painted as soon as possible . She stood inside and surveyed the unprepossessing chamber . On the walls of the reception area were framed covers of Trimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine on which Zachary Amberville built his empire . The old-fashioned covers from the forties and fifties just reinforced her conviction that bringing the magazine back to life was a question of using her imagination . The skimpy , recent issue of Buttonsand Bows that she had put into her handbag and taken home had a cover that was basically similar to those on the walls . Surely something as important as a cover could have been , should have been , totally changed in the course of forty years ? " Miss Amberville , welcome to hard times . " Maxi spun around . It was the receptionist who had announced her arrivallast week . " You 're still here ? Bob Fink said everyone could n't wait to leave . " " My salary is paid through the end of the week , and I 'm not old enough to retire . " " What 's your name ? " " Julie Jacobson . " " Call me Maxi , " she said , sitting down in front of the battered desk . " About your clothes , Julie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I guess that would be best , " Julie answered carefully . They were wearing identical outfits : miniskirts in a screaming red , with crisp white blouses and exaggeratedly long , black men 's ties around their necks . They both had on black tights and high-heeled black pumps . A wool Chesterfield that matched the skirt was hanging behind the receptionist'sdesk . Maxi was wearing its double . The ensemble was Stephen Sprouse 's newest , freshest , and brightest , exactly what a fashion addict with superb legs would choose to wear on this particular day of this particularmonth of this particular year . Since they were roughly the same height , the two young women looked absolutely alike from the chin down . " I think we should stop meeting like this , " Maxi said , " or else try to make a point of it . " Bob Fink had said that his receptionist was overpaid but this suit and blouse had cost over a thousand dollars , not counting the shoes . Just how overpaid was she ? Julie was Maxi 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that meant she would always look taller than Maxi in the same clothes . Her short hair was tinted an otherworldly color between Bordeaux and orange that stopped precisely short of punk . It was brushed back uncompromisinglyfrom her forehead to reveal a face that belonged to an impertinent doe : huge challenging eyes , darkly rimmed in charcoal liner and shadow ; a slender nose with nostrils so sensitive that they looked as if they could twitch at any minute ; delicate lips painted a bright crimson ; a chin that was just small enough to give the impression that she shared some forest animal 's timidity and yet firm enough to let the world know that Julie Jacobson did n't let anyone order her around . " But let 's discuss wardrobe later , " Maxi continued . " I 'm going to look around my office . Then maybe you could show me the rest of the establish-ment ? " Julie sprang up and stood with her back protectively barring the door that led to Uncle Bob Fink 's former office . " I do n't think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't ? " " It might not be the best way to start the day . " " Do n't tell me he did n't get rid of all his stuff , " Maxi sputtered . " He promised , damn it . " " No , it 's all been carted away . " " Then what 's the problem ? " Maxi said blithely as she entered . She stopped in her tracks in shock . The room was completely empty , except for one old black leather chair with a rump-sprung seat . The entire carpet was covered , many inches deep , with layer upon layer of half-disintegrated bits of paper , a mess ten188times worse than Broadway after a ticker-tape parade . Cobwebs , she thought in a daze , real honest-to-God cobwebs hung in the corners of the room . Did New York have spiders ? The walls , now that Uncle Bob 's nine towering desks no longer concealed them , were mottled and filthy . There had been leaks over the years and paint had fallen from the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other debris . The windows were so dirty that scarcely any sun lit up the scene , but whatever light came through the grime was desolate . " At least in Great Expectations Miss Havisham had furniture to hold up her cobwebs , " Maxi said when she could find her voice . " The last desk , the one he was working at , collapsed when they tried to move it , " Julie explained . " There is n't a broom , there is n't a vacuum cleaner , there is n't any instrumentknown to man that could clean up this . . . I do n't even know what to call it , " Maxi said faintly . " There 's always motivation . " Julie sounded as if she 'd meditated on the problem . " Motivation ? " Maxi was horrified . " You do n't mean me ! " " In our clothes ? I was thinking of Hank , from the building . He 's been known to become highly motivated by the palm of his hand . Do you have fifty bucks ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think so . Will he take a credit card ? " " I 'll lend it to you . You can pay me back tomorrow . " " Bless you , Julie ! Let 's get out of here . It 's morbid . " " You 're the boss . " " Right ? Right ! Now where can the boss sit down and discuss the future of Buttons and Bows with her staff ? " " Maxi , you do n't have a staff . " " What about you ? " " No way . I do n't mind lending you money , but that 's as far as it goes . I 'm purely temporary , not staff , God forbid , in this place . " " Could n't you just pretend ? Till the end of the week . You could put it on your resume , when you go for your next job . " " I am planning on leaving Buttons and Bows off my resume entirely . But if it makes you feel any better , you can call me a consultant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheer us both up . Do n't look for a coffee maker , it 's broken . " " The nearest coffee shop ? " " You 're on . " " Julie , " Maxi said earnestly , leaning over the table , " have you ever stopped to think of the possibilities ? Every rock group in the world istrimming-crazy , tons of gold braid , uniforms , everything they wear is trimmed to high heaven . Medals are back all over the place . Shoulder pads have never been more important . Claude Montana . Just think of Claude Montana 's shoulder pads ! The T-shirt craze . What is punk but the inspired use of trimming ? And just look at the evening dresses this year . . . if they do n't glitter , forget them . Sonia Rykiel 's things  --  all trim . Why , we could do a whole issue on . . . on Joan Collins 's puffed sleeves ! " " Hmmm . " " What does that mean ? " " I 've only been here two weeks because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mademoiselle fell through at the last minute , but I do know who still subscribes to Buttons and Bows . Basically , it 's your Mr. Lucas who is worried about selling five thousand yards of passementerie and your Mr. Spielberg whose main business in life is fringe . I do n't think they would be intensely fascinated by Joan Collins 's sleeves . They would hardly notice if Joan Collins herself appeared stark naked on the cover of the magazine . Buttons and Bows , if it 's about anything , is about a few of the nuts and bolts of the fashion business . For fashion , Spielberg and Lucas stick to WWD . That 's not subject to change by you . " " Then we have to widen our base of circulation , appeal to somebody other than Lucas and Spielberg . " " Not we , Maxi , you , " Julie insisted . " You . " " Anyway , that 's tomorrow 's problem , " Maxi said , pushing it away into the air . " Tell me about you . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm twenty-two . I graduated from Smith last year . My mother always insisted that I have secretarial skills to fall back on . For three generations the women of my family have had secretarial skills and I 'm the first one who 's ever had to fall back on them . I do not enjoy it . In two weeks I 'm starting at Redbook as assistant to the assistant to the fashion editor . " " Are you a New Yorker ? " Maxi asked curiously . Julie was as businesslikea creature as she 'd ever met and crisply self-confident . " Cleveland , Shaker Heights . My father 's a neurosurgeon and my mother teaches English literature at the university . Her speciality is VirginiaWoolf and the Bloomsbury Group . My sister 's working for a double Ph.D . in French and philosophy so that she can teach Pascal , Montaigne and Voltaire , heaven only knows to whom , and my brother 's a city planner and chief aide to the mayor of Cleveland . I 'm my parents ' only failure . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the color of her hair . Everything else about her was so impressive . " I 'm nuts about fashion . No one in the Jacobson family thinks fashion isa proper way to spend the only life you have . It 's frivolous , poorly paid , and does n't add to universal knowledge . " " It 's the fourth or fifth biggest industry in the country . " " They do n't think much of industry either . " " They sound a bit . . . Bostonian . " " There 's another branch of the family that 's lived in Boston forever . They make the Cleveland Jacobsons look like television game show pro- ducers . " " I did n't even graduate from high school , " Maxi confessed . " Is that why you 've been sent to Buttons and Bows  --  to teach you what happens to people who fail to complete their education ? " " It was my own idea . And I 'm not giving it up , " Maxi said grimly . " I do n't understand why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happens to pathetic old Buttons and Bows . In your place I 'd be at Style like a shot . " " Let 's talk about clothes , " Maxi suggested . She liked Julie but she was n't about to bare her heart and her loss to satisfy her curiosity . The reasons were too emotional , too bound up with her love for her father to explain . " Clothes Milan ? Clothes Bendel 's ? Clothes American designers ? " Julie 's eyes lit up with anticipation . " You 're buying the coffee so you get to pick , " Maxi said generously . For several hours that afternoon Maxi sat in what had once been the art department , where two bare L-shaped layout tables and several tottering chairs had been abandoned on a dirty , peeling linoleum floor . In the recep- tion room , from time to time , she could hear Julie answering the phone and coping with the reluctantly motivated maintenance man . Maxi had supplied herself with a yellow legal pad and a box of ballpoint pens and she decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot the future of a new , revitalized , expanded , explosive Buttons and Bows . She had the intention of making lists and sketches and more lists and more sketches . She walked around the room , looked out of the window , sat down , looked at her yellow legal pad , got up and walked around the room some more . Inspiration proved elusive . Maybe it was the fault of the decor , maybe it was the terrible ham-and-cheese sandwiches she and Julie had shared in a coffee shop that had been sold out of her favorite , tuna salad , maybe it was the antics of the full moon or the diabolical influence of Saturn or maybe it just was n't her day . Maybe it was Lucas and Spielberg . She wished that Julie had never told her about them . None of the ideas that came into her head seemed good when viewed from the Lucas- Spielberg angle , and they were , after all , the faithful core that was left of the readers of Buttons and Bows . The magazine , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal to many thousands of Lucases and Spielbergs , wherever they were to be found . Hundreds of thousands . Millions ! " Jesus Christ Almighty ! " Maxi said out loud . " You spoke ? " Julie asked , standing in the doorway . " There are n't millions of Lucases and Spielbergs ! " " One of each , I believe . On your subscription list in any case . " " Julie , I 'm going for a walk . I think better on my feet . " " It 's nice outside , " Julie said , eyeing the virgin yellow pad meaningfully . " Oxygen stimulates the brain . " " And it 's nice outside . See you tomorrow . " Elie was waiting with the limo downstairs . " The center of the universe , Elie , " she ordered . He made his rapid , illegal way to the corner of Fifty-seventh and Fifth , stopped and opened the door for her . " When will you need me tonight , Miss Amberville ? " " I 'm not sure , Elie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down Fifth Avenue , breathing deeply , relishing the nimble temper of the September city , that perpetual urban high-wire act . She loved the incomparable tension of this island metropolis that felt as if it were perched on the top of an active volcano . " ' I ' 11 take Manhattan , the Bronx and Staten Island too , ' " Maxi sang , although she had known for years that the song her father had taught her had been skewed to suit his determination since the first three words of the lyric really were " We 'll have Manhattan . " Never had Fifth Avenue seemed broader or brighter to her than after the dismal hours she 'd spent in her new office , never had the passing throng , pushing and shoving and overtaking each other in the aggressive , con brio New York version of a stroll , seemed more fascinating and varied than after the fruitless afternoon she 'd spent with her yellow pad . Everyonehad a destination , a goal , a reason for being here , in this place , on this street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what did they all want ? Wanting was the very essence of the New Yorker . She knew what she wanted . She wanted to make a smashing success of Buttons and Bows and quite suddenly she admitted to herself that she knew it could not be done . Not with Buttons and Bows . No way , nohow . There was no major demand in this city , where there was a market for everything , for a magazine that was devoted to articles , no matter how well executed , on the mystery of the hand-embroideredglitz on Julio 's three-thousand-dollar dresses or the ruffles on192 193Prince 's clothes or the definitive word on Linda Evans 's paillettes . Probablythere was a market for a magazine for contact lens wearers , or a magazine for left-handed people , perhaps even a magazine for people who collected string , but they would always be small magazines . Maxi was n't about to pour her energy into a small magazine . Scratch trimming , she thought . She needed to find a new idea  --  a  --  a concept . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she almost danced down Fifth Avenue , in her red miniskirt , a smile on the perfect bow of her mouth . Just a new concept , merely a new , fresh concept that had n't already been done . That was all . As she sped by , every man who saw her ached to follow . When Elie called in tonight she 'd tell him that tomorrow morning she wanted him to make the rounds of all the newsstands in the city and bring her a copy of every single magazine on sale . She might as well know what was out there already before she invented her new magazine . " Ma , " said Angelica in a voice of supplication , " when are you going to stop torturing yourself ? I ca n't take this much longer . " " Tough shit , kid . " " Ma , that 's not a nice way to talk to your little girl . " " I do n't have time to be nice . If you want a nice person go find somebodyelse , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to me ? " " Because . And stop whining . . . other girls have working mothers and they do n't complain . " " Working mothers ! " Angelica sputtered . " You 're like some kind of loony , a robot , a crazed robot . " " Go play Trivial Pursuit . " " You 've been shut up with these magazines for three days now , you have n't had more than a bite to eat , you read till you drop , you grind your teeth when you 're asleep ... " " How do you know ? " " Because you fell asleep on top of that pile of magazines last night and I heard you grinding away . " " Just a little stress , just normal stress , Angelica . " " But you 've always avoided stress , you hate stress , Ma . Stop it ! " " To be stressed is human , kid , do n't you know that ? Maybe you 're too young , but according to what I read , every female in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even as we sit here and waste time talking . Now go away and let me get back to my work . " " Ma , I 'm going to call Toby and get you committed to an institution . " " It takes three doctors to commit somebody and all the doctors in the country are busily writing articles on stress for magazines , so you wo n't find any who have the time , but you 're free to try . " Angelica folded her lanky frame in sections and sat down protectively next to Maxi . Three days before , when Elie had arrived at the apartment with the first shift of magazines , her mother had been like a kid opening Christmas presents . She had installed herself in her new library , with its solar-gray mirrored walls , its book-crowded shelves and its big armchairs covered in off-white glove leather . She had opened each new magazine with anticipation , pounced on it and leafed through it page by page , leavingout nothing from cover to cover . When she had wrung a magazine dry Maxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of different types of magazines that were beginning to collect around her . Elie kept returning from his expeditions with his arms piled high . From expectation , Maxi 's mood grew more subdued . By lunch she began to look slightly dismayed and by the end of that first day she was annoyed . By the evening of the following day she had progressed to outrage , and her outrage had mounted ever since . Still the magazines kept coming , the piles now tumbling down the sides of all but the window wall of the room . Many of them had been sent away , carried off by the weary Elie : the only-for-men magazines ; the sports magazines ; the computer magazines ; the car-owner magazines ; the audio-freak magazines ; the motorcycle-nut magazines ; the weekly news magazines ; the movie magazines ; the soapoperafan magazines ; the magazines for male homosexuals ; the aerospace magazines ; the business magazines of all kinds and sorts . Maxi had , by now , cleared a place for herself on the red and white handloomedcarpet and sat cross-legged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't found one for lesbians yet , " she said in a tired but thoughtful tone of voice . " Ma ! Is that what you 're planning ? " " It may be the only major virgin market left . " " Would lesbians go out to a newsstand and buy a special magazine ? " Angelica wondered . She heard the front door open . It must be Elie with more dreaded magazines , because the footsteps were those of a man . " In a country with fifty-nine million single people and a magazine like Bride 's that claims to reach just over three million , it stands to reason that there 's got to be a big lesbian audience out there somewhere , " Maxi answered , trying for a tone of sweet reasonableness . A man entered the carpeted library where they sat so engrossed in print194 that they did n't hear him . He stood leaning on the doorjamb , casually poised . The mocking cock of his head , the tough jut of his chin , the skepti- cal glint in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pointy , ash-blond hair stood up from his head , all indicated someone who viewed the world with a certain disdain . He wore battered leather so worn that it seemed a collection of bits and pieces , three Nikons were slung around his neck , and his smile was both knowing and deeply loving . It was evident that he found both Maxi and Angelica very funny , objects of his benevo- lence , and it was just as evident that only a very few people in the world fell into that category . " Could I interest you ladies in a subscription to Boy 's Life ? " he said quietly . " Justin ! " Maxi whooped and launched herself across the room into his arms , scattering magazines in every direction . " Justin , you beast , where the fuck have you been for a year , you rotten bastard , you shithead ! Justin , darling ! " " Give me a chance at him , " Angelica cried , and grabbed him tightly , trying to climb up him like a monkey as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost toppling him over in the process . Eventually he extricated himself from the two excited , babbling creatures , separated them and put an arm around each of them . " Let 's look at you , " Justin said , and they immediately fell silent and subjected themselves to his scrutiny . " Still the ultimate best in the kingdom , " he said after a few seconds . He inspected his sister and his niece keenly , his dark gray eyes missing nothing , but whatever his real thoughts were he kept them , as always , to himself . Soon after Zachary Amberville died so suddenly , so horribly , Justin had taken off without a word to any member of his family . He had a record of disappearing for months at a time since he was fifteen , and the Ambervilles had become accustomed to his comings and goings . He never wrote or telephoned while he was away but , from time to time , photographs would crop up in a variety of publications with the photo credit " Justin " : photo- graphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , from mountaintops so unexplored that they had no names , from jungles that were only empty space on most maps ; photographs of surfers in Australia , of Brazilian transvestites in the Bois de Boulogne , of the inside of the Royal Enclosure at Ascot ; photographs that had nothing to connect them to each other except the unexpected viewpoint of the brain beyond the lens of the camera that captured images that could n't be skipped over , even in an era when it seemed that the most extraordinary photographs must all have been taken . His last " trip , " as the family called Justin 's mysterious wanderings , had been longer than any other he had made , and his photographs had been infrequent , but still no one worried , for by now it was accepted as a fact that Justin was invulnerable . In his early teens , he had seemed utterly ill at ease in his own skin , jumpy , awkward , and seeking every opportunity to avoid attention . Then , when he was twelve , he had started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relentless training that had reminded Lily of the single-mindedness of the ballet . Slowly Justin 's bearing , even when he stood still , began to convey an unstated menace . Everything that had earlier seemed vague and alienated in him had been collected into the strength and speed with which he knew he could move . Today he was a presence to reckon with , all dexterity , all sinewy grace ; a man of twentyfour , of medium height , whose lean body nevertheless had more density than that of other young men . Justin looked both lionhearted and unpredictable although he disdained any outward trappings of toughness . His familiar leathers were not studdedbody armor , just relaxed , well-worn , shabby garments in which he could travel anywhere . When he could be coaxed into a game of croquet in Southampton he exuded the same potential for dauntlessness , wearing white linen trousers and a pastel crew sweater ; the quality was built into his hard muscles , into his lack of relaxation , as if he were ready to do battle at any minute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenderness , yet she often realized that she knew remarkably little about her younger brother although they loved each other unreservedly . He was the most highly defended man she had ever met and whatever went on behind his high rounded forehead , whatever unspoken need made him drift away from home so often was a bafflement to her . Even Toby , with the acuity of his senses , with his way of reading unspoken thoughts , had no clues to the perplexing conundrum of Justin 's motivations . It seemed to both of them that he stalked some invisible goal that eluded them , a goal he never had explained , never had described , yet a goal that inexorably lured him on and on . " What , " Justin demanded , grinning , " are the two of you doing ? I want an explanation . Toby said I 'd find you here but he did n't say in what condition . He said you 'd tell me all about it . " " Ma 's looking for a new magazine concept , " Angelica answered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to make sure she does n't starve to death in the process . The new cook quit yesterday . " " Maxi , why ? " Justin said , astonished . " Who needs another magazine ? " " I 'm not sure yet , that 's the problem . But the rock-bottom reason has to do with Cutter , and a matter of not letting him make an ass out of me . " " In that case , you can count on my full cooperation , " Justin said with as much overt ferocity in his voice as he ever displayed . While Maxi and Toby could have explained in detail what they dis- trusted and disliked in their uncle , only Justin had always hated Cutter and yet could not have said why . It was an instinctive loathing that went too deep for words , a question of absolute mutual antipathy . Justin had been curious , as they all were , about his father 's brother who never seemed to leave San Francisco . When Justin was almost eleven , Cutter and Can- dice Amberville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days on their way to Europe . The first time Justin met Cutter his curiosity had been transformed into a visceral disgust , a disgust he did n't try to under- stand . It existed as solidly as a boulder , it was not something to question or ponder , it just was , as powerful as his love for Zachary , as obvious as his caring for Toby and Maxi . " I accept your offer , " Maxi said delightedly . For the last three days Angelica had been her only sounding board . Julie was busy at the office winding up the business of putting Buttons and Bows into the limbo where all dead magazines still float , items of rare , plaintive nostalgia and trivia quizzes . Maxi had not called on any of the professionals at Amberville Publications who would have been glad to lend her a hand . Pride had prevented her , pride and an irresistible need to do this thing by herself , to see it through to the absolute end and then , if she ran dry after giving it her unreserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to lean on the obviously available expertise of Pavka or Nina or Linda Lafferty , or any of many others who were among the editorial board members . She was twenty-nine and she 'd never accomplished much alone in her life except bringing up Angelica . However , Justin 's help was different . He was family . " Where do we start ? " Justin asked , shedding several layers of soft leather and making a place for himself on the floor with Maxi and Angel- ica . " Do n't you want to know why I 'm looking for a concept ? " Maxi de- manded . " Not necessarily , as long as it has to do with screwing Cutter . How far have you come ? Do you have a glimmer of a glimmer ? " " I know what I ca n't do . I have eliminated all the glossy magazines : the Vogues and Architectural Digests and House &; Gardens . Not only are they too expensive to publish , but Amberville already has Style and Indoors and I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so angry ! " " Since when ? I thought you loved them . " " I used to , I was addicted to my monthly fix of slippery paper , but the more I looked at them , the more I read them , the more furious I got . Justin , do you realize that the glossy books just make you feel like a piece of junk ? Almost nobody can look like that ; wear those damn clothes ; use that crazy new makeup ; have houses like that or gardens like that .. . you can aspire , you can spend the rest of your life trying to be someone photographed in that one perfect minute , which is the only thing they ever show , but you 'll never make it for real . They 're not selling dreams , they 're selling putdowns . They 're selling heartache , dissatisfaction with what you have , above all they 're selling envy . " " Hey , Maxi , take it easy . They 're selling clothes and furniture and cosmetics . . . the editorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the wheels of American business turn . You know that as well as I do . " " That does n't make me like them , " Maxi said obdurately . " But you are their reader , you of all people . You know perfectly well that you can buy just about anything that you see in those magazines . Look at this apartment . . . four million dollars , or was it five ? Look in your overstuffed closets , look in your jewel box , and then take a good look in the mirror . Just what do n't you have ? Except for a fourth husband ? " " I 'm thinking about my readers , " Maxi said impatiently . " Oh , so you have readers do you ? I knew there was something different about this place but I thought it was the view . " " I intend to have them , Justin , and I 'm not going to give them another overdose of how rich people live . " " Bravo ! What other kinds of magazines have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity piqued by her vehemence . " All those damn service books : Good House , Family Circle , Woman 's Day , Redbook , McCall 's , and anything else that digs , digs and digs some more at every woman 's guilt . Just look at this Ladies ' Home Journal ad . . . they surveyed 86,000 women and eighty-seven percent of them said that women can do anything . ' " " Well , ca n't they ? You 've always acted as if you thought you could . " " Look what else it says  --  We 're here as she presses herself for physical excellence . Offering her sensible diet , exercise and beauty plans . . . and we 're there as she presses to be better in other ways too . At home . On the job . In her community . . . pressing just as hard for excellence as the seventeen and a half million women who read us every month . ' It 's a big , lousy , fucking conspiracy , a tyranny , Justin , no poor bitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in all situations . Press on , press on , and if you drop dead from sheer pressing for excellence , at least you wo n't have let your subscription lapse ! " " Angelica , go get your mother a Miltown . " " It 's all right , Justin , I just gave her one . It does n't help . Can it kill you to foam at the mouth ? " " I doubt it , sweetheart , your mother 's just suffering from stress . " " Justin , " Angelica shrieked in alarm , " please do n't use that word . " " Oh , balls , " Maxi muttered , throwing down a copy of Family Circle . " It 's only September , and they 've got 101 Christmas Gifts to Make ' and All-Time Favorite Cookie Recipes ' on the cover and Doctor Art Ulene 's book on How to Stop Family Problems Before They Start . . . . What if you do n't bake , what if you buy your presents and do n't want to know more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How guilty will this cover make you feel ? And it 's the world 's largest- selling women 's magazine according to the masthead . And look at this magazine , just look . It 's called Lady 's Circle and it 's really a joyful book : a piece on stomach-stapling that did n't work , an article about a teenager with a rare , fatal liver disease , another stress article that contains a test on how you rate as a heart-attack victim ; and then , for fun , how to crochet a holiday tablecloth . Is crochet a stress antidote ? Or a stress add-on ? " " Maxi , why are you even bothering with service books ? " Justin asked . " That 's not exactly your line of country . I 've never seen you making any- thing more complicated than a vodka gimlet and I remember your being furious that limes had seeds . " " I have to know what people are buying , what women are reading , or I wo n't know what to give them that they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she had suddenly turned into a toadstool . " It 's obvi- ous . " " But you ca n't be planning to compete with a Good House . . . . Where are your test kitchens , Maxi , where 's your money-back guarantee , where 's your well-earned readers ' confidence ? Where 's your reputation for excel- lence and your position as a trusted friend , not a magazine ? " " Justin , how come you know so much ? " Maxi inquired suspiciously . " I had lunch with someone from Hearst once , " he said evasively . " I like to bake cookies , " Angelica announced . " Could I have that copy of Woman 's Day , Ma ? " " With my blessings , " Maxi said , smiling for the first time that morning . She turned to Justin and raised astonished eyebrows . Baking cookies ? " What 's in that pile ? " he asked , pointing to the heap of magazines closest to her . " I call them the so what else is wrong with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are going so badly that you 're desperate for help . Here we have Woman and Complete Woman , with typical cover lines : Why Do You Let Him Walk All Over You ? ' ; Beat Those Menstrual Blahs ' ; Conquering Your Shyness ' ; If Sex Leaves You Wondering " What 's Wrong with Me ? " ' ; So You Are Not Interested in Sex . .. ' ; Banish Boredom , Overcome Hurts , Fight Insecurity , Beat Loneliness ' ; How to Save Yourself from Yourself . ' I could go on . . . " " Do n't ! Please do n't . Or I 'll scream , " Justin said , unable to repress a guffaw . " Ma 's overreacting , " Angelica whispered to him . " The hell I am , " Maxi snapped . " I 'm just seeing what 's being sold on the newsstands and having normal reactions . " " Like grinding your teeth in your sleep ? " Angelica asked . " Precisely ! How about this piece on The Number-One Stress Stopper ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Relaxation ? " asked Justin . " Deep breathing and chocolate cake ? " Angelica hazarded . " No , no , my children . . . Do More . . . or How to Be a Confirmed , Happy , Unapologetic Overachiever . ' That SUCKS ! " Maxi flopped on the floor and groaned aloud . " Do More , ' the man says . More . " " Let me rub your back , Maxi , it 's probably killing you , " Justin said , rolling up his sleeves and flexing his strong fingers . " How about a brownie , Ma ? They say chocolate makes you happy , releases some kind of hormone or something , " Angelica suggested anxiously . " No , do n't try to make me feel better . " Maxi jumped up from the carpet and picked up the magazines around her and pitched them violently at the magazines that were piled against the walls . " Enough guilt ! Enough of your guilt trips about everything from your extra pounds to how you 've changed your lover into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know about how to handle money , about how you ca n't accessorizeyour clothes , keep a neat closet , do n't take enough calcium , have n't been promoted at work , ca n't manage a job and a family too , and need your marriage saved ; enough about your nutrition mistakes and how to handle failure ; enough about how boring your sex life is and it 's probably your fault ; enough guilt about your whole life being depressing and why men are unwilling to commit ; enough about why you fuck up job interviews . . . . No more guilt trips ! " " We agree , do n't we , Justin ? " Angelica said hurriedly as Maxi whirled around faster and faster but Maxi did n't hear her and kept on talking200 201louder and louder , her bare feet thudding on the thick carpet like enraged hooves . " All they do is undermine your self-confidence while trying to tell you how to be , seem , and feel more self-confident ; they make you feel that it 's impossible for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and should be doing better , better , better , in the kitchen , the bedroom , the boardroom  --  what , you mean you have n't been promoted yet ? How come you 're not an executive and if so what horrible things does your office furniture reveal about your character and when will you learn how to manipulate your boss and make office politics pay ? And if you do n't work , how come you are n't at home making a new kind of stuffing for the turkey , how come you 're such a poor pathetic creature that without this magazine you 'd never make it through the night ? Oh , thank them  --  thank the good editors for making you feel better about that heel you married , the dozen men who 've left you , the seventeen different things you do wrong in bed , the only man  --  naturally a shit  --  whom you ca n't forget ; all of which are your fault , bad girl . BAD GIRL ! Guilt , guilt , guilt ! WOULD ANY MAN BUY A MAGAZINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No , my children , he would not . If I read one more article about bulimia I 'll throw up .

" No , after . " " Does n't any magazine like women ? " Justin ventured . Maxi jumped up and down . " THAT 'S IT ! That is fucking it ! The reader-friendly magazine , the magazine that loves you and does n't try to change you , the magazine that wants to amuse you , that exists for your pleasure and only your pleasure . FUN . The magazine that does n't give a shit if you eat too much or ca n't find a guy , or should have known better or need help . Fun , I say !

FUN ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms wide and jumped up and down , flinging the last of the magazines away , kicking as high as any Texas cheerleader , strutting her stuff . " We heard you , Ma . Everybody in Trump Tower heard you . " " What is this fun book going to be called ? " Justin said with a flashing look of pleasure at the sight of his adored sister back to normal form again . " It 's already got a name , Justin . I picked Buttons and Bows when I had my chance . But times have changed , " Maxi said gleefully , " and so has the name . I 'm shortening it to B and B. " B and B ? What kind of name is that ? " Angelica asked . " Do I know ? Does it matter ? Bread and Butter , Bosoms and Bottoms , Benedictine and Brandy , Balls and Bums , whatever suits your fancy . It 's called B and B and that means F-U-N ! " Zap-proof Fucking zap-proof ! " Rocco said , angrily throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked out of the window of his office on the forty-third floor of Dag Hammarskjold Plaza and noted with annoyance the red neon sign of the Pepsi bottling plant on the other side of the East River . Coca-Cola was his client and Pepsi was the loathed enemy , until the almost certain day when Pepsi would become the client and Coke the enemy . " Anyway , " he added , " this story is totally sick . Imagine having to go for zap-proof by shooting eight and a half hours of film and editing it down to a thirty-second televisionspot . No matter how good it might turn out to be , I say it 's a sign of something fundamentally wrong . " " We have nothing to do with that spot , Rocco , " Rap Kelly said soothingly . " It 's for somebody 's deodorant soap . You should stop reading the trades . " " Do n't turn into a philosopher , Rocco , " added Man Ray Lefkowitz , the third partner of the firm of Cipriani , Lefkowitz and Kelly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you give the public remote-controlunits for their TV sets , it stands to reason that they 're going to zap the commercials . " " If it had been us , I 'd have killed whoever directed that soap commercialwith my bare hands , " Rocco said somberly . " Hitchcock he was n't . " Manny and Rap exchanged glances . Was Rocco going into another of his occasional phases which they privately called **27;14796;TOOLONG ? When the two of them had lured him away from Conde Nast three years ago it had been the hardest selling job either of them had ever gone through , including the battle to get the Chevrolet account . Rocco had n't wanted to admit that magazines were dodo birds as far as getting graphics to the attention of the masses was concerned . He had wanted to stay buried in print forever , Rocco had , until together they 'd wrestled him out of his fixation . Manny Lefkowitz , that brilliant copywriter , still remembered his winningargument . " Rocco , " he 'd said , " it takes more time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly when you 've paid for a magazine , than it does to zap a commercial , since it is your right , as an American , to see a commercial coming at you for free every time you turn on the television . Who 's the bigger challenge to an art director ? The willingconsumer , the veritable captive audience of a magazine who 's intent on amortizing his investment , or the absolutely fed-up-with-commercials audiencewatching television who only wants the show to come back on ? Do n't bother to answer  --  it 's obvious . So if you 're the best art director in the world , as Rap and I think you are , then television advertising is the only medium worthy of you . It 's your next step , Rocco , you ca n't help but admit that . " " I admit it . . . but I just do n't know . . . where 's the white space , Man Ray , where 's the layout ? " " On that blank screen , Rocco , and you know it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . . . millions and millions more . And you have to sell them something , not just entertain them . The major difference , Rocco , is that magazine layouts are essentially the print equivalent of jerking off  --  all you 're doing to making pretty pages for the advertisers to plant their ads around . . . it 's pure self-indulgence . With commercials you live or die in that split second before forty percent of the viewing audience decides to zap you . So you have to be better than in print . Not just good , great . " " Jerking off ? " Rocco said , offended . " With all due apologies to the magazine business , it 's a century behind its time . A page does n't move or speak to you and nothing is ever going to make it do so . Get off the pot , Rocco , do n't be like that guy who said nobody would ever go to talkies . " " Yeah , Rocco , do n't be totally dumb , " Rap Kelly chimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threesome , who specialized in being indecentlysmarter than he sounded , and won many an account that tooslicktalk had lost . Rocco had looked at the two of them , Manny , the monster-talented chief copywriter and vice-president at BBD &O,; and Rap , who was the king of the hill at Young and Rubicam , and realized that the adventure of starting a new advertrising agency with these two advertising geniuses was irresistible . The top creative agency job that they were proposing to him had never before been offered to a Madison Avenue art director . Traditionallythat job always went to someone who came up through the copy department . He had been thirty-three then and , except for his brief experience at Amberville Publications , he 'd always worked for Conde Nast . But his idol , 204 205Alexander Liberman , was going as strong as ever , showing no signs of age , and Rocco suddenly felt that perhaps the time had come to move away from the printed page , at least for a time ; perhaps Manny and Rap were right about the challenge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazines had a chance of making the money that he knew he could make in an ad agency and it was time to think realistically about money . From the time Rocco and Maxi had been divorced , only a little more than nine years before , he had chosen not to think about money , knowing that it was un-American and unnatural and in some basic way ridiculous not to think about money , as if he 'd taken some sort of vow . It was more difficult to work in New York and not think about money than it was not to think about sex or food , but for someone whose life had been as screwed up by money  --  Maxi 's money  --  as his had been , it was a revolting topic . And he 'd been right about the money he 'd make . CL &K,; as their new agency was known , was a gold mine from the day it opened its door . They pulled down out of trees clients that supposedly belonged to the venerable giants of Madison Avenue as if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500 companies beat at their doors before they 'd finishedraiding the other agencies in town for much of their prime talent , for Cipriani , Lefkowitz and Kelly had something extra going for them that no other agency in town had : all three were bachelors without attachments . And much of the prime Madison Avenue talent was female . Man Ray Lefkowitz was a jolly redheaded giant with violently blue eyes which he insisted were a sign that he was of some special tribe directly descended from the Queen of Sheba ; and Kelly was a redheaded Irishman with violentlyblue eyes who had been an all-American quarterback for UCLA and could sing tear-bringing whorehouse tenor when he wanted to , and all three of them had never lost a hair off their scalps or been rude to a lady or failed to observe Valentine 's Day . Last year their bill for Valentine 's Day flowers from Robert Homma had been over eighty thousand dollars .

" " Let 's go get drunk , " Rocco said suddenly , when the Pepsi sign blinked on . " Did n't we just get the Cutty Sark account ? " " Last week . . . " Rap Kelly answered . " It was n't easy prying them loose from that old boat . I thought you hated Scotch , Rocco . " " Not if they 're a client . I 'm going to develop a taste . Come , kids , it 's that time of day . " He put on his tie and jacket and led the way , while behind him , Lefkowitz and Kelly exchanged worried glances . Rocco rarely drank . " Just a touch of delicious New York vulgarity just short of actually rough , a hint , merely a hint , of tough chic , " said Leon Ludwig , one of Maxi 's interior decorators . " I do n't agree . We 're talking middle-America ; all Mumsy and English country-cottage , tons of glazed floral chintz , and slightly tatty settees , " replied Milton Bizet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorating team Maxi had used for her last two town houses and the renovation of the Earl of Kirkgordon 's castle in the Border Country . They had not , nevertheless , been able to really impose themselves on the Trump Tower apartment . Their efforts rejected the geometry of the building , since Maxi insisted on keeping favorite pieces bought in her wandering , the spoils of a careless , rich nomad with the instincts of a bazaar keeper . They 'd opened up the walls of the adjoining apartment she acquiredand done what they could , but the job had left them feeling that their client had not been satisfactorily tamed or subdued . " Boys , " Maxi interrupted , " hold it right there . We 're talking office furniture , we 're talking state-of-the-art steno chairs . We are not trying to make a design statement . " The three of them were approaching the area in which the office of Buttons and Bows was located and when Elie stopped the limousine in front of the building off Seventh Avenue , Ludwig and Bizet stood on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leon Ludwig , recoiling . " Here . The lease has three years to run , all the space on the rest of the floor is available , the rent is much lower than in any of the new buildings , and the neighborhood has associations for me , " Maxi said firmly . " It is n't even Art Deco , " Milton Bizet breathed in amazement . He 'd never seen this part of New York before , not even on his way to the theater . " It is n't art anything , " Maxi snapped , " unless it 's Depression Repugnant . It 's a mess and ' it 's utterly inefficient . . . that 's what I want you two to fix up . I need it last week . I ca n't use staff effectively until I have a decent place for them to work . " " Maybe one of those companies that specialize in offices . . . those Itkins or whatever their name is  --  would suit your purposes better than . . . " Leon Ludwig ventured , unwilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building . " Boys , I have no relationship with the Itkins and I assume you want to continue yours with me ? " " Naturally , Maxi , my delicious , but . " 206 207 " Then get your bodies upstairs and stop whimpering , " she said with her most alarming smile . " It 's going to be fun for you , making it all work on a budget , " she added thoughtfully . " And just how much is the budget ? " asked Milton arching his eyebrows . It was n't like Maxi to talk of budget except as something disposable that they would throw guiltlessly to the winds as they went along digging up blissful things without which she could n't live . He 'd known there 'd be trouble , ever since Trump Tower had come into her life . " Half of the rock bottom minimum you can come up with , " she answered . " Funny girl , " Leon purred . " I have this sinking feeling that she 's not joking , " Milton said in unfeignedhorror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their favorite , if marginally difficult , client . " I 'm not . This magazine is going to take a pot of money to produce and I do n't want to see it wasted on the walls of the office . On the other hand , cows give more milk in happy surroundings , as do people , so it 's essential that the whole office be cheerful , gay , fun to work in . I want windows that open , no fluorescent lighting except where it 's absolutely necessary , a smashing reception room  --  do it with mirrors , cheap mirrors , Leon , no bevels ... " " Maxi , have n't you ever heard that you have to spend money to make money ? " Leon said in a last-ditch stand against the all too foreseeable agonies of a strict budget . " Too often . The money will go into salaries . How else can I get the best people away from their present jobs to work on a new magazine ? Well , here we are . " Maxi opened the door of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanished immediately in search of Julie . She did n't like to watch grown men cry . " Welcome back , " Julie said in relief . " I 've got your keys right here , all the old business is wound up , all debts paid , my desk is cleared out , the phone 's still working , and the only thing still hanging around is a blank yellow legal pad and the pencils you left here last week . " " What about my sweater ? " inquired Maxi looking at her strangely . " What sweater ? You did n't leave one here . " " I know . " Eyes like slits , Maxi studied Julie 's new Perry Ellis sweater and skirt costume , the one that would set the standard of adventure for American ready-to-wear that year , two extraordinary ways to use cashmere ; one a dazzling tunic , a tapestry of reds , blues , and yellows , inspired by the Cubist work of Sonia Delaunay ; the other a longish wrapped black skirt that worked absolutely with Julie 's flat black shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had bought one on Saturday , was eight hundred dollars , and it was too eye-poppingly , too specifically and memorablyfall-of-1984 to be worn for more than one season . You could n't even wear it more than once every two weeks in an office . The skirt , at three hundred bucks , could become a classic , but the sweater was a bravura gesture , the sign either of someone so rich that she could afford it without thinking of price , or someone so clothes-mad that she would buy it , wear it a few glorious times , and then keep it forever for her private pleasure . Julie Jacobson could n't be all that rich , Maxi calculated , or she would n't have had to take a job as a secretary while she waited for her minor assistant 's appointment at Redbook . She had undertaken the dreary labor of funeral director of Buttons and Bows with tact , dispatch , energy , and remarkable good spirits , setting up her command post in what had been the old art department . As Maxi had fled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had noticed that the offices were now as spotless as they could be , granted their state of decrepitude . Julie was two girls and a half . " I have a proposal to make to you , " Maxi said , sitting down next to Julie . " No , " Julie answered shuddering . " Really , truly , no . " Maxi ignored her . " How much are you going to be paid at Redbook ? " " A hundred and seventy-five a week , but that 's not the point . " " The point is that you 'll be in the fashion department , as assistant to theassistant to the fashion editor . " " Exactly , " Julie answered , her eyes gleaming with a vision of herself at some time in a far hazy future , sitting in the front row at the New York fashion collections , pencil poised to make notes of whatever she judged worthy . " Have you ever played Monopoly ? " Maxi asked . Julie nodded , still in her dream . " Remember when you got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and collect two hundred dollars from the bank ? Did n't it feel good ? " Julie snapped back to reality . " Maxi , what are you trying to con me into ? I do n't work for you anymore , thank God . As of last Friday I 'm not even on the payroll here . What 's more there is n't a payroll anymore . " " But there is a payroll , a new payroll , and I 'm going to be meeting it every week . " " How many people are you employing ? " Julie asked suspiciously . " So far , none . Eventually dozens and dozens . Hundreds . " " Doing what ? " 208 1 209 " Leon , I meant the color of the paint . We do not have fabric walls at B and B , we do not have fabric anywhere . Fabric is too expensive and gets dirty . The fabric-free office is about to make interior design history , is n't it , Justin ? Zen and the art of office maintenance . It might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might get you the cover of Plastics Weekly . . . it all depends on your imagination and talent . If you show enough of it , I may make the two of you my decorating editors , but first you have to prove yourselves . " " An all-white office , " Milton offered , deeply offended , " with a large box of Ajax and a gross of sponges . " " Can I just bring one white rose in a white bud vase for my desk ? " Julie begged , blushing with excitement . Wholesale ! Justin ! " I 'll supply the rose , " Justin announced . " I 'll lend you an onyx vase , " Leon announced . " White vase indeed . " " Hmm , " sniffed Maxi , " I rather thought I 'd like an all-white office to go with the streak in my hair . We ca n't have two . " " Julie gets it , " Leon decreed , feeling much better . " She 's the only one we have to be nice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But that 's exactly what you were planning to do last week ! Oh really , Maxi ! " " This has nothing to do with last week . You were absolutely right about my idea for Buttons and Bows . It was youthful folly . Since then I 've aged a thousand years in wisdom and experience . " " Is that a fact ? " " Trust me . " " I never trust people who say trust me . ' " " That was a test , " said Maxi smugly . " And you 've passed . Therefore I 'm officially offering you the job of fashion editor of B and B combined with the job of my chief personal assistant in charge of all other details until I find someone who can take them off your hands and leave you totally free to plan the fashion pages . " " All other details ' ? Why do I smell snake oil ? What is B and B ? Anotherremake of Buttons and Bows ? How many fashion pages would there be ? And how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary ? And what if the magazine does n't make it and I blow the job at Redbook ? " " Three hundred a week , to start with , you go wholesale for your clothes , absolute authority within the basic philosophy of B and B , which is simply that women are great the way they are  --  you ca n't argue about that , can you ?  --  and , oh , there you are ! This is Justin , your photographic consultant , Justin , this is Julie Jacobson , the new fashion editor of B and B. You two will be working closely together . " Julie spun around and gaped at Justin who had soundlessly materialized in the doorway and stood leaning against the wall with such compact and tightly coiled power that it looked as if he were holding the building up with his shoulder . He advanced toward Julie , who was hypnotized by the battery of Nikons that he wore as familiarly as if they were a scarf tossed around his neck , took her hand and shook it . " Justin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Julie gasped . " The Justin . I said trust me . That did n't necessarily mean that you could n't , " Maxi laughed . " And here  --  ' hi guys '  --  as Mary Tyler Moore used to say  --  here are Milton Bizet and Leon Ludwig who are designing our offices  --  come in , boys , and greet Julie Jacobson , my fashion editor . She 'll be going over your bills , so be nice to her . Julie , you do n't have to be nice to them at all . In fact , I would advise the utmost caution . Leon , what color office do you see for Julie , assuming that she does n't change her hair ? " " A forest atmosphere , lots of batik , tapa on the walls , obviously a kilim on the floor , fishtail palms . . . " " Pavka , I 'm so glad you asked me to lunch . I have n't seen you in , oh , much too long . " Maxi had rushed into his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her fine limbs that proved forever that the knee is , under some circumstances , far , far from an unlovely joint . " I 've missed you , but I knew you were busy , " Pavka said , careful not to sound reproachful . He was perfectly aware that she had been avoiding him . There were rumors all over Amberville Publications about Maxi 's plan , but no one had a single solid detail to contribute . " We 've been painting the office , " Maxi said demurely . " Well . . . that 's a beginning . " " I think so . " Maxi studied the menu at the Four Seasons Grill Room which had developed into a virtual club of the top executives and agents in publishing , people so important that their perks included the limousines which jammed Fifty-second Street off Park Avenue as if a gangster 's funeralwere going on inside . As well it may have been , in certain subtle senses of the phrase . " And when the offices are painted , " Pavka continued patiently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bring in furniture , put down rugs ? " " We 'll most likely get around to doing something like that , or at least211210drifting in that general direction , " Maxi admitted gravely , giving the questionher most serious consideration . " And , if I understand correctly , eventually you will publish a magazine ? " Pavka pounced , but she did n't flinch . " Ah , that . I imagine so , eventually . Of course , eventually is never tomorrow , but I suppose that sooner or later we 'll putter along and see if we can manage to squeeze out a little . . . a nice little . . . magazine . " " Which does n't , by any chance , have a name yet ? " " Not a name really . No , I do n't think you could say it had a name . " Maxi 's Imperial Jade eyes had suddenly turned as uncompromisingly and flatly green as a color sample . She was determined not to reveal any details to Pavka . She felt like a mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hatching her first egg . " But , my darling , surely you intend it to have a name ? " " In time . In time . " She looked sinfully , blissfully lazy . Time was to be ignored , she seemed to say without words . . . " But Maxi , you do understand the importance of a name ? " " Good Housekeeping , Reader 's Digest , National Geographic , Playboy  --  of course I do . " " I assume you 're looking for a name that tells the reader what the magazine is about , hmm ? " " More or less in that general area , yes . Pavka , did you know that RussellBaker says there are only six subjects : sex , God , marriage , children , politics and baseball ? " " So may I conclude that your magazine is about sex ? " he pressed . " I 'd never ignore it , not completely . Marriage is good too . So is di-vorce . " " Maxi ! Why wo n't you tell me anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bad off-Broadway play . Do n't you know that you have to have an informative title so that you can get people to even glance through the first issue , which is only one of your problems , and at that , only the first of the dozens of problems involved in launching a new magazine . You have to get them to open it , Maxi , much less actually buy it . " " Pavka , angel Pavka , I have the most enormous favor to ask of you . " Maxi tossed him a look of cosmic prettiness . His heart melted . She really did n't have to bother , she had always had his devotion . " Anything you want . You know I 'll help , whatever it is  --  do you want to discuss your plans in detail ? Or can I help you with the dummy ? Nothing is too much trouble for my Maxi . " " All I want you to do is not to tell me about my dozens of problems , " Maxi answered in her sweetest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me , but Pavka , you know too much , you 've seen too many magazines fail . Would you tell a baby who 's about to take her first step about the dangers in downhill skiing ? About hang-gliding ? Ice dancing ? " " Have it your way , my darling , but there is one thing you ca n't stop me from insisting on saying  --  you need to hire someone experienced to handle traffic control , someone usually called an executive editor , or managing editor , someone who wo n't impose his opinion about what goes into the magazine , but who will steer ideas through the many tedious stages from conception to completion , and then get the copy and photos and ads to the printer on time . He should be a pessimist who never believes anything will go right unless he does it himself . A beast of burden , if you will , but a beast you can trust with your life . Otherwise your magazine will be a boat without a rudder . " " I 'm the rudder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and the ocean and certainly the wind that fills the sails , but your temperament is n't that of a rudder . " " Hmm . " Maxi did n't know whether to be irritated or placated but she rather fancied herself as a boat  --  a trim forty-eight-meter , three-masted racing yacht . " I suppose you have someone in mind ? " " There 's a man I can put my hands on . He was managing editor of Wavelength before Cutter 's massacre , and he took a vacation when he was fired so he 's still available . . . a man named Allenby Montgomery . AllenbyWinston Montgomery . " " Do I have to call him General ' ? " " Evidemment  --  by now he does n't answer to any other name . But there 's no need to salute if you do n't want to . " " He sounds like an , easygoing guy , " Maxi gloomed , resignation in her voice . She knew Pavka was right . She needed someone utterly steady around , so she could do all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought about an art director , " Pavka continued cautiously . If Maxi had been at all clear about what she planned to do , she 'd never have been able to keep from unfolding it to him , even if she did n't want his advice . She 'd have been too pleased with herself . Did she even have a concept ? If she did , and he doubted it , whatever it was , it existed on some half-baked drawing board in the back of her little delicious , maddeninghead , somewhere under that cockatoo hairdo which went every which way including up and made her look as if she were actively in bed with a few very close , energetic friends . " An art director ? " Maxi murmured vaguely . " Of course I 've thought about one .. . but that 's as far as I 've got . We 're still waiting for the paint to dry  --  I do n't need an art director yet . " 212 " I asked a great editor once what was the worst single thing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he answered , Steal my art director , ' " Pavka said , almost to himself . " What editor ? " " Your father . I was the art director . " " Evidemment . And touche . But I am thinking about people , from other magazines . It 's a winnowing-down process , a culling , a matter of finding the pearl in the oyster bed  --  I 'm considering it , Pavka , I just have n't made any decisions . Trust me . " " How could I not ? So tell me , how are you coming with the dummy ? " " Brilliantly , just . . . brilliantly . I feel just like the cowboy who jumped into the cactus bush . When they asked him why he 'd done it , he answered , It seemed like a good idea at the time . ' " Laughing , Pavka was able to hide this confirmation of his conviction that Maxi was lying to him . Her summer job at Savoir Vivre had indeed led to major events , marriage and motherhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed anywhere near a dummy , much less become capable of making one . He sighed but he was far from surprised . " Remember , my darling , I 'm here if you need any kind of help , " he said , keeping up the pretense since she wanted it that way . " And I 'll tell the General to call you as soon as he gets back . " " Thank you , Pavka . You 're too good to me . " The two of them finished lunch laughing at the atmosphere of the Four Seasons , that hotbed of sexual possibilities . They observed editors seducing writers , writers seducingeditors , publishers seducing editors and editors seducing publishers , but never saw a writer seducing another writer , for that would be like two professional football linebackers falling in love . In the dignity of the marbleroom half the people present had been married two and a half times to the other half and were working on the third alliance . Their only permanentrelationships were with the headwaiters . After lunch Maxi found Elie right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the doorman to make him move the limousine fartherup the street . As she was driven back to her office , she felt relieved that she had n't been provoked into telling Pavka anything , tempting as it had been . When all was said and done , he was just a little old-fashioned , a bit of a pessimist . He might not have understood that now that she had found her concept the rest of it was all out there , all waiting for her . It merely needed a spot of pinning down . Nothing more . Just a little more .. . thought . .. a touch of ... oh , work .. . yes , face it , work. 213That night , refusing three invitations for dinner , Maxi stayed home . She wished that the men she knew had n't all hooted when she told them that she could n't join them because she had to work . She frowned as she settled herself in the center of her enormous bed , propping herself firmly on the least floppy of her many pillows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the bed so that her knees made a little fur desk . All the materials she thought would be necessary for the fabrication of a dummy lay neatly beside her . She 'd bought ten packages of the thickest paper she could find in a rainbow of vivid colors , five types of Scotch tape , two boxes of special number-three Dutch pencils , a miniature portable pencil sharpener from Sanyo , a vast assortment of ballpoint pens in every color that existed on the market , a complete calligraphy set , and close at hand were the latest issues of all the women 's magazines published in the United States . She looked at the magazines scornfully . She had never seen a complete dummy , only scattered pages of layouts , but obviously it must be a magazine-shaped object . She intended to use the other magazines to clip out ads to put into her dummy so the finished product would n't just be text and pictures . In fact , she decided , hefting the long , expensive , Swissmadescissors , why not clip a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at hand ? Then she could get the magazines out of the way and into the wastepaper basket where they belonged . Soon she had a thick sheaf of ads , most of them in color . After deliberation , Maxi added a few in black and white ; Bill Blass , Blackglama , Lanc6me and Germaine Monteil , just for contrast . She shoved the magazinesoff the bed with a sign of good riddance and , feeling efficient , clipped the ads together in two groups with the paper clips she had not forgotten to buy . Now . Now for the dummy . Perhaps she should just check up first on Angelica , make sure she was doing her homework . No , Angelica 's school did n't begin until next week . She 'd be in the library waiting impatiently for " Hill Street Blues " to begin . Perhaps she should call India and tell her what she was doing . No , they 'd just talk for hours and the evening would disappear . Resolutely she took one of the steel-tipped quill pens from the calligraphy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red paper . The ampersandwas tricky to draw but she did a fairly neat job on her fifth attempt . Eventually she inked boldly , B &B.; At the bottom of the page she made a small circle and carefully inked in the letter C in the middle of the circle . Now she had the copyright on her title ; that was all it took . Extraordinary. 214 215Perhaps it had something to do with the Library of Congress ? Once publishedit would belong to her . Once published . She never believed the person who had told her you ca n't copyright titles . She 'd like to see the person who could take B &B; away from her . Well . So far so good . Now for the text and pictures . Text first , it stood to reason , or how would she know what pictures she needed ? Or if they should be photographs or illustrations ? Yes , text . No , not text ! She was n't going to write the magazine herself , after all . That was what writers were for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How lucky she was that she knew what she did n't want , that she 'd spent so much time eliminatingthe sort of thing that made women envious or depressed or guilty . She 'd already done most of the work , actually , when you came to think about it . Perhaps she 'd join Angelica in the library and see what they were doing up on the Hill this week . Maybe Mick had bought a new suit . Maybe Furillo would fall in love with a blond . Maybe Renko would take up bodybuilding . Maybe Joyce would get a different hairstyle . Maxi sighed deeply . She should have waited till tomorrow to start this dummy . Any day was good for a dummy but only Thursdays brought the Hill . She could just stay to watch the opening shots . No . She would , she had to stay right here . The program was probably a repeat anyway . She reached for the still-empty yellow legal pad that had been malevolently half-hiding under a pillow , picked up a pencil and slowly wrote " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Nancy Kissinger . " Nancy should be glad to get a chance to tell the world , Maxi thought , and breathed deeply for the first time since she 'd arranged herself on the bed . She licked the pencil and reflected deeply . She tugged three times at her white streak and slowly wrote " I Was Wrong About Penis Envy : An Unpublished Manuscript , by Sigmund Freud . " A little long , that title , Maxi decided , but it did jump off the page at you . Her stomach rumbled . She had never realized how hungry it made you to think . Resistingthe urge to go into the kitchen she scribbled " Why You Must Have Lots of Chocolate in Your Daily Diet . " Who was head of the space program ? She would get him to do it . Or Jane Fonda . Which one was the greatest authority figure ? Jane , of course . She slipped off the bed and started to walk in circles in front of the window , not even noticing the lights of Manhattan spread below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to land in Central Park . Suddenly she jumped back on the bed and wrote quickly " The Ultimate Love-Hate Relationship : You and Your Hairdresser , by Boy George . " She skipped a few lines , groaned a few times and then grabbed the pencil again . " RealMen Never Fantasize About Thin Women , by .. . by .. . Clint Eastwood. . . no , Mel Gibson . . . no , Mikhail Baryshnikov . " " Monthly column , " Maxi said out loud . " Monthly column . " She messed about with her hair , scratched her ears , tugged at her toes and finally wrote " Let 's Talk Sex , by Tom Selleck . " She smiled . The same amount of effort that went into thinking up a one-shot article could make a monthly column . It was an economy of effort , she realized , and decided to give it another try to see if it worked . She closed her eyes for a few minutes , poking around in her brain as if it were Santa 's big white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorously , opened them and carefullyinscribed the words " The First Twenty-five Things I Adore About Women Over Thirty , by Warren Beatty . " For another issue it could be women over forty , or fifty or twenty-five , with different writers like RichardGere or Bill Murray or Sam Shepard or Prince or any particularly attractive man . Even if a reader were n't over the age that was under consideration , she could look forward to it or figure that she was prematurely adorable . " The Best Divorce I 've Ever Had , by Liz Taylor . " No column in that one , unless you added a Gabor another month and , no , it did n't have staying power . Most people did n't get divorced that often . Some people never got divorced even once , like the Queen of England for instance . Maxi wrote quickly " Queen : The Worst Job in the World , by Anthony Haden-Guest . " She paused , wondering if her readers would know who Haden-Guest was , and decided that they probably would n't . She crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Prince Philip . " She sneezed vigorously . This was a dusty business . " Where Do They Put the Kleenex Box ? or What Five Famous Women 's Bathrooms Really Look Like When They 've Finished Dressing , a photo essay by Helmut Newton . " With amazement she saw that she 'd come to the bottom of the page . " Sex in a Moving Vehicle , " she scratched on the next page . By John De Lorean . No . By Paul Newman . " Ma ! " The door to her bedroom opened suddenly . " What is it , Angelica ? Ca n't you see I 'm working ? " " Come quick . Lucy 's pregnant . Nobody knows who the father is , or what this will do to her career . Hurry or you 'll miss it ! " " I ca n't stop now . Let me know when you find out . And shut the door after you . " " What happened to your compassion ? " Angelica looked stunned . Was this the same mother whose only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the guys on the Hill ? " They 're just actors , " Maxi replied and wrote " Twenty Good Reasons Not to Have Children " at the top of another page . Alone again , Maxi stretched cautiously . All her equipment was still surrounding her . She had n't made a dent in the dummy yet but she had a strange yet familiar feeling in her stomach . This was . . . making these lists was . . . almost exactly , in fact exactly exactly like . . . having ... FUN ! She popped off her bed in excitement at the realization and went to her bathroom mirror to take a good look at herself . She needed something familiar to calm her down from discovering that this thing that she had been avoiding even thinking about , this thing she had n't told Pavka she was utterly terrified of , this actual writing down of ideas that related to her concept of a magazine that liked its readers , in their natural , imperfect state , was possible after all . She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mascara had smeared where she 'd rubbed her eyes and if she did n't know how pretty she was she 'd have been worried . " The Ten Top Models  --  What They Really Look Like , ' " she said out loud . Justin could get those photos . Steal them . . . because no model would let him take a picture like that on purpose . But if he snapped them quickly before the makeup people and hair people went to work , the girls would never notice when they automatically signed the usual release forms . That would make a good start for the beauty pages for the first issue and make millions of women happy . Beauty pages , she mused . Yes , there would be all those departments filling out B &B,; Beauty and Decorating and Fashion and even Health . Health sounded so institutional . . . why not call it " Living Well : Eating , Drinking and Having Sex " and begin with " The Ten Best Hangover Remedies " ? A true public service , that was what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leon do a piece on " Think Twice Before You Redecorate , " with pages of horrible examples to illustrate the theme , and as for fashion , something soothing . Fashion alwaystended to make everyone so anxious . " The Ten Indispensable Things Every Woman ALREADY Owns , by Yves Saint-Laurent . " With pictures showing how to use them . Maxi tapped her teeth with her pencil as she thought about the pictures . " Ma , Lucy had a miscarriage , " Angelica said sadly , popping her head in through the door . " She must have met a really wrong guy . . . she still wo n't say who he was . " " Wonderful Mr. Wrong Guy , the Essential Not-to-Be-Missed Fun Experiencein Every Woman 's Life , ' " said Maxi . " I do n't get it , " Angelica said . " You will , after Don Johnson explains it to you , " Maxi assured her. aper cuts . Nothing helps papercuts . There is no unguent or pill known to medicine that relieves the tiny but maddeningly painful presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing helps backache except a change of position , exerciseand massage , so , if your work requires you to handle many pieces of paper while maintaining a certain back-straining position , you learned to endure backache and paper cuts . Eyestrain . When things got blurry you went to the bathroom and held a cold , wet washcloth over your eyelids , put in a few eye drops and returned to the task because the only thing that would remove eyestrain was to stop work , and that was n't possible . Not until the dummy was done , because without the dummy B &B; would n't be real . " I suppose , " Maxi said wearily to Angelica who was hovering over her anxiously , " this has built my character . " She pushed the dummy aside , got up from her desk and flopped down flat on the carpet of her bedroom . " You were perfect the way you were , " Angelica retorted . She was so accustomed to feeling slightly superior to her screwball of a mother that this new serious incarnation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other of Maxi 's fads , was a little frightening . It had all started when she 'd canceled that trip to Venice . . . nothing had been the same since . It could n't possibly last more than another week , she thought . True , Maxi had stuck it out in the Border Country of Scotland for almost two years as Countess of Kirkgordon but this was different ; that had been a marriage and this was just a magazine . Angelica shivered , remembering the biting winds of the moors , the drafts at Castle Dread , and then smiled , thinking kindly of her loony second stepfather . Had Ma understood he was nuts ? Nicely nuts ? " When will it be finished , Ma ? " " What do you mean when ' ? Ca n't you tell it 's finished now ? " Maxi asked indignantly . " Why do you suppose I 've stopped working ? Could you218 219please rub my back ? Please , please rub my back . Walk on it in your bare feet , do something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You 're lying on your back . Turn over . " " I ca n't . I do n't have the strength . " " Ma , come on , just roll over . " " I will , in a minute . Angelica , is n't it gorgeous ? Do n't you think my dummy is fabulous ? " Angelica took a look at the object she had grown to loathe . It did n't look any different from the way it had in her mother 's first four attempts at making a dummy . It was hugely fat and bulgy and sloppy and exception- ally uninviting to the eye . Just looking at it , she felt that it would fall apart if she touched it . Obscurely it reminded Angelica of school . She was sure she 'd made something very much like it in third grade , only smaller and a great deal more attractive . " It 's awesome , Ma , really awesome . I like the red cover . That 's a very , nice , bright red , definitely eye-catching . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her daughter . " What 's wrong with it ? " she demanded . " Nothing 's wrong with it , honestly . It 's hot , I mean I do n't know what a dummy is supposed to look like anyway so I do n't have any basis for comparison , but the cover is a great red . . . a humpy red . " Maxi stood up and went over to the desk on which the dummy sat . " It looks like shit , " she said quietly . " A bundle of red shit . And it 's the best I can fucking do . " " Ma ! " " I 'm sorry , Angelica , but I 'm not employing any words you do n't know .. . and use , from time to time . " " It 's not your language , Ma , it 's what you said . You 've worked so hard . It 's got to be good . You could n't be wrong about it  --  you 're just tired . You 're not a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a judge of shit . When you see it you know it . I need help . Specifically I need an art director . Who 's the best art director in the world , Angelica ? " " Why ask silly questions that you know the answer to as well as I do ? " " Who can always get your father on the phone , at any time of day or night ? " " Me , but you would n't want me to ask him to help you ! You 've always said you would n't ask him for a crust of bread if you were dying of hunger or a sip of water if you were dying of thirst . " " I do n't want bread or water . I want the best art director in the world . " " Would you settle for second best .. . please ? " " Angelica , that 's unworthy of you . " " Well then , call him and ask him yourself . The two of you always talk on the phone . What 's the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angelica , and who is going to pick you up , and where and when . We never talk about anything else , not even the weather . " " That 's too dumb for words . " " But that 's the way it is . " " Well . I do n't approve . And I 'm late for my guitar lesson . Adults ! " Angelica said in disgust and disappeared so quickly that when Maxi went running after her , all she saw were the doors of the elevator closing swiftly and soundlessly on the brown and beige carpet of the corridor . Maxi marched back to her room , not bothering even to glance into any of the many rooms of her new apartment , each one so expensively appointedby Bizet and Ludwig , each one filled with the collection of furniture and paintings and sculpture she had tracked down all over the world , hundreds of quickly purchased objects that had seemed necessary to her until the minute she owned them . She had n't used any room of the apartmentexcept her bedroom since she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd had her meals standing up in the kitchen , eating whatever the new cook had seen fit to leave for her in the fridge and returning to work immediately with a quick wave to Angelica if her daughter happened to be home . Her lips tight  --  talk about the ingratitude of children !  --  she dialed the number of Cipriani , Lefkowitz and Kelly . Rocco 's secretary told her that Mr. Cipriani was in a meeting with some gentlemen from General Foods and could n't possibly be disturbed . And after that he was due at Avedon 's studio . A Calvin Klein commercial . " But this is an emergency , Miss Haft , " Maxi explained . She was put through immediately . " What 's happened to Angelica ? " Rocco demanded , in alarm . " She 's fine . Impossible but fine . " " Then . . . why did you call ? " he asked coldly . " Rocco , I need your help . " " Something has happened to Angelica ! Damn it , Maxi . " " Rocco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I have to have your professional assistance on a business matter and I need it fast . When can you come here ? I ca n't bring it to your office . You 'll understand when you see it . " " Maxi , whatever it is you have to have , ' get it from somebody else . " " No. " 220 221 " I 'm in a meeting . Goodbye . " " Rocco  --  if you do n't come to my house and help me I 'm going to . . . to . . . put Angelica on the pill . " " She 's only eleven , for Christ 's sake ! " " Ah , but soon she 'll be twelve and she 's awfully mature  --  you know how precocious she is . Girls are ready for motherhood much earlier these days and with your rampaging Latin blood in her , well , anything might happen . Better safe than sorry . Have you read the latest statistics on teenagepregnancies ? I remember when I was her age . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories . " Tonight at nine . " Rocco hung up without another word . Humming happily , Maxi called her masseuse and made an appointment . Hilda would be over within a half hour . Then a long bath  --  she could wash her hair in the shower and take a nice nap . Why , she wondered , did men make life so difficult for themselves ? If they would only always be pleasant and agreeable and helpful . But no , their characters were such that they simply forced you to employ alternative means of persuasion . It went against her better nature not to be direct , but in an emergency you had to use whatever methods were available . Angelica did n't even like boys . It would be another , oh , at least six years before they had to think about the pill . Or perhaps she 'd want to remain a virgin until she married . Virginity was coming back in . Maxi picked up her yellow pad and wrote absently , " Try Celibacy and See , by Dan Aykroyd and Chevy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rocco said incredulously , staring at the red heap . " You heard me the first time . I want you to fix it and I want it to be the most beautiful fucking dummy ever made on the face of the earth , " Maxi said in a businesslike tone . " I do n't do dummies anymore , Maxi . I believe you 're aware of that fact , " he said , shaking with rage . This rotten bitch needed a good spanking so badly that it made his teeth ache just thinking about it . To think that he had once married a creature so evil , so low , so utterly vile . So selfish , so self-centered , so . . . to say nothing of using outright blackmail . How Angelica managed to be as lovable , as perfect as she was , coming from a mother like this , was a miracle of the supremacy of his own gene pool . No wonder he 'd never even been tempted to marry again . This  --  this disgrace to her gender would turn any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should I do it ? " he asked . " There are dozens of guys I can recommend who can turn that thing into a dummy . There 's no mystery to it . " " Because you 'll do a better job , " Maxi said inexorably . " Better by a few degrees , maybe , but what difference does it make ? What counts is what 's in the magazine , not just the dummy . People are n't fooled by a pretty page , they look for content . " " The content is O.K. I did n't ask you for help on the content , only on the presentation . " " Just like that , hm ? O.K. ? All from your little brain ? Would it interest you to know that Time , Inc. has a super high-powered **25;14825;TOOLONG working on new ideas ? They 've got eighteen top people , includingStolley who founded People and Fier from Rolling Stone plus seventeenfree-lancers and fifteen business types all working like crazy with a budget of over three million a year ? Fifty people , headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best brains Time could buy . They 've already got a finished dummy on something called Women 's Week and another called Investor 's Weekly , plus a number of others with covers and boards ? What do you say to that ? " " It does n't bother me . I do n't believe in committees . Henry Luce probablydid n't believe in committees either , when he was alive . My father did n't believe in committees . Do you have all night to sit around talking shop , Rocco , or do you want to get started on my dummy ? " Maxi said evenly . Her ruffled , artfully messed hair remained firmly on her head and Rocco could n't see her scalp prickling in horror . What if one of Time , Inc. ' s brain trust had come up with her concept ? " I 'm leaving here as soon as I 've talked to Angelica about the pill and what taking it too young can do to her . " " Do n't bother , " Maxi said indignantly . " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never did know when I was joking , that was your problem . One of the many . Anyway tonight is the night Angelica is allowed to watch MTV and she wo n't like to be disturbed . " She went over to the dummy , picked it up and thrust it into Rocco 's arms so quickly that he automatically held on to it . " Shit ! " " I know , that 's why I need you . Sit down , and read it . " " I 'll give you three minutes , you lying bitch . And only because Angelica knows I 'm here and you 'd bad-mouth me if I do n't look at this mess . What the hell is B &B?; That stinks for openers . It 's a brand name of an afterdinnerdrink made by monks , not a magazine name , " Rocco puffed , strugglingwith the floppy mass . He sat down at Maxi 's desk , put the thing on the desktop , and began leafing rapidly through the pages . Maxi held her breath , watching him closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually laid eyes onRocco for over four years . When Angelica was seven she had been quite grown-up enough to be picked up and delivered from Maxi 's apartment to Rocco 's apartment by one or the other of them , or by Elie , without their having to have the slightest contact . Christ , she thought , the mistakes a girl can make because a man is impossibly beautiful . He looks almost exactly as he did when I first saw him and it just simply could n't matter less . . . it 's as if he were invisible . He has as little appeal as a bottle of gin does to someone who 's been in A.A. for twenty years . I wonder when he 'll start losing his hair and getting fat ? It 's inevitable , just a question of time . There must be something fundamentally wrong with him anyway , all those girls he sees , the ones Angelica talks about , and he has n't managed to settle down . Yet he 's thirty-six if he 's a day . He 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . bad for Angelica because old bachelors die young . Why is n't he reacting ? He looked right through the Kissinger article with all those blissfully snooty pictures of Nancy , and did n't even blink , the son of a bitch . He just does n't want to give me the satisfaction . Well , I do n't give a fart about his opinion . . . B &B; is for women , not sellout magazine men who 've lowered themselves to make commercials . I 'm glad he 's suc- cessful , for Angelica 's sake , but obviously the bugger could n't possibly enjoy his life , not with that pinched , set look he 's got on his face . Rocco flipped through the dummy , came to the end and slapped his hand down on it , closing it firmly , and pushing it away . " How much is this going to sell for ? " " Rocco ! You mean it has a chance ? Oh , Rocco ! You 'd never have asked me that if you did n't think it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieved than she could have believed possible . " It has a certain . . . quality . I do n't mean it has quality , ' God knows , I mean there 's something catchy about it . . . a reflection of your twisted mind . It might sell a few copies . " " I want it to sell for a dollar fifty . " " You 're raving . Much too cheap . " " That 's what People costs , and everyone buys it . " " Maxi , I really do n't like to break this news to you but you 're talking about one of the biggest-circulation books in the country and it sits at the supermarket checkout counters at point-of-sale where women just auto- matically put it into their shopping carts . " " That 's where B &B; will be , " Maxi said calmly . " It 's meant for the same audience , plus the Cosmo audience and the Good House audience . Women , Rocco , women . There are a lot of women in this country who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , a magazine that they can have fun with , a magazine that guarantees a good time . " pages 223-226 missing18ut . And . . . print ! " The director'svaledictory tone marked the final second , the final take of India West 's latest picture . She almost ran to her dressing room , radiant with liberty and the unprecedentedfact that her shrink , Dr. Florence Florsheim , was on vacation at the same time as the picture wrapped . This conjunction of events had n't happened in the years since she 'd become a star . She was at liberty to rush to the aid of Maxi whose last phone call had been so disturbing . There must be something seriously wrong . Maxi had n't called in two weeks and since that Sunday , whenever India tried to telephone her the only person she could reach was Angelica who had developed an interesting talent of lying convincingly . " Ma 's working and absolutely ca n't be disturbed , " she 'd said each time , and if India did n't have a profound knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , it was probably hereditary , that talent for lying . Angelica was as believable as Maxi herself . But whatever sinister mystery was going on " back East " as she found herself saying , in the same way the English stuck for life in some Indian garrison town used to say " home " when they meant Britain , India intended to find out about it at first hand . Tomorrow she was flying to New York , her bags were packed , the beastly dogs were in a kennel that charged only a little less than the Beverly Hills Hotel , and by evening she 'd know what was up with her oldest and her only best friend . Maxi could n't have been serious about that absurd plan she had to publish a magazine about . . . zippers ? Her story had been hard to follow , interrupted as it had been by bouts of self-recrimination and violent outbursts against her wretched uncle . Except for Lily , who was so often photographed , it was hard to visualize Maxi 's family , India thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few brief times all those years ago when she and Maxi were both teenagers doing their homework together . After Maxi 's first marriage , her contact with the Amberville family had been maintained purely through what her friend told her . If Maxi hadn'tvisited from time to time during these last six years in California they would scarcely have laid eyes on each other since Maxi 's first divorce , when India was in the process of leaving Manhattan for her freshman year at college . She had managed to catch up with Maxi and to spend a few days on board the yacht when her friend had decided to take on heavenly Bad Dennis Brady , in Monte Carlo , but she 'd missed the miserable Scottishyears entirely . A shame about that ; the Countess of Kirkgordon must have been a priceless , not-to-be-forgotten piece of miscasting . Now Maxi was her family , India reflected . Her own parents were dead , but Maxi had remained the one fixed point in her life . Even though ninetyninepercent of their contact was by phone , they could read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , she was Angelica 's godmother , and made up for her lack of physical attendance by sending her marvelous presents . You would n't think a nice little girl would lie like that to her own darling , lovable , gift-sending godmother , would you ? She 'd have to have a long talk with the youngster about Emerson and the importance of the truth . With Maxi for a mother there was no way of knowing what bad habits she might have fallen into , India told herself with a dubious shake of her head . She 'd straighten the kid out . Give her the benefit of some of Doctor Florsheim 's insights , buy her some decent sheets . Maxi was having a Rolodex housewarming . Everyone listed in her Rolodex had been invited , and had accepted . Working through one morning with Julie , neither of them off the phone for a minute , out of sheer joie de vivre at the thought of her precious dummy being transformed by Rocco , she had put the party together in the way she liked best . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the same night , " she said to Julie . " If you give people time to plan what they 're going to wear and get their hair done and wonder who else will be there , you take the bloom off the rose . And if they 've made other plans , they can always bring their friends with them . It 's like a marvelous surprise package . " It was a zoo , a very choice zoo for only the best species . Gazelles , peacocks , antlered stags , superb panthers , sleek seals , self-satisfied lions and , here and there , a delicate monkey . Manhattan animals all , the decibel level of their voices reaching a pitch that no group in any major city of the world could , or would desire , to produce . The front door was left wide open because the doorbell could not be heard inside . India , followed by the elevator man carrying her luggage , paused on the threshold , bewildered . She started to turn around and leave . Obviously this was no time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suite thestudio kept at the Palace and call tomorrow . Parties made her more horriblyshy than usual . " Godmother ! " Angelica , as reverently as possible , lifted her six inches off the floor and looked at her , stunned . " It 's you ! You yourself , in person . Totally awesome ! Ma tried to call but you were n't home . How did you know about the party ? " " You . . . are . . . Angelica ? " " I know , I 've grown . I 'll put you down . I did n't hurt you , did I ? " " Of course not . You just  --  surprised -- me . Now , listen here , Angelica , you told me your mother could n't be disturbed because she was working and I walk in on a madhouse . What 's going on ? " " She was working , Godmother , until last night . Macabre ! Now she 's relaxing . " " And why do you have three holes punched in each of your ears , Angelica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Have you joined a religious cult ? " India asked as severely as possible in the face of the consternation Angelica 's unexpected beauty caused . Had she any idea of what she would become ? " I went for it , Godmother , " Angelica explained . " Do you think it was a mistake ? I feel like a freakazoid , to tell you the truth . But do you like my to-die-for denims ? Hot , huh ? I think they were made in a leper colony somewhere . Macabre ! " " I can relate to them , " India said carefully , reaching as far back as she could into the seventies for a suitable response . " The holes in your ears will grow back together if you take the studs out and could you please stop calling me Godmother ? " " If you insist , " Angelica agreed , a little crestfallen . " I 'll take your bags to the guest bedroom . . . India . " Angelica lifted them easily and began to lead the way into the apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay here . It 's jammed , " India said , ready to flee . " The bottom line , India , is that I will clear the guest room out for you in five seconds . You 're the guest of honor . Could you be totally into that ? " " Do you always talk this way , Angelica ? " " I try . I try , " Angelica said , picking up India 's luggage and clearing a pathway for her . That child needs help , India thought , as she quickly changed her clothes in the locked guest room . It was lucky she had come . It might not be too late . Obviously Maxi had neglected her education . India wafted out of the room , wearing a dress of white lace and white chiffon from Judyth van Amringe that floated so lightly that it seemed to be held together only byher brooch , an antique Greek coin set in cabochon sapphires and emeralds , which she 'd pinned just above one hipbone . Her beauty was a creature of seasons , lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she flowed from the embodiment of bewitching spring to full summer to ripe autumn , depending on the demands of the director or the script . Today , left to her own decision , she was springtime in all its promise , all its freshness . Shy as she was , India was realistic . There was no way to find clothes that would make her disappear at parties so she might just as well look like a star . People expected it and essentially it aroused less attention than did the tatty , ratty , **32;14852;TOOLONG you , Diane Keaton look that just made people curious and hostile . Nor , in a year in which clothes glittered , would she give in to it , because anything that sparkled made her feel like an Oscar presenter and she was , after all , an Oscar winner . India went in search of Maxi , moving with a deliberate drift , a technique she 'd perfected for parties , designed to keep her in motion at all times . If stopped , she still suggested constant movement by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She never carried a glass so that if she found herself stuck in conversation she could say , " Oh , I must find a drink , I 'll be right back , " and disengage herself . Or she could ask the man she was talking to  --  women never seemed to want to say anything to her  --  to be an angel and get her a drink and then escape in another direction . If India actually wanted a drink she went to the bar , got it from the bar- tender , drank it straight down and gave the glass back immediately . India always looked into the air above people so that they could n't catch her eye , zigzagged slightly as she drifted , so that she presented a moving target , and wore an expression that instantly conveyed that she was intent on joining someone she knew terribly well on the other side of the room . This combination enabled her to attend the necessary Hollywood partie without actually having to speak to anyone except the agents from Cre- ative Artists who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a lot . As a client , she did n't intimidate them , for how could the be intimidated by any woman , no matter how fabled a beauty , when tha beauty was theirs to sell and her income was automatically reduced b their commission ? Actually , India thought , as she drifted , hoping that she was insulated b her mannerisms , she never felt shy with her agents or the men who wer physically involved in the making of movies . They knew she was just , another girl , once they 'd graduated from apprenticeship and reached the ' stage of second assistant to a second assistant to someone or other . Doctor , Florence Florsheim said that there was no difference between being an elusive motion-picture star and a plain , everyday wallflower , India thought , fighting the beginning of panic . " What was the worst thing that could happen if you did get involved in a conversation ? " Dr. Florsheim always wanted to know . India could n't explain to her own satisfaction . Her mind blanked out at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the way she looked stopped conversation dead , leaving the burden of human exchange on her incurablyreluctant shoulders . The best thing about Dr. Florsheim was that she never looked at India , except when she came in and when she left the office , and she never permitted small talk . Maintaining her seemingly purposeful course , but picking up speed , Indiawent from room to room , panic mounting as Maxi did n't appear . Soon she 'd have to start looking at people instead of above them , and that meant the risk of catching someone 's eye . " I 'm sorry ! " She had bumped directly into a man , causing him to spill the two glasses he was holding all over his suit . " My God , I 'm clumsy , I was n't looking , let me help mop up , oh dear , " she babbled , blushing with confusion . " It 's just vodka , do n't worry . No harm done , " he reassured her , and there was something in the resonance of his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterly dissolved her panic . He would probably be in control of the situation if he 'd spilled the drinks on her , she thought , amazed at his ability to calm her down . Only a few film directors had ever been able to do that with so few words , and they had been the great ones . " You seem to be looking for somebody , " he remarked . " Can I help ? " " No , " India heard herself answering . " I was just wandering around . " Maxi could wait , she decided , daring to actually look at the man she 'd just drenched . He was almost a head taller than she was , probably in his early thirties , and as he stood there calmly , ignoring his wet jacket , she found herself wondering what he 'd look like if he were in love . A passing waiter took away the two glasses he was still holding . She grabbed a handful of cocktail napkins . " Could n't I just . . . you 're dripping on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion . He took the napkins out of her hand and held them . " Vodka evaporates and does n't leave a stain . There 's enough body heat in this room to make it disappear in a minute . " The words were simple enough but there was a meditative expression on his face , as if , somehow , he were dreaming and as if the dream were one of gallantry . So fascinated that she forgot her habitual fear of anyone unknown , India found herself looking at him as particularly inquisitive and tactless people sometimes looked at her , as if they could learn something just from the way her features connected with each other . There 's a courtliness to him , she thought , something to do with being kind and firm and confident , some- thing about his mouth , formed for . . . no , by bravery . And an impa- tience at the same time . There was a kind of impact of . . . was it concen- tration ? He was , somehow , electrokinetic . She hoped he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drinks , but he seemed disinclined to move . They stood together in the middle of the restlessly busy room , an island of two tall , isolated people She peered into his eyes and it seemed to her that he was looking at her urgently , with intensity , yet with no sign of recognition , of the deference or bedazzlement she was resigned to seeing . " I like your voice , " he said . " Thank you . " For the first time in her life she did n't feel that she had to apologize for a compliment . His confidence seemed to be contagious . " It makes love to the air , " he added . " Well , you know that there 's always the chance that perhaps it 's just a trick , " she answered , using , in a sudden , unexpected rush of her old sense of mischief , the accent she had learned to play Blanche DuBois , slurring her pronouns with a kind of breathless , giddy emphasis on the verbs , ending the sentence with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He smiled as if she were deliciously , childishly silly , and India felt ridic- ulously proud of herself . " A plantation voice , " he said , " I 've always liked a girl with a plantation voice , but it 's not precisely suitable to you . You 're too timid to be Southern .. . that 's their charm . . . they never let their shyness show so they do n't arouse it in others . " " And mine shows ? " she asked , downcast . She 'd always believed that she had n't been really good as Blanche , even if everybody said she had been . " Instantly . To me , anyway . But I like that too . To be timid at times is universal to the human race , but in this city people become aggressive just so that their natural , normal , inevitable shyness wo n't be revealed . The result "  --  he gestured  --  " is what you hear . It 's tiring to listen to , and hard to combat . Half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more easily under the noise than above it . " " I had a coach once who told me that . " " A coach ? " He bent toward her and peered at her even more closely . " A . . . vocal coach , " she said , bewildered . " Are you a singer ? " " I 've been known to sing , " India answered , utterly astonished . It had been so many years since she had met someone who did n't know who she was that she hardly knew how to treat this fact . Her eyes sharpened with sudden suspicion . Oh Lord , let him not be one of those people who pretended not to recognize her . They were worse than gawkers . No , whatever he was he simply was n't a moviegoer or a magazine reader . In his householdshe obviously was n't a household word . " What else do you do ? " he asked , giving her no time to ask about him . He had a habit of command , she realized as she replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , well , you know , live , like everybody else . I feed my dogs and go to exercise class and read a lot and swim and , well , go to a few parties , and that 's about it . I guess that does n't sound like a very full life . . . oh , and I go to my shrink , of course , Doctor Florence Florsheim . . . stop laughing ! I do n't see what 's so funny about that , it 's a name like any other , she ca n't help it though . . . with Florence for a first name perhaps she should n't have . . . married Mr. Florsheim . " India was reduced to a puddle of giggles . " She must have been madly in love , or maybe it 's her maiden name . " " Did you ever ask her ? " he wanted to know . " She rarely answers questions . She 's very orthodox about that anyway . " " My shrink answers questions . " " Then he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . " He told me that , like every other shrink , he stood on Freud 's shoulders , but he 'd thrown away the stuff he did n't believe in . . . if you say you hate your mother he assumes that your old lady was a tough number , until proven otherwise , not that you wanted to make love to her when you were three . " " I like the sound of that . But I 'm stuck with Doctor Florsheim . . . she knows too much , " India said darkly . " Other people 's shrinks always sound better than your own . It 's the first rule of analysis . However , I agree about your life , it does n't seem exactly full . What about a husband and children ? " " Nonexistent . And you ? " " Never married , no kids . " " Are n't you interested or have n't you had the time ? " India inquired cautiously . There had to be something wrong . There always was . " It 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm available , shamelessly available , and I 'd like to get out of this hellhole and take you to dinner . Shall we go ? " " Oh , yes , " India replied . " India ! What are you doing here ? " Maxi asked , so surprised that she squeaked . " Hello , darling . I 'll tell you later . I have to go out to dinner now , " India234said ruthlessly , trying in one glance to convey love , support , and the absolutenecessity of Maxi 's letting her escape the party with this man , this heavenly , heavenly man , before another second passed and someone  --  perhaps the person he 'd been getting the drinks for  --  appeared and tried to get him away from her , because she would not , could not run that risk . " But Toby , you just ca n't disappear with India like that , " Maxi wailed , outraged . " She is my friend , damn it , not yours , and nobody ever even told me she was here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wonder that held both shock and the beginning of choice . " India ? That friend ? The one who 's the most beautiful girl in the world ? " Toby stopped dead , a complex set of emotions appearing on his face , hesitation first among them . " Oh , shut up ! " India said , timid no longer . " You said you liked me four times . So do n't act like a . . . dumbbell . Anyway , it 's too late now , is n't it ? " " My , my , " Maxi cooed , " I think the two of you are going to have your first fight . Oh , good ! Can I listen ? " 19utter Amberville seemed intent on retracing hid exact path , as if he were putting his feet into footprints1 he 'd made on a wet and sandy beach , as he walked back and forth on the carpet that lay in front of the window behind his desk . His hands wereN clasped tightly together behind his back , his knuckles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much redder than his fingers . Maxi watched him as he walked , perched on the arm of the chair she had chosen , refusing the low chair he had offered . Instead , taking her time , she had picked out a chair with a reasonably wide arm , and pulled it to preciselythe spot she intended to be in , at a distance too far away from his desk for his comfort . She swung her legs , clad in high shining riding boots and brown velvet jodhpurs laced from boot-top to knee . She caressed the frilled neck of the Victorian lace blouse she wore under a brown velvet , shawl-collared jacket , nipped in at the waist , a Chantal Thomass fantasy that was never meant to come near the saddle of a horse . " Cutter , " she said , breaking his fuming silence , " my driver is doubleparkeddownstairs . Would you disgorge whatever you seemed so anxious to see me about , so that he does n't get a ticket ? " Cutter turned and finally stopped his pacing , leaning with both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can see that I underestimated you , Maxi , " he said . " Could n't you have told me that on the phone ? I 'm a busy woman , and this trip downtown has fouled up my morning . Time is money , Cutter , time is money ! " Weeks had passed since Rocco had finished the miraculous dummy , dozens of expensive people were on Maxi 's payroll , the work of completing the first issue and laying out those to follow was going on at top speed , all propelled by Maxi 's flood of energy , working seven days out of seven . Not only was the door to her office always open , the room did not , by her instructions , even have a door , nor did Maxi have a desk . There was a big table in the middle of her office covered with cases of cold soft drinks236 237and urns of coffee , tea and Sanka which were always kept full by the cateress Maxi had hired for that task ; a woman who kept platters piled with cookies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were constantly replenished . A number of high , round tables surroundedthe feast , with bar stools invitingly placed about them . The tables could easily be pushed together when the group around them grew larger . Her office was as close to the kind of eighteenth-century coffeehouse in which Samuel Johnson would have felt at home as Maxi could devise , and the result was the one she had planned for : everyone on her brilliant , young , constantly growing , highlypaid staff wandered in at least once or twice a day , knowing that they were permanently welcome and would be royally fed . They tended to hang around and talk about B &B,; people from all departments getting to know each other ; and from this constant rubbingtogether of the best talent in the magazine business , from these excited " why the hell not ? " conversations , came a steady stream of new ideas for the magazine , not one of which was ever lost , for Maxi noted them all down , unobtrusively perched on one or another of the stools . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of her rotating staff of three secretaries replaced her . The only reason that Maxi had agreed to come down to Cutter 's office was that she would n't let him see her own . He 'd contaminate it . " I never would have believed you had it in you , " Cutter continued . " No , not even you . " " But you have n't even seen the first layouts , " Maxi answered , annoyed . Could someone have leaked him pages ? Did he have a spy planted on her staff ' ? " I 'm not talking about your magazine , Maxi , whatever it may be . " Cutterlooked her full in the face and she realized that he was flushed , almost crimson , with suppressed rage . He pushed a pile of paper across the desk to her . " These are what I 'm talking about , these ! Bills for millions of dollars , bills that those damn fool accountants have been paying automatically , because they were signed for by an Amberville , paying without asking me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent , for furnishings , for salaries , for photos , for articles , for expenses , for . . . " " Food , " Maxi interrupted . " Start-up money is always more than you expect , " Maxi added with composure . " It wo n't be as expensive once B &B; is actually out and , naturally , as soon as we start making money the whole picture will change . " " No , do n't play that game with me , Maxi . I know , and you know that I know , what we agreed on . Buttons and Bows ! That was the magazine youwanted and that was the one you got . A trimming magazine with almost no budget at all . This thing , this B &B,; whatever it is , has absolutely nothing to do with the deal we made . " " Not so , " Maxi said coolly . " It 's as much Buttons and Bows as Buttons and Bows was Trimming Trades Monthly . It even says so on the masthead . You never said I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter a word about not changing it into something more viable . You gave me a year and I 'm taking my year , and that year has barely begun . " " I never gave you the right to spend millions , " Cutter said violently , hitting the desk with his fists . " I hope that desk is n't valuable , " Maxi commented with a tiny yawn . " It looks authentic , but then they make such good copies these days . " " Millions of dollars . . . I never said . . . " " Ah , but you did n't say I could n't , did you , Cutter ? " Maxi smiled lazily at him , and readjusted the lace at her neck , preening , and then flicked a spot of dust off one of her boots . Her eyebrows rose in amusement until they were hidden by her bangs . " It 's too late now , you see . I 've already  --  and in person  --  sold six months of advertising , at very special introductory rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertise in the other Amberville publications , and , naturally , they have every reason to believe that when an Amberville comes to them with a splendid concept for a new magazine and an absolutely smashing dummy , they 're spending their money safely . Amberville Publications is committed to B &B,; Cutter , totallycommitted as far as the advertising and business community is concerned . As long as the magazine is being published we have to run those ads , or else give them their money back and look , at the very least , frivolous , unbusinesslike . Especially since you just took it upon yourself to fold three other books . They all know that B &B; has your special blessing , Cutter . I 've made sure they realized that . You ca n't touch my magazine without making everyone suspect that the entire company is about to go under . " " Do you have any idea what the money you spent is going to do to our balance sheet ? " he demanded . " Punch a giant hole in it , I imagine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving toward the door , " about those bills , it 's only fair to tell you , becauseyour blood pressure looks dangerously high to me , the bills on your desk are only the beginning . I 've gone way out on a big , long , lovely limb for the first six months  --  you have to spend money to make it , and I ca n't risk disappointing my readers . First catch them , then keep them , ' as my father used to say . " Maxi reached the door and held it open while Cutter sat immobilized by sheer rage behind his desk . " Another thing , I 've takena series of ads in all the major magazines and newspapers that are read by media people , telling them about B &B; and our plans for the future , an introduction to the newest Amberville Publication as it were . You should be getting those bills very soon . Do n't bother to get up  --  I 'll see myself out . .. as usual . " She went through the door and half-closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance at him , looked closer , shook her head and made a little tut-tut sound of concern . " Goodness gracious , Cutter , you do look upset . " She shut the door softly but not until she 'd asked , " Was it something I said ? " " Lily , love , come and sit closer to me , " Cutter said , patting the space at his side on the couch . Obediently , Lily left her chair and took the offered place , her pliant , slender body curving into his side . She sighed in a satisfaction almost deeper than love . These moments together , when he came home from his office , these long-awaited moments were , she often reflected , the reward for her years of patience . Even more of a reward than physical passion , although the endurance of that unquenchable , living connection of their two bodies was her great pride . The years that had separated them had left the embers of a fire that needed only a breath of wind , another match , a twist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it flame into hot life . But to be able to sit together at the end of a day and talk quietly , as she had never totally enjoyed doing with Zachary ... ah , that was the even more delicious joy . It was at moments like this , when the easy comfort of their long-sought , so-long-delayed intimacy , was combined with the new happiness of being married to Cutter , that she knew that she finally had what she had always wanted , had always deserved . " Darling , something happened today at the office that suddenly made me think about you , about the future of our life together , " Cutter said . Alarmed at the gravity of his tone , Lily lifted her head from his shoulder abruptly . " No , no , " he laughed , " nothing to worry about . Something to dream about , something that I would never have initiated on my own , but still , a piece of business I ca n't not tell you about . " " Business ? " Lily asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking business . I 've never understood it and when Zachary used to drone on and on , I 'd get a headache just from having to sit and listen . " " It is business , and yet , in a way , it is n't . Not boring business . You have to listen , darling . " " All business is boring , " Lily said willfully , " but I 'm the patient sort , as you should know . " " I had an extraordinary phone call today from a man at the United Broadcasting Company , a perfect stranger to me . He wanted to know if there was any possibility of your meeting with him to discuss . . . to talk about an eventual sale of Amberville Publications . " " What ! But he 's mad ! Who on earth does he think he is ? What utter nerve . What makes him think the company 's for sale ? I just ca n't imagine anyone rude enough to make a call like that out of the blue , " Lily said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been stolen while she looked on helplessly . Cutter laughed indulgently . " That man from UBC 's not trying to take advantage of you , my darling . He 's just doing his job . It 's not some sort of attack . In fact , it 's an enormous compliment . All I have to do is to call him tomorrow and say you 're not interested , that Amberville Publications is n't for sale . And he 'll go away , or maybe he wo n't . But one way or another you can expect to get more and more calls like that . " " Because Zachary 's dead ? " " Even if Zachary were alive , it would n't make any difference . He 'd be getting the same queries . It 's the trend of the times . Lots of companies , particularly major conglomerates , are all out looking for magazines to buy . " " Well , I 'm not interested . Why should I be ? Anyway , I only own seventypercent of the stock . You know the children have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their stock except to you and you 're the majority stockholder . You can do absolutely anything you want , Lily . They ca n't stop you . When I explained why we had to stop publication of those magazines that were losing money , I thought you understood . " " I did . You convinced me that it was necessary . But selling . . . I never thought of selling . Zachary spent his whole life building the magazines . .. he never sold one . I do n't know if he ever would have , under any circumstances , for any amount of money . " " Oh , Lily , you ca n't stop being loyal , can you ? Have you ever thought of the many ways you were sacrificed to those magazines ? You , Lily ? All that business talk that bored you so , all those business trips when you were left alone , all the times you had to cope with the children and their problemsby yourself because Zachary was working , the endless weekends he spent shut up in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who did n't interest you ? Those magazines were built on your life , Lily . Years and years of the only life you 'll ever have . And now you 're still thinking about what Zachary would do with them if he were still alive.
