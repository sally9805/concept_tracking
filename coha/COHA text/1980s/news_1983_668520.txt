For Victor Weisskopf , one of the world ' s most eminent physicists , time spent on science is a stolen pleasure - at least half his time is spent trying to raise public awareness of the dangers of nuclear weapons , weapons he helped to create . Weisskopf , 74 , now a professor emeritus at MIT , was one of the first to call attention to how the new weapons had changed the rules of international politics . His efforts have continued since 1945 , perhaps culminating this April in a bittersweet address to a reunion " celebration " of scientists who had worked to develop the bomb at Los Alamos , New Mexico during World War II . Those were " the most exciting years of our lives , " Weisskopf told the audience , but he continued , " Our achievement has been the unintended cause of the world ' s tragic predicament . Therefore , we physicists have a special duty . " A European-trained scientist who knew Einstein and worked with Oppenheimer , Weisskopf is one of several researchers who worked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to hate it . He has concluded that scientists are bound to their inventions as parents are to children . Weisskopf , tall and angular , slumps deep in his chair when he talks about American and Soviet strategies in the arms race . When the talk shifts to science or music or literature , he brightens visibly , unfolding from his chair and navigating a path across the crowded study of his Cambridge home , gesturing , rummaging through teetering stacks of books and magazines , hunting for pen and paper . The room , part attic , part study , embodies the Viennese-born scientist ' s wide range of interests . Small stained-glass designs hang in the window ; there are tapestries along one wall . A corner of a coffee table is visible under copies of Foreign Affairs , a paperback on Descartes , a collection of essays by Einstein , The Original Blue Danube Cookbook , a book on physics , back issues of The New York Review of Books . Dostoevsky and Einstein are neighbors on a wall of bookshelves . " Political questions take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and I ' m always going back to physics as a relaxation . " A few minutes later , he adds , " When life is very bad , two things make life worth living - Mozart and quantum mechanics . " From the beginning , he has viewed theoretical science as " the greatest cultural achievement of our time , " an intellectual cathedral that can be a sanctuary for the best impulses of humanity . Weisskopf comes out of the golden age of physics when European scientists in the 1920s and 30s created a new picture of how the world behaves at the atomic level . " We touched the nerve of the universe , " he says . " It was a great revolution that allowed us for the first time in the history of science to get at the root of the matter - why are leaves green , why are metals hard , why are mountains so high and not higher - all those natural questions of our immediate environment got an answer . " Weisskopf made major contributions to that work , say those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles beneath it . " Viki ( as he is known to his friends is a past master at taking subtle and mathematical and opaque material , and by careful thought reformulating it into a simple , clear problem , " says Philip Morrison , an MIT colleague of Weisskopf ' s . Today , Weisskopf says the decision to build the atomic bomb was justified by the urgency of the moment - Hitler was believed to be racing for that ultimate weapon . But since the war , Weisskopf adds , physicists have had a responsibility to try to bring their " brain child " under control . Weisskopf came to that position early and ardently , helping to found the Federation of Atomic Scientists at war ' s end to lobby for international arms control . He acknowledged in an interview , though , that " we scientists worked for 40 years to get the public interested , and we really did not succeed . " But within the last two or three years , he believes , religious leaders and other non- scientists have begun to tap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason that scientists opposed to the arms race have had only limited impact on the public , Weisskopf feels , is that today there are fewer inspirational , charismatic scientific figures than there once were . Such leaders are important not only for the discoveries they make , but also for the sense of meaning that their work and their lives can convey , Weisskopf believes . " The Gothic cathedrals in the old days , " he says , " had a very important irrational purpose , not at all practical - they gave people a feeling that their lives are great and important . " Lots of artists and sculptors made statues that you can never see , unless you go way up there . And the details of modern physics will only be impressive to a few ( who have technical training in science* . But the field itself is a cathedral . " The metaphor is not chosen lightly . " For him , science has a religious dimension , in the sense that it is something to unite the intellectual community , and , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silvan Schweber , a physicist and historian of science at Brandeis University . " He is perhaps the leading example , almost the embodiment , of the statement that physics is an international activity , a cooperative activity , " Schweber says . That talent for inspiring cooperation among rivals was displayed most dramatically between 1961 and 1965 , when Weisskopf served as director of the European Center for Nuclear Research , known by its French acronym as CERN . That 12-nation facility is today considered the best in the world for research in high energy physics , to some extent because of Weisskopf ' s early influence . Just last month , experimenters at CERN made a discovery that provided final confirmation of a theory for which a Nobel Prize had already been awarded . " Before , France , Germany , Italy couldn ' t get together , and now CERN is better than anything in America or Russia or Japan , " says Morrison , the MIT physicist . Weisskopf is proud of his scientific accomplishments , but he takes pains to emphasize that the scientific approach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one way of thinking becomes too dominant , one gets in trouble , " he says . " In the Middle Ages , religion was as dominant as science and technology are today . As a corollary , you got the Crusades . Today science and technology suppress all other ways of thinking , and it gives rise to the arms race . What we need is the knowledge that there are different ways to knowledge of the human predicament . But the human mind always wants one way . " " What a Beethoven sonata tells us about the world can not be expressed scientifically , " he says indignantly . " The scientist can describe how it works in the brain or the vibrations in the air , but that ' s ridiculous , completely irrelevant , when you ' re talking about Beethoven . The sonata has a deep meaning which can not be expressed . It has significance , it enriches your life , and gives you insight into your deepest self . " Weisskopf left Europe a century after the time of Mozart and Beethoven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titans in physics of almost equal stature . He played chamber music with Einstein and worked with most of those who created the new field called quantum mechanics . That new theory replaced the perfectly predictable , clockwork universe of Isaac Newton with a mysterious world where events could only be described in probabilities . The idea that in the realm of the atom exact prediction is impossible won the day , but it did not win over every physicist . To the end of his long life , Einstein persisted in his belief that quantum mechanics was destined to be superseded by a theory that reinstated exact predictions - " God does not play dice , " he continually asserted . Einstein ' s great friend and rival in this intellectual sparring match on how the universe fits together was the Danish physicist Niels Bohr , and Bohr was Weisskopf ' s mentor . Weisskopf went to Copenhagen to work under Bohr in 1932 , collaborating firsthand with the founder of quantum mechanics , and , not so incidentally , meeting his future wife , a ballet dancer named Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bohr a joint ranking atop the pyramid of twentieth-century physicists . And Weisskopf also worked with Wolfgang Pauli , Werner Heisenberg , Erwin Schrodinger , Paul Dirac - Nobel Prizewinners all , and a constellation of scientific talents perhaps comparable to Van Gogh , Gauguin , and Monet among modern artists . In 1937 , after he had been arrested and released by the Nazis , Weisskopf fled Europe . Already a prominent scientist , he took a job as an instructor at the University of Rochester for $200 a month . In 1943 he was called to Los Alamos ( and , as a new American citizen , promptly elected chairman of the town council ) . He worked with the other theoretical physicists racing Hitler to develop the bomb , and at war ' s end was hired by MIT . Looking back , Weisskopf calls it a " charmedlife . " He notes , " My family life was always extremely happy , my children are extremely successful ( Karen works in the Boston school system , Thomas is a professor of economics at the University of Michigan* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says , is the nuclear bomb , " a shadow over my life . " Weisskopf walks to the window . " There is such fantastic beauty , in landscape , poetry , painting , " he says , then shakes his head , and adds slowly , " And now these are all threatened .
