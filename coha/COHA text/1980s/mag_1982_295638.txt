Andropov talks of change , but moves slowly <P> Sessions of the Supreme Soviet rarely attract much notice outside the Soviet Union , where the legislative body is dismissed as a rubber-stamp parliament . However , last week 's gathering in the vaulted , neoclassical chamber of the Great Kremlin Palace was different . As the 1,500 Deputies filed in to take their seats , diplomats and journalists who crammed the visitors ' gallery animatedly discussed only one topic : Would there be a selection of the next President of the Soviet Union ? Since Leonid Brezhnev 's death on Nov. 10 , the ceremonial and highly visible post has been vacant . Kremlin watchers now wondered if Yuri Andropov , the former KGB chief who had so swiftly succeeded Brezhnev as General Secretary of the Communist Party , would also aspire to a second title as head of the Soviet state . <P> After the Deputies had paused for a minute of silence in memory of Brezhnev , Moscow Party Boss Viktor Grishin made his way to the podium . " Comrade Deputies , " he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ... proposes the election of General Secretary Comrade Yuri Vladimirovich Andropov to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet . " The Deputies burst into perfunctory applause . Onlookers in the gallery turned to each other to make sure they had heard the word " Presidium " rather than " presidency . " They had . Andropov had been nominated for the 40-member ruling Presidium of the Supreme Soviet , but not as its President . Then , as if a switch had been thrown , all 1,500 delegates raised their hands in unanimous approval . For the moment Andropov would do without Brezhnev 's second title . <P> The delay in naming a new President could have been a sign that a Kremlin power struggle was still in progress , but the prevailing view in Moscow was that after moving so smoothly to take control of the party , Andropov thought it more prudent to hold back from assuming the post that Brezhnev himself had waited 13 years to take . Indeed , caution seemed to be the watchword for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put his own stamp on the party hierarchy almost immediately , but he made only two important appointments last week . In his first major speech as General Secretary , he offered no bold initiatives in domestic or foreign policy , although he did surprise the Soviets with an unusually blunt critique of the way in which the country 's ailing economy is managed . <P> As Andropov started his second week in office , Kremlinologists watched every move for hints of possible changes in style or policy . The day before the inconclusive session of the Supreme Soviet began , party officials and editors across the Soviet Union had closely monitored bulletins from the government news agency , TASS , for word from a meeting of the Communist Party Central Committee . In theory , all decisions from the Politburo must be ratified by the Central Committee , and it was thought that Andropov would use the closed-door session to announce changes in the top ranks of the leadership .                    @
