And economist Ben Chinitz feels confident the region ' s high-tech businesses will continue to grow . But much of his optimism over this state-of-the-art industry is based on something that happened here more than 150 years ago. // In those days , the big names were Almy and Brown , the Boston Manufacturing Company , and Amoskeag Manufacturing . They were the high-tech companies of the textile business , famous throughout the country for their innovations . And , their dogged attempts to speed up textile manufacturing developed a whole new industry for New Englanders - machine tools. // ' ' We are particularly good at new technology , ' ' says Mr. Chinitz , an economist who specializes in regions . In his living room in Newton , Mass. , hunting through a booklet of data , Chinitz makes a point : New England ' s strength was never really textiles or machine tools , or even electronics . The key to success here is innovation. // ' ' History is our biggest asset , ' ' he says , and this history of innovation will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and business leaders give the region ' s six states top marks in the development of the high-tech industry , saying the growth will continue . They believe the area has a lot of advantages : excellent engineering schools , an abundance of local venture capital , and an established base of high-tech companies to build on . They do foresee some problems - such as competition from Asia and a shortage of scientists and engineers - but nothing peculiar to New England. // In her office overlooking Boston Harbor , Lynn Browne says New England owes a lot to its high-tech centers . An economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston , she explains , ' ' High-tech has changed us from a position where we were much slower than the nation in ( rates of ) manufacturing growth , to where we are much faster . ' ' According to her broad definition of high-tech ( which includes defense , chemicals , office equipment , electronic equipment , aircraft , various transport equipment , and instruments ) , about 10 percent of the people employed in New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national average at about 6 percent. // And , she adds , ' ' high-tech is one of the most important factors that helped us weather the recession . ' ' While the nation suffered 9. 7 percent unemployment for 1982 , New England registered 7. 8 percent . In September it was 6. 5 percent , while the nation stood at 9. 3 percent. // ' ' My bottom-line assessment is optimistic , ' ' Chinitz agrees . He sees New England ' s high-tech growth continuing , ' ' mostly because the demand for these products is strong . Even if we remained static - if we didn ' t do anything to encourage high-tech - we ' d have strong growth because our eggs are in the right basket ' ' // Chinitz , who also is dean of the College of Management Science at the University of Lowell , says New England breeds new ideas . Right now these ideas are taking shape in things like thinking computers and livestock cloning . As long as new concepts keep churning , the region will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology will have to stay in New England to keep up to date , he says. // Looking back in history again , Chinitz says , ' ' If you can imagine the personal computer settling down the way radio did , ' ' then the region may begin to lose a few companies . Thousands of radio companies grew up near New York when the innovations were hot . Once radio became standardized , ' ' that ' s when companies look for a place where they can get distribution all over the country and at the lowest cost . ' ' In radio , the industry went through a shakeout and moved to the Midwest , where distribution was easier and costs lower. // In the meantime , the Northeast continues to go beyond the computer industry and develop other high-technology sectors . The University of Massachusetts - already well-known for its research in the makeup of various materials such as plastics and metals - is setting up a new polymer research center next year to examine and improve these plastics . Other disciplines getting more attention from colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gravity-free science. // The region ' s high-tech leaders all have a different explanation for why New England hangs on to its companies - and keeps sprouting new ones. // Some say it ' s the vast amount of venture capital available to invest in new firms . Along with New York , Chicago , and San Francisco , Boston is a major center for venture capitalists - investors looking for start-up firms with huge potential returns . Business leaders here say no geographic region can hope to spawn strong technological growth unless it has plentiful sources of local funds. // Others praise the academic community here - calling it the best breeding ground in the country for talented engineers. // John Rennie , president of Pacer Systems Inc. and head of the Smaller Business Association of New England , says the interchange between the local universities and businesses is ' ' one of the elements that makes this place go ! ' ' Pacer makes aviation-related equipment and does test and design work for contractors. // Pacer ' s headquarters in Burlington , Mass. , is nestled in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other high-tech firms . The avenue is a stone ' s throw from Route 128 , Boston ' s ' ' technology highway . ' ' Although Mr. Rennie has offices around the country to be close his markets , he says he ' d like the impossible - for all of them to be located here . The degree to which academics and business leaders work together ' ' is higher here than any place in the country , ' ' he says. // Good technical universities abound here , but the one that draws the most acclaim is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . ' ' I wouldn ' t want to claim we have the corner , ' ' says Vincent Fulmer , secretary of the MIT Corporation . At the same time , ' ' we happen to be an engineering powerhouse , ' ' he says. // With quiet pride , Mr. Fulmer lists a slew of ways that MIT interacts with business and government : The university has more than 3 , 000 research contracts and grants ; its professors are active consultants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it sponsors seminars just for small businesses ; many of the Fortune 500 pay an annual fee to gain access to MIT research ; the university makes a point of licensing its patents. // ' ' If this university wants to stay in the lead - if we play the cutting edge - it ' s essential that we stay well-connected with business , ' ' he says . But the connection benefits business , too : About 400 companies have risen from MIT lab research since World War II . ( Fulmer plays this down , though , saying MIT spinoffs are a drop in the bucket of new companies formed. ) // Not only do New England companies turn to the universities for basic research , but they also depend on them for manpower . ' ' New England , by virtue of its academic base , is a very good market for talent , ' ' says John Pasquariello , vice-president , manufacturing , for the Raytheon Company , the largest industrial employer in Massachusetts. // Graduates tend to fan out to companies in the area - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firms get started wherever the guy happens to live . That ' s why the universities are so important , ' ' says economist Browne. // Small firms also hatch from big firms when people in large companies think they can build a better mousetrap , or when employees can ' t convince the companies to act on their ideas . A generation of spinoffs from the major high-tech firms are now growing up in the area . Technology in the region ' ' is now building on itself , ' ' comments Mrs. Browne. // As these new companies are born - or as existing companies expand - the trick is to keep them here. // A number of states have launched mighty marketing campaigns to reel in high-tech firms . Mr. Pasquariello of Raytheon says ' ' active solicitors ' ' visit him regularly , trying to interest the company in expanding to their neck of the woods. // But when they come knocking at Raytheon , they don ' t find a taker. // ' ' They all sound alike , ' ' Pasquariello generalizes . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' They all claim to have low state taxes and state-paid training . They trumpet their quality of life . It would take a very unusual set of circumstances to get us to move . We want to add on to our existing facilities here. ' ' // The real advantage of staying put , he says , is that ' ' we are already here . . . . The continuity of product line and engineering know-how about the product line exists here in plants in New England . ' ' Expanding the electronics division out of the area would be inefficient , he explains . ' ' You would have to move a substantial number of your general people , or face starting with new people and not building on your own know-how. ' ' // Still , business leaders have complaints . John Rennie of Pacer Systems thinks the school system is deteriorating because of Proposition 2 1/2 , which drastically reduced property taxes across the state . And many engineers prefer warmer climes , he says . These things are important when a company recruits engineers. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of engineers . ' ' There is not much free-floating talent , ' ' Rennie says . Companies have to work extra hard to keep employees from jumping ship to another nearby company that may offer a higher salary or a more exciting opportunity . ' ' If anything would limit my ability to grow here it would be the availability of technical people , ' ' he says. // This is a national problem , but it ' s being tackled on the local level . The Massachusetts High Technology Council - a lean , no-nonsense group of local chief executive officers - has convinced its member companies to earmark 2 percent of their annual research and development budgets to local universities . Last year , the amount totaled $54 million . And the council has been a force behind tax reductions . ' ' We buried the slogan , Taxachusetts , ' ' says Howard Foley , president of the council . ' ' Very few people pack up and move out to find a place with lower taxes , ' ' Foley adds , but it ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ //
