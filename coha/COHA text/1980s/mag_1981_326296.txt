The United Presbyterian Church is disunited over a heresy case <P> It all started at a routine meeting of delegates from Presbyterian congregations around Washington in 1979 . On the agenda was the application of United Church of Christ Minister Mansfield M. Kaseman for Presbyterian credentials so he could serve as a clergyman in the Rockville ( Md . ) United Church , which belongs both to Kaseman 's U.C.C. and the United Presbyterian Church . <P> During the meeting , the affable Kaseman was asked whether he believed Jesus Christ is God . " No , " he responded , " God is God . " Kaseman was accepted by a majority . But that answer stirred deep alarm in some delegates . In recent years conservative Presbyterians have had to swallow a fair degree of doctrinal flexibility , but they interpreted Kaseman 's response as a denial of the deity of Christ . The conservatives filed a protest and eventually the Permanent Judicial Commission , the national supreme court of the 2.5 million-member United Presbyterian Church , bounced the case back to the local presbytery for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been the lengthy Westminster Confession of 1647 . It includes the ancient definition of Jesus Christ as " the second Person in the Trinity , being very and eternal God , of one substance and equal with the Father . " At the second examination last March , Kaseman was asked four times about Christ 's bodily Resurrection . He finally said , " I believe in the Resurrection without necessarily believing in the bodily Resurrection . " Though he said he " affirms " the doctrine of the Trinity , as required by the Presbyterian church , he indicated he is uncomfortable with traditional creeds and shuns doctrinal formulas on principle . " For me , " he declared , " the God worth knowing is found more in the quest of liberation than in the pursuit of orthodoxy . " <P> The presbytery again approved Kaseman , again conservatives appealed , and a final hearing was scheduled in Philadelphia before the Permanent Judicial Commission . Maryland Pastor Stewart J.Rankin asked the 14 black-robed judges to bar Kaseman , declaring , " The eternal destiny of mortal souls hangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur R. McKay insisted that Presbyterianism had crossed a " great divide " in 1967 , which conservatives simply refuse to recognize . <P> What had happened in 1967 was that the church broadened its body of creeds and loosened the vows required of new clergy . Presbyterian ministers formerly had to pledge that they " receive and adopt " the Westminster Confession and catechisms . Since 1967 they have only had to promise to be " instructed " and " continually guided " by nine creeds and confessions . The Permanent Judicial Commission decided the local presbytery had been correct in considering Kaseman 's views " within the acceptable range of interpretation " permitted by the new vows .
