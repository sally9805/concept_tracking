LTV Corp. , citing the surging cost of steel scrap , raised prices $40 a ton for hotrolled steel bar and wire products . The increase  --  the latest in a series  --  underscored the sharp rebound in demand for scrap and , to a lesser degree , the general recovery in steel prices this year . Scrap  --  discarded metal or cuttings  --  is remelted in the making of new steel . The nation ' s No. 2 steelmaker said its main unit , Cleveland-based LTV Steel Co. , will impose the $40 a ton surcharge on all new orders placed over the next month . After Nov. 10 , LTV will adjust the surcharge monthly to reflect scrap prices . Shipments of hot-rolled bar  --  a higher-grade product used by the auto and machinery industries  --  accounted for about 8% of the 70. 3 million tons shipped by domestic producers last year , according to industry estimates . Other steelmakers , citing higher scrap costs , imposed smaller increases in bar prices earlier this month . Bethlehem Steel Corp . , Bethlehem , Pa. , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a two-stage increase . Pittsburgh-based USX Corp. , the industry leader , and Inland Steel Industries Inc. later boosted prices by $20 to $25 a ton , effective in January . All three companies said they had LTV ' s action under study to determine if further increases were justified . However , Chicago-based Inland added that it plans for now to stand by its current prices . Rising scrap costs have been one factor in recent steel price hikes . Higher-grade scrap costs have jumped to nearly $160 a ton from $100 a ton early this year , LTV said . Other steel executives estimate the average price of scrap of all grades has risen $30 a ton since May . Scrap is mainly used by so-called mini-mills  --  small-scale plants that melt the discarded metal in electric furnaces to produce the molten steel that is later shaped into finished products . Thus , rising scrap costs have mostly sparked increases in mini-mill product lines , such as bar and certain structural steels . Integrated steelmakers  --  operating large-scale furnaces  --  mostly rely on hot metal produced from iron ore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25% to 30% of their furnace needs with scrap , and some operate electric furnaces for specific product lines . As a result , rising scrap prices have contributed to higher costs for products dominated by large producers , such as flat-rolled steel . Industry executives and analysts cite several reasons for higher scrap costs . " Scrap prices were so low that they were ready to rise with the slightest increase in demand , " said Howard M. Myers , president and chief executive officer of Laplace , La. - based Bayou Steel Corp . He predicted a continued uptick in scrap prices . While demand for scrap has risen , supply has been curtailed . The plunging dollar has encouraged U.S. exports of scrap , and improved steelmaking processes such as continuous casting has meant less waste  --  and less scrap . " When you put all these things together , you don ' t get a scrap shortage but you do get higher prices , " said Charles Bradford , a steel analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets . Mr. Bradford expects scrap prices to rise further , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dallas-based LTV said it will stagger its surcharge . The added per-ton charge will be $15 for November delivery , $25 for December delivery and $40 for January delivery . The surcharge for February deliveries will be set at the next monthly review of scrap costs Nov. 10 , LTV said . In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , LTV was unchanged at $3. 625 a share . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
