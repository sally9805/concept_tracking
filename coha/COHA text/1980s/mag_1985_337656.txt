The Israeli army last week continued its slow withdrawal from southern Lebanon , pulling back from the area around the town of Nabatiyah as Lebanese cheered their departure . Another milestone was reached : the tenth anniversary of Lebanon 's seemingly endless civil war , which has cost more than 100,000 lives . <P> On an explosive day in April 1975 , Christian militiamen ambushed a Palestinian bus in East Beirut , killing 37 passengers . That action is generally recognized as the incident that sparked the civil war . The present government of " national unity , " set up last year under Syrian aegis , is virtually powerless , and the country continues to be beset by sectarian fighting , most seriously last week around the southern port city of Sidon . There , for the third week in a row , Christian militiamen battled Muslim units of the Lebanese Army and Muslim irregulars . <P> Among the weary Lebanese , there are few who see much hope . " If you had told / me ten years ago that the war would go on for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says a Christian publisher in East Beirut . " Tell me now that it will continue for another ten years , and I will merely shrug . We 're numb . "
