Unless Congress restores some of the deep cuts it has already ordered in the American payment , Elliot L. Richardson , a former Cabinet member and former delegate to the United Nations , says the world body will face this year " the most serious financial crisis in its history. " // The organization may have to endure " payless paydays , " he said , or it may even " have to close its doors. " // Mr. Richardson is chairman of the United Nations Association of the United States , an advocacy group that has been convening a series of " emergency meetings " in Washington to muster letter-writing campaigns and other pressures on Congress against the most severe cuts . <> <> A Unanimous Prediction // But at one such meeting on Capitol Hill last week , attended by representatives of 50 national church and service groups that support the United Nations , the judgment was unanimous among a panel of members of Congress and Administration officials that the United States contribution is going to be cut significantly , perhaps by $100 million. // That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a signatory to the United Nations Charter . Based on a formula that calculates each country ' s dues according to its gross national product , the United States is responsible for 25 percent of the world body ' s annual budget , which means an American payment of a bit over $200 million in a current budget of $805 million. // Under provisions of the international organizations funding bill that cleared the House Appropriations Committee today , the United States support of the United Nations budget would drop to 17 percent in the payment that is due this fall. // The depth of this cut in American support is a result of increasing impatience and open hostility toward the United Nations on the part of Congress and the Administration. // At the daylong United Nations Association forum last week that filled to overflowing the hearing room of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , Representative Dante B. Fascell , the committee chairman , who is an undoubted friend of the United Nations , called the organization " indispensable to the United States. " // But his speech emphasized what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support this year , he told the United Nations partisans , in effect , to forget it. // Mr. Fascell said American " frustration and anger at the U.N. is real " and comes at a time when the Congressional mood of budget stringency is strong . To argue that Congress is honor-bound to observe " treaty obligations , " he predicted , would " go nowhere. " // " I see no surcease as far as the U.N. is concerned , " Mr. Fascell said . " A fair translation of our policy is that ' Uncle Sam is tired of being a patsy and all of you in the rest of the world step up and take care of it. ' " // The action today by the House Appropriations Committee follows several other anti-United Nations budget moves in Congress. // The American payment that is due this fall was already expected to be cut , to 20 percent of the United Nations budget , under a measure signed into law a year ago by President Reagan . That measure , sponsored by Senator Nancy L. Kassebaum , Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United Nations General Assembly agrees to a " weighted voting " procedure on budget issues . The voting procedure , regarded as unlikely to gain General Assembly approval , would give the United States and other big contributors a larger vote on the United Nations budget , which American critics say is now controlled by nations with very small membership assessments , some of less than 1 percent. // Meantime , the Federal budget-balancing law , which Congress adopted after passage of the Kassebaum measure , requires an even larger cut , $100 million , in the payment to the United Nations . And the cutting may not stop there. // There remains the amendment sponsored by Representative Don Sundquist , Republican of Tennessee , that became law with strong support among conservatives . It is an effort to withhold from the United States ' payment an amount equivalent to the millions of dollars - no one can officially say how many millions - paid to United Nations employees who , because they are nationals of Soviet bloc countries , are required to " kick back " portions of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Department and the Capitol say the Sundquist amendment ' s cuts are too " esoteric " to be put into place this year without definite figures . Others are fearful that the Sundquist amendment may result in further fiscal harm to the United Nations. // " The Kassebaum cut is not even operative under the larger Gramm-Rudman cuts , " said Representative Jim Leach , an Iowa Republican who is a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee . " I am very much afraid , " he said , " that the U.N. is going to do considerably worse " under the Sundquist amendment than it would have fared under the Kassebaum amendment alone . <> <> Cut Would Be ' Punishing ' // At the United Nations , James Sutterlin , director of the Secretary General ' s executive office , says that , whatever the amount of the United States cut , it will be " punishing . " Mr. Sutterlin said that even if the cut is calculated at $67 million , together with other countries ' delinquencies that would leave the United Nations with " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking mitigation of the most draconian American reduction argue in behalf of the United Nations that , under the leadership of Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar , it has trimmed $60 million from spending plans . They are also optimistic about a study by a blue-ribbon panel that is expected to recommend to the General Assembly this fall a long list of other changes that may be attractive to the United States. // Referring to efforts to force the United Nations to consider internal changes , Mr. Sutterlin said , " Some good may come of it , if it is not in the meantime fatal.
