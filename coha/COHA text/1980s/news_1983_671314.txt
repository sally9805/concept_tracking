Los Angeles Rams demonstrated the outrage of Dallas Cowboy fans , if " fans " is the right word for people who whine when their team doesn ' t reach the conference final every season. // But the sound around the National Football League yesterday was decidedly not the licking of chops over the elimination of the Cowboys from the playoffs . The noise was that of most general managers ' going back to work to try to catch the Cowboys. // " I ' m not particularly a great fan of the Dallas Cowboys , " said George Young , the general manager of the Giants , who are stuck in the same division as the Cowboys and the Washington Redskins , " but to stay on top as long as the Cowboys have done reflects a solid organization , from Tex Schramm to Gil Brandt to Tom Landry. // " Great teams and great people become victims of their own legends . People vilify them if they don ' t win all the time. " // The most enduring image of the Cowboys this season will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , furiously shouting , " No ! No ! " as his quarterback , Danny White , changed signals for a fourth- down play that didn ' t work at midfield against the Redskins. // To all members of the I Hate Dallas Club - and there really is // such a club ; it is based in New Orleans , where there has never been a playoff game - this foulup on national television seemed to indicate that the grim blue , gray and white Spaceship Dallas had lost one tiny screw , a loss that was going to send it veering out of orbit for eternity. // Ernie Accorsi doesn ' t believe that for a minute . Accorsi , a former sports reporter who is now general manager of the Baltimore Colts , said yesterday : " The Cowboys could be in the Super Bowl next year . I wouldn ' t write them off. " // Every administrator wants to build a winner . Donald Trump , the vibrant new owner of the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League , a builder by trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sipe as quarterback yesterday . The Seattle Seahawks prospered this year because they had scouted Dave Krieg , from now-defunct Milton College , and Pete Metzelaars , from tiny Wabash College. // " This is a very competitive business , " said George Young . " All 28 teams are trying to improve . People don ' t remember that . It ' s very hard to stay up there , but the Cowboys do. " // Accorsi said : " The Cowboys remind me a lot of the Orioles . From 1972 to 1978 , they didn ' t win a pennant , but they still had the same quality team . One year it looked as if they were falling apart going into Boston , and they won the whole weekend series and nearly won the pennant . Then they came back and won the pennant in 1979 and the World Series this year. // " The Cowboys were one game from the Super Bowl for three straight years . One year it took a super play , Montana to Clark , to beat them . One year they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year it was the Redskins , who are a better team right now . But the Cowboys will continue to win. // " Sure , they ' ve got some old players . Every club does . But if you have the right people , you can replace them . They ' ve got great talent and great coaching . Nobody knows that better than we do. " // Last summer Accorsi had " mixed " // scouting reports about Raul // Allegre , a rookie " who tried out with the Cowboys because he thought he could learn something from Rafael Septien , who ' s also Mexican. " // " Allegre worked with their kicking instructor , Ben Agajanian , who was one of the great kickers , " Accorsi said , " and when we were looking for a kicker , the Cowboys said , ' Take a look at Allegre. ' // " We saw that Agajanian had taught him how to get the ball up . We got him for a ninth-round draft choice , and he was our most valuable player . They taught him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great coaching makes their draft choices and their talent look even better. " // Is it possible that the Cowboy organization is really slipping , what with numerous suggestions of drug problems in Dallas , and with Clint Murchison ' s unrelated move in putting the team on the market . Landry could switch to Gary Hogeboom at quarterback . Or he might even decide to retire - despite his insistence yesterday that he wouldn ' t - and that could change the Cowboys . But Accorsi notes that the current leadership has " great faith in the system " and says that , if those leaders remain , " I don ' t see them tinkering with it. " // As the Cowboys lost their final three games this season , their secondary looked weak , and Tony Dorsett - or maybe it was the offensive line - never established a running game . However , it was Danny White who heard the howls from the not-so- faithful . White became the regular quarterback when Roger Staubach retired after the 1979 season , with two Super Bowl championships behind him. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall of Famer , " George Young said . " Danny White is a heck of a good quarterback , but he ' s not a Hall of Famer . I think it ' s unfair for the fans to focus on him. " // Yet Texas fans did rain down // abuse on Danny White , just as // New York fans abuse the Giants for never even coming close to the Super Bowl and just as New York fans screamed when the Jets fell short of expectations this season. // " It ' s the nature of the game , " George Young said . " There ' s a buildup for a whole week . It ' s a Roman Coliseum game . It saddens me that it is , but it is . Other sports are not the same. " // A baseball team can finish in third place , and the manager can brag that " we won 90 games , " and the front office can publicize its 20-game winner or its rookie home run star . The Colts , coached by Frank Kush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , and Accorsi said : // " We can ' t get away with that next year . Maybe we could go 9-7 and lose a tiebreaker for the playoffs , but basically we ' ve got to make the playoffs or people won ' t be happy . Then , if you make the playoffs , people want to know why you didn ' t win the conference title. " // That ' s the high level the Dallas Cowboys have reached , and where they remain , rant and rave though Texas residents do . George Young of the Giants said , " I ' d rather be in that category than never get there at all . " His team won 3 , lost 12 and tied 1 this year . His fans howled , too . Football is basically not a happy business. // //
