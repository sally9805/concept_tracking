The Olympic torch burns brightly and warmly <P> Perhaps what is most surprising is the tears . Such as those that came to the eyes of the young boy watching from a bed in front of a Connecticut hospital when the runner paused by his side and let him hold the torch . Even Joey Glenn , a 15-year-old in a Van Halen T shirt who hardly seems the crying type , admitted that the sight of the proud flame made him feel like " crying for America " as he watched from the dry roadside in Collinsville , Texas . Almost as surprising is the excitement : the deaf children in West Virginia who each got to pass the torch , then broke into a flurry of sign language ; the thundering chants of " USA ! U-S-A ! " that erupted in St. Louis ; the 4,000 people in Oklahoma City who crowded so close to Runner Ken Hardwick that he could only walk his route . <P> What started as a venturesome symbol , attacked as blatant commercialism by the Soviets when they boycotted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outpouring of good feeling for community and country . Flown to the U.S. in miner 's lamps from Greece , the Olympic flame is being carried on a serpentine 82-day , 8,700-mile journey through 33 states to the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles . The runners include more than 200 regulars ( a team of experienced amateur runners sponsored by A T &; T who form the core of the relay ) and 3,500 local torchbearers who have raised or donated $3,000 for the privilege of carrying the flame for one kilometer ( five-eighths of a mile ) . The money that is raised goes to athletic programs for youth clubs and the Special Olympics . " I think it 's all right , " drawled D.L. Morton , 80 , of Tioga , Texas . " Patriotism . You hardly see it any more . " <P> The runners are frequently besieged by people seeking autographs or taking pictures , eager to touch the torch or even its bearer . Roberta Ciccarelli , 38 , a schoolteacher in Blairsville , Ga. , raised $2,150 by knocking on doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the rest . When she trotted through Blairsville , 1,000 people lined the route , cheering her on . " I kept hearing people yelling my name , ' Go , Robbie ! ' and ' Come on , Mrs. Ciccarelli ! ' I do n't remember breathing . My lungs did n't hurt , my legs did n't hurt . It was like nothing I had ever experienced . " <P> Nancy Nix , 9 , of Gainesville , Ga. , announced to her mother at breakfast one day that she wanted to be part of the Olympics . After Mrs. Nix persuaded AT &T; to waive its requirement that runners be ten years old or older , she and her daughter set about raising the money . " We baked Easter cakes , Mother 's Day cakes , pound cakes and sheet cakes , " Nancy 's mother recalls . Nancy made some of her own crafts and set about selling them to her neighbors . When her turn came , she took off so fast that she passed up the press truck and had to be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward . " There were a lot of people . But I was proud . " <P> Jay Rowell , 14 , of Richardson , Texas , whose legs are crippled , carried the torch last week in a specially designed wheelchair . A local auto dealer had donated the money for his kilometer . " I pushed around my block four times-that 's three miles-last night to get in shape , " Jay said proudly .
