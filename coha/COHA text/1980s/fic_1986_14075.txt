A part of a waiting room in a nursing home . Two chairs on one side of the stage , a chair and a table with a small radio on it on the other . A prominent entrance . The radio is playing the pop version of the famous Tschaikowsky Piano Concerto . The music fades under a voice with a very thick Southern accent . RADIO A moment ago , you heard that gorgeous pop standard made from Rachmaninov 's 2nd Piano Concerto . Continuing on our program this morning , " From Carnegie Hall to Tin Pan Alley and Back Again , " we hear Tschaikowsky 's 1st Piano Concerto in its golden oldie pop identity . Do n't go away , classical purists , we will hear all these originals in their glory in one half an hour . But now , more Songs of Love ! ( A soupy rendition of the Tschaikowsky keeps on playing . The door opens . Enter Susan Logan , a young nurse . She looks at the waiting room , thinks a minute , shrugs and goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SUSAN Please , come in ! ( Enter Lillian Barbow , her brother Buddy Slade , both in middle age and Finley Runney , a young man . Susan wears her uniform with an attractive sweater over it . Lillian wears soft colors and flowing materials : a Southern lady 's afternoon dress . Buddy wears a conservative , well cut suit , with cowboy boots and a hat not a cowboy hat but which he wears like one . Finley wears a very neat business suit . All three are well off. ) p. 3 LILLIAN This is n't the Director 's Office . Where 's the Director ? SUSAN He is n't in today . We can talk here . FINLEY Not at all ? SUSAN I 'm afraid not . I am Director of Nurses . I will be happy to do my best for you until he returns . FINLEY When is that ? SUSAN Next month . FINLEY Next MONTH ? SUSAN Director Wilson is a delegate to ANNHA . He 's at the Convention . BUDDY ANN  --  HA ? LILLIAN What 's that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loud music and wimmen talking give me the jim-jams . SUSAN Of course . I beg your pardon . ( She turns off the radio . ) BUDDY Love song . Just what we wanted to hear . LILLIAN Buddy . BUDDY Well , id n't it ? SUSAN ANNHA stands for American National Nursing Homes Association . The yearly convention is being held this month in Omaha , Nebraska . As an elected delegate , Director Wilson has many important duties and wo n't be back for at least ten days . p. 4 BUDDY Swell . LILLIAN All right , we 'll talk to you . ( She sits in one of the chairs . The others remain standing . ) SUSAN Fine . BUDDY Put some some saltpeter in his food . LILLIAN Buddy . BUDDY Get him a VCR and some Swedish Erotica . LILLIAN Hush ! BUDDY Or tie a damn knot in it , how 's that ? ( Lillian stands up . ) BUDDY All right ! Sorry ! Do n't mean to act up . ( She sits back down . ) LILLIAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we both expected to see him here today . SUSAN Well , I 'm sorry . He did n't tell me a thing . But I 'll do everything I can for you . FINLEY Maybe you will and maybe you wo n't . Go ahead , Mrs. Barbow . LILLIAN Thank you , Mr. Runney . I apologize if my brother said anything offensive about your father . FINLEY Quite all right . Let 's just go ahead . LILLIAN Very well . My mother , Cora Slade  --  p. 5 BUDDY My momma , too ! LILLIAN Our mother , Cora Slade , has been in residence at Woodvale Nursing Home since January of this year . Beginning last month , she has been repeatedly molested here . After our phone conversation with Doctor Wilson three weeks ago , we believed the situation had been corrected . SUSAN Oh , I see . LILLIAN I thought you might . SUSAN Mrs. Slade and Mr. Runney . FINLEY Yes ! SUSAN So what 's happened now ? LILLIAN You mean you do n't know ? SUSAN I saw them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FINLEY Together ? SUSAN Yes , in lounge chairs they like in the Day Room . They sit in them side by side , with blankets , like passengers on ships in old movies . BUDDY Two blankets or one ? SUSAN One . Rather a joke here . LILLIAN Not to me , it is n't . Not to my brother . Nor , I trust , to Mr. Runney . FINLEY Absolutely not . p. 6 SUSAN You feel they are doing something improper ? BUDDY He comes to her room , do n't he ? SUSAN During visiting hours , yes . LILLIAN And they shut the door ? SUSAN If they wish . BUDDY And they 're in there together , all by theirselves ? SUSAN Since Mrs. Slade is able to afford a single room , yes , again . LILLIAN Well ? SUSAN Well ? LILLIAN Director Wilson gave us his solemm promise this kind of behavior would not occur at Woodvale Nursing Home ! ( Susan laughs . ) SUSAN Oh , did he ? BUDDY You diddledamn right he did , Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beg your pardon . LILLIAN You do n't seem to understand , Miss  --  ah  --  I forget your name  --  SUSAN Logan , Susan . R. N. LILLIAN  --  Nurse Logan , how serious a matter this is . This is our eighty year old mother we 're concerned about , in your care , your very expensive care , being sexually molested ! p. 7 FINLEY If you please . Molested is a strong word , used most often I believe , in connection with the abuse of children . My grandfather is not a sex criminal . SUSAN Mrs. Barbow , when was the last time your mother complained about Mr. Runney ? ( Pause . ) LILLIAN Yes , I thought you 'd ask me that . BUDDY Momma do n't say nothing . LILLIAN We think she 's afraid to . BUDDY Or worse . He 's made her like it ! LILLIAN Buddy , please ! SUSAN Mrs. Barbow , has your mother complained to you about Mr. Runney 's behavior ? LILLIAN Not in so many words , no . FINLEY Then how do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? BUDDY We got our sources . SUSAN Someone at Woodvale ? LILLIAN Yes ! FINLEY I 've had calls , too ! But not about a sex fiend ! About a seductive old woman making a fool of a gentle old man ! BUDDY Oh , sure . p. 8 FINLEY How she will not let him alone . How she hangs all over him when he should be getting his rest . How she drags him day and night in and out of her room ! LILLIAN And what WE hear is how HE wo n't let HER alone ! How SHE ca n't go anywhere without HIM ! How HE 'S in and out of HER room day and night any time HE feels like it ! BUDDY So what are you going to do about it ? SUSAN ( Politely . ) What do you expect me to do about it ? LILLIAN Separate them ! SUSAN How ? LILLIAN I do n't care ! Just do it ! SUSAN Very well , but how ? BUDDY Saltpeter , VCR , Swedish Erotica , and a knot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hush up ! BUDDY Sorry ! SUSAN You are asking me to use force ? LILLIAN If necessary , yes ! Lord knows what he may be doing to her ! Our mother ! SUSAN I will try to explain something to you . But first . ( To Finley . ) Mr. Runney , do you feel your grandfather and Mrs. Slade must be kept apart by force ? p. 9 FINLEY I may , yes . But what is it you have to explain ? SUSAN It is a familiar story in nursing homes . A lady and a gentleman , of advanced age , both ambulatory and reasonably healthy , neither mentally impaired or senile in any way , form a final , strong attachment to each other . It is sometimes physical . There is a medical term for it : sexual recrudesence . Brought on by a new environment , new friends , freedom from past restrictions , like marriage and children and work at home . It happens . And it 's a delicate matter . BUDDY What 's delicate about it for God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , then what 's to keep him from going around here sticking it and place he wants to ? He 's in hog heaven , right ? FINLEY Oh , really . Ugh . BUDDY What 's the matter with you , sonny ? You unaquainted with the realities of life , or what ? LILLIAN While I can not approve of my brother 's language , Mr. Runney , I ca n't say it is entirely beside the point . FINLEY Well , I can . My grandfather is not a buzzard or a hog , Mr. Slade . He is a Lieutenant Colonel , retired , United States Army , and this place to which he is confined is most certainly not heaven . Please let Nurse Logan finish what she has to say . p. 10 BUDDY Well , hoo-ee , get her . LILLIAN Buddy , you are my brother , and you are repulsive . Hush ! FINLEY Just let her finish ? PLEASE ? ( Pause . ) Nurse Logan ? ( Pause . ) SUSAN There 's nothing else to say . Shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just tell Momma we 're here . FINLEY And my grandfather I am . SUSAN Certainly . It 's 1:30 . They should both be in the Day Room . I 'll be right back . ( Exit Susan . Pause . They look about . Buddy sprawls in one of the chairs . Finley takes the chair next to Lillian . Pause . ) LILLIAN You say your grandfather was a Lieutenant Colonel ? FINLEY He still is . Officers of the American Army , when they retire , keep their rank . LILLIAN When did he serve in the Army ? FINLEY He won a battlefield commission in World War II . He became a Logistics Staff Officer for the Allied Expeditionary Forces , rising to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel . LILLIAN I see . FINLEY And your mother ? p. 11 BUDDY Never you mind about our Momma ! LILLIAN Hush up , Buddy . Our mother , Mr. Runney , is a plain Southern housewife , has been all her life . She never joined anything more exciting than her Garden Club . But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with grace and dignity and honor . Now she is old , no doubt severely confused , and we will not allow her to be taken advantage of in her last years on earth ! ( Enter Susan . ) SUSAN They 're on their way . BUDDY Wait a minute . Both of ' em ? LILLIAN We want to talk to our mother , not to him . FINLEY And I want to talk to him and not your mother . Meet her here and I 'll see my grandfather somewhere else . LILLIAN Thank you , sir . That 's what we 'll do ! SUSAN Sorry . No . BUDDY Whadda you mean no ? SUSAN Mrs. Slade and Mr. Runney will only see you together . ( Pause . ) BUDDY Huh ? LILLIAN I beg your pardon ? FINLEY My grandfather wo n't see me alone ? p. 12 SUSAN Together , or not at all . BUDDY Mama ? LILLIAN Is this their idea or yours ? SUSAN That was a direct quote . BUDDY From which one ? SUSAN From Colonel Runney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't agree to this ! FINLEY I do n't either ! BUDDY No way ! ( The door opens . Colonel Runney and Mrs Slade stand in the doorway . They are very weak and vulnerable . They both show their hard age and frailty . Ellis Runney is a ragged gentleman with spindley and very weak legs , unkempt hair , clean but faded clothes , perhaps a ragged sweater too big for him and he has tremors in his hands . His skin is white and flaky , dotted with the blemishes of age . But he walks with upright pride , and a fierce , defiant eye . He holds in each hand a stick with a large white card attached to it . Cora Slade is a wisp of a woman , with snow white hair , skin like wrinkled parchment , an old woman 's hesitations and uncertainties , and a ragdoll she clutches fearfully to herself . She is dressed in a Southern Granny dress , a very loose faded calico sack garment , and wears tennis shoes to keep from falling . She carries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They look as if any step outside the nursing home is absolutely impossible. ) p. 13 SUSAN Well , here they are . ( Pause . ) Shall we sit down ? ( Ellis holds up one of the cards on the sticks . It says in big shaky black letters : " NEGATIVE ! " ) You do n't want to sit down , Colonel Runney ? ( He holds up the other card . It says : " POSITIVE ! " ) Would you like US to sit down ? ( " POSITIVE ! " ) LILLIAN Oh , Mother . FINLEY Granpa Ellis ? BUDDY Momma , let go of that man and come on over here ! Just do it RIGHT NOW ! ( Cora and Ellis look at each other . As one , they turn and slowly start out the door . ) LILLIAN Now , Mother , please ! BUDDY Do n't be like that ! FINLEY We 'll sit down , we 'll sit down ! ( He does . Ellis and Cora turn and look at them . Lillian and Buddy slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stand there together . ) SUSAN Do you want me to stay ? ( " POSITIVE ! " ) All right . ( She folds her hands , stands by . Pause . ) LILLIAN Mother , we want to know if you are all right here . ( " POSITIVE ! " ) p. 14 BUDDY LET HER SPEAK FOR HERSELF ! ( " NEGATIVE " ) MOMMA ! FINLEY I told you my grandfather was a military man ! Those cards mean what they say . Granpa Ellis . You still love me ? ( Pause . " POSITIVE ! " ) You want to hurt me ? ( " NEGATIVE ! " ) You really do care about Mrs. Slade . ( " POSITIVE ! " ) Have you  --  forced your attentions on her ? ( Before Ellis can respond , Cora takes the " NEGATIVE ! " sign and holds it up . Then she hands it back to Ellis . ) Granpa Ellis , are you in love with Mrs. Slade ? ( " POSITIVE ! " ) Mrs. Slade , are you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POSITIVE ! " sign and flashes it : " POSITIVE ! " then gives it back . ) Then God bless you , Granpa Ellis . And you too , Mrs. Slade . SUSAN Well . That 's honest and open and nice . Mrs. Barbow ? LILLIAN Mother , why wo n't you talk to us ? ( Cora smiles , looks at Ellis , who shakes his head . ) BUDDY See that ? Got her just where he wants her . Damn ! LILLIAN Mother , all we are doing is making sure you are well and untroubled . But it is hard , when you wo n't even speak to us . ( Pause . ) Well , if you wo n't talk , you wo n't . Come on , Buddy . She 's being impossible . Let her have him , and God help her . Let 's go . ( She gets up . Cora hands Susan three letters . She reads the first one. ) p. 15 SUSAN ( Reading aloud . ) " Cora Namwaite Slade and Lieutenant Colonel Ellis Marvin Runney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a private place . " BUDDY Married ? Aye God , Momma ! FINLEY ( Simultaneous . ) Oh , dear ! LILLIAN Now we sit down ! ( They sit quickly . ) SUSAN ( Reading . ) " Our bills here are paid . Security deposit plus three months rent at Bellevue Towers is paid . Our bags are packed . A taxi arrives here at fourteen hundred hours , to take us home . " LILLIAN Home ? Oh , Mother , really ! FINLEY Since the taxi is coming at two , and it is now one forty-five , whatever is going to be done should I think be done quickly , do n't you agree ? BUDDY Ai n't no taxi taking nobody nowhere , I 'll guarantee that ! LILLIAN Mother , marriage is a serious step . ( Susan laughs . Finley laughs . ) Please ! FINLEY Sorry . SUSAN I beg your pardon . LILLIAN Mother , you ca n't have known Mr. Runney  --  p. 16 FINLEY Colonel Runney  --  LILLIAN LIEUTENANT Colonel Runney  --  for very long . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dreadful mistake . ( Ellis flashes : " NEGATIVE ! " Cora puts her hand gently over his , and pushes the card down . The she smiles at Lillian and shrugs , conveying , " So what if I do ? " ) Mother , it 's very hard when you wo n't talk to me . I am your daughter , Lillian , who 's done more for you than  --  and never mind that , just stop with these silly cards and speak to me ! ( Cora raises the card in Ellis 's hand : " NEGATIVE ! " ) It is n't just getting married . It 's doing it without telling us , or consulting us . If we had n't come here today , what would you have done ? Just driven off with him ? ( Cora and Ellis flash : " POSITIVE ! " ) You understand , Mother , marriage , even at your age , means sex ? You would have to submit to this man 's carnal desires ? ( Cora waves : " POSITIVE ! " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you better than this . You are not a promiscuous woman . You had your children and you moved into your own bedroom and slept by yourself in peace and dignity , and I admired you for it . I have done exactly the same . It is a great relief . But now you will have to accommodate a man again . This man , with real or imaginary sexual needs . ( " POSITIVE ! " ) You put that down ! ! ( She smiles , speaks calmly . ) Mother , this is the point . You have been put in this home by your loving children because the plain fact is , you ca n't take care of yourself any more . Remember the lost check books ? Yes . Remember the missed appointments you could n't remember you made ? Yes . Remember the forgotten house , which you lived in for sixty years and and one pretty day could n't find ? Yes . Remember the telephone calls to people dead thirty years and front doors left open and the burned food , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the kitchen , pantry and dining room in flames ? Yes . And now you want to get married , to upset the practical arrangements so carefully made for you . You are thinking about no one but yourself . What will you do ? Take half your estate from your children and grandchildren , and give it to a man you hardly know ? Next you 'll want to make a new will , and give it all away ! No . You are incompetent , Mother , and you are staying here . ( Cora nods to Susan . She reads the second letter. ) p. 17 SUSAN ( Reading . ) TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERNI have examined Cora Namwaite Slade and Colonel Ellis Marvin Runney and I find them for their ages sound in mind and body . I approve their release from Woodvale Nursing Home.Richard MacFarland , M.D. LILLIAN And who is he ? SUSAN Their private physician . They are not in legal custody . BUDDY But we signed her in here ! We pay five thousand damn dollars a month for that room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Attorney . There will be no moving anywhere without our permission . ( Cora nods to Susan . She reads the third letter . ) SUSAN ( Reading ) TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERNCora Namwaite Slade , being sound in mind and body , hereby revokes Power of Attorney granted May 12 , 1984 , to her daughter , Lillian Slade Barbow.Robert CostangoAttorney at LawSenior Citizen 's Legal Association BUDDY You mean Momma can just walk out of here , and start writing checks ? LILLIAN It ca n't be legal . SUSAN I think it is . BUDDY Mamma 's money ! Paydirt , at last ! ( To Susan . ) How much she pay you , Lady ? Everybody knows you milk every tit you can get hold of in an old folks home . p. 18 LILLIAN Buddy , really , just die , will you ? BUDDY She 's earned her percentage ! Lieutenant Colonel Runney , sir , he 'll get half Mama 's estate when she dies , tell me I 'm wrong ! FINLEY If she dies first , Mr. Slade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave her his swagger stick , right ? How much is this Lieutenant Colonel in the damn Army worth , anyway ? LILLIAN That is a vulgar question , in vulgarity put , does not deserve an answer , and at the moment , anyway , is beside the point . BUDDY So what is the god damn point ? LILLIAN ( Pointing . ) That doll . BUDDY Say what ? LILLIAN Our mother , Buddy , see , is clutching , if you have n't noticed , a rag doll . It is very important to her . She is obviously in a dependent , infantile state , therefore she is incompetent , therefore she can be proven so , doctor or no doctor . Would any responsible medical professional send an old woman out into the cold world with her dolly ? SUSAN Dolls can be therapy for elderly women . Men , too , at times . She made that one herself . Colonel Runney helped her . We also bring in little animals twice a week . They are petted , handled , talked to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it brings old people toward reality , not away from it . p. 19 BUDDY She 's got an answer for everything . Be quiet , Lillian , and let her answer this , if she will . What 's in it for you ? ( They all look at her . ) SUSAN ( Fed up . ) Have to know , do you ? ( They look at Buddy . ) BUDDY Hell yes I have to know . Let 's have it ! ! ( They look back at Susan . Pause . ) SUSAN I like old people , Mr. Slade . They appeal to me . Not because of the fortune I extort from them or the salary I command as a nurse . Not because I enjoy seeing doctors give them drugs totally unnecessary , X-Rays they do n't need , in some homes pack them in four and five to a room , order them liquor and make drunks out of them , neglect them , tie them down , beat them up , leave them fallen sometimes broken in their own waste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand until we face old age ourselves . It 's in spite of all that , Mr. Slade , they still appeal to me . Why ? Because at the edge of existence , with the ground crumbling away under their feet , with life tearing away everything it gave , with a few outbursts and tantrums , some whining and shouting , in this world they are still the most gallant people I know . And when a lady like Mrs. Slade and a gentleman like Colonel Runney meet and find each other , I watch them grow younger ! p. 20 LILLIAN Do what ? BUDDY ( Simultaneous . ) Aw , shoot ! FINLEY ( Simultaneous . ) Now , really ! SUSAN You can scoff at it , and deny it . Doctors can call it demeaning names like sexual recrudesence , but I think it 's just fine , they 're doing better right now with their love life than I am , and if they can get that together , I say let them keep it ! LILLIAN Thank you , young woman , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let me hear no more of it . ( She stands up , faces Cora . ) You are an old woman , Mother . Not a doll , not a girl . You are sick , you are senile , you need constant care , and that 's what you are going to get . I will not let my own mother commit sexual suicide . ( Ellis steps forward , holding out , " NEGATIVE ! " ) LILLIAN , FINLEY AND BUDDY Not now ! ( He backs away . ) LILLIAN Because it wo n't be a second honeymoon , Mother . It will be a nightmare of misery and pain and squalor which will kill you years ahead of your time . ( Ellis tries to hold out " NEGATIVE ! " again . ) And you , sir ! Can you , as an officer and a gentleman , do that to her ? Take away her last years of peaceful existence ? Not if you really love her ! ( Finley gets up. ) p. 21 FINLEY Granpa Ellis , I have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lobby , where we can talk to each other rationally . But you stay here . ( Ellis holds up " NEGATIVE ! " while Cora takes and holds up , " POSITIVE ! " They look at each other , in confusion , and lower the cards . ) Listen to whatever they say . Think . Look . Then come out and talk to me alone , please . I do not think I will have much trouble in showing you how shallow and trivial these people are . After that , if you must live with HER , very well , but understand you will also have to live with THEM ! I know you ca n't do it . I will be waiting . ( Exit Finley . ) LILLIAN And vice versa , Mother . How will you like that effete little snob looking down on YOU ? ( Pause . Cora turns away . ) Come on , Buddy . She wo n't do it now . ( Exit Lillian . Buddy stands looking at his mother . ) BUDDY Momma . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mouth . But I dote on my Momma . Bettern anybody . I do . ( Buddy kneels in front of his mother . ) Do n't marry nobody . Next Sunday , I 'll pick you some blue gentians , just like I did when I was a boy , and you doted on me . I promise , Momma . All right ? ( Buddy gets up . ) Good . I trust you , Momma . I 'll see you next Sunday . Bye . ( He tiptoes out . Cora , shaken , moves away from Ellis . Susan sets a chair out for Cora , who sits in it , wearily . She looks at Ellis. ) p. 22 ELLIS I have to  --  go  --  talk to him . ( Exit Ellis . Cora , quietly , hugs her doll and sways back and forth , sadly . ) SUSAN He 'll be right back . I 'm sure he will . ( Cora shakes her head . Susan goes toward her , but Cora holds up her hand to keep her away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you . ( Pause . She goes to her desk , sits . Pause . She tries to read a magizine , ca n't . She looks at Cora . ) Can I get you something ? Some tea , some milk ? ( Cora shakes her head . Pause . Susan tries to read again . Pause . Quietly , Cora begins to cry . ) Oh , Mrs. Slade . CORA He does n't love me . SUSAN Oh , dear . ( Pause . ) We 'll stay here as long as you want . I 'll play you some music . ( She turns on the radio , tuned still to the program heard at the beginning of the play . Playing is the Tschaikovsky Concerto itself , one minute thirty seconds into the first movement , where the piano , between climaxes , plays trills and flourishes , music aimless and dull . Pause . Cora weeps , quietly , hugging her doll . She gets up and moves away from the music . A taxi horn is heard . ) The Taxi . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage . Outside , the taxi blows its horn again . Cora sits in a chair on the other side of the stage . She sags , her doll almost falling from her hands , stricken with grief . The door flies open . In staggers Ellis . He holds up his " POSITIVE ! " sign . The music bursts into a climax from speakers all over the theatre . Ellis goes to the chair where he last saw Cora . She is n't there ! He is horrified . Susan points to Cora . He turns around . Cora rises . She and Ellis stare at each other . They stagger together . They embrace . They kiss . They drop the sign and the doll . Stumbling , limping , they stagger to the door and exit . Susan follows them to the door . Music . Light on Susan smiling. )
