THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment IT 'S the time of year when a num  --  ber of people arc moving to sum  --  mer quarters . The character of our street is different . In the winter , it is usually empty , but now the cafes have their tables out , and there are people around almost all the time . Whole families  --  grandparents , children , and grandchildren  --  sit out in front of their buildings , on the stoops , or on gar  --  bage cans , or on milk crates stood on end . Heavy , pleasant-looking gray-haired women in summer shifts sit on milk L.-rates . Fathers toss babies . Mothers wheel them along in prams , talking to them , keeping their voices low and confidential , so you hear only a word as you pass by no real thread of the discourse . There are lots of children around . They stand on the street below our window and yell for their friends . " Maria ! ... Ma  --  reee-ah ! " they shout , sounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mama wants you home ! " They ride by on bicycles that have radios ( tuned to a disco station ) attached to their handlebars , and shout to the boy lead  --  ing them , " Richie , where you going ? " Richic , who has black hair and is wear  --  ing a white T-shirt and is probably fourteen , says he does n't know . He 's just out for the ride . They play games , running back and forth , but we do n't recognize any of the games as being Capture the Flag , or Hide and Seek , or Ringalevio . The largest number of children gather in the macadam park at the end of the block and light crackers they 've bought on Canal Street . They toss them high into the air and run . Sometimes they set off a string of something like a hundred small firecrackers at a time . These . make bright , popping little flashes , which cause nearby dogs to bark . And sometimes they set off great big ones , one at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air and make you flinch even if you 're ready for them . The old men who wander over to the park from the Bowery , and normally sit at the chess tables and talk , or sleep on the benches , stand now in the far corner by the swings and keep a leery eye on the kids , who sometimes throw firecrackers in their direction , or else they sit in twos and threes in the door  --  ways across the street , sharing cigarettes and a bottle , and waiting for winter , when they can have their park and their peace and quiet hack again . THE June 6th edition of the Times brought the usual collec  --  tion of reports of things that had been going on in the world . Senator Ken  --  nedy , who seems to derive a playful , almost mischievous enjoyment from his all but defeated campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination , had just met with President Carter and told him that he had " every in  --  tention of continuing in this campaign as a candidate , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gates in the primaries to get the nomi  --  nation . Governor Reagan had almost simultaneously met with former Presi  --  dent Ford , who said that he would " wholeheartedly campaign " for Rea  --  gan . Meanwhile , Europe was " Look  --  ing Askance " ( a headline informed us ) at both Mr. Carter and Mr. Rea  --  gan ; and one Francesco Izzo , an " as  --  sistant at Naples University , " was quoted as saying , " There is no choice ; they are both shallow persons . " For  --  mer Secretary of State Vance had giv  --  en an address at Harvard in which he warned against a dangerous " nostal  --  gia " for " earlier days when the world seemed , at least in retrospect , to have been a more orderly place in which American power could , alone , preserve that order . " A bill had been introduced in Congress which would permit pat  --  ents to he taken out on new types of tomatoes , carrots , cucumbers , okra , celery , and peppers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Workers , who had been laid off in December , had said of his fellow unemployed workers , " Their dreams have been shattered . " In New York , Gucci 's had opened a new shop  --  one in which a limited group of customers , who have been supplied with special eighteen  --  carat-gold keys that fit the panel of an elevator leading to the shop , can drink champagne and buy , among other items , a handbag that costs eleven thousand dollars . This year 's summer , or horror , films , including " The Hearse " and " H umanoids from the Deep , " were making their debuts . The stock market and gold were up ; retail sales were down ; and " mostly sunny " weather was predicted for the day . On page 14 , however , there was an item that cast all the rest of the news in a different light . The headline read " Computer Error Falsely Indicates a Soviet Attack , " and the story went on to reveal that for almost three minutes before dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world had been placed on alert : B-52 bomber crews had been sent to their planes ; land-based missiles had gone through the first stages of prepa  --  ration for firing ; ballistic-missile sub  --  marines at sea had been told of the alert ; and at least one plane  --  an elec  --  tronic-control plane in Hawaii  --  had been sent aloft . No one knows whether the Soviets got wind of any of these preparations or whether they made any counter-preparations of their own . Of  --  ficials said that even the American part of the story would not have been made known if it had not been for a leak to the press . On being asked about the possibility that " a series of escalating responses " could have led to what the Times euphemistically called " a con  --  frontation , " Assistant Secretary of De  --  fense Thomas 13 . Ross answered , " I 'm going to duck that question , " using the vernacular to cut a very large ques  --  tion down to size . He reported that neither the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the alert , and said that " we were n't remotely close to World War III . " However , simple mathematics reveals that if you subtract three minutes from the estimated fifteen minutes that it would take the first Soviet missiles to reach our country , you are left with a margin of only twelve minutes be  --  tween business as usual and no business at all twelve minutes in which the President , who we assume would he informed of a possible attack in the fourth minute of an alert , would have to make his awesome decision . Un  --  fortunately , we can never he truly " remote " from so-called World War III until we rid the world of nuclear weapons ; at the time of the mistaken alert , the three minutes that elapsed before a correction was made reduced the tiny margin of safety that we do have by twenty per cent . The story of the false alarm occupied only one column on the " Around the Nation " page of the Times , but in a way it subsumed all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every story in the paper and all future and past stories into itself forever . Two days later , the Times reported  --  this time on page 27 ? that the same com  --  puter had malfunctioned again , caus  --  ing a second three-minute alert . Then it apparently occurred to someone at the Defense Department that this par  --  ticular computer might not be the best one for the job , and , according to a Department spokesman , it was " tak  --  en off the line to absolutely pinpoint the cause and to correct it . " Mean  --  while , people were going on buying and selling , running for office , taking nut patents , going to movies , drinking champagne , and doing all the other things that people do ; but on two oc  --  casions in the space of that one week the steady frame of the world , in which every human action must begin and end , was shaken . ? Temperence Hill , 53-1 Shot , Wins Belmont Stakes ? T FORGOT the horse was in the 1 race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot Temperence Hill was in the race . I looked at my tickets . I did n't have one for Temperence Hill . I could n't believe it . " " I stood in the damn ice-cream line at the refreshment stand for eighteen minutes . I got my chocolate cone . All the windows were closed . That 's the horse I wanted to bet . " " Stop the Music , Temperence Hill 's sire , used to love to run on this track . How could I not think of that ? " " It rains all morning , the track is a swamp , and I neglect to het the only horse wearing mud calks . " " Is it possible that I was so stupid as to bet on Codex just because he won the Preakness ? Codex detests mud . Worst mud horse of all time . " " Why was I so in love with that Mexican horse , that Pikotazo ? I thought that horse was the nuts . " " If I had put two dollars on Temper  --  ence hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight dollars and eighty cents .

It figured that a long-shot horse would he taking it out fast , with nothing to lose . Too bad I bet Bing . " " I was on my way to bet Temper  --  ence Hill , and ran into a guy I met last summer .

" " Remember those guys with those baseball caps with the miniature Viking horns ? Drinking Miller in the picnic bottles ? They were running around chanting Rumbo , Rumba , Rumbo . ' So , like a dip , I went and bet Rumbo . Serves me right . " " I lost seventy-five dollars on Rock hill Native . See ? There it goes my seventy-five dollars , with wings , flying off into the sky . " " I saw Temperence Hill get beat by eleven lengths one time . I did not be  --  lieve that horse could win . " T wo : The " Baseball Diamonds , " edited by Richard Grossinger and Kevin Kerrane , party : The man from one of the city 's daily newspapers walked up to the bar and asked for a drink . He had to ask for it a couple of times before anyone seemed to even notice he was there . When he finally got his drink , he drank it . In one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat straight to the bottom of his stomach , and stayed there  --  at least for a little while . The man from one of the city 's daily newspapers asked For another drink , and after he drank that one he asked for another , and after he drank that one he asked for another . This was one for his stroll around the room . As he strolled around the room . he greeted people , some of whom he knew  --  they were in the daily-news  --  paper business  --  and some of whom he was meeting for the first time . Clear  --  ly , he was glad to be in this room , glad to be with these people , glad to have a drink in his hand , glad to he alive . A woman came up to him and said , " Hi , I like your great writing , " and the combination of the drinks and the woman 's saying such a thing to him made his face turn red with pleasure . He beamed at her , and she , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he shook his head and shaped his eyes into a playful squint . The words " Well , well " formed on his lips , and he put his free hand on his nape , perhaps re  --  minding himself that he was , after all , a man from one of the city 's dailies . He said out loud to himself , " I better call my wife . " His clear blue eyes suddenly clouded over . He said , " I better get out of here . " He looked up . His eyes met those of another woman . She wore a black dress , a white apron , and a little white cap . She was one of the waitresses hired specially for this party . He looked at her , his eyes plead  --  ing . She looked hack at him , and in looking so closely and deeply at him she knew everything about him there was to know at that moment . She brought him a fresh drink . Punk-and-Dagger POSITIVELY the last quiz question of the week : Q  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , FBI , IRS , and The Police ? A  --  Miles Copeland II , a former Central Intelligence Agency official and the author of " The Real Spy World " and " The Game of Nations , " has three sons : Miles III , who operates IRS , a London-based record company that produces and manages thirty-five New Wave hands ; Stewart , who is the drummer of the highly successful New Wave hand called The Police ( and named " Best New Artist " in Rolling Stone 's 1979 Critics ' Poll ) ; and Ian , who is the president of FBI ( Frontier Booking International ) , a New York company that hooks N.W. hands in the U.S. , including The Police , Squeeze , Iggy Pop , The Specials , John Cale , Buzzcocks , The Cramps , Chel  --  sea , Skafish , The Split Enz , 999 , XTC , Gang of Four , and Robin Lane &; the Charthusters . We decided last week to run a check on the operations of Ian , so , on the basis of a tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifty-seventh Street . The JUNE 2 3 , 1 9 8 0 floor directory listed the National Mah  --  jongg League , Inc. ( 613 ) , the Snar Construction- Co. , Inc. ( 615 ) , the Success Research Institute ( 618 ) , and other firms that sounded like fronts for something , but there was no FBI . Room 603 ? Spy Records , Ltd. ; Cheap &; Nasty Products , Inc. ; Jam-rag Music , Ltd. ? looked like a good bet , so we went in there . It turned out that we had guessed right . A slim , good-looking young woman in black jeans and a black shirt who was play  --  ing a noisy Kiss pinball machine not only confirmed that this was FBI headquarters but divulged that FBI shared the office with Spy Records , etc . Presently , Ian Copeland , a tall , lanky , un-punk , and outgoing young man in a green T-shirt , jeans , and sandals , emerged from his office and invited us in . The office was decorated with framed platinum records ( meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large chart displaying the tour dates of various bands . On a side table sat a copy of " The Real Spy World , " by Miles Copeland II . " When I was a kid , " said Ian Cope  --  land , sitting down at his desk , " I never knew exactly what my father did for a living , I just knew we travelled a lot . I was born in Damascus , and lived in Washington , D.C. , England , Egypt , and Lebanon besides Syria . I remem ber standing on the beach in Lebanon in 1958 surrounded by Arab Chiclets-sellers and watching the Ma  --  rines come ashore . That was when I was eight . When I got to he a teen-ager and started going out on dates , the girl 's par  --  ents would say , ' And what does your father do ? ' I 'd say I did n't know . Then I 'd go home and ask him , and he 'd say , ' Who wants to know ? ' " At that time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd come home to Beirut every three months , look at my report card with disgust , tell me to get my long hair cut , and fly back to Cairo , leav  --  ing my older brother Miles in charge . I re  --  sented that . So when I was fifteen I ran away from home . I got on my BSA 650 motor THE NEW YORKER cycle and went to the Armenian sec  --  tion of Beirut to hide out . There was a small bridge that led over there , and the Beirut police were n't allowed to cross it . I was very proud of successful  --  ly evading my father . He found me after a few weeks , however , and he said if I wanted to run away from home Beirut was not the place to do it . He told me he worked for the C.I.A . and I was too easy a target . So he gave me money to go to England , and let me run away there . " After a grim winter on a British construction crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , serving in Vietnam , and on his return to England he started booking main  --  stream rock hands , including The Climax Blues Band , Wishbone Ash , fell Beck , The Average White Band , and Renaissance . " But after a few years music began to bore , " he said . " The bigness of it all was a joke . You had to sound like Led Zeppelin plus Fleetwood Mac , and every band had to have fifteen roadies . After recording , somebody would say , ' The sound is not crisp enough , ' so the band would go hack into the studio and spend an  --  other thirty thousand dollars . Then the punk scene started . I felt born again ! Each band had something new to say . The music industry resisted the experts agreed that it would n't work in America  --  but it spread like a revolution . Stewart was forming The Police , and Miles was record  --  ing and booking , and I got right intn it . " Our father had directed us toward music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jazz trumpeter , and had played with Glenn Miller . By the time I was born , in 1950 , he had lost his lip , but he played piano all the time , and there were always Stan Kenton records playing in the house . My father is a perfectionist . When Stewart was a kid just starting on the drums , he could immediately do dazzling things But my father worried that Stewart could n't keep time . He kept telling Stewart , ' That 's the most important thing for a drummer  --  keeping the beat . ' " My mother is an archeologist . She spends a lot of time at a mountain dig in Syria . She 's written some books about prehistoric man and about flints they 've found in Lebanon . When we were kids in Egypt , every Sunday we 'd go on a picnic to a different pyramid or ancient temple . It was like going to church . Our family photograph albums are full of us standing in front of some enormous ruin in the middle of the desert -- something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Cru  --  saders , had left behind . A few weeks ago , I went hack to Egypt to see The Police play . We arrived on Fridav for a Saturday concert , but we 'd forgotten that Friday in Egypt is like Sunday here . Everything was closed , including Customs , and all the hand 's gear was locked up until Monday . Miles called Dad in Washington , and Dad gave him the name of a guy to get in touch with . The next thing we knew , Mrs. Sadat had personally authorized Cus  --  toms to open up , and the concert went on as scheduled . " n An amiable-looking New Waver in dark glasses appeared in the doorway , and Copeland greeted him and asked , " Just fly in ? " " Yes , " said the young man . " Jet lag ? " Copeland inquired . " Not yet , " the man said , in a Brit  --  ish accent . He headed for the pinball machine . " When did your father retire from the C.I.A. ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he replied . " He became a business consultant in Wash  --  ington . " Then he smiled . " At least , that 's what he says . "
