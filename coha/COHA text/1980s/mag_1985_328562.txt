Huddled together in a few low-rent blocks of lower Manhattan , a remarkable band of visual artists , theatrical innovators , dancers and composers , loosely allied in their rejection of both traditionalism and a previous generation 's idea of radicalism , supported and inspired one another in what was then a lonely pursuit . " The collaborative element of those years was crucial , " remembers Composer Philip Glass . " I mean , you 'd walk down the street and run into Lucinda Childs or Bob Wilson , Laurie Anderson , Merce Cunningham or John Cage . It was like people say Paris was in the ' 20s . " <P> Adventuresome audiences that had made the pilgrimage downtown to Leo Castelli 's influential art gallery on West Broadway in SoHo , for example , might encounter minimalist sculpture by Don Judd and Richard Serra or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Performance Artist Anderson was playing her violin on a street corner while wearing ice skates atop a melting block of ice . Composer Steve Reich had already experimented with out-of-sync tape loops in pieces like Come Out ; Choreographer Childs had created her early works , like Street Dance . " No one organized an official group or issued a manifesto , as would have occurred in Europe , " says John Howell , a New York % journalist who was part of the scene . " Instead , it was just wham .

Many found it initially difficult to come to terms with the avant-garde 's startling modernist images , such as Stalin 's dance for 19 ostriches or its chorus line of caricatured black mammies swaying to the strains of On the Beautiful Blue Danube . But those who did , witnessed the foundation of much of the art of the ' 80s . <P> Eventually the downtown scene burnt itself out in a blaze of success . Rampant gentrification has made SoHo 's once funky lofts affordable only to the moneyed , and its former have-not inhabitants have also become chic . Anderson has forsaken the streets for major concert halls like the Brooklyn Academy , where in 1983 she performed her six-hour multimedia epic , United States , Parts I-IV . Wilson directed Marc-Antoine Charpentier 's baroque opera Medee last fall in France ; Reich 's music has been performed by major orchestras from San Francisco to Cologne . The next extraordinary concentration of creative artists is now probably taking shape .
