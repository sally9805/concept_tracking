" Kim Dae Jung ! Kim Dae Jung ! " That cry greeted South Korea 's best-known opposition leader last week as he visited his native Cholla region for the first time in 16 years . Though Kim , 63 , called the trip a " sentimental journey of the heart , " the adulation he met transformed the three-day tour into a political triumph . It also raised anew a hot question : Would Kim break a vow not to run for office and seek to become a candidate in December , when South Korea holds its first democratic presidential elections since 1971 ? <P> Kim certainly acted like a man on the hustings . His voice cracking with emotion , he delivered a fiery address in a cemetery in Kwangju , where at least 191 people died in a 1980 uprising against South Korea 's military rulers . Hundreds of thousands of onlookers then surged into the street behind Kim 's car and followed it to Kwangju 's main square , where Kim promised higher wages for workers and better crop prices for farmers . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprisoned and sentenced to death , Kim declared that the " trip far exceeded my expectations . " But he said he plans to make more tours before deciding whether to run . An adviser to the Reunification Democratic Party , Kim remains wary of challenging Kim Young Sam , 59 , the party 's president . Neither man wants to split the opposition vote in the race against Roh Tae Woo , the candidate of the ruling Democratic Justice Party . While Kim may finally settle for the role of elder statesman , the cheers in Kwangju last week would make any politician think twice .
