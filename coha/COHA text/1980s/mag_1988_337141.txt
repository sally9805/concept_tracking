Ever since the time of Aristotle , scientists have been puzzled by exactly what determines whether a baby is a boy or a girl . Last week the ancient mystery appeared to have been unlocked . A nine-member team led by a geneticist at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge , Mass. , announced that an infant 's sex seems to be fixed by a single gene called testis determining factor , or TDF . The discovery , declared Whitehead 's director , Nobel Laureate David Baltimore , was the result of a " landmark set of experiments . " <P> In the seventh week of embryonic growth , reported Chief Researcher David Page , the presence of the TDF gene appears to launch a process that leads to male sexual development ; without it , the fetus will be female . The scientists , whose findings appear in the Dec. 24 issue of the journal Cell , caution that the evidence is still circumstantial , and the discovery will have no immediate application . Even so , says UCLA Geneticist Larry Shapiro , " they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of biology . We have a long way to go , but this is certainly a major step along the way . " <P> Aristotle theorized that the father 's degree of arousal during intercourse determined the offspring 's sex ; great excitement , he reasoned , produced a boy . In the 1920s , scientists confirmed the existence of human sex chromosomes , two of the 46 chromosomes people normally carry . Ordinarily , women have two X chromosomes , whereas men have an X and a Y. In 1959 the sex determining factor was traced to the Y chromosome . But it was still unclear whether the " switch " consisted of one gene or many . <P> To find out how sexual differentiation works , Page and his team decided in 1981 to study the sex chromosomes of people who are genetically abnormal : men with two X chromosomes and women with an X and a Y. Despite the genetic reversal , the XX men and XY women , although infertile , appeared normal . The scientists showed that one X chromosome in these men always had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y chromosomes always lacked that same tiny bit . The TDF gene , they figured , must be contained in that fragment , which sometimes breaks off from the Y. <P> Finding the suspect gene took 18 months of painstaking analysis . It was , Page says , " like seeing a brick wall and piecing it together brick by brick . " After pinpointing the TDF gene , Page used computer analysis to hypothesize how it works . The suspicion is that TDF triggers the production of a protein that signals other genes to induce maleness . <P> " Perhaps the most important result of this research , " says Peter Goodfellow , of London 's Imperial Cancer Research Fund , whose lab had predicted the gene 's location , " is that it could provide a model system for development in general . " Explains UCLA 's Shapiro : " It 's not just a question of triggering the growth of gonads . It 's how a cell decides whether it becomes a muscle cell or a skin cell . " <P> To confirm their findings , the researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouse egg will transform a female embryo into a male . If so , Goodfellow says , this knowledge may eventually enable researchers to predict and " program " sex ratios in livestock . But for now , talk about future applications pales next to the excitement of the discovery .
