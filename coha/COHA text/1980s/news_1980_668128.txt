Baseball ' s best hitter , George Brett , won a duel with baseball ' s best reliever , Rich Gossage , last night , and as a result the Kansas City Royals are on the way to their first World Series . Brett tagged Gossage for a three-run homer in the seventh inning , lifting the Royals to a comeback 4-2 victory over the New York Yankees that gave them a three-game sweep of the American League championship series . In winning their first pennant ever - and avenging three previous losses to the Yankees in these series - the Royals and their ace reliever , Dan Quisenberry , had to survive a bases-loaded Yankee threat in the eighth inning . One step from the offseason , Phineas T. Bluster , alias George Steinbrenner , tried to pull anything he could . He met with Dick Howser and his coaches ( yes , Mike Ferraro ' s fingers are still there ) . He helped organize a chapel service ( " George is trying to sign God as a free agent , " laughed one player ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to throw out the first ball . However , he didn ' t have enough divine guidance to keep the rains away . While Tommy John and Paul Splittorff were hooked up in a dual shutout in the fourth , umpire chief Bill Haller stopped the game . The Royals had two out , Hal McRae on first and Willie Mays Aikens at the plate in the top of the inning when the rain began coming down hard . In that time , each pitcher had had to work out of minor trouble . The rain delay lasted 32 minutes , and when John got around to pitching , Willie Mays Aikens ripped his first pitch off the glove of the leaping Bob Watson for a single . Darrell Porter just missed a double down the right-field line , and Howser had Tom Underwood and Ron Davis warming up when John went to 3-and-2 on the Royal catcher . But Porter flied to Lou Piniella to end the inning . Splittorff came back from the rain with a 1-2-3 bottom of the fourth . It was the second baseman no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . White , who battled from 0-and-2 to get a hit preceding Willie Wilson ' s triple in Game 2 and was 5 for 7 in the first two games , lined a home run down the left field in the fifth for Kansas City ' s 1-0 lead . To show how much both managers were trying to play Fischer-Spassky , Howser again got Davis and Underwood up after the homer , and when Splittorf walked Willie Randolph with two out in the bottom of the fifth , Jim Frey started Renie Martin and Ken Brett warming up in case Splittorf began fading . Dent flied out to Amos Otis . Martin and Brett sat back down . But when White had to leap to make a superb stab of Watson ' s liner leading off the bottom of the sixth and Jackson went out and lined a double over Brett ' s head , Frey brought in his ace , Dan Quisenberry . It was an unusal move , it being only the sixth inning . It also did not work . Oscar Gamble batted for Eric Soderholm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fabulous stab , but tried throwing to third , hoping to catch Jackson rounding the bag . But his off- balance throw sailed over Brett ' s head and caromed off the auxiliary boxes at the end of the Royals ' dugout . As Brett tried to pick it up and keep from falling down the steps , he accidentally knocked the ball into the dugout , which , when everyone stopped moving in counterclockwise circles , put Gamble at third . Cerone lined a single into left-center , the Yankees had a 2-1 lead and Gossage , who hadn ' t even gotten into the first two games , was up throwing in the bullpen in the seventh . As the seventh inning progressed , Frey was having his batboy grab balls and stuffing them in his coat pocket - five of them - as he screamed at umpire Larry McCory about John cutting up the balls . Nothing came of his protestsbecause when Wilson doubled into the right-field corner with two out , Howser brought in Gossage . And the best player in baseball crushed the best reliever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he chopped a bouncer over the mound , he simply outran Randolph ' s throw . First and third . Next pitch : Brett ' s towering shot landed in the second row of the third deck , the sixth home run he ' s hit in four playoffs , which ties Steve Garvey ' s record . 4-2 Royals .
