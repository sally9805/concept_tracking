To residents of Greenwich Village , Grace Paley is the friendly neighborhood radical . Every sunny Saturday afternoon this year the diminutive grandmother has been on duty at the busy intersection of Sixth Avenue and Eleventh Street , buttonholing passersby on behalf of the Women 's Pentagon Action . " Would you like to sign a petition against U.S. military intervention in Central America ? " she asks . For the 37 years she has lived in the Village , Paley , 62 , has engaged in countless curbside solicitations as well as rallies , demonstrations and sit-ins . Her causes have been as local as keeping traffic out of Washington Square Park and as global as U.S. nuclear policy . <P> But outside the Village , Paley has an entirely different reputation . Her first book of short stories , The Little Disturbances of Man ( 1959 ) , was lavishly praised by critics and by colleagues as disparate as Philip Roth , Donald Barthelme and Susan Sontag  --  but not for the book 's political messages . In fact , the tales were devoid of exhortation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering . Her second book , Enormous Changes at the Last Minute ( 1974 ) , also evoked the anguish of women caught in what she called " the courts of kitchen drama . " Wives were abandoned , mothers were overburdened by cherished babies , and grown children grieved for their parents fading away in institutions for the elderly . <P> In her third volume , Later the Same Day , the heroines have aged a few years . But the familial tragedies are much the same , and they are still leavened by the author 's lively erotic imagination and her invincible ironies . Although Paley continues to skirt the political confrontations she elicits in life , her writing ministers to the walking wounded from the ' 60s . In " Friends , " three women gather at the bedside of a dying companion . All have yet another cause for sorrow : a daughter found dead in a faraway rooming house . A boy vanished into California : " a son , a boy of fifteen , who disappears before your very eyes into a darkness or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitting can bring him . " <P> Some of the fierce vitality of the sexual encounters in Paley 's earlier stories have given way to more nostalgic couplings . In " Listening , " a middle-aged woman driving south on Broadway sees a pedestrian whose " nice unimportant clothes seemed to be merely a shelter for the naked male person . " She thinks , " Oh , man , in the very center of your life , still fitting your skin so nicely . . . why have you slipped out of my sentimental and carnal grasp ? " Turning to a woman friend in the car , she says : " He 's nice , is n't he ? " The reply is vintage Paley : " I suppose so . . . but what is he , just a bourgeois on his way home . "
