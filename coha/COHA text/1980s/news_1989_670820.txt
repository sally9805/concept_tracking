Speaking through microphones to several hundred parishioners in the Roman Catholic parish ' s modern church , Father Fermeglia gravely compared the 16-year-old victim , Yusef Hawkins , to Jesus Christ - " another innocent man who was misunderstood " - and deplored a wave of violence that in the last year has taken the lives of two young men from the parish. // " Sometimes , " said the 30-year-old associate pastor , who has worked closely with young people in the neighborhood , " our religion does not reflect the way we live. " // As the tragedy of Mr. Hawkins ' s death plays itself out in a city already damaged by crimes with racial overtones , Bensonhurst ' s largely Italian-American community is caught in conflicting emotions . While many residents express grief and shame over Mr. Hawkins ' s senseless death , others - resentful of the ugly picture they see being painted of their neighborhood - have dug themselves in deeper , flaunting a racism so blunt that it shocks even veterans of the civil rights movement in Mississippi. // It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially closed community like Bensonhurst - where change comes slowly , and is not particularly welcome , and where a fierce vigilance over territory has sometimes slipped into vigilantism . Even within the neighborhood , Father Fermeglia described how turf is carefully divided among the Bay 50th , the 69th Street , the 20th Avenue and the 18th Avenue " boys , " each operating within set boundaries. // " This is a very provincial community , " Father Fermeglia said in an interview after the service . " A lot of these kids don ' t know what life is outside Bensonhurst . Heck , some of the boys on 20th Avenue don ' t even know what life is like on 13th Avenue. " // This insularity has exacerbated people ' s fears , and their angers too , Father Fermeglia said . " When something like this happens in a neighborhood , the community draws in , " he said. // On Saturday , Bensonhurst ' s defensiveness took an ugly turn when groups of young white men stood on 20th Avenue , jeering and taunting black demonstrators as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s killing . <> <> Tears in Their Eyes // Yet , yesterday on the same street , several parishioners came up to Father Fermeglia , with tears in their eyes . " A child died , and a mother is in pain , " said Carmella Collandria , herself a mother of three , as she fought back her own emotions . " That ' s the way I feel ; that ' s the way my neighbors feel . The press has been talking to the wrong people. " // Yesterday , tempers flared again as taunts were yelled by some Bensonhurst residents at marchers in another angry demonstration. // As a neighborhood , Bensonhurst , perched on Brooklyn ' s southern shore , is in many ways an anomaly : unlike in many other parts of New York City , little has changed in Bensonhurst in the last decade , perhaps even since " The Honeymooners , " the Jackie Gleason television comedy , was set there in the 1950 ' s. // More than 60 percent of the people still live in the one- or two-family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually brightened by pots of geraniums or petunias , often adorned by religious statues . In the evenings , families and neighbors set out lawn chairs on the sidewalks for leisurely end-of-the-day conversations. // " This is a very stable community , " said Howard Feuer , district manager of Brooklyn ' s Community Board 11 . " It is not uncommon for people to have lived here all their lives , for their parents to have lived here before them . These are people who are happy in their community . " <> <> ' The Biggest Problem ' // In an election year with many neighborhoods clamoring for more services , more police officers and more attention from City Hall , Bensonhurst has few complaints , Mr. Feuer said . " The biggest problem is the subways , " he said . " They don ' t run on time. " // Instead of local complaints , there are symbolic issues , most of which have to do with people ' s fear of crime . But even that issue is more of an abstraction in Bensonhurst than elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Mr. Feuer says the levels have recently stabilized. // Still , crime is the key this year to most people ' s political preferences , usually decided on the basis of how " soft " or how " tough " a candidate is perceived . Interviews with about three dozen Bensonhurst residents showed that , as expected , the neighborhood is divided between Mayor Edward I. Koch , now running for the Democratic nomination , and Rudolph W. Giuliani , a candidate for the Republican mayoral nomination. // Some said they were drawn to Mr. Koch in spite of themselves . " I hate to vote for him , " said one registered Republican , " but no one else can come close to him on experience. " // Mr. Giuliani ' s reputation as a " tough " prosecutor stands him in good stead in Bensonhurst , but many of those interviewed conceded that there was another reason . " I guess it is his last name , " said Gary Marmo , a 29-year-old masonry worker who is a registered Republican . <> <> Little Support for Dinkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female , there was little support shown in Bensonhurst for the candidacy of David N. Dinkins , the Manhattan Borough President running in the Democratic mayoral primary and the only major black candidate in the primary this year . In discussing Mr. Dinkins , several voters were frank about their reluctance to see a black mayor in New York City . Some said it was because they were not impressed by the performance of black mayors in other cities , while others said they believed that a black mayor would be " too soft on crime " and discriminate against whites. // " I can ' t see how a black mayor can not favor his people , " said Maria Pucci , who has lived in Bensonhurst for 31 years . " I think whites are becoming a minority in this city. " // Proud that their community had stayed intact in recent years , some Bensonhurst residents expressed concern that it might change and lose its identity . " I think the white areas of the city are taken for granted , " said one young man , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are already being pushed back farther and farther . Sometimes I think the next stop is a boat . " <> <> Earlier Incidents // In recent years , Bensonhurst has earned a reputation for a lack of tolerance for nonwhite minorities . In 1983 , three black men on their way home from work at Coney Island Hospital were beaten by a group of whites at the corner of Bay 53d Street and Cropsey Avenue ; in 1987 , two black men were chased by a group of whites and beaten on 24th Street , and that same year , leaflets were distributed in Bensonhurst , warning of a conspiracy by local real-estate agents to sell homes to a growing Asian population. // Since that last incident , Mr. Feuer said Bensonhurst has improved relations with its Asian-American residents and business owners . " They used to be a quiet little community on the side , " he said . " Now they are very involved. " // Bensonhurst has a sizable Jewish population , but Mr. Feuer said the proportion of Italian-Americans has increased in recent years . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Community Board 11 ' s 152 , 700 in population , of which Bensonhurst makes up 80 percent. // As new waves of immigrants arrive , the community ' s cultural continuity has been reinforced . Father Fermeglia said that at St. Dominic ' s , where priests are required to know Italian , more than half of the parishioners were born in Italy . After the 10 : 30 A.M. Mass in Italian in the church , 20th Avenue filled up yesterday with elderly couples , men in hats and women in black dresses , who greeted each other with " buon giorno , " rather than " good morning. " // Bensonhurst still lives in a web of traditions and rituals , many of them directly transplanted from Italy . Social clubs , linked to geographic regions of Italy , play a vital role in sponsoring a wide range of events and activities , including the Feast of Santa Rosalia this week . Federal prosecutors say the Mafia also has a strong presence in the community , although most people are reluctant to mention its activities. // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Fermeglia said he heard were " killed by the mob. " // Father Fermeglia , who was ordained only a year ago , knew most of the defendants involved in the Hawkins case , including Joseph Fama , the 18-year-old still being sought by the police . Father Fermeglia said Mr. Fama ' s parents had emigrated from Italy and spoke only Italian at home . He said the young man had a history of " violent actions . " <> <> ' Type of Kid Who Snaps ' // " He was the type of kid who snaps , " Father Fermeglia said . " I don ' t think it was bravado . " Also , he said , Mr. Fama was not a regular member of the 69th Street group , the one that had been lying in wait for black and Hispanic youths the night Mr. Hawkins was killed . Father Fermeglia said the youth belonged to a group that hangs out on 18th Avenue. // These nuances were new to Father Fermeglia , who came to Bensonhurst from Whitestone , Queens , but he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bensonhurst , the nuances are what define life . " Everyone knows each other , " he said . " People get the meaning of their lives from their relationships. " // In the days since Yusef Hawkins was slain , Father Fermeglia has listened as his parishioners talked . He said many at first denied that racism was even a factor in Mr. Hawkins ' s death ; he had to disagree . " I would never deny that there is racism in Bensonhurst , " he said . " It is there . " <> <> A Widening Gulf // He has also watched as the murder has widened the gulf between whites and blacks , making it increasingly difficult for either side to make even simple gestures to re-establish trust . He said no one from Bensonhurst joined in the Saturday march because they were not invited and because of widespread dislike of the Rev. Al Sharpton , one of the protest leaders. // Tomorrow , clergy members from Bensonhurst are preparing a prayer service in memory of Mr. Hawkins , which may be held with clergy from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , Mr. Fama ' s disappearance continues to worry the community . " I hope he gives himself in , " the priest said . " I am afraid of suicide. " // Besides , he added , until the murder suspect is found , the cloud over Bensonhurst can not be lifted . " Once he gives himself up , then we can start picking up the pieces , " he said. //
