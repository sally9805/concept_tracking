While the stock market has drifted aimlessly for the past 18 months , the growth of newsletters that offer investment advice has been almost straight up . Since 1970 , the number of tip sheets devoted to picking everything from stocks to crops has doubled , to more than 700 . That rapid growth has caught the eye of the Securities and Exchange Commission , which has been cracking down on fraud within the financial newsletter industry . The agency has hauled six market-advice publishers into court since 1981 on such charges as making false advertising claims and has launched administrative actions against a dozen more . <P> Now the SEC 's power to regulate newsletters is being challenged in a widely watched Supreme Court case . In opening arguments before the high court last week , Michael Schoeman , attorney for Publisher Christopher L. Lowe , declared that the SEC violated Lowe 's constitutional right to freedom of speech when it sought to bar him from publishing market tips . The agency revoked Lowe 's investment adviser license in 1981 after the Jersey City man was convicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client and failing to register as an investment adviser in New York State . Said Schoeman prior to appearing before the Supreme Court : " We 're not challenging the revocation of the license . We 're saying you do n't need a license to publish a newsletter . Freedom of the press , if it means nothing else , means the right to publish free of licensing . " <P> Other market advisers are rallying around Lowe , who has continued to issue his 5,000-subscriber Lowe Investment &; Financial Letter , a tip sheet that sells for $195 a year . They note that newspapers and magazines do not have to be licensed . Said Norman Fosback , president of the Florida-based Institute for Econometric Research , which produces five investment letters with 60,000 subscribers : " Hopefully , the Supreme Court will now rule once and for all that the First Amendment applies equally to every American . " Support also has come from such newspapers as the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal , which have denounced the registration requirement . <P> The SEC , meanwhile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Investment Advisers Act of 1940 , which says that the agency should register newsletter publishers and monitor their activities . Said John Fedders , the SEC 's enforcement director : " Courts of appeals have held uniformly that requiring the registration of persons who furnish investment advice through newsletters is consistent with the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of ( speech and the press . " If the SEC prevails in the case , Fedders said , critics should ask Congress to change the law .
