California friends Patti Davis and Jane Fonda were surprised to find each other recently on ABC ' s " Good Morning America " , looking like twins in pants and bright printed shirts . " You guys are starting to look alike and sound alike , " joked Fonda ' s husband Tom Hayden . " But don ' t print that , " Patti said later . " There ' s no comparison . She ' s more beautiful than ever . " This President ' s daughter is still more self-deprecating and hesitant than she is vain or impressed with her position . And coming of age as she did - in the public eye , caught between the very traditional world of her mother and the counter-culture California of her own generation - she is still finding her image changing . Photos through the ' 70s show a succession of Pattis . In her hotel room after her TV appearance , after she had changed into an Emmanuelle Khanh embroidered blouse and scalloped gauze skirt , she was warmer than she appeared to be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articulate than press stories have painted her . Like her mother , she is both wary of the press and then quite open to conversation . The only actor left in the Reagan family was in town to talk about work . She recently finished shooting her first big part , an NBC tele-movie , " For Ladies Only " in which she plays a talent agent ' s assistant who takes a personal interest in a male stripper . Carrying this role into real life , actor Greg Harrison actually took it all off at a cast party that wound up the shooting in Atlantic City a couple of weeks ago . The story turned up in headlines , as her luck would have it , to coincide with Patti ' s New York visit . The President ' s daughter wouldn ' t comment on Harrison : " I heard about it , but I wasn ' t there , and I ' m not going to make a comment on what someone else does , " she said . " Well , I wouldn ' t do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the kind of event and image that seem to dog Patti : hardly what Mom had in mind for her first-born . Instead , Nancy must live with Patti ' s failure to finish college , her live-in relationship with a rock star , her No Nukes rallying , her nifty thrifty fashion style , her ambitions . Unlike her love-and-marriage mother at the same age , Patti is hardly looking for the right man and a family . She would like to marry " eventually , for nice companionship , " but no way does she consider giving up her career for a baby as her mother did for baby Patti . Instead , she says , she might adopt children over the age of 2 ; not only are there " so many kids who need homes " but , she thinks , perhaps naively , they would be " old enough so you can take them along to the set with you . " But that ' s for later . Right now all the President ' s daughter wants is " more and more work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce Springsteen and Joni Mitchell , and she hopes both to make albums and to move on to acting in feature films , although she fears the latter is " quite a jump . " Not as much of a jump as your father made , a visitor suggests , and she smiles and says she hopes to be working past 65 , too . Pictured in the press as something of a California flake , Patti is a perfectly reasonable figure from the America that eats health foods and plays rock music . She wears only a little eye makeup and has substituted sunblock for burning herself dark brown . She has a hair cutter , Dusty Fleming , and goes to a clinic for organic facials . And she " is not very good in long dresses . " She took three steps in her red Dior Inaugural gown and ripped the hem . " I take big steps and I can ' t wear high heels . " She giggles . " A friend calls them low I.Q. shoes . " As a matter of fact she found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although she describes herself as " not fashion-minded , " she had said on the phone , " Let ' s talk about fashion , " meaning no nukes , no gun control , no abortion , no ERA , the issues on which she disagrees with her father . But what we really talked about was her feelings . For Patti , even clothes have to do with how they feel rather than how they look . She likes only clothes that are " real loose , that I can move in . If something doesn ' t feel right , it doesn ' t matter if people tell you it looks good . It colors how you feel about yourself and the whole day can be ruined . " She pegs herself as " still basically a tomboy . " Flipping her blouse collar , she notes , " This much ruffle is about it for me . My mother can wear ruffles . She can carry it off . " Patti usually wears pants but has recently made a connection with Emmanuelle Khanh , the French designer whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat intellectual and eccentric women ' s clothes . " I ' m addicted to her glasses , " Patti says , and their shape does cut her round cheeks , which tend to photograph chipmunk-like . To a basically antique clothes wardrobe Davis has added longish Khanh skirts in wool and gauze , some trousers , a thin camel coat and delicate blouses . She finds Khanh clothes " just right for me " because she can take the outfits apart , putting a delicate embroidered blouse with bermuda shorts or cowboy boots with the gauze skirts to make them " funky looking . " " I dress like I make salads , " she jokes . " I put everything in it , thrown together . " She could never go to Adolfo , for instance , and get a packaged deal . Instead she buys pieces and then says , " Hey , that goes with this . " Even as a little girl she didn ' t understand her mother ' s way of shopping , going out for a day to buy clothes for school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can ' t even decide what size I am , " she shrugs her shoulders helplessly . " Going shopping in department stores gives me anxiety attacks . I feel like I ' m going to faint . I get nauseous . I forget what I want the minute I come in the door , but I feel I should buy something . I immediately buy the wrong thing and have to go back later and exchange it . " This Reagan is wonderful at expressing her feelings . She paints a vivid picture of herself in her West Coast apartment just after the assassination attempt . " I would cry and then stop crying and then want to do something normal like make coffee to make the world normal again . My little dog kept bouncing a ball in front of me . I could see that he wanted to play . And that seemed normal , but the sun was still shining . I felt that the clouds should come over the sky and everything should change .

In Canada they never printed Chapman ' s name ( Mark David Chapman , alleged killer of John Lennon ) . My acting teacher Mary Carver told me there ' s an old Greek saying , If you want to go down in history , kill a king . ' It ' s true . I don ' t know who was in Lincoln ' s cabinet but I sure know John Wilkes Booth ' s name . " Another way to go down in history is to be in the President ' s family . It will be interesting to see how she does and exactly what her historical image turns out to be .
