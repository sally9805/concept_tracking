Much of the $40 billion spent each year on home improvements goes for " unneeded , defective or exhorbitantly priced products , " the nation ' s largest consumer group said today . " A strong case can be made that home improvement abuses are more in need of remedy than any other type of consumer fraud , " the Consumer Federation of America said in the study , done under contract with the Department of Housing and Urban Development . Home repairs are second to automobiles as the largest source of consumer complaints , it said . " But in dollar terms , home improvement frauds are far more costly . They typically involve more than $1000 and at times , tens of thousands of dollars , " The consumer group said such problems have received little attention and called for a federal investigation to find out more precisely how much is lost through fraud . It recommended that home improvement firms be required to post bonds , have insurance or put payments in escrow to make sure that operators don ' t take a customer ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disturbingly , the problems appear to be growing worse , " the consumer group said . Some of the practices discussed in the study were : - Lien sales contracts . Contractors write into sales contracts a fine- print provision for a lien on the house . If payments are missed , the holder of the lien can foreclose on the property . Especially in California , this has led to foreclosures on homes in which consumers had built up thousands ofdollars in equity . The consumer group called lien sales contracts " a prime candidate for the distinction of being the worst consumer rip-off of the last 30 years . " - Basement waterproofing by the soil injection method , which involves pumping clay or a chemical into the ground under pressure , allegedly sealing the walls against water leakage . " Few experts will say flatly that the method never works , but nearly all agree that it is highly unreliable , " the report said . - Roofing repairs . " Poor workmanship in roofing repairs is evident when the roof continues to leak or , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , " it said . - Solar heaters , where tax credits can be used to get extra money from home owners . In one such scheme , a contractor sells a $3000 system for an artificially high price of $4000 as a device for boosting the tax credit . He says he will throw in a $1000 monitoring system for free . But the monitoring system may not be worth and may not be needed , the report said . " Most jurisdictions do not regulate firms until complaints are received . Moreover , businessmen in this area are freer than most to avoid sanctions by moving operations to a different city or state , or by declaring bankruptcy and reincorporating under a different name , " the consumer group said . Those most often defrauded are such vulnerable groups as low- income people , recent widows and immigrants who haven ' t mastered English , the study said . " Dishonest and incompetent contractors often defraud people on fixed incomes of their entire savings and leave their only major asset , their house , in shambles , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
