" We should never be so concerned about anything that we stop caring for each other , " Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young declared last week . That pastoral attitude , says Young , was the reason for his March 25 telephone call to the estranged wife of his friend and political colleague Julian Bond , cautioning her about allegations of cocaine use she was making to the police .
