The resignation from Abbott Laboratories last week of its third president and chief operating officer in 10 years puzzles analysts , but some said Monday they were unworried about the company ' s prospects . The departure of Jack W. Schuler culminates recurring conflict resulting from the unwillingness of the company ' s chairman and chief executive oficer , Robert A. Schoellhorn , to have a powerful prince close to the throne , say sources close to the company . While Abbott has solidified its dominance of some market niches and thrown off consistently stellar earnings , Schoellhorn , 61 , has almost as consistently made it clear to strong and competent seconds-in-command that their presence is not desired , these sources say . If true , it may have led to human sufferings but not to corporate ones , say analysts . Schuler ' s resignation " does not change my view of the company ' s prospects , " said Kenneth Abramowitz , a health care analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein . " It ' s just too bad to see excellent companies lose talented people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The company acknowledged " philosophical differences " between Schoellhorn and Schuler , " but we don ' t know the exact nature of those differences , " said Abramowitz . Speculation that Schoellhorn forced the resignation in order to avoid having to leave the company at the mandatory retirement age is " probably untrue , " says Abramowitz . " It ' s every chairman ' s responsibility to have succession plans , and large companies have provisions like this for very important reasons . I don ' t think that ' s the issue . " Schoellhorn has said publicly that he will retire in 1993 when he reaches age 65 . The resignation of Schuler may help pave the way for the top job to go eventually to Duane Burnham , the company ' s vice chairman and chief financial officer , said Jerry Fuller , vice president of Duff &; Phelps Inc . At the time that Schuler was named president and chief operating officer in 1987 , Burnham was named chief financial officer and to the newly created post of vice chairman . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Schoellhorn would let these two guys fight it out and whoever emerges would be CEO , " said Fuller . " The company said at the time that these guys weren ' t being pitted against each other , that they had two very important parts of the organization to run . " Still , Burnham ' s succession is " not a done deal , " said Fuller . " We ' ll just have to see who gets put into the chief operating officer spot . Depending on the characteristics of the person , it will reveal itself more fully . " The company has indicated to analysts that the board will search for a new president and a future CEO , said Fuller , " with a belief that someone who has been groomed for CEO needs at least two years under Schoellhorn as an understudy . Duane Burnham is definitely a candidate for CEO . " Burnham is said by some sources to be a very adept financial manager . The developing pattern of resignations began in 1980 , when James L. Vincent gave up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schoellhorn was president and chief executive officer , having taken over the latter title after the retirement in 1979 of Chairman Edward J. Ledder . Vincent is now chairman and chief executive officer of Biogen Inc. , a 12-year-old bio-pharmaceutical company in Cambridge , Mass . Vincent said Monday that Schuler has " an outstanding track record " at Abbott . " I joined Abbott in ' 72 and Jack in ' 73 , " said Vincent . " We together started the diagnostics business for Abbott . At Abbott now , he ' s the person that ' s been most responsible for the success of the diagnostics division . He ' s an outstanding executive . " G. Kirk Raab resigned his post in 1985 and now heads Genentech Inc . Abramowitz opined that the " philosophical differences " more likely arise from the conflicting goals inherent in the jobs of chairman-CEO and president-chief operating officer . " The president is younger and is looking forward to becoming chairman and has a longer term outlook than the chairman , " said Abramowitz . " He will tend to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today that will pan out in five or 20 years , and that will produce a lot of earnings growth then . " The chairman wants to make sure nothing goes wrong during his shorter tenure , and he has the ultimate responsibility . He ' s the one who ' s going to get blamed if something goes astray . " The resignations of three such officers in 10 years are " disquieting , " says Abramowitz , " but on the other hand Abbott hasn ' t skipped a beat for 10 years . So it ' s just in no way obvious that Abbott has been harmed heretofore by these issues . Abbott is a great company and Schoellhorn and his management team have done superbly . " Schoellhorn ' s goal of 15 percent annual earnings growth " has been a goal of the company for 20 years , " says Abramowitz . " That predates Schoellhorn . You can see why Schoellhorn doesn ' t want to tamper with a record like that. "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
