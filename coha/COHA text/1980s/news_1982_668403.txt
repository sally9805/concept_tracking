Kerosene-fueled space heaters are for sale just about everywhere , but in Massachusetts they can not be fired up legally in places where people sleep , read , watch television or do any other indoor activity . Advertisements touting the free-standing , unvented heaters are now appearing in newspapers and on television . But look closely , because the ads all carry a warning that the heaters can not be used in places of habitation . Fire officials are appalled at the current national sales pitch because they have waged a 20-year war against the use of the devices . Massachusetts State Fire Marshal Joseph O ' Keefe says it is a case of winning a battle here and there , but losing the war . Boston Fire Chief George Paul says the warning required by law on kerosene heaters is " probably helpful , " but is almost meaningless to people who can not afford central heating or who are trying to save money and who will resort to any means to keep warm as cheaply as they can this winter . Additionally , Paul said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not cover fires caused by space heaters . Most insurance policies become null and void when an illegal act is involved in a claim . Last year 3 million portable kerosene heaters , mostly of Japanese manufacture , were sold in the United States , to people who were looking for any way to cut their heating costs . Sales of 5 million heaters are expected this year with a projection of upwards of 8 million by 1984 , industry sources report . The makers of the kerosene units say the improved heaters - which are built with tip-over shutoff switches and other safety devices - are in heavy use in Japan with no adverse experience . The Tokyo Fire Dept. , in a letter to a Massachusetts Fire Chiefs investigating committee , however , said the heaters were indeed being used there increasingly , but , " We in the fire service are under the impression that unvented portable space heaters should be eliminated . " Chief Haruo Ohno reported : " Unvented space heaters are causing great damage each year . . . . " Charts supplied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1980 were caused by defective space heaters . He said that from 1977 through 1980 , space heaters caused 687 of the city ' s 30,000 fires . The fires killed 687 persons and injured 5200 others . So the Boston Fire Department is again getting out the warning signs it used 10 years ago , when space-heater salesmen last tried a to bring them back . The signs say in large red letters : " Calentadores Matar ! " and " Riscaldamento Di Spazio Uccisione ! " , and in English : " Space Heaters Kill ! " Those warnings will be posted all over the city by the department ' s fire-prevention squad . " Poor people look upon space heaters as the answer to their prayers , " Paul says , " not realizing how dangerous these things really are . They have caused hundreds of fires in this city and more than 3000 statewide , taking 128 lives over the years . " Paul said the newer models are better-made than their counterparts of the 1950s , " but no one has yet come up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold kerosene is put into a hot heater . That ' s what makes them explode . " Tests conducted by the Boston Fire Department laboratory in the late 1950s found that the major cause of space-heater explosions was the vapor that develops when cold kerosene is warmed rapidly . When the vapor contacted an open flame , the heating units exploded . Laws governing the use of space heaters and their fuel are different from state to state , particularly in New England . If the Massachusetts law that bans the use of unvented space heaters , yet allows them to be sold , seems paradoxical , then consider Vermont . There , the law forbids the legislature to regulate conditions in private property . So in Vermont , you can buy space heaters and put them into your home . But you can ' t buy the special low-grade sulphur fuel the heaters need - because it is illegal to sell it in the state ( the result of a law promulgated by the state fireman ' s association . ) Then there ' s New Hampshire , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire chief gives you a permit to buy one , and then only if you live in a single-family home . The only problem with that is people can go to adjoining states and purchase the units without a permit . Maine requires only that the heaters be Underwriter ' s Laboratory- or University of Maine-approved , while Rhode Island calls only for UL approval but requires a smoke detector in each room with a space heater . All of the New England states ban the use of space heaters in multiple- famil y dwellings , public halls or hospitals . Widespread advertising has not been the only exposure given kerosene- fueled space heaters this fall . The October issue of Consumer Reports magazine features results of tests on a number of unvented space heaters , tests which found , in general , that the heaters were dangerous because they gave off fumes that could be hazardous to humans , and in some instances generated too much heat . Industry spokesmen immediately charged , in a news release , that engineers for Consumers Union , which publishes the magazine , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw the wrong conclusions . But spokesman David C. Berliner said Consumers Union would stand by its test results . He said engineers from CU ' s labs met recently with industry officials to explain their testing procedures . CU researchers and the Fire Chiefs Association of Massachusetts reached similar conclusions about the dangers of unvented space heaters . The association said the heaters can produce abnormally high concentrations of carbon monoxide , nitrogen , sulfur and carbon dioxide . In a report prepared for the Massachusetts Legislature earlier this year , the chiefs said the kerosene supplied to the Northeast by most major oil companies is not suitable for use in ventless space heaters . Most of the space heater companies produce a low-sulfur kerosene , but it sells for up to $2 a gallon . National fire safety consultant John T. O ' Hagan , former chief of the New York City Fire Department , says the cost of fuel makes the operation of space heaters " really quite expensive over . . . a winter . " He said the New York Fire Department recognized the inherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were banned in that city . " Most people don ' t know the difference between regular kerosene and the special , low-sulfur type that is suposed to be used . It follows that they will use the cheaper , readily obtainable type , which will result in a return to all of the tragedy we knew in those terrible days of the early 1950s , " O ' Hagan said . Chief Raymond Sorensen of Stoneham , who headed the Massachusetts Fire Chiefs Association committee which studied kerosene heaters , quoted the American Society for Testing and Materials , which reported the wrong kind of fuel would produce " excessive amounts of noxious and odorous sulphur dioxide which will be retained in a room and could build to harmful levels . " In 1980 the US Consumer Product Safety Commission voted 3-1 not to ban portable kerosene heaters , yet the agency ' s own figures showed that beween February 1980 and July 1981 there were 159 fires and 30 deaths associated with kerosene space heaters .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
