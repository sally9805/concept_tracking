Ken Russell updates Stravinsky in a splashy opera debut <P> Ken Russell has never been one to do anything halfway . Propelled by a flamboyant visual imagination , the British director , 54 , has shocked audiences with his horrific The Devils , astounded them with his psychedelic imagery for the rock opera Tommy and scandalized them with his racy , irreverent looks at mighty composers , such as Lisztomania . <P> All this has happened on the screen . Now Russell has turned to the stage for the first time-directing , of all unlikely things , Igor Stravinsky 's opera The Rake 's Progress at the 45th Maggio Musicale festival in Florence . Stravinsky , whose centenary is being celebrated this year , conducted the premiere of The Rake in Venice in 1951 , and the work has acquired the status of a classic among the composer 's admirers . But Russell , ever the iconoclast , has turned it upside down . The jejune quality of Stravinsky 's cool , mock-Mozartian music is engulfed in a rush of theatrical inventiveness that is often sensitively analytical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convincing-not an easy task with this opera . <P> The problem with The Rake has always been the music . Stravinsky 's neoclassical score is much admired by musicians for its technical accomplishment as a modernistic evocation of the classical period . But The Rake rarely succeeds at being anything more than a pastiche , and as a result , it fails to engage the emotions as a full-blooded opera should . <P> Russell 's great inspiration is to solve the paradox at the opera 's core , that of a modern work in courtly guise . If the music will not carry the dramatic load , then the action must . The director updates the splendid , rather literary W.H. Auden-Chester Kallmann libretto from 18th century to contemporary England without altering a word of text . Realized by Designer Derek Jarman , the images are vivid and immediate , painted in hard , splashy colors to evoke a drug-and crime-ridden world . <P> The Rake-inspired by the famous series of Hogarth engravings-tells the story of Tom Rakewell ( Tenor Gsta Winbergh ) , a naive but lustful country boy who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Baritone Istvan Gati ) . Abandoning his sweetheart Anne Trulove ( Soprano Cecilia Gasdia ) for the fleshpots of London , Tom sinks ever deeper into degradation until he finally goes mad and is committed to Bedlam . In Russell 's production , Tom sports a gold lame suit and a Sony Walkman . Baba the Turk , the bearded lady whom Tom marries , is a blind pop celebrity in a bright red dress whose comings and goings are recorded for posterity-or at least the evening news-by the watchful electronic media . Nick-who changes costumes to fit Tom 's changing impressions of him-commits suicide spectacularly by stepping on the third rail in a deserted London underground station called Angel . <P> " When they first asked me to do The Rake , " says Russell , " my heart sank because I had this memory of the most boring evening of my life . I 'm not interested in being different for its own sake , and the music in any opera is sacred to me . But if one is true to the spirit of a work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do what you like .
