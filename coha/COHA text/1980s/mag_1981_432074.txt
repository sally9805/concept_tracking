 | If a burglar invades their home , Jim and Kathy Crawford have a pistol and a plan of action . First , make lots of noise . If the intruder approaches the bedroom , hit him with skills gained from an $88 home-defense training course . " We 'd drop to the floor , " says Jim . " I 'd have the gun pointed at the door . If he came through that door , too bad for him . " The Crawfords of Indianapolis have joined one of the fastest-growing consumer trends in America , a scramble to achieve personal security against crime by any affordable means . The clamor for handguns continues unabated , accompanied by rising sales of weaponstraining courses for homeowners . Just as strong is the demand for safety devices ranging from simple dead-bolt locks to complex home-alarm systems . " Sales are going absolutely bananas , " says Jim Blandino , vice president of a St. Louis company that makes tear-gas sprays . Michael Green , whose North Miami Beach ironworks has seen annual sales of door and window bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , asserts that he " ca n't keep up . I 'm already working seven days a week . " Behind the passion for security , experts say , are changing lifestyles that make Americans more vulnerable to crime . The flood of women into the work force means many more homes , stand empty ? prey to daytime burglars . The soaring value of household goods gives thieves added incentive . Chief catalyst of the security boom , though , is fear for personal safety . Says one man who has just put a $2,500 alarm system in his suburban Detroit home : " To heck with the valuables . It 's our lives we 're concerned about . " Growth of the home-alarm industry typifies Americans ' craving for safety . Nationwide sales of residential burglar alarms rose from 83 million dollars in 1976 to 142 million in 1980 , with sales forecast to reach 240 million by 1984 . Some 14,000 companies are in the field , up from 10,000 five years ago . Equipment ranges from basic tripswitch alarms to delicate microphones and infrared sensors . Prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chain reaction . Increasingly popular are wireless systems , which are cheaper than wired models and usually involve window-mounted sensors linked by radio transmitters to an in-house control console . An attempt to open a window starts a chain reaction that ends with alarm bells . A recent refinement is linking such systems to police , fire or commercial monitoring points . Pressing a " panic button " sends a distress call over leased lines ? often a two-way cable-TV wire . For the very wealthy , another possible step is to buy housing that has fortresslike security built right in . In exclusive communities such as Houston 's suburban Sugar Creek and Lake Barrington Shores in Chicago , developers have included perimeter walls , guarded gates and security patrols . At Point East Condominiums in Beachwood , Ohio , those who can afford the $200,000-to-8500,000 prices think nothing of paying an extra $20 to $200 a month for constantly monitored alarm systems and around-the-clock guards . " The cost of security is hardly a sticking point , " says Warren Regent , a manager of condominiums in New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 percent of a tenant 's maintenance fee . " Simpler measures , within reach of middle-income Americans , are selling briskly , too . For instance , Abloy Security Locks of Niles , Ill. , has seen sales rise 35 percent in the first six months of 1981 . Willis Klein Safe &; Lock of Louisville says that " when gold and silver went up , safe sales went sky-high . " A rush to equip doors and windows with bars has turned the decorativeironworks industry into a multimilliondollar security business . Sales booms are reported from Miami to Detroit and New Orleans , where William Winterfeld started his burglar-bar business on a shoestring six years ago . Winterfeld 's annual sales now top 1 million dollars . " People want peace of mind , " he says . Turning the family pooch into a guard dog is another popular way to increase home security . The International School for Dogs in Cleveland cites a 300 percent rise in enrollments in its " defense pet " course over the past 18 months . For average fees of $575 , dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to bite ? when an intruder appears . Beyond such measures , more and  | more Americans are keeping handguns at home . In the Miami area , for instance , police reported 49,434 pistol registrations during the seven months that ended May 31 , compared with 24,937 in the same period of 1980 . Californians registered 325,041 handguns in 1980 , up 21 percent from 1979 . Gun shops report that cheap .38-caliber models are fastest sellers . But heavier weapons are moving , too . At The Traders in San Leandro , Calif. , for example , manager Jack Studley says 50 Israeli-made Uzi semiautomatic weapons sold out in six weeks , at 8695 apiece . Steadily rising gun sales have created a subindustry of firearms training for inexperienced buyers . Typical prices range from $30 to $50 , with advanced instruction covering low-light , rapidfire and prone-position shooting . " Our ranges are filled , " says John Caton , who notes a change in clientele at his South Florida training course . " Because of crime and violence , the average citizen has found a need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range was used primarily for sport . " Potent sprays . Cans that spray tear gas or paralyzing chemicals are popular in some places . In California last year , 95,000 people passed a test qualifying them to carry tear gas . And from January to May , 1981 , some 197,000 paid up to $30 each for training in tear-gas use . Some gun shops offer miniature chemical-spray devices that fit on keychains . " I sell tons of them , " says Donald Davis of Don 's Guns &; Galleries in Indianapolis . " I tell the ladies , if they 've got their keys in their hand , they 've got their Mace in their hand as well . " The array of exotic self-defense devices now available was evident at a Chicago trade conference in mid-June . Among the wares on display : A video intercom system , combining a TV camera and monitor screen with an electric door release . Zapper , a battery-powered device worn on the wrist .

One West Coast expert puts the annual total at 2 billion to 3 billion dollars ? with limitless potential for expansion . In any case , it is clear that people will exchange big chunks of income for added safety . " I wanted absolute security , " says Marty McGuire , a Chicago attorney who has just bought a weekend home at a tightly guarded resort near Chicago . " It gives you peace of mind , and that 's the greatest thing to have . "
