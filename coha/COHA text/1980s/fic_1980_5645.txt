Illustration : Illustrated by EMSH Cost of Living If easy payment plans were to be really efficient , patrons ' lifetimes had to be extended ! By ROBERT SHECKLEY Carrin decided that he could trace his present mood to Miller 's suicide last week . But the knowledge did n't help him get rid of the vague , formless fear in the back of his mind . It was foolish . Miller 's suicide did n't concern him . But why had that fat , jovial man killed himself ? Miller had had everything to live for  --  wife , kids , good job , and all the marvelous luxuries of the age . Why had he done it ? " Good morning , dear , " Carrin 's wife said as he sat down at the breakfast table . " Morning , honey . Morning , Billy . " His son grunted something . You just could n't tell about people , Carrin decided , and dialed his breakfast . The meal was gracefully prepared and served by the new Avignon Electric Auto-cook . His mood persisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form this morning . It was his day off , and the Avignon Electric finance man was coming . This was an important day . He walked to the door with his son . " Have a good day , Billy . " His son nodded , shifted his books and started to school without answering . Carrin wondered if something was bothering him , too . He hoped not . One worrier in the family was plenty . " See you later , honey . " He kissed his wife as she left to go shopping . At any rate , he thought , watching her go down the walk , at least she 's happy . He wondered how much she 'd spend at the A. E. store . Checking his watch , he found that he had half an hour before the A. E. finance man was due . The best way to get rid of a bad mood was to drown it , he told himself , and headed for the shower . * * * * * The shower room was a glittering plastic wonder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He threw his clothes into the A. E. automatic Kleen-presser , and adjusted the shower spray to a notch above " brisk . " The **35;0;TOOLONG water beat against his thin white body . Delightful ! And then a relaxing rub-dry in the A. E. Auto-towel . Wonderful , he thought , as the towel stretched and kneaded his stringy muscles . And it should be wonderful , he reminded himself . The A. E. Auto-towel with shaving attachments had cost three hundred and thirteen dollars , plus tax . But worth every penny of it , he decided , as the A. E. shaver came out of a corner and whisked off his rudimentary stubble . After all , what good was life if you could n't enjoy the luxuries ? His skin tingled when he switched off the Auto-towel . He should have been feeling wonderful , but he was n't . Miller 's suicide kept nagging at his mind , destroying the peace of his day off . Was there anything else bothering him ? Certainly there was nothing wrong with the house . His papers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten something ? " he asked out loud . " The Avignon Electric finance man will be here in fifteen minutes , " his A. E. bathroom Wall-reminder whispered . " I know that . Is there anything else ? " The Wall-reminder reeled off its memorized data  --  a vast amount of minutiae about watering the lawn , having the Jet-lash checked , buying lamb chops for Monday , and the like . Things he still had n't found time for . " All right , that 's enough . " He allowed the A. E. Auto-dresser to dress him , skillfully draping a new selection of fabrics over his bony frame . A whiff of fashionable masculine perfume finished him and he went into the living room , threading his way between the appliances that lined the walls . A quick inspection of the dials on the wall assured him that the house was in order . The breakfast dishes had been sanitized and stacked , the house had been cleaned , dusted , polished , his wife 's garments had been hung up , his son 's model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stop worrying , you hypochondriac , he told himself angrily . The door announced , " Mr. Pathis from Avignon Finance is here . " Carrin started to tell the door to open , when he noticed the Automatic Bartender . Good God , why had n't he thought of it ! The Automatic Bartender was manufactured by Castile Motors . He had bought it in a weak moment . A. E. would n't think very highly of that , since they sold their own brand . * * * * * He wheeled the bartender into the kitchen , and told the door to open . " A very good day to you , sir , " Mr. Pathis said . Pathis was a tall , imposing man , dressed in a conservative tweed drape . His eyes had the crinkled corners of a man who laughs frequently . He beamed broadly and shook Carrin 's hand , looking around the crowded living room . " A beautiful place you have here , sir . Beautiful ! As a matter of fact , I do n't think I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the nicest interior in this section . " Carrin felt a sudden glow of pride at that , thinking of the rows of identical houses , on this block and the next , and the one after that . " Now , then , is everything functioning properly ? " Mr. Pathis asked , setting his briefcase on a chair . " Everything in order ? " " Oh , yes , " Carrin said enthusiastically . " Avignon Electric never goes out of whack . " " The phone all right ? Changes records for the full seventeen hours ? " " It certainly does , " Carrin said . He had n't had a chance to try out the phone , but it was a beautiful piece of furniture . " The Solido-projector all right ? Enjoying the programs ? " " Absolutely perfect reception . " He had watched a program just last month , and it had been startlingly lifelike . " How about the kitchen ? Auto-cook in order ? Recipe-master still knocking ' em out ? " " Marvelous stuff . Simply marvelous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his vacuum cleaner , his car , his helicopter , his subterranean swimming pool , and the hundreds of other items Carrin had bought from Avignon Electric . " Everything is swell , " Carrin said , a trifle untruthfully since he had n't unpacked every item yet . " Just wonderful . " " I 'm so glad , " Mr. Pathis said , leaning back with a sigh of relief . " You have no idea how hard we try to satisfy our customers . If a product is n't right , back it comes , no questions asked . We believe in pleasing our customers . " " I certainly appreciate it , Mr. Pathis. " * * * * * Carrin hoped the A. E. man would n't ask to see the kitchen . He visualized the Castile Motors Bartender in there , like a porcupine in a dog show . " I 'm proud to say that most of the people in this neighborhood buy from us , " Mr. Pathis was saying . " We 're a solid firm . " " Was Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That fellow who killed himself ? " Pathis frowned briefly . " He was , as a matter of fact . That amazed me , sir , absolutely amazed me . Why , just last month the fellow bought a brand-new Jet-lash from me , capable of doing three hundred and fifty miles an hour on a straightaway . He was as happy as a kid over it , and then to go and do a thing like that ! Of course , the Jet-lash brought up his debt a little . " " Of course . " " But what did that matter ? He had every luxury in the world . And then he went and hung himself . " " Hung himself ? " " Yes , " Pathis said , the frown coming back . " Every modern convenience in his house , and he hung himself with a piece of rope . Probably unbalanced for a long time . " The frown slid off his face , and the customary smile replaced it . " But enough of that ! Let 's talk about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now , then , your account . You owe us two hundred and three thousand dollars and twenty-nine cents , Mr. Carrin , as of your last purchase . Right ? " " Right , " Carrin said , remembering the amount from his own papers . " Here 's my installment . " He handed Pathis an envelope , which the man checked and put in his pocket . " Fine . Now you know , Mr. Carrin , that you wo n't live long enough to pay us the full two hundred thousand , do n't you ? " " No , I do n't suppose I will , " Carrin said soberly . He was only thirty-nine , with a full hundred years of life before him , thanks to the marvels of medical science . But at a salary of three thousand a year , he still could n't pay it all off and have enough to support a family on at the same time . " Of course , we would not want to deprive you of necessities , which in any case is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To say nothing of the terrific items that are coming out next year . Things you would n't want to miss , sir ! " Mr. Carrin nodded . Certainly he wanted new items . " Well , suppose we make the customary arrangement . If you will just sign over your son 's earnings for the first thirty years of his adult life , we can easily arrange credit for you . " * * * * * Mr. Pathis whipped the papers out of his briefcase and spread them in front of Carrin . " If you 'll just sign here , sir . " " Well , " Carrin said , " I 'm not sure . I 'd like to give the boy a start in life , not saddle him with  --  " " But my dear sir , " Pathis interposed , " this is for your son as well . He lives here , does n't he ? He has a right to enjoy the luxuries , the marvels of science . " " Sure , " Carrin said . " Only  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is living like a king . A hundred years ago the richest man in the world could n't buy what any ordinary citizen possesses at present . You must n't look upon it as a debt . It 's an investment . " " That 's true , " Carrin said dubiously . He thought about his son and his rocket ship models , his star charts , his maps . Would it be right ? he asked himself . " What 's wrong ? " Pathis asked cheerfully . " Well , I was just wondering , " Carrin said . " Signing over my son 's earnings  --  you do n't think I 'm getting in a little too deep , do you ? " " Too deep ? My dear sir ! " Pathis exploded into laughter . " Do you know Mellon down the block ? Well , do n't say I said it , but he 's already mortgaged his grandchildren 's salary for their full life-expectancy ! And he does n't have half the goods he 's made up his mind to own ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer is our job and we know it well . " Carrin wavered visibly . " And after you 're gone , sir , they 'll all belong to your son . " That was true , Carrin thought . His son would have all the marvelous things that filled the house . And after all , it was only thirty years out of a life expectancy of a hundred and fifty . He signed with a flourish . " Excellent ! " Pathis said . " And by the way , has your home got an A. E. Master-operator ? " It had n't . Pathis explained that a Master-operator was new this year , a stupendous advance in scientific engineering . It was designed to take over all the functions of housecleaning and cooking , without its owner having to lift a finger . " Instead of running around all day , pushing half a dozen different buttons , with the Master-operator all you have to do is push one ! A remarkable achievement ! " Since it was only five hundred and thirty-five dollars , Carrin signed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Right 's right , he thought , walking Pathis to the door . This house will be Billy 's some day . His and his wife 's . They certainly will want everything up-to-date . Just one button , he thought . That would be a time-saver ! * * * * * After Pathis left , Carrin sat back in an adjustable chair and turned on the solido . After twisting the Ezi-dial , he discovered that there was nothing he wanted to see . He tilted back the chair and took a nap . The something on his mind was still bothering him . " Hello , darling ! " He awoke to find his wife was home . She kissed him on the ear . " Look . " She had bought an A. E. Sexitizer-negligee . He was pleasantly surprised that that was all she had bought . Usually , Leela returned from shopping laden down . " It 's lovely , " he said . She bent over for a kiss , then giggled  --  a habit he knew she had picked up from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Going to dial supper , " she said , and went to the kitchen . Carrin smiled , thinking that soon she would be able to dial the meals without moving out of the living room . He settled back in his chair , and his son walked in . " How 's it going , Son ? " he asked heartily . " All right , " Billy answered listlessly . " What'sa matter , Son ? " The boy stared at his feet , not answering . " Come on , tell Dad what 's the trouble . " Billy sat down on a packing case and put his chin in his hands . He looked thoughtfully at his father . " Dad , could I be a Master Repairman if I wanted to be ? " Mr. Carrin smiled at the question . Billy alternated between wanting to be a Master Repairman and a rocket pilot . The repairmen were the elite . It was their job to fix the automatic repair machines . The repair machines could fix just about anything , but you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine . That was where the Master Repairmen came in . But it was a highly competitive field and only a very few of the best brains were able to get their degrees . And , although the boy was bright , he did n't seem to have an engineering bent . " It 's possible , Son . Anything is possible . " " But is it possible for me ? " " I do n't know , " Carrin answered , as honestly as he could . " Well , I do n't want to be a Master Repairman anyway , " the boy said , seeing that the answer was no . " I want to be a space pilot . " " A space pilot , Billy ? " Leela asked , coming in to the room . " But there are n't any . " " Yes , there are , " Billy argued . " We were told in school that the government is going to send some men to Mars . " " They 've been saying that for a hundred years , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to doing it . " " They will this time . " " Why would you want to go to Mars ? " Leela asked , winking at Carrin . " There are no pretty girls on Mars . " " I 'm not interested in girls . I just want to go to Mars . " " You would n't like it , honey , " Leela said . " It 's a nasty old place with no air . " " It 's got some air . I 'd like to go there , " the boy insisted sullenly . " I do n't like it here . " " What 's that ? " Carrin asked , sitting up straight . " Is there anything you have n't got ? Anything you want ? " " No , sir . I 've got everything I want . " Whenever his son called him ' sir , ' Carrin knew that something was wrong . " Look , Son , when I was your age I wanted to go to Mars , too . I wanted to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Repairman . " " Then why did n't you ? " " Well , I grew up . I realized that there were more important things . First I had to pay off the debt my father had left me , and then I met your mother  --  " Leela giggled . "  --  and I wanted a home of my own . It 'll be the same with you . You 'll pay off your debt and get married , the same as the rest of us. " * * * * * Billy was silent for a while , then he brushed his dark hair  --  straight , like his father 's  --  back from his forehead and wet his lips . " How come I have debts , sir ? " Carrin explained carefully . About the things a family needed for civilized living , and the cost of those items . How they had to be paid . How it was customary for a son to take on a part of his parent 's debt , when he came of age . Billy 's silence annoyed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . After he had slaved for years to give the ungrateful whelp every luxury ! " Son , " he said harshly , " have you studied history in school ? Good . Then you know how it was in the past . Wars . How would you like to get blown up in a war ? " The boy did n't answer . " Or how would you like to break your back for eight hours a day , doing work a machine should handle ? Or be hungry all the time ? Or cold , with the rain beating down on you , and no place to sleep ? " He paused for a response , got none and went on . " You live in the most fortunate age mankind has ever known . You are surrounded by every wonder of art and science . The finest music , the greatest books and art , all at your fingertips . All you have to do is push a button . " He shifted to a kindlier tone . " Well , what are you thinking ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mars , " the boy said . " With the debt , I mean . I do n't suppose I could get away from that . " " Of course not . " " Unless I stowed away on a rocket . " " But you would n't do that . " " No , of course not , " the boy said , but his tone lacked conviction . " You 'll stay here and marry a very nice girl , " Leela told him . " Sure I will , " Billy said . " Sure . " He grinned suddenly . " I did n't mean any of that stuff about going to Mars . I really did n't . " " I 'm glad of that , " Leela answered . " Just forget I mentioned it , " Billy said , smiling stiffly . He stood up and raced upstairs . " Probably gone to play with his rockets , " Leela said . " He 's such a little devil . " * * * * * The Carrins ate a quiet supper , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . He was on night shift this month . He kissed his wife good-by , climbed into his Jet-lash and roared to the factory . The automatic gates recognized him and opened . He parked and walked in . Automatic lathes , automatic presses  --  everything was automatic . The factory was huge and bright , and the machines hummed softly to themselves , doing their job and doing it well . Carrin walked to the end of the automatic washing machine assembly line , to relieve the man there . " Everything all right ? " he asked . " Sure , " the man said . " Have n't had a bad one all year . These new models here have built-in voices . They do n't light up like the old ones . " Carrin sat down where the man had sat and waited for the first washing machine to come through . His job was the soul of simplicity . He just sat there and the machines went by him . He pressed a button on them and found out if they were all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines went to the packaging section . The first one slid by on the long slide of rollers . He pressed the starting button on the side . " Ready for the wash , " the washing machine said . Carrin pressed the release and let it go by . That boy of his , Carrin thought . Would he grow up and face his responsibilities ? Would he mature and take his place in society ? Carrin doubted it . The boy was a born rebel . If anyone got to Mars , it would be his kid . But the thought did n't especially disturb him . " Ready for the wash . " Another machine went by . Carrin remembered something about Miller . The jovial man had always been talking about the planets , always kidding about going off somewhere and roughing it . He had n't , though . He 'd committed suicide . " Ready for the wash . " Carrin had eight hours in front of him , and he loosened his belt to prepare for it . Eight hours of pushing buttons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the wash . " He pressed the release . " Ready for the wash . " Carrin 's mind strayed from the job , which did n't need much attention in any case . He wished he had done what he had longed to do as a youngster . It would have been great to be a rocket pilot , to push a button and go to Mars .  --  ROBERT
