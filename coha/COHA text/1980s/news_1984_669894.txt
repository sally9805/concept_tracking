Sidney Lumet ' s best movies have been intense , gritty New York stories : " The Pawnbroker , " " Network , " " Serpico , " " Dog Day Afternoon , " " Prince of the City . " Lightheartedness hasn ' t really suited this director . Take " The Wiz , " for example . And his new movie , " Garbo Talks , " a weepy New York fairy tale , has enough schmaltz in it to choke you . But it also has some sweetly loopy character bits that are delightful . " Garbo Talks " is about the dying wish of Estelle Rolfe ( Anne Bancroft ) , a fervent crusader against injustice and a diehard romantic when it comes to Greta Garbo . She wants her son Gilbert , an accountant , to bring her face to face with the famously reclusive , retired Swedish film star . Miss Garbo , of course , vants to be alone . The dutiful Gilbert ( Ron Silver ) tries to do right by his mom . And his search allows Mr. Lumet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cramped , overfurnished studios of aging New York theater people . Many of these scenes , especially the one with Dorothy Louden as a daffy agent , are poignant and surprising . But the bright moments must shine through the thick cloud of sentimentality Mr. Lumet has blown across his movie . Cancer as a moving plot force , for example , has been overdone . And most of the satire , including a clumsy portrayal of Gilbert ' s Jewish American Princess wife by Carrie Fisher , is painful . Still , the movie is worth watching for Anne Bancroft ' s dazzling comic number as an eccentric , lumpy woman who lectures construction workers who whistle at pretty pedestrians and then falls apart sobbing at old Garbo movies . She ' s like a younger Ruth Gordon , zany , but seriously zany.  --  - " Comfort and Joy " is a new movie from Scottish director Bill Forsyth , who brought us " Local Hero " and " Gregory ' s Girl . " Mr. Forsyth , as expected , serves up plenty of whimsy-on-wry , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his previous efforts . But it ' s engaging enough , and the mellow jazz score by Mark Knopfler is terrific . Mr. Forsyth ' s screenplay is about a radio announcer ' s midlife crisis . Throughout the film we hear radio voices commenting on the traffic , the weather , new cereal brands . Alan the announcer ( Bill Paterson ) has just had his girlfriend walk out on him . And he spends much of the movie trying to bring meaning to his life by ending a feud between competing ice-cream vendors . The plot sounds strange because it is . But , as with Mr. Forsyth ' s other films , plot is merely a device for having offbeat , likable characters bump into one another and spout wonderfully droll dialogue . For example , after his girl has left , Alan moans to a friend : " I worshipped her . " His friend responds , wisely : " That ' s not the nicest thing you can do to someone . Do you worship me ? " " No ! " replies Alan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Joy " is light as whipped cream and just as sweet.  --  - Here ' s my report-card comment for " Teachers " : This new movie about the chaos that is public high school doesn ' t achieve its full potential . This movie takes the same kind of absurdist , hard-edged approach toward modern education that its director Arthur Hiller took toward medicine with " The Hospital . " But , unlike " The Hospital , " which made its serious points with sharp humor , " Teachers " is pedantic and predictable , like a well-meaning television show . ( In fact , it would make a very good TV show , an updated " Room 222 . " ) A former student has sued John F. Kennedy High for graduating him illiterate . The lawsuit frames a story about a school where a mental-hospital outpatient has become a popular substitute teacher , where another teacher is so taciturn that several classes troop in and out without noticing that he ' s dead , and where students preoccupy themselves with drugs , abortions and general mayhem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaggy and swaggering , teacher whose former idealism has been reduced to the Hawaiian shirts he wears in his classroom . Both Judd Hirsch and Ralph Macchio are good to watch as a **36;175;TOOLONG and a tough kid . What ultimately drags the movie down is the unfortunate role dumped on Jobeth Williams , the **28;213;TOOLONG who represents the kid suing the school . A romance is cooked up between her and the Nolte character , just so he can tell her : " When you drop that shield and walk down those halls naked , I ' ll believe you can see what ' s happening . " In the last scene , Ms. Williams does just that . It ' s hard to tell whether she gained any insight into student life during her frantic topless romp , but at least she got an R rating for the film.  --  - " Impulse " is such a poor execution of a potentially fascinating supernatural notion I thought it must be a movie adaption of a Stephen King novel . I was close . Don Carlos Dunaway , who co-wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of " Cujo , " one of the Thriller King ' s novels . According to the press kit , " Impulse ' s " makers asked themselves this question : " Imagine what would happen if every desire , every urge , every passion locked deep inside us were to be released ? " They concluded boldly : Mischief will turn to murder . Unfortunately , most moviegoers aren ' t handed these helpful hints with their tickets when they pay their $5 . So they are likely to be bored , waiting for the very leisurely plot to unfold , not knowing for sure that mischief is about to happen . Then they ' re likely to be as confused as Jennifer ( Meg Tilly ) and Stuart ( Tim Matheson ) , who stumble around her hometown trying to figure out why everyone is acting so weirdly ( small children gleefully try to set adults on fire ; grown-up sheriffs machine-gun small children ) . The theater audience I sat through this with did occasionally laugh , mainly at the inexplicable , cameo appearance of Mr. Matheson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scares , though , were scarce . Nothing puts the kibosh on suspense like a bunch of characters so flimsy you can ' t tell when they ' ve disappeared.
