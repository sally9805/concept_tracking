With more than 200 crops and a growing season that spans most of the year , California agriculture was considered too diversified to be laid low by the capriciousness of the weather and marketplace that periodically shook the the Middle West ' s Farm Belt , with its high dependence on wheat , corn and a few other crops. // But , concedes Henry J. Voss , president of the California Farm Bureau Federation , " We were wrong. " // Hundreds of growers in the state have lost their farms this year through foreclosures or distress sales . And before the current troubles end , Mr. Voss predicted , about 25 percent of the state ' s 35 , 000 full-time farmers will have " zero net worth " and will be forced out of business. // // Federation Chief Sees ' a Problem ' // " These are not speculators or people who were greedy , " he said . " Many of these people are good farmers , who made the right decisions , who were conservative in their operations . When the best farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Whatever the crop , be it cotton , rice , beef , grapes , raisins , almonds or hops , there seems to be an imbalance in the supply-and-demand equation that is choking California growers , many of whom are heavily in debt for land no longer worth what they paid for it. // Here in Fresno County , whose $2 billion a year in farm sales makes it the most productive farming county in the nation , Bill Allison , manager of the Fresno Farm Bureau , an association of farmers , said he saw no improvement on the horizon . <> <> Values of Land Are Halved // " You ' ve got a situation where land values are about 50 percent of what they were four years ago , " he said. // Virtually the only crops being grown profitably in the state these days , farmers say , are oranges and lemons . Besides poor weather in Florida citrus groves this year , they attribute this to an unusual Federal law that allows growers in California and Arizona to agree among themselves how much fruit they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // For growers of premium wine grapes in California ' s coastal valleys , things are not so bad , said Robert Hartzell , president of the California Association of Winegrape Growers. // But for the much larger number of growers of grapes used to make jug wines , for sale as table grapes and for drying as raisins here in the San Joaquin Valley , the prospect is for more bankruptcies . <> <> Source of Pressures on Farmers // For the most part , experts attribute the problems facing California farmers to the same forces that have had disastrous effects on farmers elsewhere in the country : slumping commodity prices , reduced exports , and a sharp drop in the value of farm land purchased with borrowed money. // In the past , the diversity of agriculture in California , whose production of $14 billion a year in farm products exceeds all other states , allowed it to weather difficulties faced elsewhere. // If one or two crops were in trouble , others sold well and overall farming did well . But that has not happened in 1985 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began in 1981 when the value of the dollar abroad soared , raising the cost of American products sold overseas. // After peaking at $4. 3 million in 1981 , the state ' s farm exports fell to $2. 9 billion in 1984. // According to preliminary figures , the decline continued through the early part of this year . Although the dollar has subsequently gained strength , many farmers say they are fearful they may never regain overseas markets lost in the early 1980 ' s . <> <> Losses of Jobs and Exports // Researchers at the University of California estimated 100 , 000 state jobs have been lost in farming , food processing and related fields because of reduced farm exports since 1980. // Many of the growers who have been having financial troubles this year are not family farmers like those who have suffered the brunt of agriculture ' s problems in the Middle West , but large corporate entities that farm huge tracts in the San Joaquin Valley with the most modern technology. // " We ' ve been surprised that so many large operators have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farm Bureau . " A lot of these big companies leveraged themselves to the hilt , using the equity in their land , and now the land isn ' t worth what it used to. " // For years large corporate farms such as those operated by the J. G. Boswell Company , Tennaco Inc. and the Tejon Ranch Company have been regarded as models of how to make money on a grand scale in agriculture . <> <> Large Companies Are Hit Hard // But experts say that depressed prices for cotton and other commodities have hit large agribusiness companies especially hard this year. // The depth of the troubles was dramatized by two recent events that many Californians would have found unimaginable a few years ago. // About 50 members of the United Farm Workers , the union founded by Cesar Chavez , which for years has clashed , sometimes violently , with growers , staged a demonstration at the San Francisco headquarters of the Wells Fargo Bank on behalf of Salinas Valley vegetable growers who had lost credit in a general tightening on farm loan policies being imposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fearful that credit restrictions would lead to further layoffs in the fields. // In perhaps an even more unusual development , several major growers in Kern County south of here said that they might be willing to sell rights to some of their irrigation water to fast-growing metropolitan areas in southern California. // In the past , California growers have unrelentingly opposed any proposals to divert water earmarked for irrigation to urban use . <> <> Growers Relent on Water Rights // But , blaming hard times in farming , the growers advised officials of the California State Water Project , which brings irrigation water from the High Sierras east of the valley through a multibillion-dollar network of dams and canals , that they might have to default on payments owed for the water. // As an alternative to defaulting , some growers said they would consider selling thousands of acres of farm land , and the water rights that go with the land , to the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. // Officials of the district , a water wholesaler to communities from Los Angeles south to San Diego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal . If consummated , it would help cities in southern California replace a significant portion of water they now receive from the Colorado River but are scheduled to lose to Arizona soon as the result of a 1964 decision of the United States Supreme Court. // Frederick Cannon , an agricultural economist for the Bank of America , said that for some permanent-planted crops such as grapes and almonds , he expects demand to come in better balance with supply next year as a result of recent retrenchment and a slight improvement in sales . But over all , and especially for producers of field crops such as cotton and rice , he said , " the hard times will continue. " //
