 | Take a hill a little too quickly , stretch for a ball a bit too far , twist or turn awkwardly and , snap , something gives . In pursuit of healthier bodies and recreation , Americans incur an estimated 17 million sports-related injuries each year , ranging from stubbed toes and pulled muscles to torn tendons , ruptured ligaments and fractured bones . Anxious to get off the sidelines as quickly as possible , exercise enthusiasts are turning in increasing numbers to a new breed of healer , the sports-medicine specialist . Once concerned mainly with the aches , pains and injuries of professional athletes , the ranks of sports docs have grown from a few hundred in the early 1970s to more than 10,000 today . And the field of sports medicine itself , although still in its infancy , is gaining credibility . Most medical experts now agree that you should see a sports specialist rather than your regular doctor or family physician when you have a sports injury that deserves medical attention . Armed with a sophisticated array of diagnostic and rehabilitative equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joints , measure your muscle strength , soothe your aches and pains , and ease injured limbs and joints back to health . Torn knee ligaments that once doomed skiers , football players and other athletes to a life of taking it easy , for example , are now being surgically replaced with ligaments taken from elsewhere in the body and , more recently , with synthetic fibers . And the once routine practice of treating sports injuries with prolonged rest and inactivity has yielded to finely honed rehabilitation regimens that cut recovery time significantly . Exercise in excess . For most injured athletes , neither a trip to a sports doctor nor extensive rehabilitation is necessary . In fact , most sports injuries are relatively minor . " Half the people I see need not have come to me , " says Dr. James Garrick , head of the Center for Sports Medi cine at Saint Francis Hospital in San Francisco . " They could have handled the problem themselves . " Nearly two thirds of all sports injuries , such as runner 's knee and tennis elbow , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too far or for too long . Although these injuries to tendons , ligaments , muscles and bones are often painful and frustrating , there is little a doctor can do for you that you ca n't do for yourself . What drives most people to a doctor is the sheer amount of time it can take some injuries to heal . Even minor maladies , such as pulled muscles and strained backs , may not ease for two weeks . And tendinitis can last for months if you do n't cut back on the activity that gave rise to it . Top sports doctors say patients often are just seeking reassurance that an injury is not really serious . But it is increasingly clear that many sports doctors order up a battery of tests anyway , on the basis that it is better to be safe than sorry . X-rays are done routinely , for example , even when an injury does n't appear to be acute . A full set of X-rays can cost $50 to $200 on top of the doctor 's fee of $50 to $100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little . A quarter of the estimated 500,000 arthroscopy procedures done each year , at $500 to $1,500 each , may also be unnecessary . In this procedure , a tiny camera is surgically placed into the knee joint to help doctors detect and repair torn tendons and ligaments . " There is a big effort now to cut back on all these tests , because we realize they are being overdone , " says Dr. Frank Noyes , head of the Cincinnati Sports Medicine &; Orthopedic Center . If a doctor tells you that you 're likely to receive the same type of treatment regardless of what an X-ray , arthroscopy or other diagnostic test shows , then you probably do n't need it . In the case of arthroscopy , as with all surgery , you may want to obtain a second opinion even if your doctor is convinced that it is necessary . Physical therapy , the hands-on rehabilitative exercises that can speed recovery from many serious sports injuries , also should be viewed with skepticism . " In . most cases , patients with minor injuries can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements that they need to do to promote healing , " notes Dr. Robert Cantu , director of sports medicine at Emerson Hospital in Concord , Mass . Some sports doctors also have an added incentive to refer patients to physical therapy : They either own or have a financial stake in the facilities where such care is given . These doctors argue that this arrangement gives them better control over a patient 's care , but critics , including many physical therapists , charge that it poses a conflict of interest . " We 'd prefer to work independently , " says Robert Mangine , chairman of the sports-medicine branch of the American Physical Therapy Association . He estimates that 40 percent of the group 's 5,000 members work for doctor-owned therapy centers . Physical therapists are n't immune to overusing some of the new tools of sports medicine , either . Custom-made shoe inserts , or orthotics , are indispensable when used to compensate for high arches or pronation , when one foot or both tend to slope in or out , increasing your risk of  | knee injuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or prevent the majority of minor foot and knee injuries , for which they are often prescribed , at a cost of $50 to $300 . The same can be said for elaborate knee braces , now very much in vogue . Although essential to stabilize a knee that has suffered a torn ligament or tendon or been operated on , they are useless in treating lesser injuries . Moreover , studies now show that knee braces do n't help prevent reinjury when worn during contact sports , like football . Both orthotics and knee braces , along with ankle , neck and back braces , can be prescribed by either a sports doc or physical therapist . How bad is it ? Pain is not always a reliable guide when you are trying to distinguish an injury that requires a doctor 's attention from one that does not . A torn ligament in the knee may not hurt that much , but it should be seen by a doctor as soon as possible . Telltale signs of such an injury are a sense that the knee is unstable and loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a partial ligament tear , is usually much more painful and can look like a severe injury when swelling sets in . But you do n't need to see a doctor for a sprained ankle . One sign that an ankle is sprained rather than fractured or broken is that you can move it and put some weight on it . Likewise , tendon and ligament strains , often lumped together and called tendinitis , do not require medical care . But in contrast to ankle sprains , the pain they generate may be only slight at first , becoming more annoying only if you do n't scale back the activity that has aggravated the tendon . By applying ice to the injury area immediately , you can significantly reduce the recovery time for most minor injuries . Identifying a reputable sports-medicine doctor or clinic when you need one can be difficult . There is no formal certification in sports medicine . And any doctor who wants to tap this increasingly lucrative market need simply hang out a shingle . That goes for groups , as well . Sports-medicine clinics have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , they are no more reliable than individual practitioners and should be approached with equal scrutiny . One thing you should ask about is special training . Several medical groups offer programs in sports medicine . Most notable are the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine , the American College of Sports Medicine and the American Academy of Sports Physicians . Doctors who belong to these groups are the most likely to have updated information , skills and training . Young doctors who have just started in the field should have at least a yearlong fellowship at a sports-medicine clinic as part of their postgraduate training . In general , orthopedic surgeons who have developed a focus in sports medicine are the most highly trained . And leading sports doctors recommend that for serious injuries that may require surgery , you should go to an orthopedic surgeon whose practice is devoted full time to sports medicine . Complicating your choice still further is a growing number of chiropractors , podiatrists and osteopaths who also practice sports medicine . In many instances , these practitioners are as highly trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Podiatrists , in particular , have a long history of skillful care of foot problems . One annoying sports injury is usually enough to convince most people of the importance of pacing themselves . A good sports doctor should show you how to do that , particularly if you are coming back from a serious injury . Pushing it too hard can put you out of commission for a frustratingly long time .
