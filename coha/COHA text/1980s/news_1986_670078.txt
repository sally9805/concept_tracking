SAN FRANCISCO  --  BankAmerica Corp. ' s board is expected to request the resignation of Samuel H. Armacost , the company ' s embattled president and chief executive officer , as early as Sunday , banking industry sources said . His ouster , which would end a tumultuous five years at the helm of the nation ' s second-largest banking concern , would occur as the troubled company is under pressure from regulators and is studying a takeover offer from First Interstate Bancorp after being unable to turn its fortunes around . The sources said A.W. Clausen , Mr. Armacost ' s predecessor , is likely to return as BankAmerica ' s chief executive . Mr. Clausen , 63 years old , resigned as president of the World Bank effective last June . The changes in management could be decided at a meeting of BankAmerica ' s 14-member board scheduled for Sunday . Separately , BankAmerica ' s chairman , Leland S. Prussia , 57 , also is expected to resign . It isn ' t believed that Mr. Prussia is being directly forced out . BankAmerica declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were being planned . Through a spokesman , Mr. Armacost , 47 , declined to comment on either his tenure or board matters . Resignation by Mr. Armacost would end a tenure remarkable for its number of debacles , and for his ability to survive them . His departure also would reflect a sharp and sudden break in board support . BankAmerica ' s directors have steadfastly backed Mr. Armacost since he took over in April 1981 , despite the company ' s record loan losses , shrinking market share and other ills , and they have been heavily criticized for doing so . But now the board is said to be prepared to act , reportedly because of concern about BankAmerica ' s deteriorating financial condition , a recent raft of rumors that shook investor confidence and pounded the company ' s stock price , and indirect regulatory pressure to find new leadership . Yesterday , in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , BankAmerica common closed at $14. 25 a share , off 50 cents , on volume of 1. 2 million shares . The sources said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board members in particular , John R. Beckett , retired chairman of Transamerica Corp. , and John R. Grey , the retired president of Chevron Corp . Messrs . Beckett and Grey , both longtime San Francisco executives , are also considered allies of Mr. Clausen . Less likely but possible candidates for the top post are Thomas Cooper , 50 , president of the company ' s Bank of America unit , and , perhaps on an interim basis , Mr. Beckett . Mr. Beckett is chairman of the BankAmerica board ' s executive committee . Yesterday , neither Mr. Beckett nor Mr. Grey could be reached for comment . A return by Mr. Clausen would be highly unusual , as well as extraordinarily ironic . While Mr. Clausen was BankAmerica ' s chief executive between 1970 and 1981 , the company expanded to become a highly profitable world banking power , aggressively extending farm , energy , shipping and foreign loans . But many of those same loans later soured during Mr. Armacost ' s regime . Nonetheless , a banking industry source said , " Clausen has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s job . Another source close to the bank asserted that Mr. Clausen ' s return was almost certain , saying : " The board has panicked , and in a panic situation you go with the guy you know . " The management shake-up would come about a week after BankAmerica received First Interstate ' s takeover offer , valued at $2. 78 billion , or $18 a share . Joseph J. Pinola , chairman and chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based First Interstate , spent 25 years at BankAmerica , but left in 1976 , thinking he would never have a chance to succeed Mr. Clausen . Sources said any changes could be the first step in a BankAmerica campaign to remain independent . Many analysts and bankers believe BankAmerica ' s stock price has been depressed partly because of investor disenchantment with current management . The expected moves mean that BankAmerica " may be able to kiss First Interstate off for a while and say it has to figure out where it ' s going , " said a merger specialist who previously has worked for BankAmerica . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a change " would have a positive effect " among investors . But this source added : " There is no individual who can perform the alchemy of turning a nonperforming loan into a gold mine . You ' ve got to wonder whether anybody can turn it ( BankAmerica ) around . " Indeed , deposing Mr. Armacost isn ' t expected to accomplish much , although some bank analysts have said in the past that BankAmerica ' s stock price would increase slightly on the assumption that a successor would move more quickly to cut costs . Other than that , seeking Mr. Armacost ' s resignation now simply would be asking him to take responsibility for a series of disasters that largely weren ' t his doing , sources said . Banking industry sources said the board , or Mr. Beckett , established an informal executive search committee several weeks after BankAmerica reported a $640 million second-quarter loss in mid-July , the latest in a string of quarterly earnings debacles . But the sources said a series of rumors about BankAmerica ' s condition and prospects during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price to near-record lows , bolstered the board ' s resolve to make a change . The rumors " made them realize how vulnerable the company really was , and that nothing would change while Sam was at the helm , " a source close to BankAmerica said . Then , late last month , the sources said , Messrs . Beckett and Grey met privately with federal banking regulators to discuss the rumors and BankAmerica ' s situation . It isn ' t known whether federal officials suggested changes at that time , but banking regulators acknowledged Wednesday that they believe BankAmerica needs new management . When asked whether two BankAmerica directors met in late September with Fed chairman Paul Volcker or his aides , a Federal Reserve Board spokesman in Washington said , " No such meeting occurred , period . " If Mr. Clausen is selected to succeed Mr. Armacost , it would be a disturbing appointment for many of Mr. Armacost ' s handpicked senior managers . Some of those managers have helped Mr. Armacost force out top executives who were part of Mr. Clausen ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank ' s current difficulties . " He ' s the guy who started all these problems , " a middle-level manager said . " It ' s incredible . " Mr. Armacost ' s undoing would be linked inextricably with the tactics that Mr. Clausen used to make BankAmerica the biggest and most profitable U.S. banking company in the 1970s . In his last years at the company , Mr. Clausen doubled its portfolio of fixed-rate mortgages and its agricultural lending , quintupled construction lending and added $9 billion of foreign loans , many of them high-risk credits to private borrowers in Latin America and Africa . Meanwhile , BankAmerica didn ' t invest heavily in new technology or other infrastructure , and its operations became increasingly decentralized and lacking in controls . But in 1980 , Mr. Clausen ' s strategy produced earnings of $646 million , a record for any U.S. financial institution . Starting in 1981 ' s first quarter , the expansion began to produce loan losses that would later soar to enormous levels . Indeed , many of the debacles reported during Mr. Armacost ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge losses on an Argentine bank and a Nigerian affiliate , innumerable private-borrower defaults and many of the farm-loan losses . Mr. Clausen couldn ' t be reached for comment . He previously has declined to comment on matters relating to his BankAmerica tenure . Mr. Armacost shares some responsibility for the losses . As head of the bank ' s European division , for instance , he signed his name to foreign loans that later soured , including Greek shipping loans that turned into huge losses in 1985 and 1986 . Moreover , an increasing number of the bad loans reported in the past two years were made under his tenure , particularly real-estate loans that became a major problem . Some BankAmerica officials assert that Mr. Armacost also didn ' t attack BankAmerica ' s problems or its organizational flaws quickly enough , and never had the ruthlessness necessary to slash costs or fire thousands of people . That chore fell recently to Mr. Cooper , who has eliminated 2 , 300 jobs in the past two months ; the company currently employs about 76 , 000 people world-wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of BankAmerica ' s operations and embarking on a new strategy of expanding West Coast retail operations while narrowing its national and international lending . But he never got a handle on a giant bureaucracy that had deteriorated for years because of a failure to financially reward or adequately promote its best and brightest managers . In the second quarter of 1985 , for instance , Mr. Armacost was stunned when examiners from the federal Comptroller of the Currency ' s office told him that Bank of America would have to make an unexpectedly huge $527 million addition to its loan-loss reserve . The action caused a $338 million quarterly loss . In a harshly worded memo to his top managers , Mr. Armacost complained that he was blindsided by the examiners , saying the losses " mostly relate to managers not sufficiently involved in the business issues their units face , and consequently not communicating upward their real expectation of earnings . " Soon after the 1986 second quarter ended , Mr. Armacost traveled to Tokyo on business . While there , he was informed that incoming field reports from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan loss . He canceled his appointments and flew back to San Francisco , where he was told that BankAmerica must charge-off $388 million of bad loans and add $600 million to the loan-loss reserve . Those actions caused a $640 million loss , the second-largest ever reported by a U.S. bank . " Clausen planted the seeds , but Armacost screwed up too , " the middle-level manager said . " There is no way you can blame all this on Tom or Sam . It was a joint effort. "  --  - The Troubles of Armacost Dec. 1 , 1980  --  Samuel H. Armacost named to succeed A.W.
