It may have been Ronald Reagan 's worst week in the Oval Office . His deft touch at manipulating political symbols faltered ; the continuing storm over his planned visit to the German cemetery at Bitburg on Sunday put the President in a painful predicament with no graceful way out . His vaunted powers of persuasion could not avert a stinging defeat in the House , which killed all proposals for U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan contras for now . The Soviets turned more than normally truculent , and the U.S. economy developed some worrisome rumbles . Reagan 's eternally sunny optimism for once clouded over . " He is in anguish over Bitburg , and he is bitter about the House vote , " reported one senior adviser . <P> Even Reagan 's fabled mastery of television was failing , at least temporarily , to work its accustomed magic . In a forceful speech to the nation on Wednesday night , the President summoned all his rhetorical resources to appeal for public support of the $52 billion in spending cuts in the fiscal 1986 budget plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Please tell your Senators and Representatives by phone , wire or Mailgram that our future hangs in the balance . " <P> Some people responded , but not enough to sway the crucial votes immediately . The Republican leaders of the Senate had planned to call for a vote on the compromise budget package they had worked out with the White House on Thursday , to take advantage of the impetus they expected from Reagan 's speech . But that day it was the Democrats who dared them to go ahead , while Reagan 's G.O.P. allies repeatedly postponed a ballot that they knew they could not win . <P> A vote is now scheduled for this week , and it is entirely possible that Reagan can round up enough votes to pull out a narrow victory . But that certainly would not end the budget battle . Approval of the general outlines of a spending plan would still leave the details subject to a flock of amendments in the Senate , to say nothing of the antagonistic reception the budget resolution is sure to get in the Democratic-controlled House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social Security benefits , to abolish 17 federal programs and to increase military outlays 3% above the estimated rate of inflation will all come under fierce attack , which will be even sharper if the overall budget package can not squeak through the G.O.P.-controlled Senate . " If we lose , we start the demolition derby , " says Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole . Even if the broad budget package passes , he adds , " maybe it will be a demolition derby anyway . " <P> Reagan 's chances of winning the budget struggle have not been enhanced by last week 's reverses . The uproar over Bitburg seems to be perceptibly , if perhaps temporarily , lowering the President 's popularity . In a Washington Post-ABC News poll published last week , 52% of respondents wished Reagan would cancel his visit to the Bitburg cemetery , which contains the graves of 2,000 German soldiers , most of them killed during World War II , including 49 members of the Waffen SS , the combat branch of Hitler 's murderous elite guard . Reagan 's overall job-approval rating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late March and a dazzling 68% in January .
