 | Bewildered by IBM 's announcement of four new personal computers and Microsoft 's promise of a new computer-operating system next year for them ? Do n't feel alone . Even Bill Gates , Microsoft 's chairman , admits that in the computer business " this is going to be the year of confusion . " But the news for individuals and small-business users ? as well as for corporate buyers ? is good . You have more opportunities to purchase just what you need . Prices are dropping . The new computers , IBM 's along with the inevitable clones , will be more powerful and easier to use . You may even be able to add some of the new features to your present computer . Most important to those outside of big business , IBM 's new bottom-of-the-line Model 30 follows the style of the personal computers the company introduced in 1981 . It uses a later version of Microsoft 's present operating system ( MS-DOS ) , and thus runs all the same word-processing , spreadsheet and other programs as the originals . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer for years . " We expect that a lot of smaller buyers will stay with the classic product , " says Enzo Torresi , senior vice president for the Businessland chain of computer stores . Because the Model 30 offers superior graphic displays and more speed than current IBM compatibles , prices for the clones and the older IBM 's are going to drop , retailers say . A Model 30 with two disc drives and a monochrome screen lists for $1,945 , but shoppers already can find it at major stores for less than $1,700 . What you get for your money That 's still well above the price for a similarly equipped clone of the existing IBM PC . The Epson Equity I , with two disc drives , 640 kilobytes of memory and a screen , can be bought for less than $700 . The price for the Leading Edge Model D , with its word-processing program , was recently cut $120 , to $1,175 . The Kaypro runs about $1,300 and Tandy 's 1000SX with 640K goes for $1,298 . A hard disc , which multiplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the price of most compatibles , $600 to the Model 30 . Many computer buyers can find all the speed and power they need in a current compatible or an older IBM . A computer , after all , is just a machine to A survival manual for the new PC 's run software . The WordPerfect 4.2 word-processing program or the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet program works the same on a compatible as on a Model 30 , though perhaps slower . IBM 's adoption of 3.5-inch disc drives for its new machines ? they store more data than 5.25-inch discs in its present PC 's ? should not scare anyone . Software vendors say they will sell IBM 's top-of-the-line personal computers get a new look next year , and guess what : Their screens will appear similar to Apple 's popular Macintosh . The new " user interface , " part of Microsoft 's Operating System/2 , has color graphics , pull-down menus and overlapping windows , all to make complex programs easier to learn and run . You can even use a mouse . their programs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs from a machine with 5.25-inch drives to one with the smaller discs . The biggest changes are coming at the high end of the market with IBM 's powerful Models 50 , 60 , and 80 , designed to work with Microsoft 's new Operating System/2 . The operating system will take full advantage of the Intel 80286 and 80386 microprocessors IBM is using in its three top personal computers . Though OS/2 wo n't be available until next year , and new programs written for it wo n't come till after that , the combination sets the course for advanced IBM personal computers into the 1990s . Until then , the new IBM 's can run under the same DOS used in Model 30 . OS/2 will allow programs to use up to 16 megabytes of memory , far beyond the 640-kilobyte limit of DOS . More than one program can run simultaneously . The computer screen will have menus of commands that can be pulled down from the top of the screen like an old-fashioned shade and the capability to display more than one program at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macintosh , making complex programs easier to use . You 'll take the same steps to retrieve files from a disc , for example , whether you 're processing words or running a data-base-management program . Even though IBM Models 50 , 60 and 80 employ a new structure for moving data , which clone makers are scrambling to emulate , OS/2 also will be available to those who have already invested in current-generation computers that are driven by the more powerful Intel chips , like the IBM AT or Compaq 386 . IBM says that at least 1.5 megabytes of memory will be required in an AT to run OS/2 . It may even be possible to soup up your old IBM PC , XT or compatible to take advantage of OS/2 . Quadram says it will market a $1,495 circuit board containing an 80386 chip and three megabytes of memory that can be plugged into an old machine to do the trick , though it wo n't be quite as fast as a Model 80 . Several other board makers are expected to do the same , and Businessland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upgrade older IBM and compatible computers with these products . Microsoft warns that add-on circuit boards will have to adhere to its standards in order for OS/2 to work properly . Buy now ? With the offerings of IBM , the clone makers and Apple , the personal-computer market has never before offered so much for so little . If you wait until prices fall substantially , you will continue to wait ? in this business , falling prices for a given level of performance has always been the norm .
