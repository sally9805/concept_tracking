Sunday school may have taught them the words of the Gospels , but for millions of children , Hollywood provided the pictures . They were pretty pictures : stained glass in motion , from the First Church of DeMille . Handsome men  --  their beards neatly curled and trimmed , their robes immaculate  --  trod on tiptoe through a Judaea as verdant and manicured as Forest Lawn . They may have represented Israelites of two millenniums past , but they often looked Nordic ; God must have had blue eyes . And they spoke the King 's English : King James ' , with an assist from any screenwriter willing to gussy up his fustian . In these prim tones , the heart 's revolution that Jesus preached became an Oxford don 's lecture , and his ghastly , redemptive death a tableau painted on velvet . <P> Martin Scorsese 's first achievement in The Last Temptation of Christ is to strip the biblical epic of its encrusted sanctimony and show biz . He has re- created  --  in Morocco , and on a pinchpenny budget of $6.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It takes hard men to work this holy land , men who labor under the twin burdens of poverty and occupying oppression . Their clothes are dirt-dry and sweat-drenched . Their faces , most of them , boast Semitic heritage ; their voices hold the raspy , urgent cadences of Brooklyn , Appalachia and other frontier outposts of working-class America . ( Only Satan and the Romans speak with British accents . ) By jolting the viewer to reconsider Hollywood 's calcified stereotypes of the New Testament , Scorsese wants to restore the immediacy of that time , the stern wonder of that land , the thrilling threat of meeting the Messiah on the mean streets of Jerusalem . <P> Scorsese is America 's most gifted , most daring moviemaker . His style is impatient , intimate , conspiratorial , the camera scurrying ever closer to the heart of the matter  --  X rays of souls in stress . His films are also , thematically , the same film . In Mean Streets and Raging Bull , The King of Comedy and The Color of Money , he has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound by love or hate ; one must betray the other and thereby help certify his mission . In the Nikos Kazantzakis novel and Paul Schrader 's script , Scorsese has found a story vibrant with melodrama and metaphor . This Jesus ( Willem Dafoe ) is not God born as man . He is a man who discovers  --  or invents  --  his own divinity . And he is both tormented and excited by the revelation . This Judas ( Harvey Keitel ) is a strong , loving activist . He wants to overthrow the Roman occupiers , while Jesus wants freedom for the soul . To fulfill his covenant , Judas must betray not Jesus but his own ideal of revolution . He must hand the man he most loves over to the Romans . <P> Any Jesus film with sex and violence is bound to roil the faithful . For Scorsese , though , these elements are bold colors on the canvas , images of the life Jesus must renounce and redeem . The sex scene ( in which Barbara Hershey 's Mary Magdalene entertains some customers ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her flesh . And the film 's carnage is emetic , not exploitative . The crowning with thorns , the scourging at the pillar , the agonized trudge up Calvary show what Jesus suffered and why . Dafoe 's spiky , ferocious , nearly heroic performance is a perfect servant to the role . He finds sense in Jesus ' agonies ; he finds passion in the parables .
