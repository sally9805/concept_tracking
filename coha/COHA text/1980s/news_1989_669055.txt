In the ephemeral world of popular culture , 10 years is a century . By then , most pop phenomena have withered on and fallen off the vine , victims of an American attention span only slightly longer than the shelf life of milk . Remember Pop Rocks ? Pet Rocks ? American Motors ' Pacer ? But another pop prodigy has managed not only to cling to the vine , but to climb it . The portable personal stereo , introduced by Sony-and now known , no matter what the brand , by Sony ' s duly registered trade name , the Walkman-turned 10 this year . And while the knee-jerk commemoration of anniversaries is something of a journalistic cancer , this round-number birthday ( which the company energetically celebrated the other day ) merits at least a mention . In the last decade , Walkmans ( using the term both specifically and generically ) have become a ubiquitous part of the culture : in schools , on commuter trains , on city streets , even in the workplace . Sony alone has sold 25 million of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the company . From the one model proferred 10 years ago , Sony ' s product line has grown to the 44 available this year , in various permutations of radio , cassette player and cassette recorder . There are now Walkmans designed specifically for sports , Walkmans that play compact discs ( Discman ) , and a colorful line of portables for kids-dubbed My First Sony-that wouldn ' t look out of place in a Fisher-Price catalogue , although the technology is on a somewhat higher level . Many other manufacturers , most notably Aiwa , are in the market , too , but Sony " dominates , " racking up about half of all portable sales , according to Shelley Miller , president of United Audio Centers , the Chicago retail chain . " If it wasn ' t for Sony , nothing would be happening that ' s happening today , " he says . Miller credits Walkmans , which have brought together the rare combination of affordability , quality and good design , with turning on hordes of new people to quality sound-making buyers of topnotch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contented life listening to lacerated records on spasmodic turntables equipped with dust-crusted needles . " It ' s expanded the audio business tremendously , " he says . Others have given Walkmans ( Walkmen ? ) credit for helping to create the books-on-tape boom . They unquestionably played a key role in the introduction of cassette singles and the general rise in sales and quality of prerecorded cassettes over the last 10 years . And parents who suffered through years of stereo wars among their progeny can testify to the change in their blood pressure brought about by Walkmans : Suddenly , House of the Dueling Heavy Metal Titans was transformed into Garden of the Headphone-Wearing Teens-and ( not infrequently ) Adults . In this time , the product has managed to weather a period of Walkman backlash , in which it was criticized as being dangerous both to the wearer ( it blocks out warning noises , can hurt ear drums , and creates an obvious target for muggers ) and to society ( it symbolizes a growing selfishness , a sign that people are interested less in human intercourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also managed to surmount a problem of attitude on the part of some who were supposed to sell them . " When they came out , I was a snotty hi-fi salesman , " says Tim Errington . " I didn ' t think they would sell . " Errington is now a Sony vice president . Partymen Sony is so proud of its product ' s impact that the company , in its promotional hype for the anniversary , is attempting to christen the product ' s lifespan , " The Walkman Decade . " It ' s a nice try . Nonetheless , in that and other ways , Sony has kept its PR button on fast-forward for most of this year . After a summer that included Walkman giveaways and the design , with Tiffany &; Co. , of a limited-edition , silver-plated Walkman , the celebration culminated last week in a party thrown mostly for Sony dealers and held simultaneously in six cities , at six Hard Rock Cafes ( another ' 80s phenomenon that shows signs of having some legs ) . Local deejays hosted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stroud offered such exhortations as " Stick around . Party up . Party down , " and " I want your fundials not at 5 , not at 7 , but I want your fundials turned up to 10 here ! " The party featured a live , closed-circuit video broadcast from the New York Hard Rock , hosted by hired guns Dick Clark and Robert Klein , and featuring music from David Letterman sidekick Paul Shaffer and his , allegedly , World ' s Most Dangerous Band . The narrowcast offered video and musical retrospectives of the last 10 years and a heap of warmed-over awards-show-style Clark-Klein crosstalk . Sony also solicited a round of taped testimonials from a cross-section of celebrities . Pro wrestler Hulk Hogan said he packs a Walkman alongside his championship belt " just so I have good tunes wherever I go . " Pioneering shock rocker Alice Cooper , now on the comeback trail , revealed that " I ' m actually made by Sony myself . " CBS morning host Kathleen Sullivan joked , probably , that " it ' s been good company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first marriage . " Charles Osgood , Peter Max , Tracy Austin , Bob Costas , and Brent Musburger and Irv Cross were among the others offering their congrats , all at no cost to Sony , according to company PR representatives . And Klein not only did yet another rendition of his classic " I Can ' t Stop My Leg " blues routine ( featuring the refrain , " If I ' m Jewish , baby/Why do I sing like this ? " ) , but he offered the observation that " my career was measured in the diminution in size of tape recording devices . " Diminution , of course , is the key to the Walkman ' s appeal . " It allows the listener to create an ocean of tranquility in a sea of noise and chaos , " Sony Corp. of America President and Chief Operating Officer Neil Vander Dussen said from the New York stage . Shaffer , forgoing his usual Vegas lounge schtick in favor of wild overstatement , compared the listener ' s first experience with a Walkman to that of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " For all the hipness on the screens , though , it was , at least in Chicago , very much a business party : besuited stereo retailers , eating and drinking on the big account . " We enjoy selling Sony products , " said one vendor , presented with one of the silver-plated Walkmans by the company . " A diverse cross-section of Chicago ' s retailing market . " " Fabulous people person . " " Taking a rare evening off before opening one of his newest locations . " " Sales growth and profitability growth . " " Separate the men from the boys . " Etc . Soundabout ' didn ' t sing Hard Rock , meanwhile , inducted onto its famous-guitar-dotted walls-the closest thing the country has to a rock hall of fame , at least until the official one in Cleveland finally gets a building-a model of the first Sony Walkman , the $200 TPS-L2 , which stands for tape player stereo listener 2 . It ' s not clear what happened to listener No. 1 , but the rest of L2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first marketed in the United States as the " Soundabout , " because Sony America folks thought " Walkman , " the named used in Japan , wasn ' t good English ; how the United Kingdom , also objecting to the hybrid word , used " Stowaway " and Sweden " Freestyle " ; and how Chairman Akio Morita , seeing how the word " Walkman " was catching on in non-English-speaking countries , quickly decreed that the Japanese name would reign . " Now , " a beaming Morita said during the telecast , " the Oxford English Dictionary has Walkman . " ' CAPTION : PHOTO : The pioneering TPS-L2 Walkman . In 10 years , 50 million sold .
