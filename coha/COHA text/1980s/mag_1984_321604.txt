Officially , it was described as " a bad cold . " But feverish imaginations in the world press soon produced far more colorful explanations for Soviet President Yuri Andropov 's total disappearance from public life last August : he had been shot by Leonid Brezhnev 's son , he was suffering from Parkinson 's disease , he had had a stroke , he was recovering-or not recovering-from kidney transplant surgery . What actually happened to Andropov is much less melodramatic and far more logical . Here are the details of his recent medical history , as assembled by TIME from authorities in the U.S. and abroad : <P> The first medically important fact about the patient was his age at the time of death : 69 , seven years beyond the average life expectancy for Soviet males . Andropov had suffered a heart attack about 20 years ago and , like nearly 10% of people over 65 , he had diabetes . The combination of cardiovascular disease and diabetes made him a high-risk candidate for kidney trouble , and he was suffering from kidney problems when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his kidney function had become so poor that he started treatment on a dialysis machine . <P> Andropov 's doctors were extremely sophisticated in treating cardiac and renal disorders . Despite recent reports , it was all but unthinkable that they would have even seriously considered , much less performed , a kidney transplant . The Soviet leader 's age , diabetes and heart disease would have made the procedure far too risky . Instead , Andropov received increasing dialysis treatments , at first two or three times a week and eventually every other day . The treatments took place in a sanitarium near Moscow and also at a southern resort . This therapy and the successful control of complications caused by infection permitted him to resume all of his official activities late last spring after a 1-month absence . By July he was embarked on a program of exercise and swimming to rebuild his strength and was preparing for an official visit to Bulgaria . <P> But Andropov 's progress was halted sharply when he reportedly developed a form of leg ulcers common to diabetic patients of his age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ulcers heal , their patient had to stay off his feet . But to regain muscular strength , much diminished by illness and confinement , he needed physical activity . The physical activity was also vital because his circulation needed to be improved in order to make the dialysis more effective . Low blood pressure hampers dialysis . <P> The various symptoms Andropov displayed during his last appearances in public in mid-August-trembling hands , uneven gait , difficulty in getting out of his chair-were caused by muscle weakness brought on by diabetes and the kidney problems . The stiffness that observers detected in the Soviet leader 's left arm was due to the repeated use of that arm for dialysis . <P> Andropov 's ailments also made him unusually susceptible to infections and colds , which can easily develop into pneumonia in such patients . Medical concern about exposure to infectious agents was one reason for the Soviet President 's absence from public meetings . His personal outside contacts were probably limited to close associates and Politburo members .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
