 | A decade ago , at the age of 31 , University of Chicago theologian David Tracy set out to do the seemingly impossible ? to digest , interpret and carry forward the whole of contemporary theology . He got off to a good start . In his widely praised 1975 book , " Blessed Rage for Order , " Tracy laid out the philosophical foundations on which , he argued , contemporary theologians could demonstrate the cogency of religious faith to believers and nonbelievers alike . Now , in " The Analogical Imagination , " * Tracy has plunged into the rich pluralism of modern religion ? and come up with a daring theological strategy by which each major religious tradition can articulate its claim to religious truth . The key to Tracy 's long and complex work is his reworking of the concept of religious tradition . In Tracy 's view , every religious tradition is shaped by its " classics " ? that is , events , actions , texts or works of art in which people express themselves in a manner that has universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it can never be exhausted by reinterpretation . In fact , it lives by reinterpretation , commanding the attention of subsequent generation and setting standards by which they judge themselves and their times . Crucial Events : The classics of any religious tradition , Tracy explains , begin with the founding figures ( Abraham , Jesus , Buddha ) , events ( the Exodus , the Crucifixion ) and scriptures ( the Bible , the Veda , the Koran ) . But they also encompass secondary texts ( Calvin 's Institutes ) , symbols ( the Cross ) and rituals ( the Mass ) that have acquired interpretive status of their own . Applying his theory to Christianity , Tracy argues that the essence of that tradition is " God 's self-manifestation in the person of Jesus Christ as witnessed by the New Testament . " But even the New Testament itself , he observes , contains diverse interpretations of Jesus by Saint Paul and the Gospel writers . In turn , Saint Paul 's theology itself has been variously interpreted by Christian classics written in response to crucial events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a church facing the dissolution of the Roman Empire ; later , Luther reinterpreted Pauline theology for a Christendom ripe for reformation ; and most recently , Karl Barth 's epochal commentary on Paul 's Epistle to the Romans provided Protestants with a neo-orthodoxy for an age ravaged by World War I. The implications of Tracy 's theory are far ranging . For one thing , he transfers the burden of religious authority from hierarchs , who demand obedience , to classics that solicit understanding . " Authoritarians who insist that theologians merely defend approved doctrines , " he says , " violate both the consciences of scholars and the interpretive nature of tradition itself . " He also reconnects theology with the arts and the humanities : all forms of human culture are potential sources of theological insight . ( Among the classics of his own Roman Catholic tradition , Tracy includes the art of Michelangelo , Dante 's " Divine Comedy " and the Latin hymn " Panis Angelicus . " ) Finally , Tracy rescues tradition from the dead hand of the past by animating it with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every living faith . It is not just intellectuals who pose important questions for religious traditions , he points out . " The Holocaust challenges both Christian and Jewish traditions , " he says , " and so does the massive suffering of today 's refugees in Africa and Asia . Theologians must ask themselves , like Job , how can these things be ? " Tracy insists that modern theology must be a cooperative venture , and his book demonstrates how a single gifted theologian can absorb and illuminate the work of others . A specialist in hermeneutics , or theories of interpretation , Tracy has produced a miniature library of learned exegeses : " The Analogical Imagination " ranges from Aristotle to Augustine , from Freud , Marx and Nietzsche to contemporary textual deconstructionist Jacques Derrida . Even his footnotes have footnotes . At 42 Tracy is just emerging into international prominence . Educated at Catholic seminaries in New York and Rome , he served a pastoral stint at a singularly conservative church in Stamford , Conn . It was an odd match-up . Asked by the parish men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded with a lecture on the Christian-Marxist dialogue in Europe . In 1968 he was among twenty teachers at Washington 's Catholic University of America put on trial by the university ? and exonerated the next year ? for publicly criticizing " Humanae Vitae , " Pope Paul VI 's encyclical condemning birth control . He then became the first Catholic priest to be appointed to the faculty of the University of Chicago Divinity School , where he has since quietly matched the brilliance of such senior colleagues as philosopher Paul Ricoeurand historian Mircea Eliade . Links : Tracy is already outlining a third volume , one that will directly address society in the way that his earlier book addressed the academy and " The Analogical Imagination " speaks to churches . His work is unlikely to attain much of a lay readership until Tracy learns to simplify his nuanced style and to focus his considerable analytic powers on a single subject . Nonetheless he has already proven his main point ? that theology can not only stretch across different religious traditions , but also link the worlds of religion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
