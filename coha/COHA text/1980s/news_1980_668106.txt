The dark clouds linger around him , but then Fred Lynn has never really paid much attention to storm warnings . He is a gifted hitter , and he does give his best , regardless of what some people say to the contrary . " The only thing I can say about Fred Lynn is that he might have had five home runs tonight , " said Red Sox manager Don Zimmer . " He had five home-run swings . " Yet , before the Red Sox bounced back for a 7-0 victory after a 2- 1 loss to Reggie Cleveland and the Milwaukee Brewers in a twi-night doubleheader last night at County Stadium , there had been a hint of confrontation between these two men . Between games , Lynn had tried to inject some humor when it was announced that Carlton Fisk would be playing beside him in left . " Are you trying to wear me out ? " asked Lynn , referring to Fisk ' s being used in the outfield . Only Zimmer didn ' t think the line was very funny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play ? " he asked . Lynn , realizing the situation could become a volatile one , kept smiling and kept the conversation light . The thing the rest did for me is that it helped my batting stroke . . . I was swinging good tonight . Just like I had last year ' s stroke . ' " I ' m just wondering if anybody has a peach basket for Fisk , if he ' s going to be out there next to me , " said Lynn . By the time Lynn had finished , Zimmer had regained his composure and talked about one of his best pitchers , Mike Fred Lynn , who has more than once been accused of marching to his own drummer , regardless of how it affects the Red Sox . Last night , Lynn ended up answering the bell for the nightcap by hitting two home runs and driving in four runs . Yes , he did miss the five games prior to the All-Star break but flew to Los Angeles and played . Yes , he did do it because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the All-Star game . But that doesn ' t necessarily mean he takes his role with the Red Sox lightly or would risk injury in such a contest at a time when the club needs every able-bodied player it can muster . " I ' ve never had a pulled hamstring , so I ' m really not quite sure what to do , " said Lynn . " It comes and it goes . Tonight , it was hot and it actually got loose as the game went along . There was one short fly ball that Rooster ( Rick Burleson ) caught in the seventh inning of the second game that I had to run a long way for , and I didn ' t feel anything at all . " Lynn said his All-Star break was a rest stop since he didn ' t have to extend himself running and his hitting improved after he took batting practice Monday for the first time this week . " The thing the rest did for me is that it helped my batting stroke , " said Lynn . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year ' s stroke . " His two-run homer in the All-Star Game created the wrong vibes among his teammates , who were critical that he played at all . But despite those vibes , Lynn showed his stuff in both games . He hit three long shots off Brewer pitching in the second game . The first , off Lary Sorenson , went into the right-field seats at the 362 sign . The second , off John Flinn , was caught at the center-field wall , 402 feet away , and the third , off Bill Castro , carried into the centerfield seats . " But I had two better swings against Cleveland , " Lynn said . " The last two times up I had home-run cuts , but I hit under the ball instead of flush and popped both of them into the air . You could tell that everybody was just a little bit rusty and off by a hair in that first game . " The rest ' seemed to help my hitting mostly . I still can ' t run full . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to go down and get a ball and that caused me to stretch . The second one , however , was easy because the ball was up and I knew it was gone as soon as I hit it . " The controversy surrounding Fred Lynn died down as soon as he showed his old form . He shook hands in the dugout on both home runs and after his sacrifice fly in the sixth . Greater love hath no teammate .
