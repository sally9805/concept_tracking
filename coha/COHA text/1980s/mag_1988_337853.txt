Where does the world 's foremost designer of high-speed computers get his inspiration ? Apparently deep in a dirt tunnel beneath his Wisconsin home , according to John Rollwagen , the chairman of Cray Research . As Rollwagen tells it , Seymour Cray , the company 's elusive founder , has been dividing his time between building the next generation of supercomputers and digging an underground tunnel that starts below his Chippewa Falls house and heads toward the nearby woods . " He 's been working at it for some time now , " says Rollwagen , who reports that the tunnel is 8 ft. high , 4 ft. wide and lined with 4-by-4 cedar boards . When a tree fell through the top of the tunnel several years ago , Cray used the opening to install a periscope-equipped lookout . <P> For Cray , the excavation project is more than a simple diversion . " I work when I 'm at home , " he recently told a visiting scientist . " I work for three hours , and then I get stumped , and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and work in the tunnel . It takes me an hour or so to dig four inches and put in the 4-by-4s . Now , as you can see , I 'm up in the Wisconsin woods , and there are elves in the woods . So when they see me leave , they come into my office and solve all the problems I 'm having . Then I go back up and work some more . " <P> Rollwagen knows that Cray is only half kidding and that some of the designer 's greatest inspirations come when he is digging . Says the chairman : " The real work happens when Seymour is in the tunnel . "
