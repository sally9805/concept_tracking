But for Jay Johnson , 24 , crossing the finish line in British Columbia in a race with himself , the 10,000 mile trip in 476 days was worth it . He says his one-of-a-kind foot , boat and bicycle odyssey will now occupy him for a second year : he plans to write two books about it , one for adults , one for children . The idea for the trip came to him while he was a senior at Cornell University in New York.When he was graduated from college in 1980 , he spent a year working to earn money for the trip . " I was a supervisor for a pest control company , a supervisor for a maintenance firm , a security guard part-time and worked for Hood ' s sail makers in Marblehead . I earned $8000 to $10,000 , enough for the trip , " he said . He started on June 6 , 1981 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the Appalachian Trail begins . He completed his journey 16 months later - Sept. 25 , 1982 - at Manning Provincial Park in British Columbia . Why would a 23-year-old want to make a trip like that ? " I had many reasons , " said Johnson in a recent interview at his home . " To show others what you can do if you put your mind to it . " To prove to myself that I can do what I think I can do . To challenge myself physically in keeping up with my schedule . " To say that I ' ve accomplished something worth noting in my life . To give me more confidence in doing other things in the future . " To set me apart and make me more of an individual . To see and explore the wild areas of the United States . " From Mt . Katahdin he headed out over the Appalachian Trail , 2100 miles south to Springer Mt . in Georgia ; south through the Talladega Mountains to Montgomery , Alabama . " When I first started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big blisters on my feet . My feet were so sore , " he said . After four months and 2400 miles , he traded in shoes for a boat and took off down the Alabama River to the Gulf of Mexico . He continued rowing along the Gulf Coast via the Intercoastal Waterway through the bayous of the Mississippi Delta , past the barrier islands off the coast of Texas to Brownsville . " The boat was a 15-foot , fiberglass rowing dory , made in Marblehead . I had to make the packing crate myself and my parents had it trucked out to me in Alabama , " Johnson said . Navigating the Gulf Coast " was hairy , " he said . " There were 10- foot waves and a wild current . It nearly swamped the boat a couple of times . It was dangerous and exciting . " Next he traded in the boat for a bicycle and began a 3000-mile jaunt through Texas , New Mexico , Colorado , Utah , Arizona and California . The bike trip ended in southern California and he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north through California , Oregon and Washington , 2600 miles to British Columbia . Johnson took a train to Montreal and flew to Boston , resting up for the four days it took , before meeting his parents at Logan Airport . Johnson said he averaged between 17 and 25 miles a day while on foot , 20 miles a day while in the boat and 80 to 90 miles a day while on the bicycle . His food came to him in packages sent by his parents to predetermined post offices along his route . Johnson stands 5 feet , 11 inches , has blond hair , blue eyes and a mustache . He weighed in at 185 when he started , 145 when he finished . He said the most beautiful spot he encountered was the Alabama River . " I ' d like to go back there . It ' s a beautiful place . There are unusual large trees covered with Spanish moss . " The wildlife there is spectacular , " he said . " Herons , egrets , deer , beaver , armadillos and paddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Tennessee , with an old Indian - a full-blooded Winnebago - " who lives in the outdoors and has no home . He ' s really got it together . " Johnson plans to put in a year writing his books . He ' s not a professional writer , but in his writing courses in college his marks were good , near the top of the class . He has a philosophy of positive thinking . " I was able to do the whole tripbecause I always felt confident I could do it . You have to find in yourself what you do best and go to the ultimate . " I think most people could do more than they ' re actually doing . They ' re limited by what other people are doing . It ' s harder to be an individual today . If you believe you can do something , you can do it . That ' s going to be the point of my book . " Johnson said he hasn ' t come across any trips as ambitious as his . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-country walkers , he says , " stayed with people overnight . I camped out , under the stars , most of the time without a tent . The only times I used a tent was when it was raining or the mosquitoes were heavy . "
