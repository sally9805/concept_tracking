As every cook knows , tinkering with a favorite recipe can bring grunts of disapproval from family and friends . For a food company , such tampering invites an even greater disaster : plummeting sales . Today , though , food manufacturers are busily reformulating some of their most popular products . Early this month , Keebler became the fourth major company since last fall  --  joining Pepperidge Farm , Kellogg and Sunshine Biscuits  --  to announce a switch in ingredients . The change : replacing highly saturated tropical oils with less saturated fats . <P> The move , which affects such items as Kellogg 's Cracklin ' Oat Bran cereal , Keebler 's Soft Batch cookies , Pepperidge Farm 's Goldfish crackers and Sunshine 's Hydrox cookies , is prompted by health considerations  --  and rising consumer pressure . Manufacturers have long been partial to the balmy-sounding vegetable oils  --  coconut , palm-kernel and palm  --  mainly because they impart a nongreasy taste and texture and extend the shelf life of products . But they are also high in saturated fat , the prime booster of blood-cholesterol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil 86% and palm oil 51% . In comparison , the damaging fat makes up only 27% of cottonseed oil , 15% of soybean oil and 13% of corn oil . <P> Consumer advocates have been campaigning in recent years to get companies to eliminate tropical oils . Last fall Phil Sokolof , founder of the National Heart Savers Association , fired the strongest salvo yet in the ongoing battle . He began placing full-page ads in leading newspapers lambasting U.S. food processors for " the Poisoning of America " and featuring photos of their offending products . Sokolof , 66 , a building-materials manufacturer in Omaha who suffered a heart attack 22 years ago , has spent $2 million so far on his crusade . Says he : " People feel like they have been deceived by the food companies . " Sokolof points out that Procter &; Gamble 's Crisco is touted as having no cholesterol , but it contains palm oil . <P> Although many of the manufacturers targeted by Sokolof are revising their products , they all insist that the changes were long in the works . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which in December began replacing the coconut oil in its Cracklin ' Oat Bran cereal with a blend of cottonseed and soybean oil : " It would be impossible to do the R. and D. and change our ingredients overnight . " But he concedes that " Mr. Sokolof did create a sense of urgency for us to move faster . " <P> Some scientists think the public has become overanxious . " The tropical oil issue is growing out of proportion , " declares Basil Rifkind , a cholesterol researcher at the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute . Roughly 15% of the calories in Americans ' diets now come from saturated fats . And tropical oils supply only about a fourteenth of that amount . Americans might better worry about cutting back on the two biggest sources of saturated fat : meat and dairy products .
