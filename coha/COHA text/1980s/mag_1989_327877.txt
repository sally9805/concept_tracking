Outside , carnival celebrations were reaching their climax . But inside a Sao Paulo municipal lockup , policemen were exacting savage revenge for a failed ! escape attempt . They stripped naked 51 prisoners , allegedly beat them , then crushed them into an unventilated 5-ft. by 10-ft. cell . Whether the prisoners were locked in for 70 minutes or four hours remains a matter of dispute . What is not is that when the door was opened , nine were dead of suffocation and another nine died shortly after being rushed to the hospital . <P> That barbaric incident only spotlighted Brazil 's long history of police brutality . It is caused in part by a tradition of contempt toward offenders , and is compounded by a growing crime rate that has frightened many well-off Brazilians into indifference toward conditions in the country 's overcrowded prisons . According to local records , 112 criminal suspects have died in police custody since 1982.
