High-tech companies encounter the hardest truths of the marketplace <P> To outsiders , California 's Silicon Valley looks like a contemporary El Dorado . Once given over to fruit orchards , its 150 sq . mi. in Santa Clara County are home to some of America 's most successful and innovative companies , including Hewlett-Packard , Intel and Apple Computer . Hundreds of other high-technology firms are trying to mimic their success . While the vast majority have prospered , quite a few are now discovering that not all the streets in the valley are paved with profits . For them , the earlier dreams of success and overnight riches have crumbled . <P> The problems that such companies face reflect recent dramatic changes in the marketplace for high technology . In particular , the demand for personal computers and computer software is turning out to be far weaker than numerous companies had supposed . Sales of computers and software are now expected to grow only 28% a year until 1989 , according to InfoCorp , a San Jose market-research firm . That is a robust rate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley 's optimistic entrepreneurs , who were hoping for annual growth of more than 50% .

As the number of personal-computer companies grew from a handful five years ago to more than 180 today , competition became ferocious . Except for a few leaders , the firms are scrambling for shelf space in stores at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quips Fred Hoar , a former Apple executive and now vice president of Raychem , a specialty chemical company : " The personal-computer industry has reached a new chapter in its history : Chapter 11 . " <P> The marketplace is full of ailing companies . Gavilan Computer in Campbell raised $23.9 million in venture capital two years ago to help launch its first product , a 9-lb. lap-size computer , but was slow to develop an improved model . It has laid off 210 of its 280 workers , and is now looking for additional capital . Convergent Technologies has also stumbled over its portable . The Santa Clara firm introduced its lap-size WorkSlate a year ago to enthusiastic reviews . But the company could not make enough of these computers to satisfy the initial demand , and then ran into production snafus . After losing $6.5 million in the second quarter , it announced that it would stop making the WorkSlate and concentrate on its original line of products : desktop office computers .                @ @ @ @ @
