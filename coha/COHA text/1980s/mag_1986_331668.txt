Nearly everyone who has ever had to choose between two attractive jobs has yearned , at least for a moment , to take them both . Adrian Hall actually did it . When the Dallas Theater Center asked him three years ago to become its artistic director , Hall said he would come only if he could also continue to run Trinity Repertory in Providence , which he founded in 1964 . Now , like Persephone in the Greek myth , Hall spends half the year in a sun-baked Texas financial center and the other half in a gray , run-down , working-class corner of Rhode Island , 1,520 miles away . He is no figurehead in either place . While many artistic directors limit themselves to the hands-on staging of one show a year , Hall is mounting two this season in Providence and two more in Dallas , one of which opened last week . His bawdy , confrontational work at Trinity got him fired , temporarily , in the mid- ' 70s but won a special Tony Award in 1981 and just keeps rolling along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garde impact on a stodgy company has cost more than a third of the subscribers , his work is just beginning . <P> Within his profession , Hall , 58 , is a revered , almost legendary figure , esteemed both for the brilliance of his productions and for his odds-defying , inspirational leadership , but to most of the theatergoing public he is unknown . He chose , in the early stages of a promising career , to abandon commercial theater for the then nascent regional repertory movement . Says he : " I always hated the pickup quality of commercial theater , where the only permanent people were the managers and the accountants . I thought the theater should be built around the artists , and I always looked to find my sense of family there . " In Providence , Hall gathered an ensemble whose members remained season after season . Their loyalty proved vital during the showdown with the Trinity board , which had grown impatient with his explicitly erotic work , especially an adaptation of the James Purdy novel Eustace Chisholm and the Works that featured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board ousted him , the actors boycotted and led a community protest . The upshot was that Hall " fired " the board , replacing them with backers of his vision . <P> Growing up in the farm country of Van ( pop . 610 ) , 80 miles from Dallas , Hall realized early that he would not become a rancher , like his father , or a preacher , as his mother hoped . He was willowy , almost too handsome , sensitive and shy . Says he : " I was called ' sister-boy ' more than once . " He played the trombone in the high school band to avoid sports and was president of the square dance club . After working his way through East Texas State University by teaching high school drama in Galveston , he moved to New York City in 1955 . He staged a revival of Tennessee Williams ' Orpheus Descending and became a friend and protege of Williams ' , and later of Robert Penn Warren 's and William Styron 's .
