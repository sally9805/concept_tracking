Francis P. Rich , a successful small businessman from Saugus , says he ' s not running a political race for governor , he ' s running a marketing campaign . While politicians generally try to play down the fact that political candidates these days are packaged and sold like toothpaste , Rich readily admits it . Only he prefers a comparison with shaving cream . " Remember the old Burma Shave signs ? " he asked in a recent interview in his combination business-campaign headquarters in East Boston . " Great marketing strategy . I believe in it . " So , like the now legendary red-and-white signs bearing Burma Shave sales messages in verse , " Rich for Governor " signs are strung up along streets and highways throughout the state . There are parts of Boston where there hardly seems to be a utility pole without one of Rich ' s ubiquitous signs attached to it . For months now , the Rich campaign has been churning out thousands of small plastic shields with a magnet on the back that carry the legend , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Our Next Governor . " They are meant to be attached to anything metal - a refrigerator , a stove , a desk , a word processor - like ready-made graffiti . Rich ' s campaign has been operating on a financial shoestring , so his marketing strategy has yet to include a televised commercial . He has collected only a little more than $75,000 in political contributions , $5000 of it his own money . By comparison , Gov . Edward J. King spent $3.4 million on his unsuccessful primary campaign and the Democratic nominee , Michael S. Dukakis , spent $2.4 million . Rich , who characterizes himself as a " compassionate conservative , " believes in simple and frugal approaches . This is reflected in the ambience of his austere company offices , located in a plain wooden building on Condor street in a residential neighborhood in East Boston hard by the Chelsea Creek . There , with a small staff , he operates the Logan Equipment Co. , a construction equipment rental firm , as well as a real estate business and other interests . Downstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rich-Governor " signs . There is the same flavor to his political philosophy and his concept of what government is all about . Frank Rich doesn ' t trust politicians . He says things like " Call me any dirty name you think of , but never call me a politician . " And his biggest qualification for governor , he says , " is my lack of political experience . " Until he decided to run for governor himself , his only experience in politics had been four years ago , when he supported King , a friend since their boyhood days together in East Boston , in his successful campaign to topple then-Gov . Dukakis . Rich was one of King ' s principal supporters and fund- raisers during the 1978 campaign . Today , Rich believes that King betrayed him and the voters after he got into office , that he abandoned his nonpolitical cadre of advisers and allowed himself to be surrounded by " politicians , " a word the 56-year-old Rich spits out like a curse . According to Rich , King ' s major failure was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million property tax rollback in his first year of office . From there , he says , it was all downhill . " Gov . King turned a can-do campaign into a can ' t-do administration , " Rich says repeatedly . Now , Rich says , he has picked up the banner . Short , silver-haired and slightly paunchy , the 56-year-old Rich is the first Independent candidate to appear on the ballot in more than 50 years , a feat he accomplished by collecting more than 40,000 certified voter signatures . " I spurned the Democrat and Republican parties , or syndicates , because I represent the voter-taxpayers of this state , " says Rich . To get his message to the voter-taxpayers , Rich has been crisscrossing the state in a huge GMC motor home vehicle plastered with Rich for Governor signs . The vehicle stops wherever people will listen . Usually referred to as a " minor candidate , " Rich often complains that the media pays little attention to his activities , but he proudly boasts that he has been interviewed by newspaper and television reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers are always the same , almost word for word , as if his political philosophy and goals were the products of his basement silkscreening operation . He wants to " solidify " Proposition 2 1/2 , which he calls the taxpayers ' way of showing that the $500 million property tax rollback King promised could work . He wants to introduce the concept of zero-based budgeting to state spending , so that every state agency head would have to justify every penny spent , not just the proposed increases over the previous year ' s spending level . He wants a ceiling on state spending and tight controls in order to produce what he refers to as the " profits of government " - budget surpluses - that can be returned to taxpayers or used to expand essential state services . He wants restoration of the death penalty for " premeditated murder " and increased prison accommodations in tents and barracks on unused federal facilities in Massachusetts . In addition , he has proposed that judges ' performance be reviewed every six years . He wants abortion to be outlawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have wanted to be aborted . " Although his positions are clear , it ' s less apparent how Rich would negotiate such proposals through the legislative shoals on which his friend King saw a number of pet projects founder . That process , after all , would require him to deal with the 200 politicians who comprise the Legislature , and Rich is a man who says : " I ' m sure there ' s a good politician somewhere . I ' ve just never met one . "
