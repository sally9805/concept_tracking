In an inspired pairing , St. Louis assigned Stan Musial and Moe Drabowsky last week to throw out a first ball at the World Series , something to do with their being Polish . Musial was and is a natural . When Missouri first heard that a Polish Cardinal had been elected Pope , most folks presumed it was Stan . But the selection of Drabowsky showed an instinct befitting the best baseball town in America , an affection for October strangers . <P> With almost any team you can name , not just the Cardinals , Drabowsky was a relief pitcher in the ' 60s famous for his sense of humor and a proclivity for charging long-distance calls to the bullpen telephones . Retiring to a brokerage , he wrote a book titled Everything I Know About the Stock Market , filled with empty pages . Just last week he thought of adding a chapter . But on an unlikely afternoon in 1966 , Drabowsky turned into the sort of World Series hero Dan Gladden and Tom Lawless have just become , not to mention Al Weis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past that Ring Lardner could not have invented . <P> Every year the World Series comes as a surprise . In Drabowsky 's year the Koufax-Drysdale Dodgers were supposed to sweep the Baltimore Orioles , but they got swept instead , with Moe striking out six in a row . This year first the Cardinals were expected to overwhelm the Twins , then the Twins were poised to obliterate the Cardinals . The reverse happened in turn . A grand-slam homer from a lead-off hitter like Minnesota 's Gladden qualifies as a marvel , but the home run later hit by Lawless was a miracle . <P> A third-string catcher who sat around St. Louis all season without chipping ! in so much as one RBI , Lawless evened the series with his mighty blow in Game Four off the winner of the opener , Frank Viola . " You can see it in their eyes , " Viola had said of his teammates , who twice chose the fourth inning on their way to a thumping 10-1 and 8-4 start at home . " The trouble is , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course it was the fourth inning when Lawless , the .080 hitter , stood at home plate with two on beholding the left- field fence like a man seeing Shangri-la before the recent riots . The ball barely skimmed over . <P> The first Cardinal out of the dugout to congratulate him was Pitcher Ken Dayley , a moment of pure poetry . The only other homer Lawless ever hit in the big leagues , some three years ago , was off Dayley . To press the point , with the bases loaded in the seventh inning , Dayley came in to save the game . This may be stretching poetry a bit far , but that is the World Series . For the way he marshals the forces of Vince Coleman , Ozzie Smith and Curt Ford , Manager Whitey Herzog is celebrated as a thinker . ( " The game of baseball 's been awful good to me ever since I stopped trying to play it . " ) But the older Cardinals manager , Coach Red Schoendienst , still likes to flutter his fingers at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With bunts , balks and stolen bases , the Cardinals finished a three-game sweep on their own plastic turf ( 3-1 , 7-2 and 4-2 ) to assume a one-game lead .
