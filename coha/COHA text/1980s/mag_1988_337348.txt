The first image to greet the eye is perhaps the last to linger in the mind : it is the set , vertiginously toppling outward as if to plunge a collapsing world and its demented inhabitants into the audience 's laps . The place depicted must have been a palace once . Now the arches have sagged , and the staircases end in midair . The steeply raked floor intersects doorways at crazy angles , as though it were not wood but water , flooding a city where the people too seem to be drowning . This haunted spot is Epirus , home of Pyrrhus , heroic son of the even more valiant Achilles , and the time is soon after the Trojan War . <P> The nightmare world being enacted is not only ancient Greece but also the courtly France of 1667 , where Jean Racine wrote his tragedy Andromaque , and the skinhead London of 1988 , whose coarse argot has been chosen by Director Jonathan Miller to lend contemporary clout . The melange of cultures does not always work , although much else does in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's production , which opened last week at London 's Old Vic Theater , is an event of considerably broader consequence than a re-examination of an austere and little-produced play by one of the theater 's ablest and most innovative directors . <P> The Old Vic for decades housed a company that emphasized Shakespeare and included some of the great British stage names of the 20th century : Olivier , Gielgud , Richardson , Guinness and Ashcroft among them . Then , from 1963 to 1976 , it served as the first home of Britain 's National Theater . Thereafter it declined into a mere booking hall , just another space where a producer might launch a commercial production . Now Miller and the theater 's owners , Toronto Businessman Ed Mirvish , 73 , and his son David , 43 , are seeking to bring back the glory days of the classics . Their goal : a commercial troupe to rival in quality the two huge subsidized London ensembles , the National and the Royal Shakespeare Company . <P> As Miller 's controversial reputation would suggest , they will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian opera in gangster territory , for example , and reimagined O'Neill 's Long Day 's Journey into Night as caustic tragicomedy rather than lugubrious apocalypse . Andromache is the first offering of a seven-play season , of which Miller will direct five . With characteristic confidence in his polymathic perversity , he has assigned himself an absurdist British comedy , N.F. Simpson 's One Way Pendulum ; a Jacobean tragedy , Bussy D'Ambois ; a Leonard Bernstein musical , Candide , which Miller says " will have more flavor of the original Voltaire " ; and Shakespeare 's The Tempest . Also on the roster are Reinhold Lenz 's The Tutor , adapted by Brecht , and Alexander Ostrovsky 's 19th century Russian comedy Too Clever By Half . " I want to break out of the stale convection current that keeps endlessly recirculating the same old Shaw and Chekhov , " says Miller . " We are part of Europe , and there are vast expanses of European literature unknown to London audiences . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
