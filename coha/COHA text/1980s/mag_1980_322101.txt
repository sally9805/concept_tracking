And he sweeps a host of new Republican faces into office with him <P> Landslide . Yes , landslide-stunning , startling , astounding , beyond the wildest dreams and nightmares of the contending camps , beyond the furthest ken of the armies of pollsters , pundits and political professionals . After all the thousands of miles , the millions of words and dollars , the campaign that in newspapers across the land on the very morning of Election Day was still headlined TOO CLOSE TO CALL turned out to be a landslide . The American voter had struck again . Half the election-watching parties in the nation were over before the guests arrived . The ponderous apparatus of the television networks ' Election Night coverage had scarcely got on the air before it was over . NBC called the winner at 8:15 p.m . E.S.T. , and the loser conceded while Americans were still standing in line at polling booths in much of the country . In a savage repudiation of a sitting President not seen since F.D.R. swept away Herbert Hoover in the midst of the Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oldest man ever to be elected President , to replace Jimmy Carter in the White House . <P> It was shortly after midnight when the hamlet of Dixville Notch , N.H. , became the first community in the nation to cast its ballots and set a trend that never varied : 17 to 3 for the challenger . Once the big count began , all the shibboleths of the election-that Americans were confused , apathetic and wished a plague on all the candidates and , above all , that they were closely divided-were swept away by a rising tide of votes , some hopeful , many angry , that carried Reagan to victory in one of the most astonishing political and personal triumphs in the nation 's history . <P> Even before the counting began , reporters ' interviews with voters leaving the polls made clear that a remarkable Reagan victory was gathering force . That force quickly proved tidal . Some of the first returns came from states that Carter had to win to have any hope at all , and they made it mercilessly clear that the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled , through Carter 's native South , into the nation 's industrial heartland , on to the West , until , reluctantly at the end , even New York fell to the Republicans . <P> As the tallies piled up , they buried nearly every comfortable assumption that the pundits had made about how Americans would cast their ballots . Among them : <P> &gt; The growing promise that the American hostages in Iran would be returned-the closest thing to the " October surprise " that the Reagan camp had long dreaded-apparently helped Carter not a bit , and may have cost him dearly . <P> &gt; Independent Candidate John Anderson did not elect Ronald Reagan by significantly weakening Carter ; indeed he had no effect on the election outcome as a whole . <P> &gt; The huge number of voters who had told pollsters that they were undecided evidently broke decidedly for Reagan , thus confounding the conventional wisdom that disaffected Democrats in the end would " come home " to their party . <P> &gt; Women , who had been thought particularly susceptible to Carter 's charge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote Democratic in anything like the numbers expected .
