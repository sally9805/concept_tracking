What they write can be amusing . For example , Mr. Trudeau , admiring an open-cockpit aviator jacket he either covets or already owns , manages to find an excuse for " so many of the wares offered in this catalogue " being " inspired by military fashion . " After all , he points out , " such carping overlooks that **28;1414; all <> clothes are , in effect , uniforms . " He concludes , " The truth of the matter is that I am not an open-cockpit aviator ; I am simply a guy who is trying to make a fast , clean fashion statement and then get on with his life . The truth is that all I really want is a simple jacket that wears well , has deep pockets , and resists baby formula . If people want to mistake me for Sam Shepard , that ' s their problem. " // // Does such drollery really serve to move the merchandise ? I have not undertaken a formal survey , nor have I ever seen any numbers . I can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which I do my mail-ordering . Ours is but a modestly acquisitive node of consumption . As consumers , we rank low in the judgment of the market analysts at L. L. Bean , which sends as many as 12 mail-order catalogues a year to its favored customers . We receive but four . We browse through our catalogues and dream , but with relative infrequency do we make an actual purchase. // This may explain why in 1984 our household received only about 500 catalogues from fewer than 100 different mail-order concerns . I can ' t imagine what we ever bought to deserve even this paltry influx . Maybe it was that pogo stick of a lawn aerator I once ordered from Brookstone in Peterborough , N. H. But just imagine the number of catalogues that the big spenders must receive - the people who act upon their gut desire for a Nautilus abdominal machine , or fulfill their yen for a Benihana-style cooking table , or who succumb to the lure of a telephone that looks like a duck ? // Anyway , after a casual sampling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that the witty words of the Banana Republic writers did not touch the part of me that buys . I hope I have a good enough sense of humor not to be offended by the company ' s ulterior appeal to our imperialist instincts - pith helmets , bandoliers and bush pilots ' vests being among their specialties - but I ' m completely a picture person when it comes to catalogue browsing . I prefer the rainbow of brightly colored clothes , the gleam of complicated gadgets , the grimace of rugged athletes out there at the edge of their endurance. // Of course , the Banana Republic catalogue is visually appealing , too , in its way , full of drawings and watercolors so stylish that one has to wonder if the real things live up to their images . I would therefore include it among the more appealing mail-order catalogues of 1984 . But my real favorites are the following : for grown-up toys , The Sharper Image ( 680 Davis Street , San Francisco , CA 94111 ) ; for electronic gadgets , Markline ( P.O. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; for women ' s sportswear , Esprit ( 950 Tennessee Street , San Francisco 94107 ) ; for outdoor and running gear , Moss Brown &; Co. ( 5210 Eisenhower Avenue , Alexandria , Va. 22304 ) ; for casual wear for both sexes , J. Crew Outfitters ( 18 Lincoln Place , Garfield , N. J. 07026 ) , and for all-around outdoor equipment , Early Winters ( 110 Prefontaine Place South , Seattle 98104 ) . // // One mailing piece whose words I do find appealing is " Literature Unbound : A Guide for the Common Reader , " by Sam Tanenhaus - a copy of which was recently being offered to any reader who joined either of two Doubleday book clubs , the International Collectors Library or the Literary Guild. // " Literature Unbound " was first conceived a few years ago by a Doubleday editor , G. Gregory Tobin , as a pamphlet or guidebook that would offer readers a concise primer for Western literature . Mr. Tobin had looked at what was available , and , finding most of it dull , condescending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew to try his hand. // The result , understandably , astonished Mr. Tobin . Sam Tanenhaus - a 29-year-old New Yorker with degrees in literature from Grinnell and Yale who is currently a Junior Fellow at the New York Institute for the Humanities - does manage near the end of his 143-page volume to zip through Western Lit , touching lightly upon every major writer from Aristophanes and Euripides through Dante , Chaucer , Cervantes , Shakespeare , Racine , Milton , Blake , Goethe , Wordsworth , Balzac , Dickens , Tolstoy , Dostoevski , Byron , Baudelaire , and so forth down to the modernists of Europe and America - all in just over 30 pages. // Yet even in this rapid-fire survey , Mr. Tanenhaus ' s interest is not in spewing out literary data . It is , rather , to trace the writer ' s gradual retreat from his society into various modes of exile , the latter-day paradigms being such political exiles as Freud , Mann and Nabokov , such " morally motivated " migrants as Henry James , Ezra Pound and T. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-protective reasons as William Faulkner , J. D. Salinger and Thomas Pynchon. // This preoccupation with the writer in conflict with society reflects the theme of Part I of " Literature Unbound , " which is a longer essay surveying the self in relation to " reality " in various literary works themselves . Mainly emphasizing the evolution of the novel , Mr. Tanenhaus begins with 18th century realism and ends with 20th century formalism . As he proceeds , he shows through a series of unidentified passages how the literary self , or persona , grows disillusioned , withdraws , divides , has visions both hellish and ecstatic , plays games , breaks the rules , and invents new games and realities . All in just 90 pages. // The result is edifying , a slice from literature thin enough to be digestible yet rich enough to nourish . As Mr. Tanenhaus himself sums up his journey : " We began in the objective world of social reality ; voyaged to a place where , from the depths of solitude , new worlds seemed tangible ; and arrived finally in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they had been built out of the oldest and most familiar tools in our possession - words . A direct journey , but also a circular one . It is origins , we learned , that all progress leads to. " // The only carp I have is with Mr. Tanenhaus ' s decision not to identify the passages he quotes except in an appendix , his stated aim being that readers should " look to the work , not to the author . " The trouble is , the truly literate will recognize the passages anyway , and the merely well- read will know enough to be curious about the rest . In fact , the only readers who won ' t be tempted to keep consulting the appendix to learn who wrote the passages , will probably be those on whom the point of " Literature Unbound " would be lost in any case. // This point is that reading is a complex activity . As Mr. Tanenhaus sums it up , " Reading is an activity , something we **28;1444; do <> with energy and concentration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reading is neither work nor relaxation . It belongs instead to that special place where all our disparate selves converge . Literature can provide us with revelation , or its mirror opposite , escape ; it can give us both at once . At its most playful literature instructs , and when it is most urgent it disarms and delights. // " Keeping these paradoxes in mind , the reader should be ready for anything , above all for surprise , the highest gift books can bestow and the motive behind their manifold deceits . Books mean to catch us up in our old selves , and offer us new ones . And they can only succeed when we are primed to become different people . It is we , in the end , who invent and inhabit the rival worlds of literature. " // Unfortunately , " Literature Unbound " is not available in a trade edition . To get it you must join either of the book clubs that offer it , or borrow it from a friend who happens to be a member . You can ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
