Six months after U.S. funds stop , the contras turn elsewhere <P> Once the mule is saddled and mounted , there is no turning back . - Honduran proverb <P> Like the proverbial mule , the contras fighting the Sandinista government of Nicaragua just keep plodding along . Six months after the U.S. Congress voted to cut off their covert Central Intelligence Agency funding , the rebels have come to depend increasingly on supplies and money from private U.S. sources . Economic hardship has forced the guerrilla factions to halt their frequent bickering , but a united front remains elusive . The war itself has quieted down , with the insurgents avoiding battles with Nicaraguan troops in favor of ambushes and hit-and-run strikes . The overall reality , however , has not changed : the contras right now are too small in number and too ill equipped to threaten the Sandinistas seriously , but they are also too stubborn to give up . " The contras know they ca n't win , but they wo n't admit it , " says a prominent Honduran businessman . " At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know they are in a quagmire . " <P> The rebels contend that the future is not that bleak . The Nicaraguan Democratic Force ( FDN ) , the largest of the guerrilla groups , has about 6,000 troops , up from 4,500 a year ago , deep inside Nicaragua . FDN Leader Adolfo Calero Portocarrero says he is close to Unking forces with the Revolutionary Democratic Alliance ( ARDE ) , another contra group operating in southern Nicaragua . The chiefs of two Miskito Indian rebel groups remain at odds , but disgruntled commanders in both camps are trying to forge an alliance on the battlefield . Though many divisions remain , the FDN is gradually exerting its control over the entire contra movement . " There is an awakening toward the necessity of a joint effort by all the forces , " says Calero . <P> Many contras , however , are barely surviving . Times have been hardest for Eden Pastora Gomez , the volatile leader of an ARDE branch that at one time had as many as 2,500 men . Over the past few months , hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where many of them have sold their $1,000 automatic weapons for as little as $100 . " In the best month , we got $600,000 from the gringos , " recalls a Pastora aide . " Now , we get nothing . If one of us manages to scrape together $5,000 , we buy rice and maybe 20,000 rounds of ammunition . " Last month Pastora sought temporary asylum for himself and 700 of his followers in Costa Rica , but the authorities refused him . <P>
