The defendant in the dimly lit Ankara courtroom last week was expressionless as the prosecutor called for a verdict of not guilty . Bulent Ecevit , three- time Prime Minister of Turkey between 1974 and 1979 , had been charged with engaging in political activity , which under a 1982 decree is illegal for former party leaders .
