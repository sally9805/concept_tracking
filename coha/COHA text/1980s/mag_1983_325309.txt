Aspen struggles to recover <P> When the ski boom hit in the late 1960s , Aspen quickly emerged as its glamorous headquarters . Tourists flocked to the old Colorado silver-mining town turned winter resort , lured by the 11,300-ft . Aspen Mountain , the classy lodges and chic crowds . Its glittery , fast-lane image later included pricy real estate and such open cocaine use that it acquired the nickname " Toot City . " Artists , ski bums and a coterie of rich and famous , including Actor Jack Nicholson and Troubadour John Denver , settled in what Denver dubbed " the sweet Rocky Mountain paradise . " Now , as the ski craze cools and recession-fueled competition among Western resorts increases , hard times have intruded on paradise . <P> There are no longer snaking lines at the lifts feeding Ruthie 's Run , Aspen 's best-known trail . In the past year the landmark Red Onion saloon has closed , along with several other restaurants . Five lodges , including the 170-unit Continental Inn , are in the midst of foreclosure . Retail sales growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when profits grew at an annual rate of more than 15% . Owners of chic boutiques and eateries gripe that business is significantly down from last season . The " Silver Queen , " as residents fondly refer to their town , even looks a bit bedraggled . Compared with accommodations in Vail , which now attracts more business , Aspen 's once premier lodges seem cramped and aging . Says Boutique Owner Rita St. John : " People are paying $200 a night and getting a dump . " There is no first-class resort hotel . Zoning and building limitations passed when the town was thriving have hobbled renovation and expansion efforts . <P> Not surprisingly , the business community and some townsfolk , who think Aspen ( pop . 7,620 ) has been too complacent in the face of growing competition , want to spruce it up and launch a promotional campaign .

" But other residents , who want to preserve Aspen 's small-town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're a mature resort with a solid product , " says Lodge Owner Allan Blomquist . " We do n't need flamboyant hype . " <P> Aspen faces a showdown next week in the debate over its future , when residents will vote in a special election on whether to impose a local business tax . The revenues , which could generate up o $1.5 million a year , would go into a fund to set up services to attract tourists . Examples : a computerized central reservation system for the area 's lodges and an association to woo ski clubs and conventions . Even if the new tax is approved , Aspen faces an uphill battle . For one thing , the baby boomers who led the rush to the slopes are older now . " The skiing hotshots of the ' 60s are married now with three children , " says Chamber of Commerce President Tom Clark . " We need to work harder to get them . " Mindful of the family crowd , police have cracked down on overt cocaine use . Another problem : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since 1975 the number of ski areas in Colorado alone has snowballed from 27 to 35 , and Aspen 's share of the state pie has slid from 29.5% in 1972-73 to 15.7% last season .
