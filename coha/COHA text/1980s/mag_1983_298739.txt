Penner becomes director of the Congressional Budget Office <P> It 's an ill office to be the first to herald I ill , " wrote Aeschylus , the Greek tragedian , in the 5th century B.C. By that standard , the director of the Congressional Budget Office occupies one of the illest offices in Washington . Since becoming the CBO 's first director when the agency was set up in 1975 , Alice Rivlin has had the thankless task of telling Congress how big future budget deficits will be and proposing various alternatives , most of them politically unpalatable , for reducing the shortfall . After eight often frustrating years , Rivlin , 52 , last week turned that role over to Rudolph G. Penner , 47 , a conservative Republican economist with a strong distaste for deficits . <P> Rivlin 's final forecast showed the budget gap hitting a record $207 billion this year and then falling gradually to about $145 billion in 1986 . Penner 's predictions may turn out to be gloomier . Before being named to the CBO post , he warned that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep recession hits , the shortfall could reach $300 billion by the late 1980s . While Penner favors cuts in federal spending to help close the budget gap , he also argues that tax hikes are unavoidable . Says he : " The only real questions are how much taxes will be raised and in what way . It 's going to happen . " <P> Penner brings impressive credentials to the CBO . As chief economist for the Office of Management and Budget during the Ford Administration , he learned how to find his way through the thick forest of figures in the budget . After President Ford lost the 1976 election , Penner joined the American Enterprise Institute , a conservative research organization in Washington , and became a leading expert on tax policy . Says David Stockman , the Reagan Administration 's Budget Director : " Penner is the best available person for the job at CBO . He 's experienced , knowledgeable and technically sound . " <P> Rivlin , a Democrat whom some Republicans accused of being too liberal , announced her intention to resign more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection of her successor . Rivlin endorsed Penner , as did the chairmen of the two congressional budget committees , Republican Senator Pete Domenici and Democratic Representative James Jones . But House Speaker Tip O'Neill attempted to block the choice , preferring a liberal Democrat for the job . Ironically , Penner 's calls for tax increases have been putting him at odds with White House policy and rankling a few congressional Republicans . After Penner advocated higher taxes at an American Enterprise Institute luncheon in June , a reporter asked him , " How can you hope to have a chance at that CBO job when you say things like that ? " Snapped Penner : " I refuse to run a campaign for the job . All I can do is say what I think and not worry about it . "
