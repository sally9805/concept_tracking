Bush 's Lukewarm Welcome Though every new President gets something of a honeymoon with his constituency , George Bush 's debut as Chief Executive will be marked more by cool realism than by warm affection . The TIME/CNN survey conducted by Yankelovich Clancy Shulman last week showed that the dearth of popular enthusiasm that dogged Campaign ' 88 has persisted . Now it focuses on Bush and Dan Quayle . <P> First Impressions . Just 50% of the public has a favorable impression of Bush , vs. 21% with an unfavorable perception and 29% uncertain . Quayle still runs a deficit on this score : 20% favorable , 30% unfavorable and 50% with no opinion . More than half ( 52% ) do not consider Quayle qualified to become President if something were to happen to Bush . <P> Containing the $155.1 billion federal budget deficit is the electorate 's top assignment for its new leader . The fiscal shortfall is seen as the country 's main economic problem by 43% , vs. 22% who name unemployment , 16% the trade deficit and 11% inflation . Seven out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the same large majority predicts that he will fail to avert them . <P> Which should be Bush 's first priority ? <P> Reducing the budget deficit 33% <P> Attacking the drug problem 20% <P> Addressing the trade imbalance 11% <P> Dealing with terrorism 22% <P> Public Confidence .

Bush . Reagan 's expansive claims about having revived the American Dream have helped keep his popularity high . But the public takes a hard-headed view of his performance in some areas ; 55% think he did a " poor job " in maintaining programs for the needy , and 63% fault him for the deficit .
