Ahazy afternoon in Malibu . The air was thick with a covert sparkle that made the eyes smart . The ocean barely moved . Norman Jewison 's lunch party was sauntering along the Colony Beach . The director was sporting a beard and a mariner 's navy blue cap , and dangling from a neck chain were mementos : a tiny fist from James Caan , a piglet from Goldie Hawn , a St. Christopher medal from his wife , Dixie . We passed people sitting on their decks , sprawled on beach towels , a solitary jogger . Nods were exchanged , and greetings , but nothing too warm . Malibu makes something of a point of sticking to the protocol of a London club . A walker approached . It was Jerry Perenchio , the movie producer . He , too , sported naval headgear . It was Perenchio who had acquired nine acres between the Colony and the Pacific Coast Highway for several million , walled them in , and built himself a jogging track . This track is said to be equipped with subsoil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital signs , and even Malibu was rather amazed by this enterprise . " How about some tennis ? " he asked Jewison . Jewison could n't make it . " What about next weekend ? " " We 'll be in Austin , Texas , " Jewison said . It was unnecessary for Jewison to explain that he would be moviemaking . It 's a nomadic place , Malibu . We walked on , and I stooped to pick up a piece of sea glass . Sea glass is what beach people call fragments of glass that have been scoured by the waves . " When people start collecting sea glass or driftwood , you know they 've been here too long , " Jewison said . " They stop directing .. . acting . . . writing . They 're just out there . On the beach . " The seductions of Malibu . Anthony Haden-Guest writes for New York magazine . He is finishing a book about the last capitalist heroes .

And I 'm looking at the waves . You know how that can get you ? In the end , we went upstairs to a small room and pulled the curtains . We might as well have been in New York . " Malibu is famously seductive , as it is , simply , famous . It is famous because many famous people live here , or have lived here , Malibu is a ghetto of the rich in a place where the rich are created by industries ? movies , music , " entertainment " ? in which fame is part of the product . Indeed , Malibu has become a place name like Monte Carlo , say , used by columnists and copywriters for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was called Malibu and produced by a man who had rented a house here , depicted a community whose principal diversions appeared to be cocaine and extramarital sex . A cover story in People last August described the place as a " celebrity sandbox " and devoted three dozen lines of solid type to listing the celebs , from A ( lpert , Herb ) to Z ( adora , Pia ) . But to spend time in Malibu is to learn that it is not obsessed with fame , and certainly not with morals . Malibu 's obsession is property . Endangered property , especially . Malibu , you see , is also famously hazardous . The hazards are fires and winds , earthquakes , mud slides , and ocean gales , to say nothing of such rococo byproducts of the above as nervous rattlesnakes in the hills . Attention is now focused on the sea . Early last year the Pacific smashed up hundreds of expen sive houses . The fourteen that were wholly destroyed included the " Mildred Pierce " house72 HARPER 'S / APRIL so called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older houses built by movie-studio carpenters , had no foundation . Also destroyed was the house that Billie Jean King had repossessed from her ex-lover after a much publicized court case . Unseasonable storms struck again last August . Twenty-foot waves inflicted $2 million worth of damage on properties including Barbra Streisand 's pink-and-green edifice , sometimes referred to as the Easter Egg . " Signs of destruction were everywhere last April as Jewison and I approached the end of the Colony Beach , and headed back . A sandbagged gun emplacement turned out to be Dyan Cannon 's house . Behind a makeshift Stonehenge lurked the abode of Bruce Dern . Halfway down the beach I ran into a young woman of my acquaintance . She was , she said , planning to shoot a video movie on the beach . It would be comical . What was the subject ? " Celebrity feces . " The latest Malibu hazard , she explained , was that various storm-damaged cesspits had become unsound . That milky-green water from which I had recently emerged had been characterized by a coastal commissioner as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch of beach . A shirt was dangling from a pole atop a particularly battered house . " They did everything they could , " he said . " Then they hung up the white flag . They surrendered to the storm . " There have always been storms in Malibu , residents point out : the storms come and take away the beaches , and then they go and the beaches sift back , and winter memories are expunged by summer fun . So things have always been . The trouble is that things have not always been so . In the mid-nineteenth century , according to Jerry Kuhn , a geologist at Scripps Ocean Research in La Jolla , mariners described the weather in Santa Monica Bay as " worse than Cape Horn . " He believes that the last thirty years of mostly excellent beach weather may be an anomaly , a sort of blip on the chart . Other researchers study the Peruvian anchovy and the peregrinations of that mass of weather-altering warm water called ( a sweet touch ) El Nino de Navidad , meaning " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malibu environmentalists prepare studies about the impact of the proposed oil drilling in the bay , and find other causes for alarm . Meanwhile , the godfathers of the present-day apocalyptists , the earthquake men , listen to the hum in the globe 's tectonic plates and periodically cry wolf . Their cumulative message seems to be that the future of Malibu may be less than jolly , insofar as it has one . But it was the attitudes of the Califorregion , the Chumash , who had a sizable settlement here . They were an attractive , unambitious tribe . " They lived a very uncomplicated lifestyle materially , " said anthropologist Joanna Van Tilburg , who lives in the Malibu hills . " They did n't have monumental architecture . The Spaniards had contempt for them . " We , seeing what can happen to monumental architecture in southern California , might well decide that the Indians knew a thing or two the Spaniards did n't , The last full-blooded Chumash died in the 1950s , but there is a community of part-Chumash in Oxnard , north of Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their burial ground on Point Dume is now a mobile- home park . In 1802 Malibu was established as a Spanish estancia . Eighty-five years later , all 17,000 acres of it were acquired by Frederick Rindge , a Massachusetts tycoon who dreamed of a private Riviera . He died in 1905 and left the property to his wife , May . She became a formidable figure , battling homesteaders and the U.S. government , which had the impertinent desire to run a highway through her property , connecting Los Angeles with San Francisco . Things became so fraught that a 1916 headline in the Los Angeles Times ran : " War Threatens in the Malibu . " Mrs. Rindge lost her battle with the government in 1925 and , drained by years of expensive litigation , began to lease plots on the beach . The early renters were mostly movie folk , and it was in this period that Malibu acquired its racy reputation . Even nowadays , a realtor ? and realtors like Posey Carpentier and Vicki Pierson are the only Malibu personages with the heft of a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the nugget that such and such a property was the scene of an assignation of , say , Claudette Colbert , Malibu enjoys this racy reputation to this day . Or , perhaps , does n't enjoy . " People come out here to make a quick buck by ripping it to shreds , " director Billy Wilder told me . " In Malibu , they have diamond-studded surfboards and are already snorting before breakfast ! It 's the People magazine syndrome . " Well , technicolor episodes are not unknown . There is the tale of the young wife . She was last seen on the beach , talking with a lifeguard . They walked off into the sunset , " I was told . " She did n't pack . She did n't even take her beach towel . " Then there was the woman who found that her husband was having a fling with a female producer . She drenched her rival 's house with kerosene .

Malibu , the TV series , was not well received . Kathryn Altman , wife of di ' rector Robert , happened to be in Manhattan when it was aired , and noticed some tittering at her aerobics class . Her sweatshirt was lettered : MALIBU . " It 's a very solid community , " she told the class . " I raised a family there . " Some rather regret the jazzier days of yore . They attribute the change to economics . Malibu used to be where people partied in their beach houses . Not today . " We 're here the year round , " said Mickey Ziffren , wife of the entertainment lawyer Paul . " We do n't have all that stuff , like starfish and the rattan you picked up in Hong Kong . We live here . " Domesticity remains one of the last words people associate with the place , though , and Malibuites tend to blame that on " the media .

A few days later , a French movie magazine was photo-graphing Stephanie Audran on the beach , in gold lame and black fur . " It 's mink , " she informed me . " But not serious mink . " The distinction between the Summer People It 's true that many of the original shacks have been replaced by more grandiose structures , L.A.-styled to resemble mortuary chapels or jumbo saunas , but only a few ? Neil Diamond 's , for one ? occupy double lots , and the only House &; Garden type place , the Sterling House , looks as at home as a Brancusi among garden gnomes . Actually , what the Colony most resembles from the sea is one side of a street in one of London 's frowstier suburbs . Carbon , the stretch of Malibu Beach just south of the Colony , is home to , for instance , Johnny Carson , and thinks itself far more blessed . " Everything is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Nancy Bryson , whose photographer husband , John , is a longtime Carbon resident . Dwellers in Trancas , at the northern tip of Malibu ? Billy Wilder , Ali McGraw , novelist Brian Moore ? agree that the Colony is too crowded but think that Carbon is practically in downtown Los Angeles . " Trancas is just inconvenient enough , " said McGraw . Colony folk , for their part , say how sorry they are for the poor wretches in Carbon and Trancas , breathing in the fumes off the Pacific Coast Highway , and they feel rather nifty behind their white , well-guarded gates . These gates , by the way , have sparked a dispute with yet another group : the people who are technically of the Colony , but live beyond the gates on Malibu Road . In February 1982 , Burgess Meredith was moved to send the Malibu Colony Association a letter . He pointed out that " for about twelve years I have been scrupulous about paying dues to the Malibu Colony Association , " but complained that promises of security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he wrote , seemed to consist only of a " few casual beach-sweeping benefits . " Tongue more or less firmly in cheek , he threatened to secede , concluding , " Meantime , I 'll follow up with the outer residents . Maybe we can join up like NATO . " Copies of this missive were sent to , among others , Rod Steiger , Bruce Dern , and Larry Hagman . There was some to-ing and fro-ing ? at one point Meredith felt that Don Rickles could he persuaded to accept the presidency of the Malibu Colony Rejectionist Front ? but the situation seems to have sputtered back to the status quo . That was not the last of Meredith 's problems . Few things incite more wrath in Malibu than a neighbor 's building something that might impinge on one 's view . Larry Hagman lives next-door to Meredith , and had been for many years a close friend . Two years ago , he began to enlarge his house . As the house waxed , the friendship waned .

Until last year , the worst in recent memory had been the storm of 1979 . It was then that Governor Jerry Brown , the bel anu of Linda Ronstadt at the time , declared the Malibu Colony a disaster area . The National Guard came in to sandbag , helicopters buzzed overhead ( Will Dr. So-and-so call his office ? ) , and there was help from the students at Pepperdine and convicts from the honor farm . Various Malibu Colony members got together and proposed building a strong sea wall . Bruce Dern , however , declined to have anything to do with it . His house , he declared , was safe . One ca n't have a partial sea wall , of course , so the scheme was aborted . The heavy rains make the vegetation grow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

It was like lava . " His wife and children left , but Davis decided to save the house . " At 12:35 the mailman turned up to deliver my mail as if it was a normal day . The Santa Ana was so strong it blew my glasses off . On the land side , the smoke made things black . It was like midnight . Out to sea , it was a clear day .

My son and I each took a dog . We had the cats in a box . We collected our snapshots and a bunch of towels . We were going to walk into the water with the towels wrapped around our heads . You lose object obsessiveness . My friend Katharine Ross 's house was burned to the ground . She just galloped down the beach with her horses .

The flames suck the oxygen away . The water then boils . Yes . But one begins to realize something one had not expected . Catastrophe anecdotes are polished , like pebbles worn by handling . Polaroids of wreckage are shown off , Larry Hagman 's son , Preston , runs video clips recorded from the TV news . " Welcome to Malibu ! " he said .

We went out on the deck , and I watched the houses coming apart . It was unreal . " " The most dangerous thing was the driftwood , " producer Alan Landsberg said . " Pilings from the piers were being hurled at us . It was scary . The only reason for being on the beach is to have as much glass facing the sea as possible . " The Landsbergs moved into town .

For the most part , the raging storms induced a degree of camaraderie , even among the most reclusive of Malibuites . Whatever private decisions people have been making concerning the future of their property , few admitted to thinking of quitting . So-and-so just lost his teahouse , one was told . " Anybody in it .

Next time , the vote will quite possibly be yes , which means that the community will have more control over its own affairs ? the Malibu strip may even stop looking like the Jersey Turnpike ? but which also means that taxes will rise . Which , in turn , means that the development hotels , condos ? resisted for so long will follow . " I was on the beach on July 4 , " realtor Tim Lyon said .

" Last year they complained about ten-foot waves at Malibu , " he told me . " Do you know what we recorded there in 1939 ? Waves of more than forty feet . " " The whole thing is that this historical perthought-provoking report from his geologist . The geologist had told him that the peculiarity of Malibu was that the water table was very close to the surface . " Like in Alaska , " the man had said . " What does that mean ?
