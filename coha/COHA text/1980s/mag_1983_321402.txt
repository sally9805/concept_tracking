The economy continues to pick up speed with surprising swiftness . The Federal Reserve Board reported last week that U.S. industrial production , led by sharp increases in the output of steel and autos , surged 1.8% in July , the eighth monthly increase in a row . Convinced that consumers will continue spending freely , companies are rushing to rebuild their inventories .

Sales of domestically produced autos jumped 38.5% , while home furnishings , including furniture and appliances , were up 8.5% . <P> Many economists now forecast that overall growth in the gross national product from July 1 to Sept. 30 , after adjustment for inflation , will be in the 7% to 8% range . <P> That would approach the stunning 9.2% annual rate recorded in the second quarter .

" <P> A few . signs , however , point to a cooling off by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points in mortgage rates over the past few months , for example , has slowed the pickup in construction .
