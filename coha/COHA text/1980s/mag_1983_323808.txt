What did the Soviets know ? <P> Shortly after the fiery end of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 , a senior Reagan Administration official said the U.S. had " irrefutable " evidence the Soviets knew that the plane they blasted out of the skies over Sakhalin Island was a commercial jet . The President and U.N . Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick made statements last month that in effect indicted the U.S.S.R. for deliberate , cold-blooded murder of the airliner 's 269 passengers and crew . But last week the Administration admitted that the proof , far from being irrefutable , is nonexistent . Said State Department Spokesman Alan Romberg : " We do not have the evidence " to show conclusively that the pilots of the Soviet interceptors and their ground controllers knew what kind of plane they were downing . <P> Romberg was reacting to a New York Times story that claimed most U.S. intelligence experts now believe the Soviets really might have mistaken KAL 007 for an American reconnaissance , plane . But that assertion , intelligence officials told TIME , goes too far in the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no evidence that the pilots or their ground controllers ever made a positive identification one way or the other . <P> As American intelligence people now reconstruct the event , Soviet radar at first did erroneously identify the plane as an American RC-135 ( a reconnaissance version of the Boeing 707 ) . An RC-135 had been in the North Pacific earlier that night . Though the Soviets tracked KAL 007 with radar for more than two hours , it is now believed that their interceptors had trouble finding the airliner . Not until it was about to leave Soviet airspace did they finally bring it into sight , and then they had to make a quick decision . They shot . <P> Did they know what they had hit ? If not , say U.S. officials , they should have . The Times story asserts that the interceptor pilot probably fired two air-to-air missiles from behind and below the jet , a position from which he could not readily have identified the distinctive shape of a Boeing 747 . Perhaps , but a 747 is much bigger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate that the jet showed flashing navigation and strobe lights , not a common characteristic of spy planes . <P> It is possible that the pilots and their ground controllers rushed to destroy the jet without making sure what it was , rather than take what they judged to be the greater risk of explaining to Moscow that they had let an " intruder " plane get away . That would still be utterly inexcusable behavior . Said Romberg of the Soviets : " They had the responsibility to find out . If they did n't , they were incompetent or negligent , or both .
