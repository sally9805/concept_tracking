The Legislature wound up its 1981 session this week , purporting to deal only-with " major " legislation , but nonetheless succeeding in demonstrating with the same disdain for decent procedures that plagued it for the whole year . For instance , even though the House and Senate late last year passed a bill outlawing any language in budgets that did not pertain to the actual appropriation of money , the Legislature managed in the supplementary budget passed Tuesday to gives Donovan life tenure as chief of the State ' s soldiers ' home in Chelsea . No matter that Donovan is not a qualified hospital administrator or a veteran , he is the brother of John Donovan , chief House counsel and a close friend of House Speaker Thomas W. McGee , ( D-Lynn ) . What made the whole performance more sordid is that McGee and Senate President William M. Bulger ( D-Boston ) were the authors of the bill that was designed to keep extraneous personal matters out of the outside sections of budgets . And when Rep. Royall Switzler ( R-Wellesley ) called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Donovan ' s life tenure was exactly what McGee was aiming at in the bill to control outside sections , the response was that the McGee-Bulger law was not yet in effect ; that new laws don ' t go into effect until 90 days after they have been signed into law by the governor . Thus , the life-tenure poly was legal . But it certainly doesn ' t enhance the image of the Legislature as a government body that means what it says . That wasn ' t the only piece of " major " legislation that was given a high priority during the last two days of the 1981 session . While almost 3000 bills were consigned to a legislative junk heap , the House and Senate dutifully passed a 25 percent pay increase for the register of deeds for Suffolk County . There may be merit to the raise for the register and his assistants , but the action of the Legislature would still appear to be in violation of Proposition 2 , which inveighs against the Legislature ' s imposition of higher costs on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case , the cost will be borne by Suffolk County , which is the city of Boston . Under Proposition 2 , the pay raise should have had the prior approval of the Boston City Council or the state should have come up with the money to meet the increase . Another piece of " major " legislation that whipped through the House and Senate was a bill setting a new date by which the Advisory Board on Legislative , Judicial and Constitutional Officers ' Compensation must file a report and recommendation on pay raises . Unlike the McGee-Bulger bill making budgets more honest , this bill had an emergency preamble that made it effective the minute it was signed into law Tuesday by the governor . It stipulates that the board - which still has not been named must file its report by the first Wednesday in March . A similar bill , which went through the earlier legislative process , called for a report from the board by the first Wednesday of December 1981 . But senatorial dallying delayed passage and it wasn ' t signed into law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been set up , couldn ' t come in with a report by the December deadline . What it all means , though , is that in this election year there could beplans for pay-raise legislation for legislators and state constitutional officers . A pay-raise bill for the judiciary was enacted last month . Even an advisory board that has qualified , serious and nonpolitical members is bound to come up with recommendations for a pay raise because the case for it , in terms of job responsibility , can be made . The question then is whether the Legislature will handle the recommendation openly and forthrightly or resort to the Halloween pay-raise shenanigans of 1979 . That action was struck down on the November 1980 ballot 10 to 1 . In response to that public expression of disgust , a seven-member advisory board was set up to study pay policy for legislators and constitutional officers . It was critical of the Halloween bill but called , nevertheless , for a pay raise . It had other recommendations : It inveighed against the legislative practive of tying legislative pay to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise every time the Legislature gave state employees one . It also called on the Legislature to stop legislating pay raises for itself during the terms for which members were elected . These recommendations were approved by the House but were set aside in the Senate , which means that there is no established policy governing the way legislators deal with their own salaries . Rep. George E. Keverian ( D-Everett ) , majority leader of the House , isn ' t sure what course pay-raise legislation will take this year . " Whether it ' s an election year or not , " he said this week , " there is and always has been a substantial number of people who resent pay raises for public officials and they , of course , will be heard , " But whatever course is followed , legislative pay raises are always an emotional issue for legislators , and this year they will be even more emotional as cities and towns demand more from the Legislature in relief of property taxes .
