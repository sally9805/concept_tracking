Introduced and Edited by Antonia Fraser . A &; W Publishers . 263 pp. $14.95 . Myths , legends , truth ( occcasional ) and romanticism have given the world , and especially the western world , its heroes and heroines . There apparently is in us a deep need to love , to respect , even to worship , and our history has produced many men and women who even deserve a portion of devotion . Only a few are represented here , and of course the choices are both predictable and capricious . If Achilles , why not Aeneas ? If Theseus , why not Perseus ? And why not King Arthur ? ( Theseus was a cad who abandoned Ariadne and Heracles was nothing but boring muscle . ) As others have noted , similar themes run through western folklore and legend : incest , impossible tasks accomplished , trickery , giants , animals , narrow escapes , human sacrifice ; reincarnation , murder and , above all , fate . Ancient Greece takes predominance . But of course there must be English mythic heroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a wizard and precursor of Merlin , and his son Leu , who suffered numerous misfortunes , some rather Heraclian . So does culture travel over land and sea . In addition there was the Irish hero CuChulainn . For those not au courant CuChulainn is pronounced KAH-HOOL-IN . He too performed feats of savage bravery and was doomed by fate . And there was Finn ( from which comes the word Fenian ) . Finn was a Robin Hood type ( though R. Hood did not make it into this book ) and probably gave his name to the Scottish hero Fingal . Interlocking directorates ? Similar fears and fantasies ? Whatever Finn was , he wrote poems while he wasn ' t killing his enemies . And so the tales go on . Thor . Odin . Balder . Then : Classical and Biblical heroes . The Greeks had the definitive word for heroism , but the Jews perhaps began it all with Joshua ( why not Moses , ask I querulously ) , and of course David with his tiny slingshot ( another Robin Hood as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king who defeated the Persians at Thermopylae with 1200 men against 200,000 . All died to save Athens for its Golden Age , and probably to save liberty in the west - for us . The next-in- order hero is Pericles , architect of that Golden Age ; then de rigeur Alexander the Great , Hannibal , Julius Caesar and Spartacus . Next Section : The Age of Chivalry . Amazingly enough , the art , or trade , of public relations was operating even then . King Alfred ( the Great ) is called great because he worked hard on his image . Roland apparently chose to fight ( and die ) because he wanted to be remembered in song . The other nominees ( the book , I ' m afraid , does begin to bring out this reaction ) are Hereward , Saladin , Robert the Bruce , Henry V , Joan of Arc , Columbus , Sir Thomas More . They share one attribute : They are still famous . In fact , this book is composed of mini-biographies of a number of famous people , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until today ) arepreponderantly British ( George Washington and Davy Crockett , Abe Lincoln and Charles Lindbergh are accorded heroic status . And ah yes , Neil Armstrong ) . " Heroes and Heroines " ( 11 of the latter out of a total of 53 from the beginning of recorded time ) is a classifiable book : it is not disgraceful ; I should have reviewed it before Christmas ; it would be a fine gift for an adolescent . Antonia Fraser is also the author of several excellent biographies : of , among other , Cromwell and Mary Queen of Scots . Margaret Manning is book editor of the Globe .
