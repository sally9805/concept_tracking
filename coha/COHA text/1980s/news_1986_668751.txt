Lary Damron , who used the alias " Lary Wright , " while posing undercover as the owner of a service that processed credit card billings for massage parlors , testified that after a series of phone calls beginning in July , 1982 , he finally met Keating Sept. 3 at the Holiday Inn restaurant in Ford City . " I told him I had the money for the month and I asked him if he wanted it then or wanted it later , " Damron said . " I gave him the money , he took it and put it in his pocket , " Damron testified .

It was Marren who introduced Damron to the waitress at the Holiday Inn and set up a monthly delivery plan , explaining that the bills should be wrapped in newspaper and stuffed in an envelope so that a casual observer would not be able to determine that the envelope contained cash , Damron testified . Keating apparently agreed to meet with Damron after Marren was sent to prison following a conviction in federal court for his role in an unrelated conspiracy case involving the theft and forgery of stolen securities . During a telephone conversation between Keating and Damron that was recorded , and played back for the jury , Keating said that he had delivered some of the payoff money to the commissary account at the Metropolitan Correctional Center where Marren was incarcerated .

" On Sept. 2 , 1982 , Keating called Damron to arrange the meeting at the Holiday Inn , according to testimony . " He agreed that he would meet with me . He said he ' d be easy to spot because he was as big as a squadrol , " Damron said . During their conversation at the Holiday Inn , Keating warned Damron against associating with a certain individual who was operating a house of prostitution because that individual had previously testified for the government in a federal corruption case involving former Lake County Sheriff Orville Clavey , Damron said . The agent said that Keating noted , " once a guy has squealed , the second time is always easier. "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
