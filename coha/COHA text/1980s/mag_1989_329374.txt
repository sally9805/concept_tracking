Larry McAfee was an avid outdoorsman . Growing up in south Georgia , he loved to fish , hunt and play baseball . But all that ended in 1985 , when a motorcycle accident left him paralyzed from the neck down . Since then he has lost his zest for living . McAfee , 33 , thus petitioned a Georgia court for permission to turn off the ventilator that has been keeping him alive . As the former civil engineer testified in an emotional bedside hearing last month , he woke up every morning " fearful of each new day . There is nothing I have found or can think of that I really enjoy or that has helped my situation . " <P> Last week McAfee got his wish . Superior Court Judge Edward Johnson of Fulton County , Ga. , ruled that McAfee 's right to refuse life-sustaining treatment outweighed the state 's interest in preserving life . " The ventilator to which he is attached is not prolonging his life ; it is prolonging his death , " said Johnson . With the court 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a friend 's apartment and end his life by using a mouth-activated timer to shut off the ventilator after medical personnel have sedated him . <P> McAfee 's situation has revived a smoldering controversy over whether health- care providers should help the disabled commit suicide . In July a paraplegic in Michigan successfully petitioned a court to have his respirator turned off . Some officials denounced that action , saying it set a dangerous example for the handicapped by encouraging them to end their lives rather than strive for a meaningful existence . In McAfee 's case , Judge Johnson has exonerated anyone who helps the patient carry out his plan . John Banja , a professor of medical ethics at Emory University , notes that hospitals have no clear mandate for " treatment discontinuance , " and the role of doctors and nurses in these affairs remains murky . However , adds Banja , " this is a clear- cut case of a rational adult . The decision lets McAfee decide if his life is meaningful or not . " <P> The McAfee case comes at a time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Most such cases , unlike McAfee 's , involve comatose patients whose families are seeking to withdraw life-support systems . This fall the U.S. Supreme Court will rule on such a situation for the first time when it considers the case of Nancy Cruzan , 32 , a Missouri factory worker who has been in an irreversible vegetative state for six years . The court has been asked to decide whether there is a constitutional right of privacy broad enough to allow Cruzan 's family to disconnect the feeding tubes that nourish her , and thereby to let her die . An alliance of disability-rights activists and antiabortion groups has already begun to clash with patients ' advocates and civil libertarians in what promises to be a bitter battle .
