I DO N'T KNOW Osborn Elliott , who knows everybody , but I have read his memoirs and that 's close enough . He was the editor of Newsweek on and off for many years ? from Bay of Pigs to Jerry Ford ? and his propinquity to events makes him a plausible subject for autobiography . Since last year , Mr. Elliott has been dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism , the profession 's stud farm on Morningside Heights in New York ? a place where living in the past is de rigueur for faculty and staff and where students learn that autobiography is protected speech under the First Amendment . While Mr. Elliott is of mellow age and within his rights to have produced The World of Oz , his many friends should have dissuaded him from spending " the better part of a year typing , " as he puts it , for he has a flaw as a memoirist : While adducing all the evidence Louis Nizer would need in court to prove beyond doubt that Oz is a stuffed shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He might , however , merely be cynical . For his method , apparently deliberate , is to weave false humility , studied naivete , self-effacing humor , braggadocio , and unsolicited testimonial into the impression that there was Oz , perched atop journalism , a truly great man never truly aware of it . Still the fact remains that were it not for Osborn Elliott , America might never have discovered " the racial problem , " " Newsweek 's editorial women " might all still be researchers , and the magazine 's proofreaders might not be allowed in the elevators with their bicycles . Or put out a newspaper with his toy typewriter when he was eight . He got his first job , at New York 's Journal of Commerce , " through pull . " He learned to write , the way he writes , at Time , and at thirty-six he was ready for the coup that made him editor of Newsweek . It was all so simple ; everything comes easy to Oz . His parents were socialites ? members of " New York 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and they were bigots , but then " everyone in their set was " a bigot . Mr. and Mrs. Elliott would n't even have black help . Or went to the best , whites-only schools ? Browning in New York and St. Paul 's in New Hampshire . As his father the stockbroker had done , he attended Harvard , where he got C 's . He had a nodding acquaintance there with a big black part-time bartender . He entered and left the Navy as an ensign , which does not connote progress on his part , but an ensign is an officer , nonetheless , and as such Or did have black servants ? i.e. , steward 's mates . I burlesque the way Oz juxtaposes his privileged but unremarkable life against the circumstances of blacks , because Oz does that himself and because , along about 1963 , Or found himself for the first time thinking deep . ly about racism in America . He also spent a week in the ghetto with Bill Buckley , which he will never forget . E LLIOTT BECAME EDITOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend Ben Bradlee to interest Phil Graham in buying the magazine from the Astors for the Washington Post Company . Bradlee had hyped Oz for the job in a long memo to Graham . Whether Oz at the time of his elevation was a fine editor or merely a successful schemer is uncertain . but by the time he repaired to the Columbia School of Journalism eighteen years later , he had been certified one of the great editors of the Sixties by Teddy White , who worked neither for him nor with him at Newsweek but who is a friend . And he had been called one of the " major journalistic figures " of our time by Kay Graham , who had fired him because he was bored with his work. * Elliott 's firing at the hands of Kay Graham was so congenial , in fact , that it ended with Oz and Kay hugging and kissing . And when Oz 's book about it all was published . they threw a party for him in Newsweek 's rec room . the Top of the Week . Elliott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has so many of his chums saying such sweet things about him in his book that an especially gullible reader might be lured to the thought that Oz is the man he says his friends say he is . Oz has scores of friends to boast of , and for some of them he admits doing occasional little journalistic favors that the voices of sanctimony might regard as improper . As , for example , when he softened a reference to his dear friend Robert Moses , who built the New York World 's Fair and got Or his first job . *Since he was a witness , Elliott can get away with the umpteenth retelling of the Washington Post saga ? the story of how the handsome , lanky , ambitious , electric , witty , brilliant , and manic-depressive Phil Graham married into the rich and powerful Meyer family , became a newspaper tycoon and a friend of Jack Kennedy 's , drank too much , flew off with some Australian tootsie from Newsweek 's Paris bureau , succumbed to depression , and killed himself , leaving the empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have been prepared to take over but who came through like a champ . The occasion for returning the favor was a Newsweek review of a book by Moses : I removed what I considered to be a gratuitously nasty phrase , specified that the Moses review should have top billing in the Books section , and ordered up a particularly attractive picture of Bob Moses that had been in my family 's living room for years . Despite everything , Moses did n't like the review ; he was so mad that he refused to attend the dinner dance Os was planning for his parents ' golden wedding anniversary . Oz 's wife begged the master builder to come . Oz implored the old man to change his mind . " I crawled , " Or recalls , unashamed . Still , Moses would n't dance . As Oz says , it 's " not always easy for an editor to retain friendships , especially among those who are criticized by your magazine . " But God knows Oz tries . Oz says most of his friends are journalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Abe Rosenthal , and Arthur Gelb , in addition to those of Buckley and White . They all have lunch together . The other friends he mentions by name also are eminent friends , as the following sampling from the book , compressed for effect , sug-gests : I loved Phil Graham , he was my friend and boss . . . Graham was a friend of John Kennedy and a friend of Lyndon Johnson ? . I paid a call on Brooke Astor , an old friend ? . . I had known Lippmann as a family friend for years . . . I first hatched the idea ? originally suggested by my friend Schuyler Chapin ? of a survey of Black America . . . I thought of this man President Kennedy I had known only slightly , but who had seemed such a friend ... I was wracked by sobs . . . I loved that president . I was wafted away by my friend Arthur Houghton for a cruise down the Dalmatian coast of Yugoslavia . . . 1 came to know a number of black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . . I bumped into my old friend Blair Clark , who introduced me to David Halberstam . . . Halberstarn and I have become friends ? so much so that I told him far too many anecdotes for his book The Powers That Be ; that was , of course , before I knew I would be writing a book myself . . . 1 had flown up from New York on a Sunday-night shuttle with my friend and fellow Harvard Overseer Teddy White . . My friend Dick Clurman . . . My friend Jim Cannon . . . My friend Arthur Houghton . . One could scream . Oz Elliott 's book is a pamphlet compared with Ratherstam 's , and at fewer than 80,000 words it is not long enough to absorb all this sycophancy . One wonders why his editor ( " Even an editor needs an editor , " writes Oz ) did not , out of friendship , prevail on him to vary the expression , or to mute the impression that grows like a bacterium through the book that Oz is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the end of existence . But , then , why fake it ? Oz says he 's flattered by the access ... to heads of state , artists , and tycoons .. .. I have had interviews with five presidents , audiences with two popes . I was nattered at by Nasser , charmed by Giscard , irritated by Indira ? . I called Leonard " Lenny , " Henry " Henry , " and Teddy Kennedy " Ted . " At Newsweek Oz was always getting little love notes from his friends , praising this or that , and he took them all seriously . He brags about a fan letter he got from Russ Wiggins of the Washington Post , and another he . got from Abe Rosenthal of his luncheon club . Oz says that the most controversial story Newsweek had ever run as of mid-1961 was the cover he mustered up on the John Birch Society and right-wing flakes like Gen. Edwin Walker . The feature was called " Thunder on the Right . " It caused such a stir that advertisers canceled ads . Thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newsweek 's job on the Birchers awfully courageous . " My friend Schuyler Chapin , " Or recalls , was one such admirer . " At last , " he wrote ? in a letter that I picked to lead off the next week 's magazine ? " a responsible journal has taken the obviously difficult and desperately important subject of this country 's lunatic fringe and devoted care to its presentation . " One does n't see in Oz 's rendering of the story what was so remarkable about the fact that a newsmagazine could entertain the thought , even in 1961 , that Eisenhower was not a Cora. munist and that Earl Warren should n't be impeached . Oz does n't realize that the letters his friends wrote to him and that he chose to publish in the magazine ( over thousands of others ) were usually blather . Oz makes quite a point that he disapproves of conflicts of interest and that he avoided them at Newsweek whenever they involved Harvard University . But Oz does n't recognize corruption when he steps in it . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bradlee ( played by Jason Robards in the movie ) was a crony of President Kennedy 's . " Some second-thinkers , " Oz writes , " have since charged that this closeness led Newsweek to bend too sympathetically toward the people and policies of the Kennedy regime . I did n't believe so then , and I do n't believe so now . " Oz was on to Bradlee and watched him closely . This assurance is conveyed on page 21 of the Oz book . By page 45 of the galleys I read . but strangely missing from the published book , old Oz has moved on from the subject of incorruptibility and has other points to make . As President Kennedy , assassinated , is being laid to rest , Oz does some reminiscing . Since the passage did n't make it into hardcover , quote it here entirely : Listening to Taps , watching the coffin descend , I thought of a private briefing session I had had with John Kennedy in the Oval Office , a year or so before . I was setting of on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was almost routine in those days ( particularly if Ben Bradlee was your bureau chief in Washington ) for an editor to receive such presidential courtesy . Jack Kennedy was relaxed , talking politics , talking magazine circulation , talking of a particularly sensitive story about his private life anallegation that he had been secretly married once before . The story had appeared in a few hate sheets , and Ben Bradlee and I had decided to confront the president with it . Kennedy agreed to have the FBI files on the matter delivered to Bradlee at a motel in Newport , Rhode Island , one night ; Bradlee was to return the files to nearby Hammersmith Farm , Jackie Kennedy 's family place , by 7:00 a.m , the next day , and there the president would read the story . Tapping a fingernail on his front teeth , Kennedy had scanned the piece and given his okay . The article recounted the rumors in detail , then proceeded to refute them ; it appeared in Newsweek 's Press section ? always a convenient place to tut-tut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories into print . And as I sat there in Kay Graham 's office , at the moment of Kennedy 's burial , I remembered how absurdly my Oval Office session with the president had ended . " I think you fellows handled that marriage ' story pretty well , " he said . And then I heard myself say , to my horror : " Well , we had to keep a tight asshole on that one , Mr. President . " I can see why this gaffe , this indiscretion , did not find its way to the bookstores . It 's rather explosive , is n't it ? The president of the United States was , in the full knowledge of News-week 's top editor , allowed to do the final editing of a potentially scandalous piece about himself . It 's as if Ben Bradlee were clearing Woodward and Bernstein stories with Richard Nixon . At the very least , the anecdote does not support the argument heretofore broached by Oz that he was watching Bradlee for just such hanky-panky , and it gives the lie to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally , and furthermore , it provides the one and only example I intend to give of Oz Elliott 's irrepressible dirty mouth , which is much in evidence throughout the book . Oz seems never to have recovered from the Kennedys . He wrote a letter to Mr. and Mrs. Onassis in which he practically pleaded with them to grant an interview to Arnaud de Borchgrave , a Newsweek correspondent . When Teddy Kennedy drove off the bridge at Chappaquiddick , Oz did not clear the story with the senator but , once he had published it , wrote him a billet-doux declaring that Newsweek had no vendetta against him . Indeed , Oz says his files are full of " fawning letters " he has written to celebrities . 0 Z ELLIOTT IS interesting because he had charge of a magazine with a circulation approaching 3 million . People get their news from it and are influenced by it . He is not interesting as acelebrity ; he is n't one . On the dust jacket of his book , there is a David Levine caricature of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a famous face or figure . Accordingly , I do n't think readers will care much what his friend Harriet did for him with her hand when he was fourteen , or that his first wife was Catholic and his second wife Jewish . I do n't see why anyone would care to know the names of the many restaurants he frequents ? he 's not Mimi Sheraton ? or to hear about all the martinis down the hatch in the past twenty years . What matters about a guy like Oz Elliott is the power he wields ? wielded , in his case -- and the purposes to which it is put . Unfortunately , The World of Oz is in large part merely a surface history of the Sixties and early Seventies as seen in the pages of Newsweek . In Oz 's rendition it is a pedestrian history and all the more tedious because the period between Kennedy 's inauguration and Nixon 's rustication has been so thoroughly picked over by writers . An analysis of Newsweek 's world view and influence could be fascinating . What one gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , raps about how brave it was to cover the radical Right , boasts about how revolutionary it was to poll blacks . One gets Elliott 's disingenuous confessions that he was slow to do right by the women who worked under him , and that it took him forever to turn against the war that he 'd seen up close from General Westmoreland 's helicopter . Elliott wanted his book , he said , to be instructive to persons who have taken " more than a passing interest " in current events . But no more than a passing interest is asked or exhibited . The author is quite satisfied with superficial reality , face value , and looking good . For example , take the one topic of the Sixties Elliott claims to have cared most about ? race . He realized blacks had it bad in this society sometime in 1962. whereupon he acted on his perceptions . He encouraged his daughter 's private school to integrate itself . He recruited black journalists . He had Louis Harris do a survey of blacks ' attitudes , which Oz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monolithic thing . When Newsweek did its first " NEGRO IN AMERICA " cover , Oz told his readers that " until now , not even Negro leaders could say for sure what the Negro 's goals are . " How quaint that Oz thought Newsweek could , but Oz claims to have actually believed that what Lou Harris had done for him was " the deepest study of the American dilemma since Gunnar Myrdal . " What the issue revealed , according to Oz , is that the black revolution was a deeply rooted national phenomenon aimed at ending discrimination in every field and deriving much of its strength from black churches preaching patriotism and cooperation with whites . Also discovered was that black people had heroes ? Martin Luther King , Jr. , Jackie Robinson ? and that most blacks voted for Kennedy against Nixon in 1960 . Yes , deep . The letters ? complimentary ones ? came pouring in . " Meaningful , " wrote Abe Rosenthal of the Times . " Marvelous , " chimed in Russ Wiggins of the Post . " Suddenly , Newsweek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Newsweek later followed up this triumph by announcing " WHAT THE WHITE MAIN THINKS OF THE NEGRO REVOLT . " " The white man " ? he , too , a composite ? " is eternally torn between the right that he knows and the wrong that he does . " And so on . As late as 1966 , the Newsweek of Osborn Elliott was still speaking of the white man and the black man as cardboard silhouettes . When riots broke out in Detroit , Oz decided that for the first time in thirty-four years , the magazine should take an editorial position that would offer solutions to what he still calls in 1980 " the racial problem . " " In the end , " Oz recalls , " we turned out a twenty-two-page section that blended reportage with analysis . . and ended with a twelve-point program for action . " In his memoirs he does n't say what the twelve points were . He does mention that the issue " made news everywhere " and won a National Magazine Award . T WO LAST MATTERS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eugene McCarthy winning the New Hampshire primary in 1968 . McCarthy did not win in New Hampshire . He got 42 percent of the vote , to President Johnson 's 48.5 . This may have been a moral victory for McCarthy or a Pyrrhic victory for LBJ , but Oz is wrong on the result if what he is counting is votes . Second , the new dean of the Columbia School of Journalism has done some boning up on press law since galley proofs of his book went out to reviewers . In the galleys , Oz wrote : The press has no privilege under the Constitution , but the people do . They have the right to know what is going on in their neighborhoods , in their towns , and in their country . Now that may sound good , but it is n't true , and someone must have explained that to the dean . The First Amendment says : " Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech or of the press . " The error corrected , Oz now says : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection is really for the people . They have the right to know what is going on in their neighborhoods , in their towns , and in their country . That 's not quite true either , but it 'll do .
