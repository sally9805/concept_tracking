Fear of crime transforms home protection into a runaway growth industry <P> In Phoenix , metal lawn signs in front of homes warn burglars that gun-wielding guards will greet them if they enter . In Cleveland , a school for canines turns tail-wagging family pooches into snarling guard dogs . In Los Angeles , uniformed attendants at a bunker-like command post study screens and consoles day and night , watching for signs of home break-ins . When an alarm goes off , they lift a red telephone to summon police , or bark out a microphone command that dispatches members of their own gun-toting security force . <P> Across the U.S. , the rising fear of crime has turned the once sluggish home-security business into a runaway growth industry . Sales of burglar alarms and other residential safeguards have zoomed to nearly $900 million a year , up from $500 million in 1979 , and are expanding at the dazzling annual rate of about 30% . Firms in the field range from industrial giants like Honeywell ( 1982 sales : $4.6 billion ) to one-person outfits selling burglar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rich , they are now being eagerly sought by the less affluent . Says H. Tim Crow , vice president and secretary of Atlanta-based Rollins Protective Services ( fiscal 1983 sales : $28.5 million ) , a supplier of detection equipment and services : " Yes , we 're still protecting the wealthy-athletes , entertainers , top executives , the heirs to fortunes . We 've always protected them . But now we are also protecting the middle class , or the man who is retired and lives with his wife on a pension . " A survey commissioned earlier this year by Security Distributing and Marketing , a trade publication , found that of some 42 million homes in the U.S. , no fewer than 3 million had residential-alarm installations . Some 2 million of those were homes worth $100,000 or less . <P> A typical electronic surveillance system costs about $3,000 . For that the homeowner gets a network of sensors that can detect break-ins . An intruder sets off a piercingly loud alarm and triggers a signal in the central monitoring station or at a police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month . <P> For some wealthy people , electronic surveillance is not enough . They have taken refuge from crime inside enclaves that , like medieval towns , are surrounded by walls . The homes inside are generally protected by alarms as well . Such " gated-off " compounds include the likes of MountainGate ( pop . 400 ) , a condominium complex in Southern California , and the Palm Beach County community of Golf ( pop . 110 ) in Florida . <P> Elsewhere , some frightened citizens are resorting to less elaborate precautions . In the Cleveland suburb of Garfield Heights , Nuns Mary Assumpta and Augustine Marie recently enrolled their Siberian husky Tanya in the nearby Inter national School for Dogs . For about $500 per pet , that academy teaches normally docile canines to bark , growl and bite . " We 've had occasions when there have been people trying doors , " says Sister Mary of her 32-bedroom convent . At the school , Head Trainer Howard Denton said business stayed strong even during the recession . " Any dog can do protection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they wo n't kissy-face everybody .
