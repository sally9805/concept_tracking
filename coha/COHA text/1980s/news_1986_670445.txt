Some were eating dinner when a cloud of poisonous volcanic gas erupted Thursday night and slowly choked them . Others tried to outrun the toxic cloud and were discovered by rescue workers lying in the mud along the dirt road leading out of town. // Still more were found sprawled with other family members in front of their homes . They had been unable to stagger any farther . Before dying , they had stripped themselves of clothing in a desperate attempt to escape the searing heat of the volcanic cloud. // This account emerged today from interviews with rescue workers and survivors in Souboum , one of the four villages whose population was almost wiped out when a geyser of volcanic gas shot up through Lake Nios and descended onto the thatched huts and mud-brick homes in the valley below . <> <> Toll Is Put at 1 , 500 // The first reporters to reach the disaster zone were taken there today in Cameroon Army helicopters. // Cameroon officials and rescue workers said about 1 , 500 died in the disaster , which took place Thursday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Geneva , the United Nations Disaster Relief Office increased its count of the dead to 1 , 534 and said the disaster affected 20 , 000 people in the area . The figures came from an official working in the area for the relief office and for the United Nations Development Program . An exact death toll will never be known . The army has not kept exact records of those it has buried , and many victims were buried by relatives soon after the disaster . The Government tolls are based in part on estimates of how many people lived in the affected villages and how many seem to have survived . <> <> Troops and Inmates Dig Graves // Most of the bodies have been buried in individual or mass graves dug by army units and prison inmates chosen for the task , army officials said. // The bloated carcasses of hundreds of cattle lay clustered in pastures today around the affected villages . The herds can be removed only when heavy equipment reaches the stricken area , about 50 miles northwest of the provincial capital , Bamenda. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is about five miles north of Lake Nios , eight members of a family were buried in their front yard . Their living quarters were strewn with overturned pots and furniture , a mess probably created by people writhing in agony as the gas strangled them. // In the front yard a chicken danced around the fresh dirt atop the family ' s grave , pecking away for crumbs of food . A sign on the door read , " Come in with peace. " // " The goats , the pigs , the cows , the men - all died , " said Lieut . Gen. James Tataw , chief of the Cameroon Army ' s land forces and commander of the rescue operation . " Only that chicken survived . We don ' t know how. " // " If you would have come here three days ago , or two days ago , " added General Tataw , " you would have seen people the same way as you see cattle now . There are mass graves because we only had a few laborers and we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty hole and collect all the bodies and put them in , " he added . " Those who have individual graves , those were dug for them by their relatives . The cows have no relatives , so their burials will be last . " <> <> Once Shimmering , Now Muddy // Lake Nios was once a deep blue mountain lake that local residents referred to as " the good lake " because of its shimmering color . Shaped like a lemon , it is about 500 yards long and 250 yards wide and fills the crater of a supposedly extinct volcano. // Those flying over the lake today in a Cameroon Army helicopter saw that it had turned to a muddy reddish brown as a result of the volcanic material pushed up by the gas that shot through the lake bed . Its sickly looking waters stood out in sharp contrast to the lush green vegetation and forests of palm trees that cover the rest of the area. // A few of the 300 to 400 inhabitants of Souboum and the surrounding area managed to survive the toxic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dioxide and hydrogen sulfide . The villages closer to the lake were even less fortunate. // In a valley about 500 yards north of the lake is the village of Nios , whose 1 , 200 people are believed to have been killed by the poison cloud , save for one woman and her child who somehow survived . Two other villages in the valley , Cha and Sang , were also devastated when the gas spread over about four square miles in which some 5 , 000 people were believed to live. // Chia David Wambong , an elderly resident of Souboum , was one of the few survivors in his village . Sitting in his front yard today next to a heap of clothing , he told reporters that he was at home with his family when the eruption occurred around 9 : 30 P.M. // " We felt warm , " he said . " I felt as if I was drunk . The smell was like cooking with kitchen gas . Everyone seemed like they were drunk . Everyone started to cough , and some people vomited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People were falling . Everyone was crying . " Another survivor , 30-year-old Dennis Chin , returned to Souboum today to recover some belongings from his home . The gas cloud has dissipated and the air is safe to breathe , although the army is advising residents not to eat anything growing on trees. // Mr. Chin said he was lying in his bed when the poison descended on the village . " I woke up , I sit in bed and breathe : huh , huh , huh , huh , " he said , imitating someone gasping for air. // He said he had survived by managing in a stupor to drag himself into a windowless shed behind his house. // Col. Michael Wiener , an Israeli Army doctor , said many of the survivors in the valley below the lake , such as in Souboum , may simply have been in an air current that did not have any poison , while someone standing only a few yards away may have been killed. // Dr. Weiner , the head of a 17-member rescue unit that came to Cameroon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team to Nkamba , about 100 miles northeast of Bamenda . There they will work alongside Cameroonian doctors to study the nature of the poisoning and assist in treating the injured . A team of French scientists is also on hand to study how the eruption might have occurred. // According to Cameroon officials , 180 people are being treated in a hospital in Nkamba and another 100 or so are hospitalized in the town of Wum . Many of the injured were burned by the heat and chemicals in the gas. // Whether in the capital , Yaounde , or in the northwest provinces where the disaster occurred , there seems to be much concern and some curiosity about what took place , but no apparent agony or national mourning . The main article this morning in The Cameroon Tribune was not about the volcanic disaster , but about President Paul Biya ' s meeting on Monday with Mr. Peres. // It takes only one trip to the affected region to understand why there was so little information for so long . None of the villages have electricity or telephones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is reached only by crude dirt roads. // Because communications and travel are so difficult , word of the disaster did not reach the nearby major towns until late Friday or early Saturday , which is apparently why many people thought it occurred on Friday . <> <> Some Homes Yet to Be Checked // Not all of those who died lived right in the villages , which are made up of little more than brick huts with corrugated tin or thatched roofs built along 200 yards of road . Many other people , most of them simple farmers , lived in small family clusters in the surrounding hills , and some of their homes have yet to be checked for casualties. // According to Gideon Taka , the delegate for education and culture in Bamenda , the first word of the disaster was brought by a Government employee who was returning from Wum to the village of Nios , about five miles away , on Friday afternoon . The man was riding a motorcycle on the road from Wum when he suddenly came across a small dead antelope. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mr. Taka . So the man strapped the animal onto his motorcycle and kept riding , Mr. Taka said . Soon , however , he came upon some dead bodies and cattle and began to feel sick . After a time , he made his way back to Wum , despite his own dizziness , and told the authorities what had happened. //
