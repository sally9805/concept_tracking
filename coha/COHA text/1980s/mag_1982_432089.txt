 | The trim white ranch house on the quiet side street in Berkeley , Calif. , looks just like its modest neighbors ? except for a bright red ramp that curves gently from curb to doorway . The ramp makes a graphic declaration of independence for the spirited young woman who lives there . Ten years ago Dottie SantaPaul was considered a hopeless invalid , confined forever to a nursing-home bed by amotonia congenita , a rare disease that destroys muscle tone . Today , thanks to a combination of her own grit and some innovative assistance , the 33-year-old paraplegic has both a full-time counseling job and a home of her own . " I 'm a very happy person , " says SantaPaul , who pilots her motorized wheelchair down the ramp every weekday to commute to work by van . " I have a pretty ordinary life . " For most handicapped Americans , ordinary life remains an extraordinary achievement . During the 1970s landmark legislation brought many of the nation 's 36 million disabled citizens closer to the mainstream of American life . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective civil-rights movement that reached a symbolic high point when th'e United Nations declared 1981 the " International Year of Disabled Persons . " The designation spurred some significant progress abroad , particularly in Third World countries . But at home the year of the disabled was hardly a vintage one . A decade of hard-won gains was threatened by Federal budget cuts , deregulation and a backlash of public opinion . " I hope to hell handicapped people never have to endure another year of the disabled , " says Mason Rose , former chairman of a Federal watchdog group established to make sure that public facilities are accessible to the handicapped . " We lost more rights last year than any other . " The handicapped have long fought against artificial barriers that make it difficult for them to lead productive lives . Some are physical obstructions that keep those in wheelchairs from classrooms or subways . Others are psychological blocks that pre- vent the disabled from getting jobs or promotions . Three key Federal laws passed in the last decade seemed to assure the destruction of those barriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rights for the disabled . It barred any recipient of Federal aid from discriminating against the handicapped , architecturally as well as economically . To enforce the law , the Federal Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board was created . In 1975 a special-education law was passed requiring schools to " mainstream " handicapped students into regular classes wherever possible . And in 1980 the Social Security Act was temporarily amended to allow the disabled to earn more than $280 a month without forfeiting their government assistance . However tough the laws appear on paper . they have been weakened by scanty funding and slack enforcement . Some programs have never been fully funded ; for example , though the Federal government is supposed to be paying 30 percent of New York City 's school-mainstreaming costs , it paid only 12 percent last year . Others have been cut back sharply : California recently lost a $28 million-a-year Federal grant for a program that permits the severely disabled to live and work outside institutions . In addition , the Reagan Administration tried to abolish the Carter-appointed compliance board and scuttle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a board compromise put off the most controversial regulations . In addition , the Administration left transit issues up to local officials . Private Sector : Many activists fear there are heavier losses to come . " Washington 's ultraconservative mood gives license for restrictive action , " says James L. Cherry , president of the National Center for Handicapped Rights . Some worry that an austerity-minded Congress might refuse to extend the social-security amendments and abandon other programs . Without Federal pressure , activists say , employers may stop seeking out qualified handicapped workers , and cities may not install or maintain expensive equipment designed to improve access . Advocates of the cutbacks contend that many programs for the handicapped are extravagant and inefficient . The Congressional Budget Office , for example , estimates that renovating old subway systems to make them accessible to wheelchairs would cost @#  | $44 per disabled rider , as opposed to $9 for a special van system . In any case , the Administration insists that it is not abandoning the handicapped . " We 're working to get the private sector to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says C. Boyden Gray , legal counsel to the White House task force on regulatory reform . Indeed , the White House has sponsored a private program to encourage business to train and hire more handicapped workers . Opposition : But volunteerism may not be enough . Many employers still balk at giving disabled people meaningful jobs , acting on the mistaken assumption that handicapped workers will be absent more often than their able-bodied colleagues . And some Americans resent what they see as excessive demands for special privileges in a shrinking economy . It is this sort of opposition , activists say , that turns physical disabilities into true handicaps . " This scares us , " says Doe West , the wheelchairbound executive director of the Boston Commission on the Physically Handicapped . " But we refuse to go back to pity and fear . " In response to the changed mood in Washington , disabled activists are changing their tactics to emphasize their desire for self-reliance . Economics has become a popular pitch : lobbyists frequently argue that every dollar spent on helping the handicapped to find ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We have to make people understand that if they invest in handicapped people , it 's money in their pocket , " says Frank Bowe , a deaf attorney who was chairman of the U.S. delegation to the U.N . ' s year of the disabled . Lobbying efforts have also become more sophisticated : in Texas , a ' new " disabled but able to vote " registration 84 drive is targeting Congressional friends and foes . " It used to be that if you took ten people with white canes to the legislature , you could get them to do anything you wanted , " says Mary Ellen Reihin , whose blindness has not kept her from pursuing a career as an aide to the speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives . " Now it 's more complex ; legislators have begun to accept what we 've been saying , that we are people like everybody else . " Nowhere do the handicapped blend in more smoothly than at Berkeley . A decade ago disabled students at the University of California campus there founded a Center for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the handicapped-rights movement , referring people to jobs and apartments , dispensing encouragement and legal advice and providing a model for at least 150 similar centers around the country . Force : Today Berkeley is a mecca for the disabled . Fourteen percent of its population of 100,000 are handicapped . Not surprisingly , they form a potent political force . As a result , two-thirds of the city 's intersections have either wheelchair ramps or curb cuts . The Bay Area Rapid Transit System , connecting Berkeley with San Francisco , is fully accessible to people in wheelchairs , as are all buildings constructed in the last ten years ; even the automated tellers at local banks are built at wheelchair height . " It 's easy to forget you 're in a wheelchair here , " says Dottie SantaPaul , who moved to Berkeley from Massachusetts five years ago . " But in most small towns , where the disabled are n't as prevalent , it 's not the same story . " Many activists hope the Berkeley story eventually will be repeated elsewhere . " People have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this world because they are uncomfortable around them , " says William L. Cobb , personnel 4 director of Scientific Atlanta , a high-technology communications company that has 400 disabled employees . Cobb maintains that such attitudes are easy to change . " After you have a few disabled workers around , " he says , " the awkwardness disappears . " If familiarity is all that 's needed , then the cause of handicapped rights got a boost from such recent television dramas as " The Ordeal of Bill Carney , " the true story of a divorced quadriplegic 's court battle for custody of his two sons , which was shown on Christmas Eve . " I have more time to spend with the boys than most fathers . I have more patience for them , " says Carney , who won his appeal last year . " The first things a handicapped person learns are patience and tolerance . " Back Doors : Yet patience is seldom inexhaustible , especially when dreams that were once encouraged are denied . " All of us raised in the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Evan Kemp , head of the Disabled Rights Center . " The new generation of disabled expects more . " " The day before my accident , I could walk in the front door , " says Mason Rose , who became a paraplegic while training fighter pilots for Vietnam . " The next day , they told me that because I was injured , I 'd have to use the freight entrance . Well , I 'll not accept the back doors of America , having given all but my life in defense of it . " Economic and social forces may resist them , but the disabled will ' ; keep on knocking at the front door . @#
