WE THE VICTORS by Curtis Bill Pepper Doubleday ; 322 pages ; $17.95 <P> LIFE AND DEATH ON 10 WEST by Eric Lax <P> Times Books ; 267pages ; $14.95 <P> As Critic Susan Sontag has pointed out , cancer unjustly serves as a metaphor for the monstrosities of our age . In human discourse , it is the epithet for all that is demonic , mysterious and implacable in the experience of man and society . Given this aura of dread , these two serious books of medical popularization-the first is subtitled The Inspiring Stories of People Who Conquered Cancer and How They Did It , the second is an account of a pioneering leukemia treatment-represent significant acts of demystification . <P> By dispensing the good tidings of ever more effective treatment , both books serve to dispel the paralyzing terror that the very word cancer engenders .

" Many doctors who do not specialize in cancer fail to keep up with the latest treatment strategies and often lack the connections needed for speedy referral to a cancer center . Some subscribe to the principle " let them die in peace , " thus discouraging patients from seeking care that may prolong their lives . <P> An attentive and compassionate listener , Pepper has constructed his book around interviews with former cancer patients at Memorial . These survivors offer considerable testimony of bad or even potentially fatal medical advice proffered by the physicians they saw first . Estelle Marsicano was scoffed at by her family doctor . " My liver is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When John Alexion consulted a prominent urologist about his prostate cancer , the patient recalled , " the elderly doctor proceeded to lay a bomb on me . The only procedure he would consider was surgical castration and radical removal of the prostate . I thought , ' Jesus ... they 're going to turn me into a 6-ft. eunuch ! ' " At Memorial , however , a surgeon decided on an experimental procedure : inserting capsules of radioactive iodine into Alexion 's prostate instead of removing the gland . It worked .
