Panel votes to expel Williams <P> The U.S. Senate was only eight years old when it first expelled a member . <P> The crime committed by William Blount of Tennessee : inciting Indians to attack the Spanish colonies of Florida and Louisiana . Since then another 14 Senators have been ousted , all for their treasonous support of the South in the Civil War . By comparison , Harrison Williams ' involvement in the Abscam bribery scandal seems rather prosaic . But last week all six members of the Senate Ethics Committee recommended that Williams , 61 , become the 16th Senator in history-and the first in 119 years-to get the heave-ho . <P> The committee made its decision after reviewing videotapes and other evidence of the New Jersey Senator 's dealings with undercover FBI agents . The tapes , which caused a sensation during Williams ' trial in federal court last April , show him meeting with an agent dressed in sheik 's clothes and boasting of his close ties to then President Carter and other officials . The panel , like the federal jury , concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share in a Virginia titanium mine , attempting to obtain a $100 million loan for the venture , and promising to use his influence to secure government contracts for the mine and immigration papers for the bogus sheik . His conduct , said Chairman Malcolm Wallop , " was ethically repugnant to the point of warranting his expulsion . " <P> Still , in one respect , the Senators gave their colleague a break . They recommended that the Senate postpone the vote on expulsion until Federal Judge George Pratt has ruled on an appeal of Williams ' conviction , probably by November . The Senator has claimed that he was " entrapped " by federal agents , who led him to commit crimes he was not otherwise disposed to commit . Says he : " There are major matters still confronting the court . " <P> These matters may not impress Judge Pratt . Four of the six U.S. Representatives stung by Abscam made similar appeals in his court and lost . Of the six , only one , Michael Myers of Philadelphia , has been expelled from the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections . Williams believes that his case is the strongest : tapes show that he refused a bribe from FBI agents and that a bureau informant coached him to " tell anything " to the sheik . Should his appeal fail , Williams will probably resign . Expulsion , as the Senator glumly admits , would mean an unwanted " note in the history books , " though it would not affect his pension-a generous $43,500 a year .
