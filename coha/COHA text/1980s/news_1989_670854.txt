During the primary campaign this summer , Mr. Giuliani consistently attacked Mr. Koch , charging that he had responded to corruption allegations in his administration with " his eyes closed , his ears clogged and his mouth open . " But on the stump this week , Mr. Giuliani lavished praise on Mr. Koch ' s budget modification plan , noting that several of the Mayor ' s proposals , like a hiring freeze and the refinancing of city bonds , were ones he had also offered. // Mr. Giuliani , the Republican and Liberal Party candidate , also went out of his way to commend the Mayor for putting forward the budget plan , and not leaving the chore entirely to his successor. // The change in Mr. Giuliani ' s tone comes on the heels of polls showing that many people who supported Mr. Koch in the Democratic primary are uneasy about the candidate who won it , David N. Dinkins , the Manhattan Borough President . <> <> Concentrating on Koch Strongholds // Lately Mr. Giuliani has been concentrating his campaigning in former Koch strongholds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has invoked Mr. Koch ' s name in places like the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn , where this week he defended his support of a controversial plan to build a garbage incinerator there . In a campaign stop , he told opponents of the plant that he might reconsider his stance should new facts come to light during the final approval process. // Otherwise , he said , the residents should assume " that I take the same position as Ed Koch. " // It is on the issue of corruption , however , that the contrast between the searing anti-Koch rhetoric of the summer and the demurrals of the autumn is most pronounced. // In August , for example , Mr. Giuliani sought to tie the Mayor to corrupt officials like Stanley M. Friedman and the late Donald R. Manes . " If the Mayor had not turned over the Parking Violations Bureau to two of the biggest crooks in the city ' s history , there would have been $200 to $250 million more in revenues , " Mr. Giuliani said then. // Yet when he talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bensonhurst Thursday , Mr. Giuliani tried to avoid mentioning the Mayor ' s name . Declaring that the city ' s " political leadership " had not done enough to root out corruption , he accused Mr. Dinkins of " having an attitude of wanting to see no evil , hear no evil. " // Only when pressed to elaborate on " political leadership " did Mr. Giuliani include the Mayor among the politicians who he said had failed to prevent corruption . Even then , the candidate hastily added that " in Ed Koch ' s case , he worked hard on corruption involving the inspection services and the inspectors in this city. " // " I know because I worked on those cases with him , " Mr. Giuliani said . He was apparently alluding to a 1984 city investigation that resulted in charges against city inspectors for accepting bribes from electrical , sewage and water contractors. // Moving the cross hairs away from a target is not unusual in any election campaign , and , as Mr. Giuliani ' s advisers point out , their foe is Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Dinkins slew the dragon , Dinkins became the opponent , not Ed Koch , " said the Liberal Party Chairman , Raymond Harding . <> <> Nothing Negative From Reformer // But Mr. Giuliani ' s reluctance to criticize Mayor Koch has resulted in the unusual situation in which a self-proclaimed reformer is saying nothing negative about the man who for 12 years presided over the city he wants to clean up . Behind his change in tactics are a number of possible reasons. // One is that Mr. Giuliani wants voters to regard him as the same kind of forceful , decisive leader as the Mayor has been perceived to be , in contrast to Mr. Dinkins , who has been seen as cautious and deliberate . Mr. Giuliani also seeks to identify himself with the Mayor as a tight-fisted fiscal conservative in financial hard times. // For his part , Mr. Dinkins seldom mentions Mr. Koch ' s name , but when he does , it is often to commend him for his restrained tone during the primary . Mr. Koch has endorsed Mr. Dinkins . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be trying to capture the votes of those who had backed Mr. Koch . A New York Times-WCBS-TV survey of voters as they were leaving the polls on primary day indicted that 62 percent of those who said they voted for Mr. Koch said they would not vote for Mr. Dinkins if he were the party ' s nominee . Of those , 16 percent said they would sit out the election. // While primary polls are often unreliable because they can not predict how many voters will turn out on the day of the general election , political advisers often take those indications seriously . <> <> Koch Voters Could Swing Election // " Many of the people who voted for Koch in the primary could very well be a swing vote in ther general election , " said David Garth , the Mayor ' s longtime media adviser . " It makes no sense to antagonize them. " // Mr. Giuliani ' s campaign strategists deny any direct link between the candidate ' s desire to attract Koch supporters and his reluctance to attack the Mayor . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We all know how to read and to listen , " said Mr. Harding . " We ' ve read and listened to exit polls that said many of those who voted for Koch could not support Dinkins. " // Finally , the Giuliani campaign may be adopting a milder stance toward the Mayor because it believes that the public ' s general attitude toward Mr. Koch is softening now that he is leaving office . A poll conducted at the end of September by Peter Hart Research Associates indicated that 44 percent of the voters viewed the Mayor favorably , although 57 percent of blacks gave him negative ratings . In the spring , a number of polls concluded that about 60 percent of the voters rated the Mayor negatively. // And how does Mr. Koch feel about Mr. Giuliani ' s praise ? " A gracious comment deserves a gracious response , " Mr. Koch said . " Thank you , Rudy. " //
