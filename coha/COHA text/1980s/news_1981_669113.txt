As a partner now in Design Multiples , his own firm , he is more convinced of this argument than ever : " To me , everything is a bit of drama , though I have to be careful where I say that because some people miss the point by thinking I mean something superficial , artificial , or bizarre. // " What I really mean are all the little effects that give a decor a change of pace , such as the bright yellow and blue and white Dhurri area rug in my living room . Or the little visual surprises that involve small treasures used in unexpected ways or places . Or a cluster of paintings on a wall . Or a decorative tree lighted from beneath by a cannister lamp , silhouetting its leaves on the ceiling . Or an antique patchwork quilt folded casually over the end of a daybed . Or a weaving loom or a 19th-century chaise given center stage in a sunny alcove . Theater in the home is really just learning to present ourselves and our environment in a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his stint on stage ( he was a juvenile actor who played one of the red-headed sons in " Life With Father " ) had always served as useful background to his later career in interior design . " I learned at an early age that the word ' projection ' meant that the role I was playing had to come over the footlights . Later I saw that the home I made for myself , and helped others make for themselves , had to project an image " over the footlights " as well . That image , which reflected real life and not make-believe , had to project comfort , hospitality , hobbies , and interests , and the bright vitality of color and pattern . I saw that this projection could stir imagination , or arrest the attention in some specific manner , or illuminate some personal aspect of a rich life . It could convey a mood , or define a life style. " // It is Mr. Bell ' s belief that " the success of both an interior and a theatrical production depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior design as a means of putting furniture , accessories , colors , and fabrics together in a way that infuses this indefinable quality . The details of this dramatic interplay keep changing , of course , as people continue to grow and branch out , add on , or subtract. " // To dramatize his own living quarters , a handsome East 60s apartment that doubles as a place of business , Mr. Bell added beams to his living room ceiling . They give him , he says , " more a feeling of house and home . " He put sleek modern wicker and chrome chairs around a rustic old oak farm table that serves for **25;7503;TOOLONG purposes . Even with city dirt to flight , he dared to cover French chairs in a bright yellow upsholstery and has never been sorry . He likes the contrast of pillows covered in a cotton batik print to toss against the plain fabric of chairs and armless modern sofas. // He features a " dramatic little mixture " of books , and framed small pictures , photographs , drawings , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porcelain , American Indian pots , and carved angles from old Mexico on the open shelves of his large and dark Welsh dresser. // Mr. Bell had a series of cube pedestals in many sizes painted pale gray . These are props that lend themselves to assorted and ever-changing effects . They can be bunched together or placed separately . A high one displays a stunning life-size head in the art deco style . A low one in front of a sofa holds a quaint antique Japanese sewing basket // " Certainly your own hobby can always serve as a dramatic focal point , " Mr. Bell observes , spreading out his own needlepoint tapestries and skeins of bright wool , and explaining that he is preparing a show of his work for a New York art gallery. // This designer obviously mixes many styles and periods , but he urges , " Don ' t let the word ' eclectic ' fool you . It ' s tricky business and it doesn ' t just happen . You really have to know what goes with what . It took me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own satisfaction . The right arrangement took time and trial and error to evolve and come together . Now the wall gives me great pleasure and every picture speaks to me . One painting even determined my total color scheme of gray , white , and blue , with red and blue. " // All walls are white , " to show off the art work to advantage , " except the walls of his bedroom-study , which are finished with a dark brown glaze because this room is his " escape hatch " and its cool serenity gives him repose. // Mr. Bell uses no window treatments except Levolor blinds because , he says , " the views of the city are so wonderful . Why cover them up ? " He thinks that even wastebaskets can make their modest impact and cites , as an example , the handwoven tribal basket in a corner of his living room . He found it for $2 in a dark corner of an antique shop. // He again proves his point that there are plenty of dramatic effects that are vastly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small pile of smooth pebbles he has collected in his travels . " These pebbles say something about my love of nature . And I love looking at them and handling them . To me , they evoke a whole little theater of hiking and beach experiences. " // Mr. Bell is currently the president of the Metropolitan New York Chapter of the American Society of Interior Designers . He and his partner , Donald Cotter , are at present involved not only with the design of residences , but of offices , showrooms , and total graphics packages , including company logos. // As a parting shot , Mr. Bell advises , " Tell people not to be afraid to give vent to their imagination . It is far better to do something than to do nothing at all . Of course , part of the reward of being an interior designer is to help people do it better and to expose them to a lot of new ideas , and to teach them how to look , look , look . When you learn to look , you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can express in your home. " // //
