Last month the nonaligned countries , now numbering nearly 100 , held their seventh triennial summit in New Delhi . It was probably the largestgathering of heads of state or government ever assembled . The group was founded in 1955 by Tito , Nehru and Nasser - the first summit was held in 1961 - to create a " third force " in the world , aligned withneither superpower . The movement now includes most " Third World " countries , though there are some notable exceptions , including Brazil , China , Mexico , the Philippines , South Korea , Thailand and Venezuela . As has become its custom , this gathering issued a declaration running more than 300 paragraphs , somewhat reduced from the 400 that emerged from the Havana summit in 1979 . It covers most of the political and economic issues of the day , now including cultural and communications matters . This massive document contrasts with the one issued by the annual seven- nation economic summit , typically about 30 paragraphs - and we ' ve even been promised there will be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s hardly believable . It wouldn ' t be surprising if many of the nonaligned leaders haven ' t read their manifesto from end to end . The tone of the ' 83 document contrasts with the one issued 3 1/2 years ago . That was much more trenchant , more uncompromising in its attacks on the world system and especially on the United States . One example will suffice : In 1979 , the summiteers " denounced the unacceptable policies and practices of transnational corporations which , motivated by exploitative profits , exhaust the resources , distort economies and infringe the sovereignty of developing countries ; violate the principle of noninterference in the affairs of state ; infringe the right of peoples to self-determination ; and frequently resort to bribery , corruption and other undesirable practices and subordinate the developing countries . . . . " By 1983 , the summiteers toned their remarks down to the expression of " grave concern with respect to transnational corporations which carry out illegal and undesirable policies and engage in corrupt practices in developing countries , and when their motivation to maximize profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In general , there was much more condemning , denouncing and deploring at Havana than New Delhi , where expressions of deep concern were the rule , though some deploring remained . The New Delhi declaration also makes some quite sensible proposals , which should be taken seriously . It ' s interesting to speculate on the reasons for the change . Is it mainly the present world depression and the resulting sense of economic desperation that led to the moderation of tone , or is it mainly due to India ' s constructive replacement of Cuba in the chair ? And if the latter , why do the nonaligned countries allow the chairman so much influence in the choice of their rhetoric ? The nonaligned countries use much of the language of Jefferson , Wilson and Roosevelt , especially on self-determination . Are they captured by the concepts of Western political thought , or is this merely a cynical calculation about how best to appeal to the West ? In any case , their application of these concepts is not fully consistent . They give repeated emphasis to noninterference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chile ( a nonmember ) on human rights and to urge Puerto Rican independence ( which the majority of Puerto Ricans has so far rejected ) and self- determination . Throughout the document there is a strong anti-American undertone . Despite their nonalignment , the nonaligned frequently criticize the United States by name , enjoining it to take this or that action , whereas the Soviet Union is hardly ever mentioned and indirect criticism is hedged . For example , the summiteers merely " viewed the situation in Afghanistan with particular concern " and reiterated their urgent call of two years ago for a political settlement and withdrawal of foreign troops . No doubt this temperance is explained in part by the fact that Afghanistan is a " nonaligned " country , as are Cuba , Angola , Vietnam and South Yemen , all of which provide facilities to Soviet military forces . Members offering facilities to US forces are Panama and soon Egypt . The nonaligned still thrive on anticolonial and anti-imperialist rhetoric , and for complex reasons the United States has come to be thought of as the leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticolonial history and the fact that the largest external empire - a state that has absorbed diverse peoples against their will - is the Soviet Union . Most of the remaining empires are in the Third World , doing what they can to discourage self- determination among their constituent peoples , which would lead to their fragmentation as states . Is the continued emphasis on US-led imperialism designed to distract attention from the situation at home ? The importance of these declarations should not be exaggerated . There is a certain amount of what has now become standard boilerplate . But it should not be dismissed . Many countries air their grievances , real and fancied , in sympathetic company with others . The declaration reflects and reinforces the intellectual frame of mind in much of the world , and US leaders should try to understand it , even if they can not always agree , and take advantage of the new pragmatism to cooperate with the nonaligned .
