txt THE LAST PICTURES Two days after his death there was a long article about him in Le Monde . Little by little , ' it wrote , Ernst Fischer has established himself as one of the most original and rewarding thinkers of " heretical " Marxism . ' He had influenced an entire generation of the left in Austria . During the last four years he was continually denounced in Eastern Europe for the significant influence he had had on the thinking of the Czechs who had created the Prague Spring . His books were translated into most languages . But the conditions of his life during the last five years were cramped and harsh . The Fischers had little money , were always subject to financial worries , and lived in a small , noisy workers ' flat in Vienna . Why not ? I hear his opponents ask . Was he better than the workers ? No , but he needed professional working conditions . In any case he himself did not complain . But with the unceasing noise of families and radios in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work as concentratedly in Vienna as he wished to do and was capable of doing . Hence the annual search for quiet , cheap places in the country ? where three months might represent so many chapters completed . The three sisters ' house was not available after August . We drove up a steep dust road through the forest . Once I asked a child the way in my terrible German and the child did not understand and simply stuffed her fist into her mouth in amazement . The others laughed at me . It was raining lightly : the trees were absolutely still . And I remember thinking as I drove round the hairpin bends that if I could define or realize the nature of the submission of the trees , I would learn something about the human body too ? at least about the human body when loved . The rain ran down the trees . A leaf is so easily moved . A breath of wind is sufficient . And yet not a leaf moved . We found the pension . The young woman and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long table where some other guests were already eating . The room was large with a bare wooden floor and big windows from which you looked over the shoulders of some nearby steep fields across the forest to the plain below . It was not unlike a canteen in a youth hostel , except that there were cushions // on the benches and flowers on the tables . The food was simple but good . After the meal we were to be shown the rooms . The husband came over with an architect 's plan in his hands . By next year everything will be different , ' he explained ; the owners want to make more money and so they 're going to convert the rooms and put bathrooms in and put up their prices . But this autumn you can still have the two rooms on the top floor as they are , and there 'll be nobody else up there , you 'll be quiet . ' We climbed to the rooms . They were identical , side by side , with the lavatory on the same landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed against the wall , a wash-basin and an austere cupboard , and at the end of it a window with a view of miles and miles of landscape . You can put a table in front of the window and work here . " Yes , yes , ' he said . You 'll finish the book . " Perhaps not all of it , but I could get much done . " You must take it , ' I said . I visualized him sitting at the table in front of the window , looking down at the still trees . The book was the second volume of his autobiography . It covered the period 1945 ? 55 ? when he had been very active in Austrian and international politics ? and it was to deal principally with the development and consequences of the Cold War which he saw , I think , as the counter-revolutionary reaction , on both sides of what was to become the Iron Curtain , to the popular victories of 1945 . I visualized his magnifying glass on the small table , his note-pad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed away when , stiffly but light on his feet , he had gone downstairs to take his regular walk before lunch . You must take it , ' I said again . We went for a walk together , the walk into the forest he would take each morning . I asked him why in the first volume of his memoirs he wrote in several distinctly different styles . Each style belongs to a different person . ' To a different aspect of yourself ? ' No , rather it belongs to a different self . ' Do these different selves coexist , or , when one is predominant , are the others absent ? ' // They are present together at the same time . None can disappear . The two strongest are my violent , hot , extremist , romantic self and the other my distant , sceptical self . ' Do they discourse together in your head ? ' No . ' ( He had a special way of saying No . As if he had long ago considered the question at length and after much patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , ' he continued . The sculptor Hrdlicka has done a head of me in marble . It makes me look much younger than I am . But you can see these two predominant selves in me ? each corresponding to a side of my face . One is perhaps a little like Danton , the other a little like Voltaire . ' As we walked along the forest path , I changed sides so as to examine his face , first from the right and then from the left . Each eye was different and was confirmed in its difference by the corner of the mouth on each side of his face . The right side was tender and wild . He had mentioned Danton . I thought rather of an animal : perhaps a kind of goat , light on its feet , a chamois maybe . The left side was sceptical but harsher : it made judgments but kept them to itself , it appealed to reason with an unswerving certainty . The left side would have been inflexible had it not been compelled to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my observations . And have their relative strengths always been the same ? ' I asked . The sceptical self has become stronger , ' he said . But there are other selves too . ' He smiled at me and took my arm and added , as though to reassure me : Its hegemony is not complete ! ' He said this a little breathlessly and in a slightly deeper voice than usual ? in the voice in which he spoke when moved , for example when embracing a person he loved . His walk was very characteristic . His hips moved stiffly , but otherwise he walked like a young man , quickly , lightly , to the rhythm of his own reflections . The present book , ' he said , is written in a consistent style ? detached , reasoning , cool . ' Because it comes later ? ' // No , because it is not really about myself . It is about an historical period . The first volume is also about myself and I could not have told the truth if I had written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self which was above the struggle of the others and could have told the story evenly . The categories we make between different aspects of experience ? so that , for instance , some people say I should not have spoken about love and about the Comintern in the same book ? these categories are mostly there for the convenience of liars . ' Does one self hide its decisions from the others ? ' Maybe he did n't hear the question . Maybe he wanted to say what he said whatever the question . My first decision , ' he said , was not to die . I decided when I was a child , in a sick-bed , with death at hand , that I wanted to live . ' From the pension we drove down to Graz . Lou and Anya needed to do some shopping ; Ernst and I installed ourselves in the lounge of an old hotel by the river . It was in this hotel that I had come to see Ernst on my way to Prague in the summer of ' 68 . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summarized for me the historical background to the new events taking place . Our interpretation of these events was not exactly the same , but it seems pointless now to try to define our small differences . Not because Ernst is dead , but because those events were buried alive and we see only their large contours heaped beneath the earth . Our specific points of difference no longer exist because the choices to which they applied no longer exist . Nor will they ever exist again in quite the same way . Opportunities can be irretrievably lost and then their loss is like a death . When the Russian tanks entered Prague in August 1968 Ernst was absolutely lucid about that death . In the lounge of the hotel I remembered the occasion of four years before . He had already been worried . Unlike many Czechs , he considered it quite likely that Brezhnev would order the Red Army to move in . But he still hoped . And this hope still carried within it all the other hopes which had been born in Prague that spring . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . But he remained incorrigibly orientated towards the future . His view of the past was for the benefit of the future ? for the benefit of the great or terrible transformations it held in store . But after ' 68 he recognized that the path towards any revolutionary transformation was bound to be long and tortuous and that Socialism in Europe would be deferred beyond his life-span . Hence the best use of his remaining time was to bear witness to the past . We did not talk about this in the hotel , for there was nothing new to decide . The important thing was to finish the second volume of his memoirs and that very morning we had found a way of making this happen more quickly . Instead , we talked of love : or , more exactly , about the state of being in love . Our talk followed roughly these lines . The capacity to fall in love is now thought of as natural and universal ? and as a passive capacity . ( Love strikes . Love-struck . ) Yet there have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exist . Being in love in fact depends upon the possibility of free active choice ? or anyway an apparent possibility . What does the lover choose ? He chooses to stake the world ( the whole of his life ) against the beloved . The beloved concentrates all the possibilities of the world within her and thus offers the realization of all his own potentialities . The beloved for the lover empties the world of hope ( the world that does not include her ) . Strictly speaking , being in love is a mood in so far as it is infinitely extensive ? it reaches beyond the stars ; but it can not develop without changing its nature , and so it can not endure . The equivalence between the beloved and the world is confirmed by sex . To make love with the beloved is , subjectively , to possess and be possessed by the world . Ideally , what remains outside the experience is ? nothing . Death of course is within it . This provokes the imagination to its very depths . One wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to make love with fish , with fruit , with hills , with forests , in the sea . And those , said Ernst , are the metamorphoses ! It is nearly always // that way round in Ovid . The beloved becomes a tree , a stream , a hill . Ovid 's Metamorphoses are not poetic conceits , they are really about the relation between the world and the poet in love . ' I looked into his eyes . They were pale . ( Invariably they were moist with the strain of seeing . ) They were pale like some blue flower bleached to a whitish grey by the sun . Yet despite their moisture and their paleness , the light which had bleached them was still reflected in them . The passion of my life , ' he said , was Lou . I had many love affairs . Some of them , when I was a student here in Graz , in this hotel . I was married . With all the other women I loved there was a debate , a discourse about our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our interests are the same . I do n't mean we never argue . She argued for Trotsky when I was still a Stalinist . But our interest ? below all our interests ? is singular . When I first met her , I said No . I remember the evening very well . I knew immediately I saw her , and I said No to myself . I knew that if I had a love affair with her , everything would stop . I would never love another woman . I would live monogamously . I thought I would not be able to work . We would do nothing except make love over and over again . The world would never be the same . She knew too . Before going home to Berlin she asked me very calmly : " Do you want me to stay ? " " No , " I said . ' Lou came back from the shops with some cheeses and yoghurts she had bought . Today we have talked for hours about me , ' said Ernst , you do n't talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the way out of Graz I stopped at a bookshop to find Ernst a copy of some poems by the Serbian poet Miodrag Pavlovic . Ernst had said sometime during the afternoon that he no longer wrote poems and no longer saw the purpose of poetry . It may be , ' he added , that my idea of poetry is outdated . ' I wanted him to read Pavlovic 's poems . I gave him the book in the car . I already have it , ' he said . But he put his hand on my shoulders . For the last time without suffering . // We were going to have supper in the cafe in the village . On the stairs outside his room , Ernst , who was behind me , suddenly but softly cried out . I turned round immediately . He had both his hands pressed to the small of his back . Sit down , ' I said , lie down . ' He took no notice . He was looking past me into the distance . His attention was there , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pain was bad . But it seemed to pass quite quickly . He descended the stairs ? no more slowly than usual . The three sisters were waiting at the front door to wish us good night . We stopped a moment to talk . Ernst explained that his rheumatism had jabbed him in the back . There was a curious distance about him . Either he consciously suspected what had happened , or else the chamois in him , the animal that was so strong in him , had already left to look for a secluded place in which to die . I question whether I am now using hindsight . I am not . He was already distant . We walked , chatting , through the garden past the sounds of water . Ernst opened the gate and fastened it because it was difficult , for the last time . We sat at our usual table in the public bar of the cafe . Some people were having their evening drink . They went out . The landlord , a man only interested in stalking and shooting deer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fetch our soup . Lou was furious and shouted after him . He did n't hear . She got up , went behind the bar and switched on the two lights again . I would have done the same , ' I said . Ernst smiled at Lou and then at Anya and me . If you and Lou lived together , ' he said , it would be explosive . ' When the next course came Ernst was unable to eat it . The landlord came up to enquire whether it was not good . It is excellently prepared , ' said Ernst , holding up the untouched plate of food in front of him , and excellently cooked , but I am afraid that I can not eat it . ' He looked pale and he said he had pains in the lower part of his stomach . Let us go back , ' I said . Again he appeared ? in response to the // suggestion ? to look into the distance . Not yet , ' he said , in a little while . ' We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he insisted on standing alone . On the way to the door he placed his hand on my shoulder ? as he had in the car . But it expressed something very different . And the touch of his hand was now even lighter . After we had driven a few hundred metres he said : I think I may be going to faint . ' I stopped and put my arm round him . His head fell on my shoulder . He was breathing in short gasps . With his left , sceptical eye he looked hard up into my face . A sceptical , questioning , unswerving look . Then his look became unseeing . The light which had bleached his eyes was no longer in them . He was breathing heavily . Anya flagged down a passing car and went back to the village to fetch help . She came back in another car . When she opened the door of our car , Ernst tried to move his feet out . It was his last instinctive movement ? to be ordered , willed , neat . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the gates , which were difficult , were already open so that we could drive up to the front door . The young man who had brought Anya from the village carried Ernst indoors and upstairs over his shoulders . I walked behind to stop his head banging against the door-jambs . We laid him down on his bed . We did helpless things to occupy ourselves whilst waiting for the doctor . But even waiting for the doctor was a pretext . There was nothing to do . We massaged his feet , we fetched a hot-water bottle , we felt his pulse . I stroked his cold head . His brown hands on the white sheet , curled up but not grasping , looked quite separate from the rest of the body . They appeared cut off by his cuffs . Like the forefeet cut off from an animal found dead in the forest . The doctor arrived . A man of fifty . Tired , pale-faced , sweating . He wore a peasant 's suit without a tie . He was like a veterinary surgeon . Hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this injection . ' He inserted the needle finely in the vein so that the liquid should flow along it like the water along the barrel-pipe in the garden . At this // moment we were alone in the room together . The doctor shook his head . How old is he ? " Seventy-three . " He looks older , ' he said . He looked younger when he was alive , ' I said . Has he had an infarctus before ? ' Yes . ' He has no chance this time , ' he said . Lou , Anya , the three sisters and I stood around his bed . He had gone . Besides painting scenes from everyday life on the walls of their tombs , the Etruscans carved on the lids of their sarcophagi fulllength figures representing the dead . Usually these figures are half-reclining , raised on one elbow , feet and legs relaxed as though on a couch , but head and neck alert as they gaze into the distance . Many thousands of such carvings were executed quickly and more or less according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these figures , their alertness as they look into the distance is striking . Given the context , the distance is surely a temporal rather than a spatial one : the distance is the future the dead projected when alive . They look into that distance as though they could stretch out a hand and touch it . I can make no sarcophagus carving . But there are pages written by Ernst Fischer where it seems to me that the writer wrote adopting an equivalent stance , achieving a similar quality of expectation . 1974 138 Francois , Georges and Amelie : a requiem in three parts Francois Francois was killed on a Saturday night . Just as it was getting dark . A car coming from behind knocked him over . The young driver of the car , who did n't stop , was fortunate because the autopsy showed that Francois was drunk . Even before the result of the autopsy , nobody in the village imagined anything different . If it was Saturday night and Francois was n't at the farm , he was on one of his weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was still attentive and careful about traffic . He was seventy-six . He owned what he was wearing , a few clothes he had left in the stable , a mouth-organ and the money which the police found tied into a plastic bag that he carried on a cord round his neck . Owning so little , what gave him pleasure ? The mountains , women , music and red wine . This makes him sound like a bohemian ? he who , even in his extravagant boasts and jokes , never left the valley of two adjacent rivers . Why have I put off for so long trying to describe and remember your funeral ? Because after it , you were not for once in the cafe telling a story about the late departed ? Because I 'm waiting for next summer when your absence will become more acute ? A knock on the door with your stick , and you walk in without waiting for an answer . Your creased face folded yet again into a smile . You give a long kiss to B. A smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next room ? as though it were beyond human ingenuity to invent a right that you would n't have in this mountain chalet where you once came to be congratulated on still being alive . There 's a man with the same name as me who has just died over there ! ' You pointed across the valley to the second river far below . There were those who thought it was me , me who was dead ! Me ! ' You opened your mouth and spread out your arms like a jack-inbox and roared with laughter . To those who are alive ! ' And we clinked our glasses together . Do you remember ? There were only a few people at the funeral , because nobody thought of putting a notice in the local paper and Francois was buried , not in the village , but in the small town where he was killed . Nobody knows what happened to the money he carried round his neck . It amounted to several hundred pounds . When he was at the farm , he hid it . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wo n't touch it , I have my own . He worked in exchange for his keep , not for wages , and in this way he kept his independence . He worked when he liked , he left when he liked . If there were any remaining members of his family left , none of them appeared . Small towns now have an exclusive deal with some undertaking firm . It 's arranged by the mayor . In exchange for this exclusivity , the firm agrees to supply one free funeral a year . In the case of a pauper , this saves the community money . The firm in question gave a free funeral to Francois , which did n't include flowers . He had looked after animals all his life , either in the valley or on the mountain . He was used to their company . Of the company of men ? not women ? he was more suspicious . They did n't all necessarily accept the authority he took upon himself . I 've had enough of his cows eating my grass ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not even your grass ! ' said a young man standing at the counter . If I see him , I 'll punch his face in ! ' // You 're too old to punch anything in ! ' And at your age , you know nothing . Nothing . I 've been a shepherd for fifty years ! ' The little group followed the coffin down the street towards the cemetery . As they passed the steamed-up windows of a cafe , six men came out to join the procession . They left their glasses half-full on the counter for they would soon be back . When he was young he enjoyed dancing ; later he liked to make people dance . And so whenever he heard of a celebration taking place and he was able to go , he took his mouth-organ . One Saturday night at a friend 's birthday party he lost it . I was there when his boss 's wife gave him another to replace the one he had lost . The three of us were sitting outside the chalet . The water was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our feet . Some parachutists had just jumped off the mountain and were drifting down to the valley . He took the mouth-organ out of its box . He examined it on every side to ensure that it included no secret which he did n't already know . He tried holding it in his hands , as he would when playing , but without raising it to his lips . Then he put it back into its box and slipped the box into his pocket . It was no longer a present , it was his . The small group of us filed past the coffin . His , just as his completed life had now become his . Georges Georges was killed on a Monday when working by the bridge over the Foron . It was in the afternoon . Young Bernard came into the stable with the news at milking time the same evening . The vet was there looking at the calf who had had something wrong with its stomach since birth . He 's dead ! ' cried out Claire in protest . Then she addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them might contradict her . Jeanne , he 's dead ! Theophile , he 's dead ! Monsieur , he 's dead ! ' // Jeanne said nothing but she clenched her jaw , and her eyes were filled with tears . The three men stood in silence without moving , the vet holding the syringe in his hand against his own arm . He was carried down the river before anybody could reach him and drowned . Bernard , who had never before been the bearer of such bad news , walked solemnly out of the stable . Then , a little later , after the vet had left , the words came . Where is the justice ? ' His arm was sticking out from the rocks , that 's how they found him . ' It takes away even your will to work . ' There were three of them unblocking a drain , and then the water broke through without any warning . ' Without any warning . ' Georges was twenty-eight . He had been married three years before . The couple did n't yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the rocks against which the river had flung him . All over he was grazed and cut . But the bruises , which would have appeared , did n't come , because he was dead . His body was taken home to his wife with a bandage round his head to hide the worst wounds . He was laid out on his large bed , and friends and relatives came to pay him their last respects . Each night Martine , his wife , lay beside him . He must have been outside the blankets , ' she announced the first morning , for I could feel that he was a little cold . ' On the third day when it was time to place him in his coffin , she said : Now it is time to close it , his poor corpse is beginning to smell . ' During those three days , his death haunted the village too . It was an unnatural death which had come as brutally and unexpectedly as the mass of water which engulfed him . All the rivers and streams around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the sound of the water which killed him . He was too young , // he carried too many hopes away with him . A thousand people came to the funeral on Thursday . When the coffin came out of the church , Martine was supported on either side by two of his brothers . They carried her , for her legs trailed behind her , and following the coffin , she wailed : Jo Jo , no ! Jo Jo , no ! ' Georges , whom everyone knew as Jo-Jo , could not reply . A thousand men and women stood in silence and witnessed the chief mourner 's fight , her heaving fight , not for breath but to be able to stop breathing . Above the cemetery the orchards were littered with broken branches torn from the apple trees by the snow which , melting now , swelled the rivers . During the next two weeks Martine hoped against hope that she might have conceived just before Georges 's death . And then again the blood came . Amelie Amelie never saw a doctor in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to be too late . She was eighty-two ; she had congestion on both lungs and her heart gave up . She lived with her son who was already a widower . This son had been born when his mother was seventeen . She had not been able to marry the boy 's father , because he , the father , was only thirteen . Everyone knew the story of Amelie 's life . She was a woman of great endurance . She worked every day on the farm with her son until she was taken ill for the first and last time . She was , it was often said , a force of nature . Fifteen years after the birth of her son , she became pregnant again . Still unmarried , she was living with her mother . This was at the time of the Popular Front , Franco 's victory in Spain , the approaching holocaust . Her mother was old and her eyes were failing . And so , on this second occasion , Amelie decided to spare her mother 's feelings ? // or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her mother 's nagging and execration ? In any case , she kept her pregnancy a secret . She was already a large woman , and she bound her belly tightly so that its rising was not very pronounced . On the evening when her labour began , she climbed up into the barn and there , during the night , delivered her own baby , alone . The baby was a girl , and this daughter , now a middle-aged woman , was standing against the cemetery wall whilst neighbours and friends came and offered their condolences for her mother 's death . On Amelie 's coffin , in the middle of the cemetery , there was a wreath , the size of a counterpane , of red and pink carnations . The colours of blood and youth . Before dawn , fifty years ago , Amelie took the train to the nearest town and there left her newborn daughter at the house of a woman with whom she had already come to an arrangement . The same evening she was back home , working in the stable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . Amelie 's mother never knew that she had a grand-daughter , but there were neighbours who had been aware of Amelie 's condition and who now whispered that she had murdered her child . The police from the town made an official investigation . They came to cross-question Amelie , who laughed in the inspector 's face . What I 've done is no crime , she said . You can accuse me of nothing , except ? here she shut her eyes ? of being too good-natured ! As soon as her mother died , Amelie brought her daughter back home . And when her village schooling was over , she sent her daughter to a secondary school , so that she would not be condemned to being a peasant , if , by chance , she had the opportunity of choosing . This daughter did not take up the choice ; she married locally and had two children . One of these children , now a young woman of seventeen , was at the funeral . Six months earlier she had given birth to a baby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a pastrycook ? and she had not pursued him to insist that he should marry her . She stood there now , her long hair loose on her shoulders , // looking boldly and solemnly at those who had come to bury her grandmother . At most funerals in the village there are at least 200 mourners . And Amelie 's was no exception . They came because they respected her , because the last service they could offer her was to pray for her , because their absence might be noticed , because when , for each of them , their turn came to join the population of the village dead beneath the ground , a population which , counted over the centuries , was now that of a small city , each hoped to benefit from the same gesture of solidarity . Yet this afternoon the funeral was ending differently . The priest was as usual blessing the family grave into which later the coffin would be lowered . But in the cypress tree a bird was singing . Nobody knew what kind of bird it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest 's prayers and the amens of the two choirboys were quite inaudible . The entire cemetery was filled with the thrills and warbling of this song . And there was scarcely a woman or man standing in the February sunlight , their arms folded , or their large hands clasped behind the back , who did not think : throughout the years , across the generations , a force drives on , like the sap now rising , and it is implacable and destructive and reproductive ; it makes mouths open , eyes burn , hands join . ( They were gazing as much at the grand-daughter as at the coffin with its red and pink flowers . ) And this force condemns to work and to sacrifice , also it kills , and it sings , even at this moment is singing , and will never stop . 198o 145 Drawn to that moment When my father died recently , I did several drawings of him in his coffin . Drawings of his face and head . There is a story about Kokoschka teaching a life class . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and instructed him to pretend to collapse . When he had fallen over , Kokoschka rushed over to him , listened to his heart and announced to the shocked students that he was dead . A little afterwards the model got to his feet and resumed the pose . Now draw him , ' said Kokoschka , as though you were aware that he was alive and not dead ! ' One can imagine that the students , after this theatrical experience , drew with more verve . Yet to draw the truly dead involves an ever greater sense of urgency . What you are drawing will never be seen again , by you or by anybody else . In the whole course of time past and time to come , this moment is unique : the last opportunity to draw what will never again be visible , which has occurred once and which will never reoccur . Because the faculty of sight is continuous , because visual categories ( red , yellow , dark , thick , thin ) remain constant , and because so many things appear to remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always the result of an unrepeatable , momentary encounter . Appearances , at any given moment , are a construction emerging from the debris of everything which has previously appeared . It is something like this that I understand in those words of Cezanne which so often come back to me : One minute in the life of the world is going by . Paint it as it is . ' Beside my father 's coffin I summoned such skill as I have as a draughtsman , to apply it directly to the task in hand . I say directly X46 DRAWN TO THAT MOMENT because often skill in drawing expresses itself as a manner , and then its application to what is being drawn is indirect . Mannerism ? in the general rather than art-historical sense ? comes from the need to invent urgency , to produce an urgent ' drawing , instead of submitting to the urgency of what is . Here I was using my small skill to save a likeness , as a lifesaver uses his much greater skill as a swimmer to save a life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensity of seeing for the first time , but the intensity of seeing for the last time is , I believe , greater . Of all that I could see only the drawing would remain . I was the last ever to look on the face I was drawing . I wept whilst I strove to draw with complete objectivity . As I drew his mouth , his brows , his eyelids , as their specific forms emerged with lines from the whiteness of the paper , I felt the history and the experience which had made them as they were . His life was now as finite as the rectangle of paper on which I was drawing , but within it , in a way infinitely more mysterious than any drawing , his character and destiny had emerged . I was making a record and his face was already only a record of his life . Each drawing then was nothing but the site of a departure . They remained . I looked at them and found that they resembled my father . Or , more strictly , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever mistake these drawings as ones of an old man sleeping . Why not ? I ask myself . And the answer , I think , is in the way they are drawn . Nobody would draw a sleeping man with such objectivity . About this quality there is finality . Objectivity is what is left when something is finished . I chose one drawing to frame and hang on the wall in front of the table at which I work . Gradually and consistently the relationship of his drawing to my father changed ? or changed for me . There are several ways of describing the change . The content of the drawing increased . The drawing , instead of marking the site of a departure , began to mark the site of an arrival . The forms , drawn , filled out . The drawing became the immediate locus of my memories of my father . The drawing was no longer deserted but inhabited . For // each form , between the pencil marks and the white paper they marked , there an object of perception , with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked like a filter : from behind , it drew out my memories of the past whilst , forwards , it projected an image which , unchanging , was becoming increasingly familiar . My father came back to give the image of his death mask a kind of life . If I look at the drawing now I scarcely see the face of a dead man ; instead I see aspects of my father 's life . Yet if somebody from the village came in , he would see only a drawing of a death mask . It is still unmistakably that . The change which has taken place is subjective . Yet , in a more general sense , if such a subjective process did not exist , neither would drawings . The advent of the cinema and television means that we now define drawings ( or paintings ) as static images . What we often overlook is that their virtue , their very function , depended upon this . The need to discover the camera , and the instantaneous or moving image , arose for many different reasons but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image , or , if it was presented in those terms , it was only because the meaning of the static image had been lost . In the nineteenth century when social time became unilinear , vectorial and regularly exchangeable , the instant became the maximum which could be grasped or preserved . The plate camera and the pocket watch , the reflex camera and the wrist-watch , are twin inventions . A drawing or painting presupposes another view of time . Any image ? like the image read from the retina ? records an appearance which will disappear . The faculty of sight developed as an active response to continually changing contingencies . The more it developed , the more complex the set of appearances it could construct from events . ( An event in itself has no appearances . ) Recognition is an essential part of this construction . And recognition depends upon the phenomenon of reappearance sometimes occurring in the ceaseless flux of disappearance . Thus , if appearances , at // any given moment , are a construction emerging from the debris of all that has previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give birth to the idea that everything will one day be recognizable , and the flux of disappearance cease . Such an idea is more than a personal dream ; it has supplied the energy for a large part of human culture . For example : the story triumphs over oblivion ; music offers a centre ; the drawing challenges disappearance . What is the nature of this challenge ? A fossil also challenges ' disappearance but the challenge is meaningless . A photograph challenges disappearance but its challenge is different from that of the fossil or the drawing . The fossil is the result of random chance . The photographed image has been selected for preservation . The drawn image contains the experience of looking . A photograph is evidence of an encounter between event and photographer . A drawing slowly questions an event 's appearance and in doing so reminds us that appearances are always a construction with a history . ( Our aspiration towards objectivity can only proceed from the admission of subjectivity . ) We use photographs by taking them with us , in our lives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move them . Whereas a drawing or painting forces us to stop and enter its time . A photograph is static because it has stopped time . A drawing or painting is static because it encompasses time . I should perhaps explain here why I make a certain distinction between drawings and paintings . Drawings reveal the process of their own making , their own looking , more clearly . The imitative facility of a painting often acts as a disguise ? i.e. what it refers to becomes more impressive than the reason for referring to it . Great paintings are not disguised in this way . But even a third-rate drawing reveals the process of its own creation . How does a drawing or painting encompass time ? What does it hold in its stillness ? A drawing is more than a memento ? a device for bringing back memories of time past . The space ' that my drawing offers for my father 's return into it is quite distinct from that offered // by a letter from him , an object owned by him or , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And here it is incidental that I am looking at a drawing which I drew myself . An equivalent drawing by anybody else would offer the same space ' . To draw is to look , examining the structure of appearances . A drawing of a tree shows , not a tree , but a tree-being-looked-at . Whereas the sight of a tree is registered almost instantaneously , the examination of the sight of a tree ( a tree-being-looked-at ) not only takes minutes or hours instead of a fraction of a second , it also involves , derives from , and refers back to , much previous experience of looking . Within the instant of the sight of a tree is established a life-experience . This is how the act of drawing refuses the process of disappearances and proposes the simultaneity of a multitude of moments . From each glance a drawing assembles a little evidence , but it consists of the evidence of many glances which can be seen together . On one hand , there is no sight in nature as unchanging as that of a drawing or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a drawing consists of so many assembled moments that they constitute a totality rather than a fragment . The static image of a drawing or painting is the result of the opposition of two dynamic processes . Disappearances opposed by assemblage . If , for diagrammatic convenience , one accepts the metaphor of time as a flow , a river , then the act of drawing , by driving upstream , achieves the stationary . Vermeer 's view of Delft across the canal displays this as no theoretical explanation ever can . The painted moment has remained ( almost ) unchanged for three centuries . The reflections in the water have not moved . Yet this painted moment , as we look at it , has a plenitude and actuality that we experience only rarely in life . We experience everything we see in the painting as absolutely momentary . At the same time the experience is repeatable the next day or in ten years . It would be naive to suppose that this has to do with accuracy : Delft at any given moment never looked like this painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square millimetre ofVermeer 's looking , with the density per square millimetre of assembled moments . As a drawing , the drawing above my table is unremarkable . But it works in accord with the same hopes and principles which have led me to draw for thousands of years . It works because from being a site of departure , it has become a site of arrival . Every day more of my father 's life returns to the drawing in front of me. 1976 151 The unsaid On my table a pile of letters not yet replied to the earliest dated three years before .

It is true that I would not expect them to have been painted today . They are both too optimistic and too revolutionary for that . Perhaps in a way I am surprised that they have been painted at all . It would seem more likely that they were yet to be painted . Do I make things unnecessarily complicated ? Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few great Cubist works were painted // between 1907 and 1914 ? And perhaps to qualify this by adding that a few more , by Juan Gris , were painted a little later ? And anyway is it not nonsense to think of Cubism having not yet taken place when we are surrounded in daily life by the apparent effects of Cubism ? All modern design , architecture and town planning seems inconceivable without the initial example of Cubism . Nevertheless I must insist on the sensation I have in front of the works themselves : the sensation that the works and I , as I look at them , are caught , pinned down , in an enclave of time , waiting to be released and to continue a journey that began in 1907 . Cubism was a style of painting which evolved very quickly , and whose various stages can be fairly specifically defined ) Yet there were also Cubist poets , Cubist sculptors , and later on so-called Cubist designers and architects . Certain original stylistic features of Cubism can be found in the pioneer works of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the de Stijl movement . The question thus arises : can Cubism be adequately defined as a style ? It seems unlikely . Nor can it be defined as a policy . There was never any Cubist manifesto . The opinions and outlook of Picasso , Braque , Leger or Juan Gris were clearly very different even during the few years when their paintings had many features in common . Is it not enough that the category of Cubism includes those works that are now generally agreed to be within it ? This is enough for dealers , collectors , and cataloguers who go by the name of art historians . But it is not , I believe , enough for you or me . Even those whom the stylistic category satisfies are wont to say that Cubism constituted a revolutionary change in the history of art . Later we shall analyse this change in detail . The concept of painting as it had existed since the Renaissance was overthrown . The idea of art holding up a mirror to nature became a nostalgic one : a means of diminishing instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used seriously and not merely as an 16o THE MOMENT OF CUBISM epithet for this season 's novelties , it implies a process . No revolution is simply the result of personal originality . The maximum that such originality can achieve is madness : madness is revolutionary freedom confined to the self . Cubism can not be explained in terms of the genius of its exponents . And this is emphasized by the fact that most of them became less profound artists when they ceased to be Cubists . Even Braque and Picasso never surpassed the works of their Cubist period : and a great deal of their later work was inferior . The story of how Cubism happened in terms of painting and of the leading protagonists has been told many times . The protagonists themselves found it extremely difficult ? both at the time and afterwards ? to explain the meaning of what they were doing . To the Cubists , Cubism was spontaneous . To us it is part of history . But a curiously unfinished part . Cubism should be considered not as a stylistic category but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or seven years ) experienced by a certain number of people . A strangely placed moment . It was a moment in which the promises of the future were more substantial than the present . With the important exception of the avant-garde artists during a few years after 1917 in Moscow , the confidence of the Cubists has never since been equalled among artists . D. H. Kahnweiler , who was a friend of the Cubists and their dealer , has written : I lived those seven crucial years from 1907 to 1914 with my painter friends ... what occurred at that time in the plastic arts will be understood only if one bears in mind that a new epoch was being born , in which man ( all mankind in fact ) was undergoing a transformation more radical than any other known within historical times.2 What was the nature of this transformation ? I have outlined elsewhere ( in The Success and Failure of Picasso ) the relation between Cubism and the economic , technological and scientific develop- // ments of the period . There seems little point in repeating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to push a little further our definition of the philosophic meaning of these developments and their coincidence . An interlocking world system of imperialism ; opposed to it , a socialist international ; the founding of modern physics , physiology and sociology ; the increasing use of electricity , the invention of radio and the cinema ; the beginnings of mass production ; the publishing of mass-circulation newspapers ; the new structural possibilities offered by the availability of steel and aluminium ; the rapid development of chemical industries and the production of synthetic materials ; the appearance of the motor-car and the aeroplane : what did all this mean ? The question may seem so vast that it leads to despair . Yet there are rare historical moments to which such a question can perhaps be applied . These are moments of convergence , when numerous developments enter a period of similar qualitative change , before diverging into a multiplicity of new terms . Few of those who live through such a moment can grasp the full significance of the qualitative change taking place ; but everybody is aware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appears to advance towards them . This was surely the case in Europe from about i 900 to 1914 ? although one must remember , when studying the evidence , that the reaction of many people to their own awareness of change is to pretend to ignore it . Apollinaire , who was the greatest and most representative poet of the Cubist movement , repeatedly refers to the future in his poetry . Where my youth fell You see the flame of the future You must know that I speak today To tell the whole world That the art of prophecy is born at last . The developments which converged at the beginning of the twentieth century in Europe changed the meaning of both time and // space . All , in different ways , some inhuman and others full of promise , offered a liberation from the immediate , from the rigid distinction between absence and presence . The concept of the field , first put forward by Faraday when wrestling with the problem ? as defined in traditional terms ? of action at a distance ' , entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculation and even into many modes of feeling . There was a startling extension through time and space of human power and knowledge . For the first time the world , as a totality , ceased to be an abstraction and became realizable . If Apollinaire was the greatest Cubist poet , Blaise Cendrars was the first . His poem , Les Paques a New York ' ( 1912 ) had a profound influence on Apollinaire and demonstrated to him how radically one could break with tradition . The three major poems of Cendrars at this time were all concerned with travelling ? but travelling in a new sense across a realizable globe . In Le Panama ou Les Aventures de Mes Sept Oncles ' he writes : Poetry dates from today The milky way round my neck The two hemispheres on my eyes At full speed There are no more breakdowns If I had the time to save a little money I 'd be flying in the air show I have reserved my seat in the first train through the tunnel under the Channel I am the first pilot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refers to the then estimated population of the world . It is important to see how philosophically far-reaching were the consequences of this change and why it can be termed qualitative . It was not merely a question of faster transport , quicker messages , a more complex scientific vocabulary , larger accumulations of capital , wider markets , international organizations , etc . The process of the // secularization of the world was at last complete . Arguments against the existence of God had achieved little . But now man was able to extend himself indefinitely beyond the immediate : he took over the territory in space and time where God had been presumed to exist . Zone ' , the poem that Apollinaire wrote under the immediate influence of Cendrars , contains the following lines : Christ pupil of the eye Twentieth pupil of the centuries knows how This century changed into a bird ascends like Jesus Devils in pits raise their heads to watch it They say it 's imitating Simon Magus ofJudea If it can fly , we 'll call it the fly one Angels swing past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first aeroplane Dispersing at times to let through the priests As they bear the Holy Eucharist Forever ascending and raising the Host ... 3 The second consequence concerned the relation of the self to the secularized world . There was no longer any essential discontinuity between the individual and the general . The invisible and the multiple no longer intervened between each individual and the world . It was becoming more and more difficult to think in terms of having been placed in the world . A man was part of the world and indivisible from it . In an entirely original sense , which remains at the basis of modern consciousness , a man was the world which he inherited . Again , Apollinaire expresses this : I have known since then the bouquet of the world I am drunk from having drunk the universe whole . All the previous spiritual problems of religion and morality would now be increasingly concentrated in a man 's choice of attitude to the existing state of the world considered as his own existing state . It is now only against the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure his stature . He is enhanced or diminished according to how he acts towards the enhancement or diminishment of the world . His self apart from the world , his self wrenched from its global context ? the sum of all existing social contexts ? is a mere biological accident . The secularization of the world exacts its price as well as offering the privilege of a choice , clearer than any other in history . Apollinaire : I am everywhere or rather I start to be everywhere It is I who am starting this thing of the centuries to come . As soon as more than one man says this , or feels it , or aspires towards feeling it ? and one must remember that the notion and the feeling are the consequence of numerous material developments impinging upon millions of lives ? as soon as this happens , the unity of the world has been proposed . The term unity of the world ' can acquire a dangerously utopian aura . But only if it is thought to be politically applicable to the world as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is the end of exploitation . The evasion of this fact is what renders the term utopian . Meanwhile the term has other significations . In many respects ( the Declaration of Human Rights , military strategy , communications , etc. ) the world since 1900 has been treated as a single unit . The unity of the world has received de facto recognition . Today we know that the world should be unified , just as we know that all men should have equal rights . Insofar as a man denies this or acquiesces in its denial , he denies the unity of his own self . Hence the profound psychological sickness of the imperialist countries , hence the corruption implicit in so much of their learning ? when knowledge is used to deny knowledge . At the moment of Cubism , no denials were necessary . It was a moment of prophecy , but prophecy as the basis of a transformation that had actually begun . // Apollinaire : Already I hear the shrill sound of the friend 's voice to come Who walks with you in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suggest a general period of ebullient optimism . It was a period of poverty , exploitation , fear and desperation . The majority could only be concerned with the means of their survival , and millions did not survive . But for those who asked questions , there were new positive answers whose authenticity seemed to be guaranteed by the existence of new forces . The socialist movements in Europe ( with the exception of that in Germany and sections of the trade-union movement in the United States ) were convinced that they were on the eve of revolution and that the revolution would spread to become a world revolution . This belief was shared even by those who disagreed about the political means necessary ? by syndicalists , parliamentarians , communists and anarchists . A particular kind of suffering was coming to an end : the suffering of hopelessness and defeat . People now believed , if not for themselves then for the future , in victory . The belief was often strongest where the conditions were worst . Everyone who was exploited or downtrodden and who had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life was able to hear in answer the echo of declarations like that of Lucheni , the Italian anarchist who stabbed the Empress of Austria in 1898 : The hour is not far distant when a new sun will shine upon all men alike ' ; or like that of Kalyaev in 1905 who , on being sentenced to death for the assassination of the GovernorGeneral of Moscow , told the court to learn to look the advancing revolution straight in the eye ' . An end was in sight . The limitless , which until now had always reminded men of the unattainability of their hopes , became suddenly an encouragement . The world became a starting point . The small circle of Cubist painters and writers were not directly // involved in politics . They did not think in political terms . Yet they were concerned with a revolutionary transformation of the world . How was this possible ? Again we find the answer in the historical timing of the Cubist movement . It was not then essential for a man 's intellectual integrity to make a political choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalent qualitative change , appeared to promise a transformed world . The promise was an overall one . All is possible , ' wrote Andre Salmon , another Cubist poet , ' everything is realizable everywhere and with everything . ' Imperialism had begun the process of unifying the world . Mass production promised eventually a world of plenty . Mass-circulation newspapers promised informed democracy . The aeroplane promised to make the dream of Icarus real . The terrible contradictions born of the convergence were not yet clear . They became evident in 1914 and they were first politically polarized by the Russian Revolution of 1917 . El Lissitzky , one of the great innovators of Russian revolutionary art until this art was suppressed , implies in a biographical note how the moment of political choice came from the conditions of the Cubist moment : The Film of El 's Life till 19264 BIRTH : My generation was born a few dozen years before the Great October Revolution . ANCESTORS : A few centuries ago our ancestors had the luck to make the great voyages of discovery . WE : We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most glorious inventions .

Barely five years old I had the rubber leads of Edison 's phonograph stuck in my ears . 16 ' 7 THE WORK OF ART Eight years , and I was chasing after the first electric tram in Smolensk , the diabolical force which drove the peasant horses out of the town . COMPRESSION OF MATTER : The steam engine rocked my cradle . In the meantime it has gone the way of all ichthyosauruses . Machines are ceasing to have fat bellies full of intestines . Already we have the compressed skulls of dynamos with their electric brains . Matter and mind are directly transmitted through crankshafts and thus made to work . Gravity and inertia are being overcome . 1918 : In 1918 in Moscow before my eyes the short-circuit sparked which split the world in half . This stroke drove our present apart like a wedge between yesterday and tomorrow . My work too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belongs here or there : there is no middle . The Cubist movement ended in France in 1914 . With the war a new kind of suffering was born . Men were forced to face for the first time the full horror ? not of hell , or damnation , or a lost battle , or famine , or plague ? but the full horror of what stood in the way of their own progress . And they were forced to face this in terms of their own responsibility , not in terms of a simple confrontation as between clearly defined enemies . The scale of the waste and the irrationality and the degree to which men could be persuaded and forced to deny their own interests led to // the belief that there were incomprehensible and blind forces at work . But since these forces could no longer be accommodated by religion , and since there was no ritual by which they could be approached or appeased , each man had to live with them within himself , as best he could . Within him they destroyed his will and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Front the hero thinks : I am very quiet . Let the months and years come , they can take nothing from me , they can take nothing more . I am so alone , and so without hope that I can confront them without fear . The life that has borne me through these years is still in my hands and my eyes . Whether I have subdued it , I know not . But so long as it is there it will seek its own way out , heedless of the will that is within s The new kind of suffering which was born in 1914 and has persisted in Western Europe until the present day is an inverted suffering . Men fought within themselves about the meaning of events , identity , hope . This was the negative possibility implicit in the new relation of the self to the world . The life they experienced became a chaos within them . They became lost within themselves . Instead of apprehending ( in however simple and direct a way ) the processes which were rendering their own destinies identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition passively . That is to say the world , which was nevertheless indivisibly part of them , reverted in their minds to being the old world which was separate from them and opposed them : it was as though they had been forced to devour God , heaven and hell and live for ever with the fragments inside themselves . It was indeed a new and terrible form of suffering and it coincided with the widespread , deliberate use of false ideological propaganda as a weapon . Such propaganda preserves within people outdated structures of feeling and thinking whilst forcing new experiences upon them . It transforms them into puppets ? whilst most of the strain brought about by the transformation remains politically harmless as inevitably incoherent frustration . The only purpose of such propaganda is to make people deny and then me. // abandon the selves which otherwise their own experience would create . In La Jolie Rousse ' , Apollinaire 's last long poem ( he died in 1918 ) , his vision of the future , after his experience of the war , has become a source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reconcile what he has seen with what he once foresaw ? From now on there can be no unpolitical prophecies . We are not your enemies We want to take over vast strange territories Where the flowering mystery waits to be picked Where there are fires and colours never yet seen A thousand imponderable apparitions Which must be given reality We wish to explore the vast domain of goodness where everything is silent And time can be pursued or brought back Pity us who fight continually on the frontiers Of the infinite and the future Pity for our mistakes pity for our sins . The violence of summer is here My youth like the spring is dead Now , 0 sun , is the time of scorching Reason Laugh then laugh at me Men from everywhere and more particularly here For there are so many things I dare not tell you So many things you will not let me say Have pity on me . We can now begin to understand the central paradox of Cubism . The spirit of Cubism was objective . Hence its calm and its comparative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its technical prophecies . I live in a satellite city that has been built during the last five years . The character of the pattern of what I now see out of the window as I write can be traced directly back to the Cubist pictures of 1911 and 1912 . Yet the Cubist spirit seems to us today to be curiously distant and disengaged . // This is because the Cubists took no account of politics as we have since experienced them . In common with even their experienced political contemporaries , they did not imagine and did not foresee the extent , depth and duration of the suffering which would be involved in the political struggle to realize what had so clearly become possible and what has since become imperative . The Cubists imagined the world transformed , but not the process of transformation . Cubism changed the nature of the relationship between the painted image and reality , and by so doing it expressed a new relationship between man and reality . Many writers have pointed out that Cubism marked a break in the history of art comparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is not to say that Cubism can be equated with the Renaissance . The confidence of the Renaissance lasted for about sixty years ( approximately from 1420 to 1480 ) : that of Cubism lasted for about six years . However , the Renaissance remains a point of departure for appreciating Cubism . In the early Renaissance the aim of art was to imitate nature . Alberti formulated this view : The function of the painter is to render with lines and colours , on a given panel or wall , the visible surface of any body , so that at a certain distance and from a certain position it appears in relief and just like the body itself.i6 It was not , of course , as simple as that . There were the mathematical problems of linear perspective which Alberti himself solved . There was the question of choice ? that is to say the question of the artist doing justice to nature by choosing to represent what was typical of nature at her best . Yet the artist 's relation to nature was comparable to that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason and method to the study of the world . He observed and ordered his findings . The parallelism of the two disciplines is later demonstrated by the example of Leonardo . // Although often employed far less accurately during the following centuries , the metaphorical model for the function of painting at this time was the mirror . Alberti cites Narcissus when he sees himself reflected in the water as the first painter . The mirror renders the appearances of nature and simultaneously delivers them into the hands of man . It is extremely hard to reconstruct the attitudes of the past . In the light of more recent developments and the questions raised by them , we tend to iron out the ambiguities which may have existed before the questions were formed . In the early Renaissance , for example , the humanist view and a medieval Christian view could still be easily combined . Man became the equal of God , but both retained their traditional positions . Arnold Hauser writes of the early Renaissance : The seat of God was the centre round which the heavenly spheres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe , and man himself a self-contained microcosm round which , as it were , revolved the whole of nature , just as the celestial bodies revolved round that fixed star , the earth . ' ? Thus man could observe nature around him on every side and be enhanced both by what he observed and by his own ability to observe . He had no need to consider that he was essentially part of that nature . Man was the eye for which reality had been made visual : the ideal eye , the eye of the viewing point of Renaissance perspective . The human greatness of his eye lay in its ability to reflect and contain , like a mirror , what was . The Copernican revolution , Protestantism , the CounterReformation destroyed the Renaissance position . With this destruction modern subjectivity was born . The artist becomes primarily concerned with creation . His own genius takes the place of nature as the marvel . It is the gift of his genius , his spirit ' , his grace ' which makes him god-like . At the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mystery enters art to emphasize the inequality . A century after Alberti 's claim that art and science are parallel activities , Michelangelo speaks ? no longer of imitating I72 THE MOMENT OF CUBISM nature ? but of imitating Christ : In order to imitate in some degree the venerable image of Our Lord , it is not enough to be a painter , a great and skilful master ; I believe that one must further be of blameless life , even if possible a saint , that the Holy Spirit may inspire one 's understanding . ' 8 It would take us too far from our field even to attempt to trace the history of art from Michelangelo onwards ? Mannerism , the Baroque , seventeenth- and eighteenth-century classicism . What is relevant to our purpose is that , from Michelangelo until the French Revolution , the metaphorical model for the function of painting becomes the theatre stage . It may seem unlikely that the same model works for a visionary like El Greco , a Stoic like Poussin ( who actually worked from stage models he built himself ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists of these two centuries shared certain assumptions . For them all the power of art lay in its artciality . That is to say they were concerned with constructing comprehensive examples of some truth such as could not be met with in such an ecstatic , pointed , sublime or meaningful way in life itself . Painting became a schematic art . The painter 's task was no longer to represent or imitate what existed : it was to summarize experience . Nature is now what man has to redeem himself from . The artist becomes responsible not simply for the means of conveying a truth , but also for the truth itself . Painting ceases to be a branch of natural science and becomes a branch of the moral sciences . In the theatre the spectator faces events from whose consequences he is immune ; he may be affected emotionally and morally but he is physically removed , protected , separate , from what is happening before his eyes . What is happening is artificial . It is he who now represents nature ? not the work of art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is from himself that he must redeem himself , this represents the contradiction of the Cartesian division which prophetically or actually so dominated these two centuries . Rousseau , Kant and the French Revolution ? or rather , all the developments which lay behind the thought of the philosophers and // the actions of the Revolution ? made it impossible to go on believing in constructed order as against natural chaos . The metaphorical model changed again , and once more it applies over a long period despite dramatic changes of style . The new model is that of the personal account . Nature no longer confirms or enhances the artist as he investigates it . Nor is he any longer concerned with creating artificial ' examples , for these depend upon the common recognition of certain moral values . He is now alone , surrounded by nature , from which his own experience separates him . Nature is what he sees through his experience . There is thus in all nineteenth-century art ? from the pathetic fallacy ' of the Romantics to the optics ' of the Impressionists ? considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins . The artist 's personal account is his attempt to make his experience as real as nature , which he can never reach , by communicating it to others . The considerable suffering of most nineteenth-century artists arose out of this contradiction : because they were alienated from nature , they needed to present themselves as nature to others . Speech , as the recounting of experience and the means of making it real , preoccupied the Romantics . Hence their constant comparisons between paintings and poetry . Gericault , whose Raft of the Medusa ' was the first painting of a contemporary event consciously based on eyewitness accounts , wrote in 1821 : How I should like to be able to show our cleverest painters several portraits , which are such close resemblances to nature , whose easy pose leaves nothing to be desired , and of which one can really say that all they lack is the power of speech:9 In 185o Delacroix wrote : I have told myself a hundred times that painting ? that is to say , the material thing called painting ? was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the painter and that of the spectator . ' 1 ? For Corot experience was a far less flamboyant and more modest affair than for the Romantics . But nevertheless he still emphasized how essential the personal and the relative are to art . In 1856 he // wrote : Reality is one part of art : feeling completes it . . . before any site and any object , abandon yourself to your first impression . If you have really been touched , you will convey to others the sincerity of your emotion . ' 1 i Zola , who was one of the first defenders of the Impressionists , defined a work of art as a corner of nature seen through a temperament ' . The definition applies to the whole of the nineteenth century and is another way of describing the same metaphorical model . Monet was the most theoretical of the Impressionists and the most anxious to break through the century 's barrier of subjectivity . For him ( at least theoretically ) the role of his temperament was reduced to that of the process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature . But the result of this fusion , however harmonious , is a sense of powerlessness ? which suggests that , bereft of his subjectivity , he has nothing to put in its place . Nature is no longer a field for study , it has become an overwhelming force . One way or another the confrontation between the artist and nature in the nineteenth century is an unequal one . Either the heart of man or the grandeur of nature dominates . Monet wrote : I have painted for half a century , and will soon have passed my sixty-ninth year , but , far from decreasing , my sensitivity has sharpened with age . As long as constant contact with the outside world can sustain the ardour of my curiosity , and my hand remains the quick and faithful servant of my perception , I have nothing to fear from old age . I have no other wish than a close fusion with nature , and I desire no other fate than ( according to Goethe ) to have worked and lived in harmony with her rules . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human creature seems but a miserable atom . I am well aware of the schematic nature of this brief survey . Is not Delacroix in some senses a transitional figure between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries ? And was not Raphael another transitional figure who confounds such simple categories ? The scheme , however , is true enough to help us appreciate the nature of the change which Cubism represented . // The metaphorical model of Cubism is the diagram : the diagram being a visible , symbolic representation of invisible processes , forces , structures . A diagram need not eschew certain aspects of appearances : but these too will be treated symbolically as signs , not as imitations or re-creations . The model of the diagram differs from that of the mirror in that it suggests a concern with what is not self-evident . It differs from the model of the theatre stage in that it does not have to concentrate upon climaxes but can reveal the continuous . It differs from the model of the personal account in that it aims at a general truth . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconstructed examples from nature in order to transcend nature . The nineteenth-century artist experienced nature . The Cubist realized that his awareness of nature was part of nature . Heisenberg speaks as a modern physicist . Natural science does not simply describe and explain nature ; it is part of the interplay between nature and ourselves : it describes nature as exposed to our method of questioning.i12 Similarly , the frontal facing of nature became inadequate in art . How did the Cubists express their imitation of the new relation existing between man and nature ? t By their use of space Cubism broke the illusionist three-dimensional space which had existed in painting since the Renaissance . It did not destroy it . Nor did it muffle it ? as Gauguin and the Pont-Aven school had done . It broke its continuity . There is space in a Cubist painting in that one form can be inferred to be behind another . But the relation between any two forms does not , as it does in illusionist space , establish the rule for all the spatial relationships between all the forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightmarish deformation of space , because the two-dimensional surface of the picture is always there as arbiter and resolver of different claims . The picture surface S // acts in a Cubist painting as the constant which allows us to appreciate the variables . Before and after every sortie of our imagination into the problematic spaces and through the interconnections of a Cubist painting , we find our gaze resettled on the picture surface , aware once more of two-dimensional shapes on a two-dimensional board or canvas . This makes it impossible to confront the objects or forms in a Cubist work . Not only because of the multiplicity of viewpoints ? so that , say , a view of a table from below is combined with a view of the table from above and from the side ? but also because the forms portrayed never present themselves as a totality . The totality is the surface of the picture , which is now the origin and sum of all that one sees . The viewing point of Renaissance perspective , fixed and outside the picture , but to which everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vision which is the picture itself . It took Picasso and Braque three years to arrive at this extraordinary transformation . In most of their pictures from 1907 to 1910 there are still compromises with Renaissance space . The effect of this is to deform the subject . The figure or landscape becomes the construction , instead of the construction being the picture acting as an expression of the relation between viewer and subject.13 After I910 all references to appearances are made as signs on the picture surface . A circle for a top of a bottle , a lozenge for an eye , letters for a newspaper , a volute for the head of a violin , etc . Collage was an extension of the same principle . Part of the actual or imitation surface of an object was stuck on to the surface of the picture as a sign referring to , but not imitating , its appearance . A little later painting borrowed from this experience of collage , so that , say , a pair of lips or a bunch of grapes might be referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece ofwhite paper stuck on to the picture surface . 2 By their treatment ofform It was this which gave the Cubists their name . They were said to paint everything in cubes . Afterwards this was connected with Cezanne 's // remark : Treat nature by the cylinder , by the sphere , the cone , everything in proper perspective . ' And from then on the misunderstanding has continued ? encouraged , let it be said , by a lot of confused assertions by some of the lesser Cubists themselves . The misunderstanding is that the Cubist wanted to simplify ? for the sake of simplification . In some of the Picassos and Braques of 1908 it may look as though this is the case . Before finding their new vision , they had to jettison traditional complexities . But their aim was to arrive at a far more complex image of reality than had ever been attempted in painting before . To appreciate this we must abandon a habit of centuries : the habit of looking at every object or body as though it were complete in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were concerned with the interaction between objects . They reduced forms to a combination of cubes , cones , cylinders ? or , later , to arrangements of flatly articulated facets or planes with sharp edges ? so that the elements of any one form were interchangeable with another , whether a hill , a woman , a violin , a carafe , a table or a hand . Thus , as against the Cubist discontinuity of space , they created a continuity of structure . Yet when we talk of the Cubist discontinuity of space , it is only to distinguish it from the convention of linear Renaissance perspective . Space is part of the continuity of the events within it . It is in itself an event , comparable with other events . It is not a mere container . And this is what the few Cubist masterpieces show us . The space between objects is part of the same structure as the objects themselves . The forms are simply reversed so that , say , the top of a head is a convex element and the adjacent space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Cubists created the possibility of art revealing processes instead of static entities . The content of their art consists of various modes of interaction : the interaction between different aspects of the same event , between empty space and filled space , between structure and movement , between the seer and the thing seen . // Rather than ask of a Cubist picture : Is it true ? or : Is it sincere ? one should ask : Does it continue ? Today it is easy to see that , since Cubism , painting has become more and more diagrammatic , even when there has been no direct Cubist influence ? as , say , in Surrealism . Eddie Wolfram in an article about Francis Bacon has written : Painting today functions directly as a conceptual activity in philosophical terms and the art object acts only as a cypher reference to tangible reality . " 4 This was part of the Cubist prophecy . But only part . Byzantine art might equally well be accommodated within Wolfram 's definition . To understand the full Cubist prophecy we must examine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Bottle and Glasses ' of 1911 is two-dimensional insofar as one 's eye comes back again and again to the surface of the picture . We start from the surface , we follow a sequence of forms which leads into the picture , and then suddenly we arrive back at the surface again and deposit our newly acquired knowledge upon it , before making another foray . This is why I called the Cubist picture-surface the origin and sum of all that we can see in the picture . There is nothing decorative about such twodimensionality , nor is it merely an area offering possibilities of juxtaposition for dissociated images ? as in the case of much recent neo-Dadaist or pop art . We begin with the surface , but since everything in the picture refers back to the surface we begin with the conclusion . We then search ? not for an explanation , as we do if presented with an image with a single , predominant meaning ( a man laughing , a mountain , a reclining nude ) , but for some understanding of the configuration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When we deposit our newly acquired knowledge upon the picture surface ' , what we in fact do is find the sign for what we have just discovered : a sign which was always there but which previously we could not read . To make the point clearer it is worth comparing a Cubist picture // with any work in the Renaissance tradition . Let us say Pollaiuolo 's Martyrdom of St Sebastian ' . In front of the Pollaiuolo the spectator completes the picture . It is the spectator who draws the conclusions and infers all except the aesthetic relations between the pieces of evidence offered ? the archers , the martyr , the plain laid out behind , etc . It is he who through his reading of what is portrayed seals its unity of meaning . The work is presented to him . One has the feeling almost that St Sebastian was martyred so that he should be able to explain this picture . The complexity of the forms and the scale of the space depicted enhance the sense of achievement , of grasp . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are what the picture is made of . They are its content . The spectator has to find his place within this content whilst the complexity of the forms and the discontinuity ' of the space remind him that his view from that place is bound to be only partial . Such content and its functioning was prophetic because it coincided with the new scientific view of nature which rejected simple causality and the single permanent all-seeing viewpoint . Heisenberg writes : One may say that the human ability to understand may be in a certain sense unlimited . But the existing scientific concepts cover always only a very limited part of reality , and the other part that has not yet been understood is infinite . Whenever we proceed from the known to the unknown we may hope to understand , but we may have to learn at the same time a new meaning of the word understanding.15 Such a notion implies a change in the methodology of research and invention . W. Grey Walter , the physiologist , writes : Classical physiology , as we have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? in any experiment there could be only one thing at a time under investigation . . . We can not extract one independent variable in the classical manner ; we have to deal with the interaction of many unknowns and variables , all the time . . . In practice , this implies that not one but many ? as many as possible ? observations must be made at once and compared with one another , and that whenever possible a simple known variable should be Igo THE MOMENT OF CUBISM used to modify the several complex unknowns so that their tendencies and interdependence can be assessed.16 The best Cubist works of 1910 , 191 I and 1912 were sustained and precise models for the method of searching and testing described above . That is to say , they force the senses and imagination of the spectator to calculate , omit , doubt and conclude according to a pattern which closely resembles the one involved in scientific observation . The difference is a question of appeal . Because the act of looking at a picture is far less concentrated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the spectator 's previous experience . Art is concerned with memory : experiment is concerned with predictions . Outside the modern laboratory , the need to adapt oneself constantly to presented totalities ? rather than making inventories or supplying a transcendental meaning as in front of the Pollaiuolo ? is a feature of modern experience which affects everybody through the mass media and modern communication systems . Marshall McLuhan is a manic exaggerator , but he has seen certain truths clearly : In the electric age , when our central nervous system is technologically extended to involve us in the whole of mankind and to incorporate the whole of mankind in us , we necessarily participate , in depth , in the consequences of our every action ... The aspiration of our time for wholeness , empathy and depth of awareness is a natural adjunct of electric technology . The age of mechanical industry that preceded us found vehement assertion of private outlook the natural mode of expression . . . The mark of our time is its revolution against imposed patterns . We are suddenly eager to have things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first artists to attempt to paint totalities rather than agglomerations . I must emphasize again that the Cubists were not aware of all that we are now reading into their art . Picasso and Braque and Leger kept silent because they knew that they might be doing more than they // knew . The lesser Cubists tended to believe that their break with tradition had freed them from the bondage of appearances so that they might deal with some kind of spiritual essence . The idea that their art coincided with the implications of certain new scientific and technological developments was entertained but never fully worked out . There is no evidence at all that they recognized as such the qualitative change which had taken place in the world . It is for these reasons that I have constantly referred to their intimation of a transformed world : it amounted to no more than that . One can not explain the exact dates of the maximum Cubist achievement . Why 1910 to 1912 rather than 1905 to 1907 ? Nor is it possible to explain exactly why certain artists , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the world ? artists ranging from Bonnard to Duchamp or de Chirico . To do so we would need to know an impossible amount about each separate individual development . ( In that impossibility ? which is an absolute one ? lies our freedom from determinism . ) We have to work with partial explanations . With the advantage of sixty years ' hindsight , the correlations I have tried to establish between Cubism and the rest of history seem to me to be undeniable . The precise route of the connections remains unknown . They do not inform us about the intentions of the artists : they do not explain exactly why Cubism took place in the manner it did ; but they do help to disclose the widest possible continuing meaning of Cubism . Two more reservations . Because Cubism represented so fundamental a revolution in the history of art , I have had to discuss it as though it were pure theory . Only in this way could I make its revolutionary content clear . But naturally it was not pure theory . It was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cubist paintings full of anomalies and marvellous gratuitous tenderness and confused excitement . We see the beginning in the light of the conclusions it suggested . But it was only a beginning , and a beginning cut short . // For all their insight into the inadequacy of appearances and of the frontal view of nature , the Cubists used such appearances as their means of reference to nature . In the maelstrom of their new constructions , their liaison with the events which provoked them is shown by way of a simple , almost naive reference to a pipe stuck in the sitter 's ' mouth , a bunch of grapes , a fruit dish or the title of a daily newspaper . Even in some of the most hermetic ' paintings ? for example Braque 's Le Portugais ' ? you can find naturalistic allusions to details of the subject 's appearance , such as the buttons on the musician 's jacket , buried intactwithin the construction . There are only a very few works ? for instance Picasso 's Le Modele ' of 1912 ? where such allusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both intellectual and sentimental . The naturalistic allusions seemed necessary in order to offer a measure for judging the transformation . Perhaps also the Cubists were reluctant to part with appearances because they suspected that in art they could never be the same again . The details are smuggled in and hidden as mementoes . The second reservation concerns the social content of Cubism ? or , rather , its lack of it . One can not expect of a Cubist painting the same kind of social content as one finds in a Brueghel or a Courbet . The mass media and the arrival of new publics have profoundly changed the social role of the fine arts . It remains true , however , that the Cubists ? during the moment of Cubism ? were unconcerned about the personalized human and social implications of what they were doing . This , I think , is because they had to simplify . The problem before them was so complex that their manner of stating it and their trying to solve it absorbed all their attention . As innovators they wanted to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they took as subjects whatever was at hand and made least demands . The content of these works is the relation between the seer and the seen . This relation is only possible given the fact that the seer inherits a precise historical , economic and social // situation . Otherwise they become meaningless . They do not illustrate a human or social situation , they posit it . I spoke of the continuing meaning of Cubism . To some degree this meaning has changed and will change again according to the needs of the present . The bearings we read with the aid of Cubism vary according to our position . What is the reading now ? It is being more and more urgently claimed that the modern tradition ' begins with Jarry , Duchamp and the Dadaists . This confers legitimacy upon the recent developments of neo-Dadaism , autodestructive art , happenings , etc . The claim implies that what separates the characteristic art of the twentieth century from the art of all previous centuries is its acceptance of unreason , its social desperation , its extreme subjectivity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the original Dadaist spokesmen , wrote : The Renaissance taught men the haughty exaltation of their reason . Modern times , with their science and technology , turned men towards megalomania . The confusion of our epoch results from this overestimation of reason . ' And elsewhere : The law of chance , which embraces all other laws and is as unfathomable to us as the depths from which all life arises , can only be comprehended by complete surrender to the Unconscious . ' s Arp 's statements are repeated today with a slightly modified vocabulary by all contemporary apologists of outrageous art . ( I use the word outrageous ' descriptively and not in a pejorative sense . ) During the intervening years , the Surrealists , Picasso , de Chirico , Mini , Klee , Dubuffet , the Abstract Expressionists and many others can be drafted into the same tradition : the tradition whose aim is to cheat the world of its hollow triumphs , and disclose its pain . The example of Cubism forces us to recognize that this is a one-sided interpretation of history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doubt and transition the majority of artists // have always tended to be preoccupied with the fantastic , the uncontrollable and the horrific . The greater extremism of contemporary artists is the result of their having no fixed social role ; to some degree they can create their own . But there are precedents for the spirit of it in the history of other activities : heretical religions , alchemy , witchcraft , etc . The real break with tradition , or the real reformation of that tradition , occurred with Cubism itself . The modern tradition , based on a qualitatively different relationship being established between man and the world , began , not in despair , but in affirmation . The proof that this was the objective role of Cubism lies in the fact that , however much its spirit was rejected , it supplied to all later movements the primary means of their own liberation . That is to say , it re-created the syntax of art so that it could accommodate modern experience . The proposition that a work of art is a new object and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a picture to admit the coexistence of different modes of space and time , the inclusion in a work of art of extraneous objects , the dislocation of forms to reveal movement or change , the combining of hitherto separate and distinct media , the diagrammatic use of appearances ? these were the revolutionary innovations of Cubism . It would be foolish to underestimate the achievements of postCubist art . Nevertheless it is fair to say that in general the art of the post-Cubist period has been anxious and highly subjective . What the evidence of Cubism should prevent us doing is concluding from this that anxiety and extreme subjectivity constitute the nature of modern art . They constitute the nature of art in a period of extreme ideological confusion and inverted political frustration . During the first decade of this century a transformed world became theoretically possible and the necessary forces of change could already be recognized as existing . Cubism was the art which reflected the possibility of this transformed world and the confidence it inspired . Thus , in a certain sense , it was the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex ? which has yet existed . // The vision of the Cubist moment still coincides with what is technologically possible . Yet three-quarters of the world remain undernourished and the foreseeable growth of the world 's population is outstripping the production of food . Meanwhile millions of the privileged are the prisoners of their own sense of increasing powerlessness . The political struggle will be gigantic in its range and duration . The transformed world will not arrive as the Cubists imagined it . It will be born of a longer and more terrible history . We can not see the end of the present period of political inversion , famine and exploitation . But the moment of Cubism reminds us that , if we are to be representative of our century ? and not merely its passive creatures ? the aim of achieving that end must constantly inform our consciousness and decisions . The moment at which a piece of music begins provides a clue to the nature of all art . The incongruity of that moment , compared to the uncounted , unperceived silence which preceded it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that incongruity and the shock which accompanies it ? It is to be found in the distinction between the actual and the desirable . All art is an attempt to define and make unnatural this distinction . For a long time it was thought that art was the imitation and celebration of nature . The confusion arose because the concept of nature itself was a projection of the desired . Now that we have cleansed our view of nature , we see that art is an expression of our sense of the inadequacy of the given ? which we are not obliged to accept with gratitude . Art mediates between our good fortune and our disappointment . Sometimes it mounts to a pitch of horror . Sometimes it gives permanent value and meaning to the ephemeral . Sometimes it describes the desired . Thus art , however free or anarchic its mode of expression , is always a plea for greater control and an example , within the artificial limits of a medium ' , of the advantages of such control . Theories // about the artist 's inspiration are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which his work has upon us . The only inspiration which exists is the intimation of our own potential . Inspiration is the mirror image of history : by means of it we can see our past , while turning our back upon it . And it is precisely this which happens at the instant when a piece of music begins . We suddenly become aware of the previous silence at the same moment as our attention is concentrated upon following sequences and resolutions which will contain the desired . The Cubist moment was such a beginning , defining desires which are still unmet . The eyes of Claude Monet Too much has been made of Cezanne 's famous remark that , if Monet was only an eye , what an eye ! More important now , perhaps , to acknowledge and question the sadness in Monet 's eyes , a sadness which emerges from photograph after photograph . Little attention has been paid to this sadness because there is no place for it in the usual art-historical version of the meaning of Impressionism . Monet was the leader of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Impressionism was the beginning of Modernism , a kind of triumphal arch through which European art passed to enter the twentieth century . There is some truth in this version . Impressionism did mark a break with the previous history of European painting and a great deal of what followed ? Post-Impressionism , Expressionism , Abstraction ? can be thought of as being partly engendered by this first modern movement . It is equally true that today , after half a century , Monet 's later works ? and particularly the water lilies ? appear now to have prefigured the work of artists such as Pollock , Tobey , Sam Francis , Rothko . It is possible to argue , as Malevich did , that the twenty paintings which Monet made in the early 189os of the facade of Rouen Cathedral , as seen at different times of day and under different weather conditions , were the final systematic proof that the history of painting would never be the same again . This history had henceforward to admit that every appearance could be thought of as a mutation and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thinks of the claustrophobia of midnineteenth-century bourgeois culture , it is impossible not to see how // Impressionism appeared as a liberation . To paint out of doors in front of the motif ; to observe directly , to accord to light its proper hegemony in the domain of the visible ; to relativize all colours ( so that everything sparkles ) ; to abandon the painting of dusty legends and all direct ideology ; to speak of everyday appearances within the experience of a wide urban public ( a day off , a trip to the country , boats , smiling women in sunlight , flags , trees in flower ? the Impressionist vocabulary of images is that of a popular dream , the awaited , beloved , secular Sunday ) ; the innocence of Impressionism ? innocence in the sense that it did away with the secrets of painting , everything was there in the full light of day , there was nothing more to hide , and amateur painting followed easily ? how could all this not be thought of as a liberation ? Why ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply acknowledge it as something personal to him , the result of his early poverty , the death of his first wife when so young , his failing eyesight when old ? And in any case , are we not running the risk of explaining the history of Egypt as the consequence of Cleopatra 's smile ? Let us run the risk . Twenty years before painting the facade of Rouen Cathedral , Monet painted ( he was thirty-two years old ) Impression Soleil Levant ' , and from this the critic Castagnary coined the term Impressionist . The painting is a view of the port of Le Havre where Monet was brought up as a child . In the foreground is the tiny silhouette of a man standing and rowing with another figure in a dinghy . Across the water , masts and derricks are dimly visible in the morning twilight . Above , but low in the sky , is a small orange sun and , below , its inflamed reflection in the water . It is not an image of dawn ( Aurora ) , but of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood is reminiscent of Baudelaire 's Le Crepuscule de Matin ' , in which the coming day is compared to the sobbing of somebody who has just been woken . Yet what is it that exactly constitutes the melancholy of this painting ? Why , for example , do n't comparable scenes , as painted by // Turner , evoke a similar mood ? The answer is the painting method , precisely that practice which was to be called Impressionist . The transparency of the thin pigment representing the water ? the thread of the canvas showing through it , the swift broken-straw-like brush strokes suggesting ripples of spars , the scrubbed-in areas of shadow , the reflections staining the water , the optical truthfulness and the objective vagueness , all this renders the scene makeshift , threadbare , decrepit . It is an image of homelessness . Its very insubstantiality makes shelter in it impossible . Looking at it , the idea occurs to you of a man trying to find his road home through a theatre decor . Baudelaire 's lines in La Cygne ' , published in 186o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuracy and the refusal of this scene . ... La forme d'une ville Change plus vite , helas , que le coeur d'un mortel . If Impressionism was about impressions ' , what change did this imply in the relation between seen and seer ? ( Seer here meaning both painter and viewer . ) You do not have an impression of a scene with which you feel yourself to be longstandingly familiar . An impression is more or less fleeting ; it is what is left behind because the scene has disappeared or changed . Knowledge can coexist with the known ; an impression , by contrast , survives alone . However intensely and empirically observed at the moment , an impression later becomes , like a memory , impossible to verify . ( Throughout his life Monet complained , in letter after letter , about not being able to complete a painting already begun , because the weather and therefore the subject , the motif , had irredeemably changed . ) The new relation between scene and seer was such that now the scene was more fugitive , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to the same lines by Baudelaire : La forme d'une ville .. Suppose we examine the experience offered by a more typical Impressionist painting . In the spring of the same year as Le Soleil // Levant ' ( 1872 ) Monet painted two pictures of a lilac tree in his garden at Argenteuil . One shows the tree on a cloudy day and the other on a sunny day . Lying on the lawn beneath the tree in both pictures are three barely distinguishable figures . ( They are thought to he Camille , Monet 's first wife , Sisley and Sisley 's wife . ) In the overcast picture these figures resemble moths in the lilac shade ; in the second , dappled with sunlight , they become almost as invisible as lizards . ( What betrays their presence is in fact the viewer 's past experience ; somehow the viewer distinguishes the mark of a profile with a tiny ear from the other almost identical marks which are only leaves . ) In the overcast picture the flowers of the lilac glow like mauve copper ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a newly lit fire : both are animated by a different kind of light energy , there is apparently no longer a trace of decrepitude , everything radiates . Purely optically ? Monet would have nodded his head . He was a man of few words . Yet it goes much further . Before the painted lilac tree you experience something unlike anything felt in front of any earlier painting . The difference is not a question of new optical elements , but of a new relation between what you are seeing and what you have seen . Every spectator can recognize this after a moment 's introspection ; all that may differ is the personal choice of which paintings reveal the new relation most vividly . There are hundreds of Impressionist paintings , painted during the I8 7os , to choose from . The painted lilac tree is both more precise and more vague than any painting you have seen before . Everything has been more or less sacrificed to the optical precision of its colours and tones . Space , measurement , action ( history ) , identity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must remember here that painted light , unlike the real thing , is not transparent . The painted light covers , buries , the painted objects , a little like snow covering a landscape . ( And the attraction of snow to Monet , the attraction of things being lost without a loss of first-degree reality , probably corresponded to a deep // psychological need . ) So the new energy is optical ? Monet was right to nod his head ? The painted light dominates everything ? No , because all this ignores how the painting actually works on the viewer . Given the precision and the vagueness , you are forced to re-see the lilacs of your own experience . The precision triggers your visual memory , while the vagueness welcomes and accommodates your memory when it comes . More than that , the uncovered memory of your sense of sight is so acutely evoked , that other appropriate memories of other senses ? scent , warmth , dampness , the texture of a dress , the length of an afternoon ? are also extracted from the past . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Correspondances . ) You fall through a kind of whirlpool of sense memories towards an ever receding moment of pleasure , which is a moment of total re-cognition . The intensity of this experience can be hallucinating . The fall into and towards the past with its mounting excitement , which , at the same time , is the mirror-opposite of expectation for it is a return , a withdrawal , has something about it which is comparable with an orgasm . Finally everything is simultaneous with and indivisible from the mauve fire of the lilac . And all this follows ? surprisingly ? from Monet 's affirmation , with slightly different words on several occasions , that the motif is for me altogether secondary ; what I want to represent is what exists between the motif and me ' ( 1895 ) . What he had in mind were colours ; what is bound to come into the viewer 's mind are memories . If , in a generalized way , Impressionism lends itself to nostalgia ( obviously in particular cases the intensity of the memories precludes nostalgia ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but simply because of the way the paintings always demanded to be read . What then has changed ? Previously the viewer entered into a painting . The frame or its edges were a threshold . A painting created its own time and space which were like an alcove to the world , and their experience , made clearer than it usually is in life , endured changeless and could be visited . This had little to do with the use of // any systematic perspective . It is equally true , say , of a Sung Chinese landscape . It is more a question of permanence than space . Even when the scene depicted was momentary ? for example , Caravaggio 's Crucifixion of St Peter ' ? the momentariness is held within a continuity : the arduous pulling up of the cross constitutes part of the permanent assembly point of the painting . Viewers passed one another in Pierro della Francesca 's Tent of Solomon ' or on Grunewald 's Golgotha ' or in the bedroom of Rembrandt . But not in Monet 's Gare de St Lazare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What an Impressionist painting shows is painted in such a way that you are compelled to recognize that it is no longer there . It is here and here only that Impressionism is close to photography . You can not enter an Impressionist painting ; instead it extracts your memories . In a sense it is more active than you ? the passive viewer is being born ; what you receive is taken from what happens between you and it . No more within it . The memories extracted are often pleasurable ? sunlight , river banks , poppy fields ? yet they are also anguished , because each viewer remains alone . The viewers are as separate as the brush strokes . There is no longer a common meeting place . Let us now return to the sadness in Monet 's eyes . Monet believed that his art was forward-looking and based on a scientific study of nature . Or at least this is what he began by believing and never renounced . The degree of sublimation involved in such a belief is poignantly demonstrated by the story of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She died in 1879 , aged thirty-two . Many years later Monet confessed to his friend Clemenceau that his need to analyse colours was both the joy and torment of his life . To the point where , he went on to say , I one day found myself looking at my beloved wife 's dead face and just systematically noting the colours , according to an automatic reflex ! Without doubt the confession was sincere , yet the evidence of the painting is quite otherwise . A blizzard of white , grey , purplish paint blows across the pillows of the bed , a terrible blizzard of loss which // will for ever efface her features . In fact there can be very few death-bed paintings which have been so intensely felt or subjectively expressive . And yet to this ? the consequence of his own act of painting ? Monet was apparently blind . The positivistic and scientific claims he made for his art never accorded with its true nature . The same was equally true of his friend Zola . Zola believed that his novels were as objective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so evident in Germinal ) comes from deep ? and dark ? unconscious feeling . At this period the mantle of progressive positivist enquiry sometimes hid the very same premonition of loss , the same fears , of which , earlier , Baudelaire had been the prophet . And this explains why memory is the unacknowledged axis of all Monet 's work . His famous love of the sea ( in which he wanted to be buried when he died ) , of rivers , of water , was perhaps a symbolic way of speaking of tides , sources , recurrence . In 1896 he returned to paint again one of the cliffs near Dieppe which he had painted on several occasions fourteen years earlier . ( ' Falaise a Vavengeville ' , Gorge du Petit-Ailly ' . ) The painting , like many of his works of the same period , is heavily worked , encrusted , and with the minimum of tonal contrast . It reminds you of thick honey . Its concern is no longer the instantaneous scene , as revealed in the light , but rather the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development which led towards a more decorative art . Or at least this is the usual explanation ' based on Monet 's own premises . It seems to me that this painting is about something quite different . Monet worked on it , day after day , believing that he was interpreting the effect of sunlight as it dissolved every detail of grass and shrub into a cloth of honey hung by the sea . But he was n't , and the painting has really very little to do with sunlight . What he himself was dissolving into the honey cloth were all his previous memories of that cliff , so that it should absorb and contain them all . It is this almost desperate wish to save all , which makes it such an amorphous , flat ( and yet , if one recognizes it for what it is , touching ) image . // And something very similar is happening in Monet 's paintings of the water lilies in his garden during the last period of his life ( 1900 ? 26 ) at Giverny . In these paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of combining flowers , reflections , sunlight , underwater reeds , refractions , ripples , surface , depths , the real aim was neither decorative nor optical ; it was to preserve everything essential about the garden , which he had made , and which now as an old man he loved more than anything else in the world . The painted lily pond was to be a pond that remembered all . And here is the crux of the contradiction which Monet as a painter lived . Impressionism closed the time and space in which previously painting had been able to preserve experience . And , as a result of this closure , which of course paralleled and was finally determined by other developments in late-nineteenth-century society , both painter and viewer found themselves more alone than even before , more ridden by the anxiety that their own experience was ephemeral and meaningless . Not even all the charm and beauty of the Ile de France , a Sunday dream of paradise , was a consolation for this . Only Cezanne understood what was happening . Single-handed , impatient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Impressionists had , he set himself the monumental task of creating a new form of time and space within the painting , so that finally experience might again be shared . The work of art It has taken me a long time to come to terms with my reactions to Nicos Hadjinicolaou 's book Art History and Class Consciousness . ) These reactions are complex for both theoretical reasons and personal ones . Nicos Hadjinicolaou sets out to define the possible practice of a scientific Marxist art history . How necessary it is to produce this initiative , first proposed by Max Raphael nearly fifty years ago ! The exemplary figure of the book , one could almost say its chosen father , is the late Frederick Antal . To see at last this great art historian 's work being recognized is a heartening experience ; the more so for me personally because I was once an unofficial student of Antal 's . He was my teacher , he encouraged me , and a great deal of what I understand by art history I owe to him . Two pupils of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause . Yet I am obliged to argue against this book as a matter of principle . Hadjinicolaou 's scholarship is impressive and well used ; his arguments are courageously clear . In France , where he lives , he has helped to form with other Marxist colleagues the Association Histoire et Critiques des Arts , which has held several notable and important conferences . My argument will , I hope , be fierce but not dismissive . Let me first try to summarize the book as fairly as I can . The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles . ' Opening with this quotation from the Communist Manifesto , Hadjinicolaou asks : how should this apply to the discipline of art history ? He dismisses as over-simple the answers of vulgar ' Marxism which seek direct evidence of the class struggle in the class origins // and political opinions of the painter or , alternatively , in the story the painting tells . He recognizes the relative autonomy of the production-of-pictures ( a term which he prefers to art because implicit in the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He argues that pictures have their own ideology ? a visual one , which must not be confused with political , economic , colonial and other ideologies . For him an ideology is the systematic way in which a class or a section of a class projects , disguises and justifies its relations to the world . Ideology is a social/historical element ? encompassing like water ? from which it is impossible to emerge until classes have been abolished . The most one can do is identify an ideology and relate it to its precise class function . By visual ideology he means the way that a picture makes you see the scene it represents . In some ways it is similar to the category of style , yet it is more comprehensive . He regrets totally the ordinary connotations of style . There is no such thing as the style of an artist . Rembrandt has no style , everything depends upon which picture Rembrandt was producing under what circumstances . The way each picture renders experience visible constitutes its visual ideology . Yet in considering the visible ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember that according to such a theory of ideology ( which owes a lot to Althusser and Poulantzas ) we are , in some ways , like blind men who have to learn to allow for and overcome our blindness , but to whom sight itself , whilst class societies continue , can not be accorded . The negative implication of this becomes crucial as I shall try to show later . The task of a scientific art history is to examine any picture , to identify its visual ideology and to relate it to the class history of its time , a complex history because classes are never homogeneous and consist of many conflicting groups and interests . The traditional schools of art history are unscientific . He examines each in turn . The first treats art history as if it were no more than a history of great painters and then explains them in psychological , // psychoanalytical or environmental terms . To treat art history as if it were a relay race of geniuses is an individualist illusion , whose origins in the Renaissance corresponded with the phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something similar in Ways of Seeing . The immense theoretical weakness of my own book is that I do not make clear what relation exists between what I call the exception ' ( the genius ) and the normative tradition . It is at this point that work needs to be done . It could well be the theme of a conference . A second school sees art history as part of the history of ideas ( Jacob Burckhardt , Aby Warburg , Panofsky , Saxl ) . The weakness of this school is to avoid the specificity of the language of painting and to treat it as if it were a hieroglyphic text of ideas . As for the ideas themselves , they tend to be thought of as emanating from a Zeitgeist who , in class terms , is immaculate and virgin . I find the criticisms valid . The third school is that of formalism ( Wolfflin , Riegl ) which sees art as a history of formal structures . Art , independent of both artists and society , has its own life coiled in its forms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decadence . A painter inherits a style at a certain stage of its spiral development . Like all organic theories applied to highly socialized activities ? mistaking history for nature ? the formalist school leads to reactionary conclusions . Against each of these schools Hadjinicolaou fights as valiantly as David , armed with his sling of visual ideology . The proper subject matter of art history as an autonomous science ' is the analysis and explanation of the visual ideologies which have appeared in history ' . Only such ideologies can explain art . Aesthetic effect ' ? the enhancement that a work of art offers ? is none other than the pleasure felt by the observer when he recognizes himself in a picture 's visual ideology . ' The disinterested ' emotion of classical aesthetics turns out to be a precise class interest . Now , within the logic of Althusserian Marxism and its field of // ideological formulations , this is an elegant if abstract formula . And it has the advantage of cutting the interminable knotting of the obsolete discourse of bourgeois aesthetics . It may also go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the history of taste : for example , the neglect during centuries after their original fame of painters as different as Franz Hats and El Greco . The formula would seem to cover retrospectively Antal 's practice as an art historian . In his formidable study on Florentine painting ? as well as in other works ? Antal set out to show in detail how sensitive painting was to economic and ideological developments . Singlehanded he disclosed , with all the rigour of a European scholar , a new seam of content in pictures , and through this seam ran the class struggle . But I do not think that he believed that this explained the phenomenon of art . His respect for art was such that he could not forgive , as Marx could not forgive , the history he studied . And Marx himself posed the question which the formula of visual ideology can not answer . If art is bound up with certain phases of social historical development , how is it that we still find , for example , classical Greek sculpture beautiful ? Hadjinicolaou replies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the while , that the sculptures seen by the nineteenth century were no longer the same art as seen by the third century BC . Yet the question remains : what then is it , about certain works which allows them to receive ' different interpretations and continue to offer a mystery ? ( Hadjinicolaou would consider the last word unscientific , but I do not . ) Max Raphael , in his two essays , The Struggle to UnderstandArt and Towards an Empirical Theory of Art ( 1941 ) , began with the same question posed by Marx and proceeded in exactly the opposite direction . Whereas Hadjinicolaou begins with the work as an object and looks for explanations prior to its production and following its production , Raphael believed that the explanation had to be sought in the process of production itself : the power of paintings lay in their painting . Art and the study of art lead from the work to the process of creation . ' // For Raphael , The work of art holds man 's creative powers in a crystalline suspension from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything therefore depends upon this crystalline suspension , which occurs in history , subject to its conditions , and yet at another level defies those conditions . Raphael shared Marx 's doubt ; he recognized that historical materialism and its categories as so far developed could only explain certain aspects of art . They could not explain why art is capable of defying the flow of historical process and time . Yet Raphael proposed an empirical ? not an idealist ? answer . Art is an interplay , an equation of three factors ? the artist , the world and the means of figuration . ' A work of art can not be considered as either a simple object or simple ideology . It is always a synthesis between nature ( or history ) and the mind , and as such it acquires a certain autonomy vis-a-vis both these elements . This independence seems to be created by man and hence to possess a psychic reality ; but in point of fact the process of creation can become an existent only because it is embedded in some concrete material . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this material has been worked by the artist it becomes like no other existing material : what the image represents ( a head and shoulders , say ) is pressed , embedded into this material , whilst the material by being worked into a representational image acquires a certain immaterial character . And it is this which gives works of art their incomparable energy . They exist in the same sense that a current exists : it can not exist without substances and yet it is not in itself a simple substance . None of this precludes visual ideologies ' . But Raphael 's theory is bound to situate them as one factor amongst others within the act of painting ; they can not form the simple grid through which the artist sees and the spectator looks . Hadjinicolaou wants to avoid the reductionism of vulgar Marxism , yet he replaces it with another because he has no theory about the act of painting or the act of looking at pictures . The lack becomes obvious as soon as he considers the visual 20I THE WORK OF ART ideology of particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , between a Louis David portrait painted in 1781 , the David painting of The Death of Marat ' of 1793 , and his painting of Madame Recamier ' of 1800 . He has to say this because , if a painting consists of nothing but visual ideology , and these three paintings clearly have different visual ideologies reflecting the history of the Revolution , they can not have anything in common . David 's experience as a painter is irrelevant , and our experience as spectators of David 's experience is also irrelevant . And there 's the rub . The real experience of looking at paintings has been eliminated . When Hadjinicolaou goes further and equates the visual ideology of Madame Recamier ' with that of a portrait by Girodet , one realizes that the visual content to which he is referring goes no deeper than the mise-en-scene . The correspondence is at the level of clothes , furniture , hair-style , gesture , pose : at the level , if you wish , of manners and appearances ! Of course , there are paintings which do only function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit some of these paintings into history . But no painting of value is about appearances : it is about a totality of which the visible is no more than a code . And in face of such paintings the theory of visual ideology is helpless . To this Hadjinicolaou would reply that the term painting of value ' is meaningless . And in a sense I can not answer his objection because my own theory is weak about the relation existing between the exceptional work and the average . Nevertheless I would beg Hadjinicolaou and his colleagues to consider the possibility that their approach is self-defeating and retrograde , leading back to a reductionism not dissimilar in degree to Zhdanov 's and Stalin 's . The refusal of comparative judgments about art ultimately derives from a lack of belief in the purpose of art . One can only qualify X as better than Y if one believes that X achieves more , and this achievement has to be measured in relation to a goal . If paintings have no purpose , have no value other than their promotion of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old pictures except as // specialist historians . They become no more than a text for experts to decipher . The culture of capitalism has reduced paintings , as it reduces everything which is alive , to market commodities , and to an advertisement for other commodities . The new reductionism of revolutionary theory , which we are considering , is in danger of doing something similar . What the one uses as an advertisement ( for a prestige , a way of life and the commodities that go with it ) , the other sees as only a visual ideology of a class . Both eliminate art as a potential model of freedom , which is how artists and the masses have always treated art when it spoke to their needs . When a painter is working he is aware of the means which are available to him ? these include his materials , the style he inherits , the conventions he must obey , his prescribed or freely chosen subject matter ? as constituting both an opportunity and a restraint . By working and using the opportunity he becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , at either an artisanal , a magical or an imaginative level . He pushes against one or several of them . According to his character and historical situation , the result of his pushing varies from a barely discernible variation of a convention ? changing no more than the individual voice of a singer changes a melody ? to a fully original discovery , a breakthrough . Except in the case of the pure hack , who , needless to say , is a modern invention of the market , every painter from palaeolithic times onwards has experienced this will to push . It is intrinsic to the activity of rendering the absent present , of cheating the visible , of making images . Ideology partly determines the finished result , but it does not determine the energy flowing through the current . And it is with this energy that the spectator identifies . Every image used by a spectator is a going further than he could have achieved alone , towards a prey , a Madonna , a sexual pleasure , a landscape , a face , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , ' wrote Max Raphael , there appears that which he can not or can not yet do ? but which lies at the // root of all creativeness . ' A revolutionary scientific history of art has to come to terms with such creativeness. 204 Painting and time Paintings are static . The uniqueness of the experience of looking at a painting repeatedly ? over a period of days or years ? is that , in the midst of flux , the image remains changeless . Of course the significance of the image may change , as a result of either historical or personal developments , but what is depicted is unchanging : the same milk flowing from the same jug , the waves on the sea with exactly the same formation unbroken , the smile and the face which have not altered . One might be tempted to say that paintings preserve a moment . Yet on reflection this is obviously untrue . For the moment of a painting , unlike a moment photographed , never existed as such . And so a painting can not be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is not , like a photograph , preserving a moment of the past from the supersession of succeeding moments . I am thinking of the image within the frame , the scene which is depicted . Clearly if one considers an artist 's life-work or the history of art , one is treating paintings as being , partly , records of the past , evidence of what has been . Yet this historical view , whether used within a Marxist or idealist tradition , has prevented most art experts from considering ? or even noticing ? the problem of how time exists ( or does not ) within painting . In early Renaissance art , in paintings from non-European cultures , in certain modern works , the image implies a passage of time . Looking at it , the spectator sees before , during and after . The Chinese sage takes a walk from one tree to another , the carriage runs over the child , the nude descends the staircase . And this of course has been analysed and commented upon . Yet the ensuing image is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges , and this poses the problem of what is the meaning of that strange contrast between static and dynamic . Strange because it is both so flagrant and so taken for granted . Painters themselves practise a partial answer , even if it remains unformulated in words . When is a painting finished ? Not when it finally corresponds to something already existing ? like the second shoe of a pair ? but when the foreseen ideal moment of it being looked at is filled as the painter feels or calculates it should be filled . The long or short process of painting a picture is the process of constructing the future moments when it will be looked at . In reality , despite the painter 's ideal , these moments can not be entirely determined . They can never be entirely filled by the painting . Nevertheless the painting is entirely addressed to these moments . Whether the painter is a hack or a master makes no difference to the address ' of the painting . The difference is in what a painting delivers : in how closely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the painter , corresponds to the interests of the actual moments of its being looked at later by other people , when the circumstances surrounding its production ( patronage , fashion , ideology ) have changed . Some painters when working have a habit of studying their painting , when it has reached a certain stage , in a mirror . What they then see is the image reversed . If questioned about why this helps , they say that it allows them to see the painting anew , with a fresher eye . What they glimpse in the mirror is something like the content of the future moment to which the painting is being addressed . The mirror allows them to half-forget their own present vision as a painter , and to borrow something of the vision of a future spectator . What I am saying can perhaps be made sharper by again making a comparison with photographs . Photographs are records of the past . ( The importance of the role of the photographer and his subjectivity in this recording does not change the fact that photographs are records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophecies 2o6 PAINTING AND TIME about what the spectator is seeing in front of the painting at that moment . Some prophecies are quickly exhausted ? the painting loses its address ; others continue . Can not the same be said about other art forms ? Are not poems , stories , music addressed to the future in a similar way ? Often in their written forms they are . Nevertheless painting and sculpture are distinct . First because , even in their origin , they were not spontaneous performances . There is a sense in which a poem or story being spoken , or music being played , emphasizes the presence of the speaker or player . Whereas a visual image , so long as it is not being used as a mask or disguise , is always a comment on an absence . The depiction comments on the absence of what is being depicted . Visual images , based on appearances , always speak of disappearance . Secondly because , whereas verbal and musical language have a symbolic relation to what they signify , painting and sculpture have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all the more flagrant . Stories , poetry , music , belong to time and play within it . The static visual image denies time within itself . Hence its prophecies across and through time are the more startling . We can now ask what would have seemed at first an arbitrary question . Why is it that the still imagery ofpainting interests us ? What prevents painting being patently inadequate ? just because it is static ? To say that paintings prophesy the experience of their being looked at , does not answer the question . Rather one has to say that such prophecy assumes a continuing interest in the static image . Why , at least until recently , was such an assumption justified ? The conventional answer has been that , because painting is static , it has the power to establish a visually palpable ' harmony . Only something which is still can be so instantaneously composed , and therefore so complete . A musical composition , since it uses time , is obliged to have a beginning and an end . A painting only has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a physical object : within its imagery there is // neither beginning nor end . All this is what was meant by composition , pictorial harmony , significant form and so on . The terms of this explanation are both too restrictive and too aesthetic . There has to be a virtue in that flagrant contrast : the contrast between the unchanging painted form and the dynamic living model . What I have so far argued can now help us to locate this virtue . The stillness of the image was symbolic of timelessness . The fact that paintings were prophecies of themselves being looked at had nothing to do with the perspective of modern avant-gardism whereby the future vindicates the misunderstood prophet . What the present and the future had in common , and to which painting through its very stillness referred , was a substratum , a ground of timelessness . Until the nineteenth century all world cosmologies ? even including that of the European Enlightenment ? conceived of time as being in one way or another surrounded or infiltrated by timelessness . This timelessness constituted a realm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was where the dead went . It was intimately but invisibly related to the living world of time through ritual , stories and ethics . Only during the last hundred years ? since the acceptance of the Darwinian theory of evolution ? have people lived in a time that contains everything and sweeps everything away , and for which there is no realm of timelessness . In the galactic perspective proposed by such a cosmology , a hundred years are less than an instant . Even in the perspective of the history of man they can not yet be considered more than an aberration . When we consider this history of man we are faced by change and recurrence . History is change . What recurs are the subjects ( and objects ) of history : the lives of conscious women and men . What such consciousness works upon is subject to change and is part of the material of history . The character of such consciousness also changes . Yet some of its structures since the birth of language have probably not changed . Consciousness is pegged to certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attraction , social cooperation , death . The list is by no means exhaustive : one could add contingencies such as hunger , pleasure , fear . The nineteenth-century discovery of history as the terrain of human freedom inevitably led to an underestimation of the ineluctable and the continuous . It deposited the continuous within the flow of history ? i.e. the continuous was that which had a longer duration than the ephemeral . Previously , the continuous was thought of as the unchanging or timeless existing outside the flow of history . The language of pictorial art , because it was static , became the language of such timelessness . Yet what it spoke about ? unlike geometry ? was the sensuous , the particular and the ephemeral . Its mediation between the realm of the timeless and the visible and tangible was more total and poignant than that of any other art . Hence its iconic function , and special power . We can all still discover through introspection a vestige of this power . Consider a photograph . I have emphasized that photographs , unlike paintings , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the record is personal and there is a continuity within that personal life which reanimates the photograph . But , having said that , photographs are static images and they do refer to the ephemeral . Take an old family photograph . And you will find your imagination bifurcating : reconstructing the occasion , finding the date ; and , at the same time , grappling with the question : where is that moment now ? This bifurcation is a vestige of the response to the iconic power of painting when , cosmologically and philosophically , a realm of timelessness was acceptable . Needless to say the iconic power of pictorial art was used for diverse social and historical purposes , and the ideological function of art in a class society is part of that class history . Needless to say , too , that during the secularization of art its iconic power was often forgotten . Yet whenever a painting provoked deep emotion , something of this power reasserted itself . Indeed had pictorial art not possessed this power ? the power to speak with the language of // timelessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had any use for it . During the second half of the nineteenth century , as the Darwinian proposal about time became more and more dominant in all fields , the mediation of painting between the timeless and the ephemeral became more and more problematic , more and more difficult to sustain . On one hand , the represented moment of the ephemeral became briefer and briefer ; the Impressionists set out to represent one hour , the Expressionists an instant of subjective feeling ; on the other hand , the Pointillists and Futurists tried to abolish the static and timeless . Other artists like Mondrian insisted upon a geometry from which the ephemeral was banished altogether . Only the Cubists , as painters , sketched out a new cosmology in which relativity might have accorded the timeless a new place . But the Cubist sketch was destroyed by the First World War . After the war , the Surrealists made the unresolved problematic of time the constant theme of all their work ; all Surrealist paintings conjure up the time of dreams ; dreams being by then the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty years transatlantic painting has demonstrated how there is no longer anything left to mediate and therefore anything left to paint . The timeless ? as Rothko so intensely showed us ? had been emptied . The ephemeral has become the sole category of time . Banalized by pragmatism and consumerism , the ephemeral was excluded from abstract art , or fetishized as short-lived fashion in pop art and its derivatives . The ephemeral , no longer appealing to the timeless , becomes as trivial and instant as the fashionable . Without an acknowledged coexistence of the ephemeral and the timeless , there is nothing of consequence for pictorial art to do . Conceptual art is merely a discussion of this fact . An acknowledgment of the coexistence of the timeless and the ephemeral need not necessarily imply a return to earlier religious forms . It does , however , presume a radical questioning of something which most recent European thinking , including revolutionary 2r0
