A POLITICAL JOUKNIAL WASHINGTON , JULY 21 SS the men around President Rea gan tell it , things were coming along nicely until , out of the blue , the matter of " filched , " or " pil fered , " or whatever , briefing papers from the Carter White House during the 1980 campaign whanged into their well-laid plans . The economy was re covering , and this , they say , was re sulting in a sharp and dramatic im provement in the way people viewed the President  --  especially compared to last January , when , according to one of the President 's advisers , the polls were " fairly dismal . " The unexpected almost always does occur in the course of a political campaign ( whether or not the President is on one , his aides are ) . But no one was prepared for this particular oddity . Even how it arose was strange . The first reaction of the President 's people , and of Reagan himself , was to assume that the whole thing would blow over quickly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize as a big mistake : he did not appear to take it seriously , and even uttered a phrase ? " much ado about nothing " ? that could be , and was , turned back on him . Several of his advisers realized that his June 28th was largely admitted that they reached for the morning papers with a new interest . Once the story got going in the press , competitive instincts were kindled . The bureau chief of one important paper cut short his vacation to return to N'Vashington , and some reporters ' vacations were cancelled . But despite all the hubbub , and the fact that the story seemed to fly off on a number of tangents , some of them seemingly inconsequential , it was clear from an early stage that the questions at the heart of the matter were far from trivial . If in fact the Reagan people , in preparing Reagan for the 1980 debate with Carter , used papers that had been prepared for Carter , then the debate , a major event in the election , was a fraud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use papers obtained from the Carter White House , this was at the least a serious ethical breach . Campaigns do try to learn of each other 's plans , their poll data , their purchases of time for televi sion advertising , and the like , of course , but there does not seem to be any precedent for the use of a large number of documents obtained , by whatever means , from the other camp  --  not to mention from the White House . Moreover , a debate is a thing unto itself : it is a sporting event , in which each candidate is expected to come armed with his own material and try to trip up the other one . ( It is this sporting aspect , intensified by the press , that turns the debates into some thing they ought n't to he , but that is another subject . ) If one side knows what the other is going to do , it is not a fair fight . Few peo ple here suggest that Carter would have de feated Reagan in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a skilled debater , and Carter would have looked like the tense , bleached rabbit that he did that night anyway ( though it can never be known whether Rea gan would have made some major mis take , or appeared more ill at ease ) . But it is true that the stakes were very high and that the debate was a key event ? if not the key event  --  of the election . That there was only one debate ( an other problem , and also another sub  --  ject ) heightened its importance . At the time , Richard Wirthlin , Reagan 's pollster , told me , " Given the political environment , the election is going to hang or fall on that debate . " Another question was whether there was a systematic attempt to obtain informa  --  tion from within the Carter White House , some of it highly sensitive and perhaps classified . Was there , in fact , a literal intelligence operation mount  --  ed against the Carter White House ? There was also the question , of course , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way this seemed of lesser rank than the questions about whether there had been yet another perversion of the political process . It was these questions that kept the story going , loopy as it sometimes seemed to be . A side drama , but a drama that had both human interest and large implications in terms of the shape and nature of the Reagan Administration , was the im  --  pact of the controversy on some of the most important figures in that Admin  --  istration . The briefing-papers story , in retro  --  spect , ballooned rather quickly  --  in less than a month it grew from a minor item in the New York Times and the Washington Post into a major item on the television networks . The first newspaper mention of it , in the Tines and the Post , occurred on June 9th : both papers referred to a passage in " Gambling with History , " a new hook by Laurence Barrett , of Time , which said that before the debate a member of the Reagan campaign staff had " an unusual prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using . " Barrett had written : " Apparently a Reagan mole in the Carter camp had filched papers containing the main points the President planned to make when he met Reagan for the debate . " ( Barrett also wrote that the Reagan people were pleased that the papers " had included every important item Carter used on the air except one : his reference to his daughter , Amy , in connection with nuclear arms con  --  trol . " ) Jody Powell , Carter 's former press secretary , had begun to receive calls about the item in the Barrett hook , but no major story had appeared . So Powell , now a columnist , wrote a column about it , which appeared , among other places , in the following Sunday 's Post . Three days later , Pat  --  rick Caddell , Carter 's former pollster , went on the " Today " program to talk about the debate issue . Then , for a while , the story was out there , hanging in suspension , with former Carter aides anxiously trying to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporters to work on it and seeking to interest congressional Democrats in it . ( Peter Rodino , Democrat of New Jersey and chair  --  man of the House judi  --  ciary Committee , who presided over the im  --  peachment proceedings against Richard Nix  --  on , was not interest  --  ed . ) Then the Post reported that Reagan campaign aides did re  --  call receiving " several hundred pages of an  --  ticipated questions and answers from a Carter briefing book before the debate . " James Baker , the White House chief of staff , who had handled the arrangements for the debate for the Reagan campaign , remembered what was described in the Post as " a black notebook about three inches thick , with about three hundred pages in it , " and another former Reagan campaign aide remembered an unbound " wad of double-spaced question and answer pages . " To this moment , it remains unclear whether the Reagan people received the final briefing book pre  --  pared for Carter , which contained points about strategy as well as sub  --  stance  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier versions of it , without the strategy , as the Reagan people maintain . Nor is it clear what moral difference it makes . ( Actually , David Rubenstein , the Carter White House aide who was in charge of preparing the briefing book , says that even his preliminary drafts of questions and an  --  swers had strategy points in them . ) Meanwhile , the staff of a hitherto ob  --  scure subcommittee  --  the Human Re  --  sources Subcommittee of the House Post Office and Civil Service Commit  --  tee  --  which is headed by a hitherto unknown congressman , Donald Al  --  bosta , a Democrat from the central part of southern Michigan , had taken an interest . The subcommittee has ju  --  risdiction over the Ethics in Govern  --  ment Act . And , as occasionally happens , one small move set in motion big events . Albosta in mid-June sent off letters to Baker ; to David Gergen , now the communications director of the White House , who had worked with Baker on the debate arrangements ; to David Stockman , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had impersonated Carter during Reagan 's rehearsals for the debate ; and to Wil  --  liam Casey , the director of the Central Intelligence Agency , who had been the director of the Reagan 1980 cam  --  paign . Their apparently contradictory replies  --  Baker wrote that he remem  --  bered that he had been given " a large looseleaf bound book ( I believe in a black binder ) that was thought to have been given to the Reagan camp by someone with the Carter campaign , " and that it was his " best recollection " that Casey had given it to him " with the suggestion that it might be of use to the Debate Briefing Team ; " Casey wrote that he had " no recollection " of any papers " as described in Mr. Bar  --  rett 's account " ? set off an explosion . Stockman , in his letter to the subcom  --  mittee , recalled " a thick , unbound set of pages " dealing with policy issues which , he explained , he had previously called " useful " because it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Actually , Baker , though he talked about a " black hinder , " did say that he had " no recol  --  lection " of seeing or receiving " any debate strategy or sensitive debating points " prepared for Carter . Thus it is entirely possible that Casey , with  --  out giving the matter much thought , passed along to Baker some material that was not the final debate book pre  --  pared for Carter and recently released by Caddell but an earlier version of the final debate book . ( Casey , in his de  --  nial , said , " I can assure you that the campaign management never contem  --  plated , directed or authorized any ef  --  fort to obtain information of this kind nor , to my knowledge , did the cam  --  paign ever use or have the kind of information described in Mr. Barrett 's book . " ) According to some people at the White House , Casey and Baker discussed the letters they would be sending to the subcommittee , and it was clear that the disparity between their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither man was willing to budge . Then , on July 6th , the Times published a story based on an interview with Casey , who had dropped around to the Times Washington bureau to give his side of the story , apparently out of concern that his failure of recol  --  lection was n't going over well , and that he might be on the way to becom  --  ing a fall guy . And another explosion hit ' Washington . Casey 's denial had a certain porousness ( " It would be to  --  tally uncharacteristic and quite incred  --  ible that I would hand anybody a book I knew to be from the Carter cam  --  paign and say this might be helpful to the debate " ) , and his defenders later said the question was whether he " knowingly " passed along the papers , but what mesmerized Washington about the interview was that it ap  --  peared to be a declaration of war on Baker . " I would n't tolerate it , " Casey said of receiving any such papers . " I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , the debate team was " remiss " in not telling the campaign hierarchy about the papers . Baker , aware that he was in a big fight , made no further comment , but columnists known to be friendly to the respective parties carried on the feud on their behalf , and Washington sol  --  emnly weighed the statements the two men had made , and , like spectators at a coliseum , looked forward to what they assumed would be a fight to the finish . ( Along the way , the controversy ac  --  quired the name " Debategate , " which was unfortunate and inaccurate . The term began early as a nervous joke among some Carter people , at a time they themselves wondered whether the story would go anywhere . The suffix " gate " has been indiscriminately ap  --  plied to all manner of scandals and scandalettes since the great one of 1973-74 , whereas each is a thing unto itself , and of its own degree of impor  --  tance . ) Meanwhile , Stockman allowed that he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " papers , and it was reported that Stockman had bragged to a luncheon of the Optimist Club , in Cassopolis , Michigan , on the day of the debate that he had been helped in preparing Reagan for the debate by using a " pilfered copy of the briefing book he Carter was going to use , " and predicted what both candi  --  dates would say . The original story about what Stockman told the Opti  --  mist Club appeared on the day after the debate in a paper called the Elk  --  hart Truth  --  and was ignored until recently . When these new stories broke , Stockman was thereupon be  --  lieved to he in deep trouble , his pri  --  mary sin apparently being that he talks too much . He had survived in his job after his confessions of private doubts about the Reagan economic program had been published in The Atlantic in December , 1981 ? and after what was described at the time as a trip to the President 's " woodshed " ? but he was as if on probation . Stockman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infectious charm of the enthusias  --  tic wunderkind who never quite grew up . His has been a life of brilliance , and unsteadiness : the brightest boy wherever he went , who gained impor ? tant sponsors along the way , but never seemed rooted . He enthusiastically em  --  braced one totality after another . His course has taken him from a farm in St. Joseph , Michigan , to Michigan State , where he was involved in radical student politics during the Vietnam War ; to Harvard Divinity School , where he drifted toward " neo-conser  --  vative " politics and the social sciences ; to the staff of a liberal-to-moderate Republican congressman ( John An  --  derson ) ; to being elected , at twenty-nine , a Republican congressman from Michigan , who attracted attention al  --  most at once ; to becoming , at thirty-four , Reagan 's budget director and one of the most powerful people in the country . It is utterly in character that Stockman now says that he told the local leaders of Cassopolis ( pop . 2,000 ) ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the debate because he wanted to titil  --  late them and also wanted them to think that he was in the big time . Stockman tells people that he does not remember the episode but that if it was in the paper that he said these things he must have said them . And he tells people that it is regrettable that he used the word " pilfered , " because in fact he assumed that the material had been leaked by someone in the Carter White House . While Stockman has recently told people that " filched " was Barrett 's word , his own spokesman had confirmed earlier that Stockman used the word in talking to Barrett . Stockman also says that the reason he had called the material " useful " was that it was useful in the sense that he had interrupted his own campaigning for his House seat and had one day to prepare for the Reagan rehearsals , and that he did n't want to make a fool of himself before the Reagan high com  --  mand . But , he says , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There have been a number of contradictions by Reagan people about the nature of the domestic material they had . Whatever such material they did have has not been released . They are saying that they did not have  --  or do not recollect having  --  the final brief  --  ing book prepared for Carter , and Stockman sometimes refers to having a collection of papers , but the Elkhart Truth quotes him as saying that he had used a " pilfered copy of the brief  --  ing book he Carter was going to use . " And Baker did refer to a " black binder . " Maybe what Baker received in the " black binder " was then removed from it . Maybe what all this amounts to is a loose use of language ; maybe not . Sometimes Stockman says that what he had was Carter issue boiler  --  plate , but he has also said that he saw " Carter questions and answers " having to do with certain subjects  --  the econo  --  my , energy , the environment , and others . The Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy . Early in the contro  --  versy , Reagan told reporters , " I do n't think there ever was a briefing hook as such . " Frank Hodsoll , who also helped prepare Reagan for the debate , has said that he remembers seeing questions and answers . ( Hodsoll is now chairman of the National En  --  dowment for the Arts . ) Stockman says that the papers he used were probably tossed out by his congressional office . THE dispute over the briefing pa- pers deepened the schisms in an already divided Administration  --  more divided than any in memory , which is saying quite a hit  --  and outsiders who had already chosen up sides jumped on this new opportunity to rid the Ad  --  ministration of members of the un  --  wanted faction . The schisms within the Reagan White House were pecu  --  liarly deep because they ' were caused by factors that went well beyond the usual jockeying for position . In the case of the Reagan Administration , the jockeying for position is overlaid with ideological , political , and even cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixture that turns ordinary power plays into tong wars . The alignment within the Reagan White House is usually described as " prag  --  matists " versus either " ideologues " or , depending on who is assigning the labels , " true Reaganites . " But the categorizations blur things some  --  what . Counted among the pragma  --  tists are Baker ; Stockman ; Gergen ; Richard Darman , assistant to the President ; and Michael Deaver , deputy chief of staff . Counted among the ideologues are William Clark , the President 's national-security adviser ; Edwin Meese , counsellor to the Presi  --  dent ; and Casey . The categories are n't quite that neat , because Deaver has worked for Reagan in some capacity since 1966 , when he was brought into the Governor 's office in California by Clark . And Casey was a Nixon  --  Wall Street Republican . The pragmatists ( except for Deaver ) are seen by Rea  --  gan 's right-wing supporters as parve  --  nus who wo n't " let Reagan be Rea  --  gan " : who not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; who do not share Reagan 's ( and Clark 's ) hard-line-foreign-policy emphasis or his enthusiasm for the size of the mili  --  tary buildup that is under way . Speak  --  ing of Baker , one longtime Reagan man said to me recently , " Some of us feel that Jim 's too outspoken in talking to the press , that he pushes his own views , not the President 's view . And there was a feeling that sometimes Jim was up on the Hill making deals that were not the deals the President sent him up there to make . The old Reaganites who never played it that way feel this way . " Baker and Gergen had worked for the Presidential nomi  --  nation of George Bush ( Baker was Bush 's campaign manager , and before that had worked for Ford 's cam  --  paign ) , and , Bush 's faithfulness to Reagan notwithstanding , anyone con  --  nected with him is suspect in the eyes of the longtime Reaganites . This has to do with not just the present but the future : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not simply to help Reagan but with a view to helping Bush 's political future when the opportunity arises for him to make his own run for the Presidency again , against some candidate the far right would prefer . This is a very sus  --  picious bunch . Baker is cut out for at  --  tracting resentments : though new to the Reagan group , he maneuvered himself into the prime position in the White House staff ( at least until Clark came along ) ; he is a handsome , wealthy man , at home with the higher social circles of both his native Hous  --  ton and Washington . ( None of the other top Reagan aides has such a background . ) Baker is seen by the old Reaganites as using his savvy and his entree to further himself and his own views , and to obtain the protection that such entree brings from criticism of the Reagan Administration . This path is one that some members of every Administration try to take , and , while it has its perils , Baker has so far been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least some old Reagan  --  ites as a man who , as they see it , owes everything to his association with Reagan but fell under the spell of Baker , and was a bit too taken with Washington 's social glamour . Gergen had worked for Nixon and Ford , which makes anybody suspect to the old Reaganites and right-wingers ; and Darman , whom Baker brought into the White House , had , of all things , worked for Elliot Richardson . The true Reaganites had not spent all those years struggling to take over the Republican Party , and ultimately-the Presidency , in order to have their Administration taken over by " prag  --  matists . " Thus , as the battle heat  --  ed over the papers issue , Richard Viguerie , the New Right leader , who had often complained about the take  --  over of the Reagan Administration by " Wall Street and the Fortune 500 , " appeared on television to deplore the behavior of the group ( headed by Baker ) that had prepared Reagan for the debate . Others also took swipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served Reagan . Casey is perhaps the most interest  --  ing character in this whole brew . Be  --  cause he mumbles ( to the point where he is sometimes difficult to understand ) and has a shambling style , he is often underestimated . He is a very tough man and  --  as recent events prove  --  a formidable infighter . He has had an unusual career . He was a disciple of William ( Wild Bill ) Donovan , the head of the Office of Strategic Services ( the forerunner of the C.I.A. ) during the Second World War , and came away with the respect of his O.S.S. colleagues . He made a fortune as a lawyer and investor . When questions arose about possible connections be  --  tween the settlement by the Nixon Justice Department of an anti-trust case against I.T.T . and a commitment by I.T.T . to contribute four hundred thousand dollars to the 1972 Republi  --  can Convention , Casey , who was chairman of the Securities and Ex  --  change Commission , was alleged to have sent pertinent documents out of his office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would be protected from interested congres  --  sional committees . After Reagan named him director of the C.I.A. , Casey engendered some controversy for his failure to list many of his law clients and assets and liabilities on his disclosure form during Senate pro  --  ceedings on his confirmation . And he stirred up more dust by naming as the head of covert operations Max Hugel , a Runyonesque businessman who had worked in the 1980 Reagan campaign . Hugel , whose appointment shocked the old-line C.I.A . professionals , as well as outsiders who had nothing to do with the agency , eventually had to resign , over allegations of improper stock-trading practices . In the summer of 1981 , there was a brief furor over Casey , involving allegations of earlier financial misconduct and lingering ir  --  ritation over his appointment of Hu  --  gel , with the whole thing having the aura of a multilayered affair which events surrounding the C.I.A . usually do . Senators resentful of Casey 's bluff style , ex-C.I.A. ( and perhaps current C.I.A. ) operatives resentful of man  --  agement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various people disturbed by Casey 's role all got in on the act . Casey partisans came to his defense . After an investigation , the Senate In  --  telligence Committee in December re  --  ported that it had no basis for conclud  --  ing that Casey was " unfit to serve . " But he continued to make people un  --  easy . Recently , there was a smaller to-do over the Fact that Casey continued to manage his multimillion-dollar portfolio while sitting in a position that made him privy to highly sensi  --  tive , and perhaps financially useful , information . Other top government officials had voluntarily placed their holdings in blind trusts , and some Reagan officials were embarrassed by Casey 's refusal to do so . But Casey 's position on this matter was consistent with his " the hell with ' ern " attitude : he is a man who has done well in the world and does not choose to live by other men 's rules . ( A few days ago , under congressional pressure , Casey agreed to put his holdings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the way he had handled his finances , but that he was " tired of being hassled about it . " ) His manage  --  ment of the C.I.A . has been contro  --  versial in itself . According to a num  --  ber of people , he has retained the swashbuckling style of the Wild Bill Donovan do-something days , and is more inclined than several of his pre  --  decessors to use the instruments of the agency for covert purposes . Nor does he shrink from offering his policy views as well as his intelligence assess  --  ments ? " He is very outspoken , " says one Reagan adviser  --  and his policy views tend to place him with the very-hard-liners within the Reagan entou  --  rage . Many of the agency 's profession  --  als , and its alumni , find Casey 's poli  --  cymaking activity disturbing , because of the clouds it places on the intelli  --  gence information he offers . That Casey ended up within the circle of the conservative Californians around Reagan was not necessarily predictable . He comes from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it was Casey who was brought in to rescue the Reagan 1980 campaign for the nomination , on the day of the New Hampshire primary , in February , when Reagan dismissed John Sears as campaign manager because of internal feuds and because campaign funds had been overspent . " Casey came in and became part of the old team , " says Lyn Nofziger , who was White House direc  --  tor of political affairs in 1981 and then became a po  --  litical consultant . " Those were the old Reaganites in the primary days . " Casey 's relationship with Baker has been a rocky one . According to people who know both men , Casey began as a strong backer of Baker , and ended tip as his strong antagonist . Their relationship is a study of a collision between two tough , strong-willed men . People who have observed both men closely say that Casey is the tougher of the two . It was Casey who recruited Baker for the Rea  --  gan campaign  --  Baker had previously not been offered what he considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Houston . Casey put Baker in AUGUST 1 . 1983 charge of arrangements for whatever debates might occur , and , according to someone who knows them both , was a strong backer of his in the campaign and during the first year of the Ad  --  ministration . But then Casey grew suspicious of Baker , feeling that a number of actions Baker took were in the interest of his own political future , and that of George Bush . Matters were n't helped when rumors emanated from the White House from time to time that Baker might he named head of the C.I.A. ; the rumors were pre  --  sumed to come from Baker and his al  --  lies . ( The C.I.A . post was one of several positions " mentioned " for Baker , as a way of both advancing his career and removing him from the right wing 's line of fire . ) Gradually , Casey grew increasingly outspoken in his criticism of Baker within the Reagan circle . Richard Allen , whom Baker helped maneuver out of his job as Reagan 's national-security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  cepted watches , and an envelope con  --  taining a thousand dollars in cash from a Japanese magazine was found in his office safe  --  and who harbors deep resentments , is , according to mu  --  tual friends , very close to Casey . Then Baker insisted on telling the House subcommittee that he recalled receiv  --  ing the briefing papers from Casey . And after that there appeared in the Post a leak from the White House making fun of Casey 's mum  --  ble , his management of his portfolio ( one White House joke had it that C.I.A . really stood for " Casey Investing Again " ) , and his poor mem  --  ory about the briefing book . By this time , it was all-out war , with several people caught uncomfortably in the middle . The atmosphere at the White House has been tense throughout these events . One White House aide , in a eve ) conversation we had as the story was beginning to un fold , went on at some length , and with some vehemence , about what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives of the press . Another began a half-hour conversation with the statement that he did not want to talk about the briefing-papers controversy , and his next sentence was , " How long do you think this thing will go on ? " And most of that conversation was taken up with the subject . The matter has been a major source of distraction THE NEW YORNER at the White House ; it is the sort of thing that is clearly on the minds of the principal figures even when they are talking about something else . It is the sort of thing that makes it hard to govern . The President 's aides worried about his image , and about their heads . Early in the controversy , Reagan had said that the Justice Department would " monitor " the case , and shortly after that the Justice Department in  --  quiry became a criminal investigation . Then , just after the President seemed to disappear from sight  --  a develop  --  ment that worried his image-makers ? he theatrically strode into an early-morning staff meeting and ordered his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to neither camp believe that , whatever Reagan does about it  --  whether or not anyone is forced to resign --  the breach that the controversy has caused can not be healed . Some officials were at pains to indicate that their own skirts were clean , and indicated that if some of their brethren had to go ? well , that 's too bad , but that 's the way things are . THE possibility that there might have been an organized intelli  --  gence-gathering operation on the part of the Reagan campaign has not been dismissed by even some of the less melodramatic people here , because of a number of known factors and some facts that have come to light . At the least , various members of the Reagan campaign busied themselves trying to obtain information of a nature that does not normally pass from camp to camp . To some extent , these people may have been , as Reagan people now say , the flotsam and jetsam that are drawn to many campaigns and try to win points by playing up their discov  --  eries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a lot of this . It is possible that those who sought information did it of their own volition , and that a lot of information came in over the transom . But some  --  thing unusual was going on . The first sign of this was when , on June 28th , the White House released a number of documents that it said had come into the possession of the Reagan campaign . The Carter people were quick to point out that some of the documents were briefing material cov  --  ering foreign policy  --  preliminary ma  --  terial prepared for Carter 's debate with Reagan and also some for a possible Mondale debate with Bush  --  and they asserted that no single person could have had access to both this material and the domestic briefing book . They said that the foreign-policy material was held within the offices of the Na  --  tional Security Council staff . ( Some of the released material was found in the files of Gergen  --  under " Afghani  --  stan " ? who had at first written to the Albosta subcommittee that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " never studied nor drew upon any sensitive materials from the Carter camp . " He also said that he did not recall " seeing a ' Carter debate book ' or any other notebook from the Carter campaign . " ) Then it was reported in the Post that Richard Allen , Reagan 's principal foreign-policy adviser in the campaign , had received some of the daily memorandums that the Carter National Security Council staff mem  --  bers wrote to their boss , Zbignievv Brzezinski  --  documents that Allen de  --  scribed as " innocuous " and unclassi  --  fied , pertaining to such matters as staff morale . Allen also said that he had received only three of them . He said that they had come in over the tran  --  som . Why anyone would bother to send Allen three innocuous documents about N.S.C. staff morale is only one of the puzzles in this whole thing . ( Brzezinski and his deputy , David Aaron , have said that the daily memo  --  randums contained sensitive , substan  --  tive material . ) Allen 's behavior was of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was doing was simply settling scores . He went on ABC 's " Nightline " on the night of July 4th to confirm that he had re  --  ceived some excerpts from N.S.C. staff memorandums ( " I think it was proba  --  bly the most innocuous material that I had ever seen " ) and , while he was at it , to take some swipes at Baker . Allen said that he was aware of the existence of the briefing book but added , " I thought it would be , in the first in  --  stance , highly unethical to use it . " He said that " perhaps some of the people who had only recently come on board " the campaign  --  that is , Baker and Gergen ? " may have had some fear that they were working for someone who was n't competent on the issues . " Four nights later , Carl Bernstein re  --  ported on " Nightline " that William . Van Cleave , Reagan 's defense-policy adviser during the campaign , said that Allen had given him Carter briefing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allen denied this . Few were surprised when it was reported during that same week that Allen had named as the source of his documents Jerry Jennings , a former N.S.C. staff member in charge of security in the N.S.C. offices , who was , as it happens , the man who reported the discovery in Allen 's safe of the envelope containing cash . Jennings , who had worked for the C.I.A . and the F.B.I. , was on the National Security Council staff during the Nixon , Ford , Carter , and Reagan Presidencies and is currently executive director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy . Jen  --  nings ' job as N.S.C. security officer entailed , among other things , seeing to it that sensitive documents were safely locked away , and he would have had access to the staff members ' offices  --  and their safes . Jennings said that any suggestion that he was Allen 's source " is untrue and absolutely ludicrous . " Then , on July 9th , it was reported in the Post that Allen had said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the source of the mate  --  rial , but he could n't recall whom . ( Some journalists later wondered whether they had underplayed the Jennings story , because they had as  --  sumed Allen was simply getting even . ) By then , the Times had reported that Allen had received classified informa  --  tion . Someone who was in the Rea  --  gan campaign  --  and is presumably al  --  lied with Allen  --  said to me , " Dick had good contacts in the N.S.C. " The Times also reported that an in  --  telligence-gathering operation had been conducted by Stefan Halper , a researcher who had served on the Bush campaign and then worked in the Reagan campaign . Some former aides suggested that he was receiving informa  --  tion from the C.I.A . Halper later said that this was " preposterous . " Halper 's father-in-law , Ray Cline , who had been a deputy director of the C.I.A . and was an ad  --  viser to the Reagan cam  --  paign , responding to the Times on Halper 's be  --  half , said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a. " romantic fallacy . " By this time , all manner of hereto  --  fore unknown names were popping up , and we had to come to grips with a whole new cast of characters . In this respect , it did seem for a moment like the early Watergate days . On the day that the T1771C1 published its story about the supposed intelligence opera  --  tion , the Post published material from AUGUST 1,1983 the Carter White House found after the campaign , by a collector of memo  --  rabilia , in a dumpster outside the Rea  --  gan headquarters . The material was of no great consequence , but what at  --  tracted attention was that this showed that still more material had somehow changed hands , and that a campaign volunteer , in a covering note to Meese , Robert Gray ( a public-relations man who was deputy campaign manager for communications ) , and Casey , said the material had come from a " White House mole . " Perhaps some of the people in the Reagan campaign had read too much John le Carre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ply seeking the attention of the big shots . But there was another possibility . It was known that the Reagan campaign was obsessed with the possibility that Carter might , shortly before the elec tion , obtain the release of the hostages held in Iran . When Casey told a breakfast meeting of reporters at the Republican Convention , in Detroit , that the Reagan people thought there might be " an October surprise , " his suggestion just seemed like good poli tics : any successful move by Carter would be seen as having been man ipulated for the election . At the time , Casey used the term " intelligence operation " to describe the monitoring activity the campaign would conduct in order to anticipate the " surprise . " One Reagan person told roe recently that some of the campaign leaders saw the Cuban mis sile crisis of October , 1962 , just before that year 's con gressional elections , as a parallel for what Carter might do in October , 1980 . " They knew what hap pened on what day in October , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the con gressional elections were affected . " It had already been reported that one Rea gan campaign aide , Ad miral Robert Garrick ( Ret. ) , had or ganized a network of retired military officers to watch military bases for the movement of troops or transport planes . Garrick confirmed this . The disclosure was at once ludicrous and worrisome . When Carter attempted the rescue mission that failed , in April of 1980 , the ships and helicopters were already in the area . A former Carter foreign-policy official says that a vital requirement of that or any other rescue THE NEW YORKER mission was that it be carried out without any noticeable movement of troops or ships from the United States . He and others say that there were some contingency plans for another hostage-rescue attempt but that it was never seriously considered , because , among other things , the hostages had been dispersed from the American Embassy , where they had been held . Several people here think that the Garrick operation as described was so silly  --  a bunch of retired military offi  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might have been a cover for something else . And it was never clear what these people would do if they did spot some military movement  --  pick up an unsecured telephone and report it to the Reagan campaign ? Or what the Reagan campaign would do with such information . When I sug  --  gested to one Reagan official that even if Carter had mounted some new effort to rescue the hostages the Reagan campaign people could not have said anything until they saw how it turned out , and that there would have been plenty of time to prepare contingency statements , he replied , " But you 're be  --  ing logical . " When Casey went to the Titnes Washington bureau , he said , " The campaign had no intelligence organization as such . " He added , " Except the whole organization had their antennae out . " Allen said on " Nightline , " " I would say that even though we set up an operation de  --  signed to try to anticipate what might happen , particularly with regard to the so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Allen also said that the story about retired military officers watching military bases  --  which Garrick had confirmed ? was " preposterous . " Allen said , " I never heard anything of that sort . " A number of factors led sensible people here  --  people without conspira  --  torial minds  --  to consider the possibil  --  ity that something more serious than a loose collection of information gath  --  erers , some of them self-starting , was involved in the Reagan 1980 campaign . It was known during the primaries that several former C.I.A . employees had joined the campaign of Bush , who had served as C.I.A . direc  --  tor for a year , from January , 1976 , to January , 1977 . ( Other Bush campaign aides used to joke about the ex-C.I.A. people 's penchant for secrecy , and their concern about the fact that the campaign did n't use burn bags . ) Bush , who had served in the House and had been chairman of the Republican Na  --  tional Committee during Watergate , was the first such political figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  pointment made some people nervous , but he got good marks for the job he did there , and he was , according to one former C.I.A . official , one of the most popular directors . This official says , " When George was running for President , there was n't a person in the building who did n't support him . " The C.I.A . professionals had ample reason for being unhappy with Carter . The man he named as C.I.A . director , Stansfield Turner , an admiral whom Carter had admired when both men were at Annapolis , was , like Bush , one of the few C.I.A . directors who did n't come from the ranks ; but , unlike Bush , he was unpopular with them . Turner removed about six hundred people from their jobs in the area of covert operations : many of these people were placed in other positions , about two hundred of them retired , and a few were fired outright . This makes for a very unhappy network . Some of these people were what one for  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ones who run around and do things . " Moreover , Carter , in 1978 , issued a charter designed to put reins on the activities of the F.B.I . and the C.I.A . Many of the former C.I.A . people who helped out in the Bush campaign joined the Reagan-Bush campaign after the nomination . Among the people working with I Ialper was Robert Gambino , who had been the C.I.A . director of security , a position that gave him access to the files of people who had received high-level security clearances . ( Such files usually contain rumors as well as facts about people 's personal lives . ) When Gambino left the C.I.A . and immedi  --  ately joined the Bush campaign , some Carter White House people were con  --  cerned , but they concluded that there was nothing they could do about it . Halper has described what Gambino was doing for him as " grunt work , " such as monitoring the news media . It struck a number of people here as odd that such a formerly high-level person would be doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Washing  --  ton , and of politics , for networks of like-minded people in and out of the bureaucracy  --  people involved in the fields of poverty , education , agricul  --  ture , the military , or what have you  --  to share information and make com  --  mon cause . When this sort of thing involves the C.I.A. , however , it takes on a different aspect . And it is to be AUGUST I , 1983 remembered that Casey had old C.I.A . contacts . ( Ray Cline , Halper 's father-in-law , is active in the Association of Former Intelligence Officers , a group of retired C.I.A . officials which holds meetings to express its concerns about the C.I.A. ) Added to all that , according to some people here , was the anger on the part of several retired military officers and other strong sup  --  porters of the military at what they considered Carter 's " weakening " of America 's defenses . Therefore , these groups would have taken a great inter  --  est in seeing Carter defeated . What methods they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is already known , is still open to speculation . But the atmosphere in Washington was such that , at Fourth of July parties , people actually en  --  gaged in serious debate over the ques  --  tion of whether , if it developed that there had been an effort by the intelli  --  gence community and perhaps old mil  --  itary hands , using clandestine meth ods , to bring down Carter , the country would care . " T HERE were still other indica tions that , one way or another , sensitive information was flowing into the Reagan campaign , and that several Reagan campaign officials knew about it . Among the material released by the White House was a memorandum from Wayne Valis , a campaign volun teer who is now a public-relations man , to David Gergen , which Valis described as notes " based on a Carter debate staff brainstorming session ? middle level types  --  nothing spectacu lar , but interesting  --  from a source in timately connected to a Carter debate staff member . Reliable . " Ile added , " I gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is indeed not spectacular , but it is the sort of thing that is helpful . The apparent innuendo ( " intimately " ) in the Valis memorandum was only one of several things that set off waves of rumors and allegations about the sex lives of people who worked in the Carter White House and in the Rea gan campaign . Many people are part of the permanent White House ap parat  --  they stay when an Administra tion packs its bags . These people were natural suspects for the Carter people when this whole episode began , but then the Reagan people as well spread rumors about who had what sorts of personal relationships with whom  --  in part , it seems , to buttress their argument ment that all that happened was that a few documents , none of them important , were slipped to Reagan people by unhappy employees of the Carter White House . ( Valis told a reporter , " I have no knowledge of any Reagan aides sleeping with Carter women to get information . If anyone says I do , it 's preposterous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press that Carol Darr , the deputy counsel to the Carter cam  --  paign , had been told by a friend in the Reagan campaign , Charles Crawford , that the Reagan people had access to the debate briefing material and that therefore Reagan would win the debate . Miss Darr is reported to have told her boss , Tim Smith , who has said that he did nothing about the report because he found it " preposter  --  ous . " Crawford worked under Robert Gray in the campaign . The Reagan people have been sug  --  gesting that whatever material they received came from " disgruntled " em  --  ployees of the Carter White House , and perhaps this is at least to some extent the case . About twelve hundred people work in what is loosely referred to as " the White House " ? in the of  --  fices in the West Wing itself and in the Executive Office Building , next door . Most of these are the people who remain from Administration to Ad  --  ministration , and their loyalties are more to the institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hap  --  pens to be President , If the President is not a particularly considerate man , as Jimmy Carter was n't , they can become disgruntled . Some Democrats who went to work for the Carter White House also undoubtedly became dis  --  gruntled over policy ; some of them may well have favored the candidacy of Edward M. Kennedy . Moreover , dur  --  ing the Carter Administration there was a relatively easy flow of traffic between the Executive Office Build  --  ing and the West Wing ( though not to the most sensitive offices of the National Security Council staff ) . The Reagan Administration has shut off access of E.O.B. employees to the White Flouse . But whether whatever disgruntled people there might have been would have of their own volition spirited all these documents out and sent them over the transom to the Reagan campaign is in question . The fact is that it would not be very difficult to penetrate a White House if one put one 's mind to it . The ingrecli  --  ems are in place . A certain number of White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some will be former C.I.A . em  --  ployees . A certain number of sexual relationships  --  heterosexual and ho  --  mosexual  --  may exist between people who want information and people who are in a position to obtain it . C.I.A . agents are known to penetrate gov  --  ernments all over the world : getting information out of a White House would be no great trick for them . So there are three possibilities : that what  --  ever material from the Carter White House landed in the Reagan cam  --  paign 's hands was voluntarily sent over the transom ; that various people in and around the Reagan campaign made it their business , on their own , to obtain such material ; that there was an organized effort to obtain the material . When the Times printed a sugges  --  tion , which was presumed to have come from Casey , that a longtime Kennedy retainer named Paul Corbin might have had something to do with the transfer of the briefing papers , a number of people assumed that this was an attempt on Casey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suggest a Kennedy tie-in to the whole episode . Corbin is a diminutive man with a wizened face and a gravel voice and a fanatic loyalty to the Kennedy family : he helped John Kennedy win the Wisconsin primary in 1960 , and worked in the Justice Department for Robert Kennedy and on the Robert Kennedy campaign of 1968 . ( Corbin is known among the Kennedy follow  --  ers as a trickster : an associate of the Kennedy family once told an inter  --  viewer , with reference to the Wiscon  --  sin primary , " If you have a job and you want to get it done , and you do n't care how it 's done , send Paul Corbin out to do it  --  but just understand you can never send him back to the same district . " ) Corbin hung around the Kennedy entourage , but few people seemed to have much idea of what he really did . ( Edward Kennedy appeared to be uneasy about him , and Corbin seemed to play almost no role in Ed  --  ward Kennedy 's 1980 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it delicately , of strong feelings , and anyone who did not share his fanaticism toward Robert Kennedy was suspect ( even those loyal to Robert Kennedy were often targets of Corbin 's wrath ) . Somewhere along the way , Corbin decided to help Rea  --  gan get elected , and at this point Corbin says that all he did was provide Casey with some speech material on crime written by Adam Walinsky , a former aide to Robert Kennedy who was then chairman of the New York State Commission of Investigation and supported Lewis Lehrman in his New York gubernatorial race . But Corbin 's role remains a matter of interest . Another line of argument by the White House was that journalists , who print leaks , and even stolen docu  --  ments , including the Pentagon Papers , were hypocritical to make a fuss over the briefing papers and other doc  --  uments that made their way from the Carter White House to the Reagan camp . But there were differences : Daniel Ellsherg was tried for his theft of the Pentagon Papers , and the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Nixon White House had raided his psychia  --  trist 's office ; and the right of the Post and the Times to publish the Pentagon Papers was upheld by the Supreme Court . There was another difference ( which White House offi  --  cials did concede when it was sug  --  gested to them ) : When a journalist publishes a leak , or information from a leaked document ( never mind that many of these leaks are provided by government , even White House , offi  --  cials ) , the reader knows that he is reading a leak . ( The story says some  --  thing like " Documents obtained from government officials say ... " ) But the public had no way of knowing that potentially sensitive information had been obtained by the Reagan camp , and that potentially helpful informa  --  tion had been used in preparation for the debate . THE inescapable conclusion as of now is that something out of the ordinary occurred in the 1980 cam  --  paign . And too much appears to have happened to lay it all at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in the Reagan campaign too eager to obtain informa  --  tion for whatever reason  --  and pre  --  pared to use it . All of the Reagan people insist that Reagan knew noth  --  ing about the obtaining of material from the Carter White House . They also insist that the material that came in was of no great value  --  but not , it seems , for want of trying . At this point , we do n't really know what was AUGUST 1 , 1983 obtained . Perhaps a lot of people were simply playing soldier . It is apparent that several high-level people knew that material was coming in . One puz  --  zle is why they did n't act on what Casey said to the Times he would have acted on : a suspicion that they were being set up  --  that the material was inaccurate , or that someone would expose them as having it . " It could have destroyed the campaign , " Casey said , in explaining why he would n't " touch it with a ten-foot pole . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might do something about the hostages . It is clear that there was within the Reagan campaign a pattern and practice of obtaining sensitive information from within the White House . Perhaps all this activity amounts to separate peb  --  bles ; perhaps it forms a mosaic . In any event , as far as is known , this sort of activity does not represent , as some suggest , " politics as usual . " Of course there have been " dirty tricks " before , and , especially in the pre-Watergate days , some high-handed activities on the part of Administrations  --  but that was then . As of now , there is no sign that anything quite like this has oc  --  curred before . ( And if it has , should that make any difference ? ) There are in fact a large number of unwritten rules governing political campaigns  --  lines that , it is understood , should not be crossed ; anything does n't go . More  --  over , differences in degree at some point become differences in kind . The only real question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By mid-July , the frenzy surround  --  ing the story had subsided , and Wash  --  ington calmed down . Journalistic fashion turned away from the story ? but not completely . Now that the F.B.I . investigation was under way , it was assumed that it might be some time before there would be any big breaks , if , indeed , there were any more breaks . Some people assumed that more documents would come to light . There were various theories about why House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill was negative about Albosta 's proceeding with the issue : some thought O'Neill had doubts about Al  --  bosta 's ability to handle the case ( Al  --  bosta had spoken out of turn on occa  --  sion ) , others took O'Neill at his word that he did n't consider it good politics ( the Democrats should continue to harp on the economy and " fairness ; " the issue might fizzle , leaving the Democrats empty-handed , or Reagan might fire someone and be considered a hero ) ; some had other theories . O'Neill did say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  vestigation it should he conducted by the Judiciary Committee , and Rodi  --  no 's staff was in fact now monitoring events . The Carter people fretted that unless people were put under oath the truth might not come out , and they ar  --  gued that a special prosecutor should be appointed . More dispassionate ob  --  servers suggested that only by having a special prosecutor appointed could the Reagan Administration make a con  --  vincing case that it had indeed got to the bottom of it . A number of people were aware that the story still had a lot of loose threads , some of which might unravel quite a lot . A few peo  --  ple were following those threads . Others went off on their vacations. - ELIZABETH DREW
