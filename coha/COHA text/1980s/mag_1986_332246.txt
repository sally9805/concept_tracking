Over the years , either the United States or the Soviet Union has served as the No. 1 arms dealer to the Third World . But last year , according to a newly released report by the U.S. Congressional Research Service , both super- powers were edged out by Western Europe . <P> Despite a slight slump in overall arms sales in 1985 , Britain , France , West Germany and Italy together sold $9.37 billion in weapons to Third World countries , principally to the Middle East . Western Europe thus accounted for 31.3% of this arms trade , in contrast to 30.4% for the Soviet Union and 17.8% for the U.S.
