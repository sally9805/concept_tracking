Composite of versions published in CN and ND zones . One of the things I like best about the Commodore Amiga is that you can run it like either a Macintosh or an IBM PC . Using the Workbench , you can copy diskettes , view files and load programs by pointing and clicking with the mouse , just as you do on the Mac . The Command Line Interface ( CLI ) , on the other hand , lets you type commands at the keyboard in response to a prompt , very much like the DOS prompt on an IBM PC . Unfortunately , most users begin and end with the Workbench , and for good reason . The Amiga User ' s Manual hardly mentions the CLI option . Those clever enough to activate the CLI pretty much have to guess at the Disk Operating System ( DOS ) commands that can make the computer perform . Too bad that the most commonly used commands are just different enough from their IBM PC-DOS counterparts to make the experience a lesson in frustration . Actually , Commodore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published by Bantam and costs $24. 95 . It ought to have been bundled in free with the Amiga itself . Nonetheless , anyone who wants to go beyond the Workbench should consider spending the extra money . Even if you don ' t use the CLI often , the AmigaDOS Manual will broaden and deepen your understanding of Amiga operations . The manual is available in a second edition , to go along with the recent release of AmigaDOS version 1. 2 . In addition to information on using the Command Line Interface , the AmigaDOS Manual also contains two sections of technical information for programming the Amiga . Naturally there also is information about the changes made in the latest version of AmigaDOS . If you haven ' t yet upgraded to the new system software , you ought to . The upgrade is only $14 and includes new Kickstart , Workbench and Extras Diskettes . Several major bugs have been squashed and a number of features added . The Notepad , for example , now allows word wrap at the end of a line as well as block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for four more printers : the Apple ImageWriter II and the Okidata 92 , 192 and 193 . Another good reason to upgrade is that some of the newer Amiga programs , such as the utility program Zing and the latest version of the word processor Scribble ! , either require or recommend the use of AmigaDOS version 1. 2 . On the other hand , be forewarned that you may experience problems with older programs and the new operating system . In particular , Seven Cities of Gold , Deluxe Video and Music Studio have been identified by Commodore as incompatible with version 1. 2 . For more information or to get your upgrade , contact your local Commodore dealer . ADVENTURE GAMES When the Commodore Amiga debuted nearly a year ago , software to show off its dazzling graphics was rather rare . There were a few graphics adventures from Activision and a handful of joystick games from Electronic Arts . But lately , more and more Amiga titles have been showing up at my door , and while you still can ' t have it all with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Late last year Electronic Arts introduced excellent versions of the popular arcade game Marble Madness and my all-time favorite role-playing adventure , Ultima III . Now Electronic Arts is distributing five of Sierra Software ' s most popular games in Amiga format : Space Quest , Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Wood and all three Kings Quest titles . Space Quest is an animated adventure set in the distant future . Winnie the Pooh is a graphic adventure designed for children age 7 and older . The King ' s Quest trilogy has been popular with game players of all ages . Space Quest and each title in the King ' s Quest trilogy are priced at $49. 95 . Winnie the Pooh is $24. 95 . More information is available from Electronic Arts , 415-571-7171 . Also new for the Amiga is Sinbad and the Throne of the Falcon , from Mindscape . This is the fourth title in the Cinemaware series , and it looks to be one of the better offerings . I still like the gangster comedy King of Chicago better , but Sinbad beats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow-up . S.D.I. is just a little too demanding , while Defender is just too easy . ( In fairness , I should point out that Defender has stunning graphics . ) Sinbad , on the other hand , offers plenty of challenge , but it gives you some slack as you enter the game and come to terms with its requirements . Naturally , you play the role of Sinbad , and naturally you must save the day by roaming the high seas in search of adventure . Like the other Cinemaware games , this one offers a combination of adventure , strategy and video arcade action , with the emphasis on adventure . Sinbad and the Throne of the Falcon is priced at $49. 95 . More information is available from Mindscape in the Chicago area at 480-7667 . Have a question about home computing ?
