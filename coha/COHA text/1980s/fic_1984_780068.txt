 | " Do n't worry , kiddo , " grinned her uncle , " I 'll bring you the bad fella 's hide if he do n't get me first . " Alton Drew walked up the path toward the wood , thinking about Babe . She was a phenomenon  --  a pampered farm child . Ah well  --  she had to be . They 'd both loved Clissa Drew , and she 'd married Cory , and they had to love Clissa 's child . Funny thing , love . Alton was a man 's man , and thought things out that way ; and his reaction to love was a strong and frightened one . He knew what love was because he felt it still for his brother 's wife and would feel it as long as he lived for Babe . It led him through his life , and yet he embarrassed himself by thinking of it . Loving a dog was an easy thing , because you and the old devil could love one another completely without talking about it . The smell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for Alton Drew , a grunt of satisfaction and the scream of something hunted and hit were poetry enough . They were n't like love for a human , that choked his throat so he could not say words he could not have thought of anyway . So Alton loved his dog Kimbo and his Winchester for all to see , and let his love for his brother 's women , Clissa and Babe , eat at him quietly and unmentioned . His quick eyes saw the fresh indentations in the soft earth behind the boulder , which showed where Kimbo had turned and leaped with a single surge , chasing the rabbit . Ignoring the tracks , he looked for the nearest place where a rabbit might hide , and strolled over to the stump . Kimbo had been there , he saw , and had been there too late . " You 're an of fool , " muttered Alton . " Y ' ca n't catch a cony by chasin ' it . You want to cross him up some way . " He gave a peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some nearby stump for a rabbit that was three counties away by now . No answer . A little puzzled , Alton went back to the path . " He never done this before , " he said softly . He cocked his .32-40 and cradled it . At the county fair someone had once said of Alton Drew that he could shoot at a handful of corn and peas thrown in the air and hit only the corn . Once he split a bullet on the blade of a knife and put two candles out . He had no need to fear anything that could be shot at . That 's what he believed . The thing in the woods looked curiously down at what it had done to Kimbo , and tried to moan the way Kimbo had before he died . It stood a minute storing away facts in its foul , unemotional mind . Blood was warm . The sunlight was warm . Things that moved and bore fur had a muscle to force the thick liquid through tiny tubes in their bodies . The liquid coagulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thinner and the loss of a limb slid not mean loss of lik . It was very interesting , but the thing , the mold with a mind  | was not pleased . Neither was it displeased . Its accidental urge was a thirst for knowledge , and it was only  --  interested . It was growing late , and the sun reddened and rested awhile on the hilly horizon , teaching the clouds to be inverted flames . The thing threw up its head suddenly , noticing the dusk . Night was ever a strange thing , even for those of us who have known it in life . It would have been frightening for the monster had it been capable of fright , but it could only be curious ; it could only reason from what it had observed . What was happening ? It was getting harder to see . Why ? It threw its shapeless head from side to side . It was true  --  things were dim , and growing dimmer . Things were changing shape , taking on a new and darker color . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ? How did they see ? The larger one , the one that had attacked , had used two organs in its head . That must have been it , because after the thing had torn off two of the dog 's legs it had struck at the hairy muzzle ; and the dog , seeing the blow coming , had dropped folds of skin over the organs  --  closed its eyes . Ergo , the dog saw with its eyes . But then after the dog was dead , and its body still , repeated blows had had no effect on the eyes . They remained open and staring . The logical conclusion was , then , that a being that had ceased to live and breathe and move about lost the use of its eyes . It must be that to lose sight was , conversely , to die . Dead things did not walk about . They lay down and did not move . Therefore the thing in the wood concluded that it must be dead , and so it lay down by the path , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and believed itself dead . Alton Drew came up through the dusk to the wood . He was frankly worried . He whistled again , and then called , and there was still no response , and he said again , " The of flea-bus never done this before , " and shook his heavy head . It was past milking time , and Cory would need him . " Kimbo ! " he roared . The cry echoed through the shadows , and Alton flipped on the safety catch of his rifle and put the butt on the ground beside the path . Leaning on it , he took off his cap and scratched the back of his head , wondering . The rifle butt sank into what he thought was soft earth ; he staggered and stepped into the chest of the thing that lay beside the path . His foot went up to the ankle in its yielding rottenness , and he swore and jumped back . " Whew ! Somp'n sure dead as hell there ! Ugh ! " He swabbed at his boot with a handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the edges of the deep footprint in its chest sliding into it , filling it up . It lay there regarding him dimly out of its muddy eyes , thinking it was dead because of the darkness , watching the articulation of Alton I ) rew 's joints , wondering at this o ( ? um autiour creature ,  | Alton cleaned the butt of his gun with more leaves and went on up the path , whistling anxiously for Kimbo . Clissa Drew stood in the door of the milk shed , very lovely in red-checked gingham and a blue apron . Her hair was clean , yellow , parted in the middle and stretched tautly back to a heavy braided knot . " Cory ! Alton ! " she called a little sharply . " Well ? " Cory responded gruffly from the barn , where he was stripping off the Ayrshire . The dwindling streams of milk plopped pleasantly into the froth of a full pail . " I 've called and called , " said Clissa . " Supper 's cold , and Babe wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Cory grunted , heaved the stool out of the way , threw over the stanchion lock and slapped the Ayrshire on the rump . The cow backed and filled like a towboat , clattered down the line and out into the barn-yard . " Ai n't back yet . " " Not back ? " Clissa came in and stood beside him as he sat by the next cow , put his forehead against the warm flank . " But , Cory , he said he 'd ? " " Yeh , yeh , I know . He said he 'd be back for the milkin ' . I heard him . Well , he ai n't . " " And you have to ? Oh , Cory , I 'll help you finish up . Alton would be back if he could . Maybe he 's ? " " Maybe he 's treed a blue jay , " snapped her husband . " Him an ' that damn dog , " He gestured hugely with one hand while the other went on milking . " I got twenty-six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feed an ' chickens to put to bed . I got to toss hay for the mare and turn the team out . I got harness to mend and a wire down in the night pasture . I got wood to split an ' carry . " He milked for a moment in silence , chewing on his lip . Clissa stood twisting her hands together , trying to think of something to stem the tide . It was n't the first time Alton 's hunting had interfered with the chores . " So I got to go ahead with it . I ca n't interfere with Alton 's spoorin ' . Every damn time that hound o ' his smells out a squirrel I go without my supper . I 'm gettin ' sick and ? " " Oh , I 'll help you ! " said Clissa . She was thinking of the spring when Kimbo had held four hundred pounds of ragging black bear at bay until Alton could put a bullet in its brain , the time Babe had found a bearcub and started to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting her head . You ca n't hate a dog that has saved your child for you , she thought . " You 'll do nothin ' of the kind ! " Cory growled . " Get back to the house . You 'll find work enough there . I 'll be along when I can . Dammit , Clissa , do n't cry ! I did n't mean to  --  Oh , shucks ! " He got up and put his arms around her . " I 'm wrought up , " he said . " Go on now . I 'd no call to speak that way to you . I 'm sorry . Go back to Bahr . I 'll put a atop to this for ** tonight . I 've had  | enough . There 's work here for four farmers an ' all we 've got is me an ' that .. . that huntsman . " Go on now , Clissa . " " All right , " she said into his shoulder . " But , Cory , hear him out first when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He might be unable to come back this time . Maybe he . . . he ? " " Ai n't nothin ' kin hurt my brother that a bullet will hit . He can take care of himself . He 's got no excuse good enough this time . Go on , now . Make the kid eat . " Clissa went back to the house , her young face furrowed . If Cory quarreled with Alton now and drove him away , what with the drought and the creamery about to close and all , they just could n't manage . Hiring a man was out of the question . Cory 'd have to work himself to death , and he just would n't be able to make it . No one man could . She sighed and went into the house . It was seven o'clock , and the milking not done yet . Oh , why did Alton have to Babe was in bed at nine when Clissa heard Cory in the shed , slinging the wire cutters into a corner . " Alton back yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the kitchen ; and as she shook her head he clumped over to the stove , and lifting a lid , spat into the coals . " Come to bed , " he said . She laid down her stitching and looked at his broad back . He was twentyeight , and he walked and acted like a man ten years older , and looked like a man five years younger . " I 'll be up in a while , " Clissa said . Cory glanced at the corner behind the wood box where Alton 's rifle usually stood , then made an unspellable , disgusted sound and sat down to take off his heavy muddy shoes . " It 's after nine , " Clissa volunteered timidly . Cory said nothing , reaching for house slippers . " Cory , you 're not going to ? " " Not going to what ? " " Oh , nothing . I just thought that maybe Alton ? " " Alton , " Cory flared . " The dog goes hunting field mice . Alton goes hunting the dog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what you want ? " " I just  --  He was never this late before . " " I wo n't do it ! Go out lookin ' for him at nine o'clock in the night ? I 'll be damned ! He has no call to use us so , Clissa . " Clissa said nothing . She went to the stove , peered into the wash boiler set aside at the hack of the range . When she turned around , Cory had his shoes and coat on again . " I knew you 'd go , " she said . I ler voice smiled though she did not . " I 'll he hack Burned soon , " said Cory . " I do n't reckon he 's strayed far . It is late . I ai n't bared ** him , but ? " He hrokr his I2-gauge shotgun , looked  | through the barrels , slipped two shells in the breech and a box of them into his pocket . " Do n't wait up , " he said over his shoulder as he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the closed door , and went back to her stitching by the lamp . The path up the slope to the wood was very dark when Cory went up it , peering and calling . The air was chill and quiet , and a fetid odor of mold hung in it . Cory blew the taste of it out through impatient nostrils , drew it in again with the next breath , and swore . " Nonsense , " he muttered . " Houn ' dawg . Huntin ' , at ten in th ' night , too . Alton ! " he bellowed . " Alton Drew ! " Echoes answered him , and he entered the wood . The huddled thing he passed in the dark heard him and felt the vibrations of his footsteps and did not move because it thought it was dead . Cory strode on , looking around and ahead and not down since his feet knew the path . " Alton ! " " That you , Cory ? " Cory Drew froze . That corner of the wood was thickly set and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard was choked , quiet , penetrating . " Alton ? " " I found Kimbo , Cory . " " Where the hell have you been ? " shouted Cory furiously . He disliked this pitch-darkness ; he was afraid at the tense hopelessness of Alton 's voice , and he mistrusted his ability to stay angry at his brother . " I called him , Cory . I whistled at him , an ' the of devil did n't answer . " " I can say the same for you , you ... you louse . Why were n't you to milkin ' ? Where are you ? You caught in a trap ? " " The houn ' never missed answerin ' me before , you know , " said the tight , monotonous voice from the darkness . " Alton ! What the devil 's the matter with you ? What do I care if your mutt did n't answer ? Where ? " " I guess because he ai n't never died before , " said Alton , refusing to be interrupted . " You what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Alton , you turned crazy ? What 's that you say ? " " Kimbo 's dead . " " Kim . . . oh ! Oh ! " Cory was seeing that picture again in his mind ? Babe sprawled unconscious in the freshet , and Kimbo raging and snapping against a monster hear , holding her hack until Alton could get there . " What happened , Alton ? " he asked more quietly . " 1 aim to find out . Someone tore him up . " " lore him up ? "  | " There ai n't a bit of him left tacked together , Cory . Every damn joint in his body tore apart . Guts out of him . " " Good God ! Bear , you reckon ? " " No bear , nor nothin ' on four legs . He 's all here . None of him 's been et . Whoever done it just killed him an ' ? tore him up . " " Good God ! " Cory said again . " Who could 've ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' long home , " he said almost gently . " There 's no call for you to set up by him all night . " " I 'll set . I aim to be here at sunup , an ' I 'm going to start trackin ' , an ' I 'm goin ' to keep trackin ' till I find the one done this job on Kimbo . " " You 're drunk or crazy , Alton . " " I ai n't drunk . You can think what you like about the rest of it . I 'm stickin ' here . " " We got a farm back yonder . Remember ? I ai n't going to milk twenty-six head o ' cows again in the mornin ' like I did jest now , Alton . " " Somebody 's got to . I ca n't be there . I guess you 'll just have to , Cory . " " You dirty scum ! " Cory screamed . " You 'll come back with me now or I 'll know why ! " Alton 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come no nearer , bud . " Cory kept moving toward Alton 's voice . " I said " ? the voice was very quiet now ? " stop where you are . " Cory kept coming . A sharp click told of the release of the .32-40 's safety . Cory stopped . " You got your gun on me , Alton ? " Cory whispered . " Thass right , bud . You ai n't a-trompin ' up these tracks for me . I need ' em at sunup . " A full minute passed , and the only sound in the blackness was that of Cory 's pained breathing . Finally : " I got my gun , too , Alton . Come home . " " You ca n't see to shoot me . " " We 're even on that . " " We ai n't . I know just where you stand , Cory . I been here four hours . " " My gun scatters . " " My gun kills . " Without another word Cory Drew turned on his heel and stamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay in the blackness , not alive , not understanding death , believing itself dead . Things that were alive saw and moved about . Things that were not alive could do neither . It rested its muddy gaze on the line of trees at the crest of the rise , and deep within it thoughts trickled wetly . It lav huddled , dividing its newfound facts , dissecting them as it had dissected Ike things when there was light , comparing , concluding , pigeonholing.  | The trees at the top of the slope could just be seen , as their trunks were a fraction of a shade lighter than the dark sky behind them . At length they , too , disappeared , and for a moment sky and trees were a monotone . The thing knew it was dead now , and like many a being before it , it wondered how long it must stay like this . And then the sky beyond the trees grew a little lighter . That was a manifestly impossible occurrence , thought the thing , but it could see it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That was curious . What about dismembered dead things ? It would wait and see . The sun came hand over hand up a beam of light . A bird somewhere made a high yawning peep , and as an owl killed a shrew , a skunk pounced on another , so that the night shift deaths and those of the day could go on without cessation . Two flowers nodded archly to each other , comparing their pretty clothes . A dragonfly nymph decided it was tired of looking serious and cracked its back open , to crawl out and dry gauzily . The first golden ray sheared down between the trees , through the grasses , passed over the mass in the shadowed bushes . " I am alive again , " thought the thing that could not possibly live . " I am alive , for I see clearly . " It stood up on its thick legs , up into the golden glow . In a little while the wet flakes that had grown during the night dried in the sun , and when it took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shower of them fell away . It walked up the slope to find Kimbo , to see if he , too , were alive again . Babe let the sun come into her room by opening her eyes . Uncle Alton was gone  --  that was the first thing that ran through her head . Dad had come home last night and had shouted at mother for an hour . Alton was plumb crazy . He 'd turned a gun on his own brother . If Alton ever came ten feet into Cory 's land , Cory would fill him so full of holes , he 'd look like a tumbleweed . Alton was lazy , shiftless , selfish , and one or two other things of questionable taste but undoubted vividness . Babe knew her father . Uncle Alton would never be safe in this county . She bounced out of bed in the enviable way of the very young , and ran to the window . Cory was trudging down to the night pasture with two bridles over his arm , to get the team . There were kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washbowl and shook off the water like a terrier before she toweled . Trailing clean shirt and dungarees , she went to the head of the stairs , slid into the shirt , and began her morning ritual with the trousers . One step down was a step through the right leg . One more , and she was into the left . Then , bouncing step by step on both feet , buttoning one button per step , she reached the bottom fully dressed and ran into the kitchen . " Did n't Uncle Alton come back a-tall , Mum ? " " Morning , Babe . No , dear . " Clissa was too quiet , smiling too much , Babe thought shrewdly . Was n't happy . " Where 'd he go , Mum ? "  | " We do n't know , Babe . Sit down and eat your breakfast . " " What 's misbegotten , Mum ? " Babe asked suddenly . Her mother nearly dropped the dish she was drying . " Babe ! You must never say that again ! " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why is he what ? " Babe 's mouth muscled around an outsize spoonful of oatmeal . " A misbe ? " " Babe ! " " All right , Mum , " said Babe with her mouth full . " Well , why ? " " I told Cory not to shout last night , " Clisssa said half to herself . " Well , whatever it means , he is n't , " said Babe with finality . " Did he go hunting again ? " " He went to look for Kimbo , darling . " " Kimbo ? Oh Mummy , is Kimbo gone , too ? Did n't he come back either ? " " No dear . Oh , please , Babe , stop asking questions ! " " All right . Where do you think they went ? " " Into the north woods . Be quiet . " Babe gulped away at her breakfast . An idea struck her ; and as she thought of it she ate slower and slower , and cast more and more glances at her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be awful if daddy did anything to Uncle Alton . Someone ought to warn him . Babe was halfway to the woods when Alton 's .32-40 sent echoes giggling up and down the valley . Cory was in the south thirty , riding a cultivator and cussing at the team of grays when he heard the gun . " Hoa , " he called to the horses , and sat a moment to listen to the sound . " One-two-three . Four , " he counted . " Saw someone , blasted away at him . Had a chance to take aim and give him another , careful . My God ! " He threw up the cultivator points and steered the team into the shade of three oaks . He hobbled the gelding with swift tosses of a spare strap , and headed for the woods . " Alton a killer , " he murmured , and doubled back to the house for his gun . Clissa was standing just outside the door . " Get shells ! " he snapped and flung into the house . Clissa followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could get a box off the shelf . " Cory " Hear that gun , did you ? Alton 's off his nut . He do n't waste lead . He shot at someone just then , and he was n't fixin ' to shoot pa'tridges when I saw him last . lle was out to get a man . Gimmie my gun . " " Cory , Babe ? " " You keep her here . Oh , God , this is a helluva mess . I ca n't stand much more . " Cory ran out the dcxor . Clissa caught his arm : " Cory I 'm trying to tell you . Babe is n't here . I 've ailed , and she is n't here . "  | Cory 's heavy , young-old face tautened . " Babe  --  Where did you last see her ? " " Breakfast . " Clissa was crying now . " She say where she was going ? " " No . She asked a lot of questions about Alton and where he 'd gone . " " Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded , biting the back of her hand . " You should n't ha ' done that , Clissa , " he gritted , and ran toward the woods , Clissa looking after him , and in that moment she could have killed herself . Cory ran with his head up , straining with his legs and lungs and eyes at the long path . He puffed up the slope to the woods , agonized for breath after the forty-five minutes ' heavy going . He could n't even notice the damp smell of mold in the air . He caught a movement in a thicket to his right , and dropped . Struggling to keep his breath , he crept forward until he could see clearly .. There was something in there , all right . Something black , keeping still . Cory relaxed his legs and torso completely to make it easier for his heart to pump some strength back into them , and slowly raised the 12-gauge until it bore on the thing hidden in the thicket . " Come out ! " Cory said when he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God I 'll shoot ! " rasped Cory . There was a long moment of silence , and his finger tightened on the trigger . " You asked for it , " he said , and as he fired , the thing leaped sideways into the open , screaming . It was a thin little man dressed in sepulchral black , and bearing the rosiest baby-face Cory had ever seen . The face was twisted with fright and pain . The man scrambled to his feet and hopped up and down saying over and over , " Oh , my hand . Do n't shoot again ! Oh , my hand . Do n't shoot again ! " He stopped after a bit , when Cory had climbed to his feet , and he regarded the farmer out of sad china-blue eyes . " You shot me , " he said reproachfully , holding up a little bloody hand . " Oh , my goodness . " Cory said , " Now , who the hell are you ? " The man immediately became hysterical , mouthing such a flood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gun in self-defense . It seemed to consist mostly of " I lost my papers , " and " I did n't do it , " and " It was horrible . Horrible . Horrible , " and " The dead man , " and " Oh , do n't shoot again . " Cory tried twice to ask him a question , and then he stepped over and knocked the man down . lie lay on the ground writhing and moaning and blubbering and putting his bloody hand to his mouth where ( ' ory had hit him . " Now what 's going on around here ? " ' Ilse man rolled over and sat up . " I did n't do it ! " he sobbed . " I did n't . I waa  | walking along and I heard the gun and I heard some swearing and an awful scream and I went over there and peeped and I saw the dead man and I ran away and you came and I hid and you shot me and ? " " Shut up ! " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now , " said Cory , pointing along the path , " you say there 's a dead man up there ? " The man nodded and began crying in earnest . Cory helped him up . " Follow this path back to my farmhouse , " he said . " Tell my wife to fix up your hand . Do n't tell her anything else . And wait there until I come . Hear ? " " Yes . Thank you . Oh , thank you . Snff . " " Go on now . " Cory gave him a gentle shove in the right direction and went alone , in cold fear , up the path to the spot where he had found Alton the night before . He found him there now , too , and Kimbo . Kimbo and Alton had spent several years together in the deepest friendship ; they had hunted and fought and slept together , and the lives they owed each other were finished now . They were dead together . It was terrible that they died the same way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fainted dead away when he saw what the thing of the mold had done to his brother and his brother 's dog . The little man in black hurried down the path , whimpering and holding his injured hand as if he rather wished he could limp with it . After a while the whimper faded away , and the hurried stride changed to a walk as the gibbering terror of the last hour receded . He drew two deep breaths , said : " My goodness ! " and felt almost normal . He bound a linen handkerchief around his wrist , but the hand kept bleeding . He tried the elbow , and that made it hurt . So he stuffed the handkerchief back in his pocket and simply waved the hand stupidly in the air until the blood clotted . He did not see the great moist horror that clumped along behind him , although his nostrils crinkled with its foulness . The monster had three holes close together on its chest , and one hole in the middle of its slimy forehead . It had three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its head . These marks were where Alton Drew 's bullets had struck and passed through . Half of the monster 's shapeless face was sloughed away , and there was a deep indentation on its shoulder . This was what Alton Drew 's gun butt had done after he clubbed it and struck at the thing that would not lie down after he put his four bullets through it . When these things happened the monster was not hurt or angry . It only wondered why Alton Drew acted that way . Now it followed the little man without hurrying at all , matching his stride step by step and dropping little particles of muck behind it . The little man went on out of the wood and stood with his back against a big tree at the lirrest 's edge , and he thought . Enough had happened to him here What good would it do to stay and face a horrible murder inquest , just to continue this silly , vague search ? There was supposed to be the ruin of an old ,  | old hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would hold the evidence he wanted . But it was a vague report  --  vague enough to be forgotten without regret . It would be the height of foolishness to stay for all the hicktown red tape that would follow that ghastly affair back in the wood . Ergo , it would be ridiculous to follow that farmer 's advice , to go to his house and wait for him . He would go back to town . The monster was leaning against the other side of the big tree . The little man snuffled disgustedly at a sudden overpowering odor of rot . He reached for his handkerchief , fumbled and dropped it . As he bent to pick it up , the monster 's arm whuffed heavily in the air where his head had been  --  a blow that would certainly have removed that baby-face protuberance . The man stood up and would have put the handkerchief to his nose had it not been so bloody . The creature behind the tree lifted its arm again just as the little man tossed the handkerchief away and stepped out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would take him back to town . The monster pounced on the handkerchief , picked it up , studied it , tore it across several times and inspected the tattered edges . Then it gazed vacantly at the disappearing figure of the little man , and finding him no longer interesting , turned back into the woods . Babe broke into a trot at the sound of the shots . It was important to warn Uncle Alton about what her father had said , but it was more interesting to find out what he had bagged . Oh , he 'd bagged it , all right . Uncle Alton never fired without killing . This was about the first time she had ever heard him blast away like that . Must be a bear , she thought excitedly , tripping over a root , sprawling , rolling to her feet again , without noticing the tumble . She 'd love to have another bearskin in her room . Where would she put it ? Maybe they could line it and she could have it for a blanket . Uncle Alton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening  --  Oh , no . No . Not with this trouble between him and dad . Oh , if she could only do something ! She tried to run faster , worried and anticipating , but she was out of breath and went more slowly instead . At the top of the rise by the edge of the woods , she stopped and looked back . Far down in the valley lay the south thirty . She scanned it carefully , looking for her father . The new furrows and the old were sharply defined , and her keen eyes saw immediately that Cory had left the line with the cultivator and had angled the team over to the shade trees without finishing his row . That was n't like him . She could see the team now , and Cory 's pale-blue denim was nowhere in sight . She giggled lightly to herself as she thought of the way she would fool her father . And the little sound of laughter drowned out , for her , the sound of Alton 's hoarse dying scream . She reached and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The shots came from up around here somewhere . She stopped and listened several  | times , and then suddenly heard something coming toward her , fast . She ducked under cover , terrified , and a little baby-faced man in black , his blue eyes wide with horror , crashed blindly past her , the leather case he carried catching on the branches . It spun a moment and then fell right in front of her . The man never missed it . Babe lay there for a long moment and then picked up the case and faded into the woods . Things were happening too fast for her . She wanted Uncle Alton , but she dared not call . She stopped again and strained her ears . Back toward the edge of the wood she heard her father 's voice , and another'sprobably the man who had dropped the brief case . She dared not go over there . Filled with enjoyable terror , she thought hard , then snapped her fingers in triumph . She and Alton had played Injun many times up here ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practiced birdcalls until she knew them better than the birds themselves . What would it be ? Ah  --  blue jay . She threw back her head and by some youthful alchemy produced a nerve-shattering screech that would have done justice to any jay that ever flew . She repeated it , and then twice more . The response was immediate  --  the call of a blue jay , four times , spaced two and two . Babe nodded to herself happily . That was the signal that they were to meet immediately at The Place . The Place was a hide-out that he had discovered and shared with her , and not another soul knew of it ; an angle of rock beside a stream not far away . It was n't exactly a cave , but almost . Enough so to he entrancing . Babe trotted happily away toward the brook . She had just known that Uncle Alton would remember the call of the blue jay , and what it meant . In the tree that arched over Alton 's scattered body perched a large jay bird , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the presence of death , hardly noticing Babe 's realistic cry , it screamed again four times , two and two . It took Cory more than a moment to recover himself from what he had seen . I le turned away from it and leaned weakly against a pine , panting . Alton . That w as Alton lying there , in  --  parts . " God ! God , God , God ? " Gradually his strength returned , and he forced himself to turn again . Stepping carefully , he bent and picked up the .32-40 . Its barrel was bright and lean , but the butt and stock were smeared with some kind of stinking rottenness . Where had he seen the stuff before ? Somewhere  --  no matter . He cleaned it off absently , throwing the beliruled bandanna away afterward . Through his mind tan Alton 's words  --  was that only last night ? ? ' I 'm goin ' to start trackin ' . An ' I 'm inn ' to keep trackin ' till I find the one done this job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found Alton 's box of shells . The box was  | wet and sticky . That made it  --  better , somehow . A bullet wet with Alton 's blood was the right thing to use . He went away a short distance , circled around till he found heavy footprints , then came back . " I 'm a-trackin ' for you , bud , " he whispered thickly , and began . Through the brush he followed its wavering spoor , amazed at the amount of filthy mold about , gradually associating it with the thing that had killed his brother . There was nothing in the world for him anymore but hate and doggedness . Cursing himself for not getting Alton home last night , he followed the tracks to the edge of the woods . They led him to a big tree there , and there he saw something else  --  the footprints of the little city man . Nearby lay some tattered scraps of linen , and  --  what was that ? Another set of prints  --  small ones . Small , stub-toed ones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Somewhere a blue jay called . Babe stopped and turned when she heard her father 's voice , faint with distance , piercing . " Listen at him holler , " she crooned delightedly . " Gee , he sounds mad . " She sent a jay bird 's call disrespectfully back to him and hurried to The Place . It consisted of a mammoth boulder beside the brook . Some upheaval in the glacial age had cleft it , cutting out a huge V-shaped chunk . The widest part of the cleft was at the water 's edge , and the narrowest was hidden by bushes . It made a little ceilingless room , rough and uneven and full of pot-holes and cavelets inside , and yet with quite a level floor . The open end was at the water 's edge . Babe parted the bushes and peered down the cleft . " Uncle Alton ! " she called softly . There was no answer . Oh , well , he 'd be along . She scrambled in and slid down to the floor . She loved it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chattering stream filled it with shifting golden lights and laughing gurgles . She called again , on principle , and then perched on an outcropping to wait . It was only then she realized that she still carried the little man 's brief case . She turned it over a couple of times and then opened it . It was divided in the middle by a leather wall . On one side were a few papers in a large yellow envelope , and on the other some sandwiches , a candy bar , and an apple . With a youngster 's complacent acceptance of manna from heaven , Babe fell to . She saved one sandwich for Alton , mainly because she did n't like its highly spiced bologna . The rest made quite a feast . She was a little worried when Alton had n't arrived , even after she had consumed the apple core . She got up and tried to skim some flat pebbles across the roiling brook , and she stood on her hands , and she tried to think of a story to tell herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ration , ' the turned  | again to the brief case , took out the papers , curled up by the rocky wall and began to read them . It was something to do , anyway . There was an old newspaper clipping that told about strange wills that people had left . An old lady had once left a lot of money to whoever would make the trip from the Earth to the Moon and back . Another had financed a home for cats whose masters and mistresses had died . A man left thousands of dollars to the first person who could solve a certain mathematical problem and prove his solution . But one item was blue-penciled . It was : One of the strangest of wills still in force is that of Thaddeus M. Kirk , who died in 1920 . It appears that he built an elaborate mausoleum with burial vaults for all the remains of his family . He collected and removed caskets from all over the country to fill the designated niches . Kirk was the last of his line ; there were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mausoleum was to be kept in repair permanently , and that a certain sum was to be set aside as a reward for whoever could produce the body of his grandfather , Roger Kirk , whose niche is still empty . Anyone finding this body is eligible to receive a substantial fortune . Babe yawned vaguely over this , but kept on reading because there was nothing else to do . Next was a thick sheet of business correspondence , bearing the letterhead of a firm of lawyers . The body of it ran : In regard to your query regarding the will of Thaddeus Kirk , we are authorized to state that his grandfather was a man about five feet , five inches , whose left arm had been broken and who had a triangular silver plate set into his skull . There is no information as to the whereabouts of his death . He disappeared and was declared legally dead after the lapse of fourteen years . The amount of the reward as stated in the will , plus accrued interest , now amounts to a fraction over sixty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces the remains , providing that said remains answer descriptions kept in our private files . There was more , but Babe was bored . She went on to the little black notebook . There was nothing in it but penciled and highly abbreviated records of %i.its to libraries ; quotations from hooks with titles like " History of Angelina and ' vier Counties " and " Kirk Family History . " Babe threw that aside , too . When . could Jude Alton be ? she began to sing tunelessly , " Tumalumalum turn , ta ta ta , " pretending to dAnt r a minuet with flowing skirts like a girl she had seen in the movies . A  | rustle of the bushes at the entrance to The Place stopped her . She peeped upward , saw them being thrust aside . Quickly she ran to a tiny cul-de-sac in the rock wall , just big enough for her to hide in . She giggled at the thought of how surprised Uncle Alton would be when she jumped out at him . She heard the newcomer come shuffling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor . There was something about the sound  --  What was it ? It occurred to her that though it was a hard job for a big man like Uncle Alton to get through the little opening in the bushes , she could hear no heavy breathing . She heard no breathing at all ! Babe peeped out into the main cave and squealed in utmost horror . Standing there was , not Uncle Alton , but a massive caricature of a man : a huge thing like an irregular mud doll , clumsily made . It quivered and parts of it glistened and parts of it were dried and crumbly . Half of the lower left part of its face was gone , giving it a lopsided look . It had no perceptible mouth or nose , and its eyes were crooked , one higher than the other , both a dingy brown with no whites at all . It stood quite still looking at her , its only movement a steady unalive quivering . It wondered about the queer little noise Babe had made . Babe crept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain running round and round in tiny circles of agony . She opened her mouth to cry out , and could not . Her eyes bulged and her face flamed with the strangling effort , and the two golden ropes of her braided hair twitched and twitched as she hunted hopelessly for a way out . If only she were out in the open  --  or in the wedgeshaped half-cave where the thing was  --  or home in bed ! The thing clumped toward her , expressionless , moving with a slow inevitability that was the sheer crux of horror . Babe lay wide-eyed and frozen , mounting pressure of terror stilling her lungs , making her heart shake the whole world . The monster came to the mouth of the little pocket , tried to walk to her and was stopped by the sides . It was such a narrow little fissure , and it was all Babe could do to get in . The thing from the wood stood straining against the rock at its shoulders , pressing harder and harder to get to Babe . She sat up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost thick enough to see , and a wild hope burst through her voiceless fear . It could n't get in ! It could n't get in because it was too big ! The substance of its feet spread slowly under the tremendous strain and at its shoulder appeared a slight crack . It widened as the monster unfeelingly crushed itself against the rock , and suddenly a large piece of the shoulder came away and the being twisted slushily three feet farther in . It lay quietly with its muddy eyes fixed on her , and then brought one thick arm up over its head and reached . Babe scrambled in the inch farther she had believed impossible , and the tilthv  | clubbed hand stroked down her back , leaving a trail of muck on the blue denim of the shirt she wore . The monster surged suddenly and , lying full length now , gained that last precious inch . A black hand seized one of her braids , and for Babe the lights went out . When she came to , she was dangling by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her high , so that her face and its featureless head were not more than a foot apart . It gazed at her with a mild curiosity in its eyes , and it swung her slowly back and forth . The agony of her pulled hair did what fear could not do gave her a voice . She screamed . She opened her mouth and puffed up her powerful young lungs , and she sounded off . She held her throat in the position of the first scream , and her chest labored and pumped more air through the frozen throat . Shrill and monotonous and infinitely piercing , her screams . The thing did not mind . It held her as she was , and watched . When it had learned all it could from this phenomenon , it dropped her jarringly , and looked around the half-cave , ignoring the stunned and huddled Babe . It reached over and picked up the leather brief case and tore it twice across as if it were tissue . It saw the sandwich Babe had left , picked it up , crushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that she was free , and just as the thing turned back to her she dove between its legs and out into the shallow pool in front of the rock , paddled across and hit the other bank screaming . A vicious little light of fury burned in her ; she picked up a grapefruit-sized stone and hurled it with all her frenzied might . It flew low and fast , and struck squashily on the monster 's ankle . The thing was just taking a step toward the water ; the stone caught it off balance , and its unpracticed equilibrium could not save it . It tottered for a long , silent moment at the edge and then splashed into the stream . Without a second look Babe ran shrieking away . Cory Drew was following the little gobs of mold that somehow indicated the path of the murderer , and he was nearby when he first heard her scream . He broke into a run , dropping his shotgun and holding the .32-40 ready to fire . He ran with such deadly panic in his heart that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred yards past it before she burst out through the pool and ran up the bank . He had to run hard and fast to catch her , because anything behind her was that faceless horror in the cave , and she was living for the one idea of getting away from there . He caught her in his arms and swung her to t him , and she screamed on and on and on . Babe did n't see Cory at all , even when he held her and quieted her . The monster lay in the water . It neither liked nor disliked this new element . It rested on the bottom , its massive head a foot beneath the surface , and it curiously considered the buts that it had garnered . There was the little humming noise of Itals ' s voice that sent the monster questing into the cave . There  | was the black material of the brief case that resisted so much more than green things when he tore it . There was the little two-legged one who sang and brought him near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this new cold moving thing he had fallen into . It was washing his body away . That had never happened before . That was interesting . The monster decided to stay and observe this new thing . It felt no urge to save itself ; it could only be curious . The brook came laughing down out of its spring , ran down from its source beckoning to the sunbeams and embracing freshets and helpful brooklets . It shouted and played with streaming little roots , and nudged the minnows and pollywogs about in its tiny backwaters . It was a happy brook . When it came to the pool by the cloven rock it found the monster there , and plucked at it . It soaked the foul substances and smoothed and melted the molds , and the waters below the thing eddied darkly with its diluted matter . It was a thorough brook . It washed all it touched , persistently . Where it found filth , it removed filth ; and if there were layer on layer of foulness , then layer by foul layer it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mind the poison of the monster , but took it up and thinned it and spread it in little rings round rocks downstream , and let it drift to the rootlets of water plants , that they might grow greener and lovelier . And the monster melted . " I am smaller , " the thing thought . " That is interesting . I could not move now . And now this part of me which thinks is going , too . It will stop in just a moment , and drift away with the rest of the body . It will stop thinking and I will stop being , and that , too , is a very interesting thing . " So the monster melted and dirtied the water , and the water was clean again , washing and washing the skeleton that the monster had left . It was not very big , and there was a badly-healed knot on the left arm . The sunlight flickered on the triangular silver plate set into the pale skull , and the skeleton was very clean now . The brook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skeleton , six grim-lipped men who came to find a killer . No one had believed Babe , when she told her story days later . It had to be days later because Babe had screamed for seven hours without stopping , and had lain like a dead child for a day . No one believed her at all , because her story was all about the bad fella , and they knew that the bad fella was simply a thing that her father had made up to frighten her with . But it was through her that the skeleton was found , and so the men at the bank sent a check to the Drews for more money than they had ever dreamed about . It was old Roger Kirk , sure enough , that skeleton , though it was found five miles from where he had died and sank into the forest floor where the hot molds builded around his skeleton and emerged  --  a monster . So the Drews had a new barn and fine new livestock and they hired four men . But they did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Babe screams at night and has grown very thin .  | ? either alien , or very definitely not alien , just different . Depends on how you use the word . Also written in ' 39 or early ' 40 ; England was at war , and I wrote out of my experience in the Merchant Marine . Also , it was a fun story . Later on , I stopped writing fun stories for a very long time . I got pretty grim , I did .. . I heard somebody say she was haunted . She was n't haunted . There 's another name for what ailed her , and I 'll tell you about it if you like . I was aboard her when it started , and before . I knew every sheared rivet on her . I knew her v lien she was honest , a drab and prosaic member of our merchant marine . I saw what happened to her . She was one of those broad-shouldered old hulks built by the dozen during War I. Her sisters lay rotting and rusting and waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They make good shrapnel . Her name was 1 , wnlght , she was seven thousand tons , a black oil tanker , limped like a three-legged dog , and was as beautiful as a wart . She could do nine knots downhill with a fair wind and an impossible current . When she was loaded she steered well until the loss of weight from burned fuel in the after bunkers threw her down by the head , and then she proceeded as will any tanker with a tom hack aft ; when she was light she drew seventeen feet aft and nothing forward , so that when the wind blew abeam she spun on her tail like a canoe . Yes , I knew her of old . She used to carry casing-head . That 's airplane gas that nukes explosive vapors at around 40 ? F. So one ( lay a fireman found a+n head seeping through the seams of No. 9 tank into the firenxom and  | evaporating there . He fainted dead away , and the crew took to the boats during the night . The Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his coffee , put two and two together , and with the help of two engineers and a messman , worked her into a cove in a small island off Cuba . It so happened that a very wealthy gentleman thereabouts turned up with a nice offer , with the result that the Old Man and his three finks made for Havana in a lifeboat with their pockets full of large bills and the ship 's log , which contained an entry describing her explosion and sinking . After that she carried crude oil for the wealthy gentleman to war zones . Great sport . What made it such great sport was that not only did the Dawnlight have no business being afloat , but she had no business being in her particular business . Her nationality was determined by the contents of the flag locker , and her current log looked like a set of the Encyclopaedia Britannica . They 'd run up one flag or another , and pick a log to suit . But she paid well and she fed well , and if you could keep away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd find her good shipping . If you must commit suicide , you might as well get rich doing it . I caught her in a certain drydock that makes a good thing out of doing quick work and asking few questions . Her skipper was a leathery old squarehead whose viscera must have been a little brown jug . Salt cracked off his joints when he moved . He was all man back aft and all devil on the bridge , and he owned our souls . Not that that was much of a possession . The crew matched the ship , and they were the crummiest , crustiest , hardbitten bunch of has-been human beings ever to bless the land by going to sea . Had to be that way . Any tanker is a five-hundred-foot stick of dynamite , even if she is n't an outlaw . If she 's loaded , she 'll burn forever and a week ; and if she 's light she 'll go sky-high and never come down . All she needs is a spark from somewhere . That can happen easily enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both sides of the martial fence  --  swift , deadly back-stabbers , carrying many and many a spark for our cargoes . We had nothing for protection but luck and the Old Man . We stuck to him . The Dawnlight was the only ship I 'd have taken , feeling the way I was . Once in a while the world gangs up on a guy , and he wants an out . The Dawnlight was mine  --  she 'd pulled me through a couple of dark spots in the past  --  once when a certain dope fell and cracked his silly skull in a brawl over a girl , and I had to disappear for a while , and once when I married the girl and she took to blackmailing me for a living . Aside from all this , though , the Dawnlight was the only ship I could get aboard . I carried an ordinary seaman 's certificate , indorsed for wiper . The Department of Commerce was very lenient with me and let me keep those ratings after I ran a naval auxiliary tanker on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ( ) Id Man gave me the eight-to-twelve watch as third mate , papers or no  | papers . It was that kind of a ship . He was that kind of a skipper . He had the idea I was that kind of a sailor . We left the drydock ( it 's up North somewhere  --  that 'll do ! ) and headed east and south . We were in ballast , carrying only two hundred big cases of farm machinery in the two dry cargo holds . Farm machinery with steel-jacketed noses and percussion caps . Nice chunky crates of tractors with rifled barrels . We followed the coastline pretty much , but stayed far off , out of the southbound steamer lanes . This was n't long after the beginning of the war , when all hands ashore and afloat were excited about neutrality zones , so we wanted to keep our noses clean . However , we were n't too worried . We were n't the only gray-painted , unidentified hulk at sea by any means , and anyway , we had the skipper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due east . It was early fall  --  the hurricane season  --  but the weather was fine and mellow . We kept the morning sun a point off the starboard bow , and in the evening we tore up the base of the shadow we threw ahead . The black gang talked of an unheard-of sixty-three revolutions per minute from the engine , when she had n't done better than fifty-seven in the last twelve years . Every time I shot the sun or a star on my watch , the ship stood still and waited for me to get it , and I navigated as if I had a radio beam in my pocket . It did n't seem like the old Dawnlight anymore , with her rotten gear and her chewing-gum calking . It was a pleasure to work her . Even Cajun Joe 's sea bread stopped giving me heartburn . Yes , it was too good to be true , so in the long run it did n't turn out to be true . After we reached longtitude 30 ? everything about that ship went haywire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the matter of the sextants , for instance . Four of them  --  mine , and the first 's , and the second 's , but worst of all , the Old Man 's ancient binocular-type monster . They all went just a little bit off  --  enough to throw us eight or ten degrees off course . You see , after we passed 30 , we changed course a shade north to head us up toward Gibralter ; and no sooner had we done that than clouds popped up from nowhere and the w eat her got really thick . Nights we sailed in a black soup , and days we sailed in a white one , and the oinpass was the only thing that would even admit where we might be . Things got screwy . The revolution counter said we were making a wabbly seven point t .. ( ) knots . The patent log claimed an even six . But it was n't until the third day of fog , about five bells on my morning watch , that we really found out that we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I'here was a hole in the clouds , high on the starboard beam ; I saw it coming up , figured it would show the sun , and whistled up the Old Man and the mate . was right ; it was a small hole , and as the three of ' us lined up on the wing of 11w ? bridge with our sextants , the second cane bumbling sleepily up with his .  | Old Johnny Weiss was at the wheel , steadying the lubberline onto the compass card the only way an old shellback trained in sail can steer a ship . " Watch the clock , Johnny , " I said and got the image of that cloud hole on my mirror . " Hi , " he said , which was the nearest any of us came to " Aye-aye , sir , " on that scow . We froze there , the four of us , each sextant steady as a rock , waiting for the gleam . It came , and the Old Man said " Hup ! " and we fixed our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old clock in the wheelhouse was chronometer enough for us  --  and we broke out our tables . Our four sights came out close enough . Position , 31 ? 17 ' N , 33 ? 9 ' 40 " W  --  which landed us about four hundred miles due east of the Madeiras . We found that if we split the difference between the distance-run given by the deck and engine logs , we 'd reach that position by dead reckoning . It looked good  --  too good . The Dawnlight was balky steering , what with her outmoded hydraulic telemotor and her screw-type steering engine . She 'd never performed that way . As soon as I was alone in the chart house I went over my figures . Everything was jake , but  --  the primary mirror on my sextant was askew . Slipped down a bit in its frame . Why , a thing like that could prove us a hundred and fifty miles off course ! It had never happened before  --  it was a new sextant , and I took care of it . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office and went in . He and the mate were bent over the desk . They straightened as I came in . " Cap'n I ? " " Vot reading dit you get on your sun gun ? " he asked me before I could finish my speech . I told him . He scratched his head and looked at the mate . The mate said : " Yeah , me , too . " He was a Boston Irishman named Toole ; four foot eleven in his shoes . He was wanted for four very elaborate murders . He collected seventeenth-century miniatures . " I got the same thing , only my sextant 's on the bum . That could n't be right . Look  --  the eyepiece on the ' scope is off center . " " Look now here , " The Old Man took down his behemoth , and showed me a gradation plate sliding around loosely over its pulled rivets . " Yust py accident I gat the same . " " My gosh ! That 's what I came down to tell you , skipper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose mirror on my instrument . Just then Harry , the second mate , edged into the room . He always edged through doors on the mistaken assumption that he was thinner fore and aft than he was across the beam . It was hard to tell . Harry saw everything and said nothing , and if he was as innocent as he hugely looked , he would not have been aboard the Dawnlight . I le said : " Cap , m ' readin ' on that sight was off . My . extant ? "  | " ? has gone gebrochen . Do n't tell me dis too . " " Why ... yeh . Yeh . " " Four sextants go exactly the same amount off at the same time for four different reasons , " said Toole , examining a bent arc track on Harry 's sun gun . The captain sighed . No one said anything for a minute , and we hardly noticed it when the captain 's deck lamp winked off . The engine room speaking tube shrieked and I answered it because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Third mate . " " Tell the Old Man that No. 2 generator just threw its armature . Cracked the casing all to hell . " " What 's the matter with No. 1 ? " " Damfino . Fused solid two hours ago . And no spares for anything , and no cable to wind a new armature . " " O.K. " I turned and told the skipper . He almost laughed . " I vas yust going to say dot ve 'd haf to take a radio bearing on Gibraltar and Feisal . Heh . Did n't y'u tell me , ' Arry , dot dere vas no acid for the batteries on the radio ? " " I did . " " Heh . " The skipper drummed for a moment on his desk , looking at me without seeing me . Then he saw me . " Vot de dirty hell are y'u duing down here . en y'u 're on vatch ? Gat up dere ! " I got  --  there were times when you could n't play around with the old boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea was slick and the air was c arm , and I had to fumble around to locate the bridge ladder . Johnny was steering steadily , easily , a couple of spokes each way every couple of minutes . Ili was the only man aboard that had the feel of that crazy ship , with her %%arped keel and her scored and twisted propeller . He looked up at me as I . topped into the wheelhouse and grunted . " What 's up , Johnny ? " " Reckon you know where we are , huh ? " " I reckon . " No sense in getting the crew talking . Sailors gossip like a bridge club , and for the same reason  --  grouped people with the same basic interests . I 've seen three quarters of a crew packed up and ready to leave because some wiseacre started the rumor that a ship was going to be sold for scrap at the next port . Johnny grunted , and I went into the chart room to monkey with that slipped in my sextant . The way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ u . It main , but then you ca n't tell about an African coastwise fog . What had tn.nl Jiihnny so cluiiiical ? The more I tried to think of something else , the  | more that bothered me . About ten minutes later , working on the theory that the last word said before a long pause is the one that sticks , I went back into the wheelhouse and asked : " Why do you want to know ? " " Oh , nothin ' . " He spat , and the tobacco juice rang a knell on the cuspidor . " Jest thinkin ' . " " Come on  --  give . " " Waal  --  seems to me we been steerin ' east b ' nor'east about two days  --  right ? " " So ? " " Youse guys was so busy peekin ' through yer sextants at the Big Light that you did n't see it was in the wrong place . " " The sun ? In the wrong place ? " " Yep . Steerin ' east b ' nor'east this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun 'd show about broad on the bow at ten thirty in th ' mornin ' . " " Well ? " " So it shows up high an ' dead abeam . Do n't seem right , somehow . " He was right . I went and sat down on the pilot 's stool . Radio dead , sextants haywire ; all we have is the compass and gold old Bowditch 's dead-reckoning tables . And now  --  the compass ? " Johnny , are you sure you were on course when we took that sight ? " His silence was eloquent . Old Johnny Weiss could steer anything with a rudder unless it had a steering oar , and then he was better than most . If we had a radio , we could check the compass . We had no radio . If we could get a sun sight , we would n't need the radio . We could n't get a sun sight . We were lost  --  lost as hell . We were steering a rock-steady compass course on a ship that was pounding the miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she was heading bravely into nowhere . An ordinary seaman popped in . " Lost the patent log , sir ! " Before I could say , " Oh , well , it did n't work , anyway , " the engine-room tube piped up . " Well ? " I said into it , in the tone that means " Now what ? " It was the third engineer again . " Is the skipper up there ? " " No . What is it ? " " A lot of things happen , " wailed the third . " Why do they all have to happen to me ? " " You do n't know , shipmate , you do n't know ! What 's up ? " " The rev-counter arm worked loose and fell into the crank pit . The I.P. piston grabbed it and hauled counter and all in . Goddlemighty , what goes on here ? We jinxed ? " " Seems as though , " I said , and whistled down the captain 's tube to report the latest . Everything depended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have  | calculated our speed at least from the revolution readings , a tide chart and propslip table . The admiralty charts do n't give a damn about this particular section of sea water . Why should they ? There 's supposed to be a deep around the Madeiras somewhere , but then again there 's flat sand aplenty off Africa . Even the skipper 's luck would n't pull us out of this . I had a feeling . Damn it , we could n't even hail a ship , if we met one . It would be bound to turn out a q-ship or a sub-chaser , tickled to death to pinch our cargo . Farm machinery . Phooey ! The saloon messman came up carrying clean sheets for the chart-room cot . I knew what that meant . The bridge was going to be the skipper 's little home until we got out of this  --  if we did . I was dead beat . Things like this could n't happen  --  they could n't ! We had a council of war that night , right after I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened all day ; the sun came out only once , on the twelve to four , and ducked in again so quickly that Harry could n't get to his sextant . He did set the pelorus on it , but the ship rolled violently because of some freak current just as he sighted , and the altitude he got was all off . There 'd been nothing else  --  Oh , yes ; we 'd lost three heaving lines over the side , trying to gauge our speed with a chip . The darnedest thing about it was that everything else was going as well as it possibly could . The cook had found nine crates of really fancy canned goods in the linen locker  --  Lord knows how long they 'd been there . It was just as if they 'd been dropped out of nowhere . The engines ran without a hitch . The low-pressure cylinder lost its wheeze , and in the washrooms we got hot water when we wanted it instead of cold water or steam . Even the mattresses seemed softer . Only we just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put his hand on my shoulder and startled me , coming up behind me in the darkness that way . I was standing out on the wing of the bridge . " Vot 's de matter ; vorried about de veather ? " he asked me . He was funny that way , keeping us on our toes with his furies and his  --  what was it ? ? kindnesses . " Well , yes , cap'n I do n't like the looks of this . " I le put his elbows on the coaming . " I tell y'u boy , ve ai n't got nodding to fret about . " ' ' Oh , I guess not , but I do n't go for this hide-'n ' - go- seek business . " I could feel hum regarding me carefully out of the corners of his eyes . " I want to tell y'u something . If I said dis to de mate , or Harry , or vun of de plat k gang , dcy vould say : ' I t'ink de of squarehead is suckin ' vind . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y'u . " I was flattered .  | " Dis is a old ship but she is good . I am going to be sorry to turn her over to sumvun else . " " What are you talking about , skipper ? You 're not quitting when we get back ? " " No ; before dat . Dass all I vorry about , y'u see . Dis vill be de first command I lost half a trip out . I vas master of thirty-two ships , but I always left dem in der home port . It vo n't be like dat now . " I was more than a little taken aback . I 'd never seen the stringy old gun runner sentimental about his ship before . This was the first time I 'd ever heard him mention it in printable terms . But what was all this about losing his command ? " What 's the matter , cap'n  --  think we 'll go to camp ? " That was a Dawnlight idiom and meant being picked up by a warship of some kind . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch us . Nobody can touch us now . Ah  --  hear dat ? " He pointed far out to port . The night was very still , with hardly a sound but the continual seethe of millions of bursting bubbles slithering past the ship 's side . But far out in the fog was an insistent splashing  --  that heavy smacking splash that every seaman knows . " Porpoise , " I said . The skipper tugged at my elbow and led me through the wheelhouse to the other wing . " Listen . " There it was again , on the starboard side . " Must be quite a few of ' em , " I said laconically , a little annoyed that he should change the subject that way . " Dere is plenty , but dey are not porpoises . " " Blackfish ? " " Dey is not fish , too . Dey is somet'ing y'u have seen in books . Dey is vimmin with tails on . " " What ? " " O.K. , I vas kidding . Call me ven y'u are relieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light I saw him hand me a piercing gaze ; then he shambled back to the chart room . A little bit short of breath , I went into the wheelhouse and lit a cigarette . The cuspidor rang out , and I waited for Johnny to speak . " The skipper ai n't nuts , " he said casually . " Somebody is , " I returned . " You heard him , then . " " Listen  --  if the skipper told me the devil himself was firing on the twelve to four , then the devil it would be . " Johnny was fiercely loyal under that armor of easy talk . " I 've heard them porpoises ' of yours for three days now . Porpoises do n't follow a ship two hundred yards off . They 'll jump the bow wave fer a few minutes an ' then high-tail , or they 'll cross yer bow an ' play away . These is  | different . I 've gone five degrees off to port an ' then to starboard to see if I could draw ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curled some shag under his lip . " Aw , that 's . . . that 's screwy , Johnny . " He shrugged . " You 've shipped with the Old Man before . He sees more than most of us . " And that 's all he 'd say . It was about two days later that we began to load . Yeah , that 's what I said . We did n't dock , and we did n't discharge our farm machinery . We took on ? whatever it was our cargo turned out to be . It was on the four to eight in the evening when the white fog was just getting muddy in the dusk . I was dead asleep when the ship sat down on her tail , stuck her bow up and heeled over . The engines stopped , and I got up from the corner of my room where the impact had flung me . She lay still on her side , and hell was breaking loose . Toole had apparently fallen up against the fire-alarm button , and the lookout forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A broken steam line was roaring bloody murder , and so was the second mate . The whistle , at least , was quiet  --  it had fallen with a crash from the " Pat Finnegan " pipe . I leaned against the wall and crouched into a pair of pants and staggered out on deck . I could n't see a blasted thing . If the fog had been thick before , it was twenty times as thick now . Someone ran into me , and we both went skittering into the scuppers . It was the mate on his way down to the captain 's room . Why the Old Man was n't on the bridge , I could n't savvy , unless it had to do with that peculiar . attitude of resignation about his imagined loss of command . " What the hell ? " I wanted to know . Toole said : " Who is that  --  third mate ? Oh . I do n't know . We 've hit something . We 're right up on top of it . Ai n't rocks ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; no sand bank this size could stay this far from land . " " Where 's the skipper ? " " In his room , far as I know . C'm on , let 's roll him out . " We groped our way to the alleyway door and into the midship house . Light was streaming from the skipper 's room , and as we approached the door we heard the rare , drawn-out chuckle . I 'll never forget the shock of seeing this best .. f captains , a man who had never dented a bilge plate in his life , sprawled back in his tilted swivel chair with his feet on a tilted desk , chuckling into a tilted I , , , t t le of Scotch . Toole squawked : " Cap'n ! We 've struck something ! " The skipper giggled . He had a terrific load on . I leaned past Toole and shook hum . " Skipper ! We 've struck ! " f le looked at us blearily . " I Ieh . Sid-down , hoyss , ( le trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vust finished . flch ! "  | " Clear the boats , " Toole said aside to me . The skipper heard him . " Vait ! " he said furiously , and lurched to his feet . " I am still in command here ! Do n't lower no boats . Ve are not in distress , y'u hear ? Heh ! Ve are loading . I know all about it . Go an ' see for y'uselfs , so y'u do n't belief me ! " Toole stared at the captain for a moment . I stood by . If Toole decided the Old Man was nuts , he 'd take over . If not , then the squarehead was still running the show . Suddenly Toole leaned over and cut the master switch on the alarm system . It had a separate little battery circuit of its own , and was the only thing electrical aboard that still operated . The silence was deafening as the alarm bells throughout the ship stilled , and we could hear a bumble of voices from back aft as the crew milled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no panic . Toole beckoned me out of the room and left . Once we were outside he said : " What do you think ? " " I think he 's ? I du n no , Toole . He 's a seaman first and a human being afterward . If he says we 're not in distress , it 's likely true . Course , he 's drunk . " Toole snorted . " He thinks better when he 's drunk . Come on , let 's look around . " We dropped down the ladder . The ship lay still . She was careened , probably with her starboard side under water and the starboard rail awash . Toole said : " Let 's go to port . Maybe we can see what it is we 've hit . " We had to go on all fours to get up there , so steeply was the deck canted . It did us no good ; there was nothing to be seen anywhere but fog . Toole clung with one arm to the chain rail and puffed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " I hung over the edge . " Ca n't even see the water line . " " Let 's go down to the starboard side . She must be awash there . " She was . I stepped ankle-deep into sea water before I knew where I was . The sea was dead calm , and the fog was a solid thing ; and something was holding the ship heeled over . I tell you , it was a nasty feeling . If only we knew what was under us ! And then  --  we saw the ship being loaded . May I never see another sight like that one . As if to tease and torture us , the fog swirled silently away from the ship 's side , leaving a little dim island of visibility for us to peer into . We could see fifty or sixty feet of deck , and the chain rails fore and aft dipping into the sea at our feet ; and we could see a round patch of still water with its edges wetting the curtain of fog . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw them at the same time and froze , speechless . Coming toward us over the water they were  --  dozens of them . The water was like a resilient , glossy sheet of paving , and the impression of dozenshundreds  --  of feet ran across it to the ship . But there was nothing making the footprints . Just  --  fix ) tprints . Oh , my God !  | There were big splay ones and big slow ones , and little swift ones and plodding ones . Once something long and invisible crept with many legs up to the ship , and once little pointed feet , high-arched , tripped soundlessly over the chains and something fell sprawling a yard from where we stood . There was no splash , but just the indentation in the water of a tiny , perfect body that rolled and squirmed back onto its feet and ran over to the deck and disappeared . I suddenly felt that I was in the midst of a milling crowd of  --  of people . Nothing touched me , and yet , all around me was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pushed and shoved , in their eagerness to get aboard . It was ghastly . There was no menace in it , nor anything to fear except that here was a thing that could not be understood . The fog closed down suddenly , and for a long moment we stood there , feeling the pressure of that mob of " passengers " ; and then I reached out and found the mate 's arm and tugged him toward the midship house . We crawled up the canted ladder and stood by the glow from the lamp in the captain 's room . " It 's a lot of goddam nonsense , " I said weakly . " Hm-m-m . " I did n't know whether or not Toole agreed with me . The skipper 's voice came loosely from the porthole . " Heh ! I cert'n'y t'ank y'u for de Scotch , I du . Vat a deal , vat a deal ! " And he burst out into a horrible sound that might have been laughter , in his cracked and grating voice . I stared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , toasting it with a pony of fire water . " He 's seein ' things , " said the mate abruptly . " Maybe all the rest of us are blind , " I said ; and the mate 's dazed expression made me wonder , too , why I had said that . Without another word he went above to take over the bridge , while I went aft to quiet the crew . We lay there for fourteen hours , and all the while that invisible invasion continued . There was nothing any of us could do . And crazy things began happening . Any one of them might have happened to any of us once in a while , hut  --  well , judge for yourself , now . When I came on watch that night there was nothing to do but stand by , L since we were hove to , and I set Johnny to polishing brass . He got his polish and his rag and got to work . I mooned at the fog from the wheelhouse window , and in about ten minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side . " What gives , Johnny ? " " Ai n't no use doin ' this job . Must he the fog . " He pointed to the binnacle cover . " The tarnish smells the polish and fades off all around me rag . On'y 1 ' where I rub it comes in stronger . "  | It was true . All the places he had rubbed were black-green , and around those spots the battered brass gleamed brilliantly ! I told John to go have himself a cup of coffee and settled down on the stool to smoke . No cigarettes in the right pocket of my dungarees . None in the left . I knew I 'd put a pack there . " Damn ! " I muttered . Now where the  --  what was I looking for ? Cigarettes ? But I had a pack of cigarettes in my hand ! Was I getting old or something ? I tried to shrug it off . I must have had them there all the time , only  --  well , things like that do n't happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a smoke and stuck it in my chops , fumbling for a match . Now where ? did some more cussing . No matches . What good is a fag to a guy without a ? I gagged suddenly on too much smoke . Why was I looking for a match ? My cigarette was lit ! When a sailor starts to get the jitters he usually begins to think about the girl he left behind him . It was just my luck to be tied up with one I did n't want to think about . I simply went into a daze while I finished that haunted cigarette . After a while Johnny came back carrying a cup of coffee for me . Now I like my coffee black . Wet a spoon in it and dip it in the sugar barrel , and that 's enough sugar for me . Johnny handed me the cup , and I took the saucer off the rim . The coffee was creamed  --  on a ship that means evaporated milk  --  and sweet as a soft caramel . " Damn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 's the idea of this ? " " What ? " I showed him . When he saw the pale liquid he recoiled as if there had been a snake curled up on the saucer instead of a cup . " S'help me , third , I did n't put a drop of milk in that cup ! Nor sugar , neither ! " I growled and threw cup and saucer over the side . I could n't say anything to Johnny . I knew he was telling the truth . Oh , well , maybe there happened to be some milk and sugar in the cup he used and he did n't notice it . It was a weak sort of excuse , but I clung to it . At six bells the second heaved himself up the ladder . " O.K.-you 're relieved , " he said . " At eleven o'clock ? What 's the idea ? " " Aw ? " His huge bulk pulsed as he panted , and he was sweating . " I could n't sleep , that 's all . Shove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I ever heard of you rolling out before you were called , Harry . What 's the matter  --  this canting too much for you ? " The ship still lay over at about 47 ? . " Naw . I c'n sleep through twice that . It was ? Oh , go below , third . " " 0 . K. Course ' n ' speed the same-zero-zero . The wind is on the weather side , an ' we 're runnin ' between the anchors . The how is dead ahead and the smokestack is att . The temperature ? " " I ) ry up , will ya ? "  | " The temperature is mighty hot around the second mate . What 's eatin ' you , Harry ? " " I 'll tell you , " he said suddenly very softly , so Johnny could n't hear . " It was my bunk . It was full of spikes . I could feel ' em , but I could n't see ' em . I 've got the blue willies , third . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and went aft laughing . I was sorry I had laughed . When I turned in to my bunk it was full of cold , wet worms that crept and crawled and sent me mooning and shuddering to the deck , to roll up in the carpet for some shut-eye . No , I could n't see them . We left there  --  wherever " there " was  --  about fourteen hours after we struck . What it was that had stopped the ship we never did find out . We took soundings all around and got nothing but deep water . Whatever it was that the ship was lying on was directly underneath the turn of the bilge , so that no sounding lead could strike it . After the first surprise of it we almost got used to it  --  it and the fog , thick as banked snow , that covered everything . And all the while the " loading " went on . When it began , that invisible crowding centered around the section of the starboard well deck that was awash . But in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everywhere you went you saw nothing and you actually felt nothing ; and yet there was an increasing sense of being crowded jostled . It happened at breakfast , 7:20 . The skipper was there , and the mate , though he should have been on the bridge . Harry rolled in , too , three hundred pounds of fretful wanness . I gathered that there were still spikes in his bunk . Being second mate , his watch was the twelve to four , and breakfast was generally something he did without . The captain lolled back in his chair , leaning against the canted deck and grinning . It made me sore . I refused the bottle he shoved at me and ordered my eggs from the messman . " Na , do n't be dat vay , " said the skipper . Everyt'ing is under control . Ve is all going to get a bonus , and nobody is going to get hurt . " " I do n't savvy you , cap'n , " I said brusquely . " Here we are high and dry in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone haywire , and you 're tickled to death . If you know what 's going on , you ought to tip us off . " The mate said , " He 's got something there , captain . I want to put a boat over the side , at least , and have a look at what it is that 's grounded us . I told you that last night , and you would n't let a boat leave the chocks . What 's the idea ? do n't you want to know ? " The captain ( lipped a piece of sea bread into the remains of four eggs on his plate . " Look , boyss , did n't I pull y'u out of a lot of spots before dis ? Did I ever let y'u down vet ? Ileh . Veil , I vo n't now . " The mate looked exasperated . **** but this calls for a little more than seamanship , skipper . "  | " Not from y'u it do n't , " flared the captain . " I know vat goes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it . Y'u 'll make out all right . " I decided to take matters into my own hands . " Toole , he 's got some silly idea that the ship is out of our hands . Told me the other night . He 's seeing ghosts . He says we were surrounded by vimmin mit tails on . ' " The mate cocked an eyebrow at the Old Man . The captain lurched to his feet . " Veil , it 's true ! An ' I bat y'u y'ur trip 's pay against mine dat I gat one for myselfl Ve is taking on a cargo of ? " He swallowed noisily and put his face so close to mine that our foreheads nearly touched . " Vare de hell y'u t'ink I got dis viskey ? " he bellowed . " Somebody has chartered dis ship , and ve 'll get paid . Vot y'u care who it is ? Y'u never worried before ! " He stamped out . Harry laughed hollowly , his four pale chins bobbing . " I guess that tells you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said hotly . " I trust the Old Man as much as anyone , but I 'm not going to take much more of this . " " Take it easy , man , " soothed Harry . He reached for the canned milk . " A lot of this is fog and imagination . Until the skipper does something endangering crew , ship or cargo we 've got no kick . " " What do you call staying in his room when the ship rams something ? " " He seems to know it 's all right . Let it go , mate . We 're O.K. , so far . When the fog clears , everything will be jake . You 're letting your imagination run away with you . " He stared at Toole and upended the milk can over his cup . Ink came out . I clutched the edge of the slanting table and looked away and back again . It was true enough  --  black ink out of a milk can I 'd seen the messman open three minutes before . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toole nor Harry noticed it . Harry put the can on the table and it slid down toward Toole . " All right , " said Toole , " we 'll keep our traps shut until the skipper pulls something really phony . But I happen to know we have a cargo consigned to a Mediterranean port ; and when and if we get off this sandbank , or whatever it is , I 'm going to see to it that it 's delivered . A charter is a charter . " He picked up the can and poured . Blood came out . It drove me absolutely screwball . He would n't watch what he was doing ! Harry was working on a pile of scrambled eggs , and the mate was looking at me , and my stomach was missing beats . I muttered something and went up to the bridge . Every time there was some rational explanation developing , something like that had to happen . Know why I could n't pipe up about what I had seen ? Because after the ink and the blood hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go telling people that you 're bats ! It was ten minutes to eight , but as usual , Johnhy Weiss was early . He was a  | darn good quartermaster  --  one of the best I ever sailed with . A very steady guy , but I did n't go for the blind trust he expressed in the skipper . That was all right to a certain extent , but now " Anything you want done ? " he asked me . " No , Johnny , stand by . Johnny  --  what would you do if the officers decided the captain was nuts and put him in irons ? " " I 'd borry one of the Old Man 's guns an ' shoot the irons off him , " said my quartermaster laconically . " An ' then I 'd stand over him an ' take his orders . " Johnny was a keynote in the crew . We were asking for real trouble if we tried anything . Ah , it was no use . All we could do was to wait for developments . At eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lurch of it threw every man jack off his feet . With a splash and a muffled scraping , the Dawnlight settled deeply from under our feet , righted herself , rolled far over to the other side , and then gradually steadied . After I got up off my back I rang a " Stand-by " on the engine-room telegraph , whistled down the skipper 's speaking tube , and motioned Johnny behind the wheel . He got up on the wheel mat as if we were leaving the dock in a seaport . Not a quiver ! Old Johnny was one in a million . I answered the engine room . " All steamed up and ready to go down here ! " said the third engineer 's voice . " And I think we 'll have that generator running in another twenty minutes ! " " Good stuff ? " I said , and whistled for the skipper . He must have felt that mighty lurch . I could n't imagine why he was n't on the bridge . He answered sleepily : " Vell ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What do you want to do  --  lay here ? Or are we going some place ? " There was silence for a long time  --  so long that I called and asked him if he was still on the other end of the tube . " I vas getting my orders , " he said . " Yes , ve go . Full speed ahead . " " What course ? " " 1 low should I know ? I 'm through now , third . You 'll get y'ur orders . " " From Toole ? " " No ! " " I Icy , if you ai n't captain , who is ? " " I vould n't know about dat . Full speed ahead ! " The plug on his end of the tube clicked into place , and I turned toward Johnny , uncertain what to do . " I It said fill ahead , did n't he ? " asked Johnny quietly . " Yeah , but ? " " Ave , aye , sir , " he said with just a trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over from " Stand-by " to " Full ahead . " I put out my hand , and then shrugged and stuck it in my pex  --  ket . I 'd tell  | Toole about it when I came off watch . " As you go , " I said , not looking at the compass . " As she goes , sir , " said Johnny , and began to steer as the shudder of the engines pounded through the ship . The mate came up with Harry at noon , and we had a little confab . Toole was rubbing his hands and visibly expanding under the warmth of the bright sun , which had shone since three bells with a fierce brilliance , as if it wanted to make up for our three days of fog . " How 's she go ? " he asked me . " Due west , " I said meaningly . " What ? And we have a cargo for the Mediterranean ? " " I only work here , " I said . " Skipper 's orders . " Harry shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say , " he grunted . " Do you want to get paid this trip ? " snapped Toole . He picked up the slip on which I had written the ship 's position , which I 'd worked out as soon as I could after the sun came out . " We 're due south of the Madeiras and heading home , " he went on . " How do you think those arms shippers are going to like our returning with their cargo ? This is the payoff . " Harry tried to catch his arm , but he twisted away and strode into the wheelhouse . The twelve-to-four quartermaster had n't relieved Johnny Weiss yet . " Change course , " barked the mate , his small , chunky body trembling . " East-nor'east ! " Johnny looked him over coolly and spat . " Cap'n changes course , mate . " " Then change course ! " Toole roared . " The squarehead 's nuts . From now on I 'm running this ship ! " " I ai n't been told of it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , by God , I 'm the mate ! " Toole said . " You 've had no orders from that lunatic to disregard a command of a superior officer . Steer east ! " Weiss gazed out of the wheelhouse window , taking his time about thinking it over . The mate had made his point ; to refuse further would be rank insubordination . Though Johnny was strong in his loyalty to the skipper , he was too much of a seaman to be pig-headed about this until he knew a little better where he stood . " East it is , sir , " he said , and his eyes were baleful . He hauled at the wheel , and a hint of a grin cracked his leathery face . " She  --  wo n't answer , sir ! " I saw red . " Go below ! " I growled , and butted him from behind the wheel with my shoulder . He laughed aloud and went out . I grasped the two top spokes , hunched my shoulders and gave a mighty heave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel , and my own violence threw me heels over crupper into the second mate , and we spun and tumbled , all his mass of ' lard on top of me . It was like lying under an anchor .  | The wind was knocked out of him , and he could n't move . I was smothering , and the mate was too surprised to do anything but stare . When Harry finally rolled off me it was a good two minutes before I could move . " Damn that quartermaster , " I gasped when we were on our feet again . " Was n't his fault , " wheezed Harry . " He really tried to spin the wheel . " Knowing Johnny , I had to agree . He 'd never pull anything like that . I scratched my head and turned to the mate . He was steering now , apparently without any trouble at all . " Do n't tell me you can turn the ship ? " He grinned . " All it needed was a real helmsman , " he ribbed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . rang and spun over to " Stop , " and the engine-room tube squealed . " Now what ? " " I du n no , " came the third 's plaintive voice . " She just quit on us . " " O.K. ; let us know when you 've shot the trouble . " The engineer rang off . " Now what the hell ? " said the mate . I shrugged . " This is a jinxed trip , " I said . I verified the " Stop " signal on the telegraph . Harry said : " I do n't know what 's got into you guys . The skipper said somethin ' about a new charter . He do n't have to tell us who gave it to us . " " He do n't have to keep us in the dark , either , " said Toole . Then , glancing at the compass , he said , " Looka that ! She 's swingin ' back to west ! " I looked over his shoulder . Slowly the ship was turning in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she came to 270 ? on the card  --  the engines began to pound . " Ah ! " said the mate , and verified the " Full ahead " gong that had just rung . The third whistled up again and reported that he was picking fluff off his oilskins . " I 'm going on the wagon , " he said . " She quits by herself and starts by herself , an ' I 'm gon na bust out cryin ' if it keeps up ! " And that 's how we found out that the shp , with this strange cargo , insisted on having her head . For every time we tried to change course , the engines would stop , or a rudder cable would break , or the steering engine would quit . What could we do ? We stood our watches and ran our ship as if nothing were the matter . If we had n't we 'd have gone as mad as we thought we already were . I tarry noticed a strange thing one afternoon . He told me about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o ' books in the chart room ? " he asked me . I did . It was an American Merchant Marine Library Association book chest , left aboard from the time the ship was honest . I 'd been pretty well all through It . There were a few textbooks on French and Spanish , half a dozen detective nets , a pile of ten-year-old magazines , and a miscellaneous collection of mphlets and unclassifiable.  | " Well , about three o'clock I hear a noise in the chart room , " said Harry , " an ' I have a look . Well , sir , them books is heaving ' emselves up out of the chest and spilling on th ' deck . Most of ' em was just tossed around , but a few was stackin ' in a neat heap near the bulkhead . I on'y saw it for a second , and then it stopped , like I 'd caught someone at the job , but I could n't see no one there . " He stopped and licked his lips and wheezed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' they was all to do with North America an ' the United States . A coupla history books , an atlas , a guidebook to New York City , a book on th ' national parks ? all sech . Well , I goes back into the wheelhouse , an ' a few minutes later I peeks in again . All them books on America was open in different places in the chart room , an ' the pages was turnin ' like someone was readin ' them , only  --  there just was n't nobody there ! " What the hell was it that we had aboard , that wanted to know about the United States , that had replaced our captain with a string of coincidence , that had " chartered " the ship ? I 'd had enough . I firmly swore that if I ever got back to the States , police or no , I 'd get off this scow and stay off her . A man can stand just so much . About three days out the torpedo boat picked us up . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wicked , and she belonged to a nation that likes to sink arms and runners . One of the nations , I mean . I had just come off watch , and was leaning on the taffrail when I saw her boiling along behind us , overtaking . I ran forward , collaring an ordinary seaman . " Run up some colors , " I said . " I do n't give a damn what ones . Hurry ! " Pounding up the ladder . I hauled Toole out of the wheelhouse , pointed out the raider and dived for the radio shack , which was some good to us now that the generator was going again . I sat down at the key and put on a headset . Sure enough , in a second or two I heard : " What ship is that ? Where from ? Where bound ? " repeated in English , French , German and Spanish . I 'd have called the skipper , but had given him up as a bad job . Toole came in . " They want to know who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are we ? " " Wait 'll I look at the flag the kid is running up , " he said . He went to the door , and I heard him swear and whistle . " Give a look , " he said . Flying from the masthead was a brilliant green flag on which was a unicorn , rampant . I 'd seen it  --  where . was it ? Years ago oh , yes ; that was it ! In a book of English folk tales ; that was supposed to be the standard of Oberon and Titania , King and Queen of . . . of the fairies , the Little Folk ! Dazed , I turned to the key and began pounding . I did n't even realize what I was sending . Some imp controlled my hand , and not until it was sent did I realize I had said , " S.S. Princess of Birmingham , Liverpool , hound for Calais with a load of airplane parts ! " " Thank you ! " said the raider , and put a shell across our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuddered and took hold . Grumbling in every plate , back to the bridge , and I sat there sweating and wondering what the hell to do about this . Of all stupid things to say to an enemy raider ! The engine vibration suddenly became labored and the ship slowed perceptibly . Oh , of course , the old wagon would pick a time like this to become temperamental ! I beat my skull with my fists and groaned . This was curtains . The raider was abeam and angling toward us . " Heave to ! " she kept buzzing through my phones . Through the porthole beside me I could already see the men moving about on her narrow decks . I turned to my key again and sent the commander of the raider some advice on a highly original way to amuse himself . In answer he brought his . four swivel guns to bear on us . The bridge tube whistled . Toole said , " What the hell did you say to him ? He 's fixin ' to sink us ! " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know nothing ! " I ripped off the headset and put my elbows on the port ring across the room , staring out to sea with my back to the swiftly approaching raider . And there in the sunny waves was a conning tower , periscope and all ! Now get this . Here we were , lying helpless , going dead slow with crippled engines between a surface raider and a sub . We were meat for anyone working for any government . Most of us were Americans ; if the raider took us it would mean an international incident at a time when no one could afford one . If the sub took us , it was the concentration camp for us . Either might , and probably would , sink us . We were outlaws . I went up on the bridge . No sense doing anything now . If we got into boats , we 'd likely be cut down by machine-gun bullets . Toole was frantically tugging at the handle of the engine-room telegraph . " I 'm trying to stop her ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's something wrong with the engines . They 're making such a racket back there that the first assistant ca n't hear the tube whistle . The telegraph is jammed ! The helm wo n't answer ! Oh , my God ! " " Where 's your quartermaster ? " Toole jerked a thumb toward the bridge ladder . " I sent him aft to run down to the engine room , and he tripped and fell down to the boat deck ! Knocked himself out ! " I ran to the port wing and looked out at the sub . True to her kind , she was attacking without asking questions . There was a jet of spume , and the swift wake of a torpedo cut toward us . At the rate we were going , it would strike us dust between the after dry-cargo hold  --  where the " farm machinery " was stowed ? and the fire room . It would get both the explosives and the boiler  --  good night nurse ! And then our " coincidental commander " took a hand . The crippled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised her blunt nose eight feet , and  | scuttled forward at a speed that her builders would have denied . In fifty seconds she was doing fourteen knots . The torpedo swept close under our stern , and the raging wash of the tanker deflected it , so that it hurtled ? straight toward the raider ! It struck just aft the stem piece , blowing away the gunboat 's bow and turning her on her beam ends . She righted slowly lying far down by the head , and lay helpless . The sub , seeing her for the first time , came to the surface and men tumbled out of the hatches to man her four-incher . She began blasting away at the torpedo boat as fast as she could load , and the raider answered her , two shots to the sub 's one . And there we left them , and for all I know they are blasting away yet , far too busy to pay attention to a crummy old tankship . And Toole and I  --  well , we cried on each other 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick . The next four days were straight sailing , but for the pranks that were played on us . The skipper stuck to his cabin ; we found out why later , and I ca n't really blame him . There was still no sign of the mob of beings that could be felt aboard , but for  --  again  --  the pranks that were played on us . We stood our watches and we ate our meals and we painted and chipped and scraped as usual . But for the  --  but I said that before . Like the time the buff-colored paint the day gang was laying on the after bulkhead turned the steel transparent for forty-eight hours . Behind the bulkhead was the crew 's washroom . The view from up forward was exquisite . As the four-to-eight fireman expressed it : " I would n't give a damn if the washroom was just fer washin ' . " And lots of little things , like a spoonful of salt turning to thumbtacks in the Cajun 's best gumbo soup , and live lobsters in the linen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and beautiful green grass , and acre of it , with four concentric fairy rings , growing on a flaked hawser in the forward cargo hold ; and then there were the dice that , in the middle of a crap game , developed wickedly humorous caricatures of the six ship 's officers  --  including me . That might not seem like much to you ; but when you remember how clever they were , and when you could never meet one of your crew without his bursting into fits of laughter when he saw your face  --  well , it was n't the best thing in the world for discipline . About the captain ? We got curious , Toole and I , about how he was getting on . He had locked himself in his room , and every once in a while would whistle for more food . He ate fish almost exclusively , in enormous quantities . We decided to do something about it . Some minor pretext to get a peek into his room . He would n't come to the door if we knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could we get the curtain off from the outside without the irascible old man 's coming out with a gun in each hand ? We finally hit on something ideal . We 'd get a broken spar with a snaggy end from somewhere ,  | carry it past his porthole , and " accidentally " stick it in , tearing off the curtain and giving us a good look . I 'm sorry we did . We 'd no business looking into the Old Man 's private life that way . After all , we decided when we batted the wind about it afterward , the Old Man had a right , if he wanted to , to have a . . . a mermaid in his room ! We saw her without being seen , and the skipper must have been in the inner room . She was very lovely , and I got a flash of scales and golden hair , and felt like a heel for looking . Toole and I talked it over one afternoon as we neared the coast . The two of us had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and . besides , Toole was an Irishman . No one will ever know if he was right or not , but his explanation is the only one that will fit all the facts . Pieced together from a two-hour conversation , this is about what he said , and now ? I believe him : " Third , this is a silly trip , hey ? Ah , well . There are many things that you or I ca n't understand , and we 're used to them , like the northern lights and the ways of a woman . I think that the skipper sold us out . No ; no harm to us . " He dragged on his cigar and stared out to sea as he talked . " Something , or somebody , made a deal with him the day after we sailed . Listen ; hear that ? " Far out on the beam sounded the steady smack-splash of huge schools of porpoise . Oh , yes ; they might have been porpoise . " You told me what the skipper said to you about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't know if it was one of them or not ; maybe it was something we could n't see that talked . I think the skipper could . He 's a sduarehead , and they 're seagoing people , and they know the sea from ' way back . He 's been to sea half again as long as the oldest sailor aboard ; you know that . I do n't have to tell you that the sea is something that we 'll never really understand . You ca n't know all about anything , even an atom ; and the sea is so damn big . " Well , he was made an offer ; and it was probably a lifetime supply of whiskey and a week or so with that m-mermaid we  --  thought we saw in his room . What was the deal ? " That he should turn over his ship , and the crew to work it , to whatever party it was that wanted it for a trip from the African coast to America . There must have been provisions , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He must have provided that the ship was to be protected against weather and bullets , mines and torps . He must have stipulated that no one aboard was to be harmed permanently , and  --  I 'm sure of this  --  that ship and cargo were to be returned to him at the end of the trip . Everything else I 've guessed at has turned out , has n't it ? Why not that ? The only thing that really bothers me is the loss of time , het muse time is really big money , in this racket . But you can bet that the ulu.uehea I was n't beaten down . We 'll find out  --  I 'm certain of it . " ' aIHnIt the passengers . Laugh at me and I 'll dry up like a clam ; but I  | believe I have the answer . The old country has inhabitants that men have dreamed and sung and written and told about a great deal , and seen more than seldom . I 've spent a lot of time off watch reading about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  bless her ! Anyway , there was ghosts and pixies , goblins and brownies , and dervishes and fairies and nymphs and peris and dryads and naiads and kelpies and sprites ; gnomes and imps and elves and dwarves and nixies and ghouls and pigwidgeons , and the legion of the leprechauns , and many another . And some were good and some were not , and some helped and some hindered ; but all were mischievous as hell . They were n't too bad , any more than are the snakes and spiders that eat mosquitoes , and many were downright beneficial . " There 's hell to pay in Europe now , third . You ca n't expect a self-respectin ' pixie to hide in a shell hole and watch a baby torn to shreds . They sickened of it , and their boss man , whoever he is , got ' em together and made arrangements to ship ' em some place where there 's a little peace and quiet once in a while , where they can work their harmless spells on a non-aggressive populace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't expect the sea folk to ferry ' em over ; they 're an unreliable lot anyway , to all accounts . " I read a book once about 01 ' Puck , and how the Little People were brought to the British Isles from the Continent . They could n't swim even that , and they got a blind man to row and a deaf mute to stand lookout , and never a word was said of it until Puck himself told of it . This is the twentieth century , and it 's a big ocean they 've got to cross , and there are many more of them . Did ye notice , by the way , " he broke off suddenly , " that though our tanks are empty an ' we 've used fuel and water and stores for near two weeks , that we 're low in the water ? " He laughed . " We 've many and many of ' em aboard . " We 'll unload ' em , and we 'll get our pay for the job . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for you 're in the same boat . We 're r'arin ' , tearin ' lawbreakers aboard here , third , and we do n't give a damn , or we would n't be here . But if there 's any kind of a good place for us to go at the end of the voyage , then we 'll go there for this week 's work . It was always a good thing to help a war refugee . " I did n't laugh . I went away by myself and chewed and swallowed that , and 1 thought about it a bit , and now I believe what I believe , and maybe a little bit more . It 's a big world , and these are crazy times . Well , almost as we expected , we unloaded , but it only took us three hours instead of fourteen . Yes , we struck fog off the Carolinas , and the ship nosed up and heeled over in it , and we could feel the pressure getting less aboard . And when the thing under the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out Well , this is the part that is hard to explain . I wo n't try it . But look : It was the twenty-third day of September when we railed from the drydock . And  | when we lay off the coast that way , just out of the fog , it was the twenty-fifth . And it would have taken just three days for us to reach there from the drydock . Somewhere we lost a week . Yeah . And the bunkers were full of fuel . And the lockers were full of stores . And the fresh-water tanks were full of water , just as they had been . But  --  there 's a difference . Any fuel we use is  --  or acts like  --  high-grade stuff . And our food tastes better , and the work is easier . Yeah , we 're lawbreakers  --  outlaws . But we take our ship where we please , when we please , and never a warship do we see , and never a shell or mine touches us . Oh , yeah ; they say she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . She is  --  enchanted . We 're paid , and we 're being paid . And we 'll go anywhere and do anything , because we have the best skipper a man ever sailed under , and because , more than any other men on earth , we need not be afraid of death . But I ca n't forget that there 'll be hell an ' all to pay ashore !  | I 'm so very glad to see this one back in print . Written some time in early 1940 , this and the next four were written in an extraordinarily prolific ( for me ) period in early 1940 , ( luring which my editor , the late John Campbell , hoarded them and pieced them out ; I saw none of them in print until I returned to the States after managing a hotel in Jamaica , then , when the U.S. got into the war , working as a heavy equipment operator in Jamaica ( for the Army ) and in Puerto Rico ( for the Navy ) . From 1940 until late ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Killdozer ) ? six solid years of " writers 's block " ? the worst I have ever known . But about " Poker Face , " 1940 : I wonder what was in George Orwell 's mind just then , eight years before he wrote his terrifyingly prescient 1984 ? We all had to get up early that morning , and we still had n't sense enough to get up from around the poker table . We 'd called in that funny little guy from the accounting department they called Face to make it a foursome with the three of us . It had been nip and tuck from nine o'clock on  --  he played a nice ? game of stud . But tonight there was no one lucky man , and when Harn jokingly bet a nickel on a pair of fours and l ) elehanty took him up on it , the game degenerated into penny-ante . After a while we lirrgot whose deal it was and sat around just batting the breeze . " Screwy game , " said Delehanty . " What 's the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even ? Must be your influence , Face . Never happened before . We generally hand all our money over to Jack after four deals . Hey , Jack ? " I grinned . " The game still owes me plenty , bud , " I said . " But I think you 're right about Face . I do n't know if you noticed it , but damn if that winning did n't go right around behind the deal  --  me , you , Face , Harry , me again . If 1 won two , everyone else would win two . " Face raised an eyebrow ridge because he had n't any eyebrows . There was n't $ anything particularly remarkable about his features , except that they were absolutely without hair . The others carried an a.m. stubble , but his face gleamed j nakedly , half luminous . He 'd been a last choice , but a pretty good one . He said little , watched everyone closely and casually , and seemed like a pretty nice guy . " Noticed that , did you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's right , " said Harry . " How about it , Face ? What is this power you have over poker ? " " Oh , just one of those things you pick up , " he said . Delehanty laughed outright . " Listen at that , " he said . " He 's like the of mountain climber who saw a volcano erupting in the range he 'd scaled the day before . By damn , ' he says , why ca n't I be careful where I spit ? ' " Everybody laughed but Face . " You think it just happened ? Would you like to see it happen again ? " That stopped the hilarity . We looked at him queerly . Harry said , " What 's the dope ? " " Play with chips , " said Face . " No money , no hard feelings . If you like , I wo n't touch the cards . Just to make it easy , I 'll put it this way . Deal our four hands of stud . Jack 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three fours . Me next with three fives . Harry next with three sixes . Each three-spread will come out hearts , diamonds , clubs , in that order . You , Delehanty , start the deal . Go on  --  shuffle them all you like . " Delehanty was a little popeyed . " You would n't want to make a little bet on that , would you ? " he breathed . " I would not . I do n't want to take your money that way . It would be like picking pockets . " " You 're bats , Face , " I said . " There 's so little chance of a shuffled deck coming out that way that you might as well call it impossible . " " Try it , " said Face quietly . I ) elehaitty counted the cards carefully , shuffled at least fifteen times with his very efficient gambler 's rifle , and dealt around quickly . The cards flapped down In front of me  --  a jack face down , a six , and then  --  three threes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody said anything for a long time . Finally , " Jack 's got it , " Harry breathed . " Let me see that deck , " snapped harry . Ile swept it up , spread it out in his nds . " Seems O.K. , " he said slowly , and turned to Face .  | " Your deal , " said Face woodenly . Harry dealt quickly . I said , " Delehanty 's s'posed to be next with three fours  --  right ? " Yeah  --  right ! Three fours lay in front of Delehanty . It was too much  --  cards should n't act that way . Wordlessly I reached for the cards , gathered them up , pitched them back over my shoulder . " Break out a new deck , " I said . " Your deal , Face . " " Let Delehanty deal for me , " said Face . Delehanty dealt again , clumsily this time , for his hands trembled . That did n't matter  --  there were still three fives smiling up at Face when he was through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned half away from the table . I took up the cards . I spent three solid minutes shuffling them . I had Harry cut them and then cut them again myself and then passed them to Delehanty for another cut . I dealt four hands , and Harry 's was the winning hand , with three sixes  --  hearts , diamonds , clubs . Delehanty 's eyes were almost as big now as his ears . He said , " Heaven . All . Might . Tea , " and rested his chin in his hands . I thought he was going to cry or something . " Well ? " said Face . " Were we playing poker with this guy ? " Harry asked no one in particular . When , by a great deal of hard searching , I found my voice again , I asked Face , " Hey , do you do that just any time you feel like it , or does it come over you at odd moments ? " Face laughed . " Any time , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal out thirteen cards to each of us , face down . Then look them over . " I gave him a long look and began to shuffle . Then I dealt . I think we were all a little afraid to pick up our cards . I know that when I looked at mine I felt as if someone had belted me in the teeth with a night stick . I had thirteen cards , and they were all spades . I looked around the table . Delehanty had diamonds . Face had hearts . Harry had clubs . You could have heard a bedbug sneeze in the room until Harry began saying , " Ah , no . Ah , no . Ah , no , " quietly , over and over , as if he were trying to tell himself something . " Can they all do things like that where you come from ? " I asked , and Face nodded brightly . " Can everyone walk where you come from ? " he returned . " Or see , or hear , or think ? Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Harry . " I do n't know , " said Face . " I only know how I came and I could n't explain it to you . " " Why not ? " " I low could you explain an internal-combustion engine to an Australian bushman ? "  | " You might try , " said Delehanty , piqued . " We 's pretty smart bushmen , we is . " " Yeah , " I chimed in . " I 'm willing to allow you the brains to do those card tricks of yours ; you ought to have enough savvy to put over an idea or two . " " Oh  --  the cards . That was easy enough . I felt the cards as you shuffled them . " " You felt with my fingers ? " " That 's right . Want proof ? Jack , your head is itching a little on the right side , near the top , and you 're too lazy to scratch it just yet . Harry 's got a nail pushing into the third toe of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Well , what do you say ? " He was right . I scratched . Harry shuffled his feet and said , " O.K. , but what has that got to do with arranging the cards that way ? Suppose you did feel them with our hands  --  then what ? " Face put his elbows on the table . " As for arranging the cards , that was done in the shuffle . You grasp half of the deck in each hand , bend them , let them flip out from under your thumbs . If you can control the pressure of each thumb carefully enough , you can make the right cards fall into the right places . You all shuffled at least four times ; that made it that much easier for me . " Delehanty was popeyed again . " How did you know which cards were supposed to go in which places ? " " Memorized their order , of course , " said Face . " I 've seen that done in theaters even by men like you . " " So 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't told us how you arranged the deal . If you 'd done the shuffling I could see it , but ? " " But I did do the shuffling , " said Face . " I controlled that pressure of your thumbs . " " How about the cuts ? " Delehanty put in , finding that at last we had him on the run . " When Jack dealt he handed the pack to Harry and me both to be cut . " " I not only controlled those cuts , " said Face calmly , " but I made you do it . " " Go way , " said Delehanty aggressively . " Do n't give us that . How 're you going to make a man do anything you like ? " " Skeptical animal , are n't you ? " grinned Face ; and Delehanty rose slowly , walked around the table , caught Harry by the shoulders and kissed him on both cheeks . Harry almost fell off his chair . Delehanty stood there rockily , his eyes positively bulging . Suddenly he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forth made me do that ? " he wanted to know . " Chummy , ai n't you ? " grinned Harry through his surprise . Face said , " Satisfied , Delehanty ? " Delehanty whirled on him . " Why you little ? " His fury switched off like a light going out . " Right again , Face . " He went over and sat down . I never saw that Irishman hack down like that before .  | " You made him do that ? " I asked . Face regarded me gravely . " You doubt it ? " We locked glances for a moment , and then my feet gathered under me . I had a perverse desire to get on all fours and bark like a dog . It seemed the most natural thing in the world . I said quickly , " Not at all , Face , not at all ! " My feet relaxed . " You 're the damnedest fellow I ever saw , " said Harry . " What kind of a man are you , anyway ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Face , and looked at Delehanty . " So am I , " said Harry , " but I ca n't make cards sit up and typewrite , or dumb Irishers snuggle up to their fellowmen . " " Do n't let that bother you , " said Face . " I told you before  --  there 's nothing more remarkable in that than there is in walking , or seeing , or hearing . I was born with it , that 's all . " " You said everyone was , where you come from , " Harry reminded him . " Now spill it . Just where did you come from ? " " Geographically , " said Face , " not very far from here . Chronologically , a hell of a way . " Harry looked over my way blankly . " Now what does all that mean ? " " As near as I can figure out , " said Face , " it means just what I said . I come from right around here  --  fifty miles , maybe  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Years away ? " I asked , by this time incapable of being surprised . " You mean ' ago , ' do n't you ? " " Away , " repeated Face . " I came along duration , not through time itself . " " Sounds very nice , " murmured Delehanty to a royal flush he had thumbed out for himself . Face laughed . " Duration is n't time  --  it parallels it . Duration is a dimension . A dimension is essentially a measurement along a plane of existence . By that I mean that any given object has four dimensions , and these extend finitely , along four planes  --  length , width , height , duration . The last is no different from the others ; nor is it any less tangible . You simply take it for granted . " When you 're ordering a piece of lumber , for instance , you name its measurements . ' You say you want a two by six , twelve feet long . You do n't order its duration ; you simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimension to suit your needs . You would build better if you measured it as carefully as you do the others , but your life span is too short for you to care that much . " " I think I savvy that , " said Harry , who had been following carefully , " but what do you mean by saying that you came ' along ' duration ? " " Again , just what I said . You ca n't move without moving along the plane of dimension . If you walk down the street , you move along its length . IF you go up in an elevator , you move along its height . I came along duration . "  | " You mean you projected yourself into the fourth dimension ? " asked Henry . " No ! " said Face violently , and snorted . " I told you  --  duration is a dimension , not another set of dimensions . Can you project yourself into length , or height , or into any one dimension ? Of course not ! The four are interdependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no mystery about the fourth dimension . It is n't an impalpable word . It 's a basis of measurement . " I said , " What 's this business of your traveling along it ? " Face spread out his hands . " As I said before , duration is finite . Suppose you wanted to walk from Third Street to Fifth Street . First you 'd locate a sidewalk that would take you in the direction you were going . You 'd follow that until it ended . Then you 'd locate one that would take you to your destination . Where the one stopped and the other started is Fourth Street . Now if you want to go twenty blocks instead of two , you simply repeat that process until you get where you 're going . " Traveling along duration is exactly the same thing . Just as you enter a street at a certain point in its length , so you encounter an object on the street at a certain point in its duration . Maybe it 's near the beginning , maybe near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't project yourself into it . All objects have two terminations in duration  --  inception and destruction . You travel along an object 's duration until it ceases to exist beside you because you have reached the end of it  --  or the beginning . Then you proceed to find another object so that you may continue in the same direction , exactly is you proceeded to find yourself another sidewalk in your little trek across town . " .4 " I 'll be damned , " said Delehanty , " I can understand it ! " " Me , too , " Harry said . " That much of it . But exactly how did you travel along duration ? I can get the idea of walking beside a building 's length , for Instance , but I ca n't see myself walking along beside . . . er . . . how long it fasted , if you see what I mean . Or do I see what I mean ? " " Now you 're getting to something that may be a little tough to explain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your language that could cover it . About Itt ( . clearest way for me to put it is this : My ability to travel in that particular rrction is the result of my ability to perceive it . If you could only perceive two dimensions , length and breadth , you would be completely in the dark about the source of an object which dropped on you from above . If you could n't sense the distance from here to the door  --  if you did n't know the door Imisted , nor the distance to it , you would n't be able to make the trip . I can see pf ? along duration as readily as you can see up and down a road . I can move along It rdually readily . " " Do you stay in one place while you travel duration ? " I asked suddenly . " I can . I do n't have to , though . You can go forward and upward while you sure to the left , ca n't you ? Mix ' em anyway you like . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty thousand years . How is that possible ? You do n't look as if you 're much older than I am . " " I 'm not , " said Face , " in point of years existed . That is , I did n't live those years . I  --  passed them . " " How long did it take you ? " Face smiled . " Your question is ridiculous , Harry . How long ' is a durational ' term . It involves passage of time , which is a convenient falsehood . Time is static , objects mobile . I ca n't explain a true state of affairs from the basis of a false conception . " Harry shut up . I asked him something that had been bothering me . " Where did you come from , Face , and  --  why ? " He looked at me deeply , that eyebrow ridge rising a trifle . " I came  --  I was sent . I came because I was qualified for the job , I was sent because  --  well , someone had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What city ? " " I do n't know . It had a name , I suppose , but it was forgotten . There was no need for a name . Do you name your toothbrush , or your bed sheets , or anything else that has been nearly a part of you all your life ? No one ever left the city , no one ever arrived at it . There were other cities , but no one cared about them , where they were , who their people were and what they were like , and so on . There was no need to know . The city was independent and utterly self-sufficient . It was the ultimate government . It was not a democracy , for each individual was subjugated entirely to the city . But it was not a dictatorship as you know the term , for it had no dictators . It had no governing body , as a matter of fact . It did n't need one . It had no laws but those of habit and custom . I It ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth by the action of the centuries . It was an anarchistic society in the true sense of anarchism  --  society without need of government . " " That 's an impossibility , " said Harry , who had a reputation as a minor barroom sociologist . " I came from that city , " Face reminded him gently . " Why is it impossible ? You must take certain things into account before you make such rash statements . Your human nature is against such an organization . Your people would be like lost sheep  --  possibly like lost wolverines  --  under such a set-up . But my people were not like that  --  not after centuries of breeding for the most desirable traits , living circumscribed ways of life , thinking stereotyped thoughts . Imagine it if you can . " Now the city was divided into two halves , like the halves of a great brain . For every death there was a birth ; for every loss there was a gain or an equal loss on the other side . The equation was kept balanced , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immortal and static . " " What did they do with their spare time ? " asked Ilarrv.  | " They lay in their cubicles until they were needed . " " Were there no theaters , ball games  --  nothing like that ? " asked Delehanty . Face shook his head . " Amusement is for the relaxation of an imperfect mind , " he said . " A mind that has been trained to do one thing and one thing only needs no stimulation or change of pace . " " Why was the city so big ? " asked Harry . " Good gosh , a civilization like that does n't mean anything . Why did n't it simply degenerate into the machines that ruled it ? Why keep all those humans if they must live like machines ? " Face shrugged . " When the city was instituted , there was a population of that size to allow for . Then , it had a rigid human government , and there was crime and punishment and pain and happiness . They were disposed of in a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the city was designed on the philosophy that what is not logical is also not necessary . By that time the city was too steeped in its own traditions ; there was no one left to make such a radical change as to cut down on the population . The city could care for that many  --  likewise it could not exist as it was unless it did care for that many . Many human offices were disposed of as they became unnecessary and automatic . One of these was that of controller of population . The machines took care of that  --  they and the unbreakable customs . " " Hell ! " said Delehanty explosively . " I would n't go for that . Why did n't the people push the whole thing over and get some fun out of life ? " " They did n't want it ! " said Face , as if he were repeating a self-evident fact , and was surprised that he had to . " They had never had that sort of life ; they never heard or read or saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do things like that than you have to play pattycake ! They were n't constituted to enjoy it . " " You still have n't told us why you left the place , " I reminded him . " I was coming to that . In the city there was.a necessity for the pursuance of ertain knowledges , as a safety measure against the time when one or another of the machines might need rebuilding by a man who understood them . f " One of these men was an antiquarian named Hark Vegas , which is really not a name at all but a combination of sounds indicating a number . His field vas history  --  the development of all about him , from its earliest recorded tttvthologies and beyond that to its most logical sources . In the interests of the i t v , he so applied himself to his work that he uncovered certain imponderables ? Itistorical trends which were neither logical nor in harmony with the records . I hey were of no importance , perhaps , but their existence interfered with the 1wrfection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unimportant matters was to investigate them personally . And so  --  that is what he did . " I It waited until his successor was thoroughly trained , so that in any eventu.Alit the city would not he left without an antiquarian for more than a very  | little while , and he studied carefully the records of the city 's customs . These forbade any citizen 's leaving the city , and carefully described the boundaries thereof . They were so very old , however , that they neglected to stipulate the boundaries along the duration dimension , since duration perception was a development of only the past four or five thousand years . As an antiquarian , Hark Vegas was familiar with the technique . He moved himself out along the duration of a metallic fragment and thus disappeared from the city . " Now this unheard-of happening disturbed the timeless balance of the city , for Hark Vegas was nowhere to be found . Within seconds of his disappearance , news of it had reached the other half of the city , and the group of specialists there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the first place , my field was-damn it , there 's no word for it in your language yet . It 's a mental science and has to do with time perceptions . At any rate , I was the only one whose field enabled him to reason where Hark Vegas had gone . Secondly , Hark Vegas was my contemporary in the other half of the city . We would both be replaced within a week , but during that week there would be one too many in my half of the city , one too few in his  --  an intolerable , absolutely unprecedented state of affairs . There was only one thing to do , since I was qualified , and that was to find him and bring him back . My leaving would restore the balance ; if I were successful in finding him , our return would not disturb it . It was the only thing to do , for the status quo had to be maintained at all costs . I acquired a piece of the metal he had used  --  an easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catalogued  --  and came away . " Face paused to light a cigarette . The man smoked , I had noticed , with more sheer enjoyment than anyone I had ever met . " Well , " said Harry impatiently , " did you find him ? " Face leaned back in a cloud of blue smoke and stared dreamily at the ceiling . " No , " he said . " And I 'll tell you why . " I ran into a characteristic of dimensions that was so utterly simple that it had all but escaped me . Let me give you an example . How many sides has a cube ? " " Six , " said Harry promptly . Face nodded . " Exactly . Excluding the duration dimension , the cube is a three-dimensional body and has six sides . There are two sides as manifestations of each dimension . I think I overlooked that . You see , there are four dimensions , but eight  --  directions ! " He paused , while the three of us knotted our brows over the conception . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down . Forward and backward  --  and beginningwards ' and endwards ' ? the two directions in the duration dimension ! " l ) elchanty raised his head slowly . " You mean you  --  did n't know which way to go ? "  | " Precisely . I entered the durational field and struck off blindly in the wrong direction ! I went as far as I reasoned Hark Vegas had gone , and then stopped to look around . I found myself in such a bewildering , uproarious , chaotic world that I simply had n't the mental equipment to cope with it . I had to retreat into a deserted place and develop it . I came into your world  --  here , about eight years ago . And when I had begun to get the ways of this world , I came out of hiding and began my search . It ended almost as soon as it had begun , for I stopped searching ! " Do you know what happened to me ? Do you realize that never before had I seen color , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise , confusion , growth , death , laughter ? Can you imagine my delighted first glimpses of a street fight , a traffic jam , a factory strike ? I should have been horrified , perhaps  --  but never had I seen such beautiful marvels , such superb and profound and moving happenings . I threw myself into it . I became one of you . I became an accountant , throttling down what powers I alone of all this earth possess , striving for life as a man on an equal footing with the rest of men . You ca n't know my joy and my delight ! I make a mistake in my entries , and the city  --  this city , does not care or suffer for it , but brawls on unheeding . My responsibilities are to myself alone , and I defy my cast-steel customs and laugh doing it . I 'm living here , you see ? Living ! Go back ? Halt ! " " Colors , " I murmured . " Noise , and happy filth , and sorrows and screams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile grew slowly and then flashed away . He stared at me like some alabaster-faced statue for nearly a full minute , and then the agile tendrils of his mind whipped out and encountered mine . We clutched each other thus , and the aura of our own forces around us struck two men dumb . " Hark Vegas , " he said woodenly . I nodded . He straightened , drew a deep breath , threw back his head and laughed . " Phis colossal joke , " he said , wiping his eyes , " was thirty-eight thousand years in the making . Pleased to meet you  --  Jack . " We left then . Harry and Delehanty ca n't remember anything but a poker game .  | I have always disliked this story  --  not for its basic idea , which has been called unique , but for its writing . Just out of my ' teens , I had not yet learned that nobody is ever and altogether good , and nobody is all bad . Ignorant of that , one can produce 100% purified vintage dyed-in-the-wool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is indeed unique , and many years later , at the Artificial Intelligence offices in M.I.T. , a truly great scientist introduced himself to me , to tell me ( as many scientists have ) that he had gotten into science in the first place because of reading science fiction as a youngster , and further , that he had gotten into microbiology because of this one story . And this is a guy who might win a Nobel Prize ! So ... what price literary judgments ? Here is a story about a man who had too much power , and a man who took too much , but do n't worry ; I 'm not going political on you . The man who had the power was named James Kidder and the other was his banker . Kidder was quite a guy . He was a scientist and he lived on a small island off the New England coast all by himself . He was n't the dwarfed little gnome of a mad scientist you read about . His hobby was n't personal profit , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was n't insidious , and he was n't even particularly subversive . He kept his hair cut and his nails clean and lived and thought like a reasonable human being . He was slightly on the baby-faced side ; he was inclined to be a hermit ; he was short and plump and  --  brilliant . His specialty was biochemistry , and he was always called Mr. Kidder . Not " 1 ) r . " Not " Professor . " Just Mr. Kidder.  | He was an odd sort of apple and always had been . He had never graduated from any college or university because he found them too slow for him , and too rigid in their approach to education . He could n't get used to the idea that perhaps his professors knew what they were talking about . That went for his texts , too . He was always asking questions , and did n't mind very much when they were embarrassing . He considered Gregor Mendel a bungling liar , Darwin an amusing philosopher , and Luther Burbank a sensationalist . He never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he was talking to someone who had knowledge , he went in there and got it , leaving his victim breathless . If he was talking to someone whose knowledge was already in his possession , he only asked repeatedly , " How do you know ? " His most delectable pleasure was cutting a fanatical eugenicist into conversational ribbons . So people left him alone and never , never asked him to tea . He was polite , but not politic . He had a little money of his own , and with it he leased the island and built himself a laboratory . Now I 've mentioned that he was a biochemist . But being v hat he was , he could n't keep his nose in his own field . It was n't too remarkable when he made an intellectual excursion wide enough to perfect a method of crystalizing Vitamin B1 profitably by the ton  --  if anyone wanted it by the ton . He got a lot of money for it . He bought his island outright and put eight hundred men to work on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his laboratory and building equipment . He got to messing around with sisal fiber , found out how to fuse it , and boomed the banana industry by producing a practically unbreakable cord from the stuff . You remember the popularizing demonstration he put on at Niagara , do n't mu ? That business of running a line of the new cord from bank to bank over the rapids and suspending a ten-ton truck from the middle of it by razor edges testing on the cord ? That 's why ships now moor themselves with what looks like heaving line , no thicker than a lead pencil , that can be coiled on reels like garden hose . Kidder made cigarette money out of that , too . He went out and bought himself a cyclotron with part of it . After that money was n't money any more . It was large numbers in little ( books . Kidder used little amounts of it to have food and equipment sent out to him , but after a while that stopped , too . His bank dispatched a messenger by tea-plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man returned two days later In a bemused state , having been amazed something awesome at the things he 'd teen out there . Kidder was alive , all right , and he was turning out a surplus of ttxxl lixxl in an astonishingly simplified synthetic form . The bank wrote immediately and wanted to know if Mr. Kidder , in his own interest , was willing to attlllfkase the secret of his dirtless farming . Kidder replied that he would be glad to , and inclosed the formulas . In a P. S. he said that he had n't sent the Inhonuatiom ashore be ause he had n't realized anyone would Iw interested . That  | from a man who was responsible for the greatest sociological change in the second half of the twentieth century  --  factory farming . It made him richer ; I mean it made his bank richer . He did n't give a rap . But Kidder did n't really get started until about eight months after the messenger 's visit . For a biochemist who could n't even be called " Doctor " he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that he turned out : A commercially feasible plan for making an aluminum alloy stronger than the best steel so that it could be used as a structural metal . An exhibition gadget he called a light pump , which worked on the theory that light is a form of matter and therefore subject to physical and electromagnetic laws . Seal a room with a single light source , beam a cylindrical vibratory magnetic field to it from the pump , and the light will be led down it . Now pass the light through Kidder 's " lens " ? a ring which perpetuates an electric field along the lines of a high-speed iris-type camera shutter . Below this is the heart of the light pump  --  a ninety-eight-per-cent efficient light absorber , crystalline , which , in a sense , loses the light in its internal facets . The effect of darkening the room with this apparatus is slight but measurable . Pardon my layman 's language , but that 's the general idea . Synthetic chlorophyll  --  by the barrel . An airplane propeller efficient at eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over old paint , let harden , and then peel off like strips of cloth . The old paint comes with it . That one made friends fast . A self-sustaining atomic disintegration of uranium 's isotope 238 , which is two hundred times as plentiful as the old stand-by , U-235 . That will do for the present . If I may repeat myself ; for a biochemist who could n't even be called " Doctor , " he did pretty well . Kidder was apparently unconscious of the fact that he held power enough on his little island to become master of the world . His mind simply did n't run to things like that . As long as he was left alone with his experiments , he was well content to leave the rest of the world to its own clumsy and primitive devices . He could n't be reached except by radiophone of his own design , and its only counterpart was locked in a vault of his Boston bank . Only one man could operate it . The extraordinarily sensitive transmitter would respond only to Conant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was not to be disturbed except by messages of the greatest moment . His ideas and patents , what Conant could pry out of him , were released under pseudonyms known only to Conant  --  Kidder did n't care . The result , of course , was an infiltration of the most astonishing advancements since the dawn of civilization . The nation profited  --  the world profited . But most of all , the bank profited . It began to get a little oversize . It began getting its fingers into other pies . It grew more fingers and had to bake more figurative pies . Before many years had passed , it was so big that , using Kidder 's many weapons , it almost matched Kidder in lxiwer.  | Almost . Now stand by while I squelch those fellows in the lower left-hand corner who 've been saying all this while that Kidder 's slightly improbable ; that no man could ever perfect himself in so many ways in so many sciences . Well , you 're right . Kidder was a genius  --  granted . But his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core , a student . He applied what he knew , what he saw , and what he was taught . When first he began working in his new laboratory on his island he reasoned something like this : " Everything I know is what I have been taught by the sayings and writings of people who have studied the sayings and writings of people who have  --  and so on . Once in a while someone stumbles on something new and he or someone cleverer uses the idea and disseminates it . But for each one that finds something really new , a couple of million gather and pass on information that is already current . I 'd know more if I could get the jump on evolutionary trends . It takes too long to wait for the accidents that increase man 's knowledge  --  my knowledge . If I had ambition enough now to figure out how to travel ahead in time , I could skim the surface of the future and just dip down when I saw something interesting . But time is n't that way . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else is left ? " Well , there 's the proposition of speeding intellectual evolution so that I can observe what it cooks up . That seems a bit inefficient . It would involve more labor to discipline human minds to that extent than it would to simply apply myself along those lines . But I ca n't apply myself that way . No one man can . " I 'm licked . I ca n't speed myself up , and I ca n't speed other men 's minds up . Is n't there an alternative ? There must be  --  somewhere , somehow , there 's got to Iw an answer . " So it was on this , and not on eugenics , or light pumps , or botany , or atomic physics , that James Kidder applied himself . For a practical man he found the problem slightly on the metaphysical side ; but he attacked it with typical thoroughness , using his own peculiar brand of logic . Day after day he wandered over the island , throwing shells impotently at sea gulls and swearing richly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And only then did he get feverishly to work . Ile worked in his own field , biochemistry , and concentrated mainly on two things  --  genetics and animal metabolism . He learned , and filed away in his insatiable mind , many things having nothing to do with the problem in hand , and very little of what he wanted . But he piled that little on what little he knew or guessed , and in time had quite a collection of known factors to work with . I hs approach was characteristically unorthodox . He did things on the order of multiplying apples by pears , and balancing equations by adding log v - , to one ss.le and s ' to the other . I le made mistakes , but only one of a kind , and later , only one of a species , Ile spent so many hours at his microscope that he had  | to quit work for two days to get rid of a hallucination that his heart was pumping his own blood through the mike . He did nothing by trial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he got results . He was lucky to begin with and even luckier when he formularized the law of probability and reduced it to such low terms that he knew almost to the item what experiments not to try . When the cloudy , viscous semifluid on the watch glass began to move itself he knew he was on the right track . When it began to seek food on its own he began to be excited . When it divided and , in a few hours , redivided , and each part grew and divided again , he was triumphant , for he had created life . He nursed his brain children and sweated and strained over them , and he designed baths of various vibrations for them , and inoculated and dosed and sprayed them . Each move he made taught him the next . And out of his tanks and tubes and incubators came amoebalike creatures , and then ciliated animalcules , and more and more rapidly he produced animals with eye spots , nerve cysts , and then  --  victory of victories  --  a real blastopod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly he developed a gastropod , but once he had it , it was not too difficult for him to give it organs , each with a specified function , each inheritable . Then came cultured mollusklike things , and creatures with more and more perfected gills . The day that a nondescript thing wriggled up an inclined board out of a tank , threw flaps over its gills and feebly breathed air , Kidder quit work and went to the other end of the island and got disgustingly drunk . Hangover and all , he was soon back in the lab , forgetting to eat , forgetting to sleep , tearing into his problem . He turned into a scientific byway and ran down his other great triumph ? accelerated metabolism . He extracted and refined the stimulating factors in alcohol , cocoa , heroin , and Mother Nature 's prize dope runner , cannabis indica . Like the scientist who , in analyzing the various clotting agents for blood treatments , found that oxalic acid and oxalic acid alone was the active factor , Kidder isolated the accelerators and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ever undermined a man 's morality and/or caused a " noble experiment . " In the process he found one thing he needed badly  --  a colorless elixir that made sleep the unnecessary and avoidable waster of time it should he . Then and there he went on a twenty-four-hour shift . He artificially synthesized the substances he had isolated , and in doing so sloughed away a great many useless components . He pursued the subject along the lines of radiations and vibrations . He discovered something in the long reds which , when projected through a vessel full of air vibrating in the supersonics , and then polarized , speeded up the heartbeat of ' small animals twenty to one . They ate twenty times as much , grew twenty times as Fast , and  --  died twenty times sooner than they should have .  | Kidder built a huge hermetically sealed room . Above it was another room , the same length and breadth but not quite as high . This was his control chamber . The large room was divided into four sealed sections , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all kinds . There were also trapdoors fitted with air locks leading from the upper to the lower room . By this time the other laboratory had produced a warm-blooded , snakeskinned quadruped with an astonishingly rapid life cycle  --  a generation every eight days , a life span of about fifteen . Like the echidna , it was oviparous and mammalian . Its period of gestation was six hours ; the eggs hatched in three ; the young reached sexual maturity in another four days . Each female laid four eggs and lived just long enough to care for the young after they hatched . The male generally died , two or three hours after mating . The creatures were highly adaptable . They were small  --  not more than three inches long , two inches to the shoulder from the ground . Their forepaws had three digits and a triplejointed , opposed thumb . They were attuned to life in an atmosphere with a large ammonia content . Kidder bred four of the creatures and put one group in each section of the sealed room . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oxygen content , humidity . He killed them off like flies with excesses of , for instance , carbon dioxide , and the survivors bred their physical resistance into the next generation . Periodically he would switch the eggs from one sealed section to another to keep the strains varied . And rapidly , under these controlled conditions , the creatures began to evolve . This , then , was the answer to his problem . He could n't speed up mankind 's intellectual advancement enough to have it teach him the things his incredible mind yearned for . He could n't speed himself up . So he created a new race  --  a race which would develop and evolve so fast that it would surpass the civilization of man ; and from them he would learn . They were completely in Kidder 's power . Earth 's normal atmosphere would poison them , as he took care to demonstrate to every fourth generation . They would make no attempt to escape from him . They would live their lives and progress and make their little trial-and-error experiments hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on man , for they had Kidder to guide them . It took man six thousand years really to discover science , three hundred to put it to work . It took Kidder 's creatures two hundred days to equal man 's mental attainments . And from then on  --  Kidder 's spasmodic output made the late , great Tom Edison look like a home handicrafter . I le called them Neoterics , and he teased them into working for him . Kidder was inventive in an ideological way ; that is , he could dream up impossible propositions providing he did n't have to work them out . For example , he wanted the Neoterics to figure out fur themselves how to build shelters out of  | porous material . He created the need for such shelters by subjecting one of the sections to a high-pressure rainstorm which flattened the inhabitants . The Neoterics promptly devised waterproof shelters out of the thin waterproof material he piled in one corner . Kidder immediately blew down the flimsy structures with a blast of cold air . They built them up again so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temperature so abruptly that they could not adjust their bodies to it . They heated their shelters with tiny braziers . Kidder promptly turned up the heat until they began to roast to death . After a few deaths , one of their bright boys figured out how to build a strong insulant house by using three-ply rubberoid , with the middle layer perforated thousands of times to create tiny air pockets . Using such tactics , Kidder forced them to develop a highly advanced little culture . He caused a drought in one section and a liquid surplus in another , and then opened the partition between them . Quite a spectacular war was fought , and Kidder 's notebooks filled with information about military tactics and weapons . Then there was the vaccine they developed against the common cold  --  the reason why that affliction has been absolutely stamped out in the world today , for it was one of the things that Conant , the bank president , got hold of . He spoke to Kidder over the radiophone one winter afternoon with a voice so hoarse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told him briskly not to ever call him again in such a disgustingly inaudible state . Conant had it analyzed and again Kidder 's accounts and the bank 's swelled . At first , Kidder merely supplied the materials he thought they might need , but when they developed an intelligence equal to the task of fabricating their own from the elements at hand , he gave each section a stock of raw materials . The process for really strong aluminum was developed when he built in a huge plunger in one of the sections , which reached from wall to wall and was designed to descend at the rate of four inches a day until it crushed whatever was at the bottom . The Neoterics , in self-defense , used what strong material they had in hand to stop the inexorable death that threatened them . But Kidder had seen to it that they had nothing but aluminum oxide and a scattering of other elements , plus plenty of electric power . At first they ran up dozens of aluminum pillars ; when these were crushed and twisted they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more weight . When that failed they quickly built stronger ones ; and when the plunger was halted , Kidder removed one of the pillars and analyzed it . It was hardened aluminum , stronger and tougher than molybd steel . Experience taught Kidder that he had to make certain changes to increase his power over his Neoterics before they got too ingenious . There were things that could be done with atomic power that he was curious about ; but he was not willing to trust his little superscientists with a thing like that unless they could he trusted to use it strictly according to Moyle . So he instituted a rule of  | fear . The most trivial departure from what he chose to consider the right way of doing things resulted in instant death of half a tribe . If he was trying to develop a Diesel-type power plant , for instance , that would operate without a flywheel , and a bright young Neoteric used any of the materials for architectural purposes , half the tribe immediately died . Of course , they had developed a written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a glass-enclosed area in a corner of each section was a shrine . Any directions that were given on it were obeyed , or else . . . . After this innovation , Kidder 's work was much simpler . There was no need for any indirection . Anything he wanted done was done . No matter how impossible his commands , three or four generations of Neoterics could find a way to carry them out . This quotation is from a paper that one of Kidder 's high-speed telescopic cameras discovered being circulated among the younger Neoterics . It is translated from the highly simplified script of the Neoterics . " These edicts shall be followed by each Neoteric upon pain of death , which punishment will be inflicted by the tribe upon the individual to protect the tribe against him . " Priority of interest and tribal and individual effort is to be given the commands that appear on the word machine . " Any misdirection of material or power , or use thereof for any other purpose than the carrying out of the machine 's commands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Any information regarding the problem at hand , or ideas or experiments which might conceivably bear upon it , are to become the property of the tribe . " Any individual failing to cooperate in the tribal effort , or who can be termed guilty of not expending his full efforts in the work ; or the suspicion thereof shall be subject to the death penalty . " Such are the results of complete domination . This paper impressed Kidder as much as it did because it was completely spontaneous . It was the Neoterics ' own creed , developed by them for their own greatest good . And so at last Kidder had his fulfillment . Crouched in the upper room , going from telescope to telescope , running off slowed-down films from his high-speed cameras , he found himself possessed of a tractable , dynamic source of information . Housed in the great square building with its four half-acre sections was a new world , to which he was god . Conant 's mind was similar to Kidder 's in that its approach to any problem was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whether that approach was along the line of most or least resistance . His rise to the bank presidency was a history of ruthless moves whose only justification was that they got him what he wanted . Like an over-efficient general , he would never %. uuluish an enenw through sheer fierce of numbers alone . Ile would also  | skillfully flank his enemy , not on one side , but on both . Innocent bystanders were creatures deserving no consideration . The time he took over a certain thousand-acre property , for instance , from a man named Grady , he was not satisfied with only the title to the land . Grady was an airport owner  --  had been all his life , and his father before him . Conant exerted every kind of pressure on the man and found him unshakable . Finally judicious persuasion led the city officials to dig a sewer right across the middle of the field , quite efficiently wrecking Grady 's business . Knowing that this would supply Grady , who was a wealthy man , with motive for revenge , Conant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and caused it to fold up . Grady lost every cent he had and ended his life in an asylum . Conant was very proud of his tactics . Like many another who has had Mammon by the tail , Conant did not know when to let go . His vast organization yielded him more money and power than any other concern in history , and yet he was not satisfied . Conant and money were like Kidder and knowledge . Conant 's pyramided enterprises were to him what the Neoterics were to Kidder . Each had made his private world ; each used it for his instruction and profit . Kidder , though , disturbed nobody but his Neoterics . Even so , Conant was not wholly villainous . He was a shrewd man , and had discovered early the value of pleasing people . No man can rob successfully over a period of years without pleasing the people he robs . The technique for doing this is highly involved , but master it and you can start your own mint . Conant 's one great fear was that Kidder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to become opinionated . Good heavens  --  the potential power he had ! A little matter like swinging an election could be managed by a man like Kidder as easily as turning over in bed . The only thing he could do was to call him periodically and see if there was anything that Kidder needed to keep himself busy . Kidder appreciated this . Conant , once in a while , would suggest something to Kidder that intrigued him , something that would keep him deep in his hermitage for a few weeks . The light pump was one of the results of Conant 's imagination . Conant bet him it could n't be done . Kidder did it . One afternoon Kidder answered the squeal of the radiophone 's signal . Swearing mildly , he shut off the film he was watching and crossed the compound to the old laboratory . He went to the radiophone , threw a switch . The squealing stopped . " Well ? " " Hello , " said Conant . " Busy ? " " Not very , " said Kidder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , showing the skillful work of a gang of Neoterics synthesizing rubber out of pure sulphur . Ile would rather have liked to tell Conant about it , but  | somehow he had never got around to telling Conant about the Neoterics , and he did n't see why he should start now . Conant said , " Er ... Kidder , I was down at the club the other day and a bunch of us were filing up an evening with loose talk . Something came up which might interest you . " " What ? " " Couple of the utilities boys there . You know the power setup in this country , do n't you ? Thirty per cent atomic , the rest hydroelectric , Diesel and steam ? " " I had n't known , " said Kidder , who was as innocent as a babe of current events . " Well , we were arguing about what chance a new power source would have . One of the men there said it would be smarter to produce a new power and then talk about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that new power , but he could describe it . Said it would have to have everything that present power sources have , plus one or two more things . It could be cheaper , for instance . It could be more efficient . It might supersede the others by being easier to carry from the power plant to the consumer . See what I mean ? Any one of these factors might prove a new source of power competitive to the others . What I 'd like to see is a new power with all of these factors . What do you think of it ? " " Not impossible . " " Think not ? " " I 'll try it . " " Keep me posted . " Conant 's transmitter clicked off . The switch was a little piece of false front that Kidder had built into the set , which was something that Conant did n't know . The set switched itself off when Conant moved from it . After the switch 's sharp crack , Kidder heard the banker mutter , " If he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , at least the crazy fool will keep himself busy on the isl ? " Kidder eyed the radiophone for an instant with raised eyebrows , and then shrugged them down again with his shoulders . It was quite evident that Conant had something up his sleeve , but Kidder was n't worried . Who on earth would want to disturb him ? He was n't bothering anybody . He went back to the Neoterics ' building , full of the new power idea . Eleven days later Kidder called Conant and gave specific instructions on how to equip his receiver with a facsimile set which would enable Kidder to send written matter over the air . As soon as this was done and Kidder informed , the biochemist for once in his life spoke at some length . " Conant  --  you implied that a new power source that would be cheaper , more efficient and more easily transmitted than any now in use did not exist . You might be interested in the little generator I have just set up . " It has power , Conant  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beam . Here catch this on the facsimile recorder . " Kidder slipped a sheet of paper under the clips of his transmitter and it appeared on Conant 's set . " Here 's the wiring diagram for a power receiver . Now listen . The beam is so tight , so highly directional , that not three-thousandths of one per cent of the power would be lost in a two-thousand-mile transmission . The power system is closed . That is , any drain on the beam returns a signal along it to the transmitter , which automatically steps up to increase the power output . It has a limit , but it 's way up . And something else . This little gadget of mine can send out eight different beams with a total horsepower output of around eight thousand per minute per beam . From each beam you can draw enough power to turn the page of a book or fly a superstratosphere plane . Hold on  --  I have n't finished yet . Each beam , as I told you before , returns a signal from receiver to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beam , but directs it . Once contact is made , the beam will never let go . It will follow the receiver anywhere . You can power land , air or water vehicles with it , as well as any stationary plant . Like it ? " Conant , who was a banker and not a scientist , wiped his shining pate with the back of his hand and said , " I 've never known you to steer me wrong yet , Kidder . How about the cost of this thing ? " " High , " said Kidder promptly . " As high as an atomic plant . But there are no high-tension lines , no wires , no pipelines , no nothing . The receivers are little more complicated than a radio set . Transmitter is  --  well , that 's quite a job . " " Did n't take you long , " said Conant . " No , " said Kidder , " it did n't , did it ? " It was the lifework of nearly twelve hundred highly cultured people , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the one I have here 's just a model . " Conant 's voice was strained . " A  --  model ? And it delivers ? " " Over sixty-thousand horsepower , " said Kidder gleefully . " Good heavens ! In a full-sized machine  --  why , one transmitter would be enough to ? " The possibilities of the thing choked Conant for a moment . " How is it fueled ? " " It is n't , " said Kidder . " I wo n't begin to explain it . I 've tapped a source of power of unimaginable force . It 's  --  well , big . So big that it ca n't be misused . " " What ? " snapped Conant . " What do you mean by that ? " Kidder cocked an eyebrow . Conant had something up his sleeve , then . At this second indication of it , Kidder , the least suspicious of men , began to put himself on guard . " I mean just what I say , " he said evenly . " Do n't try too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the source of this power is a monstrous resultant caused by the unbalance of two previously equalized forces . Those equalized forces are cosmic in quantity . Actually , the forces are those which make suns , crush atoms the way they crushed those that compose the companion of Sirius . It 's not anything you can fcx ) I with . "  | " I do n't ? " said Conant , and his voice ended puzzledly . " I 'll give you a parallel of it , " said Kidder . " Suppose you take two rods , one in each hand . Place their tips together and push . As long as your pressure is directly along their long axes , the pressure is equalized ; right and left hands cancel each other . Now I come along ; I put out one finger and touch the rods ever so lightly where they come together . They snap out of line violently ; you break a couple of knuckles . The resultant force is at right angles to the original forces you exerted . My power transmitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of energy to throw those forces out of line . Easy enough , when you know how to do it . The important question is whether or not you can control the resultant when you get it . I can . " " I  --  see . " Conant indulged in a four-second gloat . " Heaven help the utility companies . I do n't intend to . Kidder  --  I want a full-size power transmitter . " Kidder clucked into the radiophone . " Ambitious , are n't you ? I have n't a staff out here , Conant  --  you know that . And I ca n't be expected to build four or five thousand tons of apparatus myself . " " I 'll have five hundred engineers and laborers out there in forty-eight hours . " " You will not . Why bother me with it ? I 'm quite happy here , Conant , and one of the reasons is that I 've no one to get in my hair . " " Oh , now , Kidder  --  do n't be like that  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that much money , " said Kidder briskly . He flipped the switch on his set . His switch worked . Conant was furious . He shouted into the phone several times , then began to lean on the signal button . On his island , Kidder let the thing squeal and went hack to his projection room . He was sorry he had sent the diagram of the receiver to Conant . It would have been interesting to power a plane or a car with the model transmitter he had taken from the Neoterics . But if Conant was going to be that way about it  --  well , anyway , the receiver would be no good without the transmitter . Any radio engineer would understand the diagram , but not the beam which activated it . And Conant would n't get his beam . Pity he did n't know Conant well enough . Kidder 's days were endless sorties into learning . He never slept , nor did his Neoterics . He ate regularly every five hours , exercised for half an hour in every twelve . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . Had he wanted to know the date or the year , even , he knew he could get it from ( ' errant . He did n't care , that 's all . The time that was not spent in observation was used in developing new problems for the Neoterics . His thoughts just now ran to defense . The idea was born in his conversation with Conant ; now the idea was primary , its motivation something of no importance . The Neoterics %%e  --  re working on a vibration field of quasi-electrical nature . Kidder could see little practical value in such a thing  --  - an invisible wall which would kill anv living thing sshich touched it . But still  --  the idea was intriguing .  | He stretched and moved away from the telescope in the upper room through which he had been watching his creations at work . He was profoundly happy here in the large control room . Leaving it to go to the old laboratory for a bite to eat was a thing he hated to do . He felt like bidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saying a glad hello when he returned . A little amused at himself , he went out . There was a black blob  --  a distant power boat  --  a few miles off the island , toward the mainland . Kidder stopped and stared distastefully at it . A white petal of spray was affixed to each side of the black body  --  it was coming toward him . He snorted , thinking of the time a yachtload of silly fools had landed out of curiosity one afternoon , spewed themselves over his beloved island , peppered him with lame-brained questions , and thrown his nervous equilibrium out for days . Lord , how he hated people ! The thought of unpleasantness bred two more thoughts that played halfconsciously with his mind as he crossed the compound and entered the old laboratory . One was that perhaps it might be wise to surround his buildings with a field of force of some kind and post warnings for trespassers . The other thought was of Conant and the vague uneasiness the man had been sending to him through the radiophone these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a power plant be built on the island  --  horrible idea ! Conant rose from a laboratory bench as Kidder walked in . They looked at each other wordlessly for a long moment . Kidder had n't seen the bank president in years . The man 's presence , he found , made his scalp crawl . " Hello , " said Conant genially . " You 're looking fit . " Kidder grunted . Conant eased his unwieldy body back onto the bench and said , " Just to save you the energy of asking questions , Mr. Kidder , I arrived two hours ago on a small boat . Rotten way to travel . I wanted to be a surprise to you ; my two men rowed me the last couple of miles . You 're not very well equipped here for defense , are you ? Why , anyone could slip up on you the way I did . " " Who 'd want to ? " growled Kidder . The man 's voice edged annoyingly into his brain . He spoke too loudly for such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears feel that way . Kidder shrugged and went about preparing a light meal for himself . " Well , " drawled the banker . " I might want to . " He drew out a Dow-metal cigar case . " Mind if I smoke ? " " I do , " said Kidder sharply . Conant laughed easily and put the cigars away . " I might , " he said , " want to urge you to let me build that power station on this island . " " Radiophone work ? " " Oh , yes . But now that I 'm here you ca n't switch me off . Now  --  how about it ? "  | " I have n't changed my mind . " " Oh , but you should , Kidder , you should . Think of it  --  think of the good it would do for the masses of people that are now paying exorbitant power bills ! " " I hate the masses ! Why do you have to build here ? " " Oh , that . It 's an ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here without causing any comment whatsoever . The plant would spring full-fledged on the power markets of the country , having been built in secret . The island can be made impregnable . " " I do n't want to be bothered . " " We would n't bother you . We 'd build on the north end of the island  --  a mile and a quarter from you and your work . Ah  --  by the way  --  where 's the model of the power transmitter ? " Kidder , with his mouth full of synthesized food , waved a hand at a small table on which stood the model , a four-foot , amazingly intricate device of plastic and steel and tiny coils . Conant rose and went over to look at it . " Actually works , eh ? " He sighed deeply and said , " Kidder , I really hate to do this , but I want to build that plant rather badly . Carson ! Robbins ! " Two bull-necked individuals stepped out from their hiding places in the corners of the room . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked blankly from one to the other of them . " These gentlemen will follow my orders implicitly , Kidder . In half an hour a party will land here engineers , contractors . They will start surveying the north end of the island for the construction of the power plant . These boys here feel about the same way I do as far as you are concerned . Do we proceed with your cooperation or without it ? It 's immaterial to me whether or not you are left alive to continue your work . My engineers can duplicate your model . " Kidder said nothing . He had stopped chewing when he saw the gunmen , and only now remembered to swallow . He sat crouched over his plate without moving or speaking . Conant broke the silence by walking to the door . " Robbins  --  can you carry that model there ? " The big man put his gun away , lifted the model gently , and nodded . " Take it down to the beach and meet the other boat . Tell Mr. Johansen , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work from . " Robbins went out . Conant turned to Kidder . " There 's no need for us to anger ourselves , " he said oilily . " I think you are stubborn , but I do n't hold it against you . I know how you feel . You 'll be left alone ; you have my promise . But I mean to go ahead on this job , and a small thing like your life ca n't stand in my way . " Kidder said , " Get out of here . " There were two swollen veins throbbing at his temples . His voice was low , and it shook .  | " Very well . Good day , Mr. Kidder . Oh  --  by the way  --  you 're a clever devil . " No one had ever referred to the scholastic Mr. Kidder that way before . " I realize the possibility of your blasting us off the island . I would n't do it if I were you . I 'm willing to give you what you want  --  privacy . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me while I 'm here , the island will be bombed by someone who is working for me . I 'll admit they might fail . If they do , the United States government will take a hand . You would n't want that , would you ? That 's rather a big thing for one man to fight . The same thing goes if the plant is sabotaged in any way after I go back to the mainland . You might be killed . You will most certainly be bothered interminably . Thanks for your .. . er ... cooperation . " The banker smirked and walked out , followed by his taciturn gorilla . Kidder sat there for a long time without moving . Then he shook his head , rested it in his palms . He was badly frightened ; not so much because his life was in danger , but because his privacy and his work  --  his world  --  were threatened . He was hurt and bewildered . He was n't a businessman . He could n't handle men . All his life he had run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was like a frightened child when men closed in on him . Cooling a little , he wondered vaguely what would happen when the power plant opened . Certainly the government would be interested . Unless  --  unless by then Conant was the government . That plant was an unimaginable source of power , and not only the kind of power that turned wheels . He rose and went back to the world that was home to him , a world where his motives were understood , and where there were those who could help him . Back at the Neoterics ' building , he escaped yet again from the world of men into his work . Kidder called Conant the following week , much to the banker 's surprise . His two days on the island had got the work well under way , and he had left with the arrival of a shipload of laborers and material . He kept in close touch by radio with Johansen , the engineer in charge . It had been a blind job for Johansen and all the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources could have hired such a man , or the picked gang with him . Johansen 's first reaction when he saw the model had been ecstatic . He wanted to tell his friends about this marvel ; but the only radio set available was beamed to Conant 's private office in the bank , and Conant 's armed guards , one to every two workers , had strict orders to destroy any other radio transmitter on sight . About that time he realized that he was a prisoner on the island . His instant anger subsided when he reflected that being a prisoner at fifty thousand dollars a week was n't too bad . Two of the laborers and an engineer thought differently , and got disgruntled a couple of days after they arrived . They disappeared one night  --  the same night that five shots were fired down on the beach . No questions were asked , and there was no more trouble .  | Conant covered his surprise at Kidder 's call and was as offensively jovial as ever . " Well , now ! Anything I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kidder . His voice was low , completely without expression . " I want you to issue a warning to your men not to pass the white line I have drawn five hundred yards north of my buildings , right across the island . " " Warning ? Why , my dear fellow , they have orders that you are not to be disturbed on any account . " " You 've ordered them . All right . Now warn them . I have an electric field surrounding my laboratories that will kill anything living which penetrates it . I do n't want to have murder on my conscience . There will be no deaths unless there are trespassers . You 'll inform your workers ? " " Oh , now Kidder , " the banker expostulated . " That was totally unnecessary . You wo n't be bothered . Why ? " But he found he was talking into a dead mike . He knew better than to call back . He called Johansen instead and told him about it . Johansen did n't like the sound of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked that man . He was , for a moment , a little sorry that Johansen would never reach the mainland alive . But that Kidder  --  he was beginning to be a problem . As long as his weapons were strictly defensive he was no real menace . But he would have to be taken care of when the plant was operating . Conant could n't afford to have genius around him unless it was unquestionably on his side . The power transmitter and Conant 's highly ambitious plans would be safe as long as Kidder was left to himself . Kidder knew that he could , for the time being , expect more sympathetic treatment from Conant than he could from a horde of government investigators . Kidder only left his own enclosure once after the work began on the north end of the island , and it took all of his unskilled diplomacy to do it . Knowing the source of the plant 's power , knowing what could happen if it were misused , he asked Conant 's permission to inspect the great transmitter when it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report back to Conant until he was safe within his own laboratory again , he turned off his shield and walked up to the north end . He saw an awe-inspiring sight . The four-foot model was duplicated nearly a hundred times as large . Inside a massive three-hundred-foot tower a space was packed nearly solid with the same bewildering maze of coils and bars that the Neoterics had built so delicately into their machine . At the top was a globe of polished golden alloy , the transmitting antenna . From it would stream thousands of tight beams of force , which could be tapped to any degree by corresponding thousands of receivers placed anywhere at any distance . Kidder learned that the receivers had already been built , but his informant , Johansen , knew little about that end of ' it and was saying less . Kidder checked over every detail oI the structure , and when he was through he shook Johansen 's hand admiringly.  | " I did n't want this thing here , " he said shyly , " and I do n't . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind of work . " " It 's a pleasure to meet the man that invented it . " Kidder beamed . " I did n't invent it , " he said . " Maybe some day I 'll show you who did . I  --  well , good-by . " He turned before he had a chance to say too much and marched off down the path . " Shall I ? " said a voice at Johansen 's side . One of Conant 's guards had his gun out . Johansen knocked the man 's arm down . " No . " He scratched his head . " So that 's the mysterious menace from the other end of the island . Eh ! Why , he 's a hell of a nice little feller ! " Built on the ruins of Denver , which was destroyed in the great Battle of the Rockies during the Western War , stands the most beautiful city in the world ? our nation 's capital . New Washington . In a circular room deep in the heart of the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat . Under the president 's desk a dictaphone unostentatiously recorded every word that was said . Two thousand and more miles away , Conant hung over a radio receiver , tuned to receive the signals of the tiny transmitter in the civilian 's side pocket . One of the officers spoke . " Mr. President , the impossible claims ' made for this gentleman 's product are absolutely true . He has proved beyond doubt each item on his prospectus . " The president glanced at the civilian , back at the officer . " I wo n't wait for your report , " he said . " Tell me  --  what happened ? " Another of the army men mopped his face with a khaki bandanna . " I ca n't ask you to believe us , Mr. President , but it 's true all the same . Mr. Wright here has in his suitcase three or four dozen small . . . er . . . bombs ? " " They 're not bombs , " said Wright casually . " All right . They 're not bombs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sledge hammer . There was no result . He put two more in an electric furnace . They burned away like so much tin and cardboard . We dropped one down the barrel of a field piece and fired it . Still nothing . " He paused and looked at the third officer , who picked up the account : " We really got started then . We flew to the proving grounds , dropped one of the objects and flew to thirty thousand feet . From there , with a small hand detonator no bigger than your fist , Mr. Wright set the thing off . I 've never seen anything like it . Forty acres of land came straight up at us , breaking up , as it came . The concussion was terrific  --  you must have felt it here , four hundred miles away . " The president nodded . " I did . Seismographs on the other side of the Earth picked it up . " " The crater it left was a quarter of a mile deep at the center . Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city ! There is n't even any necessity for accuracy ! " " You have n't heard anything yet , " another officer broke in . " Mr. Wright 's automobile is powered by a small plant similar to the others . He demonstrated it to us . We could find no fuel tank of any kind , or any other driving mechanism . But with a power plant no bigger than six cubic inches , that car , carrying enough weight to give it traction , outpulled an army tank ! " " And the other test ! " said the third excitedly . " He put one of the objects into a replica of a treasury vault . The walls were twelve feet thick , superreinforced concrete . He controlled it from over a hundred yards away . He .. . he burst that vault ! It was n't an explosion  --  it was as if some incredibly powerful expansive force inside filled it and flattened the walls from inside . They cracked and split and powdered , and the steel girders and rods came twisting and shearing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he insisted on seeing you . We knew it was n't usual , but he said he has more to say and would say it only in your presence . " The president said gravely , " What is it , Mr. Wright ? " Wright rose , picked up his suitcase , opened it and took out a small cube , about eight inches on a side , made of some light-absorbent red material . Four men edged nervously away from it . " These gentlemen , " he began , " have seen only part of the things this device can do . I 'm going to demonstrate to you the delicacy of control that is possible with it . " He made an adjustment with a tiny knob on the side of the cube , set it on the edge of the president 's desk . " You have asked me more than once if this is my invention or if I am representing someone . The latter is true . It might also interest you to know that the man who controls this cube is right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can prevent it from detonating now that I ? " He pulled his detonator out of the suitcase and pressed a button ? " have done this . It will explode the way the one we dropped from the plane did , completely destroying this city and everything in it , in just four hours . It will also explode ? " He stepped back and threw a tiny switch on his detonator ? " if any moving object comes within three feet of it or if anyone leaves this room but me  --  it can be compensated for that . If , after I leave , I am molested , it will detonate as soon as a hand is laid on me . No bullets can kill me fast enough to prevent me from setting it off . " The three army men were silent . One of them swiped nervously at the beads of cold sweat on his forehead . The others did not move . The president said evenly : " What 's your proposition ? " " A very reasonable one . My employer does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wants is your agreement to carry out his orders ; to appoint the  | cabinet members he chooses , to throw your influence in any way he dictates . The public  --  Congress  --  anyone else  --  need never know anything about it . I might add that if you agree to this proposal , this bomb , ' as you call it , will not go off . But you can be sure that thousands of them are planted all over the country . You will never know when you are near one . If you disobey , it means instant annihilation for you and everyone else within three or four square miles . " In three hours and fifty minutes  --  that will be at precisely seven o'clock ? there is a commercial radio program on Station RPRS . You will cause the announcer , after his station identification , to say Agreed . ' It will pass unnoticed by all but my employer . There is no use in having me followed ; my work is done . I shall never see nor contact my employer again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wright closed his suitcase with a businesslike snap , bowed , and left the room . Four men sat staring at the little red cube . " Do you think he can do all he says ? " asked the president . The three nodded mutely . The president reached for his phone . There was an eavesdropper to all of the foregoing . Conant , squatting behind his great desk in the vault , where he had his sanctum sanctorum , knew nothing of it . But beside him was the compact bulk of Kidder 's radiophone . His presence switched it on , and Kidder , on his island , blessed the day he had thought of that device . He had been meaning to call Conant all morning , but was very hesitant . His meeting with the young engineer Johansen had impressed him strongly . The man was such a thorough scientist , possessed of such complete delight in the work he did , that for the first time in his life Kidder found himself actually wanting to see someone again . But he feared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for Johansen 's work was done on the island , and Conant would most certainly have the engineer killed if he heard of his visit , fearing that Kidder would influence him to sabotage the great transmitter . And if Kidder went to the power plant he would probably be shot on sight . All one day Kidder wrangled with himself , and finally determined to call Conant . Fortunately he gave no signal , but turned up the volume on the receiver when the little red light told him that Conant 's transmitter was functioning . Curious , he heard everything that occurred in the president 's chamber three thousand miles away . Horrified , he realized what Conant 's engineers had done . Built into tiny containers were tens of thousands of power receivers . They had no power of their own , but , by remote control , could draw on any or all of the billions of horsepower the huge plant on the island was broadcasting . Kidder stood in front of his receiver , speechless . There was nothing he could do . If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government would certainly step in and take over the island , and then  --  what would happen to him and his precious Neoterics ?  | Another sound grated out of the receiver  --  a commercial radio program . A few bars of music , a man 's voice advertising stratoline fares on the installment plan , a short silence , then : " Station RPRS , voice of the nation 's Capital , District of South Colorado . " The three-second pause was interminable . " The time is exactly . . . er . . . agreed . The time is exactly seven P.M. , Mountain Standard Time . " Then came a half-insane chuckle . Kidder had difficulty believing it was Conant . A phone clicked . The banker 's voice : " Bill ? All set . Get out there with your squadron and bomb up the island . Keep away from the plant , but cut the rest of it to ribbons . Do it quick and get out of there . " Almost hysterical with fear , Kidder rushed about the room and then shot out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred innocent workmen in barracks a quarter mile from the plant . Conant did n't need them now , and he did n't need Kidder . The only safety for anyone was in the plant itself , and Kidder would n't leave his Neoterics to be bombed . He flung himself up the stairs and to the nearest teletype . He banged out , " Get me a defense . I want an impenetrable shield . Urgent ! " The words ripped out from under his fingers in the functional script of the Neoterics . Kidder did n't think of what he wrote , did n't really visualize the thing he ordered . But he had done what he could . He 'd have to leave them now , get to the barracks ; warn those men . He ran up the path toward the plant , flung himself over the white line that marked death to those who crossed it . A squadron of nine clip-winged , mosquito-nosed planes rose out of a cove on the mainland . There was no sound from the engines , for there were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drew its unmarked , lightabsorbent wings through the air with power from the island . In a matter of minutes they raised the island . The squadron leader spoke briskly into a microphone . " Take the barracks first . Clean ' em up . Then work south . " Johansen was alone on a small hill near the center of the island . He carried a camera , and though he knew pretty well that his chances of ever getting ashore again were practically nonexistent , he liked angle shots of his tower , and took innumerable pictures . The first he knew of the planes was when he heard their whining dive over the barracks . He stood transfixed , saw a shower of bombs hurtle down and turn the barracks into a smashed ruin of broken wood , metal and bodies . The picture of Kidder 's earnest face flashed into his mind . Poor little guy  --  if they ever bombed his end of the island he would  --  But his tower ! Were they going to bomb the plant ? Ile ? ate bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cut back and  | dove again . They seemed to be working south . At the third dive he was sure of it . Not knowing what he could do , he nevertheless turned and ran toward Kidder 's place . He rounded a turn in the trail and collided violently with the little biochemist . Kidder 's face was scarlet with exertion , and he was the most terrified-looking object Johansen had ever seen . Kidder waved a hand northward . " Conant ! " he screamed over the uproar . " It 's Conant ! He 's going to kill us all ! " " The plant ? " said Johansen , turning pale . " It 's safe . He wo n't touch that ! But . . . my place . . . what about all those men ? " " Too late ! " shouted Johansen . " Maybe I can ? Come on ! " called Kidder , and was off down the trail , heading south . Johansen pounded after him . Kidder 's little short legs became a blur as the squadron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had met . As they burst out of the woods , Johansen put on a spurt , caught up with the scientist and knocked him sprawling not six feet from the whiteline . " Wh ... wh ? " " Do n't go any farther , you fool ! Your own damned force field  --  it 'll kill you ! " " Force field ? But  --  I came through it on the way up  --  Here . Wait . If I can ? " Kidder began hunting furiously about in the grass . In a few seconds he ran up to the line , clutching a large grasshopper in his hand . He tossed it over . It lay still . " See ? " said Johansen . " It ? " " Look ! It jumped ! Come on ! I do n't know what went wrong , unless the Neoterics shut it off . They generated that field  --  I did n't . " " Neo  --  huh ? " " Never mind , " snapped the biochemist , and ran . They pounded gasping up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clapped his eyes to a telescope and shrieked in glee . " They 've done it ! They 've done it ! " " Who 's ? " " My little people ! The Neoterics ! They 've made the impenetrable shield ! Do n't you see  --  it cut through the lines of force that start up that field out there . Their generator is still throwing it up , but the vibrations ca n't get out ! They 're safe ! They 're safe ! " And the overwrought hermit began to cry . Johansen looked at him pityingly and shook his head . " Sure  --  your little men are all right . But we are n't , " he added as the floor shook to the detonation of a bomb . Johansen closed his eyes , got a grip on himself and let his curiosity overcome his ear . Ile stepped to the binocular telescope , gaffed down it . There was  | nothing there but a curved sheet of gray material . He had never seen a gray quite like that . It was absolutely neutral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem hard , and to look at it made his brain reel . He looked up . Kidder was pounding the keys of a teletype , watching the blank yellow tape anxiously . " I 'm not getting through to them , " he whimpered . " I do n't know what 's the mat  --  Oh , of course ! " " What ? " " The shield is absolutely impenetrable ! The teletype impulses ca n't get through or I could get them to extend the screen over the building  --  over the whole island ! There 's nothing those people ca n't do ! " " He 's crazy , " Johansen muttered . " Poor little ? " The teletype began clicking sharply . Kidder dove at it , practically embraced it . He read off the tape as it came out . Johansen saw the characters , but they meant nothing to him . " Almighty , " Kidder read falteringly , " pray have mercy on us and be forebearing until we have said our say . Without orders we have lowered the screen you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great one . Our screen is truly impenetrable , and so cut off your words on the word machine . We have never , in the memory of any Neoteric , been without your word before . Forgive us our action . We will eagerly await your answer . " Kidder 's fingers danced over the keys . " You can look now , " he gasped . " Go on  --  the telescope ! " Johansen , trying to ignore the whine of sure death from above , looked . He saw what looked like land  --  fantastic fields under cultivation , a settlement of some sort , factories , and  --  beings . Everything moved with incredible rapidity . He could n't see one of the inhabitants except as darting pinky-white streaks . Fascinated , he stared for a long minute . A sound behind him made him whirl . It was Kidder , rubbing his hands together briskly . There was a broad smile on his face . " They did it , " he said happily . " You see ? " Johansen did n't see until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside . He ran to a window . It was night outside  --  the  --  blackest night  --  when it should have been dusk . " What happened ? " " The Neoterics , " said Kidder , and laughed like a child . " My friends downstairs there . They threw up the impenetrable shield over the whole island . We a n't be touched now ! " And at Johansen 's amazed questions , he launched into a description of the ray e of beings below them . Outside the shell , things happened . Nine airplanes suddenly went dead-stick . Nine pilots glided downward , powerless , and some fell into the sea , and some  | struck the miraculous gray shell that loomed in place of an island ; slid off and sank . And ashore , a man named Wright sat in a car half dead with fear , while government men surrounded him , approached cautiously , daring instant death from a now-dead source . In a room deep in the White House , a high-ranking army officer shrieked , " I ca n't stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaped up , snatched a red cube off the president 's desk , ground it to ineffectual litter under his shining boots . And in a few days they took a broken old man away from the bank and put him in an asylum , where he died within a week . The shield , you see , was truly impenetrable . The power plant was untouched and sent out its beams ; but the beams could not get out , and anything powered from the plant went dead . The story never became public , although for some years there was heightened naval activity off the New England coast . The navy , so the story went , had a new target range out there  --  a great hemiovoid of gray material . They bombed it and shelled it and rayed it and blasted all around it , but never even dented its smooth surface . Kidder and Johansen let it stay there . They were happy enough with their researches and their Neoterics . They did not hear or feel the shelling , for the shield was truly impenetrable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the materials at hand , and they simply did n't care . They were the only survivors of the bombing , with the exception of three poor maimed devils who died soon afterward . All this happened many years ago , and Kidder and Johansen may be alive today , and they may be dead . But that does n't matter too much . The important thing is that the great gray shell will bear watching . Men die , but races live . Some day the Neoterics , after innumerable generations of inconceivable advancement , will take down their shield and come forth . When I think of that I feel frightened .  | More early don't-give-a-damn fun ; actually a lampoon on some of the more dreadful contemporary ( 1940 ) examples of science fiction . So come on and meet Satan Strong , Scourge of the Spaceways , Supporter of the Serialized Short Story , and Specialist in Science On The Spot . Dr. Bjornsen ws a thorough man . He thought that way and acted that way and expected others to exceed him in thoroughness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicious disappointment in incompetents , and took delight in pointing out the erring one 's shortcomings . He was in an ideal position for this sort of thing , being principal of the Nudnick Institute . Endowed by Professor Thaddeus MacIlhainy Nudnick , the institute was conducted for the purpose of supplying brilliant young assistants to Professor Nudnick . It enrolled two thousand students every year , and the top three of the graduating class were given subsistence and a considerable salary for the privilege of entering Nudnick 's eight-year secondary course , where they underwent some real study before they began as assistants in the Nudnick laboratories . Bjornsen never congratulated an honor student , for they had behaved as expected . He found many an opportunity of delivering a kick or two in the slats of those who had fallen by the wayside ; and of these opportunities , the ones that pleased him the most were the ones involving expulsion . He considered himself an expert disciplinarian , and he was more than proud of his forte for invective . It was with pleasurable anticipation that he summoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hughie was a second-year student , and made ideal bait for Bjornsen 's particular line of attack . The kid was intelligent to a degree , and fairly well read , so that he could understand Bjornsen 's more subtle insults . He was highly sensitive , so that he could be hurt by what Bjornsen said , and he showed it . He lacked sense , so that he continually retorted to Bjornsen 's comments , giving the principal blurted statements to pick meticulously apart while the victim writhed . Hughie was such perfect material for persecution that Bjornsen rather hated to expel him ; but he comforted himself by recalling the fact that there were hundreds of others who could be made to squirm . He 'd take his time with Hughie , however ; stretch it out , savor the boy 's suffering before he kicked him out of the school . " Send him in , " Bjornsen told the built-in communicator on his luxurious desk . He leaned back in his chair , put the tips of his fingers together , lowered his head so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared through his shaggy brows at the door , and waited . Hughie came in , his hair plastered unwillingly down , his fear and resentment sticking out all over him . The kid 's knees knocked together so that he stumbled against the doorpost . There was a gloss of cold sweat on his forehead . From previous experience , he had no difficulty in taking up the front-and-center position before the principal 's desk . " Y-yes sir ! " Bjornsen made a kissing noise with his wrinkled lips before he spoke , threw back his head and glared . " You might , " he said quietly , " have washed your ears before you came in here . " He knew that there is no more painfully undignified attack for an adolescent , particularly if it is not true . Hughie flushed and stuck out his lower lip . Bjornsen said , " You are an insult to this institution . You were in a position , certainly , to know yourself before you applied for admission ; therefore , the very act of applying was dishonest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfit even to enter these buildings , to say nothing of daring to perpetuate the mistake of the board of examiners in staying here . I am thoroughly disgusted with you . " Bjornsen smiled his disgust , and it was a smile that perfectly matched his words . He bent to flip the switch on the communicator , cutting off its mellow buzz . " Yes ? " " Dr. Bjornsen ! Professor Nudnick is ? " The annunciator 's hollow voice was drowned out in the crashing of a hard , old foot against the door . Nudnick kicked it open because he knew it could not be slammed , and he liked startling Biornsen . " What sort of nonsense is this ? " he demanded , in a voice that sounded like flatulence through ten feet of lead pipe . " Since when has that vinegar-visaged female out there been instructed to announce me ? Damn it , you 'll see me whether you 're busy or not ! " Bjornsen had bounced out of his chair to indulge in every sort of sycophant- ism short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you ! " This was perfect . The only thing that could possibly increase Hughie McCauley 's agony was to have an audience to his dismissal ; and what better audience could he have than the great endower of the school himself ? Bjornsen rubbed his hands , which yielded an unpleasant dry sound , and began . " Professor Nudnick , " he said , catching Hughie 's trembling shoulder and using it to thrust the attached boy between him and Nudnick , " you could not have picked a better time to arrive . This shivering example of negation is typical of the trash that has been getting by the examiners recently . Now I may prove to you that my recent letter on the subject was justified . " Nudnick looked calmly at Hughie . " I do n't read your letters , " he said . " They bore me . What 's he done ? " Bjornsen , a little taken aback , put this new resentment into his words . " Done ? What he has n't done is more important . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reading imaginative fiction during his hours of relaxation instead of reading books pertaining in some way to his studies . He whistles in corridors . He asks impertinent questions of his instructors . He was actually discovered writing a letter to a . . . a girl ! " " Tsk , tsk , " chuckled the professor . " This during classes ? " " Certainly not ! Even he would not go that far , though I expect it hourly . " " Hm-m-m . Is he intelligent ? " " Not very . " " What kind of questions does he ask ? " " Oh  --  stupid ones . About the nature of a space-warp , whatever that may be , and about whether or not time travel is possible . A dreamer  --  that 's what he is , and a scientific institution is no place for dreamers . " " What are you going to do with him ? " " Expel him , of course . " Nudnick reached over and pulled the boy out of Bjornsen 's claw . " Then why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It so happens , Bjornsen , that this is just the kind of boy I came here to get . I 'm going to take him with me on a trip to the Asteroid Belt . Salary at two thousand a month , if he 's willing . Are you , what's-your-name ? " Hughie nodded swimmingly . " Eh . " Beckoning the boy , Nudnick started for the door . " My advice to you , Bjornsen , " grated the scientist , " is as follows . Keep your nose out of the students ' lives on their off hours . If you must continue in these little habits of yours , take it out in pulling the wings off flies . And get married . Take this advice or hand in your resignation effective this date next month . " Ilughie paused at the door , looking hack . Nudnick gave him a quick look , slim ed him toward Bjornsen. " ( ; o ahead , kid . I 'd like it , too . "  | Hughie grinned , walked up to Bjornsen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cake of ice . They were eight days out now , and these were the eight : The day when the unpredictable Professor Nudnick had whisked Hughie up to his mountain laboratory , and had put him to work loading the last of an astonishingly inclusive list of stores into the good ship Stou fella . Hughie began to regard the professor as a little less than the god he had imagined , and a little more as a human being . The old man was perpetually cheerful , pointing out Hughie 's stupidities and his little triumphs without differentiating between them . He treated Hughie with a happy tolerance , and seemed to be more delighted with the lad 's ignorance than by his comparatively meager knowledge . When Hughie had haltingly asked if he might take a suitcase full of fiction with him , Nudnick had chuckled dryly and sent him off to the nearest town with a pocketful of money . Hughie arrived back at the laboratory laden and blissful . They took off . And the day when they heard the last broadcast news report before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . was one to the effect that Dr. Emil Bjornsen , principal of the Nudnick Institute , had resigned to accept a government job . Hughie had laughed gleefully at this , but Nudnick shook his shaggy old head . " Not funny , Hughie , " he said . " Bjornsen 's a shrewd man . I 've an idea why he did that , and it has nothing to do with my ... our .. . ultimatum . " Struck by the scientist 's sober tone , Hughie calmed down to ask , " What did he do it for ? " Nudnick clapped a perforated course card into the automatic pilot , reeled its lower edge into the integrator , and checked his controls before switching them over to the " Iron Mike . " " It has to do with this trip , " he said , waving the kid into the opposite seat , " and it 's about time you knew what this is all about . What we 're after is a mineral deposit of incalculable value . How it is , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there " ? he indicated the Asteroid Belt ? " is a freak . It 's a lump like the rest of the asteroids , but it differs from the rest of them . It must 've been a wanderer , drifting heaven alone knows how far in space until it got caught in the Belt . It 's almost pure , through and through  --  an oxide of prosydium . That mean anything to you ? " Hughie pushed a couple of freckles together over his nose . " Yeah . Rare Earth element . Used for . . . lessee . . . something to do with Nudnick Metal , is n't it ? " " That 's right : Do you know what Nudnick Metal is ? " " No . Far as I know it 's a trade secret , known only to the workers in the Isopolis Laboratories . " The Isopolis Laboratories were half heaven and half prison . By government grant , the great Nudnick plant there turned out the  | expensive metal . It was manned by workers who would never again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to , for everything they could possibly want was supplied them . There was no secret about the way they lived , nor about anything in the fifty-square-mile enclosure except the process itself . " Nudnick 's Metal is a synthetic element , thousands of times denser than anything else known . That 's about all I remember , " Hughie finished lamely . Nudnick chuckled . " I ' 11 let you in on it . The metal is the ideal substance for coating spaceships , because it 's as near being impenetrable as anything in the Universe . This ship , for instance , is coated with a layer of the stuff less than one **29;237;TOOLONG of an inch thick , and yet is protected against practically anything . We could run full tilt into an object the size of Earth , and though the impact would drill a molten hole thirty miles deep and most likely kill us a little bit , the hull would n't even be scratched . Heh . Want to know what Nudnick Metal is ? I 'll tell you . Copper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Copper ? But what makes it  --  How is it ? " " Easy enough . You know , Hughie , it 's the simple things that are really effective . Try to remember that . Nudnick Metal is collapsed copper ; collapsed in the way that the elements of the companions of Sirius and Procyon are collapsed . You know the analogy  --  pile wine-glasses into a barrel , and there 'll he a definite , small number of glasses that can be packed in . But crush them to tine powder , and then start packing . The barrel will hold thousands upon thousands more . The molecules of Nudnick Metal are crushed that way . You could build four hundred ships this size , from stem to stern of solid copper , and you 'd use less copper than that which was used to coat this hull . " The process is only guessed at because copper is synthesized from the uranium we ship into Isopolis ostensibly for power . As you just said , it is known that we import prosydium . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the nature of the process . But prosydium is n't an ingredient . It 's more like a catalyst . Of all the elements , only prosydium can , by its atomic disintegration , absorb the unbelievable heat liberated by the collapse of the copper molecules . I wo n't go into the details of it , but the energy thus absorbed and transmuted can be turned back to hasten the collapsing process . The tough thing about prosydium is that it 's as rare as a hairy egg , and so far no one 's been able to synthesize it in usable quantities . All of which makes Nudnick Metal a trifle on the expensive side . This lump of prosydium in the Belt will cut the manufacturing cost way down , and the man or concern or planet that gets hold of it can write his  --  its  --  own ticket . See ? " " I will , " said I lughie slowly , " if you 'll say all that over again a few thousand times a day for the next couple of years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confiding in him . Though he himself was not qualified to use it , hr knew that the infimnation he had just received was worth countless millions  | in the right quarters . It frightened him a little . He wanted to keep the old man talking , and so reached for a question . " Why do we have to sneak out in a little ship like this ? Why not take a flotilla of destroyers from Earth and take possession ? " " Ca n't do things that way , son . The Joint Patrol puts the kibosh on that . You can blame the jolly old idealism of the Interplanetary Peace Congress for that , and the Equal Armament Amendment . You see , Mars and Earth are forced by mutual agreement to maintain absolutely equal armament , to share all new developments and to police space with a Joint Patrol . A flotilla of Earth ships taking off without the knowledge or consent of the Patrol constitutes an act of war . War is a nasty business for a lot of people who were n't in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if I turn over the location of my find to the Patrol , it becomes the property of the Joint Patrol , neatly tied up in red tape , and it does n't do anybody any good  --  particularly the Nudnick Laboratories . However  --  here 's where we come in . " If an independent expedition lands on , or takes in tow , any body in space that is not the satellite of a planet , said body becomes the sole property of that expedition . Therefore , I 've got to keep this expedition as secret from Earth as from Mars , so that Earth  --  and Nudnick  --  can get the ultimate benefit . In two months my little treasure will be in opposition with Earth . If I have taken it in tow by then , I can announce my discovery by ultraradio . The signal reaches Earth before it reaches Mars ; by the time the little red men can send out a pirate to erase me , I am surrounded by a Patrol Fleet , and quite safe . But if Mars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are going to be intercepted , followed , and rubbed out for the glory and profit of the red planet . Get it ? " " I get it . But what 's all this got to do with Bjornsen ? " The old scientist scratched his nose . " I do n't know . Bjornsen 's a most peculiar egg , Hughie . He worked most of his life to get to be principal of the institute , and it seems to me he did n't do it just for the salary and prestige attached . More than once that egocentric martinet tried to pump me for information about what I was doing , about the Nudnick Metal process , about a hundred things of the sort . I 'm sure he has n't got any real information , but he might possibly have a hunch . A good hunch is plenty to put a Martian ship on our tail and a lot of money in Bjornsen 's pocket . We 'll see . " And then there was the day when Hughie had made bold enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he had his choice of thousands upon thousands of other assistants . Nudnick unwrapped his white teeth in one of his indescribable grins . " Lots of reasons , son , among which are the fact that I delight in displeasing the contents of Bjornsen 's stuffed shirt , and the fact that I dislike being bored , and since I must make this trip myself , I might as well be amused while I am  | cooped up . Also , I have found that baby geniuses are inclined to be a little cocky about what they know , and the fact that they knew it at such a tender age . A trained assistant , on the other hand , is almost certain to be a specialist of sorts , and specialists have inflexible and dogmatic minds . Bjornsen said that one of your cardinal crimes was that you relaxed in fantasy . I , with all of my scientific savvy , can find it in me to admire a mind which can conceive of the possibility of a space-warp , or time-travel . Do n't look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't possibly imagine such a thing  --  my mind is far too cluttered up with facts . I do n't know whether or not a Martian ship will pick up our trail on this trip . If one does , it will take fantastic thinking to duck him . I 'm incapable of thinking that way , so it 's up to you . " Hughie , hearing the old man 's voice , watching his eyes as he spoke , recognized the sincerity there , and began to realize that he carried an unimaginable responsibility on his shoulders . On the fourth and fifth days out , there was little to do and Hughie amused both of them by reading aloud , at Nudnick 's insistence , from some of his store of books and magazines . At first Hughie was diffident ; he could not believe that Nudnick , who had so outdone any fictional scientist , could be genuinely interested ; but Nudnick put it as an order , and Hughie began to read , with many a glance at the old man to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He found difficulty in controlling his voice and his saliva until Nudnick slowed him down . Soon he was lost in the yarn . It was a good one . It concerned one Satan Strong , Scientist , Scourge of the Spaceways and Supporter of the Serialized Short Story . Satan was a bad egg whose criminality vas surpassed only by his forte for Science on the Spot . Pursued particularly by the Earth sections of the Space Patrol , Satan Strong was always succeeding in the most dastardly deeds , which always turned out to be preliminaries to greater evils which were always thwarted by the quick thinking of Captain Jaundess of the Patrol , following which , by " turning to the micro-ultraphiltmeter lic rapidly tore out a dozen connections , spot-welded twenty-seven busbars , and converted the machine into an improved von Krockmeier hyperspace lever , which bent space like the blade of a rapier and hurtled him in a flash from hilt to point " and effected his escape until the next issue . Nudnick was entranced . " It 's pseudoscience , " he chuckled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , it 's lovely ! " He regarded his withered frame quizzically . " Pity I do n't have muscles and a widow 's peak , " he said . " I 've got the science hut I rather fear I lack glamour . Have you the next issue ? " f lughic had . ' then , on the sixth day , Hughie 's reading was interrupted by a shrill whine L from the forward instrument panel . A light flashed under a screen ; Nudnick s. , Iked over to it and flipped a switch . The screen glowed , showing the Ida ( kites .. of space and its crystal points of light . He turned a knob ; the points  | of light swung slowly across the screen until the tiny black ring at the juncture of the crosshairs encircled a slightly luminous spot . " What is it ? " Hughie asked , regretfully laying down his book . " Company , " said Nudnick tersely . " No telling who it is at this distance , unless they want to tell us about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and overtaking . " Hughie stared into the screen . " You had this stern detector running all the time , did n't you ? Gee  --  You do n't think it 's a pirate , do you ? " There was something hopeful in Hughie 's tone . Nudnick laughed . " You want to see science in action , do n't you ? Heh . I 'm afraid I 'm going to be a disappointment to you , youngster . We ca n't travel any faster than we are going now , and that ship quite obviously can . " Hughie flushed . " Well , professor , if you think it 's all right ? " Nudnick shook his head . " I do n't think it 's all right , " he said . " Now that we have established that fact , let 's get back to your story . To think that Captain Juandess would be careless enough to let his betrothed get into the clutches of that evil fellow ! What will he do to her ? " " But , Professor Nudnick ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the control room to his chair . " My dear , overanxious young crew , the ship that is pursuing us presents no problem until it overtakes us . That will be in forty-eight hours . In the meantime , Captain Jaundess ' girl friend is in far greater danger than we are . Pray proceed . " Most unwillingly , Hughie read on . Forty-eight hours later , the brisk crackle of an ultraradio ordered them to stand by to be boarded in the name of the Joint Patrol . The destroyer pulled alongside , and a lifeboat carried a slim , strong cable around the Stoutfella and , through the mooring eyes , back to the Patrol ship . The cable was used because magnetic grapples are useless on a Nudnick Metal hull . A winch drew the craft together , and a " wind tunnel " boarding stage groped against the outside of the Stou fella 's air lock . " What are you going to do ? " asked Hughie desperately . " We are going to say as little as possible , " said Nudnick meaningly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . " He actuated the air-lock controls ; the boarding stage was hermetically sealed to their hull as the outer and inner doors slid back . A purple-uniformed Martian yeoman stepped down into the room , followed by his equally ranking shipmate from Earth . The Martian swore and shut his nostril flaps on the sides of his stringy neck with an unpleasant click . " This air is saturated , " he squeaked . " You might have had the courtesy to dehydrate it . " " What ? " grinned the Earth Patrolman . " And deprive me of the only breath  | of decent air I 've had in nineteen days ? " He drew a grateful breath , letting the moisture sink into his half-parched lungs . The air in Patrol ships was always , since there was no happy medium , too dry for Earthlings and too humid for Martians ; for the Martians , living for countless generations on a water-starved planet had developed a water-hoarding metabolism which had never evolved a use for a water surplus . " Who is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Martian immediately turned his back on Hughie . " We have orders from headquarters that this ship is to be searched and disarmed according to Section 398 of the Earth-Mars Code . " " Suspicion of piracy , " supplemented the Earthman . " Piracy ? " shouted Hughie , his resentment at last breaking through . " Piracy ? Who do you think you are ? What do you mean by ? " Three tiny eyes in the back of the Martian 's head flipped open . " Has this unpleasantly noisy infant a function ? " he demanded , fingering the blaster at his hip . " He 's my crew . Be quiet , Hughie . " " Yeah  --  take it easy , kiddo , " said the Earthman , not unkindly . " Orders are orders in this outfit . You got no fight with us . We just work here . " " Let them alone , Hughie , " chimed in Nudnick . " We 've little enough armament and they 're welcome to it . They have every right . " While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Patrolman . " This is a Patrol Council order ? " " Of course . " " Who signed it ? " " Councilman Emil Bjornsen . " " Bjornsen ? The new member ? How has he the right ? " " Council regulations . If any matter should be put to a vote , the resulting decision shall be executed in the name of the president of the council , except in such cases where the decision is carried by one vote , when the order shall be executed in the name of the councilman whose vote carried the measure . ' Bjornsen , as the most recently appointed councilman , has the last vote . In this case the action was deadlocked and his vote carried it . " " I see . Thank you . I suppose you ca n't tell me who proposed this order ? " " Sorry . " The Patrolman moved swiftly about the room , covering every inch of space . In spite of his resentment , Hughie had to admire the man 's efficiency . The kid stood sullenly against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ran his hands quickly over the boy , and with the skill of a practiced " dip , " extracted a low-powered pellet-gun from I lughie 's side pocket . " You wo n't want this , " he sail . " It wo n't kill anything but cockroaches , and they 're too easily fumigated. "  | Glancing around swiftly to see if the Martian had returned from the storerooms yet , he clapped his hand over Hughie 's mouth and whispered something . When the Martian came back , the patrolman was finishing up on the other side of the room , and Hughie was staring at him with an affectionately resentful ) wonderment . " Hardly a thing , " complained the Martian shrilly , displaying a sparse armload of side arms and one neuro ray bow chaser . " Never heard of a Martian councilman sending a destroyer after a couple of nitwits on a pleasure cruise . " They saluted and left . In two minutes the ships drifted apart ; in five , the destroyer was nothing but a memory and a dwindling spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tsk ! You certainly flew off the handle , Hughie . When that fellow took away your peashooter , I thought you were going to bite him . " " Nah , " said Hughie embarrassed . " He was O.K. I guess I did n't want the gun much anyhow . " There was a silence , while Nudnick inspected the inner air-lock gate and then the air-pressure indicator . Finally Nudnick asked : " Well , are n't you going to tell me ? " " What ? " " What it was that the patrolman whispered in your ear . Or are you going to save it for a climax in the best science-fiction tradition ? " Hughie was saving it for just that . " You do n't miss much do you ? " he said . " It was n't nothing much . He said , There 's a lousy little Martian private ship on your tail . Probably will stay on our spot on your visiscreen for a few days and be on top of you before you know it . Better watch him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen . " Anything else ? " He spoke as if he knew damn well there was something else . Hughie blushed , robbed of the choicest part of his secret . " Only just that Bjornsen 's aboard . " " That still is n't all . " Nudnick approached the boy , absolutely dead pan . " Honest , " stammered Hughie , wide-eyed . Nudnick shook his head , put his hand in his pocket , gave something to Hughie . " There 's just this , " he said . " He slipped it into my pocket on the way out , just as easily as he slipped it out of yours . " Hughie stared at the gun in his hand with a delight approaching tears . " A very efficient young man , " said Nudnick . " You will notice that he unloaded it . " Three weeks later professor Nudnick took it upon himself to disconnect the stern visiscreen because Hughie could not pry himself loose from it . The patrolman had been right ; the destroyer had dwindled there until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several days , after which it had grown again until the boy could make out the ship itself . It was no longer  | the destroyer , it was a plump-lined wicked little Martian sportster . He knew without asking that the little ship was fast and maneuverable beyond all comparison with the Stoutfella . It annoyed him almost as much as Nudnick 's calm acceptance of the fact that they were being followed , and that there was every possibility of their never returning to Earth , to say nothing of locating and claiming the prosydium asteroid . He took the trouble to say as much . Nudnick merely raised his eyebrows to uncover his logic and said : " Do n't go off half-cocked , younker . Granted , the Martian is following us . I was apparently right about Bjornsen 's hunch ; he knows that I have been looking all over the System for prosydium and that it is rather unusual for me to go sailing off personally into space . Ergo , I must have found some . But he does n't want me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He can get it only by following this ship . Until we tie on to something , we 're as safe as a babe in a bassinet . So why worry ? " " Why worry ? " The kid 's brains almost crackled audibly in their attempt to transmit his worry to the scientist . " Here 's something ! Has it occurred to you that all the Martian has to do is to determine our course , continue it ahead on a chart , and then know our destination ? " " It has occurred to me , " said Nudnick gently . " Our course will intercept Mercury in twenty days . " " Mercury ! " Hughie cried . " You told me the prosydium was on an asteroid ! " " It is an asteroid . " Nudnick was being assidiously patient . " You know it , and I know it . But our course is for Mercury . That 's all they know . If we lose them , we will change course for the Belt . If we do n't lose them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'll go back to Earth and try again some time , though I will admit that there 's only a billion to one chance of our slipping away without being followed again . " " I 'm sorry , " said Hughie after a while . " I have no business in trying to tell you off , Professor Nudnick . Only I hate like hell to see that Bjornsen guy keep you away from what you want to get . That heel . That lousy wart on the nose of progress ! " " End quotes , " said Nudnick dryly . " Captain Jaundess . " " O.K. , O.K. , " said Hughie , grinning in spite of himself . " But I ca n't seem to get over that guy Bjornsen . He got in my hair for nearly two years at school , and now that he 's kicked me out he seems to want to get under my scalp as well . I du n no  --  I never saw a guy like that before . I ca n't figger him  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on kids . He 's inhuman ! " " You may he right , " said Nudnick slowly . " You may just possibly be right . " After a long pause , he said , " I picked the right assistant , Hughie . You 're doing tine . ' ? LI Itighie was so tickled by that remark that he did n't think to ask what In caked it .  | Two days before they were due on Mercury , the professor heaved a sigh , glanced at Hughie , and connected up the stern visiscreen . " There you are , " he said quietly . Hughie looked up from his magazine , dropped it with a gasp of horror . The Martian ship was not two hundred yards behind them , looming up , filling the screen . He sprang to his feet . " Professor Nudnick ! Do something ! " Nudnick shook his head , spread his hands . " Any ideas ? " " There must be something . Ca n't you blast them , professor ? " " With what ? The Patrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defeatist philosophy aside impatiently . " There ought to be something you could do . Heck  --  you 're supposed to be ten times the scientist that Harry Petrou is ? " " I beg your pardon ? " " Harry Petrou . . . Petrou ! " Hughie swept up the magazine , thrust the too-bright cover in the scientist 's face . " The writer ! The author of ? " " Satan Strong ! " The dried-up old man let out an astonishingly hearty peal of laughter . " Well , " said Hughie defensively , " anyway ? " Furiously he began to shout half hysterical phrases . He was scared , and he had a bad case of hero worship , and he was also very young . He said , " You go ahead and laugh . But Harry Petrou has some pretty damn good ideas . Maybe they 're not scientific . Not what you 'd call scientific . Why does n't anybody ever do anything scientific without studying for fifty years in a dusty old laboratory ? Why does one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sit back and b-be bullied by a I-louse like Bjornsen ? " " Hughie  --  take it easy , there . " Nudnick put out his hand , then turned away from those young , accusing eyes . " Things are n't done that way , Hughie . Science is n't like that  --  made to order for melodramatic adventures . I know ? you 'd like me to burrow into the air conditioner , throw a few connections around , and come out with a space-warp . " Hughie turned on the lower forward screen . It showed , blindingly , the flaming crescent of the inner planet . They were descending swiftly toward the night-edge of the twilight strip , the automatic pilot taking care of every detail of deceleration and gravity control . " You 're quitting , " said Hughie , his lip quivering . " You 're running away ! " And he turned his back to Nudnick , to stare at the evil menacing bulk of the Martian ship . Nudnick sighed , went and sat at the controls , and took over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hughie observed that Nudnick was preparing to land . He said , in a ( lead voice : " If you land , they 'll catch us. "  | " That 's right . " Nudnick 's voice was brisk . " And if they catch us , they 'll torture us . " " Yep . " Nudnick glanced over his shoulder . " Will you obey my orders implicitly ? " " Sure , " said Hughie hopelessly . His eyes were fixed in fearful fascination on the Martian ship . " Start now , then . Get rid of all the metal on your clothes . Belt buckle , buttons  --  everything . You have fiber soled boots ? " " Mm-m-m . " " Put them on . Snap into it ! " An hour later the Stou fe11a grated on a sandy clearing not far from a red and rocky bluff . The choking atmosphere of Mercury swirled about the portholes . Nudnick climbed out of the pilot seat and tore a pair of fiber boots out of a locker . He had already ripped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the chart table . " Come on ! " he snapped . " You . . . we 're not going out there ? " " You 're damn right we are . " Hughie looked at him . If this old man was willing  --  He shrugged , picked up a magazine . It seemed as if he  --  stroked it . Then he tossed it aside and strode with Nudnick into the air lock . As the inner gate shut them out of the little world that the ship afforded , Nudnick clapped him on the back . " Chin up , kiddo , " he said warmly . " Now listen  --  do exactly as I tell you . When we get outside , move as fast as you can toward that bluff . The Martians wo n't shoot as long as they think we have any information . Na  --  no questions  --  there is n't time ! Listen . It 's hot out there . As hot as the oven my dear old mother used to bake ten-egg cakes in . The air is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while . Long enough , I guess . Ready ? " The outer gate slid back and they plunged out . It was hot . In seconds acrid dust was packing on Hughie 's skin , washing away in veritable gushes of sweat , packing the pores again . He saw the reason for taking off metal clothing . He had left his identification ring on ; it began to sear his hand . He tore it off , and blistered flesh with it . The air lacerated his throat , stung his eyes . Somehow he knew the location of three things  --  the red bluff , the hovering Martian ship , and the professor . He pounded on . Once he tripped , went down on one knee . His breeches burst into ' Lune . Nudnick saw and helped him slap it out . Inside the charred edges of both 1w caught a glimpse of his own kneecap , a tiny spot of bone amid a circle of ' cooked flesh , where his knee had ground into the burning sand . Nudnick tugged at his elbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he wheezed. i lughie suddenly realized that Nudnick 's old eyes could n't see very far in this  | kind of heat ; he had to be eyes for two people now . " Ship  --  hundred and fifty  --  yards ? " " Not  --  far enough ! Go on ! " They struggled on , helping each other , hindering each other . The ground rose sharply ; Nudnick stopped . " Beginning of ... bluff ... far ... enough ? " He began coughing . Hughie held him up until he had finished . He began to understand . He had heard vague stories about Martian torture . Nudnick would rather die this way , then . They could have starved slowly in the ship . Maybe this was better Nudnick 's shrill , dust-choked whisper reached him . " Martians ? " Hughie put one hand over his eyes and peered through the fingers . The Martian ship had settled down beside the Stoutfella . The port swung open , three figures , two tall and lanky , one short and shriveled . " Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Talking was torture . Breathing was pulling fire into the lungs . He heard a noise and looked down . Nudnick was clutching him and making the noise . Slowly he realized that the old man , and just in time , or they would have fallen and died . " Of all the crazy damn things to do ! " shrilled Bjornsen . In spite of the blazing breeze , the insufferable heat , the old gestures returned to him , and he rubbed his hands together in that familiar , despised gesture . Nudnick forced his eyes open and stared at the councilman worriedly , and then turned to each of the Martians . They were wilting a little bit in the heat , but their grip was still strong . Bjornsen spoke a few squeaky words in the Martian tongue , and the five of them began to struggle toward the ships . Suddenly the Martian who had Hughie 's arm began to cry out in a piercing , undulating whine . It was quite the most ghastly sound the boy had ever heard ; he shuddered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To his utter amazement the Martian slumped to the ground , arched his back as it began to scorch , screamed deafeningly and then lay still . Nudnick laughed cacklingly again and shoved at his Martian , tripping him at the same time . The second Martian stumbled , regained his balance , and then began screaming . In a matter of seconds he fell . He took longer , but died also Bjornsen stood in front of them , watching the Martians , and then , shouting agonized curses , began a stumbling run toward his ship . " Damn it , he 's going to make it ! " cried Nudnick ; and stooping , he caught up a hot stone and hurled it . Straight as an explosive pellet it flew , and caught Bjornsen between his narrow shoulders . Bjornsen threw up his hands , trying wildly to keep his feet . Gibbering crazily , Nudnick threw another stone . It missed by twenty feet . Ilughie caught the old man as he tell exhausted . When next he ** at  | Bjornsen , the councilman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sill of the Martian 's air lock . He sagged , writhed , and died there . Hughie stood for five seconds , tottering ; then he shook his head , bent and let the scientist 's limp body fall across his shoulder . It took him an eternity to straighten up , and then eternities to locate his nearby ship and begin that long , long , fifty-foot journey . Hughie knew later that if it had been five  --  three  --  feet more , he could not possibly have made it . But somehow he did  --  somehow he tumbled the old man into the lock , pitched forward on top of him . He scrabbled weakly around , found the lock control , pressed it . Hughie screamed when he came out of it . Then he opened his eyes and saw that he was n't in that fiery desert . He closed them again and realized that his knee hurt terribly . Then Nudnick was beside him , bathing his face , talking . " Good stuff , kid . Fix you up in no time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prosydium , eh ? Well , we 'll get it now . No one else around . No one else around . " " Bjornsen ? " " Dead . Remember ? Like the Martians . " " Martians . " The words brought horror into the heat-reddened young face . He raised his head and Nudnick slipped another pillow under it . " What happened to those Martians ? " Nudnick grinned . " They died of ignorance , son , and let that be a lesson to you . " Hughie just stared . " You see , for generations now , Martians have lived on Earth and Earthmen on Mars . It made ' em forget something  --  that one little fact I was talking about before we landed . Water-hoarders , Hughie . Martians ca n't sweat ! You see ? A human can live beside a steak that 's cooking , because he sweats . The evaporation cools him down . A Martian ca n't stand that kind of heat he cooks like a steak ! " " But . . . Bjornsen was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bjornsen was ! A freak , Hughie . Look at Martians . Unemotional  --  logical ? well , is n't that Bjornsen ? Y'know , when I walked in on him when he was ganging up on you at the Institute , I heard him rub his hands together . I 'd heard it somewhere before , but I did n't know just where . But the other day when you said he was inhuman , it clicked . Bjornsen did n't have no mamma and no poppa , kiddo . He came out of a Martian biochemical laboratory , or I. miss my guess . Clever fellers , those Martians . Trained him from birth for that job . A key man in the middle of my little old institute , There may be more like him . I 'll see to that . Heh ! I wo n't be the first boss that 's told his employees , Work up a sweat or get canned ! ' " I lughie at last managed to grin a little . Nudnick kept on talking happily . " The knee 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll hook on to the prosydium . You 're fixed for life fella . Ali ? hev , I 've got a confession to make to you . "  | Hughie turned weak , amused eyes on him . The old man wagged his head . " Yep . About that prosydium . Did n't you wonder how I knew about it ? I 'll tell you . I was coming from Mars last year on a Martian liner . Very elegant . Humidifiers in every room . Radio . Recorded music . Lots of apparatus built into the staterooms . Would 've delighted the heart of Satan Strong . Anyway , I got messing around I . . . er ? " He paused guiltily , then went on . " I sort of tore out some connections and spot-welded some busbars . Built me a dandy little detectograph . Located that prosydium as we passed the edge of the Belt . Sheer luck . Spotted it , by golly , right from a stateroom in a Martian ship ! " Hughie laughed admiringly . " You old son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you sneered at Satan Strong ! " " Me ? " The old man shook his head and stood up . " Why should I sneer at Satan Strong ? I like Satan Strong . I ought to . I write those stories ! "  | Not fun . A horrid little fantasy , derived from true-life observations by a man who loved children , but not children like this one . Those ones . " It 's strictly a short-order proposition , " said Michaele , tossing her searchlight hair back on her shoulders . " We 've got to have a baby eight days from now or we 're out a sweet pile of cash . " " We 'll get one somewhere . Could n't we adopt one or something ? " I said , plucking a stalk of grass from the bank of the brook and jamming it between my front teeth . " Takes weeks . We could kidnap one , maybe . " " They got laws . Laws are for the protection of people . " " Why does it always have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " Shorty , get your bulk up off the ground and think of something . " " Think better this way , " I said . " We could borrow one . " " Look , " said Mike . " When I get my hands on a kid , that child and I have to go through a short but rigorous period of training . It 's likely to be rough . If I had a baby and someone wanted to borrow it for any such purpose , I 'd be damned if I 'd let it go . " " ( ) h , you would n't be too tough , " I said . " You 've got maternal instincts and stuff . " " Shortly , you do n't seem to realize that babies are very delicate creatures and require the most skilled and careful handling . I do n't know anything about them . I am an only child , and I went right from high school into business  | college and from there into an office . The only experience I ever had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an afternoon . It cried all the time I was there . " " Should 've changed its diapers . " " I did . " " Must 've stuck it with a pin then . " " I did not ! You seem to know an awful lot about children , " she said hotly . " Sure I do . I was one myself once . " " Heel ! " She leaped on me and rolled me into the brook , I came up spluttering and swearing . She took me by the neck , pulled me half up on the bank and began thudding my head on the soft bank . " Let go my apple , " I gasped . " This is no choking matter . " " Now will you cooperate ? Shorty , quit your kidding . This is serious . Your Aunt Amanda has left us thirty grand , providing we can prove to her sister Jonquil that we are the right kind of people . Those who can take care of a baby can take care of money , ' she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonquil 's eye for thirty days and take care of a baby . No nursemaids , no laundresses , no nothing . " " Let 's wait till we have one of our own . " " Do n't be stupid ! You know as well as I do that that money will set you up in a business of your own as well as paying off the mortgage on the shack . And decorating it . And getting us a new car . " " And a fur coat . And a star sapphire . Maybe I 'll even get a new pair of socks . " " Shorty ! " A full lip quivered , green eyes swam . " Oh , darling , I did n't mean ? Come here and be kissed . " She did . Then she went right on where she had left off . She 's like that . She can puddle up at the drop of a cynicism , and when I apologize she sniffs once and the tears all go back into her eyes without being used . She holds them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But you know perfectly well that unless we get our hands on money  --  lots of it  --  and darn soon , we 'll lose that barn and the garage that we built just to put a new car in . Would n't that be silly ? " " No . No garage , no need for a car . Save lots of money ! " " Shorty  --  please . " " All right , all right . The fact that everything you say is correct does n't help to get us a baby for thirty days . Damn money anyway ! Money is n't everything ! " " Of course it is n't , darling , " said Michaele sagely , " but it 's what you buy everything with . " A sudden splash from the brook startled us . Mike screamed . " Shortly  --  grab him ! " I plunged into the water and hauled out a very tiny , very dirty  --  baby . It was  | dressed in a tattered romper , and it had an elfin face , big blue eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprayed me  --  b-b-b-b-b-br-r-r  --  with a combination of a mouthful of water and a Bronx cheer . " Oh , the poor darling little angel ! " said Mike . " Give him to me , Shorty ! You 're handling him like a bag of sugar ! " I stepped gingerly out of the brook and handed him over . Michaele cradled the filthy mite in her arms , completely oblivious to the child 's effect on her white linen blouse . The same white linen blouse , I reflected bitterly , that I had been kicked out of the house for , when I pitched some cigar ashes on it . It made me feel funny , watching Mike handle that kid . I 'd never pictured her that way . The baby regarded Mike gravely as she discoursed to it about a poor drowned woofum-wuffums , and did the bad man treat it badly , then . The baby belched eloquently . " He belches in English ! " I remarked . " Did it have the windy ripples ? " cooed Mike . " Give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flung its little arms around her neck and planted a whopper on her mouth . " Wow ! " said Mike when she got her breath . " Shorty , could you take lessons ! " " Lessons my eye , " I said jealously . " Mike , that 's no baby , that 's some old guy in his second childhood . " " The idea . " She crooned to the baby for a moment , and then said suddenly . " Shorty  --  what were we talking about before heaven opened up and dropped this little bundle of ? " Here the baby tried to squirm out of her arms and she paused to get a better grip . " Bundle of what ? " I asked , deadpan . " Bundle of joy . " " Oh ! Bundle of joy . What were we talking about ? Ba ? Hey ! Babies ! " " That 's right . And a will . And thirty grand . " I looked at the child with new eyes . " Who do you think belongs to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him if we take him away for thirty days " she said . " No matter what bungling treatment I give him , it 's bound to be better than what he 's used to . Letting a mere babe crawl around in the woods ! Why , it 's awful ! " " The mere babe does n't seem to mind " I said . " Tell you what we 'll do ? we 'll take care of him for a few days and see if anyone claims him . We 'll listen to the radio and watch the papers and the of grapevine . If anybody does claim him , maybe we can make a deal for a loan . At any rate we 'll get to work on him right away . "  | At this juncture the baby eeled out of Mike 's arms and took off across the grass . " Sweet Sue ! Look at him go ! " she said , scrambling to her feet . " Get him , Shorty ! " The infant , with twinkling heels , was crawling  --  running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I headed him off just as he reached the water , and snagged him up by the slack of his pants . As he came up off the ground he scooped up a handful of mud and pitched it into my eyes . I yelped and dropped him . When I could see a little daylight again I beheld Michaele taking a running brodie into a blackberry bush . I hurried over there , my eyelids making a nasty grating sound . Michaele was lying prone behind the baby , who was also lying prone , his little heels caught tightly in Mike 's hands . He was nonchalantly picking blackberries . Mike got her knees and then her feet under her , and picked up the baby , who munched contentedly . " I 'm disgusted with you , " she said , her eyes blazing . " Flinging an innocent child around like that ! Why , it 's a wonder you did n't break every bone in his poor little body ! " " But I  --  He threw mud in my ?

That little brat there ? " " Shorty ! Talking that way about a poor little baby ! He 's beautiful ! He did n't mean anything by what he did . He 's too young to know any better . " In the biggest , deepest bass voice I have ever heard , the baby said , " Lady , I do know what I 'm doin ' . I 'm old enough ! " We both sat down . " Did you say that ? " Mike wanted to know . I shook my head dazedly . " Coupla dopes , " said the baby . " Who ? What are you ? " asked Mike breathlessly . " What do I look like ? " said the baby , showing his teeth . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top gum and four on the lower . " A little bundle of " Shorty ! " Mike held up a slim finger . " Never mind him , " growled the child . " I know lots of four-letter words . Go ahead , bud . " " You go ahead . What are you  --  a midget ? " I no sooner got the second syllable of that word out when the baby scuttled over to me and rocked my head hack with a surprising right to the jaw . " ' That 's the last time I 'm going to he called that by anybody ! " 1k roared deafeningly.  | " No ! I 'm not a . . . a . . . what you said . I 'm a pro tern changeling , and that 's all .

When people treat their babies too well  --  or not well enough  --  I show up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm always the spitting image of their kid . When they wise up in the treatment , they get their kids back  --  not before . " " Who pulls the switch ? I mean , who do you work for ? " The baby pointed to the grass at our feet . I had to look twice before I realized what he was pointing at . The blades were dark and glossy and luxuriant in a perfect ring about four feet in diameter . Michaele gasped and put her knuckles to her lips . " The Little People ! " she breathed . I was going to say , " Do n't be silly , Mike ! " but her taut face and the baby 's bland , nodding head stopped me . " Will you work for us ? " she asked breathlessly . " We need a baby for thirty days to meet the conditions of a will .

" If you work for us , you 'll get all the steaks you can eat . " " No . " " What would you want to work for us ? " " Nothin ' . I do n't wan na work for you . " " What are we going to do ? " I whispered to Mike . " This would be perfect ! " " Leave it to me . Look  --  baby  --  what 's your name , anyway ? " " Percival . But do n't call me Percival ! Butch .

" " What happens if you lose th ' house ? " " A furnished room . The two of us . " " What 's the matter with that ? I tensed . This was a question I had asked her myself .  | " Not for me . I just could n't live that way . " Mike would wheedle , but she would n't lie . Butch furrowed his nonexistent eyebrows . " Could n't ? Y ' know , I like that . High standards . " His voice deepened ; the question lashed her . " Would you live with him in a furnished room if there were no other way ? " " Well , of course . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? " I asked . " What do you expect to get out of it ? " " Nothing  --  some fun , maybe . I 'll help you because you need help . That 's the only reason I ever do anything for anybody . That 's the only thing you should have told me in the first place  --  that you were in a jam . You and your bribes ! " he snapped at me , and turned to Mike . " I ai n't gon na like that guy , " he said . I said , " I already do n't like you . " As we started back to the house Butch said , " But I 'm gon na get my steaks ? " Aunt Jonquil 's house stood alone in a large lot with its skirts drawn primly up and an admonishing expression on its face . It looked as if it had squeezed its way between two other houses to hide itself , and some scoundrel had taken the other houses away . And Aunt Jonquil , like her house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely practical , unbeautifully ornate , and stood alone . She regarded marriage as an unfortunate necessity . She herself never married because an unkind nature had ruled that she must marry a man , and she thought that men were uncouth . She disapproved of smoking , drinking , swearing , gambling , and loud laughter . Smiles she enjoyed only if she could fully understand what was being smiled at ; she mistrusted innuendo . A polite laugh was a thing she permitted herself perhaps twice a week , providing it was atoned for by ten minutes of frozen-faced gravity . Added to which , she was a fine person . Swell . On the way to the city , I sat through this unnerving conversation . Butch said , " Fathead ! Drive more carefully ! " " He 's doing all right , " said Mike . " Really . It surprises me . He 's usually an Indian . " She was looking very lovely in a peagreen linen jacket and a very simple white skirt and a buff straw hat that looked like a halo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleam in his eye to offset the angelic combination of a pale-blue sweater with white rabbits applied on the sides , and fuzzy Angora booties on which he had insisted because I was wearing a navy-blue and he knew it would come off all over me . He was , I think , a little uncomfortable due to my rather unskilled handling of his diapering . And the reason for my doing that job was to cause us more trouble than a little bit . Butch 's ideas of privacy and the proprieties were advanced . Ile would no more think of letting Mike bathe or change him than I would think of letting Garbo change me . Thinking about this , I said :  | " Butch , that prudishness of yours is going to be tough to keep up at Aunt Jonquil 's . " " You 'll keep it up , son , " said the infant , " or I 'll quit working . I ai n't going to have no women messin ' around me that way . What d'ye think I am  --  an exhibitionist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " And I 'll tell you why . You said you made a life 's work of substituting for children . How could you with ideas like that ? Who you trying to horse up ? " " Oh , " said Butch , " that . Well , I might 's well confess to you that I ai n't done that kind of work in years . I got sick of it . I was gettin ' along in life and .. . well , you can imagine . Well , about thutty years ago I was out on a job an ' the woman was changin ' my drawers when a half-dozen babes arrived from her sewin ' circle . She left off workin ' right where she was and sang out for them all to come in and see how pretty I looked the way I was .

I thought they 'd put me to work hauntin ' houses or cleanin ' dishes for sick people or somethin ' , but no  --  they cracked down on me . Told me I 'd have to stay this way until I was repentant . " " Are you ? " giggled Mike . Butch snorted . " Not so you 'd notice it , " he growled . " Repentant because I believe in common decency ? Heh ? " " We waited a long time after we rang the bell before Jonquil opened the door . That was to give her time to peep out at us from the tumorous bay window and compose her features to meet the niece by marriage her unfastidious nephew had acquired . " Jonquil ! " I said heartily , dashing forward and delivering the required peck on her cheek . Jonquil expected her relatives to use her leathery cheek precisely as she herself used a napkin . Pat . Dry surface on dry surface . Moisture is vulgar . " And this is Michaele , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you do ? " demurely , and smiled . Aunt Jonquil stepped back a pace and held her head as if she were sighting at Mike through her nostrils . " Oh , yes , " she said without moving her lips . The smile disappeared from Mike 's face and came back with an effort of will that hurt . " Come in , " said Jonquil at last , and with some reluctance . We trailed through a foyer and entered the parlor . It was n't a living room , it was an honest-to-goodness front parlor with antimacassars and sea shells . The tone of the room was sepia  --  light from the background of the heavily flowered wallpaper , ( lark for the furniture . The chairs and a hard-looking divan were covered with a material that looked as if it had been bleeding badly some months ago . When Butch 's eye caught the glassed-in monstrosity of hay and &ad; flowers over the mantelpiece , he retched audibly.  | " What a lovely place you have here , " said Mike . " Glad you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's have a look at the child . " She walked over and peered at Butch . He scowled at her . " Good heavens ! " she said . " Is n't he lovely ? " said Mike . " Of course , " said Jonquil without enthusiasm , and added , after searching her store of ready-made expressions , " the little wudgums ! " She kitchy-cooed his chin with her sharp forefinger . He immediately began to wail , with the hoarse , high-pitched howl of a genuine baby . " The poor darling 's tired after his trip , " said Mike . Jonquil , frightened by Butch 's vocal explosion , took the hint and led the way upstairs . " Is the whole damn house like this ? " whispered Butch hoarsely . " No . I do n't know . Shut up , " said Mike . My sharp-eared aunt swiveled on the steps . " And go to sleepy-bye , " she crooned aloud . She bent her head over his and hissed , " And keep on crying , you little wretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a bedroom , austerely furnished , the kind of room they used in the last century for sleeping purposes only , and therefore designed so that it was quite unattractive to anyone with anything but sleep on his mind . It was all gray and white ; the only spot of color in the room was the bedstead , which was a highly polished pipe organ . Mike laid the baby down on the bed and stripped off his booties , his shirt and his sweater . Butch put his fist in his mouth and waited tensely . " Oh  --  I almost forgot . I have the very same bassinet you used , up in the attic , " said Jonquil . " I should have had it ready . Your telegram was rather abrupt , Horace . You should have let me know sooner that you 'd come today . " She angled out of the room . " Horace ! I 'll be ? Is your name Hoarce ? " asked Butch in delight . " Yes , " I said gruffly . " But it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And I was worried about you callin ' me Percival ! " I helped set up the bassinet and we tucked Butch in for his nap . I managed to be fooling around with his bedclothes when Mike bent over dutifully to give him a kiss . I grabbed Butch 's chin and held it down so the kiss landed on his forehead . He was mightily wroth , and bit my finger till it bled . I stuck it in my pocket and told him , " I 'll see you later , bummy-wummy ! " He made a noise , and Jonquil fled , blushing . We convened in the kitchen , which was far and away the pleasantest room in the house . " Where on earth did you get that child ? " Jonquil asked , peering into a nice-smelling saucepan on the old-fashioned range . " Neighbor 's child , " I said . " They were very poor and were glad to have him off their hands for a few weeks . "  | " He 's a foundling , " Mike ingeniously supplemented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been adopted or anything . " " What 's his name ? " " We call him Butch . " " How completely vulgar ! " said Jonquil . " I will have no child named Butch in my house . We shall have to give him something more refined . " I had a brain wave . " How about Percival ? " I said . " Percival . Percy , " murmured Jonquil , testing it out . " That is much better . That will do . I knew somebody called Percival once . " " Oh  --  you better not call him Percival , " said Mike , giving me her no-goodcan-come-of-this look . " Why not ? " I said blandly . " Lovely name . " " Yeah , " said Mike . " Lovely . " " What time does Percival get his dinner ? " asked Jonquil . " Six o'clock . " " Good , " said Jonquil . " I 'll feed him ! " " Oh no , Aunt J  --  I mean , Miss Timmins . That 's our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I 'd like to do it , " she said . " You 're not making an inescapable duty out of this , are you ? " " I do n't know what you mean , " said Mike , a little coldly . " We like that child . " Jonquil peered intently at her . " I believe you do , " she said in a surprised tone , and started out of the room . At the door she called back , " You need n't call me Miss Timmins , " and she was gone . " Well ! " said Mike . " Looks like you won the war , babe . " " Only the first battle , honey , and do n't think I do n't know it . What a peculiar old duck she is ! " She busied herself at the stove , warming up some strained carrots she had taken out of a jar , sterilizing a bottle and filling it with pineapple juice . We had read a lot of baby manuals in the last Fcw days ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " I du n no . I guess she 's  --  Good grief ? " There was a dry-boned shriek from upstairs and then the sound of hard heels pounding along the upper hallway toward the front stairs . We went up the lack stairs two at a time , and saw the flash of Jonquil 's dimity skirts as she disappeared downstairs . We slung into the bedroom . Butch was lying in his bassinet doubled up in some kind of spasm . " Now what ? " I groaned . " Ile 's choking , " said Mike . " What are we going to do , Shorty ? " I did n't know . Mike ran and turned him over . His face was all twisted up and lie %vas pouring sweat and gasping . " Butch ! Butch ? What 's the matter ? "  | And just then he got his wind back . " Ho ho ho ! " he roared in his bullfrog voice , and lost it again . " He 's laughing ! " Mike whispered . " That the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said glumly . I reached out and smacked him across the puss . " Butch ! Snap out of it ! " " Ooh ! " said Butch . " You lousy heel . I 'll get you for that . " " Sorry , Butch . But I thought you were strangling . " " Guess I was at that , " he said , and started to laugh again . " Shorty , I could n't help it . See , that of vinegar visage come in here and started staring at me . I stared right back . She bends over the bassinet . I grin . She grins . I open my mouth . She opens her mouth . I reach in and pull out her bridgework and pitch it out the windy . Her face sags down in the middle like a city street in Scranton . She does the steam-siren act and hauls out o ' here . But Shorty ? Mike " ? and he went off into another helpless spasm ? " you shoulda seen her face ! " We all subsided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my petunias , " she said primly . " Why  --  you have dinner on the table . Thank you , child . " " Round two , " I said noncommittally . Around two in the morning I was awakened by a soft thudding in the hallway . I came up on one elbow . Mike was fast asleep . But the bassinet was empty . I breathed an oath and tiptoed out into the hall . Halfway down was Butch , crawling rapidly . In two strides I had him by the scruff of the neck . " Awk ! " " Shut up ! Where do you think you 're going ? " He thumbed at a door down the hall . " " No , Butch . Get on back to bed . You ca n't go there . " He looked at me pleadingly . " I ca n't ? Not for nothin ' ? " " Not for nothin ' . " " Aw  --  Shorty . Gim me a break . " " Break my eyebrow . You belong in that bassinet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked worriedly at Jonquil 's bedroom door . " All right , dammit . But make it snappy . " Butch went on strike the third day . He did n't like those strained vegetables and soups to begin with , and then one morning he heard the butcher bov downstairs , singing out , " Here 's yer steaks , Miss Timmins ! " That was enough for little Percival . " There 's got to he a new deal around here , chum , " he said the next time he got me in the room alone . " I 'm gettin ' robbed . "  | " Robbed ? Who 's taking what ? " " Youse . You promise me steaks , right ? Listen , Shorty , I 'm through with that pap you been feedin ' me . I 'm starvin ' to death on it . " " What would you suggest ? " I asked calmly . " Shall I have one done to your taste and delivered to your room , sir ? " " You know what , Shorty ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forefinger into the front of my shirt for emphasis . " You 're kiddin ' , but I ai n't . An ' what you just said is a pretty good idea . I want a steak once a day  --  here in this room . I mean it , son . " I opened my mouth to argue and then looked deep into those baby eyes . I saw an age-old stubborness , an insurmountable firmness of character there . I shrugged and went out . In the kitchen I found Mike and Jonquil deeply engaged in some apparently engrossing conversation about rayon taffeta . I broke it up by saying , " I just had an idea . Tonight I 'm going to eat my supper upstairs with Bu . . . Percival . I want you to get to know each other better , and I would commune with another male for a spell . I 'm outnumbered down here . " Jonquil actually did smile this time . Smiles seemed to be coming to her a little more easily these days . " I think that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're having steak tonight , Horace . How do you like yours ? " " Broiled , " said Mike , " and well d ? " " Rare ! " I said , sending a glance at Mike . She shut up , wonderingly . And that night I sat up in the bedroom , watching that miserable infant eat my dinner . He did it with gusto , with much smacking of the lips and grunting in ecstasy . " What do you expect me to do with this ? " I asked , holding up a cupful of lukewarm and sticky strained peas . " I do n't know , " said Butch with his mouth full . " That 's your problem . " I went to the window and looked out . Directly below was a spotless concrete walk which would certainly get spattered if I pitched the unappetizing stuff out there . " Butch  --  wo n't you get rid of the stuff for me ? " He sighed , his chin all greasy from my steak . " Thanks , no , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I tasted the peas tentatively , held my nose and gulped them down . As I swallowed the last of them I found time to direct a great many highly unpleasant thoughts at Butch . " No remarks , Percy , " I growled . He just grinned . I picked up his plates and the cup and started out . " Have n't you forgotten something ? " he asked sleepily . " What ? " Ile nodded toward the dresser and the bottle which stood on it . Boiled milk with water and corn syrup added . " Damned if I will ! " I snapped . I le grinned , opened his mouth and started to wail .  | " Shut up ! " I hissed . " You 'll have them women up here claiming I 'm twisting your tail or something . " " That 's the idea , " said Butch . " Now drink your milk like a good little boy and you can go out and play . " I muttered something impotently , ripped the nipple off the bottle and gulped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady to call me Percy , " said Butch . " I want another steak tomorrow . ' Bye now . " And that 's how it came about that I , a full-grown man in good health , lived for close to two weeks on baby food . I think that the deep respect I have for babies dates from this time , and is founded on my realization of how goodnatured they are on the diet they get . It sure did n't work that way with me . What really griped me was having to watch him eat my meals . Brother , I was earning that thirty grand the hard way . About the beginning of the third week Butch 's voice began to change . Mike noticed it first and came and told me . " I think something 's the matter with him , " she said . " He does n't seem as strong as he was , and his voice is getting high-pitched . " " Do n't borrow trouble , beautiful , " I said , putting my arm around her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diet he 's getting . And he has plenty of lung power . " " That 's another thing , " she said in a puzzled tone . " This morning he was crying and I went in to see what he wanted . I spoke to him and shook him but he went on crying for almost five minutes before he suddenly sat up and said What ? What ? Eh  --  it 's you , Mike . ' I asked him what he wanted ; he said nothing and told me to scram . " " He was kidding you . " She twisted out of my arms and looked up at me , her golden brows just touching over the snowy crevasse of her frown . " Shorty  --  he was crying  --  real tears . " That was the same day that Jonquil went in to town and bought herself a half dozen bright dresses . And I strongly suspect she had something done to her hair . She looked fifteen years younger when she came in and said , " Horace  --  it seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . yes ? " " Silly boy ! You 've stopped smoking just because you think I would n't approve ! I like to have a man smoking around the house . Makes it more homey . Here . " She pressed something into my hand and fled , red-faced and bright-eyed . I looked at what she had given me . Two packs of cigarettes . They were n't my brand , but I do n't think I have ever been so deeply touched .  | I went and had a talk with Butch . He was sleeping lightly when I entered the room . I stood there looking down at him . He was awful tiny , I thought . I wonder what it is these women gush so much about . Butch 's eyes were so big under his lids that they seemed as if they just could n't stay closed . The lashes lay on his cheek with the most gentle of delicate touches . He breathed evenly , with occasionally a tiny catch . It made nice listening , somehow . I caught a movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clenching and unclenching . It was very rosy , and far too small to be so perfect . I looked at my own hand and at his , and I just could n't believe it .. . He woke suddenly , opening his eyes and kicking . He looked first at the window , and then at the wall opposite . He whimpered , swallowed , gave a little cry . Then he turned his head and saw me . For a long moment he watched me , his deep eyes absolutely unclouded ; suddenly he sat up and shook his head . " Hello , " he said sleepily . I had the strange sensation of watching a person wake up twice . I said , " Mike 's worried about you , " I told him why . " Really ? " he said . " I  --  do n't feel much different . Heh ! Imagine this happening to me ! " " Imagine what happening ? " " I 've heard of it before , but I never . . . Shorty , you wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all that baby food , and all those steaks . " Do n't worry . You ai n't funny . " Well , you know what I told you about me being a changeling . Changelings is funny animals . Nobody likes ' em . They raise all kinds of hell . Fathers resent ' em because they cry all night . Mothers get panicky if they do n't know it 's a changeling , and downright resentful if they do . A changeling has a lot of fun hein ' a brat , but he do n't get much emotional sugar , if you know what I mean . Well , in my case . . . dammit , I ca n't get used to it ! Me , of all people . . . well , someone around here . . . uh . . . loves me . " " Not me , " I said quickly , backing away . " I know , not you . " He gave me a sudden , birdlike glance and said softly , " You 're a pretty good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Anyway , they say that if any woman loves a changeling , he loses his years and his . memories , and turns into a real human kid . But he 's got to be loved for himself , not for some kid he replaces . " He shifted uneasily . " I do n't ... I ca n't get used to it happening to me , but ... oh oh ! " A pained expression came across his face and he looked at me helplessly . I took in the situation at a glance . A few minutes later I corralled Mike . " Got something for you , " I said , and handed her something made of ' layette cloth .  | " What 's ... Shorty ! Not ? " I nodded . " Butch 's getting infantile , " I said . While she was doing the laundry a while later I told her what Butch had said . She was very quiet while I told her , and afterward . " Mike  --  if there is anything in all this fantastic business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's making this change in him ? " She thought it over for a long time and then said , " I think he 's terribly cute , Shorty . " I swung her around . She had soapsuds on her temple , where her fingers had trailed when she tossed her bright hair back with her wrist . " Who 's the number one man around here ? " I whispered . She laughed and said I was silly and stood on tiptoe to kiss me . She 's a little bit of a thing . The whole thing left me feeling awful funny . Our thirty days were up , and we packed . Jonquil helped us , and I 've never seen her so full of life . Half the time she laughed , and once in a while she actually broke down and giggled . And at lunch she said to us , " Horace  --  I 'm afraid to let you take little Percy back with you . You said that those people who had him were sort of ne'er-do-wells , and they would n't miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for a week or so while you find out just what their home life is like , and whether they really want him back . If not , I . . . well , I 'll see that he gets a good place to live in . " Mike and I looked at each other , and then Mike looked up at the ceiling , toward the bedroom . I got up suddenly . " I 'll ask him , " I said , and walked upstairs . Butch was sitting up in the bassinet trying to catch a sunbeam . " Hey ! " I said . " Jonquil wants you to stick around . What do you say ? " He looked at me , and his eyes were all baby , nothing else . " Well ? " He made some tremendous mental effort , pursed his lips , took a deep breath , held it for an unconscionable time , and then one word burst out . " Percy ! " " I get it , " I said . " So long , fella . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his sunbeam . " It 's O.K. with him , " I said when I got back to the table . " You never struck me as the kind of man who would play games with children , " laughed Jonquil . " You 'll do . . . you 'll do . Michaele , dear  --  I want you to write to me . I 'm so glad you came . " So we got our thirty grand . We wrote as soon as we reached the shack  --  our shack , now  --  that no , the people would n't want Percy hack , and that his last  | name was  --  Fay . We got a telegram in return thanking us and telling us that Jonquil was adopting the baby . " You goin ' to miss of Butch ? " I asked Mike . " No , " she said . " Not too much . I 'm sort of saving up . " " Oh , " I said .                @ @ @ @ @
