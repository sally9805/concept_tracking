Anderson has himself and the system to blame for his failure <P> When John Anderson began his independent race for the presidency last April , his campaign was more than a pipe dream and an ego trip . The public opinion polls showed that great numbers of Americans were unhappy with the prospective nominations of Reagan and Carter . They indicated as well that a lot of people were eager for a third choice . Looking back , an Anderson aide said last week : " The whole campaign represents a missed opportunity . " The reasons that Anderson failed to exploit his opportunity were a result partly of his own limitations and partly of those of the system . His experience showed dramatically how difficult it is for an independent to reach the White House . <P> Written by Republicans and Democrats , the election rules naturally provide a huge advantage for the established parties . Their candidates are automatically certified for the ballots in the 50 states . The federal treasury gives their nominees $29.4 million each with which to run their general election races . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $4.6 million to spend on behalf of their tickets . <P> Still , Anderson and his band of sometimes arrogant but always ardent amateurs plunged in anyway . By the end of the campaign , they had raised some $12 million , mostly by direct-mail appeal , from 217,000 donors . Indeed , they had a list of financial supporters three times larger than the Democratic Party 's and had proved that they could raise money in $30 and $40 chunks . More remarkable yet , they managed to collect enough signatures in just a few months to put Anderson on the ballot in every state . <P> Ironically , these accomplishments helped doom him in the end . His effort to raise money and get on the ballot so monopolized his time and talent that he was unable to fulfill the most fundamental requirement of all for an independent : giving the electorate a clearly defined reason to vote for him . Instead , Anderson 's campaign spent more tune criticizing Carter 's record and Reagan 's qualifications than in defining the " Anderson difference . " <P> " Anderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says John Sears , Reagan 's former campaign manager . " But he was n't able to elevate himself from the posture of being the lesser of three evils . Had Anderson been able to articulate some truly new ideas , I think he would have done very well . " Looking further for an explanation of just what went wrong , Edward Coyle , Anderson 's former deputy campaign manager , says , " There was no burning issue that people were outraged about , no issues on which he was right and Reagan and Carter were wrong that he could grab hold of and run on . "
