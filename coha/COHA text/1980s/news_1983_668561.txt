Before Nicholas turned 1 year old , he devoured two bird baths , tore up his front lawn and crashed through a wire fence without injury . He weighed 75 pounds and terrorized the children in his neighborhood of Hull . Until this past weekend , nobody knew what to do about Nicholas . Then the Army recruited him . Nicholas is a dog , part Great Pyrenees , part mongrel . Yesterday , he and 20 other dogs from Massachusetts were flown to Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio , Texas , for six weeks of basic training to prepare for joining the 2400-member Armed Forces Canine Corps . " I guess you could say we ' re looking for a few good dogs , but it ' s more on the order of 600 to 1000 dogs , " said a spokesman for the dog procurement team . Military officials say breeding the dogs is too expensive to do themselves , so every year they take veterinarians on half a dozen trips around the country to buy dogs from private citizens for $250 each . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too big or dangerous or expensive for their owners to handle , " said Sgt. Daniel Nauertz of the Lackland base . " Of course , every once in a while somebody sells us a dog and then decides they miss him and want him back . " But once we ' ve trained them for protection and attack , it ' s too late . They ' re ours . " Nauertz said the Army also buys smaller dogs - beagles and terriers - to sniff out bombs and drugs . " They go into the Secret Service , the FBI , overseas , " he said . " Why , one of these dogs from Massachusetts could end up protecting the White House . " All of this is very consoling to the Averill family of Hull , Nicholas ' former owners . " When we first got him last Christmas , he was this tiny ball of white fur , the most adorable thing you ever saw , " said Barbara Averill . Within months , however , Nicholas had grown so large that he took up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When my husband took him out for a walk , it wasn ' t too clear who was walking whom . " The family tried to find him another home through an adoption center - " We were hoping for a farm , so he would have enough space , " Averill said - but most people who saw the dog said he was too aggressive and barked too much . " I don ' t even like to think about the other alternatives , but our vet told us he was going to keep growing . " Then the Army recruiters came to Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford last weekend . They ran a battery of tests on the dogs that included firing a gun behind their backs . Dozens of other dogs were frightened by the shots and yelped or ran . Nicholas lunged for the gun . " The recruiters told us they ' re going to spend $14,000 to feed and train him , " Averill said . " So I figure this is the life for him . Yesterday was the first day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Averill spent the day vacuuming up dog hairs and cleaning dog toys out of the backyard . She remembered how family members were able to leave all their windows open without fear on hot summer nights because Nicholas would protect them from any intruders , and how he loved to drapehimself over their laps , unaware of how much he weighed . " The last time we saw him , he was sedated and muzzled for the trip to Texas , and we all cried and cried and said how much we would miss him and how empty the house would be and how we would never have another dog again , " Averill said . " But the truth of the matter is , we ' re very relieved . He ' s perfect for the Army . "
