In his fourth book Robert Ward has attempted to update a half-forgotten relic of the ' 30s : the proletarian novel , with its idealized workers and smokestack suburbs . Ward 's contemporary laborers are not moved by Woody Guthrie 's lyrics ; they rock to Mick Jagger and Aretha Franklin . They are not Dead End slum dwellers ; they are Viet Nam vets and night-school dropouts . Their collars may be blue , but their lives run in the black : sheepskin jackets and vacations at the beach . <P> When hundreds of Baltimore steelworkers are laid off from their assembly line in the winter of 1983 , however , the comfort abruptly collapses , leaving a wake of rage . Some blame the Japanese or the Government ; all confront the terrifying reality that they have what are euphemistically called " nontransferrable skills . " At first , hard-drinking Red Baker , former high school basketball star now turning 40 , buries his fear . Each day he sees Wanda , his wife of 19 years , off to her waitressing job , and plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a family man , " he tells himself , " keep your eye on the bright days ahead . " <P> But in the row houses , the bait shops and car lots of Baltimore 's back streets , jobs are identities ; unemployment strips souls down to their working parts . Among the city 's new office buildings , Red views another America that " had been pushing me and my friends all along , and we had been so caught up in just staying alive , that we had never once pushed back . " <P> Ward has no manifesto and wisely refuses to use Red as a convenient symbol of the wronged working class . With patience and faith , his hero emerges cold- forged by tragedy , observing that what sets one man apart from another is not brains or money but " what he will risk for love . " Ward has taken a similar chance in an age of upwardly mobile fiction . Passion informs every page of this tale without cheapening or glorifying its difficult subjects . They may not build ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product that any working fella can damn well be proud of .
