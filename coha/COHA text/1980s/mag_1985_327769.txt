Just as qualifying trials began for next week 's Indianapolis 500 , the illustrious class of 1965 lost Gordon Johncock , a two-time winner . His car was ready : it had been running near the front at over 210 m.p.h . But the driver was out of tune and time . " That morning I lay there in bed thinking about everything . All of a sudden I sat up and said , ' That 's it for me . ' " Mario Andretti , a classmate present later at Johncock 's valedictory press conference , called his friend 's retirement " clever , " an odd word . " I 've always thought of race-car drivers as being clever or stupid , " Andretti explained . " I 'm still trying to figure out which we are . " <P> Twenty years ago , Andretti finished third , Johncock fifth and Al Unser ninth in their first Indy , when a bumper haul of eleven rookies made the field of 33 and five finished in the top ten . " An eternity ago , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing . " It does n't seem that long " to Unser , 45 , who at first professed to understand Johncock 's decision . " No , that 's not fair , " he amended . " I do n't understand it . I have n't done it . " This is the usual difficulty in discussing anything about auto racing . No one who has n't done it can quite understand it . <P> Sixteen years since his only victory , Andretti will start the 69th Indy 500 from the second row , just behind Pole-Sitter Pancho Carter and just ahead of Unser . Sons Al Unser Jr . and Michael Andretti will follow in the fourth and fifth rows of brilliantly painted cars scattered three abreast across the asphalt track . A circus kind of calling , racing regularly summons more than one generation of the same family , though these are the only fathers and sons who have ever raced together at Indianapolis . In his christening two years ago , Al Jr. , 23 , brought a smile to the speedway during the closing laps by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behalf of Runner-Up Al Sr. Last May , Mario welcomed Michael to the life with a short glance across the row they shared . " I do n't have any first memory of my father , the race driver , " says Michael , 22 , " because that 's my whole memory . Ever since people started asking me what I wanted to be when I grew up , there has been only one answer . " <P> " I 'm happy but I 'm not happy , " his father mutters . " I do n't like to talk about the downside of racing , but obviously I 'm guilty of getting him involved . ' Guilty ' may not be the right word . But it 's the only one I can think of . In my whole life , I 've let myself get really close to just three drivers . They 're all dead . " One was another of the Indy rookies of 1965 , Billy Foster , killed two years later in a stock car . " But on the upside , my son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . All along he 's been a passenger on this road . Now he 's a driver . He 's beginning to see . "
