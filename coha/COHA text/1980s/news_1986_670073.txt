When P. Landis Keyes of Ann Arbor , Mich. , set out to buy a car last month , he had a $17 , 000 budget and a good idea of what he wanted : a compact Toyota Camry . So when a saleswoman suggested a Toyota Cressida for $19 , 500 before taxes , Mr. Keyes balked . To his amazement , however , the dealer sold him the luxury Cressida for $16 , 500 , taxes included . " They took my offer , " Mr. Keyes said . " I was very surprised . " An increasing number of new-car buyers are finding that , for the first time in years , they can do some negotiating on the price of Japanese imports . Meanwhile , import dealers are discovering they have to work harder to sell cars . Although Japanese auto makers will easily sell all the 2. 3 million cars they are planning to ship to the U.S. this year , early signs indicate that they won ' t be doing it completely on their own terms as they have in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market for imports is tighter , says Clifford G. Schmillen , executive vice president for Honda Motor Co. ' s American sales arm . " It ' s a full-time thought pattern for us these days . And although nothing that drastic has happened with our company yet , as you get on down the line the effects are going to be more and more visible . It ' s simply a matter of buyer education . " The most important thing buyers are learning is that the increasing value of the yen has driven up Japanese-car prices by an average of about 15% in the past several months . The higher costs are beginning to turn some customers to domestic makes and prompting some Japanese-auto dealers to become more flexible on prices to avoid losing sales . Imports are also being hurt by stiffer competition at the low end of the market and by Detroit ' s continuing incentives and improving image . In June , those factors helped lower sales of Japanese imports to 189 , 283 autos from 194 , 073 a year earlier , a 2. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , down from 21% a year ago . Inventories of Japanese makes grew to a 37-day supply at the end of June , up from a 22-day supply a year ago , according to Ward ' s Automotive Reports , an industry research concern . A 60-day supply is considered comfortable . To be sure , Japanese auto makers are still very successful . In part , their higher inventories also reflect a relaxation last year of quotas on exports to the U.S. In the first half of 1986 , the Japanese share of the U.S. market increased to 19. 7% ( including Japanese models made here ) from 17. 9% in the first half of 1985 . The Big Three auto makers , while raising prices slightly themselves , have had to offer continual incentives to hold their own positions , and American consumers ' basic love affair with Japanese cars hasn ' t abated . " It is clearly too soon to call it a start of a fundamental down trend of Japanese sales , " says Michael M. Luckey , automotive analyst for Shearson Lehman Bros . Inc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealership in Atlanta , has seen enough : His outlet is selling only about 50 cars a month , down from about 90 a month a year ago . Now , he is fighting the decline with incentives . " Usually imports don ' t have to offer ( sales ) incentives , but now we ' re right up there with the domestic cars , " says Mr. Watts . The dealership ' s lures include the big sales banners typical of domestic-car dealerships and an offer to pick up customers ' first three months of car payments . " Basically , we ' re turning it into a real circus , " he says . For most import dealers , the changes in the market haven ' t required such drastic steps . But many are finding that they can ' t simply pass along to customers all of the Japanese manufacturers ' price increases . Many dealers have had to reduce or eliminate the hefty markups that they once slapped on all their cars ; some are even cutting manufacturers ' list prices . Back orders at many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sales people have to become more aware of selling again , " says Julie Bailey , general sales manager at the Toyota dealership that sold Mr. Keyes his car . " It ' s no longer just order-taking . We haven ' t changed our prices here . But we don ' t have the order bank we once had . " The dealership now has 20 orders , down from a stockpile of as many as 200 in the past several years . Allen Titensor , assistant sales manager at Oldsmobile and Honda dealerships in Salt Lake City , Utah , says his Honda sales representatives are discounting some models below the manufacturer ' s suggested price . " Traditionally , we wouldn ' t even discuss the price of the car , " Mr. Titensor says . " We ' d set it , and that ' s it . Very few people would resist that , and then they ' d wait three months " for the car . Now , he explains , the waiting list has diminished and there is " more dickering over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George , Utah , was less than satisfied when one of Mr. Titensor ' s salesmen offered to take $800 off the $12 , 600 sticker price of a Honda Accord LX , four-door compact . " I was hoping to go maybe $500 ( lower ) than that , and I told them ' no ' on the deal . But later I went and bought it , " he says . Bruce Weisensel  --  an administrator at a Lansing , Mich. , hospital  --  felt emboldened enough to challenge the price that a salesman was asking last month for a new Mazda 626 , also a compact sedan . By playing off the Mazda salesman against a nearby Honda dealer , telling each about the deals the other was willing to make , Mr. Weisensel was able to get his Mazda for about $600 less than the asking price . Japanese-make dealers are facing perhaps their stiffest challenge in the least-expensive end of the auto market : subcompacts . Hyundai Motor America , a South Korean car maker , began exporting its new Excel model to the U.S. this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 995 . Sales of more than 52 , 000 cars so far this year , the company says , have already broken the previous first-year sales record for a new U.S. import , set by Regie Nationale des Usines Renault in 1958 . And sales of Chrysler Corp. ' s Omni and Horizon subcompacts have almost doubled since May , when the company introduced the lower-priced America models . Starting price : $5 , 499 . Says one top U.S. executive of a Japanese auto maker : " July and August will be a very good test , since they ' re traditionally good months for imports . Many dealers last year had zero inventories . But that may never happen again . " Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
