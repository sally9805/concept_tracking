Now it is making a last-ditch effort  --  literally . For one thing , the Immigration and Naturalization Service will expand its force of border patrolmen by a third , to 4,300 , by year 's end . On top of that , the INS announced last week that it plans to dig a $2 million ditch along a four-mile stretch of border near San Diego , where some 300,000 illegal aliens were apprehended last year . INS officials maintain that the ditch , 5 ft. deep and 14 ft. wide , will frustrate high-speed car dashes across the border , which now average 400 a month , and * also help correct drainage problems in the area . A report by the Federation for American Immigration Reform supported the idea of the ditch . " Locking uninvited gate-crashers out , " it said , " is just good common sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . " Associate Attorney General Francis Keating has come up with a nickname for the big hole : " Our buried Berlin Wall . "
