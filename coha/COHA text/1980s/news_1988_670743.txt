The changes in busing and student assignments , to be voted on Wednesday by the Boston School Committee , would bring control of the Boston schools back to city officials after years of stringent court supervision . For parents , the changes , if adopted as expected , could mean a greater choice of schools for their children and shorter bus rides. // And for some Bostonians , the measures would end a divisive , frustrating chapter in the city ' s history and offer a fresh chance to improve the public schools. // // ' A Historic Opportunity ' // " The student assignment plan is a historic opportunity for Boston to move forward in giving parents choice and restoring confidence in public education , " said Mayor Raymond L. Flynn , who has been pushing hard for the adoption of the plan. // Few politicians , educators or parents are happy with Boston ' s public schools , which cost about $400 million a year to operate for 57 , 000 pupils. // A focal point of the dissatisfaction has been busing . In the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the makeup of the population of the public schools . In 1972 about 60 percent of the students were white , as against just 24 percent today. // As a result , the busing system now involves " shuffling black children across the city to a mediocre school to attend a school with other black children , " said John A. Nucci , president of the Boston School Committee , who has supported busing to desegregate the schools. // Student test scores in reading and mathematics have improved marginally in recent years , but not fast enough to satisfy anyone . Nearly 40 percent of the system ' s ninth-graders , or about 1 , 870 students , will drop out before graduation , recent estimates show. // One continuing sore point is the condition of the school buildings . " We have some of the worst-looking schools in the country , " said Laval S. Wilson , the School Superintendent . <> <> Push for Local School Power // There is more on the table than school assignments . Mr. Wilson is facing a movement started by city officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give more power to individual schools at the expense of school administrators. // The idea , " school-based management , " is that principals and teachers know what is best for the students in their schools and should be permitted to make more curriculum and budget decisions . These principals and teachers would be held accountable for their actions and the educational results , advocates say. // But some people are not as optimistic that the changes can upgrade the system , one that has seen seven superintendents and nearly as many educational approaches in the last 15 years. // " Parents in Boston have no confidence in the Boston School Committee , " said James Kelly , a City Council member who was a leader of the anti-busing movement of the 1970 ' s. // The student assignment plan centers on the emotional issue of where students attend school . Since 1975 , children have been assigned a particular school in line with a desegregation plan imposed by Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr. after finding that the school system knowingly pursued discriminatory policies. // When the judge ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several public schools and boycotts that tore apart the city . More than half of Boston ' s public school students are bused , some over long distances . Judge Garrity ' s ruling prompted thousands of white parents to remove their children from the public schools. // The courts have gradually relaxed their grip on the school system , and in September 1987 a Federal appeals court ruled that Boston had done everything it could to desegregate the schools , given their changed racial composition . <> <> A Choice of Schools // Under the plan being considered by the School Committee , students and parents would have more of a choice about schools , and many could choose a school within walking distance of their homes. // If the School Committee adopts the plan Wednesday , it intends to introduce it gradually beginning next September . The plan requires state approval , which is expected . It may also need Judge Garrity ' s assent , although there is disagreement on that. // Public debate about the future of the school system is far more low key than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city. // How Boston has changed can also be seen in who is running the city . Mayor Flynn , who as a state legislator from South Boston vigorously opposed busing , has made racial tolerance a high priority since election to his first term in 1983 . There are now blacks on the City Council and on the School Committee , a black woman is running the Boston Housing Authority and Mr. Wilson , who is black , is the School Superintendent. // Perhaps the biggest change has occurred in the school system itself . When black parents brought suit in in 1972 charging that the School Committee discriminated against their children , the system had 96 , 000 students , about 60 percent white. // Since then , the number of students has dropped to 57 , 000 . In a city where 60 percent of the 600 , 000 residents are white , only 24 percent of public school students are white , as against 48 percent who are black , 19 percent Hispanic and 8 percent of Asian descent. // The dramatic decrease in the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance in the schools. // The proposed plan to provide more choice is an attempt to reduce the long-distance busing while retaining desegregation as a goal . It would encourage improvements in educational quality by giving parents a chance to select schools. // The consultants who prepared the plan are Charles V. Willie , a Harvard University professor , and Michael J. Alves , former director for desegregation assistance of the Massachusetts Department of Education. // The proposal splits the city into three zones - east , west and north - of about 14 , 000 students each . The plan , which would affect kindergarten through eighth grade , would permit students to choose any of about 20 schools in the zone where they live . The consultants argue that this competitive shopping process by parents will force unpopular schools to shape up or face shake-ups or closure. // To most parents , though , what really matters is what goes on inside the school building. // " Unless they improve the quality of education , they haven ' t done anything , " said Hattie McKinnis , executive director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
