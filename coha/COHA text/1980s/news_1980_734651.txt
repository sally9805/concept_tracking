txt ARE YOU READY for spring ? I never am , It comes upon us so suddenly . Just as we 've all had our fill of winter , suddenly the trees burst Into fresh green finery and every item in our wardrobes seems old and dreary . It 's a good time to perk up the wardrobe with something new and springy . How about a terrific new crocheted handbag ? They 're quick and easy to make and the variations are limited only by your imagination . ? Spring seems to be the season for carrying things around , and , just by varying its size , this crocheted bag can become a generous-size tote with an eye towards beach season . Or go to the opposite extreme : Make it tiny and it becomes a colorful piece of jewelry to be worn around the neck on a twisted cord . A little bigger and it 's a disco bag . Or a change purse . The choice is yours ! Yarn choice is yours , too , and never was it so wide . Stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy cottons , shiny silks , butcher string , even ribbons , cords , and raffia . Nearly anything flexible enough to crochet will do . DO N'T OVERLOOK bits and pieces of strings and yarns you may have around the house . They can add stripes of color and texture to your bag . Woolly yarns might be a bit too wintery for a spring bag , particularly in deep colors . But if you have some brights around , they might do ? especially if you combine them with some springy-looking cotton yarns . So pack away your serious leather handbags and make a whole wardrobe of fresh new ones . The ecru " string " yarns are a natural ( no pun intended ! ) for spring , and bags made from them will go with everything in your closet . Or combine colors to mix and match with your existing wardrobe . Colors can be worked in stripes . Or use two colors at once for a tweed effect . Using two yarns at once also makes a much stronger bag , which is important if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO BEGIN : Rather than give you a specific recipe for a particular bag , I 'm going to explain the concept of a pouch bag . Then you can vary it as easily as a casserole ! This bag is done with the most basic single crochet stitch ? the one you probably learned as a child . If you never did , you can get the basic technique in ColumbiaMinerva 's " Beginners Crochet " or " Learn to Crochet . " Begin by making the base : ? actually a solid circle or " doily , " Chain four stitches into the ring ( your first round ) . Then , in the second round , increase in every stitch ( 12 sc ) ; in the third round , increase every other stitch ( 18 sc ) , then , in every third , fourth , etc . You have to keep adding stitches , as the circle is getting larger . Continue in this way until you get a circle the desired size of the base of your bag . When you reach this point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because your doily ca n't expand " out , " it expands " up , " like a tube . Keep crocheting until the tube is almost as high as you want your finished bag to be . AT THIS POINT , make a row of double crochet mesh . Work one double crochet , chain one and skip one stitch , continuing in this way until you get a fillet " mesh . " This is where your drawstring will go . Top with a few more rows of single crochet and finish off with a decorative edging such as a shell stitch or picot edge .
