Those were Reagan 's final words to Begin , but his message was " outrage " <P> It was a few minutes past 11 o'clock last Thursday morning when the President of the U.S. , after an hour of trying , finally managed to get through by telephone to the Prime Minister of Israel . In a cold fury , Ronald Reagan told Menachem Begin of his " outrage " that at the very moment when a negotiated settlement for the evacuation of Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas appeared to be in sight , the Israeli armed forces were conducting their most severe air blitz of West Beirut . Virtually shouting , the President said that he was " shocked " at the Israeli attack , which he said had caused " needless destruction and bloodshed . " The Israeli Prime Minister seemed incredulous , although in fact he had been expecting the President 's call and dreading it . Begin assured Reagan that he had already ordered another cease-fire in Beirut . The two men spoke again about 20 minutes later , and , somewhat encouraged , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Using the customary Hebrew greeting ( " Peace " ) , he said farewell to Begin : " Menachem , shalom . " <P> Those extraordinary conversations ended one of the ugliest and most inexplicable actions of the ten-week war . In the hills southeast of Beirut , U.S. Negotiator Philip Habib had already secured an agreement in principle that would lead to the evacuation from Lebanon of the 6,000 to 9,000 P.L.O . fighting men in West Beirut . He had just about completed the arrangements for the transfer of the departing P.L.O . forces to other Arab countries , leaving only a few relatively unimportant details still to be settled . The Israelis knew he was making progress , yet they continued to bomb and shell West Beirut on Monday , Tuesday and Wednesday . <P> Finally , on Thursday , they launched the most intensive bombardment of the war . For eleven hours , from 6 a.m. until 5 p.m. , Israeli warplanes-more than 60 , according to Beirut reports-dropped their pay loads of death and destruction on the besieged city , making some 220 bombing runs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined in the attack . By the time the cease-fire went into effect in late afternoon , at least 156 people had been killed and some 400 wounded . Some 800 dwellings had been destroyed . <P> Inevitably , the Thursday attack brought an abrupt halt to the peace talks . Lebanese Prime Minister Chafik al Wazzan , who had been serving as an intermediary between the P.L.O . and the American negotiators , declared that he could no longer continue to participate while his " beloved Beirut " was being bombarded . With tears of outrage in his eyes , the Prime Minister told Habib that if the Israelis were bent on destroying Beirut and its people , " then let them kill us all now and get it over with , and let you and the U.S. bear the consequences . " Wazzan 's performance was both heartfelt and effective . So was the telephone call that P.L.O . Chairman Yasser Arafat made that day to Saudi Arabia 's King Fahd , asking for his assistance in stopping the onslaught . Enraged by what Arafat told him about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the carnage cease . And so he did , reaching the White House scarcely ten minutes before Reagan got through to Begin .
