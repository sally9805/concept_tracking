While interest groups throughout the country were digesting President Reagan 's economic plan last week and groping toward protest or endorsement , labor leaders were practically organized for the occasion . Reagan 's speech coincided with the winter meeting of the AFL-CIO executive council , a group made up of heads of 32 major unions representing 13.6 million workers . Skies were cloudy above the Bal Harbour , Fla. , meeting , which was dominated by behind-the-scenes discussion of Reagan 's program . <P> Generally , and perhaps expectably , the reviews were bad . " A high-risk gamble with the future of America " was AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland 's verdict . Said he : " Workers and the poor take the lion 's share of the risk . The only sure winners are the wealthy , whether they are individuals or corporations . " Echoed Jerry Wurf , president of the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees : " What we are seeing is the beginning of an Administration that will do two things-reward the rich and screw the poor . " William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving the Reagan program a chance-if only to show workers how insensitive a Republican regime can be . Noted Winpisinger : " This is not a society accustomed to austerity . " <P> Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker and U.S. Special Trade Representative Bill Brock brought White House assurances that the Administration would listen to labor . Yet their presence had little effect on the general mood of high anxiety . Indeed , Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan created some of his own . After an hour-and-a-half meeting with the council , Donovan emerged to tell the press : " Many stood up and said , ' Give the President a chance . ' " How many ? Donovan " sensed " about half . Some labor leaders present had a different count . " Nobody stood up , " said Glenn Watts , head of the Communications Workers . Not an auspicious beginning for a Labor Secretary . <P> The AFL-CIO asserts that the President 's policies will bring misery to its members and , in the end , cost more than a million jobs . So the labor leaders are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They would prefer to lower federal budget deficits by reducing interest rates through selective credit controls and reduce unemployment through direct jobs programs . They are flatly opposed to such pet Republican proposals as a subminimum wage for teen-agers and the dismantling of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration . In addition , the union believes that individual tax cuts should be focused on middle-and lower-income groups through a 20% reduction in Social Security taxes . <P> But the AFL-CIO is likely to have its own problems in selling a program . At present , it is a house divided among 105 unions that include conservative construction workers , government employees , garment workers who make an average of $6,500 a year and airline pilots who sometimes earn more than $100,000 . As a result , Reagan 's promises of tax relief last November were appealing to many of the nation 's better-paid union members . Though the AFL-CIO officially supported Carter , many among the rank and file refused to go along . In a postelection poll of working-class wards and precincts , the AFL-CIO found that only 58% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
