WASHINGTON  --  Calling budget deficits " the unwanted and unpleasant stepchild of Reaganomics , " the president ' s task force on the Oct. 19 stock market crash pointed to government red ink as a major cause . The report put concerns about the budget and trade shortfalls first in a list of six " events in world financial markets that laid the groundwork for a significant correction " in the stock market . Before the report ' s release , administration officials indicated that the Brady task force would cite Wall Street , rather than government policies , as the cause of the crash . But in fact , the report suggests the administration ' s budget policies deserve a portion of the blame . The five other developments highlighted by the task force were : instability in the foreign exchange markets ; a rise in interest rates ; a House Ways and Means Committee proposal to restrict takeovers ; an excess supply of stock overseas ; and changes in political leadership , including the transition at the Federal Reserve from the former chairman , Paul Volcker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the task force said the ultimate effects of the stock market decline on the economy are " highly uncertain . " And it concluded that the likelihood of a depression similar to the one that followed the 1929 crash is " only a remote possibility . " In a section of the report entitled " The Economic Impact of the Market Collapse , " the task force noted that significant declines in stock prices in 1948 , 1957 , 1969 , 1973 and 1981 presaged recessions . But it also pointed out that a 29% drop in stock prices in 1946 and a 28% decline in 1962 weren ' t followed by economic downturns . And while acknowledging that the stock market drop is likely to damp consumer and business spending , the report said those could be offset by the expansionary effect of the declines in interest rates and the dollar that followed the market crash . More than three quarters of Americans don ' t directly own any stock , the report said , and just 10% account for 90% of all stock holdings . As a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline on consumers is limited . Moreover , most new business investment is funded by debt rather than equity . As a result , the depressing effect of lower stock prices on investment could be easily offset by the stimulus of lower interest rates , the report said . The task force rejected arguments that the deficit-cutting package recently passed by Congress would have any significant economic effects . The package " will no more than offset the increase in the deficit that would otherwise have occurred , " the report said . In comparing the recent market collapse to that of 1929 , the task force argued that the economy " appears to be far more stable than it was in 1929 . " It noted that agriculture and manufacturing , which are susceptible to cyclical swings in global activity , account for far less of the U.S. economy now than they did in 1929 . It also pointed out that government activity , which acts to counter cyclical economic downturns , is far greater than it was in the 1920s . Moreover , the report said the 1920s was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen prices rising at a pace of 4% to 5% annually . The task force concluded that the Great Depression wasn ' t caused by the stock market crash , but by the " interaction of a number of diverse circumstances , such as the declines in agriculture and housing , and misguided policies , such as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff , the tight monetary policy in late 1931 and the tax increase in the summer of 1932 .
