The searchers knew that they had nearly run out of luck . " If there are any more out there alive it would be a miracle , " said Volunteer Jos de Jesus Lerna after several of the rescued had died . " Death is now unchallenged in Armero . " <P> As the gripping drama of the rescue effort gradually gave way to exhaustion and a sense of futility , stunned Colombians turned their attention to assessing the damage and rebuilding their lives .
