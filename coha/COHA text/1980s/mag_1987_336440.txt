Only one railroad line runs the 250 miles from Manila to Naga , a city of 100,000 people located on the narrow , volcano-filled Bicol peninsula . Early last week that line was dramatically severed as 500 men , dressed in military fatigues and believed to be guerrillas of the Communist New People 's Army , hijacked a train bound from Naga to the capital . They commandeered it to the town of Del Gallego and attacked the local constabulary headquarters , killing at least five policemen and three civilians . To cover their rear , the rebels blew up a key railroad bridge and effectively cut off train service between the capital and the rest of the peninsula . <P> The hijacking seemed to be the latest attempt by the N.P.A. to wrest the strategic region from President Corazon Aquino 's government , which was shaken and nearly toppled on Aug. 28 by a violent military mutiny . In the past four weeks alone , the Communist rebels have dynamited four bridges and torn up railway tracks along the Manila-Naga line . " It looks like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said a Western military analyst . Some politicians warned that the N.P.A. might soon isolate Bicol from Manila and form a provisional government . <P> In addition to its strategic position , the region is politically important to Aquino , having heavily favored her over former Dictator Ferdinand Marcos in the disputed 1986 presidential election . At last week 's Cabinet meeting  --  the first gathering of that body since Aquino purged it of some of its more controversial members  --  the President vowed to " look very carefully into the Bicol area . " <P> Rebel activity in Bicol , as elsewhere , has sharply escalated in the month since loyal generals headed by Armed Forces Chief Fidel Ramos put down the military rebellion . The number of armed clashes with the Communist rebels is up 140% , while the government 's military casualties have increased from a daily average of three to 4.4 . Seeking to bolster the efficiency and loyalty of her army , Aquino early last week authorized a middle-level military reshuffle to replace 21 officers , some of whom are thought to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the changes was the official cashiering of Colonel Gregorio ( " Gringo " ) Honasan from his command of special operations at a provincial fort . Honasan , the leader of the failed revolt , remained at large with as many as 2,000 renegade troops . According to press reports , Honasan has been secretly slipping in and out of Manila under the protection of military guards . Members of the business community may now be funding him , and some observers predicted he would launch a new coup attempt within a few weeks . If so , he could win support among government troops and officers , a majority of whom continue to sympathize with Honasan 's professed goals of an all-out offensive against the N.P.A. and higher living standards for soldiers . There was even speculation that the well-organized Bicol attacks were Honasan 's work . Indeed , late last week the N.P.A. denied responsibility for the bombings and hinted that Honasan may be trying to set up his own power base .                @ @ @ @ @
