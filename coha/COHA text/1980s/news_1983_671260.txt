" // But four of her children - Alvin , Earl , Johnnie May and Carolyn - disappointed her by dropping out of high school .

But today , Mrs. Rivers said , " you can ' t find no jobs - ain ' t no jobs. " // Schools , she said , are " a little better . " But because " they got it zoned off , " there are still schools that are all black or all white. // " We wanted better housing , but they ain ' t getting better .
