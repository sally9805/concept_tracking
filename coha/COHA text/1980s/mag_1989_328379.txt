" Stead 's celebrated book was indeed lengthy and imperfect . But it had at its center an unforgettable father figure whose weakness and tyrannical urges were disguised by forced jollity . Francis Clemmons , the dear old dad of Joan Chase 's lyric second novel ( her first , During the Reign of the Queen of Persia , won PEN 's Ernest Hemingway Foundation Award in 1984 ) , also has an unnerving gift of gab .

Margy is a full-figured twelve-year-old with well-developed defenses against rutting boys .

Men seem interested in only one thing , or at least in one thing at a time , while Chase 's women demonstrate a more integrated notion of events and emotions . <P> Whatever the biological or social truth of Wolves , the novel 's artistic conviction can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nuance , unexpected humor and explosive strength that can already be quickly and appreciatively distinguished as the Chase style .
