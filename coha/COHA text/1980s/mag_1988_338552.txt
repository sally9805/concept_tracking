When Leslie Manigat emerged as the victor in Haiti 's presidential elections last January , it was assumed that the former political exile would act as a puppet for the outgoing military junta led by Lieut . General Henri Namphy . But last week it was the puppet who pulled the strings . In a communique read over Haitian television and radio , Manigat dismissed Namphy as Commander in Chief of the army for " insubordination " and fired two other generals on Namphy 's staff . <P> The power struggle broke into the open when Manigat rescinded an order by Namphy to transfer and retire several top-ranking officers loyal to the government . After Namphy defied the repeal , Manigat moved against him , but the President may have to pull a few more strings before he can prove that he is in full control .
