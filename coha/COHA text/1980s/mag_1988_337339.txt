+ History , in Karl Marx 's famed dictum , happens twice : the first time as tragedy , the second time as farce . Haitians experienced tragedy in November when soldiers and thugs murdered some 50 people and halted the country 's first free presidential elections in 30 years . When the polls opened again last week , the result was closer to farce . The country 's four leading populist candidates refused to run , and less than 10% of Haiti 's 3 million voters turned out for the election , which was held amid a boycott called by opposition leaders . Election officials examined each vote before dropping it in the box . Ballot stuffing appeared to be widespread . <P> The big winner seemed to be Leslie Manigat , 57 , a former political science professor who fled Haiti during the Duvalier dictatorship and spent 23 years in exile in France and Venezuela . A preliminary tally indicated that Manigat won slightly more than 50% of the vote . Brigadier General Henri Namphy , head of the country 's three-man military junta , initially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support of the junta 's Brigadier General Williams Regala and another top military leader . " Manigat could only get to where he has got through an obscure , rigged situation , " says a Haitian social scientist . " He would like only to be President . He has no other agenda . " <P> Candidates Gregoire Eugene and Gerard Philippe-Auguste denounced the preliminary results and threatened to show proof of fraud . The Reagan Administration , which halted $78.7 million in aid to Haiti after last November 's bloodbath , acknowledged that the voting was not " fully free and open " but noted that the U.S. " is gratified that these elections took place in an atmosphere free of violence . " In the same vein , though officials contended the U.S. will not resume economic and military aid until Haiti becomes more democratic , they indicated they could work with Manigat . <P> If Manigat is finally declared the winner , he will be sworn in as President on Feb. 7 . For Haiti 's junta , meanwhile , it was business as usual . Police arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from criticizing the government on a trip abroad and charged him with fomenting civil war . Dejoie was released two days later after hundreds of protesters demonstrated outside the National Penitentiary , where he was being held .
