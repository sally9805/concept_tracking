Welcome to the brave new world of night golf . It 's a pastime recently made possible  --  though some might say just barely  --  by the Nitelite Golfball , an invention of the Newcombs , a father-and-son team from Mirror Lake , N.H. // " It 's primarily for twilight play , " says 61-year-old Nelson F. Newcomb . " It 's for the golfer who wants to sneak in nine holes after a day 's work . " // About a year and a half ago Newcomb and his son , Corky , 35 , figured out a way to make a golf ball glow in the dark . They call their invention the Nitelite . It 's a translucent , hard plastic sphere that has a thin cylindrical hole molded into it , and into that the golfer inserts a small light-stick made of Cyalume , a luminescent material used in the production of emergency highway markers and disco jewelry . Each lightstick glows coolly for about six hours . // The ball has been on the market for two months . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lightstick does not affect the ball 's flight , and it putts beautifully . " To help golfers locate the green in the failing light , the Newcombs also sell larger lightsticks , to be placed at the 150-yard mark on the fairway and tied onto the flags at each hole . // Ingenious ? Perhaps . But during the last decade the Newcombs have also marketed Nitelite footballs , plastic softballs , tennis balls and fishing lures  --  not to mention the flat-sided baseball that enables anyone to throw a curve , screwball , sinker or slider. // " People kept calling and asking why we did n't have a golf ball , " says Corky . The ball , which sells for $4.95 plus $1 for each lightstick refill , was first turned on at the PGA convention , and it was voted most innovative new product by Golf Industry magazine . Despite its popularity , it is unlikely that the United States Golf Association will declare the Nitelite legal for regulation play . According to Frank Thomas , the USGA 's technical director , the ball seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Section 14-3 of the Rules of Golf concerning " artificial devices and unusual equipment " to help the golfer track down errant shots . " What if two golfers are playing at dusk and one player pulls this ball out ? " says Thomas . " He would have an unfair advantage ; he would be able to find his ball when the other fellow could n't . We turned down a ball with a little radio transmitter in it for the same reason . " // Still , concedes Thomas , as a novelty the Nitelite wo n't damage the game . // " We 've been going crazy over this thing , " says Claude Pardue , co-owner of the Hyland Hills Golf Resort near Pinehurst , N.C. The course staffers , too busy to play during the day , have been holding grudge matches after sundown . " Darkness is a great equalizer , " says Pardue , a 12-handicapper who claims to have regularly beaten better players after dark . " For one thing , reading the green is absolutely impossible , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In April , Pardue enticed 35 course regulars to sign up for a tournament , the first annual Hyland Hills Night Classic . " We had cocktails at 7:30 p.m. and a shotgun start at 8:00 . We played 12 holes before midnight , and not a single ball was lost . " Pardue does n't plan to open the course to unsupervised night play , though . " Somebody could fall into a sand trap , " he says , " or get lost . " // Jeff Short , teaching pro at Los Angeles ' Rancho Park , agrees . " You really have to know the course , " he said on a test round . Doglegs tend to be fairly unfathomable in total darkness , and one ball hit into the trees required an antique reliance on the ear to narrow the search . // Short found the hard plastic Nitelite traveled about 40 yards less than a regular ball on drives . " That 's bad for the golfer 's ego , " he said . On the plus side , however , his ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light undimmed by even the heaviest rough . Short also recommended placing a lightstick in the hole before putting . " It makes the hole look twice as big . You ca n't miss . " // Can the same be said for night golf ? Will dawn starting times become simply an unpleasant memory ? Probably not . " It was fun , " said Short , as he headed toward the clubhouse at 10 p.m . " But after this round , I feel a lot more tired than usual . "
