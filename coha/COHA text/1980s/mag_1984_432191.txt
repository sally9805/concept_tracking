 | From a tangle of hoses and tubes , amid the gentle whirr and hiss of pumps , William J. Schroeder stood up and took a few steps last week , a sight to make everyone 's heart skip a beat ? everyone 's except his own . Sterile , inert , indifferent to the nerves blinking unanswered in his chest , his man-made heart beat to its own implacable rhythm . For the second time in history , there is an externally powered human being among us , an electromechanical chimera , riveting us with his courage ? and forcing us by his presence to think about the lives we are changing with our machines . For his surgeon , Dr. William C. DeVries , it was a small step toward proving that man can make a heart almost as good as any that grows , and a vindication of his own controversial decision to move into private practice at the Humana Inc. hospital in Louisville from the University of Utah Medical Center where he performed the first artificial-heart implant just two years ago . For society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no less pressing than the ones posed by the unsuccessful baboonheart transplant into Baby Fae just four weeks earlier . For Schroeder , a retired government worker from Jasper , Ind. , it meant a strange new sensation in his chest and a new sound to grow accustomed to , the reassuring click of the metallic valves that measure out his life 's blood . In " All the King 's Men , " Robert Penn Warren writes about driving down a country road in the rain , the windshield wipers " making their busy little gasp and click like something inside you which had better not stop " ; which of us , if he could hear his own heart valves open and shut , would ever listen to anything else ? Still , the remarkable thing was that Schroeder was alive at all . He was a Class IV heart patient when surgery began early Sunday morning ? bedridden , gasping , his heart barely pumping , scarred ( despite a double-bypass operation in 1983 ) into uselessness by a chronic shortage of cardiac circulation . Without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the usual limit for a human-heart transplant ? would probably not have lived out the weekend . As it was , he had a close call the evening after his surgery , when a suture where the heart joined the aorta sprang a leak , and , before it could be repaired , spilled eight pints of blood into his chest . Four days later , his wife , Margaret , appeared at a press conference with all six of their grown children and said she had n't seen her husband looking so good in months ; he had been " fading away from me , " she said , " and now I feel I have him back again . " While authorities in the field of medical ethics gravely weighed his " quality of life , " the patient himself , irrelevantly glad just to be alive , was toasting his recovery with a can of beer . Pressure : Later in the week he grew tired , though , compounding the problem his doctors faced in arriving at any useful prognosis . There were reasons to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown it could work for as long as five years . The first one to be installed was still beating after 112 days when the patient , Seattle dentist Barney Clark , died of circulatory collapse . Schroeder started out healthier than Clark , and he benefited from corning second . Clark had suffered grave seizures not long after his surgery , apparently the result of pressure on his brain caused by too much cardiac output . Schroeder 's heart was adjusted to avoid this problem . Yet every time DeVries 's colleague Dr. Allan M. Lansing , who heads the heart institute at Humana Hospital-Audubon , appeared in the press center to report another milestone in Schroeder 's recovery , he tempered it with a warning that Schroeder 's situation could change for the worse at any moment . " I 'll worry about infection as long as he 's alive , " DeVries admitted ; " I worry about valve breakage , and as long as he 's alive I 'll worry about that . " Or , in the words of the heart 's inventor , Dr. Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not very likely these people will die of cancer . " The heart Schroeder received was a Jarvik-7 , virtually identical to the one implanted in Clark . It is about the size of a human heart , and consists of two hollow chambers of polyurethane and aluminum  | ( diagram ) , each containing a flexible plastic diaphragm . Two plastic hoses , routed through incisions in the abdomen , carry compressed air to the heart , alternately swelling and collapsing the diaphragms to pump blood through the pulmonary artery to the lungs and the aorta to the body . When and if Schroeder leaves the hospital , he will spend most of his time tethered by six-foot hoses to a large and cumbersome air compressor , which must be wheeled from room to room . For up to three hours a day , though , he can plug his hoses into a batterypowered Heimes portable driver that weighs less than 12 pounds and is no bigger than a camera bag . Symbion , Inc. , the Salt Lake City company that developed the heart , has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slung jauntily from a shoulder strap , the hoses disappearing discreetly behind his necktie ; Mrs. Schroeder speculated wistfully at her press conference about her husband going for drives with his portable compressor . The Heimes unit , which had never before been used on a human patient , was connected to Schroeder 's heart twice last Friday , once for 22 minutes and later for an hour . In switching drivers there is a moment when the heart must be disconnected from any power source , a situation that apparently is less nerve-racking than it sounds . Schroeder 's heart missed only two or three beats in the process , and he did n't feel it , according to the developer , West German inventor Dr. Peter Heimes . " I think you can miss many more beats than you think you would need , " Heimes said . The major change from Clark 's operation was the setting : Humana Hospital-Audubon , one of the flagships of the giant Humana chain of private hospitals ( box ) with which DeVries became affiliated last August . He has found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartening contrast to the frustrations of academic medicine . " My view , " he said , " is that I have been able to set up this project exactly the way I wanted to , and there have been no questions about what devices cost . " That did not , however , stem the criticism from the medical establishment of the propriety of involving a private corporation in basic research . Arthur Caplan , a senior staff member at New York 's Hastings Center , points out that Humana 's offer to pay for 100 heart implants gives them a potential windfall starting with the 101st patient . Although the surgical techniques ( unlike the heart itself ) can not be patented , the expertise Humana will develop may give it a virtual monopoly on a market Caplan esti- HOW THE JARVIK-7 WORKS Doctors suture the implant to the patient 's atria .

" If this company was genuinely interested in advancing medical knowledge , " says Dr. Arnold Reiman , editor of the New England Journal of Medicine , " it would build a research institute . " Plaque : There are , moreover , those who believe that the artificial heart should never have been developed at all ? that it is a " melodrama , " in the words of Prof. Norman Scotch of the Boston University School of Public Health , which distracts from more important but less glamorous medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the next 15 years are going to be prevention , prevention and prevention , " says Dr. Thomas J. Ryan , president of the American Heart Association . He has in mind developments such as drugs to dissolve plaque deposits on arteries , a project that probably could make use of the $20 million Humana is prepared to spend on implants . To some theorists the real danger with artificial hearts is that they will work , presenting the unwelcome choice of saving the lives of only those who can afford the operation or making them available to everyone , at a potential cost of billions . Medicare will not pay for implants for the foreseeable future ; they are considered an experimental procedure , as are human-heart transplants , despite their impressive success record in recent years . The memory is still fresh , however , of the tragedy of kidney patients who were condemned to a slow z death because they could not afford dialysis ? a situation that moved Congress , in 1972 , specifically to auNEWSWEEK/DECEMBER 10 , 1984 @#  | thorize Medicare to cover them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5,000 patients at a cost of $135 million a year ; currently , more than 70,000 patients are covered and the cost is $2 billion and growing . Consent : The most intractable ethical debate seems to center on the question of " informed consent " ? the patient 's acknowledgment that he is undertaking a procedure that not only has a high risk of failure , but may leave him miserable even if it succeeds . The issue of whether Baby Fae 's parents should have been allowed to choose to prolong her life with the experimental baboon-heart transplant was complicated by the refusal of the hospital in that case to make the informed-consent form public . Schroeder , of course , made the decision for himself , and he signed ? twice , a day apart ? a 17-page document that could not have left much room for optimism . But getting informed consent from a dying man is a delicate proposition , warns John Arras , philosopher-in-residence at Montefiore Medical Center in New York , in light of the " real potential for them to grasp at straws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 112 days ? worth it ? DeVries himself has come down on both sides of the question . Speaking about implants before the Schroeder case , he admitted that " if I thought a patient was going to spend the rest of his days in a hospital , I would think twice about it . " Yet , earlier , discussing Clark , he said firmly that " to say to only live an additional 112 days is unsuccessful is ridiculous . His case was succcessful because he was going to die that day , and he saw Christmas and his birthday and his anniversary , and even the Brigham Young-University of Utah basketball game on television . " Schroeder 's family , as it happened , taped several Indiana basketball games for him to watch when he recovers . In the end , of course , only the patient knows how much suffering it is worth to reach another birthday , and DeVries has been careful to choose patients with a strong will to live .

Yet even Clark , described by his doctors as a " rugged old Rocky Mountain sagebrush , " at a difficult point after the operation asked his doctors , " Why do n't you let me die ? " ? and in one moment of brief irrationality feared that someone was going to shut off the air supply to his artificial heart . The faster Schroeder recovers , the sooner will come the day when he goes home to the new house near the hospital where he will be required to live . He will have his family there , of course ; there may well be another can or two of beer opened in celebration . And then he will go to his bedroom . He will lie down in bed next to his wife . He will switch off the light , close his eyes . . . and listen .
