Can you work through your arguments with your spouse without holding onto resentments ? Do you enjoy being responsible for your own happiness ? Do you work well with bosses , teachers , landlords and other authority figures ? If you answer no to any of these , the source of the problem may be unresolved conflicts with parents , according to psychiatrist Harold Bloomfield , author of " Making Peace with Your Parents ( Random House ) . " He estimates that about half of us have unfinished business with at least one of our parents that is important enough to affect our daily lives and our peace of mind - often in hidden ways . The chronic stress of unresolved emotional hurts can contribute to serious health problems , career and job conflicts , marital problems and reduced vitality , asserts Bloomfield , who completed his psychiatric training at Yale and is a director of the North County Holistic Health Center in Del Mar , Calif . His book focuses on how to forgive parents for the various ways they have hurt us when we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some people say to me , Why should I forgive the so-and-so ? ' I tell them , It ' s for you , not for them . Making peace with your parents is really making peace with yourself , " Bloomfield said in a recent interview . " Forgiving our parents helps keep us from repeating their mistakes with ourselves and our own children . " If we grew up with an overly critical parent , for instance , we may grow up and internalize that voice - being much more critical of ourselves than our parent ever was . " A lot of people treat themselves like criminals , " said Bloomfield . Before you can clear up your relationship with your real-life parents , Bloomfield said , you must first make peace with what he calls the " inner parent " - those internalized messages , feelings and conflicts you carry around inside your head . " Making Peace with your Parents " includes do-it-yourself exercises to help heal such wounds . But can a $14.95 book take the place of a $70 an hour psychologist ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are not in therapy to have more love in their family . If you are in therapy , I think the book can speed up the process . I give my patients four hours of homework for every session we spend together . I don ' t believe that all the work should be confined to the so-called magic hour . " However , Bloomfield does think that a personal therapist can provide feedback and help in overcoming blind spots , which a book can not . And he does not reccommend the book to the tiny fraction of the population that is seriously disturbed . " By that I mean that I wouldn ' t want the person who was severely beaten by his mother to try these visualization exercises while he ' s sitting in a corner of the state mental hospital . " Bloomfield suspects that there is more effort to build bridges across the generation gap these days . " The parents were the bad guys in the ' 60s and the ' 70s . But now the classic nuclear family is another minority group - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing people togther . People can ' t afford the luxury of doing their own thing on their parents ' credit card anymore . " But how does someone make the transition from childhood resentment to adult empathy ? Bloomfield has many suggestions for better relationships with parents . - He says that to improve your relationship with your real-life parents , and make peace with your " inner parents " you should make a specific , and detailed list of your resentments toward each of your parents . But under no circumstances show the list to them . Instead , visualize yourself describing each resentment to your parent and being understood and comforted by him or her , even if this could never happen in real life . - When dealing with real-life parents , you need to accept them exactly as they are , paradoxically , if you want the relationship to change and improve . You may even have to accept that there are things they will never accept about you . To say , " I love you , but " is a coercive statement . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do what I say . " Instead , tell your parents " I love you and I ' d like you to do such and such , " which communicates unconditional love . - Realize that what your parent does and says will no longer have the power to control your health and happiness . Take 100 percent of the responsibility for what transpires between you . - If you take your parents ' expectations and conditions too seriously , your daily life will be filled with attempts to resist or give in to their values . You must realize that deep down you will continue loving your parents no matter what and that deep down they will continue loving you no matter what . - Know you are not obligated to ask for their opinion or tell them everything about your life . - Develop a surrogate family of friends to help fill your needs . - Learn to express anger effectively : " I care about our relationship and I feel hurt when such-and-such happens . Here ' s why and here ' s what I need so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal attacks , lecturing , trying to change your parent or dwelling on the past . Listen to your parent ' s response . - Communicate your love for your parents by becoming a good listener . Parents need to be understood , too . - Acknowledge what you like about your parents . Tell your mother or father when they ' ve said something insightful or been sensitive to your needs . - Do not confuse making peace with your parents with bending over backward to please them . Try to satisfy both their needs and your own . Bloomfield has drawn heavily on his own experiences in writing the book . A Brooklyn native , he moved to California in part to put distance between himself and his family . There were perfunctory once-a-week phone calls and visits were held to an hour or two whenever Bloomfield was in New York . " I loved my parents , but at the same time couldn ' t stand them . " The news that his father was dying of cancer of the pancreas in 1978 triggered Bloomfield ' s personal efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bloomfield hugged his father for the first time in memory . His dad resisted , and Bloomfield felt the old resentments . " But then I realized the hug was for my benefit as well as my father ' s . " Bloomfield estimated that he hugged his father 200 times over the following months before his dad initiated a hug on his own and said " I love you . " " My father ' s cancer became an opportunity for growth and change within my family . I found myself practicing the compassion and understanding I had been teaching my patients . " With Bloomfield ' s assistance , his mother and father began to work out some of the buried resentments that had accumulated between them . Bloomfield and his sister also shared their feelings more honestly than before - and also more lovingly . Bloomfield ' s father , who had always dismissed his son ' s interest in Transcendental Meditation as " weird , " enrolled in the basic TM course and began meditating , exercising and improving his diet . Bloomfield also taught his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells as taught by Dr. Carl Simonton in his book " Getting Well Again " Tarcher . Although doctors had predicted Bloomfield ' s father would die in three to six months , he survived for four high-quality years . And seeing his parents finally having a good relationship , Bloomfield said , helped him break through his own fears of marriage and settle down . Bloomfield ' s relationship with his now widowed mother has remained much improved . " My work takes me to international conferences on nutrition and health . But whenever I see my mom in New York , she ' ll look at me and say , You ' re not eating right . ' This is from a woman who lives on leftovers six days in a row ! " he exclaimed with a grin . " That used to push my button . I used to justify and defend myself . That ' s inappropriate when you ' re 38 years old . Now I see that it ' s just her way of loving me and I respond as an adult .
