PEACE By Max Apple n the Fourth of July , Jay Wilson and his partner , Leo , always threw a big party . They gave away four or five cases of pellet snakes , a gross of sparklers , paper American flags , Uncle Sam masks , just about everything that was on page five of their catalogue . But this year they were short of goods , and Leo would n't stop blaming the Koreans . " They discovered cars and electricity , " Leo told the guests , " and then they forgot about loyalty . They forgot about contracts and about people like us who taught them everything . " While Leo complained about the Orientals , Jay kept quiet and knew this would be his last Fourth of July in Florida . The Korean suppliers were making things hard , but Jay did n't blame them . Gifts and novelties were not high-profit items . Jay was the one who had gone to Seoul fresh out of Florida State and come out with 2 million charcoal pellets that turned into snakes as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sold the whole lot in the United States for seventeen cents apiece , in Canada for twenty . The snakes were the boost that made the two fraternity brothers entrepreneurs in the mail-order business . Leo liked to brag about it . " We 're not into clothes , " he 'd say . " Otherwise , L. L. Bean would be shaking in their rubber boots . " Jay knew better . He credited their modest success to timing . They went into business in 1978 , during the golden age of mail order , People were still worried about gasoline shortages and inflation . They liked to look at photos and use their new credit cards . Before Jay and Leo had a real office , while they were still undergraduates , they had an 800 number . In their senior year of college , they both made decent Max Apple 's most recent book is The Propheteers , a novel . He is at work on a collection of stories . grades and a $20,000 profit . After graduation they took their catalogue business national . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trinkets they sold , Leo thought they were all junk . Leo put his earnings into a Corvette , a condo , and a twenty-four-foot motorboat . He was clearing about $40,000 a year and thought he was Rockefeller because they had a nineteen-page catalogue and money came every day in the mail . Lately , Leo complained all the time . The Hong Kong and Taiwan suppliers were late with the improved pocket rain-bonnets and the flat Frisbees ; and as for the Koreans , J L Inc. had n't seen a charcoal snake in six months . The Koreans were n't even answering Lee 's telexes . " You ought a get your ass over to Manila or Pakistan , " Leo said , " find us some suppliers we can trust to deliver . " " Why do n't you go ? " Jay said . " You think you 're a hotshot , do n't you ? You got to rub it in , like you 're my enemy . " Leo would never leave the United States . He preferred not to leave Tallahassee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the rest of the world is not out to get me , " Leo said , " and I 'm not gon na bother them either . I 've got everything I want right here . " On the inside front cover the J &; L catalogue said : " We searched the world for bargains , " but after Jay 's trip to Korea , they searched the world by searching other catalogues and talking to other distributors . Almost every season new opportunities came their way . Most of them they ignored . Jay let Leo 's conservatism influence him . Together they decided not to distribute the Hacky Sack , and they turned down the banana purse and the inflatable greeting card . Leo was happy enough with his Corvette and his boat . He wanted his life to be like a beer commercial , only in slow motion . But Jay , now past thirty , wanted out of Tallahassee  --  and not to the Third World . He wanted to live in New York . " That would be great , " Leo said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When J &; L celebrated their tenth anniversary , Jay lit his last company sparkler . " You 're nuts , " Leo said , " you 're walking out of paradise to go live with rats . " Still , Leo was happy to mortgage his house and his boat in order to buy Jay out . He agreed to pay 5 percent of net for the next twenty years as goodwill . Unless Leo got himself another partner , Jay suspected that there would never be a next twenty years . Leo would go under selling military insignias and rubber beer-can holders . Right from the start the business had been all Jay 's . Leo was a partner because in college he had a car and could make deliveries . Jay actually had wanted to move to New York right after college , but he and Leo had those 2 million snake pellets and then there were the six-foot feather dusters and the American flags with collapsible poles every year another project to keep him in Tallahassee talking on the phone , turning the pages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not the life he wanted . Abraham Huang , in New York , understood this . For more than a year Jay and Huang had been pen pals . Jay wrote Huang a letter after reading a small item about him in Business Week . The magazine called him " Mr. Cube . " Huang did not invent the Rubik 's Cube , but he merchandised it brilliantly . He bought 3.5 million units wholesale and sat on them . Then the craze broke out . Six months later , just before the imitators came in and drove the price down to ninety-nine cents , Huang sold out . He was now a consultant in New Nbrk who charged $1,000 a day for his advice . In a letter to Mr. Cube , Jay flattered the entrepreneur 's foresight and described his own career . Huang wrote back . " Many envy well . But you are first to admire product decision . Thank you , Mr. Fan . " Jay wrote back to the millionaire , and after that , about once a month , they exchanged first-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a driver 's license or a computer . He explained to Jay that his cousin , James Huang , drove him through New York in a 1985 Dodge . " As I ride , I get ideas . Not exactly ideas , thoughts about how to act . When I sit in office , I feel stale . In car , if I am not thinking , 1 look out window  --  like seeing a movie . " When Jay wrote to tell Huang that he was thinking of cashing in his Florida business and taking the plunge in the Big Apple , Abraham Huang sent a one-word letter . " Come . " But once Jay was in New York , the consultant , though friendly and cheerful , kept his distance . He did invite him to sit in the backseat of his Dodge on a sight-seeing tour . But as they cruised through the city , Huang read the Chinese newspaper and his cousin James mentioned places in English so imperfect that Jay , after James 's first four thank yous , did n't try to respond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When James pulled up in front of Jay 's apartment building , Huang put down his newspaper . " This time West Side . Next time East Side , " he said . " Listen , " Jay said , " I really appreciate the tour . But you guys do n't have to bother . I 've got a good map and for sight-seeing I can take one of those boat tours . " " East Side very interesting , " Huang said . He then spoke Chinese to James , who quickly got out of the car to shake hands with Jay . " Make good fortune in New York , " James said . He moved his hand through the air like a jet plane . " East Side we go . " After his West Side tour , Jay stayed close to home . He made it his job to learn his neighborhood , Broadway between 110th and 125th . That much seemed manageable . Every morning after reading the Times he walked through his territory , seeing the sights and handing out quarters . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In New York everything was for sale . He bought a rug from a man who wore a gold chain bearing the letters G-O-D . Jay was trying to get away from him , but at 113th Street the salesman , running alongside to keep up with Jay 's long strides , spread the carpet over the curb . On the rug an Arabian woman emerged from a lamp . Serpents coiled around her arms . Remembering his Korean snake pellets , Jay considered the design a good omen . He paid $50 and spread the rug under his bed . This kind of direct merchandising appealed to him . The blood and bones of New York  --  the business of real estate was to Jay Wilson as re-mote as the moons of Jupiter . When he looked at a building all he saw was a place to live . For profit he liked a product , preferably something pocket-size , lightweight , and under S5 . He told Abraham Huang when they had coffee one afternoon on Canal Street that he felt camaraderie with the Indians who sold Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the younger man 's hand . " You know value , " he said . " Now we go see . " James drove them to the warehouses , first near the docks , then deep into the Lower East Side . On Rivington Street , where they looked at cartons of stretchable watchbands and ladies ' vinyl pumps , the consultant spoke openly to Jay . " This , " Huang said , pointing from the boxes they surveyed toward the Hudson River , " this is true . In big world all million dollars . Wall Street , Saks Fifth Avenue , Hotel Plaza . Here , underworld . Twenty-five cent , maybe $2.99 , maybe $3.49 . Real numbers . " Jay listened and felt like a brother . Together they stuck their fingers into drums of bottle openers and toothpaste rollers . They held up delicate paper fans and admired flower-shaped ice-cube trays , bath cushions in the shape of a woman 's lips , squeezable change purses . Abraham Huang took him to six or seven locations . They rode in dingy freight elevators and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had Jay seen such variety . Huang paused in sorrow over a crate of purple handbags . " Stale color , " he said , " impossible . " Then he reached into a bin and pulled out several ballpoint pens . " Jane 's Bar , Albuquerque , " he read , " 665-2380 . " Then , " Ted 's Texaco , Ishpeming , AAA Roadwork . " He put the pens into his pocket . " Molded plastic , " Abraham Huang said , " always good to read . " At dusk , on the third floor above a Grand Street lamp factory , Jay Wilson stopped to consider an open crate of swords . The jobber stood beside him . " This is all that 's left of Star Wars , " the man said . Jay recognized the Star Wars sword . It had been a big hit in the toy stores . He pulled out a two-foot weapon with a red handle . The sword was rounded , more a wand than a blade . He pulled it through the air to listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fear . " Eight years ago , " the jobber said , " it was $7.95 , if you could find it . At Toys " R " Us they were getting full price even after Christmas . This sword has never been discounted . It got old before its time , When the new shipments came in , the toy stores had already rolled their inventory twice and gone on to Indiana Jones . " You may think Star Wars is dead , " the jobber continued , " but eight million times a year those movies rent out . Hardly a day goes by that you do n't hear a kid charging someone with a stick and yelling that The Force is with him . And now for ten cents apiece  --  the price of the packaging  --  whoever buys this becomes the Pentagon of Star Wars . You 'll get every one there is . " The jobber kicked the crate . Jay looked at Abraham Huang . Mr. Cube smiled . Jay took the jobber 's card . The swords twinkled like silver dollars , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . At a dime a crack , he was getting a major item , about this there was no doubt . In his catalogue days he had paid more than a dime for Abraham Lincoln thimbles and candle-drip collectors . The sword was not a dimer . It was a two-foot bicolor piece and it even made a sound . Like the Hula-Hoop with a stone inside , it was something unique . Still , it was dead and might stay dead forever . Jay thought of the purple vinyl handbags , a dead item he would never touch . Then he decided that the sword was sellable , the problem was quantity . He did n't want all 600,000 . In the morning he telephoned the jobber . " No dice , " the wholesaler said . " I thought Huang told you : No split lots . For chicken feed I 'm not going to deliver twice . This one is either all or nothing . " That afternoon , to test himself , Jay called Leo . His former partner snorted into the phone . " Buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself 600,000 times . " Leo was predictable ; but Jay was n't going to make a business decision just to spite Leo . The stakes were too high . He had to think this one through . The sword would never again see $7.95 , but he could buy for a dime what might fetch a dollar , maybe two or three . Even if the worst happened , even if he could n't do a thing with them , Jay felt confident that he could drop the whole load for a quarter and walk away with 150 percent profit . The next morning he was ready to get up and make a decision . But he could n't get up , not without great pain  --  a backache riveted him to the mattress . Eventually , bent and sockless in his slippers , he hobbled to a chiropractor on 114th Street . In the doctor 's thermal Jacuzzi he began to thaw out . " Lumbar misalignment and too much tension , " the doctor said . He wrenched Jay 's spine and kept him in his office all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiropractically trained masseuse on 110th Street . The next day , able to stand and walk , but fearful that the pain would return any second  --  and still on the fence about the swords  --  Jay met Lucy Fishman . She charged $40 for thirty minutes and confirmed what the doctor told him . The problem was the gap between his fourth and fifth vertebrae . Ms. Fishman wore a white shirtwaist dress . She looked like a nurse without a cap . Her hair was long and fluffy and twice it tickled his skin as she rubbed the empty spaces in his backbone . " You should relax more , " Lucy Fishman said , " or at least sit very straight while you 're tense . " She asked him if this was an especially tense time , and he thought of the swords . " I have a chance to make a very lucrative but very risky business deal , " he said . " I 'm sure that 's what 's causing my back trouble . " Ms. Fishman stopped kneading and looked in his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . He turned over and explained about the swords . She apologized . Near the end of the massage she rubbed his ringless ring finger and asked him to call her sometime socially , if he wished . Jay did , a week later , on the morning he bought the swords . He had returned to the warehouse in the company of Abraham Huang . Once more Jay scanned the swords . Packed a thousand to a crate , there were 600 wooden boxes . He took one out of a crate and sliced the air . With Huang and James as witnesses , Jay Wilson cut his deal . He handed over a Bank of North Flor ida check for $60,000 and agreed to storage costs of $1,500 a month . " Do you like my dear he asked Abraham Huang. " 1 like , " Huang said . " Now work begins . " That night at dinner Jay handed Lucy a sword . They were at a French restaurant on Eighty-sixth Street and between them they finished two bottles of wine . Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong fingers . As she ate , she explained the lobster 's anatomy . Even though the swords were all he talked about , Jay knew that Lucy Fishman was going to be more than a date . His lumbar region was connected to his heart . " This is the biggest deal of my life , " he said , " and you are a beautiful and intelligent woman . It feels like all at once I have a business and a personal I ife . " He leaned across the table to kiss her . Later , in his bed , he massaged Lucy 's back , but her specific directions discouraged him . He asked her to roll over . Face-to-face she was more a woman , less a technician . When he told her he was falling in love , she stopped talking about the density of spinal fluid . " It 's a new life , " Jay whispered . With you and the swords I really am starting Bover. " stupidity . " " You 're not stupid , " Lucy said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine years work . My youth . " " You 're still young , " she said . " You 're just right for me . " He wanted to marry Lucy , but without money for a ring or a ceremony , he said nothing about his intentions . When he had gone through his list of brokers and factors , when the Mets and the Yankees told him they had no interest in a Sword Day , when he had run up hundreds of dollars of bills on Lucy 's phone calling Mexican and Venezuelan and even South African distributors , it suddenly occurred to Jay Wilson that he had been taken . In a fit of rage he took a subway to Chinatown and pounded on the door of Huang 's spacious loft . Mrs. Huang , frightened by the unusual man pounding on her steel door , buzzed for help . Cousin James , carrying a baseball bat , pinned Jay to the floor but relaxed when he recognized the man he 'd driven around the West Side months before . " East Side ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huang , " Jay said . " Where is he ? " James led Jay down two creaky flights of stairs to a basement room where Huang sat watching an aquarium filled with brightly colored fish . " My friend , " Huang said as he rose to greet Jay . " Friend , my ass . You set me up . You knew how much cash I had . You led me straight to those swords and set the price just at the top of my budget . Did you get the whole sixty ? " " No , " Huang said , " only half . " " You bastard . " " Not bastard . Straight business . " " You knew nobody wanted them . You offered them all over town . " " Ail over world , " Huang said . " Dime . Very cheap price . Require very big risk . " Cousin James brought in a pot of tea . " You just took my money , " Jay said . " You knew I 'd never be able to sell . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe Jay Wilson sell . This is business . " " Tea ? " Cousin James said . " Later East Side ? " " I want my money , " Jay said . " I 'm in love . I want to get married , have a family . I was stupid to risk everything on one throw . " " Yes , " Huang said , " swords stupid but love and family nice . " " I have no money . " " Most of world have no money . People marry , have children , live good . " Huang smiled , as friendly as ever . Jay Wilson , without a legal or moral leg to stand on , admitted his helplessness . " It was my own fault , " he said , " but I 'll hate you until the day I die . " " Maybe not , " Abraham Huang said . He bowed as Cousin James followed the visitor up the stairs . wo months later , with the warehouse owner threatening to throw his 600 crates into the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden table at the corner of Amsterdam and Ninety-sixth Street . Unable to sell thousands or hundreds , he was now selling single swords , every day at another location . In two months of working New York street fairs , he had earned enough to pay for one month 's storage . In two heavy canvas bags he carried ninety swords with him from fair to fair . He asked $3 apiece but often sold for less . He stopped eating lunch to save money , he looked for coins on the sidewalk , and though he had not done it yet , he started thinking about leaping over turnstiles to avoid paying subway fare . He pawned his Rolex watch , and as he suspected , Citibank offered him absolutely nothing for his 5 percent interest in the future of J &; L Inc . When he could no longer pay his rent , he moved in with Lucy . Lucy still loved him . " Forget the swords and get a job , " she said . " You 're a person like everyone else . You made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . " Jay knew she was right . He promised to forget the swords . He wanted just a month , six weeks something might turn up . He chose the Fourth of July as the end . " Promise ? " Lucy asked . Jay promised , and even in his despair , he knew how lucky he was to be teamed with this woman . Since she worked close to the Amsterdam street fair , where he 'd be today , Saturday , Lucy said she would bring him a lunch at Ninety-sixth Street . When she arrived at 12:30 , he had sold only four swords . He had taken to carrying his money , mostly singles , in a wad in his left hand . Sometimes he wished that he had done that with the $60,000 ? kept it all in his hand in singles so he could feel how much it was before he squandered it on swords . Jay held up four fingers . Lucy kissed his hand and gave him two peanut-butter sandwiches . She browsed for a few minutes , looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor , an old hippie with a curly gray beard , did a good trade in antique earrings . Jay had seen him at other fairs , recognized him by his MAKE LOVE NOT WAR tattoo . His name was Chuck  --  he had introduced himself that morning as he laid out earrings and Jay stacked swords . Lucy browsed Chuck 's table , and Jay watched the sun dip into her halter top . Her thin ribs glistened . Though he loved her . Jay Wilson , with his two bags of molded plastic swords , felt like a fool and a good-for-nothing beside her . " Do n't worry , " Lucy said . " Eat your lunch . I 'll see you at six . " To avoid embarrassing him , she did n't look back . Scanning the street , Jay saw no potential customers . The temperature was already in the eighties  --  unseasonably warm for May . The winos were in the shade ; the retirees who had been playing gin rummy folded their table . Only tired people pulling grocery carts walked past . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into the canvas bags to keep them from melting . On his scarred table the lunch bag sat alone . He considered eating one of the peanut-butter sandwiches , but , as usual , the thought of his 600,000 swords made him lose his appetite . " Tough times , huh ? " Chuck said . " I used to have $60,000 , " Jay said . " Now I 've got these . " " Hell , " Chuck said , " in ' 67 1 had a rainbow-colored van and four chicks . We had free acid and quadraphonic sound . Now I 'm a grandfather . " He pulled a picture from his nylon wallet . Jay gazed at a toddler . " Nothing freakier than a kid , is there ? " Chuck said . Moved by his neighbor 's past , Jay handed over the swords . " Give ' em to your granddaughter , " he said , " and to her friends . " " You should hang on to some , " Chuck said as he accepted both canvas bags . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the Mickey Mouse watch . " " Do n't worry , " Jay said , " I 've kept a few . " He gave Chuck his lunch too . With his table now bare Jay put the wad of bills into his pocket and began to walk down Ninety-sixth Street . " Hey , " Chuck said , " do n't give up . I know where you can get socks and blank tapes . They always use socks and tapes . " Jay waved and despite the heat began to jog uptown . Without ninety swords on his back he felt light and strong . At Ninety-ninth Street he began to run to the rhythm of a car alarm . People stared at him , wondering at his speed on such a day . At 110th Street he passed an Ethiopian parade . At 121st , though hardly panting , he paused for a line of people in red gowns with crosses emblazoned on their chests . They were the faculty and students of the Union Theological Seminary . The seminary , a castle two blocks square , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jogged in place as he watched the graduation procession . The ministers-to-be , if armed with swords , could have passed for crusaders . When the procession marched through the gates of the seminary , Jay , with nothing better to do , followed everyone into the cool auditorium and found a seat . The air-conditioning soothed him . But he felt hungry he regretted giving his lunch to the earring seller . He rose to leave and get a sandwich but the ceremony was already in progress . The graduates , quiet as ghosts , were making their way down the aisles . An usher motioned for Jay to sit . With no other choice , he stayed for graduation . He heard the coughs of the proud parents and the rustling of the ceremonial gowns . As the seminarians entered into the service of the Lord , Jay , lulled by the organ , fell into a quiet sleep . He awoke to the words of the commencement speaker . Reverend Lamberts , a tall , thin man , touched the pages of his speech as if he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awakened , heard everything . The Reverend described in detail an enormous undertaking of the church  --  the sponsorship of an International Day of Peace . It took all of Jay 's self-control to stay in his seat until the ceremony ended . When the graduates marched out , he rushed to the platform ; he needed to know the date of the international Day of Peace . kA . t the end of the year , just before Christ-STORY 61
