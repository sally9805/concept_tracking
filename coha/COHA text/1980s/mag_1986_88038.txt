One day last December , Brant Alyea was about to start work at the crap tables at the Tropicana in Atlantic City when he looked at a newspaper clipping left in his mailbox by his boss , Jim Sattazahn . The clipping was from Baseball Card News , and it listed the sons of former major leaguers now active in professional baseball . Right there in black and white was a Brant Alyea , an outfielder for Medicine Hat in the Toronto chain . " My heart went through my shirt , " says Alyea. // There are many sons of former major leaguers playing pro ball , but the saga of the Brant Alyeas , father and son , is a truly remarkable one . Garrabrant Ryerson Alyea III had not seen his son since 1968 , when he said goodbye to 15-month-old Brant Jose Alyea Medina and the boy 's mother in Managua , Nicaragua . As the years passed , the father went on a journey that took him to Minnesota and the American League playoffs , to Oakland and injury , and out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City casino . In the meantime , his son experienced an odyssey of his own  --  through an earthquake , a revolution and an escape from Managua to North America that was something out of the movie El Norte. // And now , May 12 , 1986 , Brant Alyea is about to watch his son play in a regular-season game for the first time . They are in the South Carolina crossroads of Florence , where the Blue Jays have a Class A South Atlantic League franchise . The last professional game Brant Alyea had been to took place almost 14 years ago . He does n't remember exactly when , only that it was in Oakland the first week of September in ' 72 , shortly after he was placed on the disabled list and Charlie Finley obtained Matty Alou to take his place . That afternoon he was told that his season was over and there was no need to hang around . So the next day he flew back to Rhode Island , his off-season home , and in the ensuing weeks he watched on TV as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // On this evening , Alyea is one of about four dozen people occupying the aluminum folding chairs and splintered wooden bleachers of dusty American Legion Field , down the road from the Piggly Wiggly and the 301 Drive-in ( BURGERS , FRIES , GIZZARDS , HOTDOGS ) . He had gotten off work at the Tropicana at 4 a.m. and driven 10 hours to see the Blue Jays play the Savannah Cardinals . As Florence catcher Greg David throws down to second to begin another night in the South Atlantic League , Alyea turns to his friend Nancy and says , " For nearly 14 years , just the thought of going back to a ballpark made me nauseous . I feel as if I 'm starting over . " // The 45-year-old admittedly overweight Tropicana floor person of French-Dutch descent and the skinny 19-year-old Hispanic at first base do n't seem to have much in common besides a name . But they do share a couple of things . They have both played ball in the same park in Managua , although the name has been changed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the man who shot Somoza . And somehow the son inherited the American dream of a father he never knew . To chase that dream , he risked his life to come , by way of Canada , to the United States . " I could have been a star in Nicaragua , but it 's not the same as playing in the States , " the young Alyea was saying before the game . " The real big leagues is here . Two years ago , I never thought that I could be here , getting the chance . " // His son steps into the box . " Honest to God , if you could see some tapes I have at home of me hitting , you 'd be amazed because we look so much alike , " the father says . " He 's like me in ways he does n't even know , but I believe in heredity . I made the same movements with the bat getting ready for the pitch ; I had the same stance ; I even put my hands on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know he 's sort of skinny now , but so was I at his age . He 's 6-3 , 180 now ; he 'll grow to be 6-4 , 200 or 210 pounds . I 'm more nervous watching my boy than I was when I played . " // Brant Alyea and Auda Medina spent a weekend together at the end of the Nicaraguan Winter League season in February 1966 . " When I came back for the next season that November , the boy was one week old , " says his father . " I was afraid that I was going to get into some kind of trouble . I did n't know the customs . I told them I was willing to take full responsibility . Pancho Herrera and another local player then told me not to worry , that the only way I could get in trouble was to turn my back  --  which a lot of American players had done  --  and disgrace the child and the family . I went and signed the baptismal certificate and gave him my name . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confuse the poor kid . I just signed it Brant Alyea , and I guess her family wrote in the Jose and Medina . They were so happy that I signed the papers and took away any shame that they threw a party . They were hugging me , toasting me . After Brant was born I got to know Auda better . She 'd bring the baby to my hotel and lay him down on the bed . She was a nurse , and he was always immaculate , beautifully behaved . She did a great job . // " I tried to help , but there was political trouble in January 1967 , and I had to get out before I could get my stuff . I went back the next fall on my way to Venezuela and saw them again and kept sending a little money to help out , but after ' 68 , I could n't get into the country . The earthquake hit in December 1972 and I could n't find them again . I learned later that she 'd written me , but my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pancho Herrera  --  who is Brant 's godfather  --  in 1976 . He told me he 'd seen Brant , that he was big and always playing ball . That was the last I heard . " // Two summers ago , Alyea was having a post-golf drink with his bosses , Sattazahn and Bobby Kesel . On the NBC Nightly News was a report from Nicaragua . " My boy could be one in the middle of all that , " Alyea told his friends . " I guess I 'll never know . " // Toronto scout Wayne Morgan was at the World Youth Baseball Tournament in Kindersley , Saskatchewan , in July 1984 . When he saw in the program that a Brant Alyea was playing for Nicaragua , his curiosity was naturally piqued . Then when he saw the angular 17-year-old outfielder swing the bat , he suggested that the Blue Jays follow up on him , just in case he was related to the former player and might be able to get out of Nicaragua . // Pat Gillick , Toronto 's general manager , sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the young Alyea , but Alyea was n't there , so Morgan nosed around until he found a player he thought he could trust . He gave the player an information card to take back to Alyea . " I doubted we 'd ever hear from him , " says Morgan . // Brant Jose Alyea Medina , who went by just Brant Alyea , was climbing the baseball ladder in Nicaragua . His mother and her three daughters by her subsequent marriage had left for Margarita Island , off Venezuela , in 1980 , but he stayed . " No men could leave , " he says . So he lived with his grandmother Amada and aunt Bida in Managua . " The fighting was something I learned to live with , " he says . " I was scared at times . I saw a couple of friends killed in crossfire in the street . One time I was in my house and got down on my knees to fix something on the floor . As I was down there , bullets went right over where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get involved in politics . Of course , if I had n't been a ballplayer , I 'd have had to go right into the army . Most of my friends were n't players , so they went , and a lot of them have been killed . But I always knew that my father was a ballplayer and that I 'd be a ballplayer , and ballplayers in Nicaragua get treated very well . " // Alyea played on all levels as he grew up , eventually making national junior teams that took him to Venezuela , Honduras and several other countries besides Cuba and Canada . Alyea says that he and friends talked a lot about American baseball . " Through 1980 , we got the All-Star Game and World Series on television , and we followed Nicaraguans Dennis Martinez , Albert Williams and David Green even after the government had changed . Ballplayers talked about what it would be like to go to the U.S. and play . We just did n't talk about it where we could be heard . " // Two months after the Cuban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived at Wayne Morgan 's home in California . Toronto wasted no time . Gillick put Epy Guerrero , the legendary Dominican scout who has signed players all through Latin America , on the case . // The Nicaraguan government discourages scouts from coming into the country . But Guerrero had been in Nicaragua as the trainer of the Dominican national team in 1973 , " and I knew officials who remembered me as a friend of their baseball . I told them that I was coming in to help with some clinics , and got a visa . I went in at the end of January , but I had to be careful . If they caught me , I 'd end up in jail for sure . I had a meeting and lunch at a hotel with Alyea , his grandmother and aunt , then I had to go to the house , which was about two miles away . They told me I should n't go , but I had no choice . " Guerrero 's brother-in-law , a retired Dominican general , had gotten Epy a camouflage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopped a cab for the Medina home . They agreed upon a $6,000 bonus , and Guerrero told them he would get Alyea to Canada . " No problem , " he said . // Escape would not have been possible had Alyea not politely written a thank-you note to Dennis Hyland and his family in Mantario , Saskatchewan . Alyea had stayed in their house during the 1984 tournament . That began an exchange of letters that gave Gillick and the Blue Jays their avenue to Alyea . Gillick sent the cash for the plane ticket and a bank check to the Hylands . " By then , we figured they had sent Alyea so many letters that maybe it would sneak through , " Morgan says . " We were lucky . It did . " // The check was used to pay off an official who gave Alyea the passport he had used for previous baseball trips . Guerrero arranged to get a Mexican visa for Alyea and had Hyland send it . // All that was left was to get onto a flight to Mexico City on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the airport , " Alyea remembers . " They kept asking me questions like , ' Why are you going ahead of your teammates ? ' I told them I was going to Venezuela to see my mother . Then I had to explain why my visa was only good for Mexico . I said , ' I 'm getting the Venezuela visa in Mexico from my cousin , ' and they believed me . Then there was an officer in the police who 'd coached me as a kid who was wandering around . Every time he 'd go by , I 'd put the newspaper up in front of my face . I made it . " // In Mexico City he was met by Guerrero , who hid him for two days . Alyea obtained a Canadian visa and Guerrero put him on an Air Japan flight to Tokyo that stopped in Vancouver . There , he was greeted by Blue Jays scout Ozzie Chavarria . After a night 's sleep and a couple of meals , Brant Alyea was on a flight to Calgary to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The older Alyea was n't Dale Murphy , although he had Murphy 's power . He played six seasons , hit 38 homers , knocked in 148 runs and batted .247 . In 1970 with the Twins he hit .291 with 16 homers and 61 RBIs  --  seven of which came on Opening Day  --  in 258 at bats . " I was n't a big star in the States , but I was in winter ball , " he says with a laugh . He led Nicaragua in home runs in 1965-66 and nearly broke the Venezuelan homer record in 1968-69 with 18 in 50 games . He came up with the Senators , moved on to the Twins , then got into a contract hassle with Calvin Griffith , who put him on the Portland roster . Finley drafted him from Portland in November 1971 , traded him to St. Louis the next spring , then got him back for the stretch run on Aug. 8 . Six days later , Alyea tore a groin muscle rounding first on a double off Jim Palmer . He was sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't make the team . He was through at 32. // " For three years I did n't want to talk to anybody in baseball . It was a difficult adjustment for me . " Alyea tended bar in Washington , D.C. , for a while , and in 1977 , he and his third wife moved to Hampton Falls , N.H. , where he worked for Boston Mutual Life Insurance . Eventually , that marriage fell apart . " I was n't very good at marriage , " he concedes. // Alyea wound up in Atlantic City . " I figured something had to be happening there . I was n't a big gambler , but it sounded like some fun . " He went to casino school to learn to deal blackjack and run crap games . " It was tough and sometimes embarrassing to be at school at the age of 40 with all those 20-year-olds , " he says . " I 'm not a big enough name to live off what I did in baseball . I was just another working guy . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $40,000-a-year position of floor person . // In the Tropicana casino , the 6 ' 5 " , 250-pound Alyea towers above the customers . " All I try to do is minimize any trouble , " he says . " The hours are tough lobster shifts five nights a week , but it 's O.K. " He lives in a rented duplex , and once in a great while sees former players . " Guys in the casino would get Phillies tickets and ask me if I 'd go , but I did n't want anything to do with baseball . " // When Blue Jay executive Gord Ash met the kid 's plane in Calgary , Alyea had only a duffel bag and a scrapbook . Stuck inside the scrapbook was a tattered picture of his father , selecting a bat in the Senators dugout , with manager Ted Williams in the background ( page 66 ) . // " I had hoped to get in touch with him , " says the son . " But I did n't know how to do it . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ash from Calgary to Medicine Hat was quiet . In Medicine Hat , Alyea was frightened and lonely . " It was cold . And the food ; I had diarrhea for three weeks . " Money was scarce , too , because Alyea sent most of his money to his mother in Venezuela for a down payment on a house , while the rest went to his grandmother . // " Then I started worrying about what would happen if I did n't make it in baseball . If I got released , I had nowhere to turn . I kept worrying that I 'd be sent back to Nicaragua , in which case I 'd probably end up either in jail or in the army . " His fears did not affect his hitting , for in 51 games in Medicine Hat , Alyea batted .337 . He went to the Florida Instructional League , then to Venezuela to play in a rookie league team , batting .351 . There he learned how popular his father had been . " They 'd yell , ' You ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Young Alyea was in Venezuela when his father read the clipping from Baseball Card News . The next morning the elder Alyea called the Blue Jays ' office and finally reached Ash . " They were flat to me , " Alyea says . " I asked for an address in Venezuela , and Ash said they did n't have one . I was pretty upset . " // Ash and Gillick had their reasons for the cold shoulder . Gillick says he had tried last summer to locate the father , but ran into a dead end . " All we heard was that he was in Atlantic City , and to be honest , you have to be cautious about that , " Ash maintains . " We heard he had been a recluse . We did n't know what his marriage status was . We had to be cautious for a lot of reasons . " // So Alyea waited until spring training , and in mid-March , figuring the minor leaguers would all have reported , he called the Toronto minor league complex and asked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubhouse attendant asked . // " His father . " // And so , in an awkward , halting conversation in English and Spanish , the father made contact with the son he had n't seen in more than 18 years . They exchanged telephone numbers . The next day , the father cleared it with Sattazahn and Kesel to take off the first 12 days of April . He flew to Florida on Easter Sunday and then went to the Ramada Inn Countryside in Dunedin . " He was standing there outside the door , waiting , " the elder Alyea recalls . " I guess he knew me from pictures , but , anyway , he simply said , ' Dad ? ' When I nodded , he walked up and we embraced . Now that I look back on it , I guess I 'm surprised at how natural it all seemed . He was overjoyed , and later he told me that for the first time since he arrived in North America , he felt he belonged . " // They walked into the lobby of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is my father , " the son announced , in English . For 10 days the father went to the minor league complex and watched workouts and exhibitions and intrasquad games . Ten nights in a row he took his son to dinner . // " Some kids do n't know who their father is , but I always knew , " says the son . " I always hoped I 'd find him . To be in a strange country , unable to go home again , and to know I have a place and a family to turn to . My life is completely changed . I feel very lucky . " // When young Alyea went up to South Carolina to open the season , his first road trip took him to Spartanburg . It turns out that Brant Jose Alyea Medina has more family in the U.S. than he ever dreamed possible . Garrabrant Ryerson Alyea Jr. , the father of the big leaguer , lives in the western North Carolina town of Columbus , and various cousins of his live in the area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kid in Spartanburg. // Father and son talk on the phone every weekend . " I do n't want him to worry , " says the father . " I just want him to concentrate on baseball . I 'm thrilled to be able to help . Some other things in my life did n't work out so well , so this is like a dream . I 'll be there whenever he needs me. " // There have been times this season when the kid has gotten frustrated . His team is at the bottom of the standings . Alyea is also hitting under .300 for what he says is the first time in his life , although he has seven homers and a team-high 43 RBIs . He has a quick , short stroke , and exceptional hand-eye coordination . Because the Toronto organization is loaded with outfielders , he has been moved to first base . " I know one thing , " Florence manager Hector Torres told the father . " The kid 's going to be a lot better hitter than his old man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and smiled . // " I 've had two of the biggest thrills of my life in the last couple of months , " the father is saying . " Being reunited with Brant , then hearing the P.A. announcer say , ' Brant Alyea , first base . ' It brought tears to my eyes . I 'd completely lost interest in baseball , did n't want any part of it . Now I 'm excited about his games . " // The father hopes his son can become a U.S. citizen . Brant is undecided between making his home here or in Venezuela , where his mother is , but if he decides to apply for U.S. citizenship , the Immigration and Naturalization Service might waive the five-year requirement because of his father 's sponsorship . In the meantime , young Alyea is coming to like the U.S. more and more every day . " To have my family here , that would be the best thing , " says Brant . " Here you can say and do whatever you feel . I did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most , the freedom . "
