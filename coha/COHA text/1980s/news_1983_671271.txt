The most daring thing about the effort to restore " A Star Is Born , " which has been spearheaded by the film historian Ronald Haver , is the decision to piece together several narrative passages early in the film , passages that can no longer be found in their original form , with the material that surrounds them . But these narrative snippets have a different texture from the rest of the film . They present a sequence of events that occurs just after the great star Norman Maine , played so elegantly and sympathetically by James Mason , takes an interest in the career of the young singer Esther Blodgett , played by Judy Garland in the role that has become so central to her legend. // In the shortened version , Norman tells Esther he has arranged for her to have a screen test , and she is next seen being made up at a film studio . There are nine intervening scenes ( according to Mr. Haver and to the film historian Stephen Harvey , among others who have investigated the matter ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented in the new version by a combination of dialogue , stock footage and production stills , and the effect of this material is to bring the film to a temporary halt . The still photographs , in particular , have a candid and almost melancholy feeling , in contrast to the more glamorous material that surrounds them . It ' s a measure of the film ' s enormous seductiveness that these interruptions seem so startling . A movie that cast less of a spell could tolerate this kind of intrusion far more easily. // // In view of their disruptive effect , do the added scenes really enhance the drama ? What they reveal - about Esther ' s early scrambling for employment , and about Norman Maine ' s proprietary interest in her career - is more or less implicit in the later developments of the story , particularly those moments detailing the star ' s tenderness towards his young protegee . So from a dramatic standpoint , the additions aren ' t wholly necessary . And yet , in light of the intense emotional hold that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfying. // The emphasis may shift from entertainment to scholarship during these sequences , but the entertainment has been so intoxicating that the audience is happy to have more information about these characters , even if it arrives in a somewhat stilted form . This is even more true of a later restored scene depicting Norman ' s marriage proposal to Esther , who has now become Vicki Lester , the bright young star . Of course , the audience knows that eventually these two will marry ; anyone not living under a rock for the last 19 years ( or 46 years , since the Janet Gaynor version ) even knows how that marriage will end . Yet Norman and Vicki have become such mesmerizing movie characters that any extra glimpses of them are more than welcome. // When a film is as well-loved as " A Star Is Born , " the desire to see it made whole must surely overpower any urge to edit ( unless one complains , as the exhibitors who insisted on the original changes did , that a three-hour movie can ' t bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The film always contained a section that even its director , George Cukor , wasn ' t keen on - the lavish " Born in a Trunk " number , with Vicki singing and dancing her way through the story of how she launched her career . This isn ' t much like anything else in the movie - but it **28;176; is <> a little like the " Happy Endings " sequence Liza Minnelli subsequently enacted in " New York , New York . " " Happy Endings " was one of the key elements that Martin Scorsese restored in the full-length version of his film , whereas " Born in a Trunk " was virtually disowned by Mr. Cukor . To imagine that the restoration process follows any real logic is sometimes to miss its larger point. // // That point is presumably to find as full and rewarding a version of the original work as can be assembled by reasonable means , without falling back on outtakes , storyboards or anything else not intended to be part of a finished work . It is also to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But a restoration should not hinge purely on the idea that more is better , because the case is sometimes most emphatically otherwise . Take the example of " Terminal Station , " a 91-minute film that has been expanded from 64 minutes . The short version may have not have been unexpurgated , but by some lights it was long enough. // Vittorio De Sica ' s " Terminal Station " was released in 1954 under the title " Indiscretion of an American Wife , " which conveys its essential sudsiness far better than the more authentic title did . It was deemed a " big fat failure " by Montgomery Clift , according to Mr. Clift ' s biographer Patricia Bosworth , after Mr. Clift had played the jilted lover of an American matron in Rome . She , played by a beautiful but matronly young Jennifer Jones , arrives at the railroad station with plans to break off the romance , but her lover pursues her there and attempts to change her mind . The casting of Mr. Clift as this hot-blooded Roman is explained , as best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because my mother comes from America doesn ' t make me less Italian. " // The action , confined to the railroad station , involves a series of supposedly passionate debates between the lovers , periodically interrupted by the woman ' s nephew , who is played by the young and insufferable Richard Beymer . There are also a number of Italian-speaking characters , whose presence in tiny roles does little to generate the neo-realism which was otherwise Mr. De Sica ' s trademark . Not having seen the truncated version , I don ' t know what was removed - the sequence in which Miss Jones feels twinges of guilt after buying a Sicilian peasant ' s costume for her little daughter , or the one in which she gives candy bars to some poor children , or perhaps the moment in which she confesses having thrown caution to the winds when she first let her lover buy her a cup of coffee . It ' s easier to understand why any and all of this might have been cut than to fathom why it has been reassembled. // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to the presence of Mr. Clift than to Mr. De Sica ' s handling of the material . The fact that it has been restored helps make it a curiosity , too . But as restorations grow more common , which the success of " Napoleon " in 1981 and now this full , rich " A Star In Born " should insure , the need to find audiences for them may become more of a consideration than it was in resurrecting " Terminal Station . " A film rescued and reintroduced this lovingly really ought to be a film somebody loves. // //
