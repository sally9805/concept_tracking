Some American companies follow what are called the Sullivan Principles on employment practices , which were formulated by the Rev. Leon Sullivan of Philadelphia eight years ago . The companies that do follow these principles and that reported on their activities last year say the workers they employ , 66 , 000 in a work force of around six million , will suffer if they reduce or end operations in South Africa. // They say measures taken under the Sullivan Principles - wage improvements and programs to improve black workers ' training and housing , along with the abolition of segregation in places of work - set an example to South African companies and provide a force for evolutionary change. // But those seeking divestment say the successes of the Sullivan Principles are limited because they affect only 1 percent of the labor force and do not directly attack the white authorities ' ideology of racial and tribal separation. // // The Size of the Investment // // Direct American investment in South Africa is estimated by the State Department at $2. 3 billion , down from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Race Relations for 1982 . Other estimates put overall American investment , including loans and gold stocks , at $14 billion. // Those who support divestment say black South African workers will suffer short-term disadvantage if divestment begins to hurt South Africa ' s economy seriously. // In a recent statement , the South African Foreign Ministry said American investment was " of major importance when viewed in the context of how many jobs it provides. " // The statement added , " It is not , however , of determinant political importance in a country which draws the lion ' s share of its investment capital from domestic and other foreign sources. " // Divestment , the statement said , " can not provide change at all - but it may well retard it for , as Americans well know , political progress goes hand in hand with socioeconomic advance. " // The statement challenged those advocating divestment to prove they had support here for their campaign . " Disinvestment is no esoteric political debate , " it said . " If implemented , jobs and livelihoods must necessarily be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States began a decade ago when college students pressed trustees to sell stock in companies doing business with South Africa to protest the system of racial separation called apartheid. // In the late 1970 ' s the campaign spread to smaller cities . Since 1982 Philadelphia , Washington , Boston and New York City have passed divestment ordinances that forbid investment of municipal money , such as pension funds , in South African concerns. // Five states , Connecticut , Maryland , Massachussetts , Michigan and Nebraska , also have divestment laws. // The growth of the campaign has alarmed the South African authorities enough that people publicly advocating divestment can face charges under the country ' s catchall security laws. // For Divestment // Much of the debate centers on whether black South African workers will be made to suffer with no guarantee of an eventual reward. // Some of those who support the withdrawal of American capital contend that the main impact of divestment will be on the running of the South African Government and its enormous security apparatus. // " There are two ways to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the projects director of the American Committee on Africa , a principal divestment group in New York . " One of the ways is dropping bombs on South Africa . I do not advocate that . The other is through economic pressure. " // South Africa ' s economy , Mr. Kumalo said , is highly vulnerable because it relies heavily on foreign capital and foreign technology " to perfect the apartheid system . " The divestment campaign makes " it difficult for the South African Government to raise money and technology , " he said. // Mr. Kumalo acknowledged that divestment would " hurt black people. " // " But what about white people ? " he said in a telephone interview . " Divestment will hurt both black and white people . That ' s the point I ' m making : because it will hurt everybody it will put pressure on the South African Government " to make fundamental changes . <> <> A Question of Priorities // // Mr. Kumalo said he did not like the idea of people losing jobs but asserted that the retention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system . " I feel very dead about anybody losing their job , " he said , " but the impact of the South African police and army is much more than losing a job. " // " If people have to make a choice they will agree with me : The impact of the police and military is more devastating than somebody losing a job. " // He said the Sullivan Principles did not address the fundamental issues of apartheid . " While it is good that at a Ford plant , black workers are being trained to do some jobs which they did not do before , being paid more , working conditions are improved . That ' s commendable . But when they leave the plant , they are back in South Africa where being black is a crime . " Divestment , by contrast , would lower South Africa ' s credit ratings , he said , and bring pressure on the authorities to change the system , producing long-term benefits. // Asked about the probable impact of divestment on South Africa ' s black- ruled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are supposed to stop us doing anything , it would be tantamount to saying : Let South Africa stay the way it is . " <> <> Extending Pain to Whites // // In South Africa now , he said , " there is pain and suffering being felt by the black people only . " He added , " The pain by divestment will be felt by black and white , and whites will feel it for the first time. " // Since the bulk of Afrikaners have nowhere to go outside South Africa , he said , the pressures of divestment will cause whites to accept change . " Self-interest is going to dictate to them that in the end they have to live in that country , " Mr. Kumalo said , so that a destructive response to divestment would mean that whites were " not destroying black people ' s property only , they are destroying their own property. " // The ideological range of those supporting divestment is broad . Some radicals argue privately , for instance , that the economic pressures of divestment would sharpen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate view is expressed by Bishop Desmond Tutu , general secretary of the South African Council of Churches and the winner of this year ' s Nobel Peace Prize . He says he sees Western economic pressures as the only alternative to violence and as a way to force the white authorities to negotiate changes. // Against Divestment // Opponents of the divestment campaign say it has the potential for revolutionary violence , is unlikely to be effective and could hurt the livelihoods of blacks. // Michael Spicer , director of the South African Institute of International Affairs , said : " The divestment lobby is not asking for incremental change . They are asking for change once and for all . " He said this far outstrips the white authorities ' readiness to comply. // The calculation has to take into account " the ideology , the psychology , the essence of Afrikaner nationalism , " he said in an interview , speaking of the 2. 8 million whites of Afrikaner descent whose leaders took power in 1948. // The Afrikaners saw themselves as a minority in a hostile world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From their point of view , he said , " it would be suicidal to abandon control " because a destructive conflict would ensue . Those favoring divestment might argue that a new order would then emerge , he said , " but I am not one of those who believes a Phoenix would arise from the ashes . " <> <> The Role of Capitalism // // Mr. Spicer says some people equate capitalism and apartheid and argue that only by attacking capitalism can apartheid be dismantled . " The opposite thesis is that capitalism can erode and undercut apartheid , " he said , and that an expanding economy necessarily confronts such pillars of the racial system as policies that try to limit the number of blacks in " white " areas. // Those American companies that espouse the Sullivan Principles would thus argue that their policies contribute to fundamental change. // In its most recent public assessment of its own acheivemants , the American Chamber of Commerce in South Africa , representing just over 200 American companies , said : " The influence of U.S. companies in changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " American business is evolving strategies that can make even greater progress and have an even stronger impact if its efforts are encouraged and supported in the United States . If efforts to bring about disinvestment are successful , then this influence will die away and the black people in the country will be the ones that will severely suffer from such a retrogressive step. " // Fred Ferreira , industrial relations director at the Ford Motor Corporation in Port Elizabeth , said in an interview that if his company pulled out of South Africa , its 5 , 500 workers would find no other employment in the southern coastal city while other automobile manufacturers would increase production to fill the gap . <> <> Evolution or Revolution // // " Divestment equals enhancing revolution , " he said , " because then one is creating a destabilized society . " Mr. Ferreira said that by giving black workers material benefits , their aspirations for change were nurtured and companies were " creating the circumstances for evolutionary change. " // Mr. Spicer said opponents of divestment " would say that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promises " that their political and economic lot will improve " as a result of the dislocations caused by divestment. // Additionally , he said , divestment has a regional implication since South Africa is the principal market and " economic engine " of all of southern Africa . The 1980 ' s , he said , had shown that the leaders of South Africa ' s black-ruled neighbors were " acknowledging that they have to deal with South Africa at certain levels. " // The white authorities here , he said , were " clearly articulating an intention to use these states as hostages " against external sanctions . " Southern Africa is one economic entity : you can not damage any part of it without the impact being felt in other parts , " he said. // The Outlook // An irony of the divestment debate is that blacks , the people most likely to be affected by it , have rarely been consulted . Whites , both sides acknowledge , are more cushioned from the impact of economic reverse. // Last month Prof. Lawrence Schlemmer of the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that found that 75 percent of them were against divestment . The survey was conducted by the Center for Applied Social Sciences , which Professor Schlemmer heads . He is also the president of the South African Institute of Race Relations , but it was not involved in the survey and has made no public comment on it. // Mr. Kumalo disputes the survey ' s findings but acknowledges he has no statistics to prove a contrary view . " I am saying that if the South African Government believes that the majority of the black people are for continued investment , why don ' t they allow a referendum on the issue so that people can speak without any fear. " // Those favoring divestment say they will pursue their campaign in the cities and states while seeking to promote Congressionlal moves for sanctions against South Africa . Their assumption seems to be that continued unrest in South Africa and the absence of fundamental changes in racial policies will continue to win support for their campaign. // South Africa ' s concern was reflected in an officially inspired newspaper commentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can weather a divestment siege , the battle will cause hardship. // //
