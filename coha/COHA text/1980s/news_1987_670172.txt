DALLAS  --  LTV Corp. ' s banks and the federal pension agency are pressing to remove LTV ' s huge aerospace and defense unit from the company ' s bankruptcy-law proceedings . The moves would enable the bank creditors to resume collecting interest on much of LTV ' s debt . But the proposal is likely to draw stiff resistance from the company and the committee of unsecured creditors . Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. , which insures the pension of workers at troubled companies , is LTV ' s largest creditor . Since filing under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code last July 17 , LTV has dumped some $2. 32 billion of unfunded pension liabilities on the agency , giving the agency a deficit of more than $4 billion . The banks have a $175 million unsecured term loan and a $50 million secured revolving credit line with the aerospace and defense unit . On Monday , U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland will decide whether parties other than LTV can file reorganization plans for the company . Up to this point , LTV has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than once in having that advantage extended . The agency plans to ask the court to permit other parties to file a plan for the aerospace unit immediately ; the banks , however , are willing to give LTV two more months to come up with its own plan for the aerospace unit . " Aerospace and defense can be reorganized more easily and quickly than steel or energy and ( we ) see no reason to delay the reorganization , " said Royal Dellinger , the agency ' s deputy executive director . But an LTV spokesman said , " We continue to believe that the aerospace unit should be a part of the consolidated plan of reorganization . " He added that the company hadn ' t been notified of any opposition and still plans to seek court approval to extend for 120 days its exclusive right to file for all subsidiaries . The current deadline is Monday . Judge Lifland is widely expected to grant LTV at least some extension on its filing rights . " But it ' s time the company started thinking about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Dellinger said . " They ' ve had a year and they haven ' t made any significant progress " in formulating a reorganization plan . Whether LTV would be able to keep the unit in the bankruptcy-law proceeding or prevent its forced sale has been a key issue since LTV made its massive filing . The unit , which Raymond A. Hay , the chairman and chief executive officer , calls " the crown jewel , " is LTV ' s only consistently profitable business , and has been operating virtually free of bankruptcy-court constraints since shortly after the filing . The court has allowed the unit " to operate in the normal and regular manner of business " on both its pending contracts and on any new contracts it gets while under bankruptcy-law protection . Under Chapter 11 , a company is protected from creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay its debts . If the groups succeed in their effort , it would significantly boost the chances that creditors would push for the unit to be sold or spun off . LTV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any creditor move to either reorganize the unit separately or force its sale . Creditors , on the other hand , have discussed the idea almost since the day of LTV ' s filing . And the pension agency , the banks , and the committee representing unsecured creditors have recently been holding serious discussions on the issue . But the moves by the banks and the pension agency caught the unsecured creditors by surprise . " Absent any agreement , the unsecured creditors will absolutely oppose any attempt to bring any component out of this bankruptcy early , " said Larry Galie , the committee ' s chairman . " We ' ll litigate this into the next decade . " It ' s understood that the unsecured creditors might in fact be amenable to an early reorganization for the unit  --  or even a sale  --  but that they hadn ' t yet decided whether it would be in their best interests . To go along with an early reorganization , however , they also would likely press for the agency to reduce its more than $2 billion claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would still be willing to negotiate with the unsecured creditors , but that it wants to take a look first at how much of its claim the aerospace and defense unit might be able to satisfy . Under federal law , the pension agency , unlike the other creditors in the LTV bankruptcy-law proceeding , can look to any LTV unit for payment of its full claim ; theoretically , the agency could be paid in full from the aerospace and defense unit alone . But a steel creditor , for example , can by law only have its claim satisfied by the steel unit , unless negotiations provide otherwise .
