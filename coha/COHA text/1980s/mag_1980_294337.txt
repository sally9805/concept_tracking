While some families poked around in dresser drawers and jewelry cases for gold cufflinks and earrings , others rummaged through attics and closets in search of long forgotten sterling silver tea sets , candlesticks , or perhaps just a stray silver ashtray . Gold and silver fever is spreading to ordinary folks , and many were lining up at coin and jewelry shops to seE their little treasures for quick cash . <P> With bulging pockets , shoeboxes , shopping bags and even pillow cases , a throng of students , housewives , executives and pensioners last week crowded into the waiting room of the Empire Diamond &; Gold Buying Service on the 66th floor of the Empire State Building . Outside Jonathons Coin in Los Angeles , 250 people waited in line . Noted Vice President Richard Schwary : " With gold selling for about $600 an ounce , an old watchband is worth a lot . We have really got a panic here . The stampede is on . A decent sterling silver tableware set will go for $3,000 to $5,000 . I gave my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of newlyweds sold off their incomplete sterling silver dinner service because they did not want to pay the high price to buy the missing pieces . In New York a schoolgirl sold her father 's old gold bridgework to help pay her way through college ; an elderly widow sold her gold jewelry piece by piece ; and one woman recently traded in her gold I.U.D . In Los Angeles Dealer Schwary reported buying everything from a three-foot-high silver trophy awarded in a 1930s auto race to Vietnamese taels , ultrathin gold pieces the size of calling cards . <P> At New York 's Empire Buying Service , Owner Jack Brod was importuned by one eager customer to extract his loose , gold-filled tooth on the pot . Brod refused ; the man left , but returned a few days later with tooth in hand . Typically , New York Dealer Harry Rodman paid one Maryland dentist $500 for the gold scrap and dust that he had collected with a special vacuum from dental grindings in just two years of practice . Dealers also quietly bought gold fillings from morticians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Some disappointed sellers discovered that their " pure " gold bracelets were really cheap plate . Even if the pieces were in fact gold or silver , many sellers were unhappy to learn that they get considerably less than the much headlined prices of the metals . Sterling silver is only 92.5% pure , while 10- , 14-and 18-karat gold is respectively 42% , 58% and 75% pure . Also , dealers can take commissions of 10% or more on trades . <P> Yet , the pieces keep rolling in and , in the back rooms of trading shops around the country , shining heaps of gold and silver bracelets , school rings , wedding bands and chains wait to be sorted . Cardboard boxes over-flow with gold cigarette cases and compacts ; walls of shelves are full of antique silver candlesticks and saltcellars : pails are awash in silver quarters and dimes . In one room in the Empire Trading Service , 30 coffee cans sit filled to the brim with gold teeth , crowns and inlays.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
