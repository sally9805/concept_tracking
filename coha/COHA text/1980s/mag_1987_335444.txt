In spite of the uproar he created by landing his Cessna Skyhawk 172 on the edge of Moscow 's Red Square two weeks ago , there were signs that the Soviets might deal leniently with Mathias Rust , 19 , the newly famous West German aviator . No less an insider than Valentin Falin , head of the official Novosti press agency , initially predicted that the " young man will soon see his parents and friends . " But as the week wore on , the Soviets seemed to grow less and less inclined to let Rust off the hook , or for that matter to dismiss his unprecedented feat as an innocent , if dangerous , stunt . In any case , said Yegor Yakovlev , editor in chief of the foreign-language weekly Moscow News , Rust " will have to answer according to the law .

A career soldier with combat experience in World War II , Yazov is believed to have made a favorable impression on Gorbachev during the Soviet leader 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based as commander of the U.S.S.R. 's far eastern military district . Yazov was summoned to Moscow last February and given the Defense Ministry 's top personnel job . That is not a traditional launching pad to the top , but its occupant has a major role in high-level promotions and transfers , and thus plays a critical part in Gorbachev 's campaign of perestroika , or economic restructuring , which has become the Soviet leader 's rallying cry for all sectors of society .
