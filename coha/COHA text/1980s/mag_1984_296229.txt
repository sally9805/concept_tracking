They 're No. 2s-and they 're trying hard No one much cared what William Miller said about Hubert Humphrey in 1964 , or what charges Sargent Shriver leveled against Spiro Agnew in 1972 . The truth is , no one has much cared what any vice-presidential candidate said or did-until this year . By selecting a woman , the Democrats made the 1984 contest for Vice President more intriguing than it has ever been . Indeed , the sideshow is regularly getting as much focus as the main event , partly because the electoral outcome seems predictable . <P> Then there is the forward spin : both Geraldine Ferraro and George Bush plausibly have designs on other offices-Ferraro a Senate seat from New York in 1986 , Bush the presidency in 1988 . The political future of each may be affected more by public impressions made during the campaign than by the vote tally on Nov. 6 . <P> Those impressions stand to be fixed powerfully in voters ' minds this week : the vice-presidential candidates meet for their single 90-min. debate on Thursday in Philadelphia . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning in the field , Bush on paper . The Democrat has drawn large , enthusiastic crowds . Her quick-footedness has served her well . Bush , meanwhile , is surprisingly inept as a campaigner . His earnest speeches seldom excite even the smallish Republican crowds he usually addresses , and he sometimes reacts badly to the to-and-fro of daily campaigning . Yet according to public opinion polls , the Vice President , with his 18 years of solid national experience , is much more highly regarded than his Democratic counterpart . A New York Times/CBS News poll released Sunday found that 47% of voters view him favorably , compared with 35% who feel that way about Ferraro . <P> Ferraro delivered a typical , spunky performance when she visited the down-and-out steel city of Youngstown , Ohio . <P> " Lost your job ? " she asked at a rally . <P> " If so , the Administration tells you to vote with your feet . Hungry ? The Administration says to have some cheese ... " <P> But no political automaton she : Ferraro stopped , swiveled her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ft. away . " I see a sign over there saying ' Gerry-we need jobs , not cheese . ' " The crowd applauded the personal touch and mobbed her when she finished . Says Campaign Manager John Sasso : " The crowd left more excited than when they arrived . " <P> She does have a knack , like Reagan , for coming across as both larger than life and down-to-earth-a friendly star . Her press secretary , Francis O'Brien , is also a Hollywood producer . " There 's no formula for stardom , " says O'Brien of his candidate 's appeal . " But it starts when she looks at an audience , whether one person or 10,000 , and actually sees them , engages them . " Ferraro 's confidence got a boost in late August , after her performance at a marathon press conference concerning her finances . " When she saw how bowled over everyone was , " says an aide , " well , she 's been running free ever since . That convinced her that the public and press would buy her exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
