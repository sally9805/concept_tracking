 | T his thing 's going to crash ! " The realization hit as I lean hard on the control stick . " Come on , pick up , " I plead , frantically willing the aircraft 's nose to point upward . But it 's to no avail : The landscape just keeps wheeling wildly by at an ever-quickening pace . No matter what I try , the Eagle wo n't come out of its slow , seemingly inexorable spiral toward the ground . Sweat beads on my brow when I pedal harder in a futile attempt to increase airspeed and precious lift . The earth 's surface is now rushing toward me at an alarming rate . " It 's over , " I tell myself . The ground looms up at a crazy angle when the color video-screen image freezes mid-frame . " Nice try , " Daedalus project leader John Langford tells me , patting my shoulder from behind the recumbent bicycle seat . Almost everybody does that the first time ; you had it up a short time , at least . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? into one of those downward spirals , it 's tough to get out , " he says soothingly . Still breathing hard , I pull my feet from the bicycle pedals and try to conceal my embarrassment from project aerodynamicist Mark Drela , test pilot/human factors expert Steve Bussolari , and other Daedalus team members who have witnessed my simulated flight . " You really have to be very far in front of this airplane when maneuvering , but @#  | you ca n't overcompensate or you 'll lose it , " Bryan Sullivan , the project 's simulation and flight control engineer , advises . Sullivan resets the flight simulator ? a welded framework with seat , pedals , sprocket , and bicycle chain linked to an automobile alternator , two control sticks , and a Silicon Graphics IRIS 2400 computer graphics work station ? for another run . But I decline , having already received a graphic lesson on the Michelob Light Eagle 's slow roll and yaw response . Over toward the center of the whitewashed , arc lamp-lit airplane hanger at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real Eagle rests its graceful , transparent , DC9-sized wings up on chocks . By the time you read this , the newly built research prototype airplane will have been trucked out to a dry lake bed at NASAs Dryden Flight Facility in California for flight tests . After that , the frail machine will attempt to beat the world 's distance record for human-powered aircraft ( HPAs ) set by the Gossamer Albatross , which crossed the 22-mile-wide English Channel PS , Dec. ' 78 . If the tests are successful , a second , more highly refined airplane ? Daedalus ? will be built to try the 69-mile flight from Crete to mainland Greece , a 72 1 POPULAR SCIENCE  | re-creation of the mythical Greek craftsman 's flight from captivity on wings fashioned from wax , thread , and feathers . The feat , planned for fall of this year or spring of the next , would more than triple the record for HPAs set by Bryan Allen in Paul MacCready 's Albatross . The flight seems possible , but only by pushing human endurance and flight technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed for determining how best to do it . " We 're right on the verge of feasibility , " Drela says . Success will depend on a severely optimized aircraft designed with the help of computers , built from advanced materials , and equipped with an autopilot and a finely tuned athlete to power and pilot it . " I guess you can see why we built the training simulator , " Bussolari remarks . " Since there are no two-seat HPAs , your first flight in the Eagle is a solo flight . With a plane that took almost 15,000 person-hours to build and that 's this difficult to fly , we do n't want to take any chances . " Lois McCallin , a lean , 122-pound tri-athlete who beat out 25 candidates to become the project 's first official pilot , agrees . " The simulator is really very helpful ... it 's the closest thing to actually flying the Eagle . It 's also a big confidence builder . " Later , we 're upstairs in the Daedalus project office , a gray , low-ceilinged room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV monitor . They stare intently at a videotape of the early morning 's flight test . Somehow , it looks a lot like a football team watching Sunday game films . Bussolari questions McCallin like a coach debriefing his star rookie quarterback about a big play , while two technicians lounge in a corner commiserating about the allnighters they 'd pulled last night to repair the rudder . Two days previously , the fragile plastic foam ribs of the rudder had been damaged when a gust of wind blew the freeswinging rudder assembly into the boom as the ground crew carried the Eagle into the hanger . POPULAR SCIENCE photographer Greg Sharko and I are still smarting from our 4 a.m. wake-up call , though it does n't seem to have fazed anyone else . Their energy is impressive . It 's clear that this project and the airplane downstairs is the offspring  | of a close-knit , inspired group of 20 determined individuals , many of whom are former model-airplane enthusiasts . They 're people who are willing to work long hours for months to attain a goal that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it for the challenge . The Eagle 's record attempt ? the result of years of planning and scrounging around for money and equipment , and months of laborious handwork ? is the first peak . The Aegean flight is the Everest still to come . Drela tells me how it all began . What 's next ? " The entire project came up almost as a joke , " Drela explains . " John Langford and I had just finished giving a talk to the local chapter of the AIAA American Institute of Aeronautics &; Astronautics about Monarch , the HPA we 'd built that won the Kremer Speed Prize in 1984 . During the question-and-answer period somebody asked , What 's next for humanpowered flight ? ' Just as an off-the-cuff suggestion , we started talking about redoing Daedalus 's mythical flight from Crete to the Greek mainland . " Langford continues : " The next thing we knew , people were talking about raising money for the project . I remember asking myself , What am I letting myself in for ? But by then , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He goes on to explain how hundreds of thousands of dollars in money , time , and equipment had been solicited from organizations such as the Smithsonian Institution 's National Air and Space Museum , Anheuser-Busch Co. , MIT , Charles Stark Draper Laboratory , Fidelity Investment Co. , and many other corporate sponsors . The new sky cycle flies at 15 miles an hour , slow for conventional aircraft but 50 percent faster than other longdistance HPAs . The relatively highspeed design is required to fly from Crete to mainland Greece in less than five hours ? the longest posited duration of still-air ( 4- to 5- mph wind ) conditions . " The speed constraint , " Drela says , " is necessitated by meteorological concerns . We 're forced to go in a certain window . . . somewhat faster than we would have liked to . " When we were doing the other HPAs , we pretty much knew that our goals were attainable , " Drela says . " The flight from Crete to the mainland is not necessarily doable . We 're dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limits of feasibility . The human engine is underpowered for this application , so you need uncompromised aerodynamic and powertransmission efficiency . " " The fundamental challenge of the project is to keep the aircraft aloft solely through the power provided by the muscles of the human pilot Bussolari explains . " In the early design phase , the engineers were asking us : How much power can a human pilot produce ? Literature studies and extensive ergometer stress tests on Lois and other volunteers led us to a power-toweight ratio of about three watts per kilogram of pilot body weight . We realized immediately that we 'd need elite endurance-trained athletes , since the power output for the Aegean flight will be grueling ? roughly equivalent to two marathon runs back to back . For four or five hours , the pilot has to produce close to one-third of a horsepower ? that 's like riding a bike on level ground at twenty-three miles per hour . " The MIT engineers spent months honing their design to minimize weight and drag . Each major systemstructure , aerodynamics , electronics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was contested . Unlike earlier HPAs such as the Albatross , which was festooned with bracing wires , the Eagle has only one support wire . Wires are lightweight and strong , but they exact a heavy drag penalty . Because the Eagle has only one bracing wire , the almost cantilevered wings must be far stronger and stiffer than those of previous HPAs . Strong , stiff wings Making strong , stiff wings is relatively easy , but making strong wings lightweight is difficult . Says Juan Cruz , senior engineer for structure : " We knew we were going to use high-modulus Thornel carbon fibers from Amoco Performance Products , which provide very good stiffness and good strength . But when we started looking at the design for the wing spar , the primary load-bearing member , we saw that we were dealing with two forces : torsion and buckling forces . We playedaround with many different spar designs . Finally , we bonded together three circular tubes , one on top of the other , which would allow us to decouple the two forces and deal with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dull-black material and hands it to me . The wing-spar sample is strangely lightweight for its size . " The big , thin-walled tube in the center will handle the torsional forces trying to twist the wing , while the small , thick-walled tubes above and below will control the buckling forces trying to break it , " he says . Cruz and other team members spent weeks painstakingly laying up the carbon-fiber-fabric plies at the correct angular orientations around rodlike mandrels and then curing the lengthy tapering sections in ovens . After that came the meticulous process of bonding the tubes . The resulting threefold tube breaks down into five segments . Cruz and Steve Finberg , senior engineer for electronics , walk me past a light transport plane with its metal wings and turboprop engines , and across the expansive hanger floor into a side workroom . There , an odd-looking apparatus sits next to an IBM PC-XT and a tray of breadboard electronics . The device has two big turnscrews and two posts arrayed vertically on a rectangular base with fixtures on two horizontal turnscrews riding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box that contains a lump of lightblue plastic foam . " This is our numerically controlled foam cutter . It took us a month to build , " Finberg notes . " This baby cuts out these ribs to a high dimensional tolerance and saves a lot of time , " Finberg says , brandishing two airfoil-shaped panels of blue two-pound Styrofoam plastic . More than 120 of those ? - inch slices of foam , wrapped with wood veneer and Mylar plastic tape , are used on the Eagle . " The PC thinks this apparatus is a printer . It down-loads files containing three-dimensional coordinates to motors , which move the electrically heated wire via the turnscrews , " Finberg explains . Cruz peers sourly at the flimsylooking ribs and says , " Just as we did for the spar , we looked at many rib designs . Here , you 're also trying to balance many structural and aerodynamic concerns , so there are compromises . " He cracks a grin . " The one thing you learn is the perfect rib is a truly mythical creature . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He ran a cornputer program on VAX mini-computers that simulates the airflow over wingsa numerical wind tunnel ? to design a wing shape that would do the job . " I wrote the code for the simulation program for my doctoral studies , " Drela sayss , as he , Langford , and I survey the 50-foot length of wing hanging just above our heads . The spar and the polystyrene foam ribs are plainly visible through the thin , transparent Mylar skin . " Wing design is an exercise in trade-offs ; the program allows you to vary the parameters as you 'd like . High lift , low drag " The basic point of a wing is to generate in lift the gross weight of your airframe with the minimum amount of drag , " Drela continues , critically eyeing the wing . " Low drag at this lowspeed regime entails a large span and a slender planform . This gives you a long-range , high-efficiency wing . " The wing 's airfoil profile or crosssectional shape is another bundle of trade-offs , Drela explains . " Construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing has got to be easy to build . " Surface quality is crucial to drag from air friction , " he says . He points to the sheet of white polystyrene foam covering the leading edge of the wing . " The pebbled texture of the one-pound foam headboard ' which blocks out the desired airfoil shape for the flexible skin shows through the Mylar plastic film and is affecting the airflow . We may have to sand it down . You can see the same type of thing happening when dew or frost forms on the wing . Performance really deteriorates . " Airflow separation " You 're trying to tailor the pressure distribution on the wing to get the maximum pressure differential between the upper and lower surfaces , which creates lift , without causing the airflow to separate into drag-producing turbulence , " explains Langford . Through careful shaping , he says , the designer tries to delay the flow separation so the wing slips through the air as cleanly as possible . " Think of a cigarette smoke plume , " Langford says . " First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow . Then it starts meandering and moving more slowly ; that 's turbulent flow . Finally , the smoke breaks off into spinning vortices that move very slowly ; that 's separated flow . " The taper in the wing , says Drela , means that three different airfoil shapes , " each with its upper surface tweaked to compensate for decreasing chord or width , " are used . " The taper gives a constant downwash along the span , which minimizes losses from induced drag I the horizontal component of the lifting force developed by the wing , " Langford notes . The result of all this fine-tuning is a wing with 30 percent less drag than the Albatross 's wing . Improving the Eagle 's response time in maneuvers is not easy , Langford adds . " In a conventional airplane , the mass of the air that must be displaced when the plane moves is negligible . But in a lightweight airplane with a one-hundred-foot wingspan , the mass of that air is significant . This is why the Eagle is so slow to accelerate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . " The tail surfaces , " are designed to be non-load-bearing and low drag , " Drela says , gesturing to the stern . " People frequently ask me why they 're so small . It turns out that you do n't need much control surface area because it takes less force to turn an airframe that has all its mass concentrated in the cockpit . " Langford describes the propeller as " almost an elongated pear shape with a twist . It has a wide chord that 's thinned out at the end . " The same principles used for designing the wings hold for the prop , he comments . " We 've added variable-pitch capability to the prop set by a lever in the cockpit to allow the pilot to vary the pedal resistance as needed , " Drela says . Instead of using bicycle chains to transmit power ? standard equipment on earlier HPAs because of their simplicity and light weight ? the MIT engineers decided to use a gearbox/ torsion shaft arrangement designed and built by Bob Parks , a veteran of a previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Space Co . Though the two sets of aircraftquality spiral bevel gears ( donated by Arrow Gear Co. ) require higher tolerances and are more difficult to build , they transmit power more efficiently , and power transmission efficiency really pays off in lift , the engineers say . One four-pound gear set with a 1:1.5 ratio is installed at the pedals , and another set with a ratio of 1:1 is embedded in the boom . The prop turns oneand-a-half times the pedal speed . " The main wheel behind the seat is heavy-duty nylon , " Drela says . " We 'll use a light molded-plastic wheel for the runs in California . " He adds that the wheel has about 1 ' /2 inches of travel on an elastomeric spring ? otherwise known as a rubber stopper . The front wheel is just as sophisticated : It 's a hockey puck with a hole , fixed to a caster . The Eagle has a sophisticated sensor system linked to an autopilot that 's designed to reduce pilot workload on long-duration flights . An airspeed indicator is'required , Finberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to judge speed inside the cockpit . He points to a small wooden pinwheel mounted on the boom . Small magnets are mounted a  | quarter of an inch off the axis , he says . When the pinwheel spins , magnetic pulses are generated , which drive a simple tachometer circuit that feeds signals to the instrument panel . " When you 're over water , featureless terrain , or flying at night , it 's easy to lose track of altitude , so you need an altitude sensor , " Finberg says . " We have a sound-pulse range finder , a Polaroid SX-70 Radar Ranger . The altitude is proportional to the time of return of the emitted signal . " A pilot normally gets attitude information from the horizon , " Finberg continues . " But at night or in fog that becomes a problem , so you need roll/pitch sensors . We have two options open for roll/pitch sensors : electrostatic sensors that measure the electrostatic field between the ionosphere and the earth , and solid-state quartz rate gyros . The electrostatic sensors measure the differential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field and comparing the readings . The wing tips are at equal height when the local fields are equal . The tail-boom sensor compares its output with an average of the wing-sensor readings to develop pitch attitude . The devices themselves are amplifiers coupled to plates of metal to which an alpha-particle emitter ? a polonium element ? has been attached . The emitter ionizes the air , allowing the field measurement " For a directional-heading indicator , the Eagle will have a solid-state fluxgate compass , Finberg says . The system registers deviation from original heading . All sensor signals will be routed to the instrument display , he says . The lightweight low-power plastic liquidcrystal display from Polaroid Co. will be back-illuminated with a Luminescent Systems electroluminescent panel . Roll and pitch information will be displayed on moving bar graphs , while airspeed and altitude will appear on digital readouts . Batteries are another concern . Weight and reliability are important , he says . " We chose Duracell lithium six-volt batteries , " Finberg says . " There 's one in the fuselage , and two others in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the devices they power to minimize losses . " " The autopilot is designed to hold the system in a steady-state condition , " Sullivan explains . " It has three modes : an airspeed hold , basically a cruise control ; a heading hold , which works off the flux-gate compass ; and a roll attitude control , or wing leveler . The airspeed hold is there because the wings are designed to be more efficient at a certain speed , so the better you hold that speed , the more efficient your flight will be . If the pilot puts too much power in , the elevator causes the plane to gain altitude . " The airspeedhold system is based on a summing function of the airspeed indicator readings and the data from the pitch-rate electrostatic sensor . The system sends out a pulse train over a fiber optic cable to a model airplane servomotor located in the elevator . The motor is connected to the trim tab , a small , angled flap on the trailing edge , which " flies " or deflects the elevator surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wing leveler is driven by the roll-rate electrostatic sensor and works through changes in the wing-tip attitude . The heading hold , he says , works off a summing function of the compass information and data from the roll-rate electrostatics . It has a similar actuation link to the rudder . Designing for exhaustion " Since the Eagle weighs only eightyeight pounds , " Bussolari tells us over breakfast , " most people in good physical shape could fly it . The question is , For how long ? It 's going to be a real mental challenge to overcome the fatigue . The pilot 's movements become coarse . That 's one of the reasons why we 're building the autopilot . It allows the pilot to let go of the controls to take a drink , for example . " Cooling and dehydration will also be a problem . Langford says that " pedaling inside the fuselage is like being inside a closed Baggie with a hair dryer on . " Bussolari adds : " We figure that the pilot 's body temperature will go up one degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It looks like water consumption will be about one liter of water per hour . You 're talking four or five kilograms of water for the flight ; that 's ten percent of Lois 's McCallinl body weight . " We 'll have to put in some air vents , of course , " Bussolari continues . " But you pay for cooling vents with increased drag . " One idea is to place a block of ice in the cabin and to direct air through a vent over it to cool the incoming air . As the ice melts , the pilot can drink it . " In fact , a vent might help our power situation , " Bussolari says with a smile . " Our faculty advisor , Dean Jack Kerrebrock , says that if it 's done correctly , there should actually be a benefit from a vent . He says that we could set up a human-powered ramjet ' in the fuselage . The incoming air , rammed in at fifteen miles per hour , would be heated by the pilot 's body and then expand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe a fraction of a gram of thrust . "
