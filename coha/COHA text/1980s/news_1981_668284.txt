Does it say something about the middleweight division when Marvin Hagler may be reduced to fighting an opponent who made his name wrestling a bear ? This is no John Irving story . Juan Domingo Roldan is an Argentine middleweight , whose record is 35-2 , and who was ranked eighth in the Latin American Ratings by the Latin American Boxing Assn. as of June 30 . Roldan , 24 , rose to fame at the age of 15 by completing a round with a bear in a Hungarian circus . According to a story relayed by Steve Kinzer , TheGlobe ' s Latin American correspondent , Roldan won 40,000 pesos for lasting the round . The bear , which weighed 260 kilograms , could not handle Roldan ' s speed . Now Hagler may be asked to do what the bear could not . Roldan is on the list of potential opponents for Hagler while Hagler waits for Ray Leonard to decide when , where and how much . A promoter in Buenos Aires , Juan Carlos Lectoure , told the newspaper La Prensa that Roldan will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight with Roldan in South Africa may be the most lucrative fight available for Hagler , because the South Africans pay big money to bring in foreign champions for propoganda puroposes . They use the media spotlight to tell the world that their quasi-slave society is badly misunderstood . Hagler may find himself fighting an Argentine bear-wrestler in South Africa because the middleweight division is so weak it offers no alternative . With Mustafa Hamsho , Vito Antuofermo , Alan Minter and Fulgencio Obelmejias no longer factors , the remnants include : Dwight Davison , a 6-1 , 26-year-old from Detroit , who fights a dull , cautious , stand-up style . His biggest wins are 10-round decisions over Curtis Parker and Wilford Scypion , his only loss is a 10-round decision to Robbie Epps earlier this year . Davison is one of the rare Detroit fighters not in Emanuel Steward ' s Kronk stable , and a feud with Steward forced Davison to go out of Detroit to fight . The fact that Davison is managed by Carl King and promoted by Don King works against his chances of fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Animal ) Fletcher , a 5-7 , 27-year-old from Philadelphia , is perhaps the one middleweight who could beat Hagler . A rags-to-riches story , Fletcher won the ESPN tournament last year after being entered as a late replacement . Lack of guidance and brushes with the law marred his early years as a fighter . Fletcher scored an impressive 10-round decision over Norberto Sabater in June , but was hospitalized after a brutal split decision victory over Ernie Singletary in September . He throws punches from all directions in a pressuring , fast-paced attack . But his total of 16 pro fights ( 13-2-1 ) leaves him woefully inexperienced . A Hagler- Fletcher bout in the Spectrum would be a certain sellout . Wilford Scypion , a 5-11 , 23-year-old from Port Arthur , Texas , was initially known as the guy who killed Willie Classen with a brutal right in their Nov. 23 , 1979 bout . He lost to Hamsho in June , 1980 , when Hamsho shoved him through the ropes in the final round .

Robbie Epps , a 6-2 , 23-year-old from Greenville , S.C. , is fighting out of Clovis , New Mexico . Epps ' 30-1 record includes the win over Davison . He had 110 amateur fights and uses his reach to box rather than swarm opponents . Tony Sibson , a 23-year-old from Leicester , England , has a recent win over Minter . His 40-3 record includes 23 knockouts . A Detroit promoter is trying to make a Hagler-Sibson bout at the Silverdome for Super Bowl week. - Joe Frazier has chosen Oklahoma heavyweight Monte Masters as his first comeback opponent . The bout is supposed to take place after Nov. 15 at either Oklahoma City or Atlantic City , 5 1/2 years after Frazier ' s last fight , a KO loss to George Foreman . . . The jokes about Quick Tillis are deserved ( How do you knock out Tillis ? Step on his feet ) but his performance against Mike Weaver was not all bad . Tillis had never gone 15 rounds , and he proved something about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounds , he took some big body punches and returned some stiff punches that backed Weaver up . Considering that Tillis has had only 21 pro bouts , and that Weaver was his first top-flight opponent , his chances look as good as Greg Page ' s and Mike Doke ' s . . . John Tate ' s comeback continues Thursday night against Barry Funches , in an ESPN bout from the Sands in Las Vegas . . . The Hagler people say they will absolutely not fight Leonard at 154 pounds . But Hagler ' s weight of 157 in Chicago , his lightest in 18 months , has convinced some people that he is willing to comprimise somewhere between 154 and 160 . . .
