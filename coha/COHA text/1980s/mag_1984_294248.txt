Or , a crash course in chic merchandising madness <P> Sure , the clothes are beautiful . But there are problems . There are questions . <P> Will customers understand the Ferr lapel that eases down to the waist and folds over like a scarf ? How about that Comme des Garons dress-is that the armhole or the neckband , and where does all that damned draping go ? Do clients want to be elegant and easy with Armani , gilded with Lagerfeld , transported by Miyake to some astral plane where clothes , craft and fine art all cozy up ? Do they want to stay with the hard , somber shades of the past few seasons or break loose with the Day-Glo flash of fresh fluorescence ? Do they want the newly refined chic of Montana , played down and spiffed up like cotillion costumes for postpunk debs ? Or the electric , eclectic , aggressively youthful chic of Jean-Paul Gaultier ? Or the Olympian chic of Saint Laurent ? And-oh , yes . Is Fort Worth really ready for Versace ? <P> The most prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to all those other questions their buyers would probably like to have one collective answer . It would be much the same answer that Bloomingdale 's or Saks Fifth Avenue or Bergdorf Goodman might give to anyone who asks , and it is an answer that has very little to do with a store 's size . Small , sharp , selective boutiques all over the country , from Maxfield in Los Angeles to Alan Bilzerian in Boston , would reply the same way as the behemoth down the block : the customers should want it all . <P> <P> After a fine frenzy of activity that began in mid-March with designers ' fashion shows in Milan and ended 14 days later in Paris , the order books for autumn were finally closed barely two weeks ago . The big boys and the boutiques shoved their way into the same shows and held down desk space in the same sales offices , as they all dropped a bundle and bought the line . Then they all went home to endure the inevitable surprises when the shipments arrive several months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Neiman-Marcus Senior Vice President Marilyn <P> Kaplan , " who does n't look at the apparel , see something and say , ' Did 7 buy that ? I must have been drunk . ' " <P> To minimize such shocks of the new , the refreshment menu at most design sales offices goes easy on the alcohol . Nevertheless , the whole buying process remains a heady , intriguing , enervating and slightly intoxicating business . It can get all tangled up between low math , high fashion and rude stereotyping that becomes a way to identify-indeed , codify-the store 's clientele . Bloomingdale 's , launching a new addition in southwest Miami this August , is keeping its collective eye on the demographics . " We realize there is a very large Spanish-speaking population , from either Cuba or South American countries , " says Bloomingdale 's Vice President Kal Ruttenstein . His new store will attempt to appeal with " clothes that might be a little different in coloration-a little more vibrant and also a lot of black . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
