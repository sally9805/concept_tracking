MODERN TIMES : THE WORLD FROM THE TWENTIES TO THE EIGHTIES by Paul Johnson ; 817pages ; Harper &; Row ; $27.95 <P> " It is one of the dismal lessons of the 20th century , " writes Paul Johnson , " that , once a state is allowed to expand , it is almost impossible to contract . " John son , a lapsed liberal and a former editor of Britain 's New Statesman , blames this condition on an unbridled will to power that was inadvertently released when Newton 's orderly universe fell to Einstein 's theory of relativity . <P> Einstein was no Darth Vader . How ever , Johnson argues , the belief that physical reality depended on where one stood was smuggled by social radicals into the realm of moral truth . The author 's link age to the gentle mathematician is shaky , but his point is strong : moral relativism , the notion that good and evil are matters merely of point of view , is itself an evil . <P> Modern Times is a rip-roaring survey of the pathology of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for most of the totalitarianism and terrorism of the past 60 years . Immoral acts were certainly not invented in the 20th century . But the worst modern tyrants committed their obscenities in the name of secular abstractions . Writes Johnson : " Hitler was totally irreligious and had no interest in honor or ethics . He believed in biological determinism , just as Lenin believed in historical determinism . " Joseph Conrad foresaw the consequences of the unprincipled approach in Under Western Eyes when he wrote : " A violent revolution falls into the hands of narrow-minded fanatics and of tyrannical hypocrites at first . Afterwards comes the turn of all the pretentious intellectual failures of the time . " <P> Johnson supplements this observation with brief , vivid histories that illustrate the natural advantage of the ruthless and unrestrained . All the evidence suggests that the century 's major revolutionary tyrants have killed considerably more of their native populations than the governments they replaced . Lenin and Stalin perverted socialist ideals and millions of Russians died . In Central and Eastern Europe , nationalists succeeded in gaining self-determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The scope and fury of purges by ideologues may even be increasing . In the mid- ' 70s the Communist Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot undertook a savage " ruralization " plan that drove millions of urban Cambodians from their homes and even hospital beds into the countryside . The deaths have never been tallied . The planners of this barbarism were not peasants ; they were teachers , economists and bureaucrats who had studied in France . Observes Johnson : " Like Lenin , they were pure intellectuals . They epitomized the great destructive force of the 20th century : the religious fanatic reincarnated as professional politician . " <P> Modern Times ' golden age is America of the ' 20s . Prosperity and educational opportunity grew vigorously ; art , music and literature made major breakthroughs . Much of this occurred under the unwatchful eyes of Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge , the last Presidents who were able to practice the preachment that government rules best by governing least .                   @ @
