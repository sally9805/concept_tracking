And so glasnost came to reign in the land . The official press offers a multicolored array of ideological paradoxes , every one of which was until recently punishable by a few years of imprisonment . The enforcement of RSFSR Criminal Code Articles 70 ( anti-Soviet propaganda ) and 190 ( a whole bunch of pretexts for dwelling on the same subject in court ) has been suspended ? but not abolished . We already show off political jokes at social gatherings , although simultaneously we check ourselves : God forbid that a joke on something current should turn up . Nothing about current issues , please . The situation is complex ? what if we frighten off the bird of happiness of glasnost and perestroika ? We would once again spend the rest of our lives with our suitcases packed , gathering moss . Is n't it better to have at least the kind of glasnost we 've got now ? one that is handed down from above and adapted to local conditions ? No , it 's not better . It turns out to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this season 's chic little boots . For what if tomorrow they hand down non-glasnost from above ? What if they fill the counters with Stalinist field jackets instead of jeans , and start hyping the style of the austere champions of Leninist ideas ? Then what ? So far glasnost is being treated like Cinderella . The same people who used to guard non-glasnost as the apple of their eye are now promoting glasnost , demonstrating the marvels of cosmetic reeducation . And at the same time they continue to slander people who , risking their lives , nurtured the child born before its time . Is there any logic in this development of events ? Unfortunately , there is . Glasnost is a living and quite domestic creature . It not only barks at evil and evildoers but also serves to protect the existing and not the imaginary order ? with the right leash , collar , and food , of course . Glasnost can cure and it can kill . It can overthrow a monarchy , but it can also perpetuate the reign of a bureaucracy . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they used to say , even more beautifully and more convincingly . And the more peppily they talked about it , the more monstrously injustice triumphed . This girl named " Glasnost " is still a stepdaughter , and those who are the quickest are trying on her glass slipper . And many , too many , people who once rescued the little girl during searches and arrests are still in places where doomsday horrors and torments Would look merciful . Our minds do not penetrate into those vast black holes . And we 're in no hurry to liberate all those who vanished there without a trace . We 're doing well already . As for the others , it 's their problem if they could not size up the situation at the right time . Our media , with all their openness and integrity , are quick and eager to expose anything you can think of So how come they are silent about the fact that the merit and praise for the miraculous survival of that little girl should go not to them but to some brutalized convicts excommunicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Instead , they show us certificates from legal and medical experts stating that the girl named Glasnost was born two years ago . The experts say she is in wonder . ful health and eating well , and if anythinghappens , the child 's parents ? upright , worthy , and , moreover , ideologically correct comrades ? will take care of her . Our descendants will yet pass judgment on the halfheartedness of our convictions , on the degree of our responsibility for the fact that an ideal for which some people have landed in jails and labor camps has been turned before our eyes into a circus and a vanity fair . Is this really what our fathers , grandfathers , and forefathers dreamed of ? No , absolutely not . But then , this looks so much more attractive ... Almighty Opportunism ! Your Majesty , the country is served ! Such progress ! And there are scores of people willing to join ! They bet on glasnost the way people bet on racehorses , hoping for luck . The issue of compromise is not even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days , compromise is in vogue . Glasnost is being used purposefully to suppress the voices of those who do not and will not compromise ? that 's the issue . And our liberal intelligentsia , with its impeccable sensitivity to everything new , does n't mind . Man has not survived by being the strongest but by being the most adaptable . So let 's adapt . But no matter which way you look at it , adapting to the ways of opportunists is not reform . And sending our fair maiden Glasnost to the opportunists for re-education is certainly not the same as freedom of speech and the press . And one more thing . My dear comrades , the ones waiting in line to try on Cinderella 's slipper ! Why waste time waiting when you have no basic respect for the individual and his rights ? Hard as you may try , the slipper wo n't fit on Stalin 's big callused foot . Whether you want to or not , you have to choose ? once and for all between the dictator 's boot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative , except for gangrene and amputation ? not even in these confusing times of ideally restructured opportunism . You still do n't believe me , do you ? Well , just wait and see .
