In dance , the human body defies gravity , time and its own limitations ; it is man 's most eloquent leap toward godliness . Almost a century of the art on film  --  from the cooch dancers of the 1890s to the breakdancers of the 1980s , from the debonair Fred Astaire to the all-pro running back Gene Kelly  --  has immortalized that leap . So there is no need for this coffee-table film to strain as mightily as it does to present itself as a class act . That 's Dancing ! may display Grecian urns to establish the art 's ancient pedigree ; it may keep referring to movies as " the motion picture " ; its narration may drone on with the doughy portentousness of elegies on Oscar night . But this compilation of a thousand or so flying feet shows its class only when it shuts up and lets Astaire put a shine on his shoes or Busby Berkeley deploy his battalion of chorines in giddily precise formations or the Nicholas Brothers take flight and dare each other to come down first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from That 's Entertainment , 1 and 2 , some of the best dance sequences in Hollywood history are missing . The segment devoted to MGM musicals offers not highlights but footlights ; Astaire 's nonpareil work with Ginger Rogers is stinted ( Pick Yourself Up , but not Never Gon na Dance ) ; Cyd Charisse never gets to wrap her mile-long gams around any mere male ; and Rita Hayworth does n't exist . This is filmed dance with one leg tied behind its back . Still , hobble as it does , That 's Dancing ! provides young moviegoers with the chance to see old masters playing God 's music with their feet . R.C.
