While it is easier than ever to be seduced by prepared foods that can be zapped in the microwave , it is also easier than ever to find food that makes nutrition easier to swallow. // In the last 10 years the food industry has discovered that health sells . Supermarkets , once on their way to becoming completely self-service have learned , for example , that people today are buying more fresh fish , and that they want someone to cut it and explain how to cook it . So some supermarkets have put the fishmonger back and have gotten rid of the prewrapped packages. // They have also discovered that if they sell only white bread , their customers will go to the bakery in search of other , more interesting , and usually more healthful varieties. // The case of nonfat yogurt is another example of this healthful-food phenomenon . Eighteen months ago , only one brand of nonfat yogurt was available in the dairy and ice cream aisles . Today there are several. // The other aisles of the supermarket have just as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . Just a few years ago most supermarkets had only a small selection of oils . Last week at a moderate-size Manhattan supermarket there were 22 varieties of olive oils , not to mention corn oils , soybean oils , sunflower , safflower and sesame oils and more . Canola , the latest entry , is made from rapeseed and has less saturated fat than any other oil sold , even olive oil. // But shoppers must nonetheless be on their guard . One vegetable oil , labeled " light and natural , " might lead someone to think it contained less fat and fewer calories than comparable oils . Each tablespoon had exactly the same number of calories as the other oils , 120 , and the same amount of fat , 14 grams . Light , no doubt , refers to the much lighter color of the oil. // The other half of the salad dressing equation , the vinegar , now comes in more than white and cider . There is a variety of wine vinegars , including those flavored with raspberry , shallots or tarragon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vinegar . The rice , balsamic and fruit-flavored vinegars are mellower than standard vinegars , making it possible to create a salad dressing with far less oil. // Until a few years ago supermarkets did not acknowledge the existence of brown rice . Today there are usually a couple of brands stocked . In addition there is a much greater assortment of grains , not just buckwheat groats ( kasha ) , which has been there for years , but couscous , Texmati ( a form of Indian basmati rice ) , pecan-flavored rice and arborio , the Italian rice with which risotto is made. // Over in the bread department confusion reigns . In addition to eight varieties of 100 percent whole-wheat bread and rolls that were available last week in a Manhattan market , there were high-fiber breads , oatmeal breads , wheat germ breads and , sprouted wheat breads. // The only breads that actually contain 100 percent whole wheat are those that carry the words " 100 percent " and that specify whole-wheat flour in the ingredients . The term " wheat flour " just means white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : one slice of whole-wheat bread , about one ounce , contains two grams of dietary fiber . Some varieties do not list the fiber at all , usually because there is none ; others contain one gram. // There are also some very palatable snack crackers that are low in fat and in sodium : a startling selection of melba toasts ; 100 percent whole- wheat matzoh that has only 110 calories per piece , no fat and no sodium , and rice crackers that are very satisfying even though each one contains only 35 calories and no fat . All these crackers come in salt-free versions. // The cereal aisle offers almost as much wheat bran and oat bran cereals as it does sugared cereals . At last count there were 18 products including oats in some form or other. // Throughout the stores the assortment of low-sodium products is impressive . Just a few years ago it was impossible to buy low-sodium soup except in a specialty market ; now there are many available . Years ago Campbell Soups tried to bring out low-sodium soups but no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are low-sodium canned vegetables , particularly in the spectrum of canned tomato products , from puree and sauce to paste and whole tomatoes . There are salt-free bread crumbs , peanut butter and now spaghetti sauces . Conventional spaghetti sauces can contain 800 milligrams or more of salt per four-ounce serving . Those marked " low sodium " may have as few as 35 milligrams. // All this and we haven ' t even visited the produce section yet . Green peppers have been joined by orange , red and yellow peppers . Ordinary button mushrooms are surrounded by cremini , shiitake , enoki and often other varieties . Kirby cucumbers are almost as ordinary as waxed ones. // In the meat section , beef is more carefully trimmed . In some supermarkets beef graded select , with less fat than choice or prime , is being heavily promoted . Ground turkey , even with 7 percent fat , has far less fat than regular ground beef , although it has only a little less fat than extra-lean ground beef , which is usually 10 percent fat . Boneless turkey breasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative to veal. // There are coffee beans decaffeinated by the water method instead of with methylene chloride , a chemical whose safety has been questioned . More canned tuna today comes packed in water than in oil . Club soda has almost been edged out by seltzer and other sparkling waters . Fruit is packed in its own juices instead of in heavy syrup . Fruit conserves , made without sugar , are often a bit lower in calories than regular jams. // There ' s only one trouble with all this bounty . When you feel obligated to read all the labels , it takes much longer to shop. //
