Ever since I had the use of reason , the name Jesus Christ was one of the most familiar in my house and in school during my infancy and adolescence . I never saw a contradiction between the ideas that sustain me and the ideas of that symbol , of that extraordinary figure . . . <P> This may not seem to be the most stirring spiritual testimony on record  --  but consider the source . The words are those of Cuban President Fidel Castro , whose Communist regime has expelled bishops and priests , eliminated church schools , made it difficult for practicing Christians to get government jobs and even discouraged the observance of Christmas because it impeded the sugar- cane harvest . Pronouncements on faith , however , surface regularly in Fidel and Religion : Conversations with Friar Betto , just published in Cuba with Castro 's own imprimatur . It is proving to be an instant hit : when the 379-page volume went on sale in Havana bookstores three weeks ago , lines of purchasers stretched for blocks . <P> The book is drawn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betto , 41 , born Carlos Alberto Libanio Christo . The author , a Dominican brother in Sao Paulo , Brazil , is a leftist churchman who served four years in a Brazilian prison for sheltering anti-government guerrillas . He embraces liberation theology , which offers theological support for resisting political and economic oppression and is usually based on Marxist analysis . <P> Fidel and Religion offers some rare glimpses into the Cuban leader 's youth . He was raised in Oriente province , a region that had no resident priests , but his childhood home was full of religious objects . His mother was a " fervent Christian " who prayed daily and lit candles to the Virgin Mary and the saints . His father , a well-to-do farmer , had no time for religion . Castro was not baptized until he was five or six , but all his education until university was in Roman Catholic schools . " If someone were to ask , ' When did you have a religious conviction ? ' I 'd say I never really had one , " says Castro . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those values . " <P> In the book , Castro basically views Christianity as useful for revolution . Disagreeing with Karl Marx , he does not think religion is necessarily the opiate of the people . That depends , says Castro , on whether it is used to defend the rich . He sees great promise in Latin American Catholicism 's shift from a traditional alliance with " oppressors " to greater concern for the poor . Says he : " There are 10,000 more coincidences between Christianity and Communism than there could be with capitalism . " Liberation theology , he exults , is " a re-encounter of Christianity with its roots , with its most beautiful , heroic and most glorious history . " He also calls it " one of the most fundamental happenings that have occurred in our epoch . "
