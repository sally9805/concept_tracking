NEW YORK  --  The New York insurance superintendent began examining government bond-trading losses that cost Marsh &; McLennan Cos. $60 million , amid indications that the losses resulted from unauthorized investment of insurance premiums paid by businesses . Meanwhile , traders in cash and futures markets for U.S. government securities estimated Marsh &; McLennan ' s bond position at $500 million to $2 billion , depending on how highly leveraged the position was and when it was acquired . Government bonds continued to fall yesterday as a result of the loss disclosure , which prompted widespread speculation that the company soon would be selling huge amounts of U.S. securities . Interest-rate futures also fell . Marsh &; McLennan , the world ' s largest insurance broker , has been tight-lipped about how the losses occurred . But it indicated that the losses resulted from investment of businesses ' insurance premiums that were held 15 to 45 days before it turned them over to insurance underwriting companies . Although such investment is normal and legal , it generally is limited to short-term money-market instruments . Marsh &; McLennan said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflects " anticipated losses in government bond positions accumulated by a bond trader. . . in violation of authorized trading limits . " The company declined to elaborate on its brief statement , which didn ' t indicate the size of the bond position or how the trader could have violated its rules and avoided detection . The insurance superintendent ' s staff is " reviewing the situation , " a spokesman said , to determine " whether insurance premium funds were used for speculative bond purchases . " The spokesman , Barry Greenhouse , said it appears " the kind of investments that permitted a loss of this kind couldn ' t have been permissible under either our regulations or those Marsh &; McLennan has set up . " He said a formal investigation would follow if the superintendent ' s staff determines that insurance premium funds were used to finance the bond positions . Marsh &; McLennan common shares fell $1. 875 yesterday to $44. 25 in heavy New York Stock Exchange composite trading . The shares opened at $43. 50 yesterday , down sharply from Monday ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 875 Monday . Several government bond traders said they find it hard to believe Marsh &; McLennan officials didn ' t know about the trading that the firm termed " unauthorized . " " That ' s an awful lot of tickets to hide in a drawer , " said one dealer . " You ' d have to have an awfully big drawer to keep them from top management . " Insurance analysts also expressed skepticism about management procedures at Marsh &; McLennan , which had been regarded as the best-managed of the large U.S. insurance brokers . " It looked like somebody went bananas and management didn ' t have the proper controls in place , " said Herbert E. Goodfriend , an insurance analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities . He said Marsh &; McLennan typically had $100 million of premium funds daily that it could invest for 15 to 45 days . It couldn ' t be determined whether Marsh &; McLennan has completely liquidated the unauthorized bond position . Traders said Morgan Stanley &; Co. was helping liquidate the position , but the head of Morgan Stanley ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading activity Monday in Treasury-bond futures at the Chicago Board of Trade by Virginia Trading Corp. led to speculation that Virginia Trading may have bought bonds from Marsh &; McLennan and then hedged the purchase by selling 7 , 000 futures contracts , valued at $700 million face amount of bonds . Virginia Trading then bought 3 , 000 contracts yesterday , leading to speculation that it had sold part of its bond position . One source in Chicago , however , said that major securities firms , including Morgan Stanley , have accounts at Virginia Trading and that Virginia ' s futures activity could have been on behalf of a firm liquidating and trying to hedge Marsh &; McLennan ' s portfolio . Brokers for Virginia Trading couldn ' t be reached for comment . Credit : Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal
