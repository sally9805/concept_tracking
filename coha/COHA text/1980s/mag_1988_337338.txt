Spain 's Torrejon Air Base outside Madrid boasts the longest runway in Western Europe . Last week , as usual , that shimmering 2.8-mile ribbon of concrete served as takeoff and touchdown point for U.S. F-16 fighters flying daily practice missions . But suburban Madrilenos , grown used to wincing at the ear- splitting shriek from the planes , took comfort in the knowledge that they would not have to endure it indefinitely . As the result of negotiations between the U.S. and the Socialist government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez , the 79 F-16s flown by the U.S. Air Force 's 401st Tactical Fighter Wing must leave Torrejon by May 1991 . The pullout will take place to Washington 's regret  --  but at Madrid 's insistence . <P> One less U.S. fighting unit around the world may not significantly affect the global balance of power . But Torrejon is by no means the only U.S. military outpost whose future has been called into question by a host government . Partly because of a chance convergence of treaty expiration dates , but mainly because many countries are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their soil , the U.S. could soon be facing a global basing crisis . Washington has already been asked to withdraw installations from such friendly nations as Thailand and Pakistan , and some strategists warn that the day may come when Washington will be forced to find alternatives to overseas bases as a means of projecting its strategic power . <P> While the " de-basing " phenomenon has not quite reached that point , defense agreements covering U.S. installations in five nations , four of them NATO allies , are the subject of intense and sometimes rancorous negotiations . " This is a watershed issue that ca n't help but affect American security , " says Frank Gaffney , a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense , now at the American Enterprise Institute , a conservative Washington think tank . Items : <P>  --  Negotiators are working against a May 14 deadline to reach agreement on three major U.S. military installations in Spain besides Torrejon . The Gonzalez government has agreed in principle to permitting continued U.S. access to any of the three . But Spanish public opinion is hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily Diario 16 showed that 48% of those questioned favored total withdrawal of U.S. bases from Spanish territory . <P>  --  Portugal has requested a review of its eight-year treaty permitting the U.S. use of the Lajes Air Base in the Azores . The reason , says right-of-center Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva , is that the agreement " is not being entirely respected . " Translation : because of congressional cuts , the $147 million in U.S. aid that Portugal received last year was substantially less than it expected . <P>  --  U.S. and Greek negotiators have been meeting since November to discuss a follow-up to their current bases treaty , which expires next December . The Socialist government of Andreas Papandreou is seeking an increase in the level of U.S. aid it receives  --  $430 million in 1987  --  as part of a deal allowing Washington to continue using its four Greek bases .
