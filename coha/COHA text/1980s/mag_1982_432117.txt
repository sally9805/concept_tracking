 | Faced with mounting opposition to huge federal deficits , Ronald Reagan is taking the offensive to restore confidence in his economic stewardship . " Put up or shut up " ? the President 's blunt message to critics during his earlyFebruary trip to the Midwest ? was the opening volley in what promises to be an aggressive campaign of public appearances in defense of his antirecession strategy . Reagan turned combative in response to a barrage of criticism from Republicans as well as Democrats , and conservatives as well as liberals . Never before since entering the White House had his leadership been challenged so widely . Everywhere he turned , the chief complaint was the same : That the 91.5-billion-dollar deficit projected in the admon ' budget was too much . On Wall Street , news of the deficit sent the stock and bond markets into tailspins . Stock prices fell to a fourmonth low on February 8 , the day the new budget was unveiled at the White House . Economists warned that federal borrowing to finance the deficit would drive up interest rates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders of both parties scrambled for ways to reduce the red ink . A spending freeze , defense cuts and new taxes were among ideas hashed over . Senator Bob Dole ( R-Kans. ) confessed that even some loyal Republicans were " frightened " by the big deficit . Elsewhere in the country , skepticism ran high . It was focused not only on the deficit but also on some 27 billion dollars in additional cuts in federal programs that Reagan wants for 1983 . Mayors , governors and state legislators predicted dire consequences for the states , which are heavily dependent on federal money . In Minneapolis , Des Moines and Indianapolis , Reagan was met by crowds of protesters with placards carrying such messages as " Mr. President , you are wrong , " and " Welcome , President Hoover . " Even among the Chief Executive 's top advisers , who had failed to convince him to propose tax increases to hold down the deficit , there was little enthusiasm for the new budget . On the hustings , Reagan dismissed his critics as " demagogues , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their attacks seemed only to stiffen his spine . " We have faith in our program , and we are sticking with it , " he declared . " Yes , the deficit is too big . But I 'm not about to use a magic pencil or merely create a balanced budget or a lower deficit , as has been done in the past . " " Puzzle palace . " The President pleaded with Americans to give his program time . He repeated assurances of " supply side " economists in his administration that stimulative tax cuts enacted last year will begin to pull the economy out of recession by midsummer . That is the message that Reagan will carry to Wyoming , New Mexico , Alabama , Tennessee and Oklahoma in a series of campaign-style speeches over  | the next month . The President intends to return more than once to the harsh rhetoric he used during the Midwest swing , aides say . He will also portray himself at times as a Washington outsider , just as he did in Des Moines on February 9 when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Potomac . " The administration 's New Federalism plan ? turning over more than 40 federal programs entirely to the states in the years ahead ? will be shoved aside for now to enable the White House to concentrate on the budget battle . Members of Congress , along with mayors , governors and other opinion leaders , will be invited to the Oval Office for heart-to-heart talks , as they were in 1981 . But to a large degee , Reagan will abandon his nice-guy style when it comes to dealing with Congress . From every sign , the coalition of Republicans and conservative Democrats that enacted the administration 's 1982 budget will be hard to reassemble . Democrats quickly seized on the big deficits as an issue to use against Republicans in the November elections . Former Vice President Walter Mondale , testing the waters for a possible presidential bid in 1984 , set out across the country to attack Reagan 's policies . House Speaker Thomas P. " Tip " O'Neill ( D-Mass. ) condemned the administration plan as a " Beverly Hills budget , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealthy , billions in handouts to the nation 's corporations and billions for lavish new defense systems , " while cutting back aid to the poor . Conservative Democrats ? known as " Boll Weevils " ? who supported Reagan 's spending plans last year , denounced the new budget . " The deficit must be cut , " declared Representative Charles Stenholm ( D-Tex . ) . What surprised ? and disappointed ? White House officials most were the many Republican voices included in the chorus of adverse reaction . GOP leaders felt let down by a President who had campaigned beside them in 1980 for a balanced budget . Senator Dan Quayle ( R-Ind. ) condemned the deficit as " unacceptable . " Senator Alan Simpson ( R-Wyo. ) said budget cuts had " alienated every single constituency in the United States including mothers and children . " Many Republicans as well as Democrats rejected the President 's claim that the 1983 deficit would not exceed 91.5 billion dollars . Most forecasters say it could rise far above 100 billion . In every year since 1977 , federal spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars . Still , despite Reagan 's challenge to " put up or shut up , " few members of Congress were prepared to offer an immediate alternative to the administration 's budget . Bipartisan consultations aimed at fashioning a counterproposal got under way . Some new ideas began to surface independently . One widely debated plan ? to freeze federal spending during 1983 at 1982 levels ? met with a mixed reaction . Budget analysts estimated that such a freeze would cut the deficit by as much as 40 billion dollars . Proposed by Senator Ernest F. Hollings ( D-S.C. ) , the freeze was seen as a step in the right direction by some lawmakers . Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker ( R-Tenn. ) described it as " intriguing and worthwhile . " But both liberals and conservatives found big flaws in the idea . Another proposal put forth by Democrats would speed up the income-tax reduction scheduled to take effect in July and abolish another tax cut due in 1983 . White House officials welcomed an earlier cut in 1982 but rejected elimination of the 1983 step . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic blueprint would be altered substantially . Decisive votes are expected to begin in midsummer , at the time that everyone will be watching for signs of economic recovery . A preliminary skirmish could come in May , when Congress will be asked to raise the ceiling on federal debt , now at 1.08 trillion dollars . Added to the difficulties facing Reagan are the problems inherent in deal- ing with Congress in an election year . Most members will be loath to raise taxes or to cut benefits while they are running for re-election . Thus , cuts in social programs and changes in the tax tables could end up being delayed until after the balloting in November . Still , many congressional experts predict that Congress will make these changes in Reagan 's budget : Cut 5 to 10 billion dollars from the defense buildup . Foreign military assistance is a prime target for reductions . Block billions of dollars in cuts that Reagan wants in social programs such as medicare , medicaid , student loans , food stamps , welfare and housing subsidies . Bar 1983 cost-of-living increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social Security benefits are not likely to be frozen , however . Some of these changes would reduce the deficit . Others would boost it substantially . Many analysts expect that , on balance , Congress 's revisions in the President 's spending plans will threaten to drive 1983 red ink as high as 130 billion dollars . As a result , there will be strong pressure for tax increases to raise revenues . Deeper bite on industry ? Business is shaping up as the chief target of any tax hike for fiscal 1983 . Sentiment is building in Congress to reverse last year 's decision to allow businesses to sell their tax breaks . A strengthened minimum tax for individuals as well as businesses is also being widely discussed on Capitol Hill . As for the President , he is not talking compromise ? at least not yet . As he sees it , his critics should either " give the American people a better alternative or join with us in our efforts to set the economy right . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
