The young man on the videotape appeared pale and tired , but his identity was unmistakable . He was Wuer Kaixi , 21 , the former Beijing Normal University freshman who emerged as the most charismatic leader during the student uprising in China , then disappeared after the massacre in Tiananmen Square . He evidently spoke from hiding in Hong Kong , where he is believed to have fled in mid-June through Macao . Thanks to an effective underground of sympathizers , only six of the 21 most-wanted student leaders have been apprehended . Wuer 's friends say he may go to the U.S. to organize an alliance to continue the struggle . <P> Wuer 's message was an emotional call to arms to Chinese dissidents . " Those of us who remain alive , our lives are no longer our own . . . We have to be responsible in our struggle for democracy and for science . We have to be responsible to the martyrs . " Wuer said there were many that night . " Simply put , " he continued , " on June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went sick . " He said he saw " many comrades and compatriots " killed and beaten by " bestial , fascist troops " or " crushed to death and flattened out by tanks . " In a separate statement , he likened the present rule in Beijing to " a black sun " that rose " on the day in June that should have belonged to a season of fresh flowers . " He predicted that it would not last long : " Black sun , I 'm going to shoot you down . "
