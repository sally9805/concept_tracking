Movies , and perhaps especially American movies , have a way of latching onto social - a-  problems of some complexity and then not knowing quite what to do with them . The waffling occurs , as I said when writing about Prince of the City , because movie makers are in show business and must shape their products to the expectations of a very large audience . It happens also because most films are put together by teams of skilled professionals and do not reflect the convictions of a single creative imagination . All four of the movies I have seen recently are technically impressive  --  cunningly plotted , skillfully performed and splendidly photographed  --  and three of them deal with topics of substantial public concern . They are honest commodities to the extent that they engage and beguile you , but not one of them grasps its subject with sufficient resolution to challenge an audience or remain long in its memory . The problem examined in Neil Simon 's Only When I Laugh is alcoholism . The victim of this malady is an actress in her early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is : merging , a bit timidly , from twelve weeks in a private clinic . She is driven home by a lifelong friend ( Joan Hackett ) , greeted there by an adoring homosexual ( James Coco ) and soon joined by her stalwart , clear-eyed teen-age daughter ( Kristy McNichol ) . The future looks at least promising , but , as so often happens to reformed drunks , life sneaks up on her . Her former lover , who has written a play about their tempestuous affair , hasfound a new , much younger companion ; the old friend is suddenly ditched by her husband ; the tenderly supportive homosexual is fired from the first decent stage part he has been given in years . The heroine takes a sip of champagne to steady her nerves , and the next thing she knows she is staggering home , bruised and bloody from a struggle with a stranger she picked up in a bar . She is obviously in no shape to have lunch the next day with her daughter and former husband , but , by force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some well-cut clothes , she keeps the date and there are smiles of victory all around . Simon knows about alcoholism ; he also knows that a drunkard 's chronicle is grim stuff and that he has a reputation to maintain as an entertainer . So he sweetens the tale by drawing on his gift for coining nifty one-liners . Reviewing a recent biography of the British writer Saki ( H.H. Munro ) , Rhoda Koenig remarks that his characters " rabbit away at each other in dialogue wittier and cleverer than that heard across any real-life restaurant tables " The New York Review of Books , October 8 . So do the people in Only When I Laugh  --  in their darkest moments their conversation fizzes like that fatal glass of champagne . It is a device that both entertains and estranges an audience , the characters coming to seem less persons in their own right than agents of their author 's gift for epigram . The most memorable line in the film is the heroine 's statement to her daughter , " When I grow up I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's relentless excellence of mind and spirit , that remark might be taken as a pathetically bitter put-down , but , conditioned by then to badinage , the audience guffaws . Of course , people in trouble do sometimes take shelter behind black humor , but that sort of dialogue , used persistently , turns characters brittle . No one with any experience of booze will take much comfort from the luncheon of hope and forgiveness , but then the whole film seems more clever than concerned . True Confessions co-stars Robert De Niro and Robert Duvall , two of the most assertive and highly esteemed of contemporary actors . That duplication of drawing power is an old theatrical device  --  you will recall Bing Crosby and Bob Hope , and , in the latter days of the traveling theater troupes that performed Uncle Tom 's Cabin , productions were advertised as featuring two Little Evas . If you want to see True Confessions , plan to get to the theater an hour in advance . It is a good show ; how could it not be with De Niro and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monsignor of the Los Angeles diocese and the heir apparent to the cardinal ; Duvall is a tough detective with a sordid background and a savage hatred of powerfully situated criminals . Des Spellacy , the priest , is interested in raising money to advance God 's work ( and perhaps his own career ) ; Tom Spellacy , the cop , is determined to solve a particularly nasty murder ( and perhaps atone for an old sin of his own ) . The attention of both brothers becomes focused on Jack Amsterdam ( Charles Durning ) , a beefy building contractor and distinguished Catholic layman . The script , from a book by John Gregory Dunne , was written by Dunne and Joan Didion ; the story is set in the 1940s and is said to be based in part on real events . The two stars  --  supported by a strong cast that includes Cyril Cusack , Burgess Meredith and Rose Gregorio  --  are as always hypnotically compelling , and they play characters who are equally strong and similarly vulnerable to the sin of pride . They are humbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this occurs is obscure . The almost too skillful plot , whose intricacies mesh like the gears of an elegant machine , moves steadily toward a showdown that never happens . Instead , the action jumps forward some years to a sentimental epilogue . The motif of the picture is corruption , and it comes close to saying ( there is one saintly figure to serve as a bench mark ) that everyone is corrupt  --  an assertion as absolving as the generalization that we are all guilty of some conspicuous atrocity . But when it comes to the point of assaying the moral positions of the people with whom it is immediately concerned , the movie sheers off , and we are left with the soothing image of the brothers , arm in arm , gazing on the modest burial plot where someday they will lie peacefully side by side . For all its persuasive verisimilitude , the picture has implausible moments . When , in quick succession , the contractor and the cop enter the confessional to harass the priest , I was forcefully reminded that I was watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much a salute to old movies as a reconstruction of an old scandal . De Niro and Duvall have been given juicy parts , but they have been juicy for some time . Even the battered hat worn by the cop recalls other celebrated heads . Ulu Grosbard is an effective director , but it may be that he admires what has been done in the past too much to impose his own accent on True Confessions . I was gripped by the picture , but in the end it was just another picture . The problem addressed in Carbon Copy is racism , and the task undertaken by its inventors is to treat this ugly subject in intimate detail without becoming oppressively serious or offending anyone too deeply . The film gets away with it rather smartly , but somewhat dulls its scalpel in the process . The method is to cast the hero as a courageous clown and his foes as monsters of hypocritical bigotry . It then resolves his difficulties with a surprise ending that sends us all home as happy as larks . George Segal plays an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of respect for the sensibilities prevailing in the world of big corporations and exclusive country clubs where he is thriving at some cost to his self-respect . However , the film is only incidentally about anti-Semitism . Some years earlier , Walter had lived for a happy time with a black woman , and one day  --  a day that had begun badly for him , with coordinated assaults by his frigid wife and his insolent stepdaughter  --  a black youth in sneakers walks into his office , sits down at his desk , looks around the room with mocking admiration and says , " Hello , Dad . " Walter does n't like the boy , who is provocatively unlikable , but neither does he propose to turn his son away . As a result , he almost immediately finds himself without a wife , a home , a job , a bank account , a Rolls-Royce or a credit card . His father-in-law , who is also president of the company , had been keeping Walter on leading strings . Father and son take refuge in a sleazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they grow closer , though the boy continues to watch his father with ironic detachment . I wo n't go into the details of Walter 's struggle to survive , but survive he does by pluck and pratfall , and when the family repents and invites him home , he waves them away . Meanwhile , to give you a measure of the comedy , he has entered his former home as a masked burglar and raped his more than willing wife . Then comes the happy surprise  --  young Roger does not turn out to be a nice white boy in blackface , but he is the next most acceptable thing : a nice black boy who is halfway through medical school on a national scholarship . He was only pretending to be an anti-whitey petty criminal to test how much his daddy had really loved his saintly , now deceased , mother . Segal is routinely good as a cornered worm ; Denzel Washington , relatively new to the wonderland of movies , has a charming smile , but seems a little mechanical as the masquerading Roger ; Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wife , appear stunned by the excesses demanded of them . Carbon Copy throws a few gentle jabs on behalf of tolerance and brotherhood , and though I am all for exposing bigotry to the light of day , I prefer that it not be quite so foolishly sunny a day . Stanley Shapiro wrote the screenplay ; Michael Schultz directed . Continental Divide deals with nothing that could be called a social problem ; it is a slapstick comedy of mismated lovers and its only aim is to roll you in the aisles . I went to see it because it stars John Belushi , who , with Dan Aykroyd , entertained me well in The Blues Brothers , and I thought that half the team would be at least half as rewarding . It was more a case of one hand clapping  --  not much percussion . The tale , which matches a tough , crusading Chicago columnist against a gloriously wholesome naturalist ( Blair Brown ) who perches high in the Rockies to spy on bald eagles , is an unusually implausible replay of beauty and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a parody of such assembly-line crowd pleasers . Not knowing whether to laugh with or at Belushi and Brown , I did little of either . However , the soaring eagles were great . Michael Apted directed from a script by Lawrence Kasdan.
