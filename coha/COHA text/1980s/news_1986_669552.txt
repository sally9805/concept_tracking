Few Britons even knew who he was , or what he did . Even fewer could guess how much their individual rights and freedoms in one of the Western world ' s most secretive societies are indirectly shaped by this head of the British civil service. // Sir Robert Armstrong , Cabinet secretary and principal adviser to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , has every reason to prefer a low profile . As Britain ' s most senior civil servant , he has an almost unparalleled knowledge of British Cabinet secrets and intelligence operations . He wants to make sure they stay secret. // // That ' s why he has been taking a leading role in his government ' s efforts to thwart disclosures in Australia by former MI5 ( British secret service ) agent Peter Wright , who lives in Tasmania . Referring to the Australian court case , a British government source says : ' ' We are pursuing a point of principle . The principle is that of lifelong confidentiality for those who serve in government. ' ' // Sir Robert ' s defense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain - a nation where information is probably more zealously guarded than in any other Western democracy . Roy Jenkins , a former home secretary and chancellor of the Exchequer in Labour governments , and a past president of the European Commission , is among those calling this country ' s government ' ' the most secretive in the Western world. ' ' // No freedom of information // BRITAIN , unlike the United States or its Commonwealth counterparts , Canada , Australia , and New Zealand , has no Freedom of Information Act . Nor does Britain afford its citizens many of the information protections that are provided in other West European democracies. // Des Wilson , chairman of the Campaign for Freedom of Information and current president of the Liberal Party , claims that ' ' when it comes to the real information people need for democracy to really operate as it should , the situation is appalling and getting steadily worse . For instance , very little background information on government decisionmaking is available. ' ' // There are some modest signs of change , some slight challenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next November , for instance , people will be given the right , under the Data Protection Act , to see some of the files on them held in computers . And some 150 members of Parliament , representing Conservative , Labour , Social Democratic , and Liberal Parties - but , significantly , not the Conservative government itself - are calling for the repeal of the Official Secrets Act ' s controversial Section 2 , which forbids leaking any official information , however trivial . What they want in its place is a Freedom of Information Act with exemption clauses covering national security and privacy. // But Britain has a long way to go to catch up with its fellow Western democracies in this far-reaching area. // Anthony Sampson , whose ' ' Anatomy of Britain ' ' is regarded as something of a primer of contemporary Britain , wrote , ' ' Secrecy is one of the British obsessions , like class , which seems to express a deeper psychological need , as if it were a substitute for the mystery of a religion . Power in Britain originated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' // Embarrassing setbacks in the British MI5 case in Australia have increased concern over Britain ' s obsession with secrecy and over the extraordinary lengths to which the government is prepared to go to protect itself it under the Official Secrets Act. // Despite much self-inflicted damage , the government feels that to be consistent in upholding confidentiality it has no alternative but to pursue its case . Critics charge that the government ' s tactics work against its own interests by attracting attention to what it is trying to hide. // In addition , Mr. Wilson maintains , secrecy can be costly , because without public accountability , corruption and waste are more easily concealed . The big issue of secrecy in Britain today , he says , is not just over what happens between Westminster and Whitehall , the centers of parliamentary and bureaucratic power ; it is the way secrecy ' ' affects people in everyday life . It ' s the extent to which secrecy makes it impossible for individuals to represent themselves at the local level. ' ' // In Britain you have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s school records . If you want to find out why your mortgage was turned down , or if you have a quarrel with the insurance company , the files are off limits . Clients of social workers have no right of access to extensive files kept on them . The same is true of tenants of local housing authorities . As a result , they are often unable to check on the accuracy of such records. // Archy Kirkwood , a Liberal member of Parliament , plans to introduce a ' ' private member ' s bill ' ' that , if passed , would give people the right to inspect and correct personal files held on them by doctors , employers , and local authorities. // Another area ' ' bedeviled with secrecy , ' ' according to Wilson , is the environment . The location of some 2 , 000 major hazard sites are regarded as official information . Because of that , people living in those areas can not be informed of potentially dangerous chemical hazards. // Two years ago , Sir Richard Southwood , chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the No. 1 obstacle to better environmental protection in Britain. // Local water authorities , for instance , meet in secret . As such , they have no accountability to the public , even though the public pays water rates ( taxes ) and even though these authorities are responsible for such critical areas as public health , safety , and the building of reservoirs and sewage works. // On seemingly innocuous topics , the government can still plead privileged information . A citizen ' s request for a report on bicycle safety , for instance , was turned down by the Ministry of Transport on the grounds that the information was ' ' restricted . ' ' In 1979 the government refused to answer parliamentary questions on such mundane issues as agricultural workers ' wages , forecasts of changes in food prices , and day-to-day matters of the agricultural and fish marketing boards. // Secrecy at odds with democracy ? // THERE are now more than 100 statutes that make disclosure of such official information a criminal offense . Wilson says such secrecy has become institutionalized over the years. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the blame. // ' ' People learn to live with what they ' re used to , ' ' he says . ' ' I go out and give talks to groups around the country . I tell them , ' I can ' t believe your docility. ' ' ' // The impression of Britain as a society more secretive than other comparable democracies is at odds with the country ' s reputation as a liberal democracy . Britain not only is the ' ' Mother of Parliaments , ' ' but it also laid the foundations for representative democracy and individual liberty with the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215. // Roy Jenkins , an erudite and urbane politician , and one of the founders of the Social Democratic Party ( SDP ) , has an explanation for this apparent contradiction : ' ' It ' s partly because on constitutional and institutional matters , this country got peculiarly stuck in the form of government peculiar to the end of the last century , ' ' he said in an interview at his office close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very much founded on the view most clearly and most seminally promulgated by ( English jurist Albert ) Dicey in the ' 70s and ' 80s of the last century in which he promulgated and took pride in the absolute sovereignty of Parliament , ' ' he says . ' ' This belief in the absolute sovereignty of the British Parliament fits extremely uncomfortably with our subscribing to any international human rights conventions , be it the UN or the Council of Europe expressing itself through the Strasbourg Court. ' ' // An ' ' unwillingness , ' ' as he puts it , to introduce any external law means that Britain has not followed through on many of the contemporary pieces of human rights legislation - including equality of race and the rights of immigrants - that have been established in other democracies such as the US. // The inadequate protection of the rights of individuals means that Britain has been arraigned more frequently before the European Court than its European partners have. // ' ' We lead Europe in the amount of work we provide for international human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our prison population , the Turks having given up that race in despair , ' ' said Roy Jenkins in a much quoted speech at the SDP conference in September. // It is because of the supremacy of Parliament - in which all power , both executive and legislative , is concentrated - that the prime minister resists amending or scrapping Section 2 , which is the controversial aspect of the Official Secrets Act . Section 1 , which deals with espionage , is not considered contentious . The prime minister argues that a Freedom of Information Act would reduce the parliamentary accountability of ministers. // A Fifth Amendment country // MOREOVER , Britain does not have a system of checks and balances such as that in the US . The closest Britain comes to it is the House of Lords , which in recent years has shown a notable degree of independence from the House of Commons , despite its modest real power . The gusts of reform that can periodically blow through the US judiciary have no British equivalent . There is nothing in Britain comparable to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such prominent areas as schools , busing , and rights of minorities. // Nor , as Sir William Rees-Mogg , chairman of the Arts Council and a former editor of The Times ( London ) , points out , does freedom of the press rank as high in the hierarchy of liberties here as it does in the US. // ' ' We are a Fifth Amendment country and they ( the US ) are a First Amendment country , ' ' says Sir William , emphasizing the British tendency to stress withholding information , compared with the importance of free speech in the US. // The potential for an adversarial relationship between the news media and government is possibly greater in Britain if only because of the government ' s considerable hold on information . As Wilson puts it : ' ' Information is power. ' ' // Past Labour governments have been no less critical than Conservative governments in charging the British Broadcasting Corporation with bias. // For instance , the Conservative Party charged that BBC coverage of the US raid on Libya was biased ; the BBC vigorously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakened by a damaging libel case brought against it by two Conservative members of Parliament. // And the BBC ' s vulnerability to government pressure was evidenced when it was discovered that an agent of MI5 was ensconced in a small room at the BBC busily checking candidates for senior BBC positions. // While people have long had the right to vote in Britain , they do not have the ' ' right to know . ' ' When pressed during the MI5 trial as to whether the British public had the right to know - a cherished American principle - a Downing Street official answered robustly , ' ' To hell with the public ' s right to know . ' ' In this official ' s view , what the public really should be concerned about was the ' ' security of the state , not in indulging a secret agent. ' ' // As if to reinforce the point of the supremacy of government , the Downing Street official laid down what is a truism about the government ' s right to privileged information : ' ' There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no right to know. ' ' // Official Secrets ' Section 2 // THE government ' s principal weapon for safeguarding secrecy , and for penalizing the officials and the reporters who contravene it , is Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act of 1911 - the product of spy mania at the time when Britain became alarmed at the rise of German militarism . An imprecise weapon , likened more to a rusty old blunderbuss than a modern Armalite rifle , Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act has produced surprisingly few convictions . But its effect is largely intimidatory. // Asked if it affected even the most senior civil servants , Sir Burke Trend , then the Cabinet secretary , appearing in 1971 before the Franks Committee , set up to look into Section 2 , replied , ' ' . . . you are conscious at the back of everything you say and do all day long there is this tremendous sanction. ' ' // Although Section 2 now is regarded as largely unenforceable , it can strike with quite unusual severity . In 1984 , Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only fired but also prosecuted as a criminal and sentenced to six months ' imprisonment for leaking information - even though the court declared that her actions did not threaten national security. // Yet , in recent years Section 2 has become increasingly discredited. // When asked recently on television whether Section 2 wasn ' t ' ' a reprehensible act , ' ' Sir Patrick Nairne , the permanent secretary from 1975 to 1981 , replied , ' ' Almost everybody accepts that it is. ' ' // The difficulty , he said , is deciding what would replace it. // Previous Labour and Conservative governments , when in opposition , have pledged to reform the legislation . But such enthusiasm seems to evaporate on taking office. // Sir William Rees-Mogg says there is no question the Official Secrets Act is ' ' a bad act. ' ' // But he also indicated that its terms of reference were so broad as to blunt its effectiveness. // ' ' Juries , ' ' he points out in the paneled library of his antiquarian publishing company on Pall Mall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act unless they feel there is moral as well as technical guilt . ' ' Nor , he adds , will they convict when there is ' ' no element of espionage and the motive is one of conscience. ' ' // That apparently was the reason for the jury acquittal of a senior civil servant , Clive Ponting , who was charged under Section 2 for leaking information to a Labour member of Parliament , Tam Dalyell , about the sinking of the Argentine cruiser Belgrano during the Falklands war. // The government was outraged that Mr. Ponting , who as a civil servant had taken an oath of loyalty to the government , had leaked information to a member of Parliament . But Ponting , who won his argument on the basis that the minister he was serving had lied , claimed he had a higher responsibility . He argued his accountability in this case was to Parliament , not to the minister. // The case disturbed the government lest it give license to any aggrieved civil servant to break his oath of loyalty and disclose sensitive information. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Section 2 . As far back as 1972 the Franks Commission argued that any law that impinged on the freedom of information in a democracy should be much more tightly drawn . ' ' We found Section 2 . . . a mess , ' ' the report said. // As a former editor , Sir William says he is not in favor of having a new Official Secrets Act , precisely because the existing provisions are too wide and loose. // He cautions that a much narrower definition , specifying what activities of government should be secret , might be much more dangerous to the press. // As it is , the media in Britain are generally more inhibited than their counterparts in the US in what they can report. // But many Britons do not necessarily feel the American experience is an improvement . Much of the reporting of court cases in the US , for instance , is viewed by newspaper editors here as prejudicial . Also in contrast with the US , laws governing libel are far more stringent in Britain . According to a US diplomat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( in the US ) . It ' s not the case here. ' ' // Nor are the media in Britain , despite their being vigorous and well informed , able to retain quite the same degree of independence as the US media . Much of the US media , on principle , will not accept ' ' junkets ' ' ( expenses-paid trips sponsored by government or commercial organizations ) . The British media are seldom so squeamish . A source in one important British ministry says some British reporters wouldn ' t think of going on a trip unless their expenses were met by the organizers. // At times , too , the British press is charged with doing the government ' s work for it - as a result of the so-called ' ' lobby ' ' system , a source of heated controversy recently . The new Independent newspaper and the Guardian refused to be part of the system , because they feel it compromises their journalistic integrity. // The lobby system // UNDER the lobby system , selected journalists are given off-the-record briefings that enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remaining anonymous . For instance , when the phrase ' ' it is understood ' ' appears in newspapers here in reference to an important government proposal , it almost certainly indicates that the information is from a leading civil service spokesman for the prime minister . Attributed comments from leading government officials are comparatively rare. // The British government defends its system , saying there would be less news and it would be blander if there were only on-the-record briefings . Others sharply criticize the lobby system . Peter Kellner , political correspondent of the New Statesman and frequent commentator on radio , television , and in the ' ' quality ' ' press , likens the system to trading information on the black market , ' ' because the quality is uncertain , it takes place wholly outside the official market , and if it turns out to be bum material , you can ' t take it back. ' ' // For Mr. Kellner there are two distinct dangers of the lobby system . First , he says the information imparted can not be tested in open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenged on what they are doing , while at the same time enabling the government to manipulate information that protects or advances its position . ' ' Removing the system , ' ' he contends , ' ' would force politicians to be more accountable as to what they say and make journalists work harder because under the lobby system material given out is uncheckable. ' ' // The government ' s use of this system is often seen by freedom-of-information proponents as motivated less by a genuine desire to safeguard security than to protect itself from accountability . Critics also charge that excessive secrecy means keeping the public at arm ' s length . Kellner says it means : // ' ' They , and only they , have the skill , and the knowledge , and the right to govern , and the very idea they should share information to the outside world runs counter to the view they alone know how to run the government sensibly and rationally.
