rumors that the hall would be attacked on Armistice Day . But those ex-soldiers marched right past the hall and did n't stop , and it looked like the rumors had been all wrong . " I remember I stood watching them . It was cold and foggy . We felt good that nothing had happened and we stood in the crowd , laughing and having a good time . But on the way back , the parade suddenly stopped in front of the union hall and some of the men broke through the door . I heard shooting . There was a lot of screaming and yelling . My father 's cousin said we had better get out of there and get back to the farm . The next day we found out that Wesley Everest had shot one or two of the men who had followed him as he had run out of the hall and the town and tried to cross a river .

My mother and I stood in the crowd on the pier and watched the ship move slowly away . My father stood on the deck , waving his cane . Gulls circled and screamed overhead . The river looked burnished beneath the late afternoon sun . Along the shoreline the water was frozen and out in the wide clear channel large blocks of ice floated on the surface and glistened in the sunlight . My father grew smaller and smaller . Then I could no longer see him . My mother stood huddled inside her coat , gazing down the river at the receding ship , her eyes wide and moist , her hair long beneath her beret .

I will write very slowly and with care so you will be able to read my terrible handwriting . " We return now to our little bird . He crossed the stormy ocean and suddenly found himself in an even stormier land . All the earth was filled with the storms of war . Our bird flew back and forth across the burning land . And he was astonished to find that wherever he went he heard music . How strange that in the midst of war there was music ! Men marched and fought and killed and sang .

Andp152there in that valley he found a white horse , dead in a field of grass , killed by an exploding shell . What a lovely horse it must have been ! Dead in the grass from the war . It seemed to our bird that all the beautiful things in the world were dying in this war  --  and still the music was going on , giving strength to both sides , soothing the dying and those left to grieve .

The next day he flew over a valley and saw soldiers from the other army enter another village and kill old men , women , and children who were sympathetic to the first side . In the weeks that followed , our little bird saw that happen in many villages and towns . His eyes grew dull , his wings grew weary . How could the source of all the world 's music be in such a land ? Impossible ! And he decided to end his search in the land of blood and bombs and return across the ocean to the land of mountains and rivers and plains and great forests . He thought wearily that the source of the music might well be somewhere in that new land . He would search for it there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea . " That is my story . " How are you , Ilana Davita ?

Does my story have an ending this time ? I am very tired . It is easier to write a story with an ending than to write one without an ending . Is your father well ? Send him my kindest regards . And to you and your mother , my affectionategood wishes , Jakob Daw . " I showed the letter to my mother and watched as she read it . " Is Uncle Jakob coming back to America ? "  | " Yes , " my mother said in a barely audible voice , staring at the letter . " Where will he live ? " " I do n't know . " " Why is Uncle Jakob coming back to America ? " " I do n't know .

Then he cabled us from Madrid . Found Daw . He and Madrid in bad shape . Hip doing nicely . We heard nothing from Jakob Daw . We began to receive mail from my father every two or three days . He told us that he loved us and missed us . He wrote about the weather  --  cold and wet  --  and the activities of some of his fellowjournalists  --  flamboyant , contemptible , noble , cowardly . He himself was being careful . The hip was fine and he had discarded the cane . He sent on gossip about Hemingway and Malraux .

Then he wrote that the weather was turning warm.  |p155I  asked my mother one morning , " Why is Papa writing so much now ? He did n't write us before . " " Sometimes things happen to people and they change , " my mother said . " They do things they did n't do before ? " " Yes . " " Like when I started going to synagogue after I met David and Ruthie ? " She hesitated a moment . " Yes , Ilana . Something like that . " " And like what happened to Papa in Centralia ? " She gave me a sudden sharp look across the breakfast table andsaid in a tight voice , " Your father spoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened by the anger in her eyes . " What did he say ? " I told her . She relaxed a little . " Yes , " she said softly . " Like what happened to your father in Centralia . " " I 'm glad Papa changed and is writing to us , " I said . My mother was changing too . A sadness had settled upon her . Those moments when her eyes turned inward became more frequentand intense . Sometimes she went about the apartment talking to herself in words I did n't understand . One afternoon I went past her bedroom and noticed the door open and peered inside and found her standing at the window that looked out onto the backyard . The soft light of early spring lay upon her lovely features  --  thesmall lips and slightly pointed chin and high cheekbonesand dark eyes and the long startling spill of her raven hair . She stood sharply outlined against the window  --  trim , thinhipped , full-breasted , her head nearly touching the pane . She was speaking softly to the window , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , do n't you . You see through us the same way that we see through you . It 's the loneliness . That 's right . It 's Mama waking to no husband on Shabbos and yom-tov . Yes , that 's right . It 's zaideh alone with us at the table . Yes , yes . It 's the sounds in the darkness during the night , for which I need the strength ofp156my man , and my man is n't here . It 's pogroms that might come at any time . Yes , pogroms . Can anything be worse than this black plague of loneliness ? " She went on talking that way awhile , then began to use words I did n't understand . I moved quietly back from the door and went to my room . Now she worked half-days five days a week as a social worker in an agency in Manhattan and also taught English four nights a week to new immigrants in a nearby night school . She said to me one Saturday afternoon , " Please do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sometimes I get home late from the agency . You 're a big girl . Besides , I 'm a very good social worker and a very good teacher of English , and I like what I 'm doing . That 's right . I had very good teachers in Vienna and in Brooklyn College . I can see you 're upset . There is n't much we can do about it , Ilana . We need the money to live . " On the nights when she was home she would come into my room and sit in the light padded living room chair she had moved near my desk . She would help me with my homework or sit quietly , reading . I had the feeling on those nights that it was less our need for money that drove her to work than it was her dread of being long hours alone . One night in the second week of April I woke trembling and went fearfully through the dark hallway to my parents ' bedroom and climbed into bed next to my mother , who lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disarray over her face and the pillow . I lay against her , trembling , and she stirred and woke and turned her head to me . " What is it , darling ? " Her breath was stale and dry . " A nightmare , Mama . " " Poor darling . Let me hold you . You 're shivering . I 'm here , Ilana . Your mother is here . " She soothed me and I slept inside her warmth . Through my sleep I felt her holding me , stroking my face and hair , whispering against my cheek words in a language I did not understand.  |p157One  Friday my mother remained in Manhattan after work in order to attend a party-sponsored rally in Madison Square Garden . That evening I went out of the apartment and stood for a long moment on the landing outside the door , listening to the song of the door harp . The house sounded eerily silent . I went down the stairs , my capped shoes echoing softly through the hallway . In the air were the distinctive odors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets in Sea Gate . I had on a pale blue light woolen dress with a white collar and long sleeves  --  my best dress . I went to the door of Ruthie 's apartment and rang the bell . Ruthie opened the door . " Hello , Ilana , " she said . " Good Shabbos . You should n't ring the bell on Shabbos . It uses the electricity . Remember ? " " I 'm sorry . " " Come in . I like your dress . Is that for us ? " She wore a white long-sleeved woolen dress which accentuated her red hair and freckled face . " From me and my mother . " " Is it Ilana ? " I heard her mother call from the kitchen . " Yes , Mama . And she brought a present . " " Come in and say hello . My husband will be home soon from shul . " We entered the kitchen , a hot white room thick with the embracingodors of soup and meat . " What a beautiful plant ! " Mrs. Helfman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A pothos . I like the green and white leaves . My husband is a gardener . Did you know that ? " She had on a dark blue long-sleeved dress , over which she wore a white apron . A white kerchief covered her red hair . Her eyes were soft and wide and brown , and her roundish face , flushed by the heat in the kitchen , was smooth and happy-looking . " I like your mother 's taste , Ilana . " She put the plant on the windowsill near the kitchenp158table . " It will get the afternoon sun , " she said . " Ruthie , take Ilana into the living room . " " Ca n't I help with something , Mrs. Helfman ? " " You want to help ? Sure you can help . I 'll tell you what you can do . But first put on an apron . I do n't want you to spoil such a pretty dress . " We made a salad . We brought dishes from the kitchen to the living room , where a console @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and widened and covered with a white cloth . On the buffet stood a polished triple-branched silver candelabrum . White candles , their drip pans still clean , cast soft yellow light and pale shadows throughout the room . The table gleamed with its six settings of dishes and glasses and silverware and silver wine cups . On the wall over the buffet was a dark blue velvet hanging on which was painted in gold a representation of the Old City of Jerusalem . Above the city , in a flaming nimbus from which spokes of golden light radiated in all directions , were Hebrew words which Ruthie had once translated for me : " I believe in perfectfaith in the coming of the Messiah ; and even though he delays , still I believe in him . " There were no other pictures or drawings anywhere in the apartment . On the righthand lintel of each door , at about eye level for adults , was a little box which Ruthie called a mezuzah . There were holy writings inside each box , she said . The box reminded you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mezuzah on the front door had been carried by her father to America after the big war . It was one of the few possessionsleft in his house in a small town in Poland after the pogrom in which his parents and his two sisters had been killed . No one could understand how the mezuzah had survived the pogrom . It was a miracle , Ruthie said . I knew that word : pogrom . Ruthie had explained it to me duringone of the many times we had played together . The organized killing of Jews by a mob . The word frightened me . Pogrom . Like the word war . Ruthie would talk to me often about her parents ' European beginnings . Her father was a descendant of teachers andp159rabbis ; her mother 's father and both grandfathers had been merhants . Ruthie 's parents had been introduced to each other in America ; and Ruthie had been born two days before me . We had laughed with delight when we discovered that coincidence in dates . Often , as I listened to her talk about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother 's life in Europe . She had been born in Poland and educated in Vienna . Her father was a Hasid and on Sabbaths and festivals was often away from home visiting the leader of his sect . She had been raised by her mother and grandfather . Sometimes I wondered what it was like to have your mother 's father acting as your father . It had to be better than having no father at all . The three of us stood around in the kitchen , engaged in warm and idle talk . Mrs. Helfman wanted to know what kind of rally my mother was attending . When I told her , she raised her eyes to the ceiling , shook her head , and sighed . Ruthie wanted to know what a Communist party was like . Mrs. Helfman asked her to take the braided bread called challah into the living room and put it on the table ; the men would be here soon , she said . I asked which men . I had seen the six settings but did not know who else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his son David , " Mrs. Iielfman said . " Take this challah cloth out to the table , Ilana , and give it to Ruthie . She 'll know what to do with it . " I went through the hallway to the living room and handed the white embroidered cloth to Ruthie . I heard a knock on the door . Mrs. Helfman went to open it . For a moment I expected to hear the soft tones of the door harp . I heard instead Shabbos greetings and the voices of Mr. Helfman , David Dinn , and his father as they entered the apartment . I stood in the doorway to the living room , looking down the hallway . They all wore dark coats and suits and dark felt hats . Mr. Hellman , short and portly , was talking in what I thought was Yiddish to Mr. Dinn , whose tall , spare figure seemed to dwarf the presence of his son . David saw me and raised a hand in greeting . Mr. Helfman wasp160putting the coats away in a closet near the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They all came up the hallway into the living room , the men wearing dark skullcaps now . David appeared thinner than usual in a dark suit that seemed a size too large for him . " Good Shabbos , Ruthie , " Mr. Dinn said in his urbane and courtly manner . " Good Shabbos , Ilana . I understand your mother is busy tonight . " As he said this , a faint note of disdain entered his voice . " Well , it 's certainly nice to see you , Ilana . What a lovely dress on such a lovely girl ! Two lovely girls ! We must not forget our Ruthie . What do you hear from your father , Ilana ? " " Papa and Uncle Jakob left Madrid and are going to the north of Spain . " " Uncle Jakob ? " Mrs. Helfman asked . " Mr. Jakob Daw . Mama 's friend . " " Jakob Daw , the writer ? " " Yes . " " Jakob Daw is one of Channah 's friends from her Vienna days , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . She has other friends as well , but we wo n't talk about them . " Again , that tone of disdain entered his voice . He had pronouncedthe first consonant of my mother 's name with a guttural sound on the first letter , like someone clearing his throat . Uncle Jakob called her by that name . Some called her Hannah . My father called her Annie . Most called her Anne . What did it mean when a person was known by many different names ? Channah , Hannah , Annie , Anne . Like my mother calling me Ilana , and my father calling me Davita , and Uncle Jakob almost always calling me Ilana Davita , and Aunt Sarah " Now and then I read your father 's stories on the war , " Mr. Dinn was saying . " He 's a very good writer , when he gives us facts . But he 's not very good when he starts in with the Communist propaganda . Is Jakob Daw also writing about the war ? It seems every writer of importance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How do you know so much about the war ? " Mr. Helfman asked . " I read the papers and magazines . I see refugees in my office . Do n't you read what 's going on ? " " I read . But it does n't interest me . I refuse to fill my head with it . Who cares about goyische wars ? A head has just so much space in it , and if you fill it with junk you have no room for important matters . " We had all taken seats in the living room . Ruthie and her mother sat together on the blue upholstered couch , Mrs. Helfman leaning against the tufted side cushion at her right , her plump fingersplaying idly with the ornament of the curved wooden scrolled arm of the couch . I sat next to Ruthie , who had on her face the blank look she wore when she was bored . Mrs. Helfman listened with interest to the conversation but said little . Mr. Helfmansat in an easy chair across from David and his father . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Dinn was saying . " If Franco wins , Hitler has a green light . " " I do n't believe it for a minute , " Mr. Helfman said . " What green light ? What ? Hitler is a clown and a yold . What will he do ? " " Hitler is not a clown , " Mr. Dinn said quietly . " It would be a dreadful error if we thought he was . " " What can he do ? " Mr. Helfman asked . " You think America and England and France will let him do what he wants ? Not a chance . " " They have been letting him do what he wants for years , " Mr. Dinn said . " That 's why Franco is winning in Spain . That 's why we have the choice we have today : fascism or communism . What a choice ! It 's like choosing between Sedom and Amorrah . " David sat in an easy chair next to his father . From time to time he raised his eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the milky whiteness of his face , and his neck , sticking out of the collar of his too-large shirt , gave him a scrawny , birdlike appearance.  | " I do n't know if Uncle Jakob is still writing about the war , " I said to Mr. Dinn . " Uncle Jakob wrote to us that he 's tired of the war . " " Is he ? " Mr. Dinn said without apparent interest . " He wrote that both sides in the war are terrible and that he wants to come to America . " " Jakob Daw wants to come to America ? " Mrs. Helfman said . Mr. Dinn turned to me . " When is he coming ? " There was a vague tightness in his voice . " He does n't know . My father wrote that the Americans wo n't give him a visa . So they 're going together to Bilbao . That 's a city in the north of Spain . " " Yes , I know where Bilbao is , Ilana . Why are they going to Bilbao @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe Papa wants to help Uncle Jakob get back across the border into France . " There was a brief silence . " Perhaps we should make Kiddush and wash and eat , " Mrs. Helfman said quietly . " Everything is ready . " We moved to the table . Mr. Helfman poured wine from a silver beaker into the silver cups . He and Mr. Dinn had large cups ; the other cups were small . We stood in front of our chairs as Mr. Helfman , holding up his cup , began to chant the prayers in a thin , unmelodious voice . I could make out some of the words ; I had seen them in one of the books Ruthie had given me and in the synagogue prayerbook . " Boruch atuh Adonoi , elohainoo melechhu'olum . . . . " He chanted slowly , and when he was done , everyonesaid , " Amen . " He sat down and drank from his cup . Then he stood again as Mr. Dinn began to chant the same prayer . David stood next to his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . I could see his lips mouthing the words . Mr. Dinn finished . We all said , " Amen , " and sat down in our chairs and drank from our cups . Then we all filed into the kitchen . Ruthie showed me how to wash my hands with the specialtwo-handled beaker . I did n't know the blessing for washingp163one 's hands ; nor did I know the blessing over bread ; but when Mr. Helfman made the blessing and cut the challah , I answered , " Amen . " The challah was warm and light and had a sweet taste . We sat around the table , eating and talking . I had been placed next to Ruthie and across the table from David and his father . Ruthie 's parents sat at opposite ends of the table . The talk among the adults was about the yeshiva and its new principal , a devout young man from England ; about its English and Hebrew teachers and board of directors ; about something called the Akiva Award ; about the run-down condition of some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems . " People do n't have jobs , how can they give to a yeshiva ? " Mr. Helfman said . I did n't understand most of what they were saying . Ruthie sat eating ( quietly , her face a blank . David listened but said nothing . Between the soup and meat courses , Mr. Dinn steered the conversationback to the war in Spain until Mr. Helfman said , " It is against the law to talk of matters that might disturb one 's Shabbos . " Mr. Dinn broke off . We did not talk of Spain again ( luring the meal . Two of the three candles on the buffet sputtered and died . Mr. Helfman asked me what I was studying in public school and began to compare my subjects with those taught in the yeshiva . There was haughtiness in his voice as he went along claimingsuperiority for the yeshiva curriculum . " How are your grades , Ilana ? " Mrs. Helfman asked . " I get nineties and hundreds , " I said . " I 'll bet you do , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " From across the table David was looking at me as if he were seeing me for the first time . On the buffet the guttering flame of the third candle suddenly flared , leaped upward , flickering wildly , and was gone . A thin columnof dark smoke spiraled slowly toward the ceiling . " Ilana , would you like to help me bring in the dishes ? " Mrs. Helfman asked  |p164From  inside the kitchen , which was now cluttered with dirty pots and dishes , I heard David and his father and Mr. Helfman talking together about something I did n't understand . They spoke briefly in English , then slipped into Yiddish . Mr. Dinn and Mr. Helfman went on talking Yiddish , but David kept going from one language to the other . Mrs. Helfman saw me listening and said , " They are discussing tomorrow morning 's sedra  --  the reading from the Torah . " " David knows almost all the Torah by heart , " Ruthie said proudly . " David is a genius . " " Bring in the cake , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brag so much . You 'll bring upon us the evil eye , God forbid . " Later , as we sat around the table near the end of the meal , Mr. Dinn leaned back in his chair , cleared his throat , and proceeded to deliver a little sermon . His forefingers tucked inside his vest pockets , he began in his sonorous voice to describe how God came down to Mount Sinai thousands of years ago in order to give the Torah to the Jewish people . The mountain was all covered in smoke , he said . There was thunder ; lightning flashed from the clouds . The Torah was written in fire on tablets and the tabletswere then wrapped in fire . Moses ' face shone with light as he held them . " Only Moses could touch that sacred fire , " said Mr. Dinn . " And that sacred fire could not be tampered with . The Sanctuary in the desert also had a special sacred fire , and only on that fire was one permitted to offer a bird or an animal as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons of Aaron the high priest brought their own fire into the Sanctuary and were killed . A strange fire must never be brought into the heart of the Sanctuary where the sacred fire of God is found . From this we can learn that we must preserve with care the sacred fire of our Torah , its laws , its words , and never permit it to be mixed with strange fires from the outside . " As he spoke I noticed David and Mr. Helfman and his wife glance at me from time to time as if to gauge my reaction to his words . But I could not understand much of what Mr. Dinn said . Mr. Dinn and Mr. Helfman then talked awhile longer about thep165mysterious deaths of the sons of Aaron . David joined their conversation . Ruthie and Mrs. Helfman sat listening . Then they all began to sing zemiros . There were phrases in the zemiros that I recognized . Mr. Dinn seemed surprised to see me join in the singing . I sat quietly through the many songs I did n't know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated . Sometimes I just sang the melody without the words . Nine months earlier , on a sultry Friday night , I had listened to David and his father joyfully singing these songs on the porch of their house in Sea Gate ; now I was singing with them . I had no idea what the words meant ; I just enjoyed the music , the lilt and rhythm of the melodies , now slow and now fast , now melancholy and now joyous . At a pause in the singing Mr. Dinn leaned forward and placed his long arms on the table and said , " Well , I see you enjoy singing , Ilana . You know , there 's an interesting story told about King David and his harp . " He adopted again that serious and sonorous tone . " King David was a great musician . When he slept his harp hung from the wall over his bed . The winds are strong in Jerusalem . Each night the wind would blow through the strings of the harp and the harp would begin to sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music of his harp , and then spend the rest of the night studying Torah so he could be a strong and wise king . An interesting story . " He smiled down at me in his distant and courtly manner . " Let 's sing some more . " The air in the room grew warm . Mr. Dinn and Mr. Helfman and David removed their jackets and sat in their shirt sleeves , singing . There was color on David 's normally pale face and his eyes were shining . He sang in his high , thin voice , with his eyes closed and his body swaying back and forth . We sang for a long time . Then they sang and chanted the prayers that ended the meal . And when the singing was done , Mr. Dinn and David and Mr. Helfman got into a discussion about a point raised earlier concerning the sons of Aaron . They were deep in this talk a few minutes later when , suddenly , jarringly , the doorbell rang . Mr. Helfman looked up , surprise on his round face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Helfman said , " It must be your mother , Ilana . " Ruthie went to the door . I heard my mother 's voice and her footsteps in the hall . She came into the living room with Ruthie . She looked weary and ashen . Her hair was in disarray beneath her dark beret . She stood blinking her eyes in the brightness of the living room and gazing at the people around the table . " Hello , Ezra , " she said evenly . " How are you ? " " I 'm well , Channah , " Mr. Dinn said , after a pause . " And you ? " " I 'm very tired . " " Your rally went well ? " " Very well . " " You spoke ? " " Yes . " " I 'm glad for you that it went well . " His manner was stiff and polite . There was a brief silence . " David , how are you ? " my mother asked . I saw a slight stiffening of David 's thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some sullenness in his voice . My mother said to Mrs. Helfman , " Thank you for taking care of Ilana . " " A pleasure and a joy , " Mrs. Helfman said . " Anytime , " Mr. Helfman said . " A smart girl , a bright girl . " He said something in a language I did n't understand . My mother smiled wearily . " Channah , " Mr. Dinn said . My mother turned to him . " Call me Monday morning about Jakob Daw 's visa . There are people in Washington I can talk to . " My mother looked at him , then looked at me . " If you want me to , I 'll help , " Mr. Dinn said . My mother nodded slowly , wearily . " Good night , Channah , " Mr. Dinn said . " Good night , Mrs. Chandal , " Mr. Helfman said.  | " Good Shabbos , Ilana , " David said . At the door , Mrs. Helfman said , " You 're sure you do n't want a cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to go to bed , " my mother said . Ruthie said , " Good Shabbos , Ilana . " " Good Shabbos , Ruthie . Maybe I 'll see you in shul in the morning . " " Good night , Mrs. Helfman , Ruthie , " my mother said . We started along the hallway to the stairs . A dull heavy silencebrooded over the house . I could hear the echoes of our footsteps . " Mama ? " " Yes . " " You should n't ring their doorbell on Shabbos . They do n't use electricity . " She paused for the briefest moment on the stairs , then continuedalong beside me . " I 'll try to remember , Ilana . " " Were there lots of people at the rally ? " " Thousands . Many thousands . " " And you gave a speech ? " " Yes . " We were on our landing but not yet at the door , and she was already removing her coat and beret . " Mama , did you go to school with Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time before you were born . " She fumbled in her purse for the key , hampered by her coat , which she had thrown over one arm . As she put the key into the door , she murmured to herself , but clearly enough for me to hear , " I am so tired . . . . Who can get used to this ? After so many years together , to come home alone and go to bed alone and wake up alone .... " The harp sang softly as we entered the apartment . The web of sunlight upon my curtain woke me . I dressed and ate quickly . In a dream during the night I had heard my mother crying . I peered into her room and saw her curled up in sleep ,  |p168looking  frail and small , her mouth slightly open , the morning light giving her smooth face an ivory pallor . I went from the apartment and the house and walked in the cool April morning air to the synagogue . Some days before , I had wandered about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found myself in my parents ' bedroom looking at the bookcase that stood alongside the desk . I discovered an English Bible . I took it along with me . Inside the synagogue , I found my seat near the curtained wall . An old woman helped me find the Torah reading . I read slowly and carefullythe ninth , tenth , and eleventh chapters of Leviticus . The English was very difficult and I did not like the parts about killing a calf and dipping a finger in the blood and pouring the blood on the altar . I wondered if that was how everyone once worshipped God . I was not surprised that my parents did not believe in God or prayer . Blood and altars and burning kidneys and fat ! I read carefully how the sons of Aaron were killed while bringing strange fire before the Lord . A fire went out from the Lord and killed them . I could not understand why they had to be killed for that . I read slowly about the animals the children of Israel were permitted to eat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatures whose names I did n't know : coney , ossifrage , ospray , kite , cormorant , gier eagle , and lapwing . But I knew hare and swine and vulture and owl . I read very carefully and slowly but did n't understand what cloven-footed and cheweth the cud meant . But I understood about creeping things that went about on the belly and had more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth : I thought those words meant anything that had lots of legs . I understood about that . I remembered the roaches and bedbugs in our past apartments and the insects on the screens of the porches in Sea Gate : flying , crawling , whirring , buzzing , tapping . Outside in front of the building after the service I went over to David and wished him a good Shabbos and said I could n't understand why God killed the two sons of Aaron just because theyp169were using strange fire . It seemed a very cruel punishment , I said . David stood among his friends and gazed at me out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring trees of the parkway and fell upon his face , giving his skin a translucent appearance and revealing the veins in his cheeks and along the sides of his head . " They died because they were very bad , " he said . " What did they do ? " " The midrash says they would be marching along behind Moshe and Aharon , and the children of Israel would follow , and all the time the sons of Aharon would keep saying to each other , When are those two old people going to die so we can become the leaders ? ' They had evil hearts . " " Where does it say that ? I did n't see it in my book . " " It 's in the midrash . Those are stories that explain the Torah . " " But why is n't that story in this book ? " " Because it is n't . Not everything  --  " " What kind of book is that ? " one of David 's friends suddenly interrupted . " It 's a Bible book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One of the boys had come alongside me and was peering at the spine of the book . " It 's the King James Bible , " he said in a tone of horror . They all backed away a step or two as if I were holding in my hand a specimen of forbidden vermin . " That 's a goyische Bible , Ilana , " David said . " It 's used by mis-sionaries . " " Did she bring it into shul ? " another boy asked . A rush of heat swept across my face . They stood before me in a tight semicircle , about a half-dozen of them , in dark suits and hats , gazing at me out of dark accusing eyes . I felt myself swiftly judged and instantly impaled upon their cold and demeaning stares . " I 'll get you a different Bible , " David said . " You should n't bring that one to shul . You should n't even read from it . There'sp170my father . Good Shabbos . I 'll give the Bible to Ruthie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the crowd and was gone . I walked quickly home . A letter had arrived from my father . He was in Bilbao with Jakob Daw . Hip okay . Daw okay . Visa not okay . War very definitelynot okay . Over lunch I asked my mother what the word missionary meant . She said it meant a person who was sent by a church to some area to do educational or hospital work and to win followers for the church . " It comes from an old word meaning to send off , " she said . " I took your Bible to shul today and David said it was a Bible for missionaries . " " Missionaries use it , yes . " " He said I should n't bring it to shul anymore . " " I 'm not in the least bit surprised . " " Why do you have such a Bible ? " " It 's a lovely work of English literature , Ilana , I read it for the pleasure I get from its language . " " Is Aunt Sarah a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while in silence . " Are you going to ask Mr. Dinn to help Uncle Jakob get a visa ? " " Yes . " " Is the war very bad in Bilbao ? " " The war is bad everywhere in Spain . " " Can we go for a walk in Prospect Park later ? " " Yes . " " I want to go for a walk and see if there are flowers and watch people rowing on the lake . " " You 'll see tulips and daffodils , Ilana . Those are lovely flowers . " " Mrs. Helfman said that Mr. Helfman plants flowers in the backyard in the spring . "  |p171My  mother said nothing . She seemed abstracted , elsewhere in her thoughts . After a while I said , " David 's friends are pretty nasty , you know ? I do n't like them . " " Boys are nasty sometimes . " " They laugh at me . They 're cruel . " " Men can be like that too sometimes , " my mother said . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Aaron . " " Finish your lunch , Ilana . " " I wish God would send a fire and kill them . " " Ilana ! " " I hate them . " " Please finish your lunch , Ilana . Then you 'll help me clean up and we 'll take our walk . " I did not go back to that synagogue for a long time. t The weather turned warm . There were days of brilliant sunshine and clear blue air . Young birds played in the budding trees outside my window . The sycamore in our backyard took on a soft and lacy look . One Sunday afternoon I saw Mr. Helfman turning over the earth near the far fence of the backyard and planting seeds . I watched him from the window of my parents ' bedroom , a short , pudgy , genial man wearing an old sweater and pants and a dark skullcap . He worked a long time , pausing frequently to wipe his face with a handkerchief . That was the afternoon three strangers  --  twomen and a woman  --  came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room , studying . They looked to be in their middle or late thirties . I stood in the doorway to the living room and listened . They sat in the afternoon sunlight that came through the bay window . Each held a book and each read from it in turn . From time to time they would discuss a passage at length . My mother would respond to their questions in her quiet , determined , authoritative tone . Her face , bathed in sunlight , wore a soft gauzy luminous look . After a while I returned to my room and lay on my bed gazing at the sunlight coming through myp172window and listening to my mother 's voice coming through the wall and thinking of Sea Gate and the sunlight on the beach and wondering where Jakob Daw and my father were . The war was now in the mountains all around Bilbao . After the people had gone I asked my mother who they were . " Friends . " " What were you doing ? " " Studying a work by Karl Marx . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon . " By filling all the hours of her days with work she was removing from her life the hollows of what she called empty time . Empty time led to loneliness , she had once said to me . And sometimes one might do strange and hurtful things out of loneliness . Lonelinesswas to be prevented as one prevents the spread of a plague . The following Sunday afternoon the strangers returned and sat with my mother in our living room , studying Karl Marx . They studied the text sentence by sentence , stopping often to ask questionsof one another and to listen to my mother 's explanations . Sometimes my mother would answer by quoting from the originalGerman . I lay on my bed listening to my mother 's voice through the wall . Four letters had arrived from my father that week . He wrote that Jakob Daw had a visa waiting for him in Lisbon and would soon be leaving Bilbao . Hip fine , war bad , visa large surprise and small miracle . I thought of Jakob Daw and my father in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and legs and the corpses of horses and people and the fires of shells and bombs . War . I spent the rest of the day reading a book Ruthie had given me . It was about an ancient plague that had struck the students of a great rabbi during a revolt of the Jews against the Roman empire . The rabbi 's name was Akiva . Thousands of students died of that plague . Suddenly the plague stopped . This happened about two thousand years ago , the book said , and Jews still celebrated the day the plague began to come to an end . There were color picturesp173of boys and girls picnicking and playing at racing games and with bows and arrows . My mother and I went to the movies that evening and saw a long newsreel on the war in Spain . We watched Madrid being bombed and the fighting in the hills around Bilbao . There were fiery explosions and huge columns of boiling black smoke and collapsing buildings and men lying dead in tall grass beside a swiftly flowing river . I became ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed my nightgown and my sheets and held me and sang me to sleep with a lullaby in Yiddish . I was running a high fever and later in the night had a dream . There was a sudden rustling noise and I looked and Baba Yaga was in the sycamore tree outside my window , peering at me through the branches , green-visaged , monstrous . A shock of terror pierced me . I found you , dear child , she said . Now you will go with Baba Yaga . Abruptly she sprang from the tree through my window and stood at the foot of my bed , laughing hideously , her mouth huge and black , her eyes red and burning . I was paralyzed with terror and could not scream . I felt myself wanting to scream , tried to push the scream from my throat , but my throat was tight , nothing would come from it . She moved toward me , a vile stench rising from her . How loathsome and grotesque she was ! She stood beside me and reached out . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an image of dead things floating in the green scum of a river 's edge . I screamed and woke . My mother was immediately in my room . I cried and shivered . She held me and remained with me until I fell back asleep . In the morning the fever was gone but I lay shivering and my mother stayed with me all that day , nursing me as Aunt Sarah had once nursed her and my father . That night my temperature was still normal , and the next morning I returned to school . I felt weak all that day . The weather was alternately cloudy and sunny , the air suddenly cold each time clouds slid across the sun . The cold prickled my skin and I would find myself shivering . On the way home from school I went past the yeshiva but saw no onep174I knew in the front yard . My mother was at her work in Manhattan . I let myself into the apartment and stood near the door a moment , listening to the harp . In the kitchen I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandered listlessly through the rooms and hallway . From the window in the spare bedroom I saw cats playing among the garbage cans in the cellarway . I thought of Aunt Sarah and wondered where she was . Had she come back from Spain ? What did she do in her work as a missionary : nurse sick people to health and ask them to believe in Jesus Christ ? Did she ask them to get down on their knees with her ? I remembered myself on my knees in this room . It seemed an awkward position for prayer  --  and yet strangely comforting in a way I could not understand . On your knees with your hands together . I felt myself sliding to my knees and raising my hands . I knelt at the window a foot or so from the bed in which Aunt Sarah had slept . I did n't know what to say or to whom to say it . Finally I said , " Please protect my father and my Uncle Jakob . Please . Please . My name is Ilana Davita Chandal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I got to my feet , feeling cold . The apartment was warm but my feet and the tips of my fingers were icy . I went out of the spare bedroom and walked slowly through the hallway to my parents ' bedroom . From the window I saw that someone had suspended a bird feeder from a branch of the sycamore . Birds perched on the feeder and fluttered about it , pecking at the seeds . It seemed far enough away from the branch to prevent a cat from getting at the birds . The earth of the garden bed lay scraped and naked to the sky . In the east the sky had begun to empty of color . I walked back slowly through the dim hallway . Entering my room , I heard , echoing through the silence that lay heavily upon the house , the clear loud click of the lock on the downstairs hallway door . Someonewas quickly climbing the stairs . I went to the door and opened it and saw Mr. Dinn come onto our landing . He wore a dark spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat , and he carried in his hand a copy of The New York Times . He seemed startled by my appearance at the door.  | " Hello , Ilana . Is your mother home ? " I stared at him and said my mother was in Manhattan and would be home soon . " I was on my way back from the office and thought your mother might be home , " he said , trying to make it sound light and matter-of-fact . Then he said , " How are you feeling ? Are you over your fever ? " I told him I was feeling fine , and wondered who had told him I had been ill . " Please tell your mother I was here , " he said . " Ask her to call me . " I watched him start back down the stairs , a tall thin man , walkingstraight and stiff , and had a sudden image of the way my fatherused to sit slouched against the back of a chair with one foot draped across its arm . At the foot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Helfman apartment . I heard him knock , heard the door open , heard Mrs. Helfman 's voice . I went back into the apartment . The wooden balls of the door harp pinged softly upon the taut wires . A while later , from the window of my room , I saw my mother walking up the street . What a sweet and lovely sensation that was each time , watching my mother moving toward the house and towardme ! I heard the lock click shut . I waited but did not hear my mother 's footsteps . I waited a while longer and went to the door and opened it . I heard my mother and Mrs. Helfman talking togetherquietly in the downstairs hallway . Then my mother started up the stairs . I came out onto the landing and she saw me . She looked very pale . " Mama , Mr. Dinn was here and asked you to call him . " " I know , darling . Mrs. Helfman told me . " " What 's the matter , Mama ? " " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very bad bombing near Bilbao yesterday and Mr. Dinn wanted to know if your father was all right . " She removed her light coat and her beret and placed them in the closet.  | " Is Papa all right ? " " If anything had happened , the paper would have called us . I 'll phone Mr. Dinn . Then I 'll make us something to eat . I 'm sorry I 'm so late today . The office was jammed . I have to go out later and teach my English class . I 'll call the paper in the morning . Come inside the kitchen , Ilana , and help me with supper . First , let me call Mr. Dinn . " Her voice sounded strange . I watched her go along the hallway to the telephone on the stand between the kitchen and her bedroom . During supper we heard a radio news broadcast about a bombingraid by rebel aircraft against a small unprotected town in northern Spain . " Fascist barbarians , " my mother said venomously . " Like the Cossacks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember to tell you . I 'm not a child . " " He was being very kind , Ilana . He wanted to make sure . " " He does n't trust me because I 'm a girl . David is the same way . They think I have no brains . " " It 's very difficult for me to imagine anyone thinking that you have no brains . What 's troubling you , Ilana ? " " I 'm afraid about Papa , " I said , after a pause . " I 'm sure your father is fine , " my mother said . " He 's taking good care of himself these days . Will you do the dishes , please ? I must run to my class . " I cleaned up the kitchen and turned off the light . The apartment was dim and still , deep shadows hovering in the hallway and in the corners near the door . I wandered into my parents ' bedroom and stood near my father 's desk . Suddenly I had a sharp image of him sitting there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale blue eyes , ruddy complexion , a genial man working for a better world for everyone . Why did he run around so much ? Why did my parents care so much ? No one else 's parents seemed to care much about the world . Mr. and Mrs. Helfmanp177did n't seem to care about the world ; nor did the students in my public school class and their parents . Mr. Dinn cared a little about the world ; he helped people who were in trouble over immigrationlaws . But most people had jobs and came home at night and played with their children . How could a single event like what happened in Centralia change a person so much ? And what had hanged my mother from an observant Jew to a Communist ? I could not imagine events that would so change an individual . The image of my father faded and was gone . I went to my room , undressed , and got into bed . I fell asleep reading the book about Rabbi Akiva and his students and the plague and the revolt against Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and come J quietly over to my bed . I did n't know who it was and found I ' could not wake . I sensed the warmth of someone standing next to me and heard soft slow breathing . Then I felt a warm , moist kiss on my cheek , felt the dark sadness of the silent presence that was leaning over me , felt it clearly through my sleep but was still unable to wake . Then strange and musical words were said but I , could not understand what they meant . Then whoever it was drew away from me and stood silent for a long moment and turned and went softly from my room . Later my mother entered my room . She kissed my forehead , her lips cool and dry , and turned off my light and went out . I woke suddenly into the darkness and heard my room filled with whispers . I listened to distant talk and through the haze of dread and half-sleep thought I recognized the voice of Mr. Dinn . The harp sounded softly . I dropped back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother of my dream . " I also dreamt of your father last night , " she said . " It is n't unusualfor that to happen . " She looked down into her coffee cup as she spoke . She seemed not to have slept . She had on her pink housecoat . Her eyes were red and puffy , her long hair uncombed.  | " Was Mr. Dinn here ? " " Yes . He came to tell me about Jakob Daw 's visa . " " When will Uncle Jakob come ? " " I do n't know . But when he does come he 'll have trouble re-maining . " " Why ? " " There are people in Washington who do n't like his politics . " " I do n't understand . " " It means there are powerful people in the government who wo n't let him remain in America more than a few months because they think he 's a threat to the country . " " Where will he go ? " " I have no idea , Ilana . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm so tired , " she said , quietly but clearly . " Why do n't they leave us alone ? " " Do we know where Papa is ? " " I called the newspaper . As far as they know your father is still in Bilbao . I think you should get yourself ready for school . I do n't want you to be late . Go ahead , darling . I 'll clean up the dishes . It will give me something to do . " On my way to school that morning I went by the candy store and saw the headlines . With some of the money my mother gave me for candy I bought a copy of The New York Times . Crossing a street against the light , I was almost hit by a car . Sitting in the classroom and listening to the droning voice of the teacher , I kept looking down at the newspaper on my lap . During recess , I went off to a corner of the yard and stood alone , reading . A boy ran past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snickered . I glanced up for a moment and noticed my teacher , a graying middle-aged woman , standing with another teacher a few yards away near the schoolyard fence . They were both watching me . The yard was filled with the high happy sounds of playing children . I envied them and wished I could be like them . Playing inp179the warm dusty late morning sunlight unaware of the dark world beyond the school and the neighborhood and the city and the country and the ocean . ( Unaware of Franco and Hitler and Mussolini . Unaware of Spain and Madrid and Bilbao . Unaware of the destructionby airplanes of the little town of Guernica a few miles from Bilbao where my father and Jakob Daw now were . Unawareof the headline that read HISTORIC BASQUE TOWN WIPED OUT ; REBEL FLIERS MACHINE-GUN CIVILIANS . Unaware of the story beneath the headline : " BILBAO , Spain , April 27. - Fire was completingtoday the destruction of Guernica , ancient town of the Masques and center of their cultural tradition , which was begun last evening by a terrible onslaught of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this open city far behind the lines occupied precisely three and one-quarter hours ... . At 2 A.M. today , when the writer visited the town , the whole of it was a horrible sight , flaming from end to end . The reflection of the flames could be seen in the clouds of smoke above the mountainsten miles away . Throughout the night houses were falling , until the streets were long heaps of red , impenetrable ruins . " I looked beneath the lower headline and saw the writer was someonecalled G. L. Steer . I wondered if my father had written about the bombing . My mother always brought home the paper for which he wrote ; the candy store in our neighborhood did not carry it . I opened the newspaper and looked inside for the continuation of the story . The pages flapped in the cool April wind . The writer described the survivors who had fled from Guernica to Bilbao " in antique , solid-wheeled Basque farm carts drawn by oxen . The carts , piled high with such household possessions as could be saved from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did n't know what the word conflagration meant but thought it might have to do with destruction and fire . " Other survivors were evacuated in government trucks , but many were forced to remain round the burning town , lying on mattresses or searching for lost children or other relatives . " A whistle signaled the end of the recess . I skipped down to thep180next paragraph . " The object of the bombardment seemingly was the demoralization of the civil population and destruction of the cradle of the Basque race . This appreciation is borne out by the facts , beginning with the day when the deed was done . Yesterday was the customary Monday market day in Guernica for the surroundingcountryside . At 4:30 P.M. when the market was full and peasants were still coming in , church bells rang an alarm for approachingairplanes .... " I looked up . The yard was empty . I ran to my class and was late . I slid into my seat beneath the withering look of my teacher and amidst the grins and whispers of my classmates. es @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gossip , of dresses and parties , and not of airplanes , bombs , and Bilbao , and my father and Jakob Daw somewhere near the fires of Guernica . The apartment was empty when I returned home . I sat in the kitchen and went on reading the newspaper . " The whole town of 7,000 inhabitants plus 3,000 refugees was slowly and systematicallypounded to pieces . For a radius of five miles around , the raiders bombed separate easerios , or farmhouses . In the night these burned like little candles in the hills . It is impossible to state the total number of victims .... " I heard my mother come in the door . She had a copy of the newspaper for which my father wrote and there was a story in it by my father about the fighting around Bilbao . The story had been written the day of the bombing of Guernica . The paper also carried a story about Guernica that had not been written by my father . " Mama , did you call the newspaper again ? " She had called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . They assumed he was in Bilbao and were expecting additional stories by him from there . Late that night I woke and heard my mother singing in the livingroom in a low haunting voice that chilled me . What strange music came from her , what soft yet piercing tones , a subdued rise and fall of minor-key melodies and wordless songs that held mep181frozen to my bed . Then she stopped and began to talk in a languagethat sounded like Yiddish . And suddenly an image of Jakob Daw 's little black bird flew across my mind . I saw it clearly , flying and circling , searching for the source of the music of the world . And I asked myself What would the bird do if he ever discovered that source ? Would he swoop down and bomb it ? The next day after school I walked quickly beneath the spring trees along Eastern Parkway on my way home . The air was golden with sunlight , but I felt chilled . Passing the yeshiva , I saw a crowd of children in the open area in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed a festive crowd . The double door of the building was wide open and children kept streaming in and out , some carrying pieces of cake . I started to walk on , then stopped again . David Dinn had just emerged from the building with some of his friends , all with cake in their hands . I stood on the sidewalk near the curb , watching them talking and eating . Then I saw David look past his friends and notice me . He said something to his friends and came quickly toward me . " Have you heard anything about your father ? " " No . " " That was a terrible bombing . " " Did you see the newspapers ? " " My father told me about it . " " Is today a holiday ? " " It 's Lag Ba'omer . The day the plague stopped . Do you know the story about Rabbi Akiva and his students and the plague ? " " Yes . The revolt against Rome . Is it very cold ? " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy sweater . " He gave me a look of concern . " Do you want me to walk you home ? " " Two nights ago I dreamed my father came into my room and kissed me . Do you ever have dreams like that about your mother ? " A shadow passed over his pale face . He did not answer.  | " David ? " " Sometimes , " he said in a low voice , and glanced quickly around . " Look , let me tell my friends I 'm walking you home . " He went over to his friends . I saw them staring at me . The wind blew cruelly . The newspaper , folded and tucked under my arm , seemed strangely burdensome . David Dinn came back to where I stood . " I 'm very cold , " I said . " Come on , " he said . We walked together along the parkway . " Your father came over to my house the other day . " " I know . " " Your father helped my Uncle Jakob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything about what my father does . " t " I know what my father does . " David did not respond . He walked bent forward , a little stooped . We left the parkway and turned into the side street . " Do you want some of this cake ? " he asked . " No , thanks . I 'm very cold . Could I borrow your jacket ? " " It 's a man 's jacket , " he said , hesitating . " I 'm very cold , David . " " You 're not  --  " He broke off and slipped the jacket from histhin body and draped it over my shoulders . " Let me carry that foryou , " he said , and took the Times from under my arm . " Do you celebrate Lag Ba'omer every year ? " I asked . " Yes . " " And it happened two thousand years ago ? " " That 's right . " " I wonder if anyone will remember Guernica that long . " " Jews would remember if it happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your school ? " " All kinds of subjects . " " There 's my house . Thanks for your jacket . " One of our neighbors , a gaunt old woman with rheumy eyes and a lame leg , stood on the top step of her front stoop and regardedus curiously.  | " David , do you still say Kaddish for your mother ? " " Sure . " " Every day ? " " Yes . " " Thanks for walking me home . " " Ilana , will your parents be going back to Sea Gate this sum-mer ? " " I do n't know . " He stood there a moment , looking down at the sidewalk . I had the feeling he was reluctant to leave . " I 'm very cold , " I said . " I 'd better go up . " He watched me climb the stone stairs and go inside . The lock clicked shut behind me . I went up to the apartment . My mother was in the kitchen . She sat at the table , her head in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her beret . She looked up at me as I came inside . " Rana , " she said . " I just got home a few minutes ago . Sit down . I have to tell you something . " She stopped . " Ilana , " she said again . Her voice broke . " Mama ? " " Are you cold ? Why do n't you take off your sweater ? " " Is Papa dead ? " I asked . She stared at me . The blood left her face . " Mama ? " " No , darling . Of course not . Your father is not dead . But no one seems to know where he is . " A cold hand seized my heart . " Was Papa in Guernica ? " " Yes . But no one knows how long or even if he was there duringthe raid . " " Mama  --  " " We will be very brave , Ilana . We will not act like hysterical women . We will be brave and calm . Wo n't we ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mama . " " He could not have been so foolish as to go into such a bombardment . Not my Michael . Oh , no . " She stopped and blinkedp184her eyes a number of times . Then she noticed her arms . " Look at me , darling . I 'm still wearing my coat . How silly ! Let me hang it up and I 'll make us supper . It will be all right . We must n't worry . Will you help me make supper ? Do n't cry , Ilana . You promised me you would n't cry . Please , Ilana . Please . " My father had disappeared . The headlines in his newspaper read OUR CORRESPONDENT PRESUMEDLOST IN GUERNICA RAID . Guernica lay in a valley about fifteenmiles east of Bilbao . Correspondents in the Bilbao hotel where my father had been staying remembered having seen him leave with a car and a driver about two hours before the raid had begun . He was doing a background story on Basque culture and needed to find in Guernica a six-hundred-year-old tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left Bilbao a few days before and was presumed to be on his way to Lisbon for his visa and steamship ticket to the United States . April moved slowly into May . My room was very cold . In the nights I woke crying and shivering . I wet my bed and lay curled into a tight ball . There was comfort in that position . My mother changed my sheets and held me and stroked my face and hair . She went stiffly about her work , her face controlled and without expression . I did not once see her cry . People began to visit us . They came in the evenings and on weekends and stayed for hours . Many of them I recognized from the meetings with which I had grown up in our previous apartments . They chucked me under the chin , remarked how grown up and brave I was , told me I was beautiful , and warned me to be careful of the sons of bosses and capitalists . Some were strangers to me , quiet men and women who seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deferential in the presence of my mother . The two men and the woman who studied the works of Karl Marx with my mother came one evening and stayed for more than an hour . From time to time Mrs. Helfman would suddenlyp185appear at our door with a pot of soup or meat , which she would transfer to my mother 's pots and dishes before quietly leaving . The door harp sang incessantly . In my school only a few seemed aware of my father 's disappearance . A pimply-faced boy came over to me in the yard during recessone afternoon and said , " Your old man was a Commie , serves him right he 's dead . " I turned and walked away from him . My teacher took me aside and said to me , " Is there any way we can help you , dear ? If there is , be sure to let us know . " I found I had nothing to say to her . Sometimes Ruthie would come up and invite me down to play with her . Often I stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruthie 's father tending the flowers in the backyard . On occasion Mr. Dinn would appear in the apartment . He and my mother spent long periods of time talking together in the kitchen or living room . On the Saturday of the first week in May , David walked me part of the way home from the synagogue . He was pale and solemnand for a while could find nothing to say . Then , in a thin and hesitant voice , he said that he did n't know what to say , it was reminding him of last year when his mother had died and the world felt black and cold and he did n't want to get up in the mornings . " But I got up anyway , " he said . " I had to get up . I had to say Kaddish . " People continued to come and go . Slowly I began to find unendurablethe endless music of the door harp . Pinging each time the door opened . Pinging each time the door closed . The harp grated against my ears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I taped the wooden balls to the wires with strips of adhesive and the harp fell mute . My mother said nothing to me about that . Early in the second week of May my mother traveled to Manhattanto talk to some of the people on the paper for which my father worked . She was told that someone had news about my father : an American writer for the Hearst chain who had knownp186him in Bilbao and had just returned to the States . Briefly they recountedhis story and then said that he wanted to talk privately with my mother . One night that week a tall , heavily built man with a dark mustacheand a thin voice came to our apartment . He had dark straight hair and wore steel-rimmed spectacles and a rumpled tweed jacket and light-colored creased trousers . We sat in our livingroom . My mother brought him a Scotch-and-water . He held the glass , peered at it , sipped from it , and began to talk . He spoke a bit hesitantly and with an accent I had heard before only in movies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about now , the man said , and had decided he would come see us rather than write . A priest he knew had been to see him in Bilbao , he said . This priest had heard a strange story from another priest , a Basque , who had survived the air raid on Guernica . The planes had used carefully planned tactics , the man said . He sipped from his glass . His voice became cool and clinical . First , small groups of aircraft had appeared and randomly dropped heavy bombs and hand grenades all over the town . They proceeded from one section of the town to the next in an orderly manner . Some of the bombs made holes twenty to thirty feet deep and drove the people out of their dugouts and shelters . Immediately after those planes came wave after wave of fighter aircraft , swooping very low and machine-gunningthe people who had run from the shelters . This drove the people back into the shelters . Then came another wave of bombers that dropped heavy bombs and incendiaries on the shelters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Clever bastards , " the man said . " Very methodical . Made military history . Opens up a new chapter in the annals of war . Could I trouble you for another drink , Mrs. Chandal ? " My mother took his glass and went from the living room . He sat looking at me through his steel-rimmed spectacles . " How old are you , little girl ? " I told him . " What 's your name ? "  | " Ilana Davita Chandal . " " You got any brothers or sisters ? " " I had a little brother once but he died . " He looked at me and was silent . My mother returned with his drink . He resumed his story . A young Basque priest had been driving to the railroad station in the center of Guernica when the first bombs fell near the MundacaRiver . He saw one of the bombs knock down the front of a four-story hotel not far from the station . Women and children had been standing around in front of the building and when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heads . He ran toward the station to help . More bombs fell in the distance . The man paused . " You sure you want the little girl to hear this ? " " I want her to hear everything , " my mother said . " All right , " the man said , and took another sip from the glass . Then he went on . As the priest was running toward the station , the man said , a car suddenly appeared out of a swirl of dust , and a tall , brownhairedman jumped out . Two aircraft swooped down and began a strafing run . The priest turned and raced toward the river and found concealment under a paved bridge that rested on metal beams and cement pillars . Machine-gun bullets struck the car in which the brown-haired man had ridden , and it exploded . The man was knocked to the ground . He scrambled to his feet and began to run toward the river and the bridge . In front of him a nun was hit in the strafing run and fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on running for the bridge . Behind him came a wave of bombers . He would have made it but his right leg suddenly seemed to collapse under him and he fell near the bank of the river . The priest started toward them when the first bombs fell , knocking him backward into the ankle-deep water at the river 's edge . He saw the man and the nun disappear in the explosion . When the earth settled , there was nothing except  --   |p188The  man stopped , glanced briefly at me , and sipped from his glass . " There was nothing , " he said . A long silence went by . I looked at my mother . Her face was composed . Around my heart the icy hand squeezed until I thought I would cry out . I sat very still . The man went on . It was only a long time afterward , when the driver , who had jumped before the car exploded , began making inquiries about a brown-haired journalist , that the priest realized the man had been an American correspondent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Carmelite convent outside Guernica and had no way of locating the driver . He informed his superior , who in turn told a number of officials as well as the Hearst correspondent in Bilbao , whom he had befriended some months before during a particularly bad night of shelling in Madrid . " There 's no certainty , you understand , " the man said . " There was chaos that day . The priest could be mistaken . " " He is not mistaken , " my mother said in her firm and quiet voice . " How do you know ? " She told him about the wounded right hip . There was a brief silence . " I see what you mean , " the man said . " Yeah . Real sorry . " There was another silence . The man finished his drink and put the glass down on the coffeetable near the pile of copies of the newspaper for which my fatherhad written . He looked first at me , then at my mother . " Anything I can do ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to come , " said my mother . " No trouble , " said the man , getting to his feet . My mother walked with him to the door . When he was gone my mother returned to the living room and sat down on the sofa . She sat stiffly and kept her knees tightly together . Her eyes were black , burning . " Michael ? " she said in a strange small voice . " Michael ? "  |p189I  felt the cold around my heart and now also on the nape of my neck and went quickly downstairs for Mrs. Helfman . To my astonishment , Mr. Dinn appeared at our door almost immediately after Mrs. Helfman came in . My mother did not cry . She sat on the sofa and kept calling my father 's name . I lay in my bed in the darkness and did not cry , either . The room was very cold . The next day my mother went out before breakfast and returned with the morning papers . One was the newspaper for which my father had worked ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My father 's picture was on the front page . Wavy hair , eyes full of light , jaunty smile . My mother and I sat at the kitchen table , staring at my father 's picture . The headline read , in large letters , MICHAEL CHANDAL KILLED IN GUERNICA RAID . Beneath that , in smaller letters , I read , NOTED CORRESPONDENT DIES ATTEMPTING RESCUE OF WOUNDED NUN . The story described my father as a well-known journalist devoted to workers ' causes , as a loyal comrade and a tireless worker . It mentioned his family origins  --  " New England stock , aristocrats , heads of a timber empire against whom Chandal had rebelledin his early years . " It talked of his writings , his travels , his journalistic style , his high reputation . Then it told how he had died  --  and it was the same story the man had told us the night before . My mother turned the pages of The New York Times . Again there was my father 's picture and a headline : JOURNALIST MICHAEL CHANDAL , 36 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked . My mother corrected my pronunciation and explained the word . The article described my father 's New England origins . It said his family had pioneered the lumber industry in the United States . It mentioned the brother who had died in the last war and the change that had come over my father as a result of certain events he had witnessed during and after a riot against Wobblies on Ar/mistice Day , 1919 , in Centralia , Washington  --  " events described in Nineteen-Nineteen , the novel by John Dos Passos , " the article added . It told of my father 's journalistic career , his known association with Communists and Socialists , his " lean , nonrhetorical style , " and the " possible permanent value of what Mr. Chandal used to refer to as his special writing . ' " The article closed with the statement that Mr. Chandal left behind , in his immediate family , a wife and daughter , as well as parents and a sister . And it announced the time , date , and place of a memorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , writing about Centralia , used the words " grisly events . " Once again the apartment filled with visitors . And once again Mr. Dinn appeared one night after I was supposed to be asleep and spent a long time in the kitchen , talking with my mother . A few days later my mother and I took the subway into Manhattan . She wore a dark dress and a dark beret . She sat very straight and still in the train , gazing out the window into the tunnel through which we sped . Her lovely face was set in an expressionlessivory mask ; her eyes were dark , shining . I had yet to see her cry over the death of my father . There was about her now a quality of grace , a regal poise ; suffering seemed to have added to her reservoir of courage . We came out of the subway and walked along a crowded downtown street in a warm rain . We turned a corner and entered a hotel and climbed a wide carpeted staircase to a carpeted hallway and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room were of imitation marble and on the ceiling pink cherubs and bosomy maidens frolicked amidst flowers along the banks of a blue and misty river . The room was filled with chairs and crowded with people . Heads turned as my mother and I entered the room . We walked through a sea of stares toward the stage . A man I had never seen before came toward us . He was of mediumheight , his head entirely bald , and he wore a dark brush mustache . He greeted my mother deferentially , nodded briefly at me , and led us onto the stage . My hands and feet and heart werep191cold . All around us on the stage people were shaking my mother 's hand . I felt entombed by the darkness of their suits and dresses . And all the faces in the enormous room beyond the stage : silent now , raised , solemn , expectant . A man stood and began to talk in a low voice about my father . The sound system sent his words back to the stage in a softly reverberatingecho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chandal the journalist , Michael Chandal the writer , Michael Chandal the hero . My mother sat very straight , gazing fixedly at the speaker 's back , her head raised and her hands in her7 lap . The speaker finished and there was a burst of applause . The speaker turned and started back to his seat . As he crossed the stage , I saw him glance furtively at my mother , as if seeking her approval for his words , and I saw my mother give him a single nod . He smiled faintly and slid into his seat and took out a handkerchief and wiped his face . There were many speeches about my father that afternoon . There were speeches too about the party , about the menace of fascism , about the cause  --  causa , the speaker called it  --  about the gloriousachievements of the Soviet Union . Someone quoted a poet who had been to Russia and had said , upon his return , " I have seen the future and it works . " That received long and loud applause . Someone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Men may die , but let them die in a working class cause . Men die and mean to die ( if necessary ) so that the revolutionmay live on . They may stop us today , but tomorrow we still take up the march . " Again loud and long applause . Then a heavy silence moved swiftly through the crowd . The bald-headed man had risen and was now approaching the podium . He stood for a moment and looked out across the room , bathing in its silence . Then , in a tone that seemed to require no loudness to assert its authority , he began to introduce my mother . He talked of her dedication to the party , her skillful writing , her brilliantteaching , her remarkable courage . His quiet amplified voice seemed to push against the walls of the room . Then he was donep192and he returned to his seat . There was respectful , subdued applause . I watched my mother rise and walk to the podium . Slowly and in a firm voice she thanked the people for coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . She told about how she and my father had met in the twenties , how he had convinced her of the rightness of his views , how they had supported one another 's work for the party , how they had raised a child together , sacrificed together . Her voice quavered and she stopped for a moment . I looked around the room . All the crowd was rigid with silence . Overhead the happy cherubs and maidens played along the banks of their misty blue river , and along the walls strange birds and animals conjured up from some mythic bestiary gazed at the crowd from tall leafy trees and a lush green meadow . I looked up at the ceiling and thought about joining the cherubs in their play . What would it take ? Only a small leap . That 's all . A small leap  --  and then the blue river and the cool water and the careless frolicking with the plump pink maidens . Then my mother said , loudly , in a voice I had never heard her use before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself go cold , " In the name of my late husband , Michael Chandal , I pledge to you that I will continue to work for the party . I will continue to work for a better world . I will continue to work for a classless society and for the dream of Karl Marx . Long live the revolution ! " There was tumultuous applause . My mother returned to her chair . I looked up at her . Her eyes shone ; a thin sheen of perspirationcovered her flushed cheeks and forehead . Her face was expressionless . The bald man shook her hand . The applause continued a long time . Then the crowd burst into song . All stood at attention , singing . Afterward we came down off the stage and people pressed densely around us . I thought I saw the tall , dark-suited figure of Mr. Dinn in the crowd . A woman moved across my field of vision . When I looked again he was gone.  |p193Someone  took us home in a car . I remember a dark river and a tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clung to my mother and smelled her warmth and the sweat on her face and neck . I fell asleep and woke later in my bed in the darkness of my room and heard the voices of my mother and Mr. Dinn . The room was cold . My bed was wet . A chill wind blew through the leafy branches outside my window . In the cellarway a cat wailed . I said to my mother during breakfast the next morning , " What do you and Mr. Dinn talk about at night ? " She gazed at me wearily . " Do n't you ever sleep , Ilana ? " " Do you talk about Uncle Jakob ? " " Yes . And other matters . " " Why did Papa die ? " " Why ? I do n't know . He just did , that 's all . " " Like my little brother ? " " Yes , " she said , after a brief pause . " Like your little brother . " " I hate it when there 's no reason that people die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do you mean ? " " Will there be another memorial service ? " " No . " " Nothing else ? " " What else do you want , Ilana ? " I did n't know what to say and was quiet . " Go get yourself ready for school , " she said . " I do n't want you to be late . " I left her in the kitchen , looking down into her cup of coffee , and went to the bookcase in my parents ' bedroom and carefully searched the shelves . There was another bookcase in the living room and I looked through that one too . The book I wanted was not in my parents ' library . I was late getting out of the house and ran most of the way to school and came late to class . My teacher said nothing . My classmatestried to avoid looking at me . During the morning recess I went into the school library andp194quickly scanned some shelves . After school I walked along Eastern Parkway and went into a large stone-and-glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awhile on line and then asked the librarian for a certain book . She had white hair and metal-rimmed spectacles and gazed at me piercingly from across her desk . " Who is the book for ? " I told her the book was for me . " That is n't a book for a little girl . It 's in the adult division . " I went home . The next day after school I crossed Eastern Parkway very carefully , with the help of the lights , and walked some blocks to a bookstore . Inside I asked an old man with a lined face and a white mustache and heavy-lidded eyes if he could show me where to find a certain book . " Why ? " I hesitated , my heart pounding . " To buy it . " " Who for ? " " My mother , " I said . He went over to some shelves and pulled down a book . Then he told me what it would cost . I told him I did n't have enough money . He put the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , " he said . The next afternoon I walked again down Eastern Parkway and turned into the library . I climbed the staircase to the adult division , went through wide glass-and-wood doors , and found myself in a vast hushed tall-ceilinged marble-floored room . Sunlight streamed through enormous vaulted windows onto long polished wooden tables and tall dark-wood bookcases . There were few peopleat the tables . I stood frozen for a long moment , awed by the silence and the light . It seemed a room without shadows , its furniture and books and reading lamps and catalogues starkly outlinedby the brilliant sun . I stood very still . Coursing through me was the gently electric attraction of the books . I looked cautiouslyp195around . The librarians were busy at their desks . I slipped easily past their gaze . I entered the maze of bookcases . So many books ! So many more stories than in the children 's section below ! I did not know what to do . Standing nearby , searching for a book , was an elderly man in thick glasses , baggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might find Nineteen-Nineteen by Dos Passos . " Hah ? " he said , staring at me . I repeated the question . " I do n't know that book , " he said . " Why do n't you ask one of the librarians ? " I said nothing . " Who did you say is the author ? " " John Dos Passos . " " Try under P , " he said . " Wait . Dos Passos ? Try under D. Maybe you 'll find it under D. " I told him I could n't find the D 's . He told me where to look . I found Dos Passos . I did not find the book . I went out of the library and walked quickly home . I returned the following day . The book was not there . Nor was it there the day after . The next day was Friday . I walked in a drizzle to the library and climbed the marble staircase and went past the long counter behindwhich sat the librarians , working at their desks . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the book . I took it from the shelf and held it and had no notion how to find what I was looking for . I began to turn pages and found a page marked contents . It contained a list of names and something called Newsreel and The Camera Eye . I kept turning the pages and looking at the names . I found nothing about a place called Centralia . I went through the contents page again . The third name from the end was Paul Bunyan . I turned the pages and saw what I thought were newspaper headlines : BAGS 28 HUNS SINGLEHANDEDp196and GANG LEADER SLAIN IN STREET and REDS WEAKENING WASHINGTONHEARS . I could n't understand why there were headlines in a book of stories . Was the book about true stories and made-up stories ? How would I know the difference between them ? I found the page I was looking for and saw in large letters PAUL BUNYAN . I began to read . " When Wesley Everest came home from overseas and got his discharge from the army he went back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly . There were many words I did not understand . " In the army Everest was a sharpshooter , won a medal for a crack shot . " Some of the words were very long and seemed made up of two or more words . I could n't understand why a writer would put words together like that . I read , " Wesley Everest was a logger like Paul Bunyan . " I read about the Wobblies and the timber owners and Memorial Day , 1918 , in Centralia and the way a group called the American Legion wrecked something called the I.W.W. hall , beat up everyone they found inside , and drove the rest out of the city . I read that the loggers hired a new hall and on Armistice Day , 1919 , people broke through the door and there was shooting . Wesley Everest fired his rifle and ran for the woods . He was captured crossing a river and brought back to jail . Then I read , " That night the city lights were turned off . A mob smashed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys , here 's your man , ' said the guard . Wesley Everest met them on his feet . Tell the boys I did my best , ' he whispered to the men in the other cells . " They took him off in a limousine to the Chehalis River bridge . As Wesley Everest lay stunned in the bottom of the car a Centraliabusinessman cut his penis and testicles off with a razor . Wesley Everest gave a great scream of pain . Somebody has remembered that after a while he whispered , For God 's sake , men , shoot me .. do n't let me suffer like this . ' Then they hanged him from the bridge in the glare of the headlights . " I read those last two paragraphs again . Then I finished reading to the end . " Nobody knows where they buried the body of WesleyEverest .... "  |p197I  returned the book to the shelf . My hands were shaking and I could not breathe . I slid past the suspicious gaze of a librarian and hurried down the marble staircaseto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , trying to take deep breaths . A queer heaviness lay upon my chest . The rain came through the leaves and fell upon the puddles on the sidewalks . Along the darkly glistening asphalt of the streets , cars moved cautiously , tires hissing . People scurried along beneath umbrellas . I needed to go to the bathroom . I turned off the parkway into a side street and could no longer control my trembling . The strange heaviness still lay upon my chest . Then I felt the flow of urine begin to seep slowly from between my legs and into my panties and down along the insides of my thighs . I stood under a tree in the rain and felt the hot rush flow outward . The street was empty save for automobile traffic . I began to run . I ran along the side street and then through the street where I lived and up the stoop and through the doors and up the staircase into the apartment . The singing of the door harp startled me . My mother must have untaped the wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me she would do that . Why had n't she told me ? I would have said not yet , I did n't want music yet , it was too soon for me to be hearing again the singing of the harp . In my room I removed my clothes . Naked , I went to the bathroomand washed myself . Peering down at the ridges and valley between my legs , I felt suddenly nauseated and thought I would vomit . I sat down on the toilet . After a moment the nausea passed . I returned to my room and put on fresh clothes . I did not know what to do with my wet underpants . I went into the kitchen and threw them into the garbage pail under the sink . They would be in the alleyway that night with the cans of garbage and the roaming cats . I lay on my bed and put my hand over my eyes . What had they done with Wesley Everest 's  --  ? Paul Bunyan . What a sweet story that had been each time my father had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge ax , his blue ox . Through halfsleepI heard a great scream of pain and sat bolt upright on thep198bed , shaking . I lay dazed in a sleep of exhaustion when my mother came home . During supper that night I said , " Did Papa see what happened to that poor man Wesley Everest in Centralia ? " My mother coughed and put down her knife and fork and stared at me . " I read it in a book today . About what happened to  --  " My mother broke sharply into my words . " I do not want to talk about that at the table , " she said . We ate in silence . After supper I asked my mother , " Did they really do that to that man ? " " Yes , " she said . " How could they do that ? What kind of people would do that ? " " Rana , I wish you had not  --  " " Did Papa see them do it ? " She hesitated . " Yes , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too frightened to tell anyone . " " It 's not a story ? " " No , Rana . " " But it 's in a book that 's a story . " " It happened , " my mother said . " I 'm scared , Mama . " " Come here . Come to me . Let me hold you . Would you like to go to the movies tonight ? Maybe there 's a funny movie playing in the neighborhood . All right ? Rana , tell me something . How did you find that book ? " I told her . She stared at me and shook her head ; but she said nothing . Later we went to a movie but I can not remember what it was . I closed my eyes during the Movietone News and put my hands over my ears  --  and suddenly understood what the word Newsreel meant in the book by John Dos Passos . Sitting in the cavernous darkness of that theater , with my eyes and ears closed against the horrors of the war on the screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everest was a logger like Paul Bunyan , " and the words , " Wesley Everest gave a great scream of pain . " In the morning I walked to the synagogue and sat alongside the dividing curtain , peering through the distorting fabric at the boy who stood at the lectern leading the service , and then seeing him clearly through the tear in the ninon . the obligations and privileges of an adult Jew . No , Ruthie had said in response to my question , girls did n't become bar mitzvah , only boys . And she had giggled . The synagogue was crowded . Cool air blew in through the open windows on the men 's side of the large room . I saw David and his father sitting together near the front of the room , watched them rise and say the Kaddish together and then sit down . No woman rose to say the Kaddish . I had noticed that over the weeks I had been coming here : no woman ever recited the Kaddish . The boy at the lectern completed the service and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had a high sweet voice . The room was hushed as he read . All around me women sat beaming . He faltered once , was quietly corrected by one of the men who stood near him at the podium , and went on . Soon after he was done with the reading , the Torah scroll was lifted and wrapped and given to a boy about my age to hold ; he sat on a ( hair , clutching the scroll tightly . The bar mitzvah commenced chanting aloud from a book . Candies were thrown when he was done . An elderly man in a long graying beard rose to continue the service . The Torah was returned to the ark . Someone gave a brief talk . All rose as the elderly man resumed the service . I was very tired . My heart beat fiercely ; I thought the woman sitting next to me would hear it pounding . I held the prayerbook tightly ; I could read the alphabet . Many words were familiar to me now ; I could speak them , though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange to be deriving comfort from unclear words ; I could n't understand that . We rose for the long silent prayer . I stood thinking of my fa/ther and the nun whose life he had tried to save . Then I thought of Wesley Everest and the events in Centralia  --  and I began to understand how it might be possible for a life to be changed in a moment by a single startling event . I must have dozed . I sensed a silence about me and opened my eyes . Peering through the opening in the curtain , I saw David and his father rising to their feet . And then I was on my feet too , listening to the voices on the other side of the curtain and reciting faintly with the men the words of the Kaddish , which I found , to my astonishment , that I knew by heart . There was a surge of whispering , a soft surflike rush of sound from the women around me . Someone said , " What is she doing ? " Another said something in Yiddish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to be more for you , Papa , than just one memorial service . Can one recite the Kaddish for a father who was n't a Jew ? I did n't care . I went on . The Kaddish ended . I sat down and closed my eyes , feeling upon my face the hot stares of all those nearby . The service went on . Then , moments later , I heard again the words of the Kaddish , and I rose and began to recite them too , louder this time , and I thought I heard one or two of the women answer , " Amen . " Outside on the sidewalk after the service David came over to me and said , " Good Shabbos , Ilana . " I returned his greeting . He fidgeted uncomfortably . " Ilana , " he said . " Listen . " I looked at him . " Girls do n't recite Kaddish . Women are n't  --  " " Does it make any difference that my father was n't Jewish ? " I asked . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talmud teacher . But that 's not what I 'm  --  " " I 'm very tired , David . I have to go home now . " I left him there staring at me as I turned and walked off . I had no sensation of walking . The warm May sunlight seemed a perverse and malevolent counterpoint to my feelings and filledp201me with despair . I shivered with cold . The streets of the neighborhoodwere gray and unfamiliar . I walked as in a stupor , turningfearful corners like some blind and unthinking creature , coming upon my own street , filled now with playing children and old women on their stoops and young mothers with baby carriagesand men washing their cars and others returning from the synagogues of the neighborhood . Out of habit I walked carefully beneath the trees , avoiding the cracks and roots in the sidewalk ; out of habit I waved at neighbors and responded to their greetings ; out of habit I raised my eyes to my window in the castlelike turret that formed the side of the house . And there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our living room , I saw my mother 's face and , beside her , a pale visage that seemed an apparition . I stopped and stared and felt the surge of blood in my ears . I flew up the stone stoop and the inside stairway and through the apartment door , which my mother had opened for me . Behind me I Beard distinctly the singing of the door harp as I flung myself into the gaunt arms of Jakob Daw . And I buried my head in his chest , saw out of the sides of my eyes the face of my mother , her wet eyes , her trembling lips , and felt suddenly the rush of all the weeks of grief and the ocean of pain pouring forth . And I wept like the child I was.  |p202That  same day a letter from Aunt Sarah addressed to my mother arrived in the mail . Aunt Sarah was somewhere near Madrid . I asked Uncle Jakob if he had seen Aunt Sarah in Spain and he said no , he had n't , because she worked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The three of us sat around the kitchen table as my mother read the letter aloud . " Dearest Anne . The Lord gave , and the Lord hath taken away ; blessed be the name of the Lord . ' " I loved my brother . I find that I can not believe he is dead . Unlike my parents ; I did not think that politics should sunder a family . That belief is reinforced every day in this dark and tragic land . The hatred here of man toward man is boundless and unfathomable , the slaughter is unimaginable . We are a vile and cursed species and were it not for the grace of God all life would be a hopeless travail . I know such faith is for you a chimera , an illusion cast upon us by those in power so as to make existence bearable and their power impregnable . But , my dear Anne , is n't what you call an illusion simply someone else 's dream with which you disagree ? And what of your workers ' revolution , your classless society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , economic scarcity , individual degradation and misery ? If faith in God is merely an illusion , then why not faith in man too ? Anne , are your dreams too not an illusion ? It seems to me that those who do not carep203what means are used to achieve their ends , indeed who justify all in the name of an end , need illusions far more than those others who see in mankind suffering and sin and the radiant power of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ . " Forgive me , Anne . I did not mean to burden you with a homilyin this time of grief but to say that though. - I despised my brother 's political ideas , I loved him as a person ; and I prayed that such love would be a possibility for us all . I prayed that with pa-t fence and compassion I would win him back to the true path , or , at the very least , learn to understand something of his path and thus not sever myself from him , from my only brother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I did not lose him , and so at least to that extent my prayers were answered . But how naive I was to believe in the power of patience and love in all mankind ! How foolish ! The rivers of blood that now soak the soil of Spain are a testament to the unredemptive savagery of mankind . A time to kill , and a time to heal ; a time to break down , and a time to build up . ' How we love our killing time ! We appear to need it . I do not know why . I realize now that events do occur to some of us that set us upon our life 's path . I do not know exactly what it was that happened to Michael in Centralia and that changed him so . He never told me . I wish he had . " Dear Anne , let us not sever the feelings between us because my brother is no longer alive . We are linked together by memoriesand by the lovely life that is ' Ilana Davita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a respite from the carnage that is Spain . The truth is that the Republican cause is lost , the . Rebels triumph . Shall we somehow see one another ? Yours in affection . Sarah . " My mother stopped reading and sat very ' still , gazing down at the letter . " She is at least correct about the outcome of the war , " Jakob Daw said , and coughed briefly . There was another sheet of paper in the-envelope : a letter to me . I took it from my mother and read it quickly to myself . Then I read it aloud.  | " Dearest Davita . This is your Aunt Sarah writing . How I loved your father and how I shall miss him ! What shall I say to you ? Your father was a soldier ; his weapons were words . He would have wanted you to have courage and to be strong . I shall be at the farmhouse this summer . Is the lovely picture of the horses on the beach still hanging on the wall ? Perhaps Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together for a while  --  your mother , you , and I. How I wish we two could pray together again as we once did , on our knees before Jesus Christ ! I wish you strength , Davita . Remember your father 's kindness and laughter and , more important , his love for your mother and you . I send you my love . I pray for you and your mother constantly . Aunt Sarah . " There was another silence . Jakob Daw put his delicately boned hand to his mouth and coughed . My mother asked , " What did Aunt Sarah mean about your praying together on your knees ? " I told her about that and saw her exchange looks with Jakob Daw . " It 's late , " my mother said . " I think we should eat lunch . Ilana , will you help me ? " " Uncle Jakob , where will you be living ? " " I do not know as yet . " His voice was hoarse , raspy . He was thinner now than he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . His straight dark hair was combed back flat . All his features  --  the arching eyebrows and sharp-edged nose and concave cheeks and slightly pointed jaw  --  had become harshly angular and somewhat exaggerated in a face that was now nearly skeletal-looking . Yet I felt strength in him , felt a quality of being I did not understand , a strong and nearly overpowering sense of his presence as he sat there next to me at the kitchen table . " You could live in the room next to me where Aunt Sarah stayed , " I said eagerly . Jakob Daw smiled . " We will see , " he said . " Help me set the table , Ilana . We 'll talk later about where your Uncle Jakob will stay . "  | " Will you tell me more stories about the bird ? " " I shall first have to think if there is anything more to tell . " " You 're putting the knives on the wrong side of the plate , Ilana , " my mother said . " Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have lunch and then I will lie down . I am very tired . It is a big ocean and it seems to get bigger each time I cross it . " He coughed again , his thin shoulders shaking , his face as white as the paper on which Aunt Sarah had written her letters . He slept the entire afternoon , woke briefly for a light supper , and slept again . My mother had to be out somewhere that eveningand I wandered about the apartment , stopping from time to time at the window in my parents ' bedroom and gazing out at the slowly darkening sky . I saw Ruthie standing in the backyard near the Rowers her father had planted . I thought about the sunsets over Sea Gate and imagined the cottage and the dunes and the long gentle glide of the beach toward the surf and the castles I had built in the wet sands of the tidal pool . I stopped by the partly open door to Jakob Daw 's room and peered inside . The light was dim . How thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his nostrils , the delicate rise of his thin sipper lip , the full and feminine lower lip , the boniness and chalky whiteness of his face  --  a sticklike figure in baggy pants and rumpledshirt , lying still and softly breathing . He seemed the most fragile person I had ever known . I came into my room and sat at my desk awhile , reading another of the books Ruthie 's father had asked her to bring up to mc . The doorbell rang . I went to open the door . The harp sang clearly in the silent apartment . I t was David and his father . " Hello , Ilana , " Mr. Dinn said solemnly , looking tall and austere . " How are you ? " He said something that sounded like " Goot voch . " David , not looking directly at me , said hello in a shy voice and repeated what his father had said.  |p206I  stood in the doorway , looking at them . They were dressed in their Shabbos clothes  --  dark suits , dark ties , dark hats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dinn said . " Is your mother home ? " I told him my mother was at some kind of meeting . " Did Mr. Daw arrive safely ? " " Yes . He 's asleep . " " Good . I wo n't bother him . Please tell your mother  --  " Jakob Daw came out of his room . His hair was disheveled and his eyes blinked repeatedly . He looked gaunt , untidy . " The doorbell woke me , " he said in his hoarse , phlegmy voice . He seemed a bit dazed . " Who is it , Ilana ? Hello ? Is it someone for me ? " " It 's Mr. Dinn and his son , David . " " Dinn ? " Jakob Daw said . He appeared to collect himself quickly and advanced into the hallway toward the door . " Come in , come in . Channah went to a meeting and will be back soon . I thank you for all you did . Please come in . " Mr. Dinn shook Jakob Daw 's hand and I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A pleasure to meet you , " he murmured . " An honor . I apologize for waking you . " " No , no , I slept too much today . Ilana , can we make a glass of tea for Mr. Dinn ? Or , better , perhaps a cold drink . Yes ? Good . " They came into the apartment . Jakob Daw and Mr. Dinn started along the hallway to the kitchen . I closed the door . David turned , attracted by the play of sounds on the harp as the balls struck the taut wires . " What 's that ? " " A door harp . " " I never saw anything like that . " " It belonged to my father . " " It 's pretty . I like the music . " " Do you want to see my room ? " The question flustered him . Behind me I heard a key go into the lock and the door opened.  |p207My  mother stood in the doorway . The harp sang . She saw David and looked astonished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and closing the door . " David . Hello . " I heard Jakob Daw call from the kitchen . " Channah ? Dinn is here . We are in the kitchen . " " Can I bring David into my room ? " I asked my mother . " Of course , " my mother said , removing her beret . " Maybe another time , " David said , looking uncomfortable , his eyes darting about . " Oh , please , David . " " Go ahead , " my mother said , and went quickly up the hallway and into the kitchen . David followed me to my room and stood in the doorway , looking at my chair and desk and bed and bookcase . " You 're very neat , " he said . " Come inside , " I said . " Why are you standing in the doorway ? " He took small halting steps into the room and slipped into the chair at the desk . He was still wearing his dark hat . I sat on the edge of my bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over my knees . I saw him look down at the Hebrew book on my desk . " You read Hebrew ? " he asked . " Where 'd you get this book ? " " I 'm teaching myself to read . It 's not hard . Ruthie and her fatherhelp me . It 's Mr. Helfman 's book . " He scanned the shelves of my bookcase . " You like fairy tales ? " " I love fairy tales . I love stories . My  --  my father and my mother got me those books . Do n't you like fairy tales ? " " No . Fairy tales are for girls . " " Where 'd you hear that ? Do n't you like stories that come from your imagination ? " " No . I do n't like my imagination . It keeps me awake at night . Sometimes it keeps me from studying . Sometimes it shows me things that scare me . " " What things ? "  | " Things . People . " " What people ? " " Sometimes it shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him and said nothing . He gazed down at the floor , his face very pale , his lips trembling faintly . All the time he talked he would not look directly at me . " I miss my mother , " he said . " Every day I see her dead in my imagination . " I did not know what to say . " I know my mother is with God , " he said . " But I see her in her grave and I ca n't help it . I ca n't help how I see her . " He was still not looking at me as he spoke . " It helps if I study a lot . That keeps my imagination away . " " I 'm not afraid of seeing my father in my imagination . I love to see my father . There 's a picture of three horses on a beach in my parents ' room , and now sometimes I see my father riding one of the horses . " " Do you ever see him in his grave ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was blown up by a big bomb and no one could find anything . " He looked at me then and his mouth fell open . Then he looked slowly away . " I think imagination is a wonderful thing , " I said . " My Aunt Sarah told me it helped the pioneer women who had to live alone when their husbands were away hunting . Sometimes it gives me very bad dreams . But it gives me nice dreams too . Especially in school . It helps me get through my classes . " " You do n't like your classes ? " " They 're boring . " " My school is n't boring . " " Sometimes I fall asleep in class and have dreams . Sometimes I dream with my eyes open . " " What do you dream ? " " All kinds of things . Stories . " " You would n't find my school boring . "  | " I could n't go to your school , David . I do n't know enough I Iebrew . " " You could learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hebrew when they come in . They learn . " " And I do n't believe in God . " Once again he looked straight at me . " You do n't believe in  --  ? Why do you come to shul ? " " I like to be with everyone . I like to listen to the songs . I like it when the Torah is taken out and read . It 's warm and nice . It feels good and everything feels like it 's being changed into something very beautiful like when I was building the castles on the beach . Remember ? I do n't like the curtain though . I do n't like having to sit behind the wall where I ca n't see clearly . Why do they have that wall ? I do n't like it when people are separated like that . " " It 's the law , " he said quietly , still looking at me . " Someone should change it . " " You ca n't do that . God made the law . " " No He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then they say that God made them so that everyone will obey . My parents taught me  --  " He broke in angrily , " Your parents are  --  " He stopped and fidgetedon the chair through a brief silence . Then he said , " Are you going to keep saying Kaddish for your father ? " " Yes . " " You really should n't , Ilana . You really do n't have to . Everyone'stalking about it . " " Will they tell me to leave the shul if I keep saying it ? " " I do n't know . I do n't think so . " My mother called us from the kitchen . " I do n't understand why a girl ca n't say it . " " A woman does n't have to pray , she does n't have to come to shul . Why are you doing it ? " My mother called us again . " I have to do more for my father than just attend one memorial meeting . He was my father . "  |p210David  said nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . My mother called us a third time . We went from my room and along the hallway toward the kitchen , our footsteps echoing faintly on the wooden floor . My mother , Mr. Dinn , and Jakob Daw looked at us as we came into the kitchen . They were standing at the table . Mr. Dinn held in his hand two new white candles whose tips had been scraped back , exposing additional lengths of wick ; the wicks were bent towardeach other . On the table was a small glass dish in which was a reddish substance ; next to the dish was a shot glass filled nearly to overflowing with an amber liquid that , upon my coming close to it , smelled like my father 's Scotch . " David , we 'll make Havdoloh here , " Mr. Dinn said . His dark hat was tipped back on his head . David looked very surprised . " Here ? " he blurted out . " Why here ? " " Because Mr. Daw has requested it . " " For my dead grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service he loved most . The Havdoloh . I would stand next to him while he said it . My father , you must understand , was first a followerof the ideas of Lassalle and later of Bakunin . Those names mean nothing to you , of course . And yet my father could never once bring himself to forbid me to listen to my grandfather 's Havdoloh and to drink the wine afterwards . " " Tonight we 'll have Scotch instead of wine , " Mr. Dinn said . " We do n't seem to have the proper wine in this house . " My mother looked down at the glass dish and the shot glass on the table and said nothing . " In Madrid , " Jakob Daw said in his raspy voice , " I once said to myself that if I came out alive I would do something that would make my grandfather happy . I said it again in Bilbao , and I said it three or four times in Barcelona . Once I said it very loudly in Barcelona so I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listens to such promises . I do not believe in God , you understand , but I do believe in my grandfather 's Havdoloh. "  |p211Mr  . Dinn handed the candles to David , who held them tightly together , his eyes fixed on the wicks . " The word havdoloh means separation , " Mr. Dinn said . " We separate the Shabbos from the other days of the week . First we light the candles as a sign of this separation , because you 're not permitted to use fire on Shabbos . " The hand in which David held the candles shook slightly . Mr. Dinn struck a match and , a moment after it flared into life , reached over and turned off the kitchen light . Shadows danced on the ceiling and walls . My mother 's eyes shone in the flame . " At home we use one candle with many wicks , " Mr. Dinn said softly . " It 's a beautiful candle of many colors . " " I remember such a candle , " Jakob Daw said . Lights and shadowsplayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the match and became fused into a single tall flame . " The spices in the dish help to make the service more beautiful by their aroma , " Mr. Dinn said . " Some say their purpose is to strengthen you for the coming week 's burdens . At home we have a special silver box for the spices . My wife , of blessed memory , bought it . " I saw David look up at his father , his mouth slightly open , his eyes wide and dark . " I remember my grandfather 's box , " Jakob Daw said . " It was a filigreed silver box shaped like the tower of a castle . " " Yes , " said Mr. Dinn . " Exactly . " I looked at David . He was staring uneasily at the flame . A narrowspiral of smoke rose upward from the candles and vanished into the ceiling shadows . My mother stood very still , saying nothing . Mr. Dinn raised the little glass in his right hand and began to chant . His eyes were closed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a rich baritone voice that rang out clearly in the small kitchen but did not assault our ears . The melody moved through the apartment , returning faintly from distant corners . ' Chen David and his father chanted something briefly together , and Mr. Dinn went on alone . He put the glass down on the tablep212and picked up the dish of spices . He said a blessing over the spices , sniffed them , and gave the dish to Jakob Daw , who sniffed and passed it to my mother . She put the dish briefly to her nose and gave it to David , who took a deep breath of the spices and passed it to me . The scent was sweet , heady , aromatic . I put the dish back down on the table . Wax was running down the candle onto David 's fingers . His hand continued its faint trembling . Mr. Dinn cupped his hands together , knuckles down , and moved them close to the flame . He chanted a blessing and opened his hands so that the light of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his left hand . Jakob Daw , my mother , and I did nothing for a moment . Then I saw Jakob Daw extend his arms , cup his hands , and open his palms . How pale his hands looked , how dry and brittle ! I could see ridges of bones , outlines of veins . Mr. Dinn raised the glass again and went on chanting , his voice louder now . Then he was done and he sipped from the glass and put it down and David blew out the candle . The lights came back on in time for us to see a small column of smoke drifting upward from the extinguished candle and forming a thin cloud below the ceiling . Jakob Daw stood very still next to my mother , his eyes closed . " Goot voch , " Mr. Dinn said . " I wish everyone a good week . " He kissed his son . He shook my mother 's hand  --  with a special tenderness , I thought . He bent to kiss my head and I sensed in him a rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not thought him capable of deep feelings . " Goot voch , Mr. Daw , " he said , offering his hand . Jakob Daw opened his eyes and for a moment seemed not to know where he was . He shook Mr. Dinn 's hand . " Some memories are good , most are bad , " Jakob Daw said . " This was a good memory . " " You can make Havdoloh by yourself , " Mr. Dinn said . " You do n't need someone to do it for you . "  | " There are many things I can not do by myself , " Jakob Daw said , " and Havdoloh is one of them . I appreciate the memory . Believeme when I tell you that in Barcelona I did not think I would ever be in Brooklyn listening to a Jew make Havdoloh . It is all very strange . Nothing I write could ever be as strange as our real world . " " We must go , " Mr. Dinn said . " I 'll come over tomorrow and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested . There will definitely be trouble . That much I know . " " It is probably someone who does not like my stories . I have been told that my stories often have strange effects upon my readers . " " It 's not your stories , it 's your politics . " " But I no longer have any politics . I have renounced my party affiliation . Stalinism is dead for me after Barcelona . " My mother gave Jakob Daw a piercing look . " We 'll have to convince the people at Immigration , " Mr. Dinn said . " Will that be difficult to do ? " " Yes , " Mr. Dinn said . " But what can they do to me ? I have the visa . It was given to me by a fine gentleman in Marseilles . Can they revoke a visa ? " " They can come up with a visa charge . They can claim fraud . They can do a deep search and charge you with failure to disclose some petty offense . It 's called material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they really want to . Or they can simply let the visa run out and not renew it . " " You are saying , if I understand you correctly , that I am in the clutches of a bureaucracy and now share the common lot of the working class . Perhaps it would have helped if I were a different kind of writer . What a pity ! It would be so ironic to have come to America only to be sent back to Europe for something I no longer am . It would be a little like living inside one of my own stories . " " You wo n't be sent back , " Mr. Dinn said . " I can promise you that . Come , David . We have to go . Say good night . "  | " Will you visit me again ? " I asked David . " I do n't know , " he said , not looking at me directly . My mother accompanied David and his father to the door . I heard the harp . My mother came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What happened at the meeting ? " Jakob Daw asked . " Precisely what you expected . They were delicate but firm . " " Well , " Jakob Daw said , " it is beginning . Barcelona or Brooklyn , they are the same Stalinists . " " I do n't want to hear you talking like that , Jakob , " my mother said . " No ? Listen to me , Channah . I was in Barcelona . My eyes saw this . They slaughtered anarchists , Trotskyists , P.O.U.M. people . Stalin 's hand purged Barcelona . If it were not for Ezra Dinn and the visa waiting for me in Marseilles , I would have remained in Barcelona and would now be either in a jail or dead . It was more important for the Communists in Barcelona to kill anti-Stalinist workers than to kill Fascists . This my eyes saw , Channah . " " The party is my life , Jakob , " my mother said in a small voice . " I do n't know what to do . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I am very tired . " He went out of the kitchen and along the hallway to his room . I woke in the night to go to the bathroom and passed by the partly open door to Jakob Daw 's room . He was at the small desk , writing . Later I woke again after a vivid dream about my father : he was swimming in the ocean off the beach at Sea Gate and three horses suddenly thundered across the sand and when I looked again for my father I could not see him . I woke with my heart beating fiercely and got out of bed to go through the hallway to the bathroom  --  and there was Jakob Daw at the little desk in his room , still writing , the desk lamp brushing his face with a soft and luminous wash of yellow light . He still had on his clothes of the day before , and I wondered if he had slept at all . He wore hisp215spectacles and , in the moment or two that I stood there watching , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes were on fire . I heard nothing save the scratching of his fountain pen on paper and it seemed to me a wondrously musical sound . Words and ideas were coming from him through his fingers and pen onto raper , and a story was being created ! I was seeing it but I could not understand it , this act of creating a story . My mother went out early the following morning . Jakob Daw was asleep . I wandered about the apartment . In my mother 's bedroomI stopped to gaze at her large bed and wondered what she must feel like sleeping alone and knowing my father would never return . I opened her closet , saw her few clothes and shoes : skirts , dresses , a cardigan sweater , spectator shoes , pumps , walking shoes , slippers . On a shelf were her berets and two purses . Then I opened my father 's closet . His clothes and shoes were still there . That wasstrange feeling , standing there and staring at my dead father 's Iothes and shoes . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed the closet door . The bed had been neatly made with its pale blue flowered spread . Near the bed I saw an open carton with a white label on which were printed the words SPECIAL WRITING in my father 's hand . My father 's desk was clean ; my mother used it now for her own writing . I stood in the doorway and it seemed to me my father was everywhere in that room  --  on the bed , at the desk , by the window , in the corners . I went back through the hallway to my room and spent the rest of the morningat my desk , reading . My mother returned home shortly before lunch . Jakob Daw woke coughing and came out of his room in the same clothes he had worn the day before . His door was across the hallway from mine and I saw him stagger a little as he went from his room . He appeared haggard , exhausted . His eyes were swollen , his face unshaven . He saw me looking at him and said something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallway , coughing . The bathroom door closed . In the kitchen my mother dropped something : the noise ofp216shattering glass was abrupt and jarring . Angry words exploded from her , uttered , it seemed to me , in the same language Jakob Daw had used a moment before . In the early afternoon the three of us walked along the parkway to Prospect Park . For some fresh air , my mother said . We all needed fresh air . We watched people rowing on the lake . There were small fish in the lake and they made tiny rippling circles along the surface of the water as they fed off the bread crumbs people threw them . The park was crowded . We sat on a bench with our faces to the sun . Birds flew high overhead against a cloudless sky . My mother and I had come to this park with my father the day before he had sailed back to Spain . That seemed a long time ago . When had that been ? I asked Jakob Daw if he knew how to row a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone , speaking not to me but to the sky and the air , that it was another of the many things he could not do . " There were other things to do in Vienna when I was growing up . Many other things . I rowed through Schnitzler and Hofmannsthal . And through Marx and Freud and others . Those were deep and beautiful lakes . Sometimes they became wide rivers . Once I even rowed through Theodor Herzl , but it proved uninteresting . But I did not learn to row in ordinary water . " He coughed . " Another of my many failings , along with ineptitude in the trenches and in  --  " He stopped , glanced at my mother , and looked quickly away . " In other matters . " He leaned back on the bench , his hands clasped behind his head . He had changed into different clothes , as baggy and as wrinkled as those he had worn before . I was sitting between him and my mother and felt a gray sadness rising from him and , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some dark mesmerizingforce . He had cut himself while shaving ; a clot of blood lay on his bony chin . I wanted to touch the blood , wash it away , dress the wound . The afternoon sunlight accentuated the network of small lines around his eyes and showed clearly the flecks of gray inp217his hair . I could not remember having seen gray in his hair when I had first met him last year in our apartment in Manhattan . My mother had been sitting quietly , looking at the lake . Shet wore a white beret and a dark blue skirt . " I used to go rowing , " she said . " With my grandfather . We lived near a wide river . He used to take me rowing when I was a little girl . I was too young to row the boat myself . And then the war came and we ran from the town  --  it was a border town between Russia and Poland , and we were told the Russian cavalry was coming . We hid in a forest . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever did . " " Did n't you ever go rowing with your father ? " I asked . " I never did anything with my father . Once my mother took me out on the river and we almost overturned the boat . My mother was a very modern woman , but she did n't know anything about boats . Your father had an uncle once who knew about boats . But he died in a boating accident . I do n't like boats . Boats frighten me . People I love keep going away from me on boats . " We sat on the bench in the sunlight , looking at the lake . " Mama ? " " Yes , darling . " " Will we go to the beach this summer ? " " I do n't know . I will have to work all summer . There 's no more money from your father 's job . And I will not take money from  --  " She stopped . " I do n't know about the summer , Ilana . " Jakob Daw had closed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , with his eyes closed , " How serious do you think it is , Channah ? " " If Ezra is worried , it 's very serious . " " I used to boast about being hated by the right people . I am not boasting now . I am very tired . " My mother said nothing . " I am not looking forward to another sea journey . " Still my mother said nothing . " I will not fight to remain here , Channah . I do not wish to becomea cause that the Stalinists and the Fascists will turn into ap218circus . Nor do I wish to live in a country where I will be hounded constantly by nameless government officials . I will not permit Ezra to waste his time with this . The French will take me in . The French appreciate my writing . Malraux himself is a devoted reader . The French will certainly take me back in . " " Stop it , Jakob , " my mother said . " I detest boats and ships , " Jakob Daw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I can not begin to tell you how much I detest boats and ships . Perhaps I will write a story about it one day . " Please stop it , " my mother said . " I think we should return to the apartment , " Jakob Daw said . " I am very , very tired . " " Can I help you , Uncle Jakob ? You can lean on me . " " You are a dear child . I hope someone will soon teach you how to row . Are you ready to start back , Channah ? " That evening my mother met again in our living room with the two men and the woman . They studied together . New words flew into my room : exchange value , commodities , universal money , labor power . Jakob Daw lay in his room , asleep . Later Mr. Dinn came over and he and my mother sat in the kitchen , talking . I woke in the night to go to the bathroom and saw Jakob Daw sitting at the desk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sibilant music in the dark stillness of the apartment . I walked home from school past the yeshiva and saw Ruthie playing in the wide front yard during her afternoon recess . The yard was crowded and noisy . A number of teachers stood along the rim of the sidewalk , forming a protective phalanx . Most of the teachers in the yard were women ; two of the men were young and wore beards . I waved to Ruthie . She came over to me . We stood in the shade of a sycamore . A car sped by close to the sidewalk . " We heard David 's father making Havdoloh in your apart/ment , " Ruthie said . She had been jumping rope and her freckled face was flushed and sweaty . " Why did he do that ? " " Mr. Daw asked him . " " David 's father said he would n't sing again outside his own house until after he stopped saying Kaddish . " " I did n't know . " " Are you going to keep saying Kaddish ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know . Girls do n't have to say Kad-dish . " " I want to . " " Everyone 's talking about you , Ilana . " I did not respond . One of the girls in the yard called Ruthie 's name . " Does n't it bother you that everyone is talking about you ? " " No . " " You should n't do it , Ilana . " One of the young , bearded teachers was looking at me . I said , " Ruthie , does your father ever take you rowing ? " She stared at me . " What ? " " In the lake in Prospect Park . Does your father ever take you rowing there ? " " My mother takes me . In the summer , mostly . " " Do you stay in the city in the summer ? " " We go to the country where there 's a lake . Are you all right , Ilana ? " " I 'm not all right . My Uncle Jakob may have to leave America . The government does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Once again a girl called her name . " I have to go home , " I said . " Maybe he 's awake and will want something to eat . What kind of government do we have ? Is it a Fascist government ? David 's father is trying to keep him here . I dreamed last night that he went away on a big boat , like my father . " The teacher who had been looking at me came over to us . Hep220was a short thin man with a dark beard and he wore a brown suit and a gray felt hat . He said something to Ruthie in what sounded like Yiddish . " Your uncle will be okay , " Ruthie said . " My father says that David 's father is a very good lawyer . " " I wonder if David 's father knows how to row . I 'll see you , Ruthie . Good-bye . I like the ocean anyway better than the lake . " I went along the parkway , turned up the side street , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The air was warm and bright ; brilliant sunlight covered the streets . On the street where I lived the brownstones seemed to be glowing in the sunlight and deep green shadows lay beneath the full-leafed trees . Baby carriages had been parked in the shade and in one of them a child lay crying . I looked up and saw Jakob Daw in the bay window of our living room . He had the apartment door open for me before I reached the landing . I heard the final notes of the door harp . As he closed the door behind me the door harp sang again . He asked how my day had been . I said school was boring . He looked surprised . We came into the kitchen . I brought a glass of milk and a plate of cookies to the table . He poured himself a cup of coffee . He was wearing the same rumpled pants he had worn on Saturday . He looked pale and weary . His eyes were red with fatigue , his cheeks sunken . From time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers . He said , in his hesitant way , that he had looked at the books in my room and hoped I did n't mind . Did I like the Hebrew books ? I told him I especially liked the books about the Bible . They were good stories , I said . " Stories , " he echoed softly . " And I like the fairy tale books . And the book about Paul Bunyan . I especially like that book . " Then I said , " Uncle Jakob , why did my father die ? " He looked down into his cup , his gaunt features tight . " Becausea Fascist airplane killed him . "  | " Why did he try to save the nun ? " " Because that was the kind of man your father was . " " If he had n't tried to save her he might still be alive . " Jakob Daw was quiet . Then he said , " If my grandmother hadhad wheels , she would have rolled . " I looked at him . " An old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not like to play the game of if , Ilana . It gives me a headache and , worse , a heartache . No ifs , please . " " Uncle Jakob , are you a stay-at-home writer ? " " What is a stay-at-home writer , Ilana ? Ah , yes , I see what you mean . Yes , I am mostly a stay-at-home writer . " " I wish my father had stayed home more . Did you see my fathermuch in Spain ? " " I was with your father in Madrid and then in Bilbao , before he went to Guernica and I went to Barcelona . I thought I might go to Lisbon , but that turned out to be impossible . It was difficult even to travel to Barcelona . Do those names mean anything to you ? " " I know all those places . I can show them to you on the map . " " Yes , " he said . " I am sure you can . " " Do you always write at night , Uncle Jakob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with noise . I can hear my voices better in the silence of night . The voices of the people I write about . " " Can you hear the voice of your little black bird better at night too ? " " Yes . But even at night that voice is weak . The bird is nowvery tired , Ilana . He is looking for a place to build a nest . " " I hope you wo n't go back to Europe , Uncle Jakob . " He said nothing . I watched as he went over to the stove , poured himself another cup of coffee , put in it a teaspoon of cocoafrom an open tin on the counter near the sink , stirred the cupbriefly with a teaspoon , and returned to the table . " Is America a Fascist country ? " I asked  | " No . But there are Americans who are Fascists . " " Is the man who wants to send you back to Europe a Fascist ? " " I do not know who wants to send me back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going back to Europe . " He drank from his cup and sat there staring down at the table . " I think I will lie down for a while , " he said . " I am very tired . Please forgive me , Ilana . " I sat at the table , listening to him go slowly along the hallway to his room . My mother returned from her work . Jakob Daw joined us for supper but said little . After supper my mother came into my room and stood near the door . " Ilana ? " I looked up from my reading . " Mrs. Helfman told me this morning that you said Kaddish in the synagogue . " I said nothing . " You are not supposed to say Kaddish . " " I want to . " " Ilana  --  " " I want to . " She looked at me and seemed not to know what to say . " Mama , do you want me to stop saying it ? " There was a silence . She stood rigidly near the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face pale . " I do n't even want you to go to that synagogue , " she said finally . " But I wo n't stop you . Not if it means that much to you . " And she went from my room . That night I woke and heard sounds from the darkness of the apartment . I thought at first that Baba Yaga had returned , but there was no evil in the sounds ; there was wind in trees and a distantsighing and the softest of laughter amidst the silken backand-forthsliding of night surf . And softly out of the darkness , through walls that somehow always yielded to my listening ears , came a far-off rhythmic beat like the thudding hooves of stallions racing across the red sands of an endless beach.  |p223The  days passed . Sometimes in the evenings visitors would come to the apartment , people I had never seen before . Many were well dressed . They would sit in the living room , speaking respectfullywith Jakob Daw and listening intently to his words . I marveled at the deference in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He seemed the shyest of people . Diffidence clung to him , a nervous reluctance to offend . He bent toward you as you spoke , inclined his ear to your words . On occasion he and my mother went out together of an evening . He never wore anything other than baggy pants and wrinkledshirts and sometimes an old sweater if the evening was cool . His shoes were scruffy , unpolished . Color had returned to his face ; much of the darkness was gone from around his eyes . He still coughed from time to time but I had come almost not to notice it . At times my mother and Jakob Daw would go to Manhattan on their evenings out and bring back newspapers and magazines in languages I could not read . Once Jakob Daw brought me a book of stories by two brothers named Grimm . " The brothers Grimm claimed they went out in the country among the German peasants and collected true folk tales , " he said when he gave me the book . " But now we know they lied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own family . Neverthelessthey ' are very interesting stories . " Rumpelstiltskin . Sleeping Beauty . Hansel and Gretel . I found I could not stop reading . Often Mr. Dinn would come into the apartment late at night and the three of them would sit together in the kitchen , talking . David said to me one Saturday as we stood outside the synagogue , " Do n't you know what 's going on , Ilana ? " " What do you mean ? " " Do n't you read the newspapers ? There are petitions and all kinds of letters being sent to Washington . "  | " I do n't read newspapers anymore . " " People are trying to save him . " " Uncle Jakob says it wo n't help . " " My father wo n't let him be sent away . " " Did you know there are Fascists in Washington , David ? Can your father fight Fascists ? " " My father says  --  " " David , are you going back to the beach this summer ? " " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother says we 're not going . We do n't have any money for the beach . " He looked down at the sidewalk . " The Fascists killed my father and now they 're going to send Uncle Jakob away . I wish you a good time at the beach , David . Do you know how to build sand castles ? Remember the one we built together ? That was nice . " " Ilana  --  " " I 'm tired . Did you notice that a lot of women answered amen when I said the Kaddish this morning ? Did you notice that ? " " No . " " Why did n't you and your father say Kaddish ? " " We do n't have to anymore . You say it for eleven months after the funeral . " " I 'm going to miss the beach . We do n't know where we 'll be this summer . Uncle Jakob is n't allowed to leave the city . Did you know that ? " " No . " " At least your friends do n't laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed at me . Good Shabbos , David . Your father has a beautiful voice . I wish he would lead the service in the syna-gogue . " I felt him watching me as I walked away . The air was warm on my face and arms . I moved with care so as not to trip over the cracks in the sidewalk . In the apartment I found Jakob Daw at the kitchen table ,  |p225drinking  coffee . He wore pajamas and a frayed dark-blue robe , and his hair was uncombed . He gazed at me for a moment and seemed not to know who I was . Then his eyes cleared . " Ilana . Good morning . Is it morning ? Where were you ? " " In shul . " " Shul , " he said . " Yes . Your mother went out shopping . There is a note here somewhere from her . Where did I put it ? Take yourself some milk and cookies and sit down and keep me com-pany . " " Were you up all night writing ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to sleep as the birds woke . Do you hear the birds in the morning ? " " Yes . " " Beautiful sounds . Beautiful music to fall asleep to . Yes , sit here . Be careful with your milk . I remember the birds on the beach . Do you remember those birds ? " " Yes . " " Some made very strange sounds . Like women laughing and crying . Is the weather nice outside ? " " It 's warm . " " Perhaps we will go for a walk later . It is not healthy to be indoorsso much . In Europe people walk much more than they do here . Europe is made for walking . We will go to the park and watch the rowers on the lake . " " Uncle Jakob ? " " Yes , Ilana . " " Are they going to send you away ? " " I do not know . They are certainly trying . " " David Dinn said that lots of people are writing letters and signing petitions to keep you from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing that . But I do not think  --  " I heard the downstairs door close with its loud click and thought it was my mother with shopping bags . " Mama is coming back . " I went to the door and opened it and heard Ruthie and her par/ents in the hallway downstairs . I closed the door and turned . Jakob Daw had come up behind me . The music of the door harp resonated softly through the apartment . Jakob Daw stood very still , watching the wooden balls as their motion slowed and the music died away . Then he lifted one of the balls with his fingers and let it fall on the taut wire . Ting . The sound echoed softly . Ting ting ting ting ting . He lifted a second wooden ball and let it fall . Then he began to lift them one after the other . They bounced jauntily upon the wires . The hallway filled with the music of the harp . I stood there watching him and then heard him say , to the accompaniment of the music of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hourappens to ou little bird , Ilana . Shall I tell you ? . Yes ? . All right . " He was silent a moment , the wooden balls rising and fallingbeneath his fingers , the harp sending out its vibrating tones . " Our little bird flew back across the ocean . Yes , he flew and flew against the wind . " The harp sang and sang as Jakob Dam 's fingers kept lifting the wooden balls and letting them fall . " The wind was very strong . And cold . And the bird was burdened with strange baggage : bits and pieces of broken dreams that kept piercinghis troubled heart like shards of glass . He did not care anymoreabout the music of the world . He wanted to rest . He flew on against the wind , straining his fragile wings . And as he flew a curiousthing happened : he began to grow smaller and smaller . And soon he was no larger than the tiniest of birds and you could barely see him in the vast sky . He flew low over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wave reached up as if to pull him down . And suddenly there along the horizon was the land ; and by this time the bird was no bigger than a butterfly . And still he grew smaller and smaller ; and soon he was no bigger than the tip of your thumb . And he grew smaller still and now he was the size of your fingernail . And he flew slowly over a beach and across land and came to a quiet street with houses and trees and he heard a peculiar music coming from one of the houses and he circled and circled about the house and flew in one day when the littlep227girl who lived in the house opened the door  --  and there was the music , rising from a bit of wood that hung from the door ! It was the kind of music the bird thought he could listen to forever : sweet but not false , a comfort but not a deceiving caress ; a music of innocence . And the bird continued growing smaller and smaller and then entered the circular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wires made their music . And there he nested . And there he lived . And there he lives to this day . And there he will continue to live . In our door harp . " He lowered his hand . The wooden balls grew still . The music faded . " In our door harp , " Jakob Daw said again , as if echoing his own words . Then he turned and went slowly into his room and closed the door . I stood very still in the silent hallway , staring up at the door harp . The downstairs lock clicked sharply . I opened the door . The harp sang . I listened to its music and imagined the tiny bird inside , listening too . I went quickly down the stairs to help my mother . Mr. Dinn came over that night with David and again chanted the Havdoloh prayers . Afterward we sat around the kitchen table . Mr. Dinn would not eat anything . David had a glass of milk but politely refused the cookies . It was a hot gloomy night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on in Washington , nothing like this had ever happened to him before . The pressure against Jakob Daw was enormous . Sometimes he had the feeling it was coming from inside the White House itself . Nothing he could be sure of ; nothing he could pin down . His Washington connections refused to talk to him about Jakob Daw . Sure , he was a great writer . He was also a Bolshevik . He was a Communist who had advocated revolution in speeches and articles . He was no longer a Stalinistp228but a Trotskyist ? The fine distinction was lost somewhere in the bureaucratic labyrinth at immigration . Someone wanted Jakob Daw out of the country . Indeed , maybe it had nothing to do with Jakob Daw 's communism . Maybe someone was making points with his department chief . Maybe someone was settling an old grudge . Maybe someone did n't like Jakob Daw 's stories . My mother sat staring down at the table and saying nothing . " We have a long way to go before it 's lost , " Mr. Dinn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities . " " In our time , Mr. Dinn , " Jakob Daw said , " a man whose enemiesare faceless bureaucrats almost never wins . It is our equivalentto the anger of the gods in ancient times . But those gods , you must understand , were far more imaginative than our bureaucrats . They spoke from mountaintops , not from tiny airless offices . They rode clouds . They were possessed of passion . They had voices and names . Six thousand years of civilization have brought us to this . Was it worth the effort ? I think I shall take another cup of coffee . You are spending so much time here these days we ought to make the apartment kosher so you might eat here . " David 's father smiled thinly . " Should we organize a demonstration ? " my mother said . " Demonstrations wo n't affect the law , Channah , " Mr. Dinn said . " I do not want demonstrations , " Jakob Daw said . " I do not want this to drag on and on and become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the right will demonstrate against me . We will go to the courts and get postponements and delays and in the end the government will win anyway . I have no desire and no strength for such a battle . We will go as far as the first hearing . " " But what can they possibly find that will bring you to a hearing ? " my mother asked . " I was a wild and wanton youth , " Jakob Daw said . " I relied heavily on wine as an antidote to shyness . But I have no recollectionof any criminal activity . "  | " Jakob , this is not a time for your dark humor , " my mother said . " I believe I was on the wanted list in Barcelona , " Jakob Daw said . " A few chance remarks on my part about the heroism I had witnessed by anarchist militia in the front lines around Huesca and how it might not be too difficult to sympathize with the P.O.U.M. secured for me a serious threat of arrest as a Fascist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Stalinists I had become a Fascist . Why does that not qualify Jakob Daw for permanent residencein America ? " My mother and Mr. Dinn looked at each other and said nothing . " You can not imagine what it was like in Barcelona . They said more than a thousand workers were slain . It was a civil war inside a civil war . Workers killing workers . Machine guns , grenades , rifles , barricades , red and black flags , anarchists and Stalinists and Trotskyists . You think the Russians desire revolution in Spain , Channah ? They do not . What they want is to preserve the friendshipof France , and France does not wish to see a revolutionary government on its southern border . The Communists of Spain are now counterrevolutionists and are killing anarchists , who are the true fighters for a workers ' revolution today . That was Barcelona , Channah . Do you hear me ? I was there . These eyes saw Barcelona . However , I do not think the people in Washingtonwill be impressed by the fact that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother rose stiffly from the table , went over to the stove , and refilled her coffee cup . She returned to the table . " Ilana , why do n't you and David go into your room for a while , " she said . " Mama . " " Do you mind , David ? " " No , " David said reluctantly . " Mama . " " Go ahead , Ilana. "  |p230I  finished my milk and went from the kitchen , followed hesitantlyby David . " Did you understand what they were saying ? " he asked as we went along the hallway . " Not all of it . " " I did n't understand the part about Barcelona . Your mother looked very upset . " We came into my room . " I do n't understand politics , " David said . " It 's very boring . " " No , it 's not . " " It 's boring to me . " " Was n't the Jewish revolution that Rabbi Akiva led against Rome politics ? And when Abraham destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem , and when all the Jews were expelled from Spain ? Was n't all that politics ? " " I did n't mean  --  " " If it 's American politics or politics about the world , you 're bored . But if it 's about Jews , you 're not bored . " He stared at me . " Please , I did n't mean to make you angry , Ilana . " " I 'm sorry , " I said . " I 'm sorry . " There was a brief silence . " They 're going to send Uncle Jakob away . How can they do that ? " David looked at me out of his wide dark eyes and made no response . The weeks of June went slowly by . School ended . The air grew sultry ; nights were hot . Terrifying rumors of polio in distant parts of the city drifted into our neighborhood . My mother would leave for work early in the morning and return to make supper . I played in the backyard with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sycamore and we would take turns on it . I loved the sensationp231of rising and falling , flying and plunging , the hot winds of the summer on my face . One day a big car came to the house and took Ruthie and her parents off to the mountains . I played on the street with the childrenof the neighborhood . On occasion I sat alone in the backyardnear the flowers , reading , daydreaming , waiting for Jakob I ) aw to waken so we could go to Prospect Park and the lake and the zoo and the botanical gardens . We went nearly every day . He had learned to row and often we went out on the lake . I sat in the boat in the sun and let him take me slowly across the smooth water . How calm the water was . How different from the churning ferocity of the ocean . And there was nothing here with which I could build a castle , no sand , no surf , only the mind-dulling calm of a mirrorlike lake . One Sunday in early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island and went along the boardwalk and sat on a blanket in the sand . Jakob Daw would not go into the water  --  would not even put on a bathing suit . I swam with my mother , the hot sun on my face , the waves swelling and cresting and falling , acrid salt water in my mouth and eyes and nose . Later that afternoon I built a castle with the help of Jakob Daw and my mother ; it came nearly to my shoulders . We left it there in the wet sand along the edge of the sea , glowing pink and red in the setting sun . I dreamed of the stallions that night , saw them galloping across a red beach , hooves thundering , sand flying , racing on the rim of the sea toward the horizon along which ships slowly moved beneathan evening sky . In the second week of July David Dinn left for Sea Gate . His father remained in the city and went to Sea Gate only for the weekends . He came often to the apartment , always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and listen to the three of them in the kitchen . In one of my dreams during those weeks a short , round man in a dark suit motioned to me from behind his desk , which was piled high with papers , and when I looked at him I saw his face was as vacant as an egg.  |p232The  week David left for Sea Gate Jakob Daw took me to ProspectPark . It was a hot sunny day and the park was crowded with mothers and little children . Jakob Daw took me out on the lake in a boat . I sat on the stern seat facing the sun and felt the smooth and lulling motion of the boat in the water . Jakob Daw rowed slowly and awkwardly and from time to time one of the oars would go into a skimming slide across the surface of the lake and send forth a spray of water . I saw dark water spots on his baggy trousers and wrinkled shirt . His long bony arms strained at the oars . The lake was crowded and he rowed cautiously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is clear to me , " he said , " that you prefer the ocean to this lake . " " I like the lake when you take me rowing on it . " " I see that people do not swim in this lake . It is for boating only . Still , it is a pretty lake and this is a fine park . Americans are capable here and there of the touches of civilization . Capitalism has not yet entirely swallowed up the land . Would you like an ice cream when we are done rowing ? " " Yes . " " So would I. I find that I have come to enjoy American ice cream . Is it too hot for you in the sun ? " " No . " " Perhaps you should wear a hat . Your blond hair will be bleached white in so much sun . " " No it wo n't , Uncle Jakob ! " He steered carefully between two boats . " Uncle Jakob ? " " Yes , Ilana . " " Can I ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Not the war in Spain . The big war . In Europe . " He looked at me . " The big war , " he said . " Yes . " " Were you hurt in that war ? " " I was gassed . In that war both sides used poison gas , and manyp233of the soldiers who breathed it died . I nearly died . I was not a very good soldier . I misplaced my gas mask and did not find it until it was almost too late . " " Were you in a hospital ? " " Oh , yes . For a long time . " He craned his neck and steered to avoid a boat . " Many months . " " Did you go back to the war ? " " No . They thought I was well enough to go back but I would not go , so they sent me off to another hospital . " " Another hospital for wounded soldiers ? " " A hospital for wounded minds . A terrible hospital . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Move back to the middle of your seat , Ilana . You are tipping the boat to one side . " " I did n't know they did that to soldiers . " " Oh , they did worse . Sometimes they shot you . " " Did they keep you in the second hospital a long time ? " " Yes , " he said . " Many years . " After a moment he said , " I think I will bring the boat in now , Ilana , and we will have our ice cream . All right ? Then we will go back . I am feeling a little tired . " He took me to the park twice again that week . He said nothing more about the war or his years in the hospital . On one of those days he told me another story about the gray horse who lived between the black horses of the mountains and the white horses of the plain  --  but I find I can not remember it now . Sometimes in the evenings the three of us went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All night long he wrote ; all morning long he slept . Sometimes in the night his room was empty , and I knew he was with my mother . That was the way the three of us lived during those hot July weeks of that summer of 1937 : walking , rowing , talking , working , playing  --  and waiting . The wait ended one evening in the third week of July shortly after supper.  |p234I  was sitting in my room at my open window , listening to the wind in the trees and reading . A black four-door car moved slowly up the street and came to a stop in front of our house . Two men got out . They wore dark suits . One of them looked at a paper in his hand and then at our house . Some boys playing a game of stoopball in front of the neighboring house paused to regard them curiously . The two men climbed up our front stoop . A moment later I heard the loud click of the downstairs door . My mother answered the ring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Through the hallway and into my room came a murmurous male voice and a rush of strange words : immigration police , warrant for arrest , deportation proceeding , hearing and review . Then I heard Jakob Daw 's voice . " Who is it , Channah ? Hello ? Is it for me ? " Again I heard a murmurous male voice . There was a long silence . " I understand , " Jakob Daw said . " Yes . " " I will call Ezra , " my mother said in a frantic voice that trembledand seemed on the edge of panic . There was another silence . Jakob Daw went into his room and came out a moment later . My mother called my name . I went quickly out of my room and saw Jakob Daw and two strange tall men and my mother in the hallway near the door . Jakob Daw said he was going away . His face was gray . I stared at him . My mother was crying silently . The two men regarded us impassively . Jakob Daw bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flooding rush of his dread and saw in his eyes an expression I had never seen before  --  abject helplessness . I will never forget that expression : the wide dark empty look in his eyes , the dead pallor of his face , the faintly quivering nostrils , the rigid lips , the tightenedskin of his skeletal features  --  as if his death mask were alreadyupon him . He said nothing more to me or to my mother . When I raised my arms to embrace him his arms remained stifflyp235in front of him and I felt them wedged beneath my body . I looked down and realized with a swooning sense of horror that he could not separate his arms because his wrists were shackled together with handcuffs . Jakob Daw went out between the two men and down the stairway . My mother went down with them , leaving our door open . I stood at my window and watched Jakob Daw climb into the car with the two men . My mother stood on the curb . The car pulled away and went quickly up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother came back into the apartment and closed the door . The harp sang sweetly in the silent hallway . ' I sat in the synagogue and listened to the service . The air was cold . I felt everyone staring at me . I looked down at my prayerbookand thought I might pray to God , but I did n't know what to say . I kept hearing the word please . Again and again . Please . Oh please . I rose to recite the Kaddish and there seemed to fall upon the room a dense curtain of silence in which I heard my voice with a startling clarity and heard too the responses of those around me . I thought my knees would buckle and wondered why the room was so cold . Outside I walked through the crowd and saw people still staring at me . I started home . Somewhere deep inside me the word please had nested and I kept hearing it all the way home . Please . Please . I heard it all that afternoon as I sat alone in the apartment waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing , which had taken place the day before , had gone badly . My mother had said something in the morning about Ellis Island and had rushed out of the apartment . 1She returned home ashen-faced . I heard the word please all through that hot July night and heard too strange words from my mother as she wandered through the apartment , talking out loud , singing softly , weeping . The next day we took the subway to Manhattan and sat hud/died together through the racketing , screeching ride . A cab brought us to the river . We stood a long time in the crowd on the pier . There were journalists and newspaper photographers in the crowd . A black four-door car pulled up . Two uniformed men climbed out of the car along with Jakob Daw . His wrists were shackled . A second car pulled up and Mr. Dinn stepped hurriedly out . He looked gray-faced , exhausted , unshaven . His dark suit was rumpled , his dark tie was awry , and his hat had a dent in its side . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jakob Daw craned his neck , scanning the crowd . He found us and raised his shackled hands . Flashbulbs popped . The two uniformed men took Jakob Daw quickly up the gangplankand into the ship . He looked back over his shoulder once again . Then he was gone . My mother and I stood with Mr. Dinn on the pier and watched the ship pull away . We scanned the decks for Jakob Daw but we could n't see him . Slowly the huge ship grew smaller and smaller . I felt my mother leaning heavily against me , felt all her weight upon me ; and thought I would fall . Mr. Dinn put his arm around her shoulders and drew her to him . The ship , white and luminous in the bright red afternoon sun , turned into the river and toward the distant Narrows . Would it sail past Sea Gate ? Would I have seen it from the cottage as it sailed on toward the horizon and the darkness of Europe ? We stood there watching the ship grow smaller and smaller until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun-washed water . The crowd had gone . We stood awhile longer , in silence , looking at the wide expanse of the river . Then we climbed into Mr. Dinn 's car and drove back to the apartment . It was cold that night . I woke and went through the dark apartment to my mother 's bed and climbed in beside her . Shep237stirred and said , " Michael ? Michael ? " then saw who it was and said , " We wo n't cry , darling . There 's too much to do . We will be very strong . " She clung to me and I felt her softness and the heat of her breasts and thighs . We slept huddled together . Once I woke and thought I heard whispering in the apartment but it was the wind in the trees . She took me to Prospect Park early the next morning and enrolledme in a city-sponsored summer program . She could not leave me alone in the apartment all day , she said , and she did not want me playing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the park . It was queer how cold I felt in spite of the sun that shone full upon my face . I jumped rope and played running games and had milk and cookies and played more games . The adults who took care of us looked to be in their early twenties . Before lunch we were taken out on the lake in boats and I put my hand in the water . Warm and silken . Why was I so cold ? It was odd how detached I felt from everything around me . I saw myself in the boat on the lake ; saw myself eating lunch , resting on a blanket in the shade of a tall sycamore , playing another game , then out on the lake again in a boat . There was a separate Ilana Davita Chandal watching the Ilana Davita Chandal who now sat in a boat rowed by a deeply tanned athletic-looking young man with brown hair and muscular arms and handsome features . The separate Ilana Davita Chandal saw in that boat , amidst four other girls , a thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and milk-white skin and bony shoulders that seemed bent beneath some intolerable burden . The girl , sitting in the stern , let her hand trail in the wake of the boat for a few minutes and then did a curious thing . She stood and stepped slowly out of the boat into the water . It all seemed to take a very long time : the girl rising to her feet , the boat lurching , the astonished look on the rower 's face as the girl simply walked off the boat and slid almost without a splash into the water , her dress ballooning up and covering her face , her hair billowing out behind her and then closing up like the petals of a flower as she sank . There were screams from thep238girls in the boat and shouts from the shore as the rower went into the water and brought the girl to the surface . How warm and smooth the water felt to the girl ! An embrace . " Never stand up in a boat ! " the rower was saying . " I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and calling her mother . Still it was cold . Still she was outside herself watching it happen , all the strained faces , all the noise , and the policeman writing things down . Her mother came with fresh clothes . A police car took them to the apartment . Ilana Davita Chandal lay in her bed shivering with cold and in the night entered her mother 's room and lay beside her mother and saw on the wall over their heads , in the moonlight that shone through the open window , the stallions on the beach and saw on two of the stallions her father and Jakob Daw , riding together . This she saw in the full and radiant clarity of her young imaginationand this she continued seeing through the ensuing days when she ceased talking and would not eat and shivered with cold and watched helplessly the growing horror on her mother 's face and then talked with doctors and nurses about the bird nesting in her door harp and the gray horse dead in the mountains and the witch Baba Yaga who had turned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too that one day one of the nurses was named Sarah and walked about the apartment in slippers and knelt in prayer by the side of Ilana Davita Chandal 's bed , murmuring , " 0 merciful God , giver of life and health ; bless , we pray Thee , Thy servant , Ilana Davita Chandal , and those who administer to her of Thy healing gifts ; that she may be restored to health of body and of mind ; through Jesus Christ our Lord . Amen . " From this nurse Ilana Davita Chandal took some food ; she let herself be bathed ; and the nurse permitted her to lie alone in the big bed in her mother 's room beneath the picture of the stallions on the beach . She would lie gazing up at the picture hour after hour , hearing the surf and the wind and the beating of the hooves . Nothing in the picture ever moved ; yet she could hear clearly even its faintest sounds . And then one day a long shiny gray car appeared at the curb inp239front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently helped Ilana Davita Chandal and the nurse named Sarah into thebackseat . Her mother stood on the curb with Mr. Dinn . Neighborsleaned out of windows , watching . Mr. Dinn said something to her through the open window of the car but she did not respond . Her mother leaned into the car and kissed her on the cheek . Cool and dry . Why was her mother crying ? The car drove away . They drove a long time . She slept and woke and slept again . They got out of the car and slept in a big white house . She dreamed a man and a woman came into her room in the night and stood gazing down at her . The next morning they drove on again . Ilana Davita Chandal continued seeing herself in her mother 's bedroom staring up at the picture of the beach and the racing stallions . The car drove onto a big boat and she became very frightened and cried and the nurse named Sarah calmed her . They slept on the boat and drove off onto shore and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow roads and old farmhouses and a startling blue sky patched with ragged clouds . And sitting in the backseat of the car , Ilana Davita Chandal caught glimpses of a distant sea beyond the hills and the farms . She felt herself curious about the odd names on the road signs : Five Houses , Dingwells Mills , Dundas , Little Pond . And then , exhausted , she slept and in her sleep again saw herself looking up at the picture of the red beach and the sea beyond and then felt herself rising in the bed , slowly standing , as she had stood in the rowboat , raising her arms carefully for balance and jumping lightly into the picture and marveling at the gritty feel of the sand beneath her feet and at the abrupt lurch into motion of the tranquillandscape within the frame , like the sudden jerking into life of a frozen motion-picture scene  --  wind on her face , surf on the beach , a gently rippling sea , and white birds circling and calling overhead . She woke and saw the nurse called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heavenly Father , we beseech Thee to have mercy upon all Thy children who live in mental darkness . Restorep240them to strength of mind . . . . " She closed her eyes . A cool hand gently caressed her face and forehead and stroked her hair . She tumbled into a deep sleep . Sunlight woke her , hot and brilliant . Aunt Sarah stood by the bed in her white nurse 's uniform and cap . " Thank you , Lord , " Ilana Davita Chandal heard her say . " Thank you , dear Jesus . " The air was warm . A wind blew through the open window , stirring the curtains . Beyond the window lay a red-sand beach , a vast sea , an infinite sky . Birds called in the distance . I looked up at my aunt . " Welcome , darling Davita , " she said softly . " Welcome . You slept nearly two days . You look so much better . Is n't it a marvelousday ? We 'll get you something to eat and we 'll go out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , Davita . We 're going to make you well . You 'll see . With the help of our Lord , we 're going to make you all well . " The nearest house stood about a quarter of a mile away on the crest of a low hill and was occupied by the farmer who leased and worked the land . I could see him working the land with two other men . But no one came near us all the weeks we were there save the mailman and the delivery boy from the nearby country store in Little Pond and a neatly attired young couple proselytizingfor Jehovah 's Witnesses . They left behind some copies of a magazine called The Watchtower . The farmhouse we lived in had been built by Aunt Sarah 's grandfather before the turn of the century . It was a small twostorywhite clapboard house with a dark gray shingle roof and dark gray shutters and a single massive gray stone step leading to the front door . There was an open wooden porch on the side of the house that faced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large grassy area that sloped toward the sandy beach and the water . The sea rolled gently onto the red land and onlyp241with the sudden changes of the tide would there be the rush of waves onto the beach and whitecaps upon the water . The land was so silent , save for the wind and the waves and the cries of the birds , that it seemed to have been formed by the wondrous magic of a dreamer of tales . For much of that month I sat on the porch and watched the tides . I saw the sea move slowly back and forth upon the red earth like some breathing creature of vast and mysterious dimensions . I saw the white birds circling above the beach , wide-winged terns , wheeling , calling . I watched the mists roll in from the sea and blur the hard edges of the land and turn all the world gauzy white . I saw sunsets beyond the house and low clouds bursting into flame . I sensed it all as unreal and knew I was inside a long dream from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields men rode horses and at times horses roamed loose on the land and grazed close to the beach . I could hear their occasional whinnying and from time to time saw them break into a gallop alongside the gentle surf . I thought I might see my father and Uncle Jakob on the horses , but I did not . I was often tired and slept at odd hours , sometimes dropping off abruptly in the midst of a sentence directed to Aunt Sarah and waking hours later alone in my bed in the dark and not knowing for a long moment where I was and thinking my father was at his desk doing his special writing or Jakob Daw was in his room in the circle of light cast by the lamp . The nights were so dark I could not see my hands . Stars burned in the sky , an infinite multitude of tiny blue-white fires in a black and boundless dome , and sometimes when I looked up at them I would burst into tears and Aunt Sarah would hold me and caress my face and pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God or Most Loving Father or to our Savior Jesus Christ or Jesus Christ our Lord . At first it was difficult for me to walk , I had lost so much weight and strength . When I woke in the mornings Aunt Sarah would help me dress and then lead me out of my room to thep242narrow second-floor landing and past the oval-framed sepia photographof a mother and daughter that hung on the wall at the head of the steep wooden stairway leading to the hallway downstairs . The hallway was small and narrow and brought us into the living room with its large fireplace and old chairs and sofa and , on its white walls , old pictures of a uniformed band and of a tall wavyhairedhandsome man in shining white knee-length stockings and tights holding a long pole and the same man rowing a long boat on a silvery lake , and a uniformed baseball team in front of a bannerthat read CHAMPIONS 1884 . In the living room Aunt Sarah would pray , her eyes closed , her head bowed , " 0 God , the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turnest the shadow of death into morning ; drive far from us all wrong desires , incline our hearts to keep Thy law , and guide our feet into the way of peace . . . . " She prayed before we ate and when we were done eating . She prayed when we witnessed a beautiful sunset , her longish face turned to the sky , her head arching back on her neck , her eyes pale blue in the light , " 0 Heavenly Father , who hast filled the world with beauty ; open , we beseech Thee , our eyes to behold Thy gracious hand in all Thy works . . . . " She prayed frequentlyfor my mother , " 0 God , whose fatherly care reacheth to the uttermost parts of the earth ; we humbly beseech Thee graciouslyto behold and bless those absent from us . . . . " She prayed at night before she turned off the light in my room , " 0 Lord , support us all the day long , until the shadows lengthen and the evening comes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life is over , and our work is done .... " Often when she prayed she knelt and I knelt with her and said amen when she was done . There was comfort in the kneeling and a sense of my exhausted self yielding to the embrace of a presence I could not understand but felt all about me as I did the wind and the sea . " We are a congregation of the Lord Jesus Christ , " my aunt said to me one evening as we sat watching the sun go down in a fiery sky . " You and I , darling Davita . We two out here alone . Our Lord hears us and sees us and comforts us , though we arep243only a congregation of two . How marvelous ! " I nodded and gazed at the setting sun and listened to the birds and the wind that blew in from the sea . Marvelous . Yes . And a comfort . Yes . Oh yes . All the furniture in the farmhouse was of dark wood . A wooden radio stood on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and distant static drifted from it and faded as if borne on puffs of wind . A telephone hung from the wall near the kitchen , a party line ; it rang infrequently and I never saw my aunt use it in all the time we were there . On occasion as we sat on the porch watching the sea , she would read to me or tell me a story . Mostly she told me stories of Jesus and Mary and the disciples . She told me about Jesus healing the sick and raising the dead , about Jesus crucified and resurrected , about Paul on the road to Damascus , about Jesus and the Second Coming . She told me local tales about Prince Edward Island : an Indian maiden so lovely that angels descended to earth to gaze upon her beauty ; an abandoned house occupied by mischievous elves ; a mysterious white trout that appeared suddenly in one of the island 's rivers ; mermaids in a lake , fireballs in the sky ; a phantomtrain , a phantom ship , a pirate 's treasure , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Maine , one of them about an ocean fog so thick that a man building a fish house nailed his roof to it . And she imitated the speech of Maine as she told the story : " We was shingling the fish house when it come in to fog , and I 'm telling you I never see just such a mull as that one . . . . " And when she said , " Next morning the fog lifted and carried my fish house out to sea , I was some put out . Worst fog I ever saw "  --  when she said that she threw back her head and laughed , and I heard in her laughter the sounds of my father 's voice . She loved telling me stories about healers and the power of faith and prayer . She told me of people given up for dead who were returned to health through prayer  --  through psalms and other passages from the Bible and prayers written by officials ofp244the Church . She herself had witnessed such events  --  in a clinic in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Spain . " In Him is life , " she said . " Darling Davita , when we pray we reach out to the source of all healing , we touch our Lord Jesus Christ . " Her car , a small black coupe , stood parked alongside the farmhouseand one Sunday morning we went on a long drive to a church . I remember a white one-story building with a tall white tower and a columned portico before its entrance . I sat next to Aunt Sarah on a wooden pew and followed the prayers and knelt when she knelt . An enormous cross hung on the wall behind the altar ; it frightened me . The church was crowded with worshippers , all looking stiff and restrained . The hymns were quietly sung . The walls and pews were painted white and there was a smell of moist raw earth in the air . I did not understand the sermonand fell asleep in the car on the way back and was very tired all the next day . Aunt Sarah did not take me to that church again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drawn-out and languorousdream . Slowly my strength returned . The warm sun , the vast and vaulting silence , the patient ministerings of my aunt  --  all was healing balm to me that month . And one afternoon I wandered off the porch by myself and went carefully across the grassy slope and down to the beach . I felt the sand on my feet , coarser than the sand of Sea Gate , and touched the water with my hands . Cool and calm and smooth . As far out as I could see were water and sky and horizon . How warm and sweet and clean all this wondrous ocean world ! I began to build a castle but after a while abandoned it . I was done with sand castles at the edge of the sea . I stood there a moment longer , looking out at the water and the wheeling birds . Then I turned and started back up the grassy slope to the farmhouseand saw Aunt Sarah watching me from the porch . Over supper that night we talked about my father and Jakob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Guernica and my aunt said it was terrible but there were many horrors perpetratedby the Communists and I told her what I had heard Uncle Jakob say about Barcelona and she said she was not surprised , nothing anyone said about that war could ever surprise herp245again . I asked her why she had gone to Spain and she said , " Dear child , I am a nurse for our Lord Jesus Christ . I go wherever there is suffering . " I asked her how someone who believed in Jesus Christ could work for the Communist side and she said something about this being an unredeemed world and a terrible centuryand sometimes a person had to choose between evils . " And nothing in our century is more evil than fascism , though communismcomes very close . " " My mother does n't like to hear people talk like that , " I said . " I pray to our Lord that your mother will one day come to her senses . " " Why did my father have to try to save the nun ? He could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She looked away from me and out across the beach to the sea . How like my father she was , a mirror of his gestures and features . But they were wrong on her , wrong on a woman , and she was not pretty . " I loved my brother , " she said , staring out at the sea . " He was one of the most decent people I have ever known . I pray that by that act he redeemed his immortal soul . " I did not understand , but was suddenly tired and did not ask her to explain . My mother wrote often . She was well and working very hard . She missed me terribly . How fortunate I was to be away from the city . The weather was very nearly unbearable ; even the nights were hot . Mr. Dinn kept asking about me . David was back from Sea Gate . He sent his good wishes and asked if I thought my school would still be boring next year and did I want to go to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea journey had been uncomfortable and the French had received him gladly and Paris was lovely as long as you did not talk too much about the war in Spain and the disastrous Communist cause . How was I feeling ? She had received a letter from Aunt Sarah saying that much of my old strength was back and there was some color in my face again and my weight was up and I was able to sleep nights without too many bad dreams . The letter had made herp246very happy . She was eager to see me but I should let Aunt Sarah decide when I was well enough to return . She sent me and Aunt Sarah her deepest love . In the last week of August it rained two straight days and nights . I lay in my bed at night and listened to the rain on the windows and roof of the farmhouse and thought I heard whisperingin the living room downstairs . Then the sky cleared and the sun shone and we began to take short automobile rides to nearby villages . I saw horse-driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skeletons of old cars in grassy meadowsand , in a coastal village , lobster boats tied to old wooden docks and bobbing lightly in the sun-speckled sea . We went on longer and longer rides through villages from another time , past red-sand dunes and long beaches to a coast where the sea was wild . And one afternoon we stood on a cliff near stunted , oddly shaped dead trees and watched the sea roll against a shoreline of jagged rocks , saw the wind-blown swells that were the juncture of two colliding tides crashing and boiling with furiousviolence , and I was awed and a little frightened . One day Aunt Sarah took me to the nearby farmhouse and I met the farmer . He was a large , taciturn man . I saw his pigs and cows and rode one of his horses . He showed me how to sit in the saddle like a girl , how to hold the reins , how to bring the horse to a halt . It was a young horse . I rode slowly with my heart thumpingin my ears , feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful flanks . I smelled its heat and saw the quivering motionsof its muscular skin and held its mane and felt the air on my face . When the farmer helped me from the saddle I felt I had grown wings for a long moment and flown . That night I fell asleep to the sounds of the radio and dreamed of the stallions on the beach and saw my father and Jakob Daw on two of the horses , riding toward the sea and the darkening horizon . In all the time I was on that beach I did not once dream of Baba Yaga . The next day I woke early and dressed and went down the steep stairway into the living room . Aunt Sarah sat on the couch , read/ing . We prayed together , thanking the Heavenly Father for our health and our rest . Then we ate breakfast and sat on the porch , watching the birds and the sea . When the air grew warm we put on bathing suits and went into the water . The sea was shallow for a long way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Sarah was bony and small-breasted and seemed a little ashamed of her body . She waded out to knee-deep water and then stood watching me swim . Later we came out of the water and put on clothes and sat on the porch . Aunt Sarah wore a light flowery dress and a broad-brimmed hat . She appeared calm , her long thin body slouched in a lazy curve against the back of the beach chair . She looked very like my father then , and I found myself stealing frequentglances at her . Shortly before noon a long shiny gray car came down the macadamroad toward the sea and turned into the dirt road that led to the farmhouse . A man in uniform stepped out . " Good morning , William , " Aunt Sarah called cheerfully , getting to her feet . " Did you have a pleasant drive ? We shall be starting shortly . How are Mother and Father ? " I sat looking at the sea and listening to the wind and the wheeling birds . I imagined horses on the beach galloping and turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand . After lunch Aunt Sarah and I knelt in the living room and thanked the Merciful God for the summer and for our health . Then we closed up the farmhouse and climbed into the car and drove away . I returned to school . I sat in the classroom , numbed by vacant hours . No one talked to me . I could hear classmates whispering about me as I went by in the corridors . One morning a hall monitorput his hands on my chest and squeezed and said , " Grapes , " and laughed hideously . My dreams began to return . Letters came from Jakob Daw but I would not read them . I did not return to the synagogue . On occasion my mother would come into my room and findp248me kneeling in prayer . Mr. Dinn was often in the apartment , almost always in the late evenings . David came once and heard me describe my weeks in the farmhouse with my aunt and did not come again . I saw Ruthie often but we did not play together . One day I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haze through the neighborhood and then returned to the school a few minutes before the end of class . There was a big fuss about that . I remember long talks with my mother and Mr. Dinn . I remember the leaves beginning to turn and the cold in the evening air . I remember coming upon my mother in the kitchen one night and seeing her at the table , her head in her hands . She was crying . She did not see me and I walked quietly away . Again I wandered from my school and now my mother was called and we sat together in an office with a short , bald man who peered at us from behind a dark-wood desk on which papers were arranged in orderly piles . I asked him , " Is that your special writing ? " They stared at me . My mother looked ill . I knelt by my bed and prayed that night and dreamed , for the first time in many weeks , of Baba Yaga . I was on the dirt road that led to the farmhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped out , Baba Yaga , and stood there , one foot on the stone step , one foot on the threshold . Then she laughed and leaped through the air and fell upon me . I woke screaming and my mother was quickly in the room . I remember a long night in the kitchen with my mother and Mr. Dinn , but I can not recall what was said . I remember a long talk with Mr. Helfman in the backyard near the sycamore and the bed of fading flowers . I remember long conversations with a kindly bearded man in a small musty room whose walls were lined from floor to ceiling with books . I sat in a classroom amidst new faces and listened to a young clean-shaven man speak softly about a Jewish scholar named Rambam , who had lived hundreds of years ago in Spain . Spain was a very important country for the Jews , the teacher said . Didp249anyone know what was going on now in Spain ? I raised my hand . " liana , " he said gently . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if I had never spoken before in all the years of my life ; as if I had never uttered words before in all the classrooms I had attended . Faces turned to me . The teacher stood behind his desk , listening.  |p253That  fall my mother left her job in Manhattan and began to work for an agency in downtown Brooklyn a few blocks from the East River and the Brooklyn Bridge . She felt she ought to be closer to home , she said . She did n't want me staying alone too long after school . And she was tired of having to travel day after day to Manhattan . I heard her tell Mr. Dinn that Manhattan reminded her too much of my father . What point was there to her being endlessly haunted by her dead husband ? she said . I wandered into my mother 's bedroom one afternoon and opened my father 's closet . The strong rose-petal fragrance of a sachetrose to my nostrils . My father 's clothes and shoes were gone . Even the clothes hangers were no longer there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  was shocking and sent through me a coldness that made the back of my neck tingle . The carton with my father 's special writing was still on the floor near the bed ; and the picture of the horses on the beach still hung on the wall . But I was haunted by the vision of that empty closet . My mother told me that she had given all of my father 's clothes and shoes to the poor . Mr. Dinn had taken care of it . What point was there to having my father 's clothes and shoes moldering in the closet ? she said . There were poor and hungry people everywherewho needed clothes and shoes . " Are you very upset , Ilana ?  |p254I  'm sorry . I did it while you were with Aunt Sarah . There are betterways to remember your father than by the suits and shoes he wore . " But each time I recited the Kaddish I would remember the look of his clothes . And I was saying it every day now , for we prayed in class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two studentswho rose at intervals and recited the Hebrew words , " Yisgadalv'yiskadash shmai rabboh ... " After the first morning my teacher , a kindly bearded man in his middle forties , had asked me to remain behind as the class trooped out for the morning recess . When we were alone , he said , " Iiana , a girl does not say Kaddish . " I did not respond . " I was told that you say Kaddish in shul . I can not do anything about that . But you will not say it in my class . " I said nothing . " Is that understood , Ilana ? " I nodded . He dismissed me . The next morning I rose during the morning service and quietly recited the Kaddish . I felt the teacher 's burning eyes upon me , felt all their eyes , staring . But he said nothing to me about it again , and after a few days there were no more stares . All uttered the necessary responses at the appropriate places . Then one day the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I stood alone , saying the words  --  " Magnified and sanctified be the great name of God . . . "  --  and still all responded . I found as the weeks went by and winter approached that my mother had been right : I was no longer clearly remembering the look and cut of my father 's clothes . At times I could not even recallhis face . My mother said that was natural ; but it frightened me to be losing my memory of my father . I saw David often . He was a class ahead of me . I would see him in the company of his friends in the corridors or the yard . Sometimeswe would talk briefly alone together . Mostly he remained in the circle of his friends . He had an extraordinary reputation in thep255school . All seemed awed by his brilliance . And because the whole school knew by now that his father and my mother were first cousins , I was treated as if I belonged intimately to his family and shared in the aura of high intellect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyalties . I realized quickly enough that no one in my class snickered or whispered or laughed when I raised my hand to ask or to answer a question , to react to a book we had been told to read , or to make a point about the opera at the Metropolitan or the exhibition of paintings at the Brooklyn Museum which the school took us to see during the first semester I was there . There was much gossip and idle talk among the students ; but no one in this school laughed at learning . The school day was divided in half : Hebrew and religious studiesin the morning , English and secular studies in the afternoon . I was in my regular fourth-grade class in the afternoon ; but , because my Hebrew was so poor , I had been placed in the second grade for the morning hours . Ruthie , who was in my afternoon class , and Mr. Helfman , who taught sixth grade , tutored me after school hours in Hebrew . I felt myself floating and gliding and flying through this school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the corridors and no one put his hands on your chest and squeezed and yelled , " Grapes ! " and no one called you a Commie Jew shit to your face . I was busy with my studies , and my mother was busy with her work . She seemed always to be doing something : reading , cleaning , washing , cooking , writing , attending meetings , talking with Mr. Dinn , studying with the two men and the woman who continuedcoming to our apartment on Sunday afternoons . She went to bed long after I did and woke long before . In all the months of that fall and early winter I do not remember ever seeing her rest during the day . We would leave the apartment together in the morning and walk to Eastern Parkway and then go our separate ways , she to work and I to school . The mail arrived after we left and I would hurry home from school and use the duplicate mailbox key myp256mother had given me . But the letters we waited for did not come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jakob Daw had not written us in weeks . Where was he ? And was Aunt Sarah back in Spain ? In December there was a Chanukkah assembly in the school in the same large room where people prayed on Saturdays and holidays . The dividing ninon wall had been removed . A tall plywood wall stood before the ark , separating it from the room . Boys and girls sat together and one of the boys in the eighth grade chanted the blessings and lit the first candle . Another boy delivered a brief talk about the courage of the Maccabees and the miracle of the lights . " The few prevailed against the many , " he said , " because they had faith in the Ribbono Shel Olom . " During supper that night I asked my mother if we could light Chanukkah candles in our house . She said no , she did n't believe in it . " But they 're so pretty , Mama . And they remind me of when Papa was here last year . " " No , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hands sending you to the yeshiva . All I need is for someone in my section to pass by our window and see Chanukkah candles burning . " I had not realized that by going to a religious school I was endangeringher position in the party . Yes , she said . There had been a hearing . She had been given the opportunity to offer a lengthy explanation . She had reminded them of the price our family had already paid for the cause . They had listened courteously . There had been a few sarcastic remarks . The hearing had ended with no official action being taken . I did not ask my mother again . Instead I would walk down to Ruthie 's apartment just before supper and watch Mr. Helfman light the candles . Then I would go upstairs and have supper with my mother . I knew little of what was happening now in Spain . I no longer read newspapers and only occasionally glanced at a headline . Ip257knew the Fascists were winning the war . I did not want to hear anything more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work carrying a cartonfilled with house plants . She distributed the plants throughout the apartment , placing them on windowsills and tables where they could catch the sunlight . " We need some green life in this apartment , " she said . " How did we go all these years without plants in the house ? Are n't they pretty ? And inexpensive . Would you like one for your room , Ilana ? " She attended rallies in Manhattan and party meetings in Brooklyn . On occasion groups of people would come to our apartment , quiet , serious men and women about my mother 's age , and they would sit for hours in the living room and have long discussions and listen to her lectures . There was no drinking at those meetings , no rowdiness . How the door harp played to the comings and goings of those people on those nights ! I asked my mother who the people were . They were writers and artists and theater people , she said . " Do n't they sing ? " " I promised Mrs. Helfman there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss the singing . " " So do I , " she said . " There are many things I miss now , Ilana . What can we do ? " One night after a long meeting of that group I woke and came out of my room and went along the hallway . The apartment was dark , the air rancid with tobacco smoke . I wanted a glass of water and started into the kitchen , when I noticed that the door to my mother 's room was slightly ajar . Light streaming out of her room cut a sharp wedge into the hallway darkness . I moved toward the door and put my hand on the knob . Then I stopped and remained very still , peering into the room through the narrow opening of the door . My mother stood naked before the full-length mirror that was attached to the door of her closet . I had never seen her entirelyp258naked before . The mirror magnified the ceiling light and sent it cascading upon her as she turned her body slowly this way and that , keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely smooth white nakedness of her , saw her slender arms and curving shoulders and the flat planes of her shoulder blades and the curvingindentation of her spinal column and the deep cleavage between the rounded buttocks . I glimpsed from the side the round firm fleshiness of her left breast and , in the long mirror , saw all the golden fullness of her body , breasts and nipples and belly and the clump of triangular darkness that sent a shiver through me . She was fondling her breasts , stroking the nipples with the palms of her hands , slowly , an expression of rapt concentration on her pale and lovely face , her eyes nearly shut , her mouth open and her tongue pressing tightly upon her upper lip ; then rubbing the nipples , gently , with her index fingers and thumbs , gently and slowly , rubbing . The nipples were dark and hard , her body rigid , her back slightly arched . She stood there in front of the mirror , rocking slowly back and forth . Then , slightly parting her legs , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard her say , in a long drawn-out whisper and in a voice I barely recognized . " Michael ... " I took a silent step back and then another and was in the dark hallway . I turned slowly and put my hand on the wall and went carefully back to my room . I lay on my bed in the darkness and kept seeing my mother naked before the mirror in her room . I knew that image would always remain with me , deep inside me , and return to my eyes at odd and unexpected times ; like the image of the gang leader offering protection to a little girl with a penny in her hand ; like the image of the boy with the cigarette asking , You Jewish ? ; like my father 's face when he threw back his head and laughed ; like the veiled look in my mother 's eyes when she drifted into the past ; like Jakob Daw bent over his desk , writing ; like the sadness in the dark eyes of the little girl named Teresa ; like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea Gate ; like the birds that called hoo hoo hoo hoo ; ; like Aunt Sarah on her kneesp259in our spare room ; like the candles of Chanukkah in the Helfman apartment ; like the black bird and the gray horse and Baba Yaga . Images of a childhood . My mother naked . Would my body look like that one day ? Ripe and round and lovely , the boniness and angularity smooth and soft , and the forest of darkness between my legs ? I barely slept that night and in the morning could not look directly into my mother 's eyes when she spoke to me . " Are you feeling all right ? " she asked . I nodded . I kept imagining her naked body beneath her dress . In school I fell asleep in class and was gently wakened by my teacher , who put his hand on my forehead and wanted to know if I felt ill . The weather turned cruel . Frozen snow lay crystal white upon the trees and grimy upon the sidewalks and streets . Cars moved cautiously across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the night to the creaks and groans of the ice-laden trees that lined our street : eerie sounds that came through my window and seemed to inhabit the shadows in my room . One Saturday afternoon in January my mother and I walked to Prospect Park . It was a cold blue windless day . The lake was frozen . Skaters glided across its smooth white surface . I stood at its edge with my mother and imagined myself stepping out of the rowboat into the water . Why had I done that ? I could not imagineever feeling bad enough to want to do that . And what if I had drowned ? What if I had not been found ? How deep was the lake ? Would I now be somewhere in its depths , frozen to ice ? Walking with me along the frozen paths beneath the bare trees , my mother said the lake reminded her of the river where she had lived as a child . In the winters they had to break the ice to keep a channel open for the barges and ferries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had not ice-skated for a long time and probably could no longer do it . I asked her where she had gone to school.  | " In Vienna . " " No , before Vienna . " " In a little Jewish school near where I was born . It was run by a cruel old teacher who did n't like teaching girls . He taught us to read the prayerbook . " " Did your father study with you ? " " My father did n't do anything with me . My grandfather taught me Bible and Mishnah and a little Gemora , and my mother taught me Polish and German . " " Would your father be angry if he was alive and knew I was going to a yeshiva ? " " I do n't know how my father would feel about that , " my mother said . " I do n't know very much about my father . He was almost never home . Probably he would be angry . Yes , I think he would be very angry . He did n't believe girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely because your father was n't home ? " " Yes . So was I. My mother once told me that terrible mistakes are sometimes made in the name of loneliness . If not for my grandfather  --  " She broke off , suddenly lost in some memory . " I wish your grandfather was still alive . " " So do I , " my mother said . " But he 's not . Shall we start back ? I 'm beginning to feel cold . " On Eastern Parkway , a block from our s'reet , we met David and his father . They had been visiting a friend and were on their way to the synagogue for the afternoon and evening services . I walked with David . My mother and Mr. Dinn walked on ahead . " It 's really cold , " David said . " Are n't you cold ? " His face was red and he spoke through stiffened lips . " I hate this weather . " " David , did you study the Mishnah Brochos ? " " Sure . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't understand . " " What ? " We walked carefully on the icy streets beneath the black frozenp261trees , talking . Long shadows of buildings and trees lay upon the parkway . I listened to David , watched the dancing of his hands as he talked about words and ideas , listened to the high eagerness in his voice , saw the dark fires in his eyes . He was a little taller than I , and very thin . I wondered if he and his father had a housekeeper who cared for them . How did they live ? We continued along the street behind my mother and his father , talking about some problems I was having with Hebrew . After a while I began to invent problems ; I liked watching him talk . My mother took me to a neighborhood movie theater that eveningand we saw a detective story and a love story . The love story seemed very long . More and more my mother went to such movies , either with me or alone . I liked the detective story and thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ponderouslyor breathed so heavily as the actors in those love stories . Sometimes we took the subway into Manhattan to see a Russianmovie , but my mother seemed increasingly uneasy about travelingto Manhattan . Manhattan reminded her too much of my father ; certain streets caused searing pain . She would travel on party business to rallies and meetings ; but that was all . By the middle of that winter , less than ten months after my father 's death , we were no longer going together to Manhattan . Yet she seemed tenaciously loyal to my father 's memory . Often in the evenings I would see her at the desk in her room carefully going through the carton of my father 's special writing : magazine articles , newspapers , journals , typescripts . My father had become a hero of sorts to a certain segment of the political world and , at the invitation of a small New York publisher , my mother was preparinga book-length collection of his serious work . And she was , at the same time , translating into English one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lived with us . He had left those stories with my mother . One cold Saturday night in February we saw a movie in which a young woman was attacked and badly hurt by two men . Nothingp262of the brutality was shown ; the gaps were left to the imagination . Afterward my mother came out of the theater and hurried away as if I were not there . I had to run to keep up with her . Later in our warm kitchen she said to me , as I sat over milk and cookies , " I had no idea it was such a movie . I 'm sorry , Ilana . " " I liked it , Mama . " " Did n't it frighten you ? " " Yes . But it was a good story . " " They show movies like that to make money , " she said . " They are capitalist exploiters of the working class . They should tell people in advance if such things are in a movie . Please finish your milk , Ilana , and go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her cup of coffee , a dark brooding in her eyes . Very late that night , as I lay on the edge of sleep , she came into my room and stood near my bed . She placed the palm of her hand on my cheek . I felt her caressing me , her fingers smooth and hot . Then she bent to kiss me . Her face was wet . I heard the beating of my heart and was certain she heard it too . After a moment she straightened and went silently from the room . On occasion Mr. Dinn would come to visit , always at night and always remaining after I went to bed . From my room I could hear them talking in the kitchen . He never ate or drank anything in our house , save a glass of water or soda , because we did not observe the laws of kashruth . I did n't like that : it was strange having a guest in your house who refused to eat or drink there . Once I heard him raise his voice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , open your eyes and look at what he 's doing . Those trials are n't a travesty ? The country is drenched in blood . Their constitution is a mockery and their laws are a joke . The man is a murderous barbarian ! " And I heard too my mother 's querulous reply . " He is transforming a backward country overnight , Ezra . I trust him . Whom do you want me to trust ? DuPont ? Generalp263Motors ? John D. Rockefeller ? You know how they treat their workers . You know how they are all tied to I. G. Farben and the Fascists . Talk about barbarians ! The capitalist is the true barbarian , but in a fancy suit ! " " Why do you judge socialism by its dreams and capitalism by its deeds ? Is that fair , Channah ? Is it logical ? " " Ezra , I judge both by their deeds . Fascism is the dictatorship of finance capitalism . If I must choose between the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and the dictatorship of the proletariat , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen Mr. Dinn helped me with my Hebrewhomework and seemed surprised at how quickly I was learningthe language . " My mother was like that , " he said . " So was mine , " said my mother . " Did your father also never stay at home ? " I asked . He gave my mother a quick glance and looked back at me . " My father was home . " " What did your father do ? " " He owned a clothing factory . " " Is he alive ? " " No . He died when I was nineteen . " " You had ten more years of your father than I did . " The two of them glanced at each other and said nothing . " Did you hate your father for dying ? " He looked surprised . " No . I was angry . But I did n't hate him . " " Sometimes I think I hate my father . " " Ilana , " my mother said softly . " He did n't have to try to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why did he try to save that nun ? " " Your father was a kind and generous man , " Mr. Dinn said . " A gallant man . He saw a woman in danger and wanted to help her . " " He should n't have , " I said . They looked at me and were quiet . " I 'm tired , " I said , after a moment . " I think I 'll go to bed now . "  |p264I  felt them looking at me as I collected my books and went from the kitchen . Ruthie told me the next evening that she was having trouble with the composition our class had been assigned to write . I helped her with it ; she helped me with my Hebrew homework . She was a serious but poor student and seemed to have difficulty remembering things . " I wish I had your memory , " she said . " You remember every-thing . " " Sometimes that 's not so good , Ruthie . " " How far back can you remember ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I remember when I was three my parents came home from a demonstration . They were all bloody . Policemen on horses hit them with sticks . My mother kept screaming about Cossacks . I remember that . " " You remember to the age of three ? " " I wish I could forget that . I wish I could forget all the differenttimes we moved until we moved here . Have you lived here all your life ? " " Yes . " " You 're lucky . This is a nice house . It looks a little like a castle . " " It does ? " " And you have a backyard with grass and flowers and a porch , and there 's even a park and a museum nearby . " " My father wo n't let me go to the museum . He says it has picturesthat are n't decent . Mr. Dinn likes our house . He once wanted to live upstairs where you live now , but his wife liked the other apartment better , so they did n't move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other before they were married . I heard Mama tell Papa they once were in love , but he would n't marry your mother because she did n't believe in religion and was a Communist . Why did your mother become a Communist ? " " I do n't know . "  | " I 'll bet Mr. Dinn knows . He 's a smart man . He knows every-thing . " " He did n't know how to keep the Fascists in the American governmentfrom sending Jakob Daw back to Europe . " " Papa said Mr. Daw would n't let him do anything . " " He should 've done something anyway . Smart people know how to do something even when they ca n't . " " Papa says if you tell your lawyer not to do anything , the lawyer  --  " " They 're all ending up in Europe , and they 're all going to end up dead . Jakob Daw is in Europe and he does n't write us anymore . And my Aunt Sarah is in Europe and she does n't write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's a nurse and a Christian missionary . She tries to make everybody believe in Jesus Christ . " " Do n't say that word ! " " Which word ? " " You know . " " Jesus Christ ? " " Do n't say it , Ilana ! Papa told me you 're not supposed to say his name . If you do n't say his name it means he does n't exist . " " I do n't understand . " " That 's what Papa told me . " " But why ca n't we say it ? " " Papa said that Christians believe that he 's their God and that the Jews killed him . " I stared at her . " I do n't remember that in any of the stories Aunt Sarah told me . We killed him ? " " Papa said that Christians have been killing Jews for thousands of years because they say we killed their God . " " I do n't understand . " " I do n't , either , " Ruthie said . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during supper that night . " They accuse Jews of crucifying Jesus , " she said , and explainedp266the meaning of the word crucify . I had never thought to associate the crucifixes I saw on Christians with a slow and horrible kind of execution . " All of Europe believed it in the past and most of Europeprobably believes it today . It 's one of the ways the capitalists and the Church control the working class  --  by turning them against the Jews . That 's the true reason Jews are hated . And that 's the true reason for all the pogroms . " She explained the meaning of the word pogrom . " An organized killing of Jews . It 's a Russian word . " " I think Ruthie told me about that once . Were you ever in a pogrom ? " " Yes . " " Were your parents in it too ? " " My mother and my grandfather were in it . My father was with the rebbe . Please , Ilana , let 's not talk about it any more tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homework . " Later I lay awake in my bed and listened to the howling wind . Ice cracked and snapped and tumbled from the trees . After a while I fell asleep . There was a heavy rain that night and toward morningit turned to sleet and fell with an irregular drumbeat upon the street . In the pale light of morning a film of gleaming crystalwhiteice lay upon the street and clung to the trunks and branches of the trees . It seemed as if the lake had overflowed and now coveredall the neighborhood . I walked carefully to school on the ice . In March a letter arrived from Jakob Daw , written in German . My mother read it to me . Paris was cold , wet . His flat on the rue des Solitaires was small and damp . He could see from his bedroom window the chimney pots of the Nineteenth Arrondissement and the little rivers of rain on the narrow streets below . France was glutted with right-wing exultation and left-wing despair over the Fascist victories in Spain . Now and then he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had seen Picasso 's Guernica . It was a knife in thep267heart of the human species that would turn and turn forever . He himself was weary and dispirited but still writing . On cold nights in his flat he remembered their days together in Vienna , and that warmed him . The cough was bad . He thought he might go south to a warmer climate . Perhaps Marseilles . How was Ilana Davita ? " Please tell her the bird still nests in our harp . Do not ask her what it means . It is between me and your lovely daughter . FrequentlyI run across someone who remembers Michael . It is astonishinghow many people came to know him during his months in Spain . Now I am tired and will lie down and rest . Jakob Daw . " We were in the living room . My mother sat very quietly on the sofa , looking at Jakob Daw 's letter . " Mama ? " " Yes , darling . " " Why did your father let you go to Vienna ? " She colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I went to Vienna to study . " " But why did your father let you go ? " " My mother wanted me to go . " " And your father ? " " He wanted me to go too . " " Mama , was it a bad pogrom ? " She hesitated . " There are no good pogroms , Ilana . " " But was it very bad ? " " Yes , " she said , after a moment . " Did the Russian soldiers hurt you ? " " Yes . They hurt me and they killed my sister . " " I did n't know you had a sister . " " I had two sisters . One died of pneumonia , the other was  --  she was killed ; she was killed by those Russian soldiers . So was my grandfather . He tried to stop them from hurting me and my sister , and they killed him . " She gazed out the window at the late afternoon winter light . " Is it snowing again ? What a long winterp268this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A father should protecthis daughters , do n't you think ? A father should n't leave that to a grandfather . My grandfather was an old man . He tried to help us , and a Russian soldier shot him . Then they left us in the forest and my mother and I came back to the town . It was my mother 's idea that I go to Vienna . " " But why did your father let you go ? " " He was ashamed to have me in the house . " I stared at her . " They hurt me very badly , Ilana . " I was quiet . We sat together awhile in silence . My mother broke the silence . She said , looking down at the letter in her hand , " The years in Vienna were beautiful . It took a long time for the bad memories to begin to fade even a little . Jakob Daw helped me . Then he went to war and was hurt . This is a terrible century , Ilana . So many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Russian government was overthrown . How I hated those soldiers ! I remember one of them wore a cross on top of his tunic , and when he  --  when he  --  " She broke off for a moment , and then continued . " When I came back home to my parentsfrom Vienna , it was impossible to live with my father . Then my mother died of influenza , and I came to America . " " Did you become a Communist in Europe ? " " No . Your father introduced me to that after we met . I stopped being religious when I lived in Vienna . But I was not very political . I wanted to be a writer , an  --  an intellectual . How pretentious that sounds ! But I would have become political soon enough . You ca n't be an intellectual in Europe and not be political . Do you understand any of this , Ilana ? I think you understand enough . Look at the snow ! And so late in March ! " " Is that why you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father ? " " That and other things . It made a slave of my mother . " " Not everyone is like your father . Mr. Helfman is n't . Mr. Dinn isn't. "  | " I only know my own life , Ilana . In my life there was my father , not Mr. Dinn or Mr. Helfman . You ca n't forget the bad things that are done to you by telling yourself that the world is n't all bad . We really can know only the people and things that touch us . Everything else is like words in a dictionary . We can learn them but they do n't live deep inside us . Can you understand that , Ilana ? " " I think so . " " Religion is a dangerous fraud , Ilana , and an illusion . It preventspeople from seeing the truth and expressing their discontent , and sometimes it inflames the heart so that people followhorrible ideas like fascism . " " But I like my school and the shul . " " I know you do , darling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's very important . It 's fine to learn the grammar and the words and the stories and to be with people . It 's very important to be with people , Ilana . You do n't have to believe in God in order to understand a verse in the Bible or a passage from the Talmud . You can study it as literature . You can learn how the Jews were oppressed the way so many other people were and still are . It 's all right that you like the school and the shul , Ilana . " " I especially like the shul . " " Yes . I know . " " I like the singing . " She said nothing . " I do n't like the wall in the middle . " She grimaced but was quiet . " Mama , David said the law is that you 're supposed to stop sayingKaddish after eleven months . " " I know , " she said . " Will you come to shul with me the last time I say Kaddish ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shul . I have n't been in a shul in almost fifteen years . Are you done with your homework , Ilana ? Yes ? Then I think you can help me make supper . " I went alone to the synagogue that Saturday morning . Mr.p270Dinn led the service . The synagogue was crowded and warm and filled with the rhythms and songs of the service . Afterward I returnedhome and heard the singing of the door harp . I found my mother in the living room , rereading the letter from Jakob Daw . That week my mother completed her work on my father 's book . The day after she journeyed into Manhattan to deliver the manuscript to the publisher , she was invited by another publisher to write an introduction to a collection of the stories of Jakob Daw , some of which were to be translated by her . She seemed a little dazed by that and immediately sent off a letter to Jakob Daw . She began to work far into the nights on that book . I wondered when she slept . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the bathroom and the light would still be burning in her room . Once she fell asleep at the kitchen table during supper and I woke her because I was afraid she would fall off the chair . She opened her eyes with a start and spoke some words in a language I did not understand . Then she looked at me and smiled shamefacedly and asked if I had finished my homework and would I help her with the dishes . She had always been neat and caring about her housework , save for the few months that had followed our move to this apartment . Clothes were meticulously folded , beds carefully made , floors swept and washed , corners dusted free of cobwebs , shades raised to the same level in each window , books arranged in straight lines on their shelves , newspapers set down in their separate piles on the living room coffee table , street clothes and shoes placed in orderly fashion in our closets . My father had been the careless one in our family and had gone about leaving trails of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen and bathroom , magazines on the floor of the living room , books face down on the kitchen table , pages of his writing strewn about the bedroom ; once I found a small packet of some sort in the bathroomp271sink and brought it to my mother and she blushed scarlet and said it belonged to my father . Now she became strangely uncaring about the apartment , Books , magazines , and newspapers lay strewn about everywhere . I found her underwear beneath the bathroom sink , kitchen towels in the living room , an unopened bar of laundry soap on her desk , one of her berets on the hallway floor , a box labeled Kotex on the bookcase in her bedroom . She would wear the same dress three or four days in a row . She had taken to wearing house slippers in the apartment and shuffled about in a way that reminded me of Aunt Sarah . And she began to put on weight : I found her late one night in the living room letting out one of her dresses . She looked embarrassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a father . I asked her about that one day that spring and she laughed in a high nervousway and said she was n't thinking about that , no man could ever take the place of my real father . She was busy , very busy . People continued coming to the apartment for meetings ; the two men and the woman kept showingup on Sundays for the study sessions on the writings of Karl Marx ; she went out to meetings , worked at the agency , labored over the collection of Jakob Daw 's stories . Yet a strange sort of leadenness had settled upon her ; a shadow had entered her eyes . At odd moments  --  at night before I turned off my light ; in the morning on Eastern Parkway as we were about to go our separate ways ; on early Saturday afternoons just as I got back from the synagogue  --  shewould suddenly embrace me and cling to me suffocatinglyand kiss my face with her cool , dry lips . The frantic quality of those embraces frightened me a little . One Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kaddish for my father for the last time . I pronounced each word with care , my eyes closed so I would not be distracted . All around me women uttered the appropriate responses . As I left the synagogue I thought I saw the pale , haunted face of my mother . Then the face was gone into the crowd . I came outsidep272and threaded my way quickly through the mass of people milling about in front of the building and looked up and down Eastern Parkway . I saw no one who resembled my mother . I ran to the corner where I normally turned off the parkway and saw a woman in my mother 's brown coat hurrying up the side street . I ran and came alongside her and it was my mother . I took her hand . Her skin was hot and dry . We walked in silence together back to the apartment . That night I woke and listened to her crying and lay quietly in my bed and let my own tears come too . Mr. Dinn 's visits became more frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoying to have him sitting at the table in our kitchen and never eating anything and drinking only water or soda out of a glass . Always he came in a suit and a tie and a hat , and would take off his jacket and hat only at my mother 's insistence . In place of his hat he would wear a small dark velvet skullcap . Sometimes he would remove his vest and loosen his tie . He was a tall , angular man , loose-jointed , with strong , bony features , a smooth , prominent forehead , and a jutting Adam 's apple whose up-and-down dancing movements above the knot of his tie fascinatedme . His deep baritone voice would echo throughout the apartment and often woke me long after I had fallen asleep . He seemed comfortable in our apartment and it was clear that my mother was at ease in his presence . One Saturday night he came to the apartment and he and my mother went out together . " We 're only going to a movie , " she had said to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silent rooms , opening closets and drawers . My father 's closet echoed with emptiness . The only object in it now was the carton of his special writing . I bent down and opened the carton ; it was filled with magazines and newspapers and pages of typescript . A notebook lay on top of the pages , small and with hard dark cardboard covers . I held it and carefully opened it and saw on its first page , in the handwriting of Jakobp273Daw , the words Eine Geschichte . I turned the pages slowly . The writing was in a language I could not read . I replaced the notebookin the carton and went from the room . I was in bed when they returned . The door harp sang in the hallway . They went into the kitchen . My mother laughed softly at something Mr. Dinn said . It was a lovely sound , high and girlish . I had not heard her laugh in a long time . My mother left the apartment early the next morning and took the subway into Manhattan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May , one week after Passover . We had not observed the festival ; and my mother had politely but resolutely turned down Mrs. Helfman 's invitation to their Seder . " I do n't really believe in it , " she had said to me afterward . " And there are too many memories of Sedorim when my father was with the rebbe instead of being with us . Why should I sit at the Helfmans ' Seder and spoil their night with my bad memories ? " " David and his father will be there . " " We wo n't , " she said . " I do n't need it . I have enough memoriesfor now . " Her color was high , her mood buoyant , when she returned to the apartment that Sunday afternoon . The rally had been a great success . Thousands had marched , many thousands . She packed food and an old blanket into a shopping bag . Her mood continuedhigh all during our walk along Eastern Parkway . She talked on and on . You could sense the effect that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Union legislation , an awareness of horrorslike Georgia chain gangs , laws to protect the working man , the efforts of writers and artists for the people of Spain . The capitalistswho thought they could do whatever they wished with America should have come out to that rally . She was still in this exuberant mood when we turned into Prospect Park and walked along the curving path beneath spring trees past the lake , with its boats , and past playing children and adults on blankets under thep274trees , to the edge of a long stretch of young green grass where her friends waited for us . There were about a dozen of them , men and women her age and a little older , and four children , all younger than I. Most of the adults I knew from the meetings in our apartment , but I had not met the children before now . We sat on blankets and ate . It was a warm and brilliant day . The sun shone on the lake and the trees . I lay on the blanket and listened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police somewhere along their line of march and about the war in Spain and the Popular Front and the coming revolution and Comrade Stalin and someone called Robert Epstein who had enlisted in the loyalist air force and was leaving that Tuesday for Spain . I caught glimpses of the lake through the trees . They seemed an ardent and intense group ; the air vibrated with their talk . My mother was their center , their magnetic pole . She looked radiant with her long dark hair , white blouse , red beret , and brownish red skirt . I wondered idly what she and Mr. Dinn had talked about the night before . I had not even asked her what picture they had seen . How could someone as religious as Mr. Dinn go out with someone as irreligious as my mother ? I lay back on the blanket and put my hand over my eyes and listened to the happy noises in the park . Normal days of school followed , and dismal spring rain . That Saturday night my mother went out again to a neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came periodically to the meetings in our apartment . And a week later I lay again on the grass of Prospect Park and listened as my school happily celebratedLag Ba'omer , the holiday that commemorates that day , about two thousand years ago during the Jewish revolution against Rome , when a raging plague that had been killing the students of a great sage had begun to ease . The sage , Rabbi Akiva , ' had been a leader of that revolution : a scholar like my mother and a fighter like my father . I lay beneath a tree in a beam of sunlight and listened top275schoolmates playing on the grass . Some were off on the side with bows and arrows . Others were in running games and in a tug-ofwar . Their noises drifted over me , dreamlike , gossamer , an illusion . The air was soft and warm . Far above us in the blue sky , so small it seemed a dark stiff-winged bird , an airplane flew slowly by , its engines droning lazily . I could feel the vibrations on my skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join the game but I closed my eyes and lay very still in the beam of warm light . It seemed then that someone came and stood over me for a long moment , concealing the sun . Give us a hug , my love , I heard a voice say . A big hug . It has to last a long time . That 's right , my love . That 's a hug ! I opened my eyes and sat up on the grass . Schoolmates played at their games and teachers stood about , watching . The lake glistenedthrough the trees . A boy stood at the edge of the lake , tossingstones into the water . Someone called my name . I sat very still , watching the boy toss the stones at the lake . The stones struck the water with little splashes and disappeared into its depths . Again someone called my name . I rose and brushed grass from my skirt and joined my classmates in a game of tug-of-war . That summer we stayed in the city . My mother enrolled me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to take me back at first ; there was a fuss , and my mother prevailed . I played with others on the grass and went boating in the lake . In the early weeks of the summer a counselor sat next to me in the boat . Then they let me sit with a camper . I trailed my hands in the wake of the boat and looked down into the water . Warm and darkly golden on the surface and then dark and cold and darker still . I remembered the farmhouse and the beach and the horses of the previous summer and wondered if it might not somehow all have been a dream . Where was Aunt Sarah ? My mother was going out often with two or three of the men who came to the meetings in our apartment . Very early one Sun/day morning Mr. Dinn pulled up in his black sedan and we drove out to Sea Gate and spent the day with him and David in the house next to the cottage where we had once lived in the summers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt a little strange , peering over at that cottage from the screened-in porch of the house where David now lived . From the porch I looked out across the dunes and saw my mother and Mr. Dinn walking together in bathing suits on the crowded beach . Mr. Dinn 's tall frame was bony and pale ; my mother seemed so small beside him , her hair loose and long , her skin white . David asked me if I wanted to build a castle and I said , no , I was not in a mood for castles . Nor did I want to swim . I walked with him down the beach and watched him in the water , swimming skillfully , his long tanned body flashing in the sunlight , and wondered who had taught him . " My father , " he said , shaking the water from his dark hair and drying himself with a towel . " It 's in the Gemora . A fatheris supposed to make sure his child learns how to swim . " In the third week of July my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farmhouse . She had returned from Spain and was remaining in America . She would be at the farmhouseall summer and would love us to join her there . But I did n't want to go without my mother , and my mother could n't go because of her work . She wrote back , regretfully declining the invitation . In August , amidst the usual letters in our mailbox that were appeals for funds for labor defense committees , for refugees from Spain , for assistance to striking workers , was a letter from Jakob Daw . He was now in Marseilles . His health had improved somewhat in the warm air of the Mediterranean . He lived in a flat that looked out on the sea . He could dream of Dakar and Martinique as nearby places of refuge if Hitler ever came to France . Yes , he was still writing . A small collection of his stories would soon appear , translated into French . He was grateful to my mother for her work on the English edition of his stories . He had dreamed of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dream h*p277had neglected to specify that they not be separated by an ocean . Another of the many ironies of our century : it played with human dreams as a child played with sand . He lived now off the generosityof his publishers and friends . How much did one man need in order to live ? And a sick man at that . If Hitler came to France he would leave Marseilles . He would need an exit visa , a transit visa , a final visa . That would require a bit of money . Did it sound insane , Hitler coming to France ? As insane as had onCe been the possibility of Franco taking all of Spain . At any rate , he would be prepared . He would go to Martinique and Santo Domingo . That was the route . He had made the necessary inquiries . He would not be trapped again as he had once been trapped in Spain . How was Ilana Davita ? " Tell her our bird still nests peacefully in our harp and listens with pleasure as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the daughter of Michael and ChannahChandal would one day attend a yeshiva ? Nothing I write can be as astonishing as life , which is indeed the strangest story of all . Jakob Daw . " At the end of August , Ruthie returned from the mountains with her parents , and in the first week of September we were back in school . My mother had begun to go out regularly with one of the two men who used to come to the apartment on Sunday afternoons for the study sessions on Karl Marx . He was a short thin man with sparse blond hair , angular features , and gray , unsmiling eyes . He wore tweed jackets and chain-smoked . His name was Charles Carter and he was an assistant professor of modern history at Brooklyn College . He had an intense air and a high voice . He talked a great deal and used words I could not understand , and once when I asked him to explain some words he grew annoyed and impatient , and I did not ask him again . My mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " I said.  |p278She  looked hurt and upset . " Why ? " " I do n't know . " " He 's a brilliant person , Ilana , and a loyal member of the party . " I said nothing . She said , in a quiet voice , " Do you think you might like him as your father ? " I stared at her . A chill darkness moved through me . She said , after a long moment , " You have no idea what it 's like to be alone , Ilana . " Mr. Dinn came over one Saturday night that fall and took my mother to a theater in Manhattan . How dignified he looked in his dark coat and suit and hat . They returned home very late . The door harp woke me . I heard them go through the hallway to the kitchen . I fell back asleep and was awakened sometime later by their loud voices . They were in an argument and were making no effort to conceal their anger . " Think of what you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Is n't one mistake enough ? Think ! " " You have no right to meddle in my life , Ezra , " my mother said . " No right whatsoever . " " Then think of the child , Channah . What 's the matter with you ? You 're a brilliant woman . You solve the whole world 's problems , but you ca n't solve your own . You 're so filled with anger at your foolish father that you ca n't see how you 're hurting yourself and the child . " " I do n't want to hear you talking that way , Ezra . I 'm a grown woman . I 'm not your little cousin from Europe . Do n't preach at me ! " " You 'll take the child from here and move with her to Chicago ? Where is your head , Channah ? We do n't live forever . The mistakes we make now are harder and harder to clean up . Who will clean up this one in Chicago ? You have no one in Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I loved him . You know that . And Charles wo n't be a mistake . Do n't treat me like a child . He 's a brilliant man . And he writes and  --  "  | " And you 'll help him with his books and his monographs . You 'll raise Ilana as a nice midwestern girl . You 'll organize for the party in Chicago . You 'll bear his children . " " I do n't want any more children . " " My God , Channah . What are you doing to yourself ? " " I do n't want any more of this conversation . " " I will not stand by and let you  --  " " Ezra , stop . Please stop . " " Think of your mother . Think of your grandfather . " " Do n't do that to me , Ezra . You tried that once before . Do n't  --  do  --  that  --  to -- me ! " There was a long silence . " All right , " Mr. Dinn said in a drained voice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard a chair scrape against the kitchen floor and his footsteps in the hallway . The door opened and closed and the harp sang . My mother remained in the kitchen , sobbing . I got out of bed and went through the dim hallway in my bare feet . My mother sat at the table , her head in her hands . I squinted in the light . " Mama ? " She looked up , startled , and quickly wiped her eyes with the palms of her hands . Her face was puffy . Strands of wet hair lay upon her cheeks . Her lipstick was smeared . " Are we moving again , Mama ? " She stared at me through the sheen in her eyes . " I do n't want to move again . " " Ilana  --  " " Can I live with the Helfmans if you move with that man to Chicago ? " Her mouth fell open . I saw her face go white . " Go to sleep , Ilana . " " I do n't want to move to Chicago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago when I 'm finally happy ? " " Ilana , I have n't the strength to  --  " " Papa would n't want you to move . "  |p280Her  lips stiffened with sudden flashing anger . " I wo n't go to Chicago with you and that man . I do n't like that man . I think he 's  --  " " Young lady , do n't you dare ! Do n't you dare ! " She raised her hand to strike me . I drew back . She had never raised her hand to me before . Her eyes had a dark , wild look . She stopped and lowered her hand and sat at the table , breathing heavily , staring . I went back along the hallway to my room . My feet were cold . I lay in my bed in the darkness , frightened by the hate I felt for my mother . I wrote to Jakob Daw in Marseilles and to Aunt Sarah at the farmhouse . I attended school . At the end of October I was asked to see the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and moist lips . He informed me that I was being moved up one grade in Hebrew . I saw David in the yard during the morning recess and told him . He let out a whoop of joy and encircledme with a crushing hug  --  from which he immediately retreatedin red-faced embarrassment . Ruthie jumped up and down and squealed with delight . My mother nodded absently and said , " Very nice , Ilana . " She had other things on her mind . She was seeing Charles Carter very often now . He had accepted an associate professorship at the University of Chicago and would be leaving New York the following summer . He tried hard to becomemy friend by showing an interest in my Hebrew studies . He had no religion and was not Jewish . When he came into my room he smoked and often left ashes on my floor . As soon as he got to Chicago he would start his research for the new book he was planning on the rise of the labor movement in America . " Will you write about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at me . It seemed always to be difficult for him to reconcilemy questions to my age . " Certainly , " he said . " You bet . " " Do you know how many different meanings there are for the word strike ? "  |p281He  squinted at me through the smoke of his cigarette and appearednot to know what to say . " You 're showing off , Ilana , " my mother said . " My father used to write about strikes . When I was a little girl he used to go away to strikes and write about them for his newspaper . Did you ever write about strikes for a newspaper ? " " No , " he said , and exhaled a cloud of cigarette smoke that rose slowly to the ceiling of the kitchen . " Were you in the war in Spain ? " " No . " " Will you be going to Spain ? " " No . I teach , you see . " " What do you teach ? " " Modern history . " " About wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet . " " My mother was in the big war . She was in a pogrom . " " Ilana . " " Are you going to marry my mother ? " " Rana ! " " We 've talked about it . " " You can marry my mother if you want , but I wo n't go to Chicago ! " " Ilana ! " " I think I 'll go to bed now . I 'm very tired . Good night . I hope you write a good book about strikes . " I left them in the kitchen and went to my room . Some days later my mother received a letter from Jakob Daw . It was in German and she would not translate it for me . She read it at the kitchen table , her face slowly stiffening . She looked at me . " You had no right , " she said angrily . " I have my own life to live . " " Ca n't I write to Uncle Jakob ? " " Write to him about the weather . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't write to him asking him to change my mind . "  |p282A  letter arrived from Aunt Sarah addressed to me and my mother . She was working in a Boston hospital and living in Newton Centre . She wished my mother well . She planned to spend the last ten days of December at the farmhouse . If my mother and I could somehow manage to break away for a few days we would be welcome . The beach had a special loveliness to it in the winter . She understood that Chicago was a raw and bitterlycold city with little culture and a pervasive odor from the slaughterhouses . Still , she wished my mother all the luck . Was it at all possible that we could come up in December ? " Whom else have you written ? " my mother asked . " No one . " " You will not write anyone again about this . " I said nothing . " Do you hear me , young lady ? " " Yes . " A letter arrived for me from Jakob Daw . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your mother is young and beautiful and deserves her own life . You will be a good girl and not cause her sorrow . She has had at least two lifetimes of sorrow already . She is the kindest and gentlest of little birds , the sort whose suffering is almost never noticed . We must care for her and be gentle with her . Write to me again . Uncle Jakob . " I was at my desk one night that November doing my Hebrew homework when the apartment door opened . I heard the harp and waited for my mother 's greeting . Always she called out , " I 'm home ! " Now , instead , she went with urgent steps through the hallway . The door to her room opened and quickly closed . The apartment was silent . I went from my room into the kitchen . The newspapers which my mother always brought home with her lay on the table . I looked at the headlines and read a few paragraphs about a ven/geance shooting of a German embassy official in Paris by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nazis from Germany back to Poland with nothing more than a few articles of clothing . I read some of the paragraphs again . Then I looked up . How silent the air had suddenly become , how hushed  --  as if all the world were holding its breath . I went from the kitchen and stood for a moment outside the door to my mother 's room . I heard nothing . I returned to the kitchen and read some more . I was slowly reading the piece in The New York Times when my mother came into the kitchen . She put on her apron and stood at the sink . " Will it hurt Uncle Jakob ? " I asked . " I do n't know , " she said . Her back was to me . " I do n't think so . " " The Jewish man should n't have done that . " " He should n't have , Ilana . You 're right . But sometimes if youhurt a person badly enough , you cause him to do crazy things . Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table ? " Three days later , as I walked past the candy store on my way toschool , I saw on the front page of The New York Times , NAZISSMASH , LOOT AND BURN JEWISH SHOPS AND TEMPLES UNTIL GOEBBELSCALLS HALT . A second headline on that page announced , ALLVIENNA 'S SYNAGOGUES ATTACKED ; FIRES AND BOMBS WRECK 18 OUT OF 2I . My briefcase felt very heavy . I put it down and stood in the cold November air , reading . " BERLIN , Nov. lo .  --  A wave of destruction , looting and incendiarismunparalleled in Germany since the Thirty Years War and in Europe generally since the Bolshevist revolution , swept over Great Germany today as National Socialist cohorts took vengeanceon Jewish shops for the murder by a young Polish Jew of Ernst vom Rath , third secretary of the German Embassy in Paris . " I read it again . I picked up my briefcase and walked quickly to school.  |p284David  said to me during recess , " Did you see the papers ? We have relatives in Germany . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives in Germany ? " " No . Wo n't it happen in America ? " " What ? " " All the breaking and the burning and the hurting of Jews . " " The government wo n't let it happen here . " " But there are Fascists in America . They demonstrate in the streets of New York . I 'm really scared , David . " My mother said to me that evening during supper , " The Nazis are barbarians and must be stopped . Do you understand now why I let your father go to Spain ? " I did not respond . Faintly , through the walls , drifted the Shabbos songs of the Helfmans from the apartment below . Did n't they know what was happening ? Why were they singing ? I wondered if the Jews in Germany and Vienna were singing Shabbos songs . Broken windows , plundered synagogues , burned Torah scrolls . Later in my room I looked out my window and imagined broken glass everywhereon our street and when I lay in bed I imagined broken glass all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school smashed and the synagogue thick with smoke and flames . Everywherefire and glass ; tiny glistening slivers along the sidewalks and in the branches of the trees and on the winter grass in Prospect Park and in the lake . I remembered a story I had read in a magazineone summer in the cottage at Sea Gate . POGROM IN SEPTEMBER ! Someone had patented a special weapon called the Kike Killer . What had he said ? " We 're not going to drive the Jews from this country . We 're going to bury ' em right here ! " That was where I had first seen the word pogrom . But I had been too frightened then to ask my mother what it meant . Pogrom . I fell asleep and woke in the morning , tired and chilled with sweat . I pulled aside the curtains and raised the shade . Brilliant sunlight entered my room . I dressed quickly and walked along tranquil streets to the synagogue.  |p285The  room was unusually crowded by the time I arrived and my seat near the dividing curtain with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elderly woman . One of the few empty seats left was in the first row . I sat down and found myself facing the bare front wall of the room and with a hazy , distorted view of the other side . The service sounded subdued , the singing restrained . A boy read the Torah , hurriedly and with no errors . When the Torah was returned to the ark , all sat down . Silence filled the room . The synagogue did not have a rabbi . From time to time one of the men would deliver a brief talk before the Silent Devotion of the additional service . Now a man began to speak and I recognized immediately the deep , slightly nasal voice of Mr. Dinn . I saw him vaguely through the curtain . He stood at the lectern in his dark suit and long prayer shawl and dark felt hat . I looked through the curtain for David but he sat among tall adults and I could not see him . " We are confronted by a new Haman , " Mr. Dinn began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This new Haman does not requirethe approval of a higher authority for his acts of brutality . This Haman is himself the highest authority in his land . Germany has returned to the age of Teutonic barbarism . " Today 's Torah reading tells us about the destruction of Sedom and Amorrah . What terrible sins were committed by those cities ? Our sages gave us a long list of their sins . But one sin appears to stand out above the others . The people of Sedom and Amorrah hated strangers who entered their cities . These were wealthy cities that refused to share their good fortunes with anyone unknown to them . The stranger would be defiled , dishonored . He would be given no recourse to the law . He would be killed . How would all this be done ? Our sages tell us that when a stranger entered those cities he would be set upon and beaten . Bleeding , he would go to a court of law and ask for damages . Whereupon the judge would tell the poor victim to pay his attacker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story is told by the rabbis about Eliezer , the servant of Abraham , who one day visited Sedom and was in/jured , and sued for damages in the court and was told by the judge to pay his attacker a bloodletting fee . Whereupon Eliezer picked up a stone and struck the judge and said , The money you now owe me for this bloodletting you can pay to the one whom I owe . ' " Soft laughter rippled across the room . Mr. Dinn waited a moment , then continued . " Law that is used to victimize the stranger , the one who is helpless  --  that is the law of Sedom and Amorrah . Jews have lived in Germany for a thousand years . Still the Germans look upon us as strangers because we worship a different God , came to the land from the warm south rather than the frozen north , had our beginningsin a desert rather than on a tundra . We now know the true nature of Nazi Germany . It is Sedom and Amorrah . And it will be destroyed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The room was very still . He went on . " I 'm not a politician . I 'm a lawyer . But this much I do know . There are times when people must choose sides and tell themselves , That 's my enemy , and the enemy of my enemy is , at least for now , my ally and my friend . ' Let us now find who our true friends are and join ourselves to them . Together with them , and with the help of God , we will destroy this brutal twentiethcenturySedom and Amorrah . " A murmur of approval swept through the large room . Mr. Dinn sat down . I saw David lean forward out of the adults around him and hug his father . People were shaking Mr. Dinn 's hand . An elderly man rose and walked over toghe lectern and resumedthe service . Later I told my mother about Mr. Dinn 's talk , and she said soberly , " The Fascists wo n't destroy only Jews , Ilana . They will destroydecency everywhere . That 's why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why your father went to Spain . Who else is trying to stop the Nazis today ? England ? France ? America ? Who else ? " " I 'm very scared of the Nazis , Mama . " " Yes , " she said . " There 's good reason to be scared of the Nazis . "  |p287A  letter arrived from Jakob Daw . The recently published French edition of his stories had been well received by all who were not involved in politics . And since nearly all the French were involved in politics , the voices of approvalhad been few , indeed . The right had called him a Marxist obscurantist and his writings a threat to moral decency , and the left had labeled him a voice of the decadent bourgeois class . Still , there were some who read his stories and understood . Here and there small islands of sanity were still visible in the fog of madness descending upon Europe . " How is our Ilana ? Well , I hope . How old is she now ? Ten , I believe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it still your intention to move to Chicago ? If so , I wish you well . The cough is bad and seems not to be helped now by the Mediterranean air . What a strange darkness I feel about me everywhere in this sunlit city ! It is as if a curtain is being drawn across the entire vault of heaven while a drum beats a distant barbarous rhythm . I grow weary and must lie down now . Please remember me to Ezra Dinn . Jakob Daw . " The winter months wore on . At the social work agency , my mother had begun to work mostly with Jewish immigrant , recentarrivals who were trying to bring the rest of their families out of Germany . Her days were filled with the desperation of frightenedpeople . She came home , made supper , worked at her desk , went to bed . The party meetings continued . On weekends she 1 went out with G'arles Carter . Mr. Dinn no longer visited us . Ruthie told me " that he and David planned to move into ourapartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked by her agency not to leave until the end of the year . She had a special ability with refugees , and the agency sorely needed her . They were short of people with her talents . They asked her to use the additional months to train the woman who would replace her . My mother agreed . Charles Carter would be leaving for Chicago in August , and we would follow a few months later  --  not in August , as had originally beenp288planned . My mother explained it all to me again and again . I said yes , I understood , I understood . But I did not really understand . I did not want to leave for Chicago , especially in the middle of a school year . There were fights between us . Our kitchen became a battleground . The days were longer now and the winds warmer . I walked alone often in Prospect Park along the rim of the lake , gazing at my reflection in the water . Trees were returning to life , tiny shoots of grass were springing from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany too ? Somehow it seemed to me that Germany should be covered with darkness : black sky , black grass , black leaves , black trees , black sun . I did n't want to share the lovelinessof a green spring with Germany , my last spring in this neighborhood . Everything I saw now I was seeing for the final time . I thought of the Lag Ba'omer day of games that had taken place here last year . Had a year gone by already ? Was it two years since my father had died ? I had been told by the head of the HebrewDepartment of my school that if I continued my good work I would be moved into my regular Hebrew class in September . I did not want to go to Chicago and live in an apartment somewherewith my mother and Charles Carter . Would they sleep in the same bed ? Would I have to share a bathroom with him ? Papa , why did you have to try to save that nun ? For once , only once , could n't you not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I walked slowly back through the park to the botanical garden . I had gone with my class to the garden during the past week and a man had talked to us about the different kinds of flowers that grew there . It was lovely in that garden in the spring : beds of flowers , a banked hill glowing with yellow daffodils , winding paths , scented air  --  an enchanted magical kingdom . My mother had not come to the park or the garden in a long time . Too much work to do . Too much to think about . Too much . A haunted brooding had settled upon her like a garment of mourning . We rarely talked now . She was reading the galley proofs of the book of my father 's special writing and translating into Englishp289the stories Jakob Daw had written while he had lived with us . She worked at the desk in her bedroom , in a nightgown , and often her door was shut . Sometimes she would wander out of the room with papers in her hands and sit near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees , and I would be able to see the tips of her breasts through the thin cloth of the nightgownand the vague hint of the triangular darkness at the junctureof her legs . I wondered when I would begin to look like that , breasts and nipples and hair between my legs  --  and a faint stirring would begin somewhere deep within me . My mother seemed no longer to care how she looked as she walked about the apartment or that , in her nightgown , as she stood by the window or before the living-room floor lamp , she was almost naked to my eyes . She would sit looking out at the trees or reading and playing with her hair , twisting long strands of it in her fingers . She would turn on the radio to listen to the news or to music . She listened often to the news . And the news was always bad . Late that spring on a warm and sunny day I climbed into a bus along with my classmates and rode to an art gallery in Manhattan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not certain . We did that sort of thing from time to time : went on trips to museums , the theater , the ballet . But this was our first visit to an art gallery . We had been told by our English teacher that the gallery was showing a very special painting ; she knew someone who worked there and had obtained permission for this class visit . I remember the ride through the tunnel and along the river and up narrow streets thick with people and traffic . There were only about twenty of us on that trip and we walked in a huddled mass about half a block through the heart of Manhattan and into the entrance of a tall building . I think it was a tall building ; I am not certain . I remember my English teacher being greeted by a handsome , dapper-looking man in a dark suit , and how we all quietly tittered at that . I remember carpeted rooms with paintings on the walls . Then the man led us into a room that was dominated by a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember if there werep290other paintings in the room ; there may have been drawings and sketches on the other walls . Ruthie , standing next to me , eyed the painting and giggled . " Look at it , " she whispered . " Is n't it crazy ? " The teacher began to talk to us about the painting . I had to crane my neck in order to see it . We stood near the wall across the room from it and still it was enormous and I could not see all of it at one time . I had never seen such a painting anywhere . It seemed inhabited by monsters and was not even in color but in black and white and gray . Most of my classmates seemed bewildered and bored . The teacher kept on talking and I stood there trying to see all of the painting at the same time and could not . She had mentioned the name Pablo Picasso a number of times and I was trying to remember where I had heard that name before . And then she said something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the painting and took a step toward it and stood very still , staring at the painting . The teacher had said the painting was called Guernica . A slight shiver ran through me . I could not stop staring at the painting . It was odd how silent the room had become , the teacher 's voice slowly fading as if absorbed by the walls . Guernica . Black and white and gray . Grotesque bodies of women and a horse and a bull . A woman with a dead child , screaming . A woman with naked breasts , running . A woman with arms raised , burning . A black and white bull , staring . A lamp clutched in a disembodied hand . And a light overhead . And bits and pieces of a dead soldier . And what was that in the darkness between the screaming head of the horse and the staring head of the bull ? A bird ! A small gray bird , head upturned , beak wide open , crying . And all in black and white and gray . How easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before  --  a bending of the knees and an upwardthrust and lightly through the air and landing effortlessly beside the bird and gently scooping it up and running with it away from the bull and the horse and through the rubble of blasted streets and fallen houses and fires and pieces of bodies to the river and the bridge at the edge of the town where my fatherp291was and helping him carry the wounded nun so his hip would n't crumple beneath her weight . People were shouting at me and I responded but I did not know what I was saying . I ran back and forth through the town , holding the bird to me , and I could not find my father . Fires and bombs and airplanes and screams and a bridge somewhere and a river . He was here and I could not find him . I turned a corner  --  and there was the bull , staring , and the horse , screaming . I held the bird , felt its warm and terrified pulsing . Ruthie was talking to me . My teacher was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fine , I said . Sure . I was okay . My mother was talking to me . " What is the matter with you ? You have n't eaten a thing . How can you waste food this way ? " How did I get back to my house ? And my room ? It should have been easy to find him . Guernica was a small town . Only a few thousand people . Where was the river and the bridge ? I lay in my bed with the gray bird in my hand and when I woke in the early morning the bird had grown tiny during the night , tinier than a thumbnail ; but I could still feel its beating heart and its warmth . Outside it was raining . I saw the rain in the leaves of the trees and on the street , a gray rain that ran in rivulets along the gutters , and I wondered if all the rains in all the world could ever put out the fires of Guernica . I got out of bed and went silentlythrough the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I placed the bird in the circular hollow of the door harp next to the black bird nesting there . Then I dressed and ate breakfast and left early for school . We lived in the city that summer and Mr. Carter came often to the apartment . Sometimes he stayed very late . Once he and my mother were in her room together for a long time . I played in the park and sometimes I imagined myself in Guernica , saving my father . David and Ruthie were away and Mr. Dinn no longer visited us . I went to the synagogue on Shabbos mornings but no one Ip292knew well was there . My father 's book would be published in September . My mother was sad when Mr. Carter left in early August for Chicago . It was a sweltering summer . I slept naked and sweating in my bed . Often I dreamed of all the ways I would save my father and the nun . Sometimes I prayed that my mother and I would never go to Chicago . Let something happen , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us from going . I did not know whom I was praying to . But it was good to think and whisper the words in the darkness of my room . I did not pray on my knees . Letters arrived from Jakob Daw , all in German , and my mother would not read them to me . They were personal , she said . Yes , he sent me his good wishes . No , he was not well . Would I please stop pestering her ; she was definitely not going to read me Jakob Daw 's letters . And she would grow angry and sometimes shout at me . We had become strangers to one another . At times I thoughtI hated her , and that frightened me terribly . After each of our quarrels I would journey into the painting , searching for myfather . Always somewhere in our lives that summer there seemed to be a radio . On weekdays I played in the park with others in the daycampprogram and went rowing on the lake . There was a radio in the small house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it like some dark utterance from a region of fire and pain . It would move across the grassy meadows and through the trees and over the lake . And in the nights the news would enter my room from the radio in the kitchen and become caught in the corner shadows and I would hear it there , vibrating softly with words I was listening to for the first time : mobilization , war of nerves , brink , hostilities  --  words of impending war . It was over that radio that the news first came to us of the treaty between Hitler and Stalin . We heard it during supper one night in the last week of August , the announcer 's voice calm and smooth : Germany and Russiahad signed a nonaggression pact . He talked about it at somep293length , then went on to other news . My mother turned off the radio . " Capitalist lies , " she said . " What they go through to slander us ! " " What does it mean ? " I asked . " Never mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finish your supper , Ilana . Filthy lies . Even the radio news is corrupt . " The phone rang . She went out of the kitchen to the hallway . I heard her talking in a low , tight voice , but could not make out her words . Some minutes later she returned to the kitchen and poured herself another cup of coffee . She spilled coffee on the table as she set down the cup and washed it off with a towel . Her hands were trembling . " Mama ? " " Leave me alone , Ilana . " " Mama ? " ' " Rana ! " I went out of the kitchen . The phone rang again . From my room I heard my mother 's voice , low , urgent . Later that night I went back into the kitchen for a glass of water and saw the radio was gone . I stood at the closed door to my mother 's room and heard the voice of a news announcer softly through the darkness . In the morning the radio was back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news . My mother stared at the radio , her face a clear mirror of her emotions : anger , pain , disbelief , bewilderment . She would not respond to any of my questions and left quickly to go to work . On my way to the day camp I stopped at a subway newsstand and looked at the headlines . I read , GERMANY AND RUSSIA SIGN TEN-YEAR NONAGGRESSION PACT . I asked the news vendor what it meant.and he told me to get out of the way , I was keeping him from taking care of his customers . In the park I listened to the radio and , later , in the rowboat on the lake I asked the counselorp294at the oars what nonaggression pact meant , and he explained it to me . He was the same counselor from whose boat I had jumped two summers before . " I do n't understand , " I said . He explained it again . The others in the boat were giving me queer looks . " You mean the Communists have become friends with the Fascists ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he said , " Ilana , sit still and stop rocking the boat . " " I do n't believe that , " I said . " I do n't care whether you believe it or not . Sit still ! " I sat very quietly . I believed none of it . He was a liar and a capitalisttool . I hated him and wished he would hurry and bring us to shore so I could get out of his boat . I did not go rowing with him in the afternoon but sat beneath a tree and read a copy of the Times that I had found in a trash can . I read : " Moscow , Aug. 24. - With the meticulous punctuality of a perfectly staged arrival , two huge Focke-Wulf Condor planes conveyingJoachim von Ribbentrop , the German Foreign Minister , and his thirty-two assistants , landed at the Moscow airdrome on the stroke of r P.M. yesterday . " Adequate but not excessive police precautions were taken at the airdrome . For the first time the Soviet authorities displayed the swastika banner , five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but were placed so as not to be visible from the outside .... " I put the paper back into the trash can . There was a party meeting in our apartment that night . People arrived angry . I could hear the anger in their tread as they came up the stairs . The harp sang and sang . I sat at my desk and listened to the shouting in the living room . " With that murderer ? " someone was screaming . " That barbarian ? I shit on the whole thing ! You want to know what I think of it ? I 'll tell you what I think of it.  |p295You  can take this card and shove it up your ass ! " Angry footsteps sounded through the hallway and then the slamming of our front door . The harp sang . There was an explosion of voices in the living room . A woman was shouting . I did not hear my mother . Some more people left , slamming the front door . The harp sang and sang . Two nights later there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before came to the apartment that night , the baldheadedman who had spoken at the memorial meeting for my father . I heard his quiet , authoritative voice through the walls of my room . He talked about the need for discipline , for buying time , for secure frontiers . I heard a man 's voice suddenly shout , " Fuck you , comrade ! You think I 'm going to kill myself for the party when it  --  " " Sit down ! " a woman shouted . " Listen to what he has to say ! " " To hell with it ! " the man shouted back . " We 're being played for suckers . Ca n't you see it ? " " I see breach of discipline , " a second man shouted . " That 's what I see . " " To hell with all of it ! " the first man shouted . " I gave you years of my life to fight fascism and now you give me this shit ! To hell with all of it ! " Again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door harp sang . I said to my mother at breakfast the following morning , " Mama , what are you going to do ? " She gave me a look of pain , a look that implored me to ask no more questions of her  --  and I finished my breakfast in silence and went off to the day camp . She went to a meeting that night and to another meeting a few nights later . In the middle of September , about two weeks after I had returned to school , yet another meeting took place in our apartment . Again , I heard raised voices and angry imprecations . And again , others shouted their demands for total adherence to party discipline : there was a reason for the move ; it was a **29;13562;TOOLONG face softened suddenly . He could n't conceal his shock . " Les Innocents destroyed ! " he whispered . " You 're lying to me ... " " I never lie , " I said offhand . " At least not to those I do n't love . The people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them anymore . The emblems of the dead do n't matter to them as they matter to you . Within a few years , markets , streets , and houses will cover this spot . Commerce . Practicality . That is the eighteenth-century world . " " Stop ! " he whispered . " Les Innocents has existed as long as I have existed ! " His boyish face was strained . The old queen was undisturbed . " Do n't you see ? " I said softly . " It is a new age . It requires a new evil . And I am that new evil . " I paused , watching him . " I am the vampire for these times . " He had not foreseen my point . And I saw in him for the first time a glimmer of terrible understanding , the first glimmer of real fear . I made a small accepting gesture . " This incident in the village church tonight , " I said cautiously , " it was vulgar , I 'm inclined to agree . My actions on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blunders . And you know they are n't the source of your rancor . Forget them for the moment and try to envision my beauty and my power . Try to see the evil that I am . I stalk the world in mortal dress  --  the worst of fiends , the monster who looks exactly like everyone else . " The woman vampire made a low song of her laughter . I could feel only pain from him , and from her the warm emanation of her love . " Think of it , Armand , " I pressed carefully . " Why should Death lurk in the shadows ? Why should Death wait at the gate ? There is no bedchamber , no ballroom that I can not enter . Death in the glow of the hearth , Death on tiptoe in the corridor , that is what I am . Speak to me of the Dark Gifts  --  I use them . I 'm Gentleman Death in silk and lace , come to put out the candles . The canker in the heart of the rose . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard Armand sigh . " There is no place where they can hide from me , " I said , " these godless and powerful ones who would destroy les Innocents . There is no lock that can keep me out . " He stared back at me silently . He appeared sad and calm . His eyes were darkened slightly , but they were untroubled by malice or rage . He did n't speak for a long moment , and then : " A splendid mission , that , " he said , " to devil them mercilessly as you live among them . But it 's you still who do n't understand . " " How so ? " I asked . " You ca n't endure in the world , living among men , you can not survive.  | " But I do , " I said simply . " The old mysteries have given way to a new style . And who knows what will follow ? There 's no romance in what you are . There is great romance in what I am ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You do n't know what you 're saying , you have only just come into being , you are young . " " He is very strong , however , this child , " mused the queen , " and so is his beautiful newborn companion . They are fiends of high-blown ideas and great reason , these two . " " You ca n't live among men ! " Armand insisted again . His face colored for one second . But he was n't my enemy now ; rather he was some wondering elder struggling to tell me a critical truth . And at the same moment he seemed a child imploring me , and in that struggle lay his essence , parent and child , pleading with me to listen to what he had tosay . " And why not ? I tell you I belong among men . It is their blood that makes me immortal . " " Ah , yes , immortal , but you have not begun to understand it , " he said . " It 's no more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did Magnus go into the flames ? It 's an age-old truth among us , and you have n't even guessed it . Live among men , and the passing years will drive you to madness . To see others grow old and die , to see kingdoms rise and fall , to lose all you understand and cherish  --  who can endure it ? It will drive you to idiot raving and despair . Your own immortal kind is your protection , your salvation . The ancient ways , do n't you see , which never changed ! " He stopped , shocked that he had used this word , salvation , and it reverberated through the room , his lips shaping it again . " Armand , " the old queen sang softly . " Madness may come to the eldest we know , whether they keep to the old ways or abandon them . " She made a gesture as if to attack him with her white claws , screeching with laughter as he stared coldly back . " I have kept to the old ways as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ? Perhaps that is why I have kept them so well ! " He shook his head angrily in protest . Was he not the living proof it need not be so ? But she drew near to me and took hold of my arm , turning my face towards her . " Did Magnus tell you nothing , child ? " she asked . I felt an immense power flowing from her . " While others prowled this sacred place , " she said , " I went alone across the snow-covered fields to find Magnus . My strength is so great now it is as if I have wings . I climbed to his window to find him in his chamber ,  |p202and  together we walked the battlements unseen by all save the distant stars . " She drew even closer , her grip tightening . " Many things , Magnus knew , " she said . " And it is not madness which is your enemy , not if you are really strong . The vampire who leaves his coven to dwell among human beings faces a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to love mortals ! He comes to understandall things in love . " " Let me go , " I whispered softly . Her glance was holding me as surely as her hands . " With the passage of time he comes to know mortals as they may never know each other , " she continued , undaunted , her eyebrows rising , " and finally there comes the moment when he can not bear to take life , or bear to make suffering , and nothing but madness or his own death will ease his pain . That is the fate of the old ones which Magnus described to me , Magnus who suffered all afflictions in the end . " At last she released me . She receded from me as if she were an image in a sailor 's glass . " I do n't believe what you 're saying , " 1 whispered . But the whisper was like a hiss . " Magnus ? Love mortals ? " " Of course you do not , " she said with her graven jester 's smile . Armand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not understand . " My words have no meaning now , " she added . " But you have all thetime in the world to understand ! " Laughter , howling laughter , scraping the ceiling of the crypt . Cries again from within the walls . She threw back her head with her laughter . Armand was horror-stricken as he watched her . It was as if he saw the laughter emanating from her like so much glittering light . " No , but it 's a lie , a hideous simplification ! " I said . My head was throbbing suddenly . My eyes were throbbing . " I mean it 's a concept born out of moral idiocy , this idea of love ! " I put my hands to my temples . A deadly pain in me was growing . The pain was dimming my vision , sharpening my memory of Magnus 's dungeon , the mortal prisoners who had died among the rotted bodies of those condemned before them in the stinking crypt . Armand looked to me now as if I were torturing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And her laughter went right on , rising and falling away . Armand 's hands went out towards me as if he would touch me but did not dare . All the rapture and pain I 'd known in these past months came together inside me . I felt quite suddenly as if I would begin to roar as I had that night on Renaud 's stage . I was aghast at these sensations . I was murmuring nonsense syllables again aloud.  | " Lestat ! " Gabrielle whispered . " Love mortals ? " I said . I stared at the old queen 's inhuman face , horrified suddenly to see the black eyelashes like spikes about her glistening eyes , her flesh like animated marble . " Love mortals ? Does it take you three hundred years ! " I glared at Gabrielle . " From the first nights when I held them close to me , I loved them . Drinking up their life , their death , I love them . Dear God , is that not the very essence of the Dark Gift ? " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the theater . " Oh , what are you that you do not ? What vile things that this is the sum of your wisdom , the simple capacity to feel ! " I backed away from them , looking about me at this giant tomb , the damp earth arching over our heads . The place was passing out of the material into an hallucination . " God , do you lose your reason with the Dark Trick , " I asked , " with your rituals , your sealing up of the fledglings in the grave ? Or were you monsters when you were living ? How could we not all of us love mortals with every breath we take ! " No answer . Except the senseless cries of the starving ones . No answer . Just the dim beating of Nicki 's heart . " Well , hear me , whatever the case , " I said . I pointed my finger at Armand , at the old queen . " I never promised my soul to the devil for this ! And when I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that eat the corpses around here . If loving mortals is the hell you speak of , I am already in it . I have met my fate . Leave me to it and all scores are settled now . " My voice had broken . I was gasping . I ran my hands back through my hair . Armand seemed to shimmer as he came close to me . His face was a miracle of seeming purity and awe . " Dead things , dead things . . . " I said . " Come no closer . Talking of madness and love , in this reeking place ! And that old monster , Magnus , locking them up in his dungeon . How did he love them , his captives ? The way boys love butterflies when they rip off their wings ! " " No , child , you think you understand but you do not , " sang the woman vampire unperturbed . " You have only just begun your loving . " She gave a soft lilting laugh . " You feel sorry for them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be both human and inhuman . Is n't it so ? " " Lies ! " I said . I moved closer to Gabrielle . I put my arm around her . " You will come to understand all things in love , " the old queen went on , " when you are a vicious and hateful thing . This is your immortality , child . Ever deeper understanding of it . " And throwing up her arms , again she howled . " Damn you , " I said . I picked up Gabrielle and Nicki and carried themp204backwards towards the door . " You 're in hell already , " I said , " and I intend to leave you in hell now . " I took Nicolas out of Gabrielle 's arms and we ran through the catacombtowards the stairs . The old queen was in a frenzy of keening laughter behind us . And human as Orpheus perhaps , I stopped and glanced back . " Lestat , hurry ! " Nicolas whispered in my ear . And Gabrielle gave adesperate gesture for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman stood beside him laughing still . " Good-bye , brave children , " she cried . " Ride the Devil 's Road bravely . Ride the Devil 's Road as long as you can . " THE coven scattered like frightened ghosts in the cold rain as we burst out of the sepulcher . And baffled , they watched as we sped out of les Innocents into the crowded Paris streets . Within moments we had stolen a carriage and were on our way out of the city into the countryside . I DROVE the team on relentlessly . Yet I was so mortally tired that preternaturalstrength seemed purely an idea . At every thicket and turn of the road I expected to see the filthy demons surrounding us again . But somehow I managed to get from a country inn the food and drink Nicolas would need , and the blankets to keep him warm . He was unconscious long before we reached the tower , and I carried him up the stairs to that high cell where Magnus had first kept me . His throat was still swollen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he slept deeply as I laid him on the straw bed , I could feel the thirst in him , the awful craving that I 'd felt after Magnus had drunk from me . Well , there was plenty of wine for him when he awakened , and plenty of food . And I knew  --  though how I could n't tell  --  that he would n't die . What his daylight hours would be like , I could hardly imagine . But he would be safe once I turned the key in the lock . And no matter what he had been to me , or what he stood to be in the future , no mortal could wander free in my lair while I slept . Beyond that I could n't reason . I felt like a mortal walking in his sleep . I was still staring down at him , hearing his vague jumbled dreams  --  dreams of the horrors of les Innocents  --  when Gabrielle came in . She hadfinished burying the poor unfortunate stable boy , and she looked like ap205dusty angel again , her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She looked down at Nicki for a long moment and then she drew me out of the room . After I had locked the door , she led me down to the lower crypt . There she put her arms tightly around me and held me , as if she too were worn almost to collapse . " Listen to me , " she said finally , drawing back and putting her hands up to hold my face . " We 'll get him out of France as soon as we rise . No one will ever believe his mad tales . " I did n't answer . I could scarce understand her , her reasoning or her intentions . My head swam . " You can play the puppeteer with him , " she said , " as you did with Renaud 's actors . You can send him off to the New World . " " Sleep , " I whispered . I kissed her open mouth . I held her with my eyes closed . I saw the crypt again , heard their strange , inhuman voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gone , then we can talk about these others , " she said calmly . " Whether to leave Paris altogether for a while ... I let her go , and I turned away from her and I went to the sarcophagus and rested for a moment against the stone lid . For the first time in my immortal life I wanted the silence of the tomb , the feeling that all things were out of my hands . It seemed she said something else then . Do not do this thing ! WHEN I awoke I heard his cries . He was beating on the oaken door , cursing me for keeping him prisoner . The sound filled the tower , and the scent of him came through the stone walls : succulent , oh so succulent , smell of living flesh and blood , his flesh and blood . She slept still . Do not do this thing . Symphony of malice , symphony of madness coming through the walls , philosophy straining to contain the ghastly images , the torture , to surround it with language . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like being caught in a whirlwindof his cries , his human smell . And all the remembered scents mingled with it  --  the afternoon sunshineon a wooden table , the red wine , the smoke of the little fire.  | " Lestat ! Do you hear me ! Lestat ! " Thunder of fists against the door . Memory of childhood fairy tale : the giant says he smells the blood ofa human in his lair . Horror . I knew the giant was going to find the human . I could hear him coming after the human , step by step . I was the human . Only no more . Smoke and salt of flesh and pumping blood . " This is the witches ' place ! Lestat , do you hear me ! This is the witches ' place ! " Dull tremor of the old secrets between us , the love , the things that only we had known , felt . Dancing in the witches ' place . Can you deny it ? Can you deny everything that passed between us ? Get him out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then what ? All his life he is one of those slightly interesting but generally tiresome mortals who have seen spirits , talk of them incessantly , and no one believes him . Deepening madness . Will he be a comical lunatic finally , the kind that even the ruffians and bullies look after , playing his fiddle in a dirty coat for the crowds on the streets of Port-au-Prince ? " Be the puppeteer again , " she had said . Is that what I was ? No one will ever believe his mad tales . But he knows the place where we lie , Mother . He knows our names , the name of our kin  --  too many things about us . And he will never go quietly to another country . And they may go after him ; they will never let him live now . Where are they ? I went up the stairs in the whirlwind of his echoing cries , looked out the little barred window at the open land . They 'll be coming again . They have to come . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now I have them ! But what was the crux ? That he wanted it ? That he had screamed over and over that I had denied him the power ? Or was it that I now had the excuses I needed to bring him to me as I had wanted to do from the first moment ? My Nicolas , my love . Eternity waits . All the great and splendid pleasures of being dead . I went further up the stairs towards him and the thirst sang in me . To hell with his cries . The thirst sang and I was an instrument of its singing . And his cries had become inarticulate  --  the pure essence of his curses , a dull punctuation to the misery that I could hear without need of any sound . Something divinely carnal in the broken syllables coming from his lips , like the low gush of the blood through his heart . I lifted the key and put it in the lock and he went silent , his thoughts washing backwards and into him as if the ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single shell.  |p207I  tried to see him in the shadows of the room , and not it  --  the love for him , the aching , wrenching months of longing for him , the hideous and unshakable human need for him , the lust . I tried to see the mortal who did n't know what he was saying as he glared at me : " You , and your talk of goodness "  --  low seething voice , eyes glittering  --  " your talk of good and evil , your talk of what was right and what was wrong and death , oh yes , death , the horror , the tragedy ... " Words . Borne on the ever swelling current of hatred , like flowers opening in the current , petals peeling back , then falling apart : " ... and you shared it with her , the lord 's son giveth to the lord 's wife his great gift , the Dark Gift . Those who live in the castle share the Dark Gift  --  never were they dragged to the witches ' place where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the burnt stake , no , kill the old crone who can no longer see to sew , and the idiot boy who can not till the field . And what does he give us , the lord 's son , the wolf killer , the one who screamed in the witches ' place ? Coin of the realm ! That 's good enough for us ! " Shuddering . Shirt soaked with sweat . Gleam of taut flesh through the torn lace . Tantalizing , the mere sight of it , the narrow tightly muscled torso that sculptors so love to represent , nipples pink against the dark skin . " This power "  --  sputtering as if all day long he had been saying the words over with the same intensity , and it does not really matter that now I am present  --  " this power that made all the lies meaningless , this dark power that soared over everything , this truth that obliterated ... " No . Language . Not truth . The wine bottles were empty , the food devoured . His lean arms were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  --  his brown hair fallen out of its ribbon , his eyes enormous and glazed . But suddenly he pushed against the wall as if he 'd go through it to get away from me  --  dim remembrance of their drinking from him , the paralysis , the ecstasy  --  yet he was drawn immediately forward again , staggering , putting his hands out to steady himself by taking hold of things that were not there . But his voice had stopped . Something breaking in his face . " How could you keep it from me ! " he whispered . Thoughts of old magic , luminous legend , some great eerie strata in which all the shadowy things thrived , an intoxication with forbidden knowledge in which the natural things become unimportant . No miracle anymore to the leaves falling from the autumn trees , the sun in the orchard . No . The scent was rising from him like incense , like the heat and the smokep208of church candles rising . Heart thumping under the skin of his naked chest . Tight little belly glistening with sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of salt . I could scarce breathe . And we do breathe . We breathe and we taste and we smell and we feel and we thirst . " You have misunderstood everything . " Is this Lestat speaking ? It sounded like some other demon , some loathsome thing for whom the voice was the imitation of a human voice . " You have misunderstood everything that you have seen and heard . " " I would have shared anything I possessed with you ! " Rage building again . He reached out . " It was you who never understood , " he whispered . " Take your life and leave with it . Run . " " Do n't you see it 's the confirmation of everything ? That it exists is the confirmation  --  pure evil , sublime evil ! " Triumph in his eyes . He reached out suddenly and closed his hand on my face . " Do n't taunt me ! " I said . I struck him so hard he fell backwards , chastened , silent . " When it was offered me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With my last breath , I said no . " " You were always the fool , " he said . " I told you that . " But he was breaking down . He was shuddering and the rage was alchemizing into desperation . He lifted his arms again and then stopped . " You believed things that did n't matter , " he said almost gently . " There was something you failed to see . Is it possible you do n't know yourself what you possess now ? " The glaze over his eyes broke instantly into tears . His face knotted . Unspoken words coming from him of love . And an awful self-consciousness came over me . Silent and lethal , I felt myself flooded with the power I had over him and his knowledge of it , and my love for him heated the sense of power , driving it towards a scorching embarrassment which suddenly changed into something else . We were in the wings of the theater again ; we were in the village in Auvergne in that little inn . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden terror . He had taken a step back . And the very movement stoked the blaze in me , as much as the vision of his stricken face . He grew smaller , more fragile . Yet he 'd never seemed stronger , more alluring than he was now . All the expression drained from his face as I drew nearer . His eyes were wondrously clear . And his mind was opening as Gabrielle 's mind had opened , and for one tiny second there flared a moment of us together in the garret , talking and talking as the moon glared on the snow-covered roofs , or walking through the Paris streets , passing the wine back and forth , heads bowed against the first gust of winter rain , and there had been the eternity of growing up and growing old before us , and so much joy evenp209in misery , even in the misery  --  the real eternity , the real forever  --  the mortal mystery of that . But the moment faded in the shimmering expression of his face . " Come to me , Nicki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beckon . " If you want it , you must come . . . " I SAW a bird soaring out of a cave above the open sea . And there was something terrifying about the bird and the endless waves over which it flew . Higher and higher it went and the sky turned to silver and then gradually the silver faded and the sky went dark . The darkness of evening , nothing to fear , really , nothing . Blessed darkness . But it was falling graduallyand inexorably over nothing save this one tiny creature cawing in the wind above a great wasteland that was the world . Empty caves , empty sands , empty sea . All I had ever loved to look upon , or listen to , or felt with my hands was gone , or never existed , and the bird , circling and gliding , flew on and on , upwards past me , or more truly past no one , holding the entire landscape , without history or meaning , in the flat blackness of one tiny eye . I screamed but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood and each swallow passing down my throat and into fathomless thirst . And I wanted to say , yes , I understand now , I understand how terrible , how unbearable , this darkness . I did n't know . Could n't know . The bird sailing on through the darkness over the barren shore , the seamless sea . Dear God , stop it . Worse than the horror in the inn . Worse than the helpless trumpeting of the fallen horse in the snow . But the blood was the blood after all , and the heart  --  the luscious heart that was all hearts  --  was right there , on tiptoe against my lips . Now , my love , now 's the moment . I can swallow the life that beats from your heart and send you into the oblivion in which nothing may ever be understood or forgiven , or I can bring you to me . I pushed him backwards . I held him to me like a crushed thing . But the vision would n't stop . His arms slipped around my neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Then his tongue shot out . It licked hard at the gash I had made for him in my own throat . Yes , eager . But please stop this vision . Stop the upward flight and the great slant of the colorless landscape , the cawing that meant nothing over the howl of the wind . The pain is nothing compared to this darkness . I do n't want to . . I do n't want to . . . But it was dissolving . Slowly dissolving . And finally it was finished . The veil of silence had come down , as itp210had with her . Silence . He was separate . And I was holding him away from me , and he was almost falling , his hands to his mouth , the blood running down his chin in rivulets . His mouth was open and a dry sound came out of it , in spite of the blood , a dry scream . And beyond him , and beyond the remembered vision of the metallic sea and the lone bird who was its only witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Virgin Mary veil of gold around her shoulders , and she said with the saddest expression on her face : " Disaster , my son . " BY MIDNIGHT it was clear that he would not speak or answer to any voice , or move of his own volition . I lc remained still and expressionless in the places to which he was taken . I f the death pained him he gave no sign . If the new vision delighted him , he kept it to himself . Not even the thirst moved him . And it was Gabrielle who , after studying him quietly for hours , took him in hand , cleaning him and putting new clothes on him . Black wool she chose , one of the few somber coats I owned . And modest linen that made him look oddly like a young cleric , a little too serious , a little naive . And in the silence of the crypt as I watched them , I knew without doubt that they could hear each other 's thoughts . Without a word she guided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him back to the bench by the fire . Finally , she said , " He should hunt now , " and when she glanced at him , he rose without looking at her as if pulled by a string . Numbly I watched them going . Heard their feet on the stairs . And then I crept up after them , stealthily , and holding to the bars of the gate I watched them move , two feline spirits , across the field . The emptiness of the night was an indissoluble cold settling over me , closing me in . Not even the fire on the hearth warmed me when I returned to it . Emptiness here . And the quiet I had told myself that I wanted  --  just to be alone after the grisly struggle in Paris . Quiet , and the realization , which I could not bring myself to confess to her , the realization gnawing at my insides like a starved animal  --  that I couldn ' t stand the sight of him now.  |p211WHEN  I opened my eyes the next night , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could stand to look at him was n't important . I had made him this , and I had to rouse him from his stupor somehow . The hunt had n't changed him , though apparently he 'd drunk and killed well enough . And now it was up to me to protect him from the revulsion I felt , and to go into Paris and get the one thing that might bring him around . The violin was all he 'd ever loved when he was alive . Maybe now it would awaken him . I 'd put it in his hands , and he 'd want to play it again , he 'd want to play it with his new skill , and everything would change and the chill in my heart would somehow melt . As soon as Gabrielle rose I told her what I meant to do . " But what about the others ? " she said . " You ca n't go riding into Paris alone . " " Yes , I can , " I said . " You 're needed here with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could lure him into the open , the way he is now . And besides , I want to know what 's happening under les Innocents . If we have a real truce , I want to know . " " I do n't like your going , " she said , shaking her head . " I tell you , if I did n't believe we should speak to the leader again , that we had things to learn from him and the old woman , I 'd be for leaving Paris tonight . " " And what could they possibly teach us ? " I said coldly . " That the sun really revolves around the earth ? That the earth is flat ? " But the bitterness of my words made me feel ashamed . One thing they could tell me was why the vampires I 'd made could hear each other 's thoughts when I could not . But I was too crestfallen over my loathing of Nicki to think of all these things . I only looked at her and thought how glorious it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to see it restore her youthful beauty , render her again the goddess she 'd been to me when I was a little child . To see Nicki change had been to see him die . Maybe without reading the words in my soul she understood it only too well . We embraced slowly . " Be careful , " she said.  |p212I  SHOULD have gone to the flat right away to look for his violin . And there was still my poor Roget to deal with . Lies to tell . And this matter of getting out of Paris  --  it seemed more and more the thing for us to do . But for hours I did just what I wanted . I hunted the Tuileries and the boulevards , pretending there was no coven under les Innocents , that Nicki was alive still and safe somewhere , that Paris was all mine again . But I was listening for them every moment . I was thinking about the old queen . And I heard them when I least expected it , on the boulevard du Temple , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be in the places of light , as they called them . But within seconds , I knew that several of them were hiding behind the theater . And there was no malice this time , only a desperate excitement when they sensed that I was near . Then 1 saw the white face of the woman vampire , the dark-eyed pretty one with the witch 's hair . She was in the alleyway beside the stage door , and she darted forward to beckon to me . I rode back and forth for a few moments . The boulevard was the usual spring evening panorama : hundreds of strollers amid the stream of carriage traffic , lots of street musicians , jugglers and tumblers , the lighted theaters with their doors open to invite the crowd . Why should I leave it to talk to these creatures ? I listened . There were four of them actually , and they were desperately waiting for me to come . They were in terrible fear . All right . I turned the horse and rode into the alley and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone wall . The gray-eyed boy was there , which surprised me , and he had a dazed expression on his face . A tall blond male vampire stood behind him with a handsome woman , both of them swathed in rags like lepers . It was the pretty one , the dark-eyed one who had laughed at my little jest on the stairs under les Innocents , who spoke : " You have to help us ! " she whispered . " I do ? " I tried to steady the mare . She did n't like their company . " Why do I have to help you ? " I demanded . " He 's destroying the coven , " she said . " Destroying us . . . " the boy said . But he did n't look at me . He was staring at the stones in front of him , and from his mind I caught flashes of what was happening , of the pyre lighted , of Armand forcing his followers into the fire . I tried to get this out of my head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dark-eyed pretty one looked directly into my eyes as she strove to sharpen the pictures  --  Armand swinging a great charredp213beam of wood as he drove the others into the blaze , then stabbing them down into the flames with the beam as they struggled to escape . " Good Lord , there were twelve of you ! " I said . " Could n't you fight ? " " We did and we are here , " said the woman . " He burned six together , and the rest of us fled . In terror , we sought strange resting places for the day . We had never done this before , slept away from our sacred graves . We did n't know what would happen to us . And when we rose he was there . Another two he managed to destroy . So we are all that is left . He has even broken open the deep chambers and burned the starved ones . He has broken loose the earth to block the tunnels to our meeting place . " The boy looked up slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered . " You have brought us all down . " The woman stepped in front of him . " You must help us , " she said . " Make a new coven with us . Help us to exist as you exist . " She glanced impatiently at the boy . " But the old woman , the great one ? " I asked . " It was she who commenced it , " said the boy bitterly . " She threw herself into the fire . She said she would go to join Magnus . She was laughing . It was then that he drove the others into the flames as we fled . " I bowed my head . So she was gone . And all she had known and witnessed had gone with her , and what had she left behind but the simple one , the vengeful one , the wicked child who believed what she had known to be false . " You must help us , " said the dark-eyed woman . " You see , it 's his right as coven master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't survive . " " He could n't let the coven fall into chaos , " said the other woman vampire who stood behind the boy . " Without the faith in the Dark Ways , the others might have blundered , alarmed the mortal populace . But if you help us to form a new coven , to perfect ourselves in new ways ... " " We are the strongest of the coven , " said the man . " And if we can fend him off long enough , and manage to continue without him , then in time he may leave us alone . " " He will destroy us , " the boy muttered . " He will never leave us alone . He will lie in wait for the moment when we separate ... " " He is n't invincible , " said the tall male . " And he 's lost all conviction . Remember that . " " And you have Magnus 's tower , a safe place . . . " said the boy despairinglyas he looked up at me . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " You have to win this battle on your own . " " But surely you can guide us . . . " said the man.  | " You do n't need me , " I said . " What have you already learned from my example ? What did you learn from the things I said last night ? " " We learned more from what you said to him afterwards , " said the dark-eyed woman . " We heard you speak to him of a new evil , an evil for these times destined to move through the world in handsome human guise . " " So take on the guise , " I said . ' Fake the garments of your victims , and take the money from their pockets . And you can then move among mortals as I do . In time you can gain enough wealth to acquire your own little fortress , your secret sanctuary . " Then you will no longer be beggars or ghosts . " I could see the desperation in their faces . Yet they listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our voices . . . " said the dark-eyed woman . " You can fool mortals . It 's very easy . It just takes a little skill . " " But how do we start ? " said the boy dully , as if he were only reluctantlybeing brought into it . " What sort of mortals do we pretend to be ? " " Choose for yourself ! " I said . " Look around you . Masquerade as gypsiesif you will  --  that ought n't to be too difficult  --  or better yet mummers , " I glanced towards the lights of the boulevard . " Mummers ! " said the dark-eyed woman with a little spark of excitement . " Yes , actors . Street performers . Acrobats . Make yourselves acrobats . Surely you 've seen them out there . You can cover your white faces with greasepaint , and your extravagant gestures and facial expressions wo n't even be noticed . You could n't choose a more nearly perfect disguise than that . On the boulevard you 'll see every manner of mortal that dwells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know . " She laughed and glanced at the others . The man was deep in thought , the other woman musing , the boy unsure . " With your powers , you can become jugglers and tumblers easily , " I said . " It would be nothing for you . You could be seen by thousands who 'd never guess what you are . " " That is n't what happened with you on the stage of this little theater , " said the boy coldly . " You put terror into their hearts . " " Because I chose to do it , " I said . Tremor of pain . " That 's my tragedy . But I can fool anyone when I want to and so can you . " I reached into my pockets and drew out a handful of gold crowns . I gave them to the dark-eyed woman . She took them in both hands and stared at them as if they were burning her . She looked up and in her eyes I saw the image of myself on Renaud 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the streets . But she had another thought in her mind . She knew the theater was abandoned , that I 'd sent the troupe off.  |p215And  for one second , I considered it , letting the pain double itself and pass through me , wondering if the others could feel it . What did it really matter , after all ? " Yes , please , " said the pretty one . She reached up and touched my hand with her cool white fingers . " Let us inside the theater ! Please . " She turned and looked at the back doors of Renaud 's . Let them inside . Let them dance on my grave . But there might be old costumes there still , the discarded trappings of a troupe that had had all the money in the world to buy itself new finery . Old pots of white paint . Water still in the barrels . A thousand treasures left behind in the haste of departure . I was numb , unable to consider all of it , unwilling to reach back to embrace all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , looking away as if some little thing had distracted me . " You can go into the theater if you wish . You can use whatever is there . " She drew closer and pressed her lips suddenly to the back of my hand . " We wo n't forget this , " she said . " My name is Eleni , this boy is Laurent , the man here is Felix , and the woman with him , Eugenie . If Armand moves against you , he moves against us . " " I hope you prosper , " I said , and strangely enough , I meant it . I wondered if any of them , with all their Dark Ways and Dark Rituals , had ever really wanted this nightmare that we all shared . They 'd been drawn into it as I had , really . And we were all Children of Darkness now , for better or worse . " But be wise in what you do here , " I warned . " Never bring victims here or kill near here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IT WAS three o'clock before I rode over the bridge on to the Ile St.-Louis . I had wasted enough time . And now I had to find the violin . But as soon as I approached Nicki 's house on the quai I saw that something was wrong . The windows were empty . All the drapery had been pulled down , and yet the place was full of light , as if candles were burning inside by the hundreds . Most strange . Roget could n't have taken possession of the flat yet . Not enough time had passed to assume that Nicki had met with foul play . Quickly , I went up over the roof and down the wall to the courtyard window , and saw that the drapery had been stripped away there too . And candles were burning in all the candelabra and in the wall sconces . And some were even stuck in their own wax on the pianoforte and the desk . The room was in total disarray.  |p216Every  book had been pulled off the shelf . And some of the books were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been emptied sheet by sheet onto the carpet , and all the pictures were lying about on the tables with other small possessions  --  coins , money , keys . Perhaps the demons had wrecked the place when they took Nicki . But who had lighted all these candles ? It did n't make sense . I listened . No one in the flat . Or so it seemed . But then I heard not thoughts , but tiny sounds . I narrowed my eyes for a moment , just concentrating , and it came to me that I was hearing pages turn , and then something being dropped . More pages turning , stiff , old parchment pages . Then again the book dropped . I raised the window as quietly as I could . The little sounds continued , but no scent of human , no pulse of thought . Yet there was a smell here . Something stronger than the stale tobacco and the candle wax . The smell the vampires carried with them from the cemetery soil . More candles in the hallway . Candles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they lay in careless piles , the bedclothes snarled , the pictures in a heap . Cabinets emptied , drawers pulled out . And no violin anywhere , I managed to note that . And those little sounds coming from another room , pages being turned very fast . Whoever he was  --  and of course I knew who he had to be  --  he did not give a damn that I was there ! He had not even stopped to take a breath . I went farther down the hall and stood in the door of the library and found myself staring right at him as he continued with his task . It was Armand , of course . Yet I was hardly prepared for the sight he presented here . Candle wax dripped down the marble bust of Caesar , flowed over the brightly painted countries of the world globe . And the books , they lay in mountains on the carpet , save for those of the very last shelf in the corner where he stood , in his old rags still , hair full of dust , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page , his eyes intent on the words before him , his lips half open , his expression like that of an insect in its concentration as it chews through a leaf . Perfectly horrible he looked , actually . He was sucking everything out of the books ! Finally he let this one drop and took down another , and opened it and started devouring it in the same manner , fingers moving down the sentenceswith preternatural speed . And I realized that he had been examining everything in the flat in this fashion , even the bed sheets and curtains , the pictures that had been takenp217off their hooks , the contents of cupboards and drawers . But from the books , he was taking concentrated knowledge . Everything from Caesar 's Gallic If i , rs to modern English novels lay on the floor . But his manner was n't the entire horror . It was the havoc he was Ic:iving behind him , the utter disregard of everything he used . And his utter disregard of me . He finished his latest book , or broke off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a lower shelf . I found myself backing out of the room and away from him , staring numbly at his small dirty figure . His auburn hair shimmered despite the dirt in it ; his eyes burned like two lights . Grotesque he seemed , among all the candles and the swimming colors of the flat , this filthy waif of the netherworld , and yet his beauty held sway . I le had n't needed the shadows of Notre Dame or the torchlight of the crypt to flatter him . And there was a fierceness in him in this bright light that I had n't seen before . I felt an overwhelming confusion . He was both dangerous and compelling . I could have looked on him forever , but an overpowering instinct said : Get away . Leave the place to him if he wants it . What does it matter now ? The violin . I tried desperately to think about the violin . To stop watching the movement of his hands over the words in front of him , the relentless focus of his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I turned my back on him and went into the parlor . My hands were trembling . I could hardly endure knowing he was there . I searched everywhereand did n't find the damned violin . What could Nicki have done with it ? I could n't think . Pages turning , paper crinkling . Soft sound of the newspaper dropping to the floor . Go back to the tower at once . I went to pass the library quickly , when without warning his soundless voice shot out and stopped me . It was like a hand touching my throat . I turned and saw him staring at me . Do you love them , your silent children ? Do they love you ? That was what he asked , the sense disentangling itself from an endless echo . I felt the blood rise to my face . The heat spread out over me like a mask as I looked at him . All the books in the room were now on the floor . He was a haunt standing in the ruins , a visitant from the devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so young . The Dark Trick never brings love , you see , it brings only the silence . Hisp218voice seemed softer in its soundlessness , clearer , the echo dissipated . We used to say it was Satan 's will , that the master and the fledgling not seek comfort in each other . It was Satan who had to be served , after all . Every word penetrated me . Every word was received by a secret , humiliating curiosity and vulnerability . But I refused to let him see this . Angrily I said : " What do you want of me ? " It was shattering something to speak . I was feeling more fear of him at this moment than ever during the earlier battles and arguments , and I hate those who make me feel fear , those who know things that I need to know , who have that power over me . " It is like not knowing how to read , is n't it ? " he said aloud . " And your maker , the outcast Magnus , what did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the simplest things , did he ? " Nothing in his expression moved as he spoke . " Has n't it always been this way ? I las anyone ever cared to teach you anything ? " " You 're taking these things from my mind . . . " I said . I was appalled . I saw the monastery where I 'd been as a boy , the rows and rows of books that I could not read , Gabrielle bent over her books , her back to all of us . " Stop this ! " I whispered . It seemed the longest time had passed . I was becoming disoriented . He was speaking again , but in silence . They never satisfy you , the ones you make . In silence the estrangement and the resentment only grow . I willed myself to move but I was n't moving . I was merely looking at him as he went on . You long for me and I for you , and we alone in all this realm are worthy of each other . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched , amplified , like a note on the violin drawn out forever and ever . " This is madness , " I whispered . I thought of all the things he had said to me , what he had blamed me for , the horrors the others had described  --  that he had thrown his followers into the fire . " Is it madness ? " he asked . " Go then to your silent ones . Even now they say to each other what they can not say to you . " " You 're lying . . . " I said . " And time will only strengthen their independence . But learn for yourself . You will find me easily enough when you want to come to me . After all , where can I go ? What can I do ? You have made me an orphan again . " " I did n't  --  " I said.  | " Yes , you did , " he said . " You did it . You brought it down . " Still there was no anger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for you to ask the questions that only I can answer . " I stared at him for a long moment . I do n't know how long . It was as if I could n't move , and I could n't see anything else but him , and the great sense of peace I 'd known in Notre Dame , the spell he cast , was again working . The lights of the room were too bright . There was nothing else but light surrounding him , and it was as if he were coming closer to me and I to him , yet neither of us was moving . He was drawing me , drawing m towards him . I turned away , stumbling , losing my balance . But I was out of the room . I was running down the hallway , and then I was climbing out of the hack window and up to the roof . I rode into the Ile de la Cite as if he were chasing me . And my heart did n't stop its frantic pace until I had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tower was in darkness against the first glimmer of the morning light . My little coven had already gone to rest in their dungeon crypt . I did n't open the tombs to look at them , though I wanted desperately to do it , just to see Gabrielle and touch her hand . I climbed alone towards the battlements to look out at the burning miracle of the approaching morning , the thing I should never see to its finish again . Hell 's Bells ringing , my secret music .. . But another sound was coming to me . I knew it as I went up the stairs . And I marveled at its power to reach me . It was like a song arching over an immense distance , low and sweet . Once years ago , I had heard a young farm boy singing as he walked along the high road out of the village to the north . He had n't known anyone was listening . He had thought himself alone in the open country , and his voice had a private power and purity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his old song . This was the voice that was calling to me now . The lone voice , rising over the miles that separated us to gather all sounds into itself . I was frightened again . Yet I opened the door at the top of the staircase and went out onto the stone roof . Silken the morning breeze , dreamlike the twinkling of the last stars . The sky was not so much a canopy as it was a mist rising endlessly above me , and the stars drifted upwards , growing ever smaller , in the mist . The faraway voice sharpened , like a note sung in the high mountains , touching my chest where I had laid my hand.  |p220It  pierced me as a beam pierces darkness , singing Come to me ; all things will be forgiven if only you come to me . I am more alone than I have ever been . And there came in time with the voice a sense of limitless possibility , of wonder and expectation that brought with it the vision of Armand standing alone in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illusions . He was in a pale wash of light before the main altar , a lissome shape in regal tatters , shimmering as he vanished , and nothing but patience in his eyes . There was no crypt under les Innocents now . There was no grotesquery of the ragged ghost in the glare of Nicki 's library , throwing down the books when he had finished with them as if they were empty shells . I think I knelt down and rested my head against the jagged stones . I saw the moon like a phantom dissolving , and the sun must have touched her because she hurt me and I had to close my eyes . But I felt an elation , an ecstasy . It was as if my spirit could know the glory of the Dark " Prick without the blood flowing , in the intimacy of the voice dividing me and seeking the tenderest , most secret part of my soul . What do you want of me , I wanted to say again . How can there be this forgiveness when there was such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Horrors I do n't want to imagine . . . I wanted to say it all again . But I could n't shape the words now any more than I could before . And this time , I knew that if I dared to try , the bliss would melt and leave me and the anguish would be worse than the thirst for blood . Yet even as I remained still , in the mystery of this feeling , I knew strange images and thoughts that were n't my own . I saw myself retreat again to the dungeon and lift up the inanimate bodies of those kindred monsters I loved . I saw myself carrying them up to the roof of the tower and leaving them there in their helplessness at the mercy of the rising sun . Hell 's Bells rang the alarm in vain for them . And the sun took them up and made them cinders with human hair . My mind recoiled from this ; it recoiled in the . most heartbreaking disappointment . " Child , still , " I whispered . Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How foolish you are to think that such things could be done by me . " The voice faded ; it withdrew itself from me . And I felt my aloneness in every pore of my skin . It was as if all covering had been taken from me forever and I would always be as naked and miserable as I was now . And I felt far off a convulsion of power , as if the spirit that had made the voice was curling upon itself like a great tongue.  | " Treachery ! " I said louder . " But oh , the sadness of it , the miscalculation . How can you say that you desire me ! " Gone it was . Absolutely gone . And desperately , I wanted it back even if it was to fight with me . I wanted that sense of possibility , that lovely flare again . And I saw his face in Notre Dame , boyish and almost sweet , like the face of an old da Vinci saint . A horrid sense of fatality passed over me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Nicki , out into the quiet of the forest , and I told her all that had taken place the preceding night . I told her all that Armand had suggested and said . In an embarrassed way , I spoke of the silence that existed between her and me , and of how I knew now that it was n't to change . " We should leave Paris as soon as possible , " I said finally . " This creature is too dangerous . And the ones to whom I gave the theater  --  they do n't know anything other than what they 've been taught by him . I say let them have Paris . And let 's take the Devil 's Road , to use the old queen 's words . " I had expected anger from her , and malice towards Armand . But through the whole story she remained calm . " Lestat , there are too many unanswered questions , " she said . " I want to know how this old coven started , I want to know all that Armand knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn my back on it . I do n't care how it started . I wonder if he himself even knows . " " I understand , Lestat , " she said quietly . " Believe me , I do . When all is said and done , I care less about these creatures than I do about the trees in this forest or the stars overhead . I 'd rather study the currents of wind or the patterns in the falling leaves ... " " Exactly . " " But we must n't be hasty . The important thing now is for the three of us to remain together . We should go into the city together and prepare slowly for our departure together . And together , we must try your plan to rouse Nicolas with the violin . " I wanted to talk about Nicki . I wanted to ask her what lay behind his silence , what could she divine ? But the words dried up in my throat . Ip222thought as I had all along of her judgment in those first moments : " Disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and led me back towards the tower . " I do n't have to read your mind , " she said , " to know what 's in your heart . Let 's take him into Paris . Let 's try to find the Stradivarius . " She stood on tiptoe to kiss me . " We were on the Devil 's Road together before all this happened , " she said . " We 'll be on it soon again . " IT WAS as easy to take Nicolas into Paris as to lead him in everything else . Like a ghost he mounted his horse and rode alongside of us , only his dark hair and cape seemingly animate , whipped about as they were by the wind . When we fed in the Ilc de la Cite , I found I could not watch him hunt or kill . It gave me no hope to sec him doing these simple things with the sluggishness of a somnambulist . It proved nothing more than that he could go like this forever , our silent accomplice , little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over me as we moved through the alleyways together . We were not two , but three , now . A coven . And if only I could bring him aroundBut the visit to Roget had to come first . I alone had to confront the lawyer . So I left them to wait only a few doors from his house , and as I pounded the knocker , I braced myself for the most grueling performance yet of my theatrical career . Well , I was very quickly to learn an important lesson about mortals and their willingness to be convinced that the world is a safe place . Roget was overjoyed to see me . He was so relieved that I was " alive and in good health " and still wanted his services , that he was nodding his acceptance before my preposterous explanations had even begun . ( And this lesson about mortal peace of mind I never forgot . Even if a ghost is ripping a house to pieces , throwing tin pans all over , pouring water on pillows , making clocks chime at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " offered , no matter how absurd , rather than the obvious supernatural one , for what is going on . ) Also it became clear almost at once that he believed Gabrielle and I had slipped out of the flat by the servants ' door to the bedroom , a nice possibility I had n't considered before . So all I did about the twisted-up candelabra was mumble something about having been mad with grief when I saw my mother , which he understood right off . As for the reason for our leaving , well , Gabrielle insisted upon beingp223removed from everyone and taken to a convent , and there she was right now . " Ah , Monsieur , it 's a miracle , her improvement , " I said . " If you could only see her  --  but never mind . We 're going on to Italy immediately with N icolas de Lenfent , and we need currency , letters of credit , whatever , and raveling coach , a huge traveling coach , and a good team of six . You take care of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And write to my father and tell him we 're taking my mother to Italy . My father is all right , I presume ? " " Yes , yes , of course , I did n't tell him anything but the most reassur-i ng --  " " How clever of you . I knew I could trust you . What would I do without you ? And what about these rubies , can you turn them into money for me immediately ? And I have here some Spanish coins to sell , quite old , I think . " He scribbled like a madman , his doubts and suspicions fading in the heat of my smiles . He was so glad to have something to do ! " Hold my property in the boulevard du Temple vacant , " I said . " And of course , you 'll manage everything for me . And so forth and so on . " My property in the boulevard du Temple , the hiding place of a ragged and desperate band of vampires unless Armand had already found them and burnt them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that question soon enough . I came down the steps whistling to myself in strictly human fashion , overjoyed that this odious task had been accomplished . And then I realized that Nicki and Gabrielle were nowhere in sight . I stopped and turned around in the street . I saw Gabrielle just at the moment I heard her voice , a young boyish figure emerging full blown from an alleyway as if she had just made herself material on the spot . " Lestat , he 's gone  --  vanished , " she said . I could n't answer her . I said something foolish , like " What do you mean , vanished ! " But my thoughts were more or less drowning out the words in my own head . If I had doubted up until this moment that I loved him , I had been lying to myself . " I turned my back , and it was that quick , I tell you , " she said . She was half aggrieved , half angry . " Did you hear any other ... " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , if he moved on his own , if he was n't taken ... " " I would have heard his fear if Armand had taken him , " she insisted . " But does he feel fear ? Does he feel anything at all ? " I was utterlyp224terrified and utterly exasperated . He 'd vanished in a darkness that spread out all around us like a giant wheel from its axis . I think I clenched my fist . I must have made some uncertain little gesture of panic . " Listen to me , " she said . " There are only two things that go round and round in his mind ... " " Tell me ! " " One is the pyre under les Innocents where he was almost burned . And the other is a small theater  --  footlights , a stage . " " Renaud 's , " I said . SHE and I were archangels together . It did n't take us a quarter of an hour to reach the noisy boulevard and to move through its raucous crowd past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . The boards had all been ripped down and the locks broken . But I heard no sound of Eleni or the others as we slipped quietly into the hallway that went round the back of the stage . No one here . Perhaps Armand had gathered his children home after all , and that was my doing because I would not take them in . Nothing but the jungle of props , the great painted scrims of night and day and hill and dale , and the open dressing rooms , those crowded little closets where here and there a mirror glared in the light that seeped through the open door we had left behind . Then Gabrielle 's hand tightened on my sleeve . She gestured towards the wings proper . And I knew by her face that it was n't the other ones . Nicki was there . I went to the side of the stage . The velvet curtain was drawn back to both sides and I could see his dark figure plainly in the orchestra pit . He was sitting in his old place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me but he did n't notice me . He was staring off as he had done all along . And the memory came back to me of Gabrielle 's strange words the night after I had made her , that she could not get over the sensation that she had died and could affect nothing in the mortal world . He appeared that lifeless and that translucent . He was the still , expressionlessspecter one almost stumbles over in the shadows of the haunted house , all but melded with the dusty furnishings  --  the fright that is worse perhaps than any other kind . I looked to see if the violin was there  --  on the floor , or against his chair  --  and when I saw that it was n't , I thought , Well , there is still a chance . " Stay here and watch , " I said to Gabrielle . But my heart was knockingin my throat when I looked up at the darkened theater , when I let myselfbreathe in the old scents . Why did you have to bring us here , Nicki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I to ask that ? I had come back , had I not ? I lighted the first candle I found in the old prima donna 's dressing room . Open pots of paint were scattered everywhere , and there were many discarded costumes on the hooks . All the rooms I passed were full of cast-off clothing , forgotten combs and brushes , withered flowers still in the vases , powder spilled on the floor . I thought of Eleni and the others again , and I realized that the faintest smell of les Innocents lingered here . And I saw very distinct naked footprintsin the spilled powder . Yes , they 'd come in . And they had lighted candles , too , had n't they ? Because the smell of the wax was too fresh . Whatever the case , they had n't entered my old dressing room , the room that Nicki and I had shared before every performance . It was locked still . And when I broke open the door , I got an ugly shock . The room was exactly the way I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mirror polished , and it was filled with my belongings as it had been on the last night I had been here . There was my old coat on the hook , the cast-off I 'd worn from the country , and a pair of wrinkled boots , and my pots of paint in perfect order , and my wig , which I had worn only at the theater , on its wooden head . Letters from Gabrielle in a little stack , the old copies of English and French newspapers in which the play had been mentioned , and a bottle of wine still half full with a dried cork . And there in the darkness beneath the marble dressing table , partly covered by a bundled black coat , lay a shiny violin case . It was not the one we 'd carried all the way from home with us . No . It must hold the precious gift I 'd bought for him with the " coin of the realm " after , the Stradivarius violin . I bent down and opened the lid . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lying here among all these unimportantthings . I wondered whether Eleni and the others would have taken it had they come into this room . Would they have known what it could do ? I set down the candle for a moment and took it out carefully , and I tightened the horsehair of the bow as I 'd seen Nicki do a thousand times . And then I brought the instrument and the candle back to the stage again , and I bent down and commenced to light the long string of candle footlights . Gabrielle watched me impassively . Then she came to help me . She lit one candle after another and then lighted the sconce in the wings . It seemed Nicki stirred . But maybe it was only the growing illuminationon his profile , the soft light that emanated out from the stage into thep226darkened hall . The deep folds of velvet came alive everywhere ; the ornate little mirrors affixed to the front of the gallery and the loges became lights themselves . Beautiful this little place , our place . The portal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the portal finally to hell . When I was finished , I stood on the boards looking at the gilded railings , the new chandelier that hung from the ceiling , and up at the arch overhead with its masks of comedy and tragedy like two faces stemming from the same neck . It seemed so much smaller when it was empty , this house . No theater in Paris seemed larger when it was full . Outside was the low thunder of the boulevard traffic , tiny human voices rising now and then like sparks over the general hum . A heavy carriage must have passed then because everything within the theater shiveredslightly : the candle flames against their reflectors , the giant stage curtain gathered to right and left , the scrim behind of a finely painted garden with clouds overhead . I went past Nicki , who never once looked up at me , and down the little stairs behind him , and came towards him with the violin . Gabrielle stood back in the wings again , her small face cold but patient . She rested against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange long-haired man . I lowered the violin over Nicki 's shoulder and held it in his lap . I felt him move , as if he had taken a great breath . The back of his head pressed against me . And slowly he lifted his left hand to take the neck of the violin and he took the bow with his right . I knelt and put my hands on his shoulders . I kissed his cheek . No human scent . No human warmth . Sculpture of my Nicolas . " Play it , " I whispered . " Play it here just for us . " Slowly he turned to face me , and for the first time since the moment of the Dark Trick , he looked into my eyes . He made some tiny sound . It was so strained it was as if he could n't speak anymore . The organs of speech had closed up . But then he ran his tongue along his lip , and so low I scarcely heard him , he said : " The devil 's instrument . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must believe that , then believe it . But play . His fingers hovered above the strings . He tapped the hollow wood with his fingertip . And now , trembling , he plucked at the strings to tune them and wound the pegs very slowly as if he were discovering the process with perfect concentration for the first time . Somewhere out on the boulevard children laughed . Wooden wheelsp227made their thick clatter over the cobblestones . The staccato notes were lour , dissonant , and they sharpened the tension . I le pressed the instrument to his ear for a moment . And it seemed to the he did n't move again for an eternity , and then he slowly rose to his feet . I went back out of the pit and into the benches , and I stood staring at his black silhouette against the glow of the lighted stage . He turned to face the empty theater as he had done so many times at the moment of the intermezzo , and he lifted the violin to his chin . And in movement so swift it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he brought the bow down across the strings . The first full-throated chords throbbed in the silence and were stretched as they deepened , scraping the bottom of sound itself . Then the notes rose , rich and dark and shrill , as if pumped out of the fragile violin by alchemy , until a raging torrent of melody suddenly flooded the hall . It seemed to roll through my body , to pass through my very bones . I could n't see the movement of his fingers , the whipping of the bow ; all I could see was the swaying of his body , his tortured posture as he let the music twist him , bend him forward , throw him back . It became higher , shriller , faster , yet the tone of each note was perfection . It was execution without effort , virtuosity beyond mortal dreams . And the violin was talking , not merely singing , the violin was insisting . The violin was telling a tale . The music was a lamentation , a fugue of terror looping itself into hypnotic dance rhythms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I its hair was a glistening mop against the footlights . The blood sweat had broken out on him . I could smell the blood . But I too was doubling over ; I was backing away from him , slumping down on the bench as if to cower from it , as once before in this house terrified mortals had cowered before me . And I knew , knew in some full and simultaneous fashion , that the violin was telling everything that had happened to Nicki . It was the darknessexploded , the darkness molten , and the beauty of it was like the glow of smoldering coals ; just enough illumination to show how much darkness there really was . Gabrielle too was straining to keep her body still under the onslaught , her face constricted , her hands to her head . Her lion 's mane of hair had shaken loose around her , her eyes were closed . But another sound was coming through the pure inundation of song . ' I hey were here . They had come into the theater and were moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaks , the sound throttled for an instantp228and then released again . The mixture of feeling and pure logic drove it past the limits of the bearable . And yet it went on and on . And the others appeared slowly from behind the stage curtain  --  first the stately figure of Eleni , then the boy Laurent , and finally Felix and Eugenie . Acrobats , street players , they had become , and they wore the clothes of such players , the men in white tights beneath dagged harlequin jerkins , the women in full bloomers and ruffled dresses and with dancing slippers on their feet . Rouge gleamed on their immaculate white faces ; kohl outlined their dazzling vampire eyes . They glided towards N icki as if drawn by a magnet , their beauty flowering ever more fully as they came into the glare of the stage candles , their hair shimmering , their movements agile and feline , their expressions rapt . Nicki turned slowly to face them as he writhed , and the song went into frenzied supplication , lurching and climbing and roaring along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if horrified or enchanted . Then her arms rose straight up above her head in a slow dramatic gesture , her body tensing , her neck becoming ever more graceful and long . The other woman had made a pivot and lifted her knee , toe pointed down , in the first step of a dance . But it was the tall man who suddenly caught the pace of Nicki 's music as he jerked his head to the side and moved his legs and arms as if he were a great marionette controlled from the rafters above by four strings . The others saw it . They had seen the marionettes of the boulevard . And suddenly they all went into the mechanical attitude , their sudden movements like spasms , their faces like wooden faces , utterly blank . A great cool rush of delight passed through me , as if I could breathe suddenly in the blasted heat of the music , and I moaned with pleasure watching them flip and flop and throw up their legs , toes to the ceiling , and twirl on their invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music , the very balance between its hideous pleading and its insistent singing , and it was Nicki who commanded their strings . But it was changing . He was playing to them now even as they danced to him . He took a stride towards the stage , and leapt up over the smoky trough of the footlights , and landed in their midst . The light slithered off the instrument , off his glistering face . A new element of mockery infected the never ending melody , a syncopationthat staggered the song and made it all the more bitter and all the more sweet at the same time . The jerking stiff-jointed puppets circled him , shuffling and bobbingp229along the floorboards . Fingers splayed , heads rocking from side to side , they jigged and twisted until all of them broke their rigid form as Nicki 's melody melted into harrowing sadness , the dance becoming immediately liquid and heartbroken and slow . It was as if one mind controlled them , as if they danced to Nicki 's thoughts as well as his music , and he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming faster , as he became the country fiddler at the Lenten bonfire , and they leapt in pairs like country lovers , the skirts of the women flaring , the men bowing their legs as they lifted the women , all creating postures of tenderest love . Frozen , I stared at the image : the preternatural dancers , the monster violinist , limbs moving with inhuman slowness , tantalizing grace . The i i i usic was like a fire consuming us all . Now it screamed of pain , of horror , of the pure rebellion of the soul against all things . And they again carried it into the visual , faces twisted in torment , like the mask of tragedy graven on the arch above them , and I knew that if I did n't turn my back on this I would cry . I did n't want to hear any more or see any more . Nicki was swinging to and fro as if the violin were a beast he could no longer control . And he was stabbing at the strings with short rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , in back of him , embraced him , and caught him suddenly as he threw up his hands , the violin held high over his head . A loud piercing laughter erupted from him . His chest shivered with it , his arms and legs quaking with it . And then he lowered his head and he fixed his eyes on me . And at the top of his voice he screamed : " I GIVE YOU THE THEATER OF THE VAMPIRES ! THE THEATER OF THE VAMPIRES ! THE GREATEST SPECTACLE OF THE BOULEVARD ! " Astonished , the others stared at him . But again , all of one mind , they clapped their hands and roared . They leapt into the air , giving out shrieks of joy . They threw their arms about his neck and kissed him . And dancing a round him in a circle , they turned him with their arms . The laughter rose , bubbling out of all of them , as he brought them close in his arms and answered their kisses , and with their long pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Theater of the Vampires ! " They broke from him and bawled it to the nonexistent audience , to the world . They bowed to the footlights , and frolicking and screaming they leapt up to the rafters and then let themselves drop down with a storm of reverberation on the boards . The last shimmer of the music was gone , replaced by this cacophony pf shrieking and stomping and laughter , like the clang of bells.  |p230I  do not remember turning my back on them . I do n't remember walking up the steps to the stage and going past them . But I must have . Because I was suddenly sitting on the long narrow table of my little dressing room , my back against the corner , my knee crooked , my head against the cold glass of the mirror , and Gabrielle was there . I was breathing hoarsely and the sound of it bothered me . I saw things  --  the wig I 'd worn on the stage , the pasteboard shield  --  and these evoked thundering emotions . But I was suffocating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , and he moved Gabrielle to the side with a strength that astonished her and astonished me , and he pointed his finger at me : " Well , do n't you like it , my lord patron ? " he asked , advancing , his words flowing in an unbroken stream so that they sounded like one great word . " Do n't you admire its splendor , its perfection ? Wo n't you endow the Theater of the Vampires with the coin of the realm which you possess in such great abundance ? Wo n't you see your playhouse come to its final magnificent purpose ? How was it now , the new evil , the canker in the heart of the rose , death in the very midst of things ' ... " From a mute he had passed into mania , and even when he broke off talking , the low senseless frenzied sounds still issued from his lips like water from a spring . His face was drawn and hard and glistening with the blood droplets clinging to it , and staining the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an almost innocent laughter from the others , except for Eleni , who watched over his shoulder , trying very hard to comprehend what was really happening between us . He drew closer , half laughing , grinning , stabbing at my chest with his finger : " Well , speak . Do n't you see the splendid mockery , the genius ? " He struck his own chest with his fist . " They 'll come to our performances , fill our coffers with gold , and never guess what they harbor , what flourishes right in the corner of the Parisian eye . In the back alleys we feed on them and they clap for us before the lighted stage ... " Laughter from the boy behind him . The tink of a tambourine , the thin sound of the other woman singing . A long streak of the man 's laughter  --  like a ribbon unfurling , charting his movement as he rushed around in a circle through the rattling scrims . Nicki drew in so that the light behind him vanished . I could n't see Eleni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was full of menace and his white hands looked like the claws of a sea creature that could at any given moment move to tear me to bits . " To serve the god of the dark wood as he has not been served ever and here in the very center of civilization . And for this youp231raved the theater . Out of your gallant patronage this sublime offering is born . " " It is petty ! " I said . " It is merely beautiful and clever and nothing more . " My voice had not been very loud but it brought him to silence , and it brought the others to silence . And the shock in me melted slowly into another emotion , no less painful , merely easier to contain . Nothing but the sounds again from the boulevard . A glowering anger flowed out of him , his pupils dancing as he looked at me . " You 're a liar , a contemptible liar , " he said . " There is no splendor in it , " I answered . " There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then going out from here at night to take life in the same old petty manner , one death after another in all its inevitable cruelty and shabbiness so that we can live . Any man can kill another man ! Play your violin forever . Dance as you wish . Give them their money 's worth if it keeps you busy and eats up eternity ! It 's simply clever and beautiful . A grove in the Savage Garden . Nothing more . " " Vile liar ! " he said between his teeth . " You are God 's fool , that 's what you are . You who possessed the dark secret that soared above everything , rendered everything meaningless , and what did you do with it , in those months when you ruled alone from Magnus 's tower , but try to live like a good man ! A good man ! " He was close enough to kiss me , the blood of his spittle hitting my face . " Patron of the arts , " he sneered . " Giver of gifts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stepped back , looking down on me contemptuously . " Well , we will take the little theater that you painted in gold , and hung with velvet , " he said , " and it will serve the forces of the devil more splendidlythan he was ever served by the old coven . " He turned and glanced at Eleni . He glanced back at the others . " We will make a mockery of all things sacred . We will lead them to ever greater vulgarity and profanity . We will astonish . We will beguile . But above all , we will thrive on their gold as well as their blood and in their midst we will grow strong . " " Yes , " said the boy behind him . " We will become invincible . " His face had a crazed look , the look of the zealot as he gazed at Nicolas . " We will have names and places in their very world . " " And power over them , " said the other woman , " and a vantage point from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods of destroying them when we choose . " " I want the theater , " Nicolas said to me . " I want it from you . The deed , the money to reopen it . My assistants here are ready to listen to me . " " You may have it , if you wish , " I answered . " It is yours if it will take you and your malice and your fractured reason off my hands . "  |p232I  got up off the dressing table and went towards him and I think that he meant to block my path , but something unaccountable happened . When I saw he would n't move , my anger rose up and out of me like an invisible fist . And I saw him moved backwards as if the fist had struck him . And he hit the wall with sudden force . I could have been free of the place in an instant . I knew Gabrielle was only waiting to follow me . But I did n't leave . I stopped and I looked back at him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't move . And he was watching me and the hatred was as pure , as undiluted by remembered love , as it had been all along . But I wanted to understand , I wanted really to know what had happened . And I came towards him again in silence and this time it was I who was menacing , and my hands looked like claws and I could feel his fear . They were all , except for  --  eni , full of fear . I stopped when I was very close to him and he looked directly at me , and it was as if he knew exactly what I was asking him . " All a misunderstanding , my love , " he said . Acid on the tongue . The blood sweat had broken out again , and his eyes glistened as if they were wet . " It was to hurt others , do n't you sec , the violin playing , to anger them , to secure for me an island where they could not rule . They would watch my ruin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't answer . I wanted him to go on . " And when we decided to go to Paris , I thought we would starve in Paris , that we would go down and down and down . It was what I wanted , rather than what they wanted , that I , the favored son , should rise for them . I thought we would go down ! We were supposed to go down . " " Oh , Nicki . . . " I whispered . " But you did n't go down , Lestat , " he said , his eyebrows rising . " The hunger , the cold  --  none of it stopped you . You were a triumph ! " The rage thickened his voice again . " You did n't drink yourself to death in the gutter . You turned everything upside down ! And for every aspect of our proposed damnation you found exuberance , and there was no end to your enthusiasmsand the passion coming out of you  --  and the light , always the light . And in exact proportion to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in me ! Every exuberance piercing me and creating its exact proportion of darkness and despair ! And then , the magic , when you got the magic , irony of ironies , you protected me from it ! And what did you do with it but use your Satanic powers to simulate the actions of a good man ! " I turned around . I saw them scattered in the shadows , and farthest away , the figure of Gabrielle . I saw the light on her hand as she raised it , beckoning for me to come away.  |p233Nicki  reached up and touched my shoulders . I could feel the hatred coining through his touch . Loathsome to be touched in hate . " Like a mindless beam of sunlight you routed the bats of the old coven ! " he whispered . " And for what purpose ? What does it mean , the murdering monster who is filled with light ! " I turned and smacked him and sent him hurtling into the dressing room , his right hand smashing the mirror , his head cracking against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something broken against the mass of old clothing , and then his eyes gathered their determination again , and his face softened into a slow smile . He righted himself and slowly , as an indignant tturrtal might , he smoothed his coat and his rumpled hair . It was like my gestures under les Innocents when my captors had set the down in the dirt . And he came forward with the same dignity , and the smile was as ugly as any I had ever seen . " I despise you , " he said . " But I am done with you . I have the power from you and I know how to use it , which you do not . I am in a realm at last where I choose to triumph ! In darkness , we 're equal now . And you will give me the theater , that because you owe it to me , and you are a giver of things , are n't you  --  a giver of gold coins to hungry children  --  and then I wo n't ever look upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched out his arms to the others : " Come , my beauties , come , we have plays to write , business to attend to . You have things to learn from me . I know what mortals really are . We must get down to the serious invention of our dark and splendid art . We will make a coven to rival all covens . We will do what has never been done . " The others looked at me , frightened , hesitant . And in this still and tense moment I heard myself take a deep breath . My vision broadened . I saw the wings around us again , the high rafters , the walls of scenery transecting the darkness , and beyond , the little blaze along the foot of the dusty stage . I saw the house veiled in shadow and knew in one limitless recollection all that had happened here . And I saw a nightmare hatch another nightmare , and I saw a story come to an end . " The Theater of the Vampires , " I whispered . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No one of the others dared to answer . Nicolas only smiled . And as I turned to leave the theater I raised my hand in a gesture that urged them all towards him . I said my farewell.  |p234WE  WERE not far from the lights of the boulevard when I stopped in my tracks . Without words a thousand horrors came to me  --  that Armand would come to destroy him , that his newfound brothers and sisters would tire of his frenzy and desert him , that morning would find him stumbling through the streets unable to find a hiding place from the sun . I looked up at the sky . I could n't speak or breathe . Gabrielle put her arms around me and I held her , burying my face in her hair . Like cool velvet was her skin , her face , her lips . And her love surrounded me with a monstrous purity that had nothing to do with human hearts and human flesh . I lifted her off her feet embracing her . And in the dark , we were like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a separate life at all . " He 's made his choice , my son , " she said . " What 's done is done , and j you 're free of him now . " " Mother , how can you say it ? " 1 whispered . " He did n't know . He does n't know still ... " " Let him go , Lestat , " she said . " " They will care for him . " " But now I have to find that devil , Armand , do n't I ? " I said wearily . " I have to make him leave them alone . " THE following evening when I came into Paris , I learned that Nicki had already been to Roget . He had come an hour earlier pounding on the doors like a madman . And shouting from the shadows , he had demanded the deed to the theater , and money that he said I had promised to him . He had threatened Roget and his family . He had also told Roget to write to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come home , that they had a new theater awaiting them , and he expected them back at once . When Roget refused , he demanded the address of the players in London , and began to ransack Roget 's desk . I went into a silent fury when I heard this . So he would make them all vampires , would he , this demon fledgling , this reckless and frenzied monster ? This would not come to pass . I told Roget to send a courier to London , with word that Nicolas de Lenfent had lost his reason . The players must not come home . And then I went to the boulevard du Temple and I found him at his rehearsals , excited and mad as he had been before . He wore his fancy clothes again and his old jewels from the time when he had been his father 's favorite son , but his tie was askew , his stockings crooked , and his hair was as wildp235and unkempt as the hair of a prisoner in the Bastille who had n't seen himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others I told him he would get nothing from me unless I had the promise that no actor or actress of Paris would ever be slain or seduced by the new coven , that Renaud and his troupe would never be brought into the Theater of the Vampires now or in the years to come , that Itoget , who would hold the purse strings of the theater , must never come to the slightest harm . He laughed at me , he ridiculed me as he had before . But Eleni silenced biro . She was horrified to learn of his impulsive designs . It was she who gave the promises , and exacted them from the others . It was she who intimidated him and confused him with jumbled language of the old ways , and made him back down . AND it was to Eleni finally that I gave control of the Theater of the Vampires , and the income , to pass through Roget , which would allow her to do with it what she pleased . BEFORE I left her that night , I asked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were in the alleyway again , near the stage door . " He watches , " Eleni answered . " Sometimes he lets himself be seen . " I Icr face was very confusing to me . Sorrowful . " But God only knows what he will do , " she added fearfully , " when he discovers what is really going on here . "  |p239SPRING  rain . Rain of light that saturated every new leaf of the trees in the street , every square of paving , drift of rain threading light through the empty darkness itself . And the ball in the Palais Royal . The king and queen were there , dancing with the people . Talk in the shadows of intrigue . Who cares ? Kingdoms rise and fall . Just do n't burn the paintings in the Louvre , that 's all . Lost in a sea of mortals again ; fresh complexions and ruddy cheeks , mounds of powdered hair atop feminine heads with all manner of millinery nonsense in them , even minute ships with three masts , tiny trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men like cocks in satin coats like feathered wings . The diamonds hurt my eyes . The voices touched the surface of my skin at times , the laughter the echo of unholy laughter , wreaths of candles blinding , the froth of music positively lapping the walls . Gust of rain from the open doors . Scent of humans gently stoking my hunger . White shoulders , white necks , powerful hearts running at that eternal rhythm , so many gradations among these naked children hidden in riches , savages laboring beneath a swaddling of chenille , encrustations of embroidery , feet aching over high heels , masks like scabs about their eyes . The air comes out of one body and is breathed into another . The music , does it pass out of one ear and into another , as the old expression goes ? We breathe the light , we breathe the music , we breathe the moment as it passes through us . Now and then eyes settled on me with some vague air of expectation . My white skin made them pause , but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves to keep their delicate pallor ? ( Let me hold the basin for you and drink it afterwards . ) And my eyes , what were those , in this sea of paste jewels ? Yet their whispers slithered around me . And those scents , ah , not a onep240was like another . And as clearly as if spoken aloud it came , the summons from mortals here and there , sensing what I was , and the lust . In some ancient language they welcomed death ; they ached for death as death was passing through the room . But did they really know ? Of course they did n't know . And I did not know ! That was the perfect horror ! And who am I to bear this secret , to hunger so to impart it , to want to take that slender woman there and suck the blood right out of the plump flesh of her round little breast . The music rushed on , human music . The colors of the room flamed for an instant as if the whole would melt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My veins were throbbing with it . Someone would die . Sucked dry in less than a moment . I can not stand it , thinking of it , knowingit 's about to happen , fingers on the throat feeling the blood in the vein , feeling the flesh give , give it to me ! Where ? This is my body , this is my blood . Send out your power , I , cstat , like a reptile tongue to gather in a flick the appropriate heart . Plump little arms ripe for the squeezing , men 's faces on which the close-shaven blond beard all but glitters , muscle struggling in my fingers , you have n't got a chance ! And beneath this divine chemistry suddenly , this panorama of the denial of decay , I saw the bones ! Skulls under these preposterous wigs , two gaping holes peering from behind the uplifted fan . A room of wobbling skeletons waiting only for the tolling of the bell . Just as I had seen the audience that night in the pit of Renaud 's when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror should be visited upon every other being in this room . I had to get out . I 'd made a terrible miscalculation . This was death and I could get away from it , if I could just get out ! But I was tangled in mortal beings as if this monstrous place were a snare for a vampire . If I bolted , I 'd send the entire ballroom into panic . As gently as I could I pushed to the open doors . And against the far wall , a backdrop of satin and filigree , I saw , out of the corner of my eye , like something imagined , Armand . Armand . If there had been a summons , I never heard it . If there was a greeting , I did n't sense it now . He was merely looking at me , a radiant creature in jewels and scalloped lace . And it was Cinderella revealed at the ball , this vision , Sleeping Beauty opening her eyes under a mesh of cobwebs and wiping them all away with one sweep of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made me gasp . Yes , perfect mortal raiment , and yet he seemed all the more supernatu/ral , his face too dazzling , his dark eyes fathomless and just for a split second glinting as if they were windows to the fires of hell . And when his voice came it was low and almost teasing , forcing me to concentrate to hear it- : Ill night you 've been searching for me , he said , and here I am , waiting for you . l have been waiting for you all along . I think I sensed even then , as I stood unable to look away , that never in my years of wandering this earth would I ever have such a rich revelation of the true horror that we are . Heartbreakingly innocent he seemed in the midst of the crowd . Yet I saw crypts when I looked at him , and I heard the beat of the kettledrums . I saw torchlit fields where I had never been , heard vague incantations , felt the heat of raging fires on my face . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rather I drew them out on my own . Yet never had Nicolas , mortal or immortal , been so alluring . Never had Gabrielle held me so in thrall . Dear God , this is love . This is desire . And all my past amours have been but the shadow of this . And it seemed in a murmuring pulse of thought he gave me to know that I had been very foolish to think it would not be so . Who can love us , you and I , as we can love each other , he whispered and it seemed his lips actually moved . Others looked at him . I saw them drifting with a ludicrous slowness ; I saw their eyes pass over him , I saw the light fall on him at a rich new angle as he lowered his head . I was moving towards him . It seemed he raised his right hand and beckoned and then he did n't , and he had turned and I saw the figure of a young boy ahead of me , with narrow waist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a boy who turned as he opened a door and beckoned again . A mad thought came to me . I was moving after him , and it seemed that none of the other things had happened . There was no crypt under les Innocents , and he had not been that ancient fearful fiend . We were somehow safe . We were the sum of our desires and this was saving us , and the vast tintasted horror of my own immortality did not lie before me , and we were navigating calm seas with familiar beacons , and it was time to be in each other 's arms . A dark room surrounded us , private , cold . The noise of the ball was far away . He was heated with the blood he 'd drunk and I could hear the strong force of his heart . He drew me closer to him , and beyond the high windows there flashed the passing lights of the carriages , with dim incessant sounds that spoke of safety and comfort , and all the things that Paris was.  |p242I  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put out my arms and felt his heart against me , and calling out to my Nicolas , I tried to warn him , to tell him we were all of us doomed . Our life was slipping inch by inch from us , and seeing the apple trees in the orchard , drenched in green sunlight , I felt I would go mad . " No , no , my dearest one , " he was whispering , " nothing but peace and sweetness and your arms in mine . " " You know it was the damnedest luck ! " I whispered suddenly . " I am an unwilling devil . I cry like some vagrant child . I want to go home . " Yes , yes , his lips tasted like blood , but it was not human blood . It was that elixir that Magnus had given me , and I felt myself recoil . I could get away this time . I had another chance . The wheel had turned full round . I was crying out that I would n't drink ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shafts driven hard through my neck and down to my soul . I could n't move . It was coming as it had come that night , the rapture , a thousandfold what it was when I held mortals in my arms . And I knew what he was doing ! He was feeding upon me ! He was draining me . And going down on my knees , I felt myself held by him , the blood pouring out of me with a monstrous volition 1 could n't stop . " Devil ! " I tried to scream . I forced the word up and up until it broke from my lips and the paralysis broke from my limbs . " Devil ! " I roared again and I caught him in his swoon and hurled him backwards to the floor . In an instant , I had my hands upon him and , shattering the French doors , had dragged him out with me into the night . His heels were scraping on the stones , his face had become pure fury . I clutched his right arm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped back and he could not see nor gauge where he was , nor catch hold of anything , and with my right hand I beat him and beat him , until the blood was running out of his ears and his eyes and his nose . I dragged him through the trees away from the lights of the Palais . And as he struggled , as he sought to resurrect himself with a burst of force , he shot his declaration at me that he would kill me because he had my strength now . He 'd drunk it out of me and coupled with his own strength it would make him impossible to defeat . Maddened , I clutched at his neck , pushing his head down against the path beneath me . I pinned him down , strangling him , until the blood in great gushes poured out of his open mouth . He would have screamed if he could . My knees drove into his chest . His neck bulged under my fingers and the blood spurted and bubbled out of him and he turned his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger , but seeing nothing , and then when I felt him weak and limp , I let him go.  |p243I  beat him again , turning him this way and that . And then I drew my sword to sever his head . Let him live like that if he can . Let him be immortal like that if he can . I raised the sword and when I looked down at him , the rain was pelting his face , and he was staring up at me , as one half alive , unable to plead for mercy , unable to move . I waited . I wanted him to beg . I wanted him to give me that powerful voice full of lies and cunning , the voice that had made me believe for one pure and dazzling instant that I was alive and free and in the state of grace again . Damnable , unforgivable lie . Lie I 'd never forget for as long as I walked the earth . I wanted the rage to carry me over the threshold to his grave . But nothing came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misery for him , his beauty slowly returned . He lay a broken child on the gravel path , only yards from the passing traffic , the ring of the horses ' hooves , the rumble of the wooden wheels . And in this broken child were centuries of evil and centuries of knowledge , and out of him there came no ignominious entreaty but merely the soft and bruised sense of what he was . Old , old evil , eyes that had seen dark ages of which I only dream . I let him go , and I stood up and sheathed my sword . I walked a few paces from him , and collapsed upon a wet stone bench . Far away , busy figures labored about the shattered window of the palace . But the night lay between us and those confused mortals , and I looked at him listlessly as he lay still . His face was turned to me , but not by design , his hair a tangle of curls and blood . And with his eyes closed , and his hand open beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supernatural accident , someoneas miserable as myself . What had he done to become what he was ? Could one so young so long ago have guessed the meaning of any decision , let alone the vow to become this ? I rose , and walking slowly to him , I stood over him and looked at him , at the blood that soaked his lace shirt and stained his face . It seemed he sighed , that I heard the passage of his breath . He did n't open his eyes , and to mortals perhaps there would have been no expression there . But I felt his sorrow . I felt its immensity , and I wished I did n't feel it , and for one moment I understood the gulf that divided us , and the gulf that divided his attempt to overpower me from my rather simple defense of myself.  |p244Des|perately  he had tried to vanquish what he did not comprehend . And impulsively and almost effortlessly I had beaten him back . All my pain with Nicolas came back to me and Gabrielle 's words andNicolas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his despair . And this perhaps was the reason that I reached down and gathered himup . And maybe I did it because he was so exquisitely beautiful and so lost , and we were after all of the same ilk . Natural enough , was n't it , that one of his own should take him away from this place where mortals would sooner or later have approached him , driven him stumbling away . He gave no resistance to me . I n a moment he was standing on his own feet . And then he walked drowsily beside me , my arm about his shoulder , bolstering him and steadying him until we were moving away from the Palais Royal , towards the rue St.-I lonore . I only half glanced at the figures passing us , until I saw a familiar shape under the trees , with no scent of mortality coining from it , and I realized that Gabrielle had been there for some time . She came forward hesitantly and silently , her face stricken when she saw the blood-drenched lace and the lacerations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if to help me with the burden of him though she did not seem to know how . Somewhere far off in the darkened gardens , the others were near . I heard them before I saw them . Nicki was there too . They had come as Gabrielle had come , drawn over the miles , it seemed , by the tumult , or what vague messages I could not imagine , and they merely waited and watched as we moved away. 2.11E TOOK him with us to the livery stables , and there I put him on my mare . But he looked as if he would let himself fall off at any moment , and so I mounted behind him , and the three of us rode out . All the way through the country , I wondered what I would do . I wondered what it meant to bring him to my lair . Gabrielle did n't give any protest . Now and then she glanced over at him . I heard nothing from him , and he was small and self-contained as he sat in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . Surely he had always known where the tower was , but had its bars kept him out ? Now I meant to take him inside it . And why did n't Gabrielle sayp245something to me ? It was the meeting we had wanted , it was the thing for which we had waited , but surely she knew what he had just done . When we finally dismounted , he walked ahead of me , and he waited for me to reach the gate . I had taken out the iron key to the lock and I studied him , wondering what promises one exacts from such a monster before opening one 's door . Did the ancient laws of hospitality mean anything to the creatures of the night ? His eyes were large and brown and defeated . Almost drowsy they seemed . He regarded me for a long silent moment and then he reached out with his left hand , and his fingers curled around the iron crossbar in the center of the gate . I stared helplessly as with a loud grinding noise the gate started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contented himself with merely bending the iron bar a little . The point had been made . He could have entered this tower anytime that he wished . I examined the iron bar that he 'd twisted . I had beaten him . Could I do what he had just done ? I did n't know . And unable to calculate my own powers , how could I ever calculate his ? " Come , " Gabrielle said a little impatiently . And she led the way down the stairs to the dungeon crypt . It was cold here as always , the fresh spring air never touching the place . She made a big fire in the old hearth while I lighted the candles . And as he sat on the stone bench watching us , I saw the effect of the warmth on him , the way that his body seemed to " grow slightly larger , the way that he breathed it in . As he looked about , it was as if he were absorbing the light . His gaze was clear . Impossible to overestimate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old coven had forsworn both . I settled on another bench , and I let my eyes roam about the broad low chamber as his eyes roamed . Gabrielle had been standing all this while . And now she approached him . She had taken out a handkerchief and she touched this to his face . He stared at her in the same way that he stared at the fire and the candles , and the shadows leaping on the curved ceiling . This seemed to interest him as simply as anything else . And I felt a shudder when I realized the bruises on his face were now almost gone ! The bones were whole again , the shape of the face having been fully restored , and he was only a little gaunt from the blood he had lost . My heart expanded slightly , against my will , as it had on the battlementswhen I had heard his voice.  |p246I  thought of the pain only half an hour ago in the Palais when the lie had broken with the stab of his fangs into my neck . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Gabrielle combed his hair for him . She took his hands and wiped the blood from them . And he seemed helpless as all this was done . And she had not so much the expression of a ministeringangel as an expression of curiosity , a desire to be near him and to touch him and examine him . In the quavering illumination they looked at one another . He hunched forward a little , eyes darkening and full of expression now as they turned again to the grate . I lad it not been for the blood on his lace ruff , he might have looked human . Might .. . " What will you do now ? " I asked . I spoke to make it clear to Gabrielle . " Will you remain in Paris and let l ieni and the others go on ? " No answer from him . He was studying me , studying the stone benches , the sarcophagi . Three sarcophagi . " Surely you know what they 're doing , " 1 said . " Will you leave Paris or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again the magnitude of what I had done to him and the others , but this faded away . For one moment his face was wretched . It was defeated and warm and full of human misery . How old was he , I wondered . How long ago had he been a human who looked like that ? He heard me . But he did n't give an answer . He looked to Gabrielle , who stood near the fire , and then to me . And silently , he said , Love me . You have destroyed everything ! But if you love me , it can all be restored in a new form . Love me . This silent entreaty had an eloquence , however , that I ca n't put into words . " What can I do to make you love me ? " he whispered . " What can I give ? The knowledge of all I have witnessed , the secrets of our powers , the mystery of what I am ? " It seemed blasphemous to answer . And as I had on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears . For all the purity of his silent communications , his voice gave a lovely resonance to his sentiments when he actually spoke . It occurred to me as it had in Notre Dame that he spoke the way angels must speak , if they exist . But I was awakened from this irrelevant thought , this obviating thought , by the fact that he was now beside me . He was closing his arm round me , and pressing his forehead against my face . He gave that summonsagain , not the rich , thudding seduction of that moment in the Palaisp247Royal , but the voice that had sung to me over the miles , and he told me there were things the two of us would know and understand as mortals never could . He told me that if I opened to him and gave him my strength and my secrets that he would give me his . He had been driven to try to destroy me , and he loved me all the more that he could not . That was a tantalizing thought . Yet I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Beware . I do n't know what Gabrielle saw or heard . I do n't know what she felt . Instinctively I avoided his eyes . There seemed nothing in the world I wanted more at this moment than to look right at him and understand him , and yet I knew I must not . I saw the bones under les Innocents again , the flickering hellfires I had imagined in the Palais Royal . And all the lace and velvet in the eighteenth century could not give him a human face . I could n't keep this from him , and it pained me that it was impossible for me to explain it to Gabrielle . And the awful silence between me and Gabrielle was at that moment almost too much to bear . With him , I could speak , yes , with him I could dream dreams . Some reverence and terror in me made me reach out and embrace him , and I held him , battling my confusion and my desire . " Leave Paris , yes , " he whispered . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exist here now . I stumble through a carnival of horrors . Please ... " I heard myself say : " No . " " Have I no value to you ? " he asked . He turned to Gabrielle . Her face was anguished and still as she looked at him . I could n't know what went on in her heart , and to my sadness , I realized that he was speaking to her and locking me out . What was her answer ? But he was imploring both of us now . " Is there nothing outside yourself you would respect ? " " I might have destroyed you tonight , " I said . " It was respect which kept me from that . " " No . " He shook his head in a startlingly human fashion . " That you never could have done . " I smiled . It was probably true . But we were destroying him quite completely in another way . " Yes , " he said , " that 's true . You are destroying me . Help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few short years of all you have before you , the two of you . I beg you . That is all I ask . " " No , " I said again . He was only a foot from me on the bench . He was looking at me . And there came the horrible spectacle again of his face narrowing and darkening and caving in upon itself in rage . It was as if he had no real substance . Onlyp248will kept him robust and beautiful . And when the flow of his will was interrupted , he melted like a wax doll . But , as before , he recovered himself almost instantly . The " hallucination " was past . He stood up and backed away from me until he was in front of the fire . The will coming from him was palpable . His eyes were like something that did n't belong to him , nor to anything on earth . And the fire blazing behind him made an eerie nimbus around his head . " I curse you ! " he whispered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " he said again and carne closer . " Love mortals then , and live as you have lived , recklessly , with appetite for everything and love for everything , but there will conic a time when only the love of your own kind can save you . " lie glanced at Gabrielle . " And I do n't mean children such as this ! " This was so strong that 1 could n't conceal its effect on me , and I realized I was rising from the bench and slipping away from him towards Gabrielle . " I do n't come empty-handed to you , " he pressed , his voice deliberately softening . " I do n't come begging with nothing to give of my own . Look at me . Tell me you do n't need what you see in me , one who has the strength to take you through the ordeals that lie ahead . " His eyes flashed on Gabrielle and for one moment he remained locked to her and I saw her harden and begin to tremble . " Let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what I say to her , " he said coldly . " I do not try to hurt her . But in your love of mortals , what have you already done ? " He would say something terrible if I did n't stop him , something to wound me or Gabrielle . He knew all that had happened with Nicki . I knew that he did . If , somewhere deep down in my soul , I wished for the end of Nicki , he would know that too ! Why had I let him in ? Why had I not lnown what he could do ? " Oh , but it 's always a travesty , do n't you see ? " he said with that same gentleness . " Each time the death and the awakening will ravage the mortal spirit , so that one will hate you for taking his life , another will run to excesses that you scorn . A third will emerge mad and raving , another a monster you can not control . One will be jealous of your superiority , anothershut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Gabrielle again and half smiled . " And the veil will always come down between you . Make a legion . You will be , always and forever , alone ! "  | " I do n't want to hear this . It means nothing , " 1 said . Gabrielle 's face had undergone some ugly change . She was staring at him with hatred now , I was sure of it . He made that bitter little noise that is a laugh but is n't a laugh at all . " Lovers with a human face , " he mocked me . " Do n't you see your error ? The other one hates you beyond all reason , and she  --  why , the dark blood has made her even colder , has it not ? But even for her , strong as she is , there will come moments when she fears to be immortal , and who will she blame for what was done to her ? " " You are a fool , " Gabrielle whispered . " You tried to protect the violinist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do n't say any more , " I answered . " You make me hate you . Is that what you want ? " " But I speak the truth and you know it . And what you will never know , either of you , is the full depth of each other 's hatreds and resentments . Or suffering . Or love . " He paused and I could say nothing . He was doing exactly what I feared he would , and I did n't know how to defend myself . " If you leave me now with this one , " he continued , " you will do it again . Nicolas you never possessed . And she already wonders how she will ever get free of you . And unlike her , you can not stand to be alone . " I could n't answer . Gabrielle 's eyes became smaller , her mouth a little more cruel . " So the time will come when you will seek other mortals , " he went on , " hoping once more that the Dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these newly mutilated and unpredictable children you 'll try to fashion your citadels against time . Well , they will be prisons if they last for half a century . I warn you . It is only with those as powerful and wise as yourself that the true citadel against time can be built . " The citadel against time . Even in my ignorance the words had their power . And the fear in me expanded , reached out to compass a thousand other causes . He seemed distant for a moment , indescribably beautiful in the firelight , the dark auburn strands of his hair barely touching his smooth forehead , his lips parted in a beatific smile . " If we can not have the old ways , ca n't we have each other ? " he asked , and now his voice was the voice of the summons again . " Who else can understand your suffering ? Who else knows what passed through your mind the night you stood on the stage of your little theater and you frightened all those you had loved ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I whispered . But I was softening all over , drifting into his eyes and his voice . Very near to me was the ecstasy I 'd felt that night on the battlements . With all my will I reached out for Gabrielle . " Who understands what passed through your mind when my renegadefollowers , reveling in the music of your precious fiddler , devised their ghastly boulevard enterprise ? " he asked . I did n't speak . " The Theater of the Vampires ! " His lips lengthened in the saddest smile . " Does she comprehend the irony of it , the cruelty ? Does she know what it was like when you stood on that stage as a young man and you heard the audience screaming for you ? When time was your friend , not your enemy as it is now ? When in the wings , you put out your arms and your mortal darlings came to you , your little family , folding themselves against you ... " " Stop , please . I ask you to stop . " " Does anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Had it ever been used with more skill ? And what was he really saying to us beneath this liquid flow of beautiful language : Come to me , and I shall be the sun round which you are locked in orbit , and my rays shall lay bare the secrets you keep from each other , and I , who possess charms and powers of which you have no inkling , shall control and possess and destroy you ! " I asked you before , " I said . " What do you want ? Really want ? " " You ! " he said . " You and her ! That we become three at this cross-roads ! " Not that we surrender to you ? I shook my head . And I saw the same wariness and recoiling in Gabrielle . He was not angry ; there was no malice now . Yet he said again , in the same beguiling voice : " I curse you , " and I felt it as if he 'd declaimed it . " I offered myself to you at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Remember that when your dark children strike out at you , when they rise up against you . Remember me . " I was shaken , more shaken even than I had been in the sad and awful finish with Nicolas at Renaud 's . I had never once known fear in the crypt under les Innocents . But I had known it in this room since we came in . And some anger boiled in him again , something too dreadful for him to control . I watched him bow his head and turn away . He became small , light , and held his arms close to himself as he stood before the blaze and he thought of threats now to hurt me , and I heard them though they died before they ever reached his lips.  |p251But  something disturbed my vision for a fraction of a second . Maybe it was a candle guttering . Maybe it was the blink of my eye . Whatever it was , he vanished . Or he tried to vanish , and I saw him leaping away from the fire in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried out . And lunging at something I could n't even see , I held him , material again , in my hands . He had only moved very fast , and I had moved faster , and we stood facing each other in the doorway of the crypt , and again I said that single negation and I would n't let him go . " Not like this , we ca n't part . We ca n't leave each other in hatred , we ca n't . " And my will dissolved suddenly as I embraced him and held tight to him so that he could n't free himself nor even move . I did n't care what he was , or what he had done in that doomed moment of lying to me , or even trying to overpower me , I did n't care that I was no longer mortal and would never be again . I wanted only that he should remain . I wanted to be with him , what he was , and all the things he had said were true . Yet it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not have this power over us . He could not divide Gabrielle from me . Yet I wondered , did he himself really understand what he was asking ? Was it possible that he believed the more innocent words he spoke ? Without speaking , without asking his consent , I led him back to the bench by the fire . I felt danger again , terrible danger . But it did n't really matter . He had to remain here with us now . GABRIELLE was murmuring to herself . She was walking back and forth and her cloak hung from one shoulder and she seemed almost to have forgotten we were there . Armand watched her , and when she turned to him , quite suddenly and unexpectedly , she spoke aloud . " You come to him and you say , Take me with you . ' You say , Love me , ' and you hint of superior knowledge , secrets , yet you give us nothing , either of us , except lies . " " I showed my power to understand , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did tricks with your understanding , " she replied . " You made pictures . And rather childish pictures . You have done this all along . You lure Lestat in the Palais with the most gorgeous illusions only to attack him . And here , when there is a respite in the struggle , what do you do but try to sow dissension between us ... " " Yes , illusions before , I admit it , " he answered . " But the things I 've spoken here are true . Already you despise your son for his love of mortals ,  |p252his  need to be ever near them , his yielding to the violinist . You knew the Dark Gift would madden that one , and that it will finally destroy him . You do wish for your freedom , from all the Children of Darkness . You ca n't hide that from me . " " Ah , but you 're so simple , " she said . " You see , but you do n't see . How many mortal years did you live ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the sum total of the passion I feel for my son . I have loved him as I have never loved any other being in creation . In my loneliness , my son is everything to Inc . I low is it you ca n't interpret what you see ? " " It 's you who fail to interpret , " he answered in the same soft manner . " If you had ever felt real longing for any other one , you would know that what you feel for your son is nothing at all . " " This is futile , " I said , " to talk like this . " " No , " she said to him without the slightest wavering . " My son and I are kin to each other in more ways than one . In fifty years of life , I 've never known anyone as strong as myself , except my son . And what divides us we can always mend . But how are we to make you one of us when you use these things like wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it of yourself that you can give that we should want you ? " " My guidance is what you need , " he answered . " You 've only begun your adventure and you have no beliefs to hold you . You can not live without some guidance ... " " Millions live without belief or guidance . It is you who can not live without it , " she said . Pain coming from him . Suffering . But she went on , her voice so steady and without expression it was almost a monologue : " I have my questions , " she asked . " There are things I must know . I can not live without some embracing philosophy , but it has nothing to do with old beliefs in gods or devils . " She started pacing again , glancing to him as she spoke . " I want to know , for example , why beauty exists , " she said , " why nature continues to contrive it , and what is the link between the life of a tree and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea or a lightning storm with the feelings these things inspire in us ? If God does not exist , if these things are not unified into one metaphorical system , then why do they retain for us such symbolic power ? Lestat calls it the Savage Garden , but for me that is not enough . And I must confess that this , this maniacal curiosity or call it what you will , leads me away from my human victims . It leads me into the open countryside , away from human creation.  |p253And  maybe it will lead me away from my son , who is under the spell of all things human . " She came up to him , nothing in her manner suggesting a woman now , and she narrowed her eyes as she looked into his face . " But that is the lantern by which I see the Devil 's Road , " she said . " By what lantern have you traveled it ? What have you really learned besides devil worship and superstition ? What do you know about us , and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it might be worth something . And then again , it might be worth nothing . " He was speechless . He had no art to hide his amazement . He stared at her in innocent confusion . Then he rose and he slipped away , obviously trying to escape her , a battered spirit as he stared blankly before him . The silence closed in . And I felt for the moment strangely protective for him . She had spoken the unadorned truth about the things that interestedher as had been her custom ever since I could remember , and as always , there was something violently disregarding about it . She spoke of what mattered to her with no thought of what had befallen him . Come to a different plane , she had said , my plane . And he was stymied and belittled . The degree of his helplessness was becoming alarming . He was not recovering from her attack . He turned and he moved towards the benches again , as if he would sit , then towards the sarcophagi , then towards the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his will confronted them first in an invisible field and he was buffeted about . He drifted out of the room and into the narrow stone stairwell and then he turned and came back . His thoughts were locked inside himself or , worse , there were no thoughts ! There were only the tumbling images of what he saw before him , simple material things glaring back at him , the iron-studded door , the candles , the fire . Some full-blown evocation of the Paris streets , the vendors and the hawkers of papers , the cabriolets , the blended sound of an orchestra , a horrid din of words and phrases from the books he had so recently read . I could n't bear this , but Gabrielle gestured sternly that I should stay where I was . Something was building in the crypt . Something was happening in the very air itself . Something changed even as the candles melted , and the fire crackled and licked at the blackened stones behind it , and the rats moved in the chambers of the dead below.  |p254Armand  stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed though they had n't and Gabrielle was a long distance away in the corner of the room , her face cool in its concentration , her eyes as radiant as they were small . Armand was going to speak to us , but it was no explanation he was going to give . There was no direction even to the things he would say , and it was as if we 'd cut him open and the images were coming out like blood . Armand was just a young boy in the doorway , holding the backs of his own arms . And I knew what I felt . It was a monstrous intimacy with another being , an intimacy that made even the rapt moments of the kill seem dim and under control . 1 le was opened and could no longer contain the dazzling stream of pictures that made his old silent voice seem thin and lyrical and made up . Had this been the danger all along , the trigger of my fear ? Even as I recognized it , I was yielding , and it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the renunciation of fear . Fear was once again breaking the shell around me so that something else could spring to life . Never , never in all my existence , not mortal or immortal , had I been threatened with an intimacy quite like this . THE chamber had faded . The walls were gone . Horsemen came . A gathering cloud on the horizon . Then screams of terror . And an auburn-haired child in crude peasant 's clothes running on and on , as the horsemen broke loose in a horde and the child fighting and kicking as he was caught and thrown over the saddle of a rider who bore him away beyond the end of the world . Armand was this child . And these were the southern steppes of Russia , but Armand did n't know that it was Russia . He knew Mother and Father and Church and God and Satan , but he did n't even understand the name of home , or the name of his language , or that the horsemen who carried him away were Tatars and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Darkness , the tumultuous movement of the ship and its never endingp255sickness , and emerging out of the fear and the numbing despair , the vast glittering wilderness of impossible buildings that was Constantinople in the last days of the Byzantine Empire , with her fantastical multitudes and her slave-auction blocks . The menacing babble of foreign tongues , threats made in the universal language of gesture , and all around him the enemies he could not distinguish or placate or escape . Years and years would pass , beyond a mortal lifetime , before Armand would look back on that awesome moment and give them names and histories , the Byzantine officials of the court who would have castrated him and the harem keepers of Islam who would have done the same , and the proud Mameluke warriors of Egypt who would have taken him to Cairo with them had he been fairer and stronger , and the radiant soft-spoken ' Venetians in their leggings and velvet doublets , the most dazzling creatures of all , Christians even as he was a Christian , yet laughing gently to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unable to answer , to plead , even to hope . I saw the seas before him , the great rolling blue of the Aegean and theAdriatic , and his sickness again in the hold and his solemn vow not to live . And then the great Moorish palaces of Venice rising from the gleamingsurface of the lagoon , and the house to which he was taken , with its dozens and dozens of secret chambers , the light of the sky glimpsed only through barred windows , and the other boys speaking to him in that soft strange tongue that was Venetian and the threats and the cajoling as he was convinced , against all his fear and superstitions , of the sins that he must commit with the endless procession of strangers in this landscape of marble and torchlight , each chamber opening to a new tableau of tenderness that surrendered to the same ritual and inexplicable and finally cruel desire . And at last one night when , for days and days he had refused to submit and he was hungry and sore and would not speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those doors again , just as he was , soiled and blind from the dark room in which he 'd been locked , and the creature standing there to receive him , the tall one in red velvet , with the lean and almost luminous face , touched him so gently with cool fingers that , half dreaming , he did n't cry as he saw the coins exchange hands . But it was a great deal of money . Too much money . He was being sold off . And the face , it was too smooth , it might have been a mask . At the final moment , he screamed . He swore he would obey , he would n't fight anymore . Will someone tell him where he 's being taken , he wo n't disobey anymore , please , please . But even as he was pulled down the stairs towards the dank smell of the water , he felt the firm , delicate fingers of his new Master again , and on his neck cool and tender lips that could never , never hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and love and love in the vampire kiss . It bathed Armand , cleansed him , this is everything , as he was carried into the gondola and the gondola moved like a great sinister beetle through the narrow stream into the sewers beneath another house . Drunk on pleasure . Drunk on the silky white hands that smoothed back his hair and the voice that called him beautiful ; on the face that in moments of feeling was suffused with expression only to become as serene and dazzling as something made of jewels and alabaster in repose . Like a pool of moonlit water it was . " Touch it even with the fingertip and all its life rises to the surface only to vanish in quiet once again . Drunk in the morning light on the memory of those kisses as , alone , he opened one door after another upon books and maps and statues in granite and marble , the other apprentices finding him and leading him patiently to his work  --  letting hint watch as they ground the brilliant pigments , teaching him to blend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spread the lacquer of the egg yolk over the panels , and taking him up on the scaffolding as they worked with careful strokes on the very edges of the vast depiction of sun and clouds , showing him those great faces and hands and angels ' wings which only the Master 's brush would touch . Drunk as he sat at the long table with them , gorging himself on the delicious foods that he had never tasted before , and the wine which never ran out . And falling asleep finally to wake at that moment of twilight when the Master stood beside the enormous bed , gorgeous as something imagined in his red velvet , with his thick white hair glistening in the lamplight , and the simplest happiness in his brilliant cobalt blue eyes . The deadly kiss . " Ah , yes , never to be separated from you , yes , . . . not afraid . " " Soon , my darling one , we will be truly united soon . " Torches blazing throughout the house . The Master atop the scaffoldingwith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the light , do n't move , " and hours and hours frozen in the same position , and then before dawn , seeing his own likeness there in the paint , the face of the angel , the Master smiling as he moved down the endless corridor .. . " No , Master , do n't leave me , let me stay with you , do n't go ... " Day again , and money in his pockets , real gold , and the grandeur of Venice with her dark green waterways walled in palaces , and the other apprentices walking arm in arm with him , and the fresh air and the blue sky over the Piazza San Marco like something he had only dreamed in childhood , and the palazzo again at twilight , and the Master coming , the Master bent over the smaller panel with the brush , working faster and faster as the apprentices gazed on half horrified , half fascinated , the Master look/tug up and seeing him and putting down the brush , and taking him out of the enormous studio as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face in the Master 's hands as , alone in the bedchamber again , that secret , never tell anyone , kiss . Two years ? Three years ? No words to recreate it or embrace it , the glory that was those times  --  the fleets that sailed away to war from that port , the hymns that rose before those Byzantine altars , the passion plays and the miracle plays performed on their platforms in the churches and in the piazza with their hell 's mouth and cavorting devils , and the glittering mosaics spreading out over the walls of San Marco and San Zanipolo and the Palazzo Ducale , and the painters who walked those streets , Giambono , l ' ccello , the Vivarini and the Bellini ; and the endless feast days and processions , and always in the small hours in the vast torchlighted rooms of the palazzo , alone with the Master when the others slept safely locked away . I'lie Master 's brush racing over the panel before it as if uncovering the painting rather than creating it  --  sun and sky and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings . And those awful inevitable moments when the Master would rise screaming , hurling the pots of paint in all directions , clutching at his eyes as if he would pull them out of his head . " Why can I not see ? Why can I not see better than mortals see ? " Holding tight to the Master . Waiting for the rapture of the kiss . Dark secret , unspoken secret . The Master slipping out of the door sometime before dawn . " Let me go with you , Master . " " Soon , my darling , my love , my little one , when you 're strong enough and tall enough , and there is no flaw in you anymore . Go now , and have all the pleasures that await you , have the love of a woman , and have the love of a man as well in the nights that follow . Forget the bitterness you knew in the brothel and taste of these things while there is still time . " And rarely did the night close that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising sun , and this time ruddy and warm as it bent over him to give him the embrace that would sustain him through the daylight hours until the deadly kiss at twilight again . He learned to read and to write . He took the paintings to their final destinations in the churches and the chapels of the great palaces , and collected the payments and bargained for the pigments and the oils . He scolded the servants when the beds were n't made and the meals were n't ready . And beloved by the apprentices , he sent them to their new service when they were finished , with tears . He read poetry to the Master as the Master painted , and he learned to play the lute and to sing songs.  |p258And  during those sad times when the Master left Venice for many nights , it was he who governed in the Master 's absence , concealing his anguish from the others , knowing it would end only when the Master returned . And one night finally , in the small hours when even Venice slept : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to me and become like me . Is it what you wish ? " " Yes . " " Forever to thrive in secret upon the blood of the evildoer as I thrive , and to abide with these secrets until the end of the world . " " I take the vow , I surrender , I will . . . to be with you , my Master , always , you are the creator of all things that I am . There has never been any greater desire . " The Master 's brush pointing to the painting that reached to the ceiling above the tiers of scaffolding . " This is the only sun that you will ever see again . But a millennium of nights will be yours to see light as no mortal has ever seen it , to snatch from the distant stars as if you were Prometheus an endless illumination by which to understand all things . " How many months were there after ? Reeling in the power of the Dark Gift . This nighttime life of drifting through the alleyways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dark and no longer afraid of it  --  and the age-old rapture of the killing , and never , never the innocent souls . No , always the evildoer , the mind pierced until Typhon , the slayer of his brother , was revealed , and then the drinking up of the evil from the mortal victim and the transmuting of it into ecstasy , the Master leading the way , the feast shared . And the painting afterwards , the solitary hours with the miracle of the new skill , the brush sometimes moving as if by itself across the enameled surface , and the two of them painting furiously on the triptych , and the mortal apprentices asleep among the paint pots and the wine bottles , and only one mystery disturbing the serenity , the mystery that the Master , as in the past , must now and then leave Venice for a journey that seemed endless to those left behind . All the more terrible now the parting . To hunt alone without the Master , to lie alone in the deep cellar after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Master 's laughter or the beat of the Master 's heart . " But where do you go ? Why ca n't I go with you ? " Armand pleaded . Did n't they share the secret ? Why was this mystery not explained ? " No , my lovely one , you are not ready for this burden . For now , it must be , as it has been for over a thousand years , mine alone . Someday youp259will help me with what I have to do , but only when you are ready for the knowledge , when you have shown that you truly wish to know , and when you are powerful enough that no one can ever take the knowledge from you against your will . Until then understand I have no choice but to leave you . I go to tend to Those Who Must Be Kept as I have always done . " Those Who Must Be Kept . Armand brooded upon it ; it frightened him . But worst of all it took the Master from him , and only did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him again and again . " Those Who Must Be Kept are in peace , or in silence , " he would say as he took the red velvet cloak from his shoulders . " More than that we may never know . " And to the feast again , the stalking of the evildoer through the alleys of Venice , he and the Master would go . How long might it have continued  --  through one mortal lifetime ? Through a hundred ? Not a half year in this dark bliss before the evening at twilight when the Master stood over his coffin in the deep cellar just above the water , and said : " Rise , Armand , we must leave here . They have come ! " " But who are they , Master ? Is it Those Who Must Be Kept ? " " No , my darling . It is the others . Come , we must hurry ! " " But how can they hurt us ? Why must we go ? " The white faces at the windows , the pounding at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way and that as he looked at the paintings . The smell of smoke . The smell of burning pitch . They were coming up from the cellar . They were coming down from above . " Run , there is no time to save anything . " Up the stairs to the roof . Black hooded figures heaving their torches through the doorways , the fire roaring in the rooms below , exploding the windows , boiling up the stairway . All the paintings were burning . " To the roof , Armand . Come ! " Creatures like ourselves in these dark garments ! Others like ourselves . Hie Master scattered them in all directions as he raced up the stairway , bones cracking as they struck the ceiling and the walls . " Blasphemer , heretic ! " the alien voices roared . The arms caught Armandand held him , and above at the very top of the stairway the Master turned back for him : " Armand ! Trust your strength . Come ! " But they were swarming behind the Master . They were surrounding him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more appeared , until fiftyp260torches were plunged into the Master 's velvet garments , his long red sleeves , his white hair . The fire roared up to the ceiling as it consumed him , making of him a living torch , even as with flaming arms he defended himself , igniting his attackers as they threw the blazing torches like firewoodat his feet . But Armand was being borne down and away , out of the burning house , with the screaming mortal apprentices . And over the water and away from Venice , amid cries and wailing , in the belly of a vessel as terrifying as the slave ship , to an open clearing under the night sky . " Blasphemer , blasphemer ! " The bonfire growing , and the chain of hooded figures around it , and the chant rising and rising , " Into the fire . " " No , do n't do it to me , no ! " And as he watched , petrified , he saw brought towards the pyre the mortal apprentices , his brothers , his only brothers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the flames . " No . . . stop this , they 're innocent ! For the love of God , stop , innocent ! . . . " He was screaming , but now his time had come . They were liftinghim as he struggled , and he was flung up and up to fall down into the blast . " Master , help me ! " Then all words giving way to one wailing cry . Thrashing , screaming , mad . But he had been taken out of it . Snatched back into life . And he lay on the ground looking at the sky . The flames licked the stars , it seemed , but he was far away from them , and could n't even feel the heat anymore . He could smell his burnt clothing and his burnt hair . The pain in his face and hands was the worst and the blood was leaking out of him and he could scarcely move his lips .. . " ... All thy Master 's vain works destroyed , all the vain creations which he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saints and living mortals ! Wilt thou , too , be destroyed ? Or serve Satan ? Make thy choice . Thou bast tasted the fire , and the fire waits for thee , hungry for thee . Hell waits for thee . Wilt thou make thy choice ? " . . . yes ... " ... to serve Satan as he is meant to be served . " " Yes ... " " ... That all things of the world are vanity , and thou shalt never use thy Dark Powers for any mortal vanity , not to paint , not to create music , not to dance , nor to recite for the amusement of mortals but only and forever in the service of Satan , thy Dark Powers to seduce and to terrify and to destroy , only to destroy ... " " Yes ... " " ... consecrated to thy one and only master , Satan , Satan forever ,  |p261always  and forever . . . to serve thy true master in darkness and pain and in suffering , to surrender thy mind and thy heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from thy brethren in Satan no secret , to yield all knowledgeof the blasphemer and his burden ... " Silence . " To yield all knowledge of the burden , child ! Come now , the flames wait . " " I do not understand you ... " " Those Who Must Be Kept . Tell . " " Tell what ? I do not know anything , except that I do not wish to suffer . I am so afraid . " " The truth , Child of Darkness . Where are they ? Where are Those Who Must Be Kept ? " " I do not know . Look into my mind if you have that same power . ' I'here is nothing I can tell . " " But what , child , what are they ? Did he never tell you ? What are ' Those Who Must Be Kept ? " And so they did not understand it either . It was no more than a phrase to them as it was to him . When you are powerful enough that no one can ever take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been wise . " What is its meaning ! Where are they ? We must have the answer . " " I swear to you , I do not have it . I swear on my fear which is all I possess now , I do not know ! " White faces appearing above him , one at a time . The tasteless lips giving hard , sweet kisses , hands stroking him , and from their wrists the glittering droplets of blood . They wanted the truth to come out in the blood . But what did it matter ? The blood was the blood . " Thou art the devil 's child now . " " Yes . " " Do n't weep for thy master , Marius . Marius is in hell where he belongs . Now drink the healing blood and rise and dance with thine own kind for the glory of Satan ! And immortality will be truly thine ! ' " Yes "  --  the blood burning his tongue as he lifted his head , the blood filling him with torturous slowness . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the low beat of drums . They were satisfied . They knew he had spoken the truth . They would not kill him and the ecstasy dimmed all considerations . The pain in his hands and his face had melted into this ecstasy " Rise , young one , and join the Children of Darkness . " " Yes , I do . " White hands reaching for his hands . Horns and lutesp262shrilling over the thud of the drums , the harps plucked into an hypnotic strumming as the circle commenced to move . Hooded figures in mendicant black , robes flowing as they lifted their knees high and bent their backs . And breaking hands , they whirled , leapt , and came down again , spinninground and round , and a humming song rose louder and louder from their closed lips . The circle swept on faster . The humming was a great melancholy vibration without shape or continuity and yet it seemed to be a form of speaking , to be the very echo of thought . Louder and louder it came like a moan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the same sound with it , and then turning , and dizzy with turning , he leapt high into the air . Hands caught him , lips kissed him , he was whirling about and pulled along by the others , someone crying out in Latin , another answering , another crying louder , and another answer coming again . He was flying , no longer bound to the earth and the awful pain of his Master 's death , and the death of the paintings , and death of the mortals he loved . The wind sailed past him , and the heat blasted his face and eyes . But the singing was so beautiful that it did n't matter that he did n't know the words , or that he could n't pray to Satan , did n't know how to believe or make such a prayer . No one knew that he did n't know and they were all in a chorus together and they cried and lamented and turned and leapt again and then , swaying back and forth , threw their heads back as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , YES ! " And the music surged . A barbarous rhythm broke loose all around him from drums and tambourines , voices in lurid rushing melody at last . The vampires threw up their arms , howled , figures flickering past him in riotous contortions , backs arched , heels stomping . The jubilation of imps in hell . It horrified him and it called to him , and when the hands clutched at him and swung him around , he stomped and twisted and danced like the others , letting the pain course through him , bending his limbs and giving the alarm to his cries . And before dawn , he was delirious , and he had a dozen brothers around him , caressing him and soothing him , and leading him down a staircase that had opened in the bowels of the earth . IT SEEMED that some time in the months that followed Armand dreamed his Master had not been burnt to death . He dreamed his Master had fallen from the roof , a blazing comet , into the saving waters of the canal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his Master survived . His Master called to him to come . His Master was in the sanctuary of Those Who Must Be Kept . Sometimes in the dream his Master was as powerful and radiant as he had ever been ; beauty seemed his raiment . And at others he was burnt black and shriveled , a breathing cinder , his eyes huge and yellow , and only his white hair as lustrous and full as it had been . He crept along the ground in his weakness , pleading for Armand to help him . And behind him , warm light spilled from the sanctuary of Those Who Must Be Kept ; there came i he smell of incense , and there seemed some promise of ancient magic there , some promise of cold and exotic beauty beyond all evil and all good . But these were vain imaginings . His Master had told him that fire and the light of the sun could destroy them , and he himself had seen his Master in flames . It was like wishing for his mortal life to come again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open on the moon and the stars , and the still mirror of the sea before him , he knew no hope , and no grief , and no joy . All those things had come from the Master , and the Master was no more . " I am the devil 's child . " That was poetry . All will was extinguished in him , and there was nothing but the dark confraternity , and the kill was now of the innocent as well as the guilty . The kill was above all cruel . In Rome in the great coven in the catacombs , he bowed before Santino , the leader , who came down the stone steps to receive him with outstretched arms . This great one had been Born to Darkness in the time of the Black Death , and he told Armand of the vision that had come to him in the year 1 ; 49 when the plague raged , that we were to be as the Black Death itself , a vexation without explanation , to cause man to doubt the mercy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skulls Santino took Armand , telling him of the history of the vampires . From all times we have existed , as wolves have , a scourge of mortals . And in the coven of Rome , dark shadow of the Roman Church , lay our final perfection . Armand already knew the rituals and common prohibitions ; now he must learn the great laws : One  --  that each coven must have its leader and only he might order the working of the Dark Trick upon a mortal , seeing that the methods and the rituals were properly observed . Two  --  that the Dark Gifts must never be given to the crippled , the maimed , or to children , or to those who can not , even with the Dark Powers , survive on their own . Be it further understood that all mortals whop264would receive the Dark Gifts should be beautiful in person so that the insult to God might be greater when the Dark Trick is done . Three  --  that never should an old vampire work this magic lest the blood of the fledgling be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , and the old ones have too much strength to pass on . Injury , burning  --  these catastrophes , if they do not destroy the Child of Satan will only increase his powers when he is healed . Yet Satan guards the flock from the power of old ones , for almost all , without exception , go mad . In this particular , let Armand observe that there was no vampire then living who was more than three hundred years old . No one alive then could remember the first Roman coven . The devil frequently calls his vampires home . But let Armand understand here also that the effect of the Dark Trick is unpredictable , even when passed on by the very young vampire and with all due care . For reasons no one knows , some mortals when Born to Darknessbecome as powerful as Titans , others may be no more than corpses that move . That is why mortals must be chosen with skill . Those with great passion and indomitable will should be avoided as well as those who have none . Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except that the coven master has the power of life and death over all of his flock . And it is , further , his obligation to lead the old ones and the mad ones into the fire when they can longer serve Satan as they should . It is his obligation to destroy all vampires who are not properly made . It is his obligation to destroy those who are so badly wounded that they can not survive on their own . And it is his obligation finally to seek the destruction of all outcasts and all who have broken these laws . Five  --  that no vampire shall ever reveal his true nature to a mortal and allow that mortal to live . No vampire must ever reveal the history of the vampires to a mortal and let the mortal live . No vampire must commit to writing the history of the vampires or any true knowledge of vampires lest such a history be found by mortals and believed . And a vampire 's name must never be known to mortals , save from his tombstone , and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any other vampire 's lair . These then were the great commandments , which all vampires must obey . And this was the condition of existence among all the Undead . Yet Armand should know that there had always been stories of ancient ones , heretic vampires of frightening power who submitted to no authority , not even that of the devil  --  vampires who had survived for thousands of years . Children of the Millennia , they were sometimes called . In the north of Europe there were tales of Mael , who dwelt in the forests of Englandp265and Scotland ; and in Asia Minor the legend of Pandora . And in Egypt , the ancient tale of the vampire Ramses , seen again in this very time . In all parts of the world one found such tales . And one could easily dismiss them as fanciful save for one thing . The ancient heretic Marius had been found in Venice , and there punished by the Children of Darkness . I ' he legend of Marius had been true . But Marius was no more . Armand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell Santino of the dreams he had had . In truth the dreams had dimmed inside Armand as had the colors of Marius 's paintings . They were no longer held in Armand 's mind or heart to be discovered by others who might try to see . When Santino spoke of Those Who Must Be Kept , Armand again confessed that he did not know the meaning of it . Neither did Santino , nor my vampire that Santino had ever known . Dead was the secret . Dead was Marius . And so consign to silence the old and useless mystery . Satan is our Lord and Master . In Satan , all is understood and all is known . Armand pleased Santino . He memorized the laws , perfected his performance of the ceremonial incantations , the rituals , and the prayers . He saw the greatest Sabbats he was ever to witness . And he learned from the most powerful and skillful and beautiful vampires he was ever to know . He learned so well that he became a missionary sent out to gather the vagrant Children of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of t he Sabbat , and the working of the Dark Trick when the world and the flesh and the devil called for it to be done . In Spain and in Germany and in France , he had taught the Dark Blessings and Dark Rituals , and he had known savage and tenacious Childrenof Darkness , and dim flames had flared in him in their company and in those moments when the coven surrounded him , comforted by him , deriving its unity from his strength . He had perfected the act of killing beyond the abilities of all the Children of Darkness that he knew . He had learned to summon those who truly wished to die . He had but to stand near the dwellings of mortals and call silently to see his victim appear . Old , young , wretched , diseased , the ugly or the beautiful , it did not matter because he did not choose . Dazzling visions he gave , if they should want to receive , but he did not move towards them nor even close his arms around them . Drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And when their warm living flesh touched him , when he opened his lips and felt the blood spill , he knew the only surcease from misery that he could know . It seemed to him in the best of these moments that his way wasp266profoundly spiritual , uncontaminated by the appetites and confusions that made up the world , despite the carnal rapture of the kill . In that act the spiritual and the carnal came together , and it was the spiritual , he was convinced , that survived . Holy Communion it seemed to him , the Blood of the Children of Christ serving only to bring the essence of life itself into his understanding for the split second in which death occurred . Only the great saints of God were his equals in this spirituality , this confrontation with mystery , this existence of meditation and denial . Yet he had seen the greatest of his companions vanish , bring destructionupon themselves , go mad . 1 le had witnessed the inevitable dissolution of covens , seen immortality defeat the most perfectly made Children of Darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it never defeated him . Was he destined to be one of the ancient ones ? The Children of the Millennia ? Could one believe those stories which persisted still ? Now and then a roaming vampire would speak of the fabled Pandora glimpsed in the far-off Russian city of Moscow , or of Mael living on the bleak English coast . The wanderers told even of Marius  --  that he had been seen again in Egypt , or in Greece . But these storytellers had not themselves laid eyes upon the legendary ones . They knew nothing really . These were often-repeated tales . They did not distract or amuse the obedient servant of Satan . In quiet allegiance to the Dark Ways , Armand continued to serve . Yet in the centuries of his long obedience , Armand kept two secrets to himself . These were his property , these secrets , more purely his than the coffin in which he locked himself by day , or the few amulets he wore . The first was that no matter how great his loneliness , or how long the search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort , he never worked the Dark Trick himself . He would n't give that to Satan , no Child of Darkness made by him . And the other secret , which he kept from his followers for their sake , was simply the extent of his ever deepening despair . That he craved nothing , cherished nothing , believed nothing finally , and took not one particle of pleasure in his ever increasing and awesome powers , and existed from moment to moment in a void broken once ever night of his eternal life by the kill  --  that secret he had kept from them as long as they had needed him and it had been possible to lead them because his fear would have made them afraid . But it was finished . A great cycle had ended , and even years ago he had felt it closing without understanding it was a cycle at all . From Rome there came the garbled travelers ' accounts , old when thep267were told to him , that the leader , Santino , had abandoned his flock . Some said he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leapt into the fire , others that " the world " had swallowed him , that he had been borne off in a black coach with mortals never to be seen again . " We go into the fire or we go into legend , " said a teller of the talc . Then came accounts of chaos in Rome , of dozens of leaders who put on the black hood and the black robes to preside over the coven . And then it seemed there were none . Since the year 1700 there had been no word anymore from Italy . For half a century Armand had not been able to trust to his passion or that of the others around him to create the frenzy of the true Sabbat . And he had dreamed of his old Master , Marius , in those rich robes of red velvet , and seen the palazzo full of vibrant paintings , and he had been afraid . Then another had come . His children rushed down into the cellars beneath les Innocents to describe to him this new vampire , who wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches and strike down those who wore crosses and walk in the places of light . Red velvet . It was mere coincidence , and yet it maddened him and seemed an insult to him , a gratuitous pain that his soul could n't bear . And then the woman had been made , the woman with the hair of a lion and the name of an angel , beautiful and powerful as her son . And he had come up the stairway out of the catacomb , leading the band against us , as the hooded ones had come to destroy him and his Master in Venice centuries before . And it had failed . He stood dressed in these strange lace and brocade garments . He carried coins in his pockets . His mind swam with images from the thousands of books he had read . And he felt himself pierced with all he had witnessed in the places of light in the great city called Paris , and it was as if he could hear his old Master whispering in his ear : But a millennium of nights will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen it , to snatch from the distant stars as if you were Prometheus an endless illumination by which to understand all things . " All things have eluded my understanding , " he said . " I am as one whom the earth has given back , and you , Lestat and Gabrielle , are like the images painted by my old Master in cerulean and carmine and gold . " He stood still in the doorway , his hands on the backs of his arms , and he was looking at us , asking silently : What is there to know ? What is there to give ? We are the abandoned of God . And there is no Devil 's Road spinning out before me and there are no bells of hell ringing in my ears.  |p268AN  HOUR passed . Perhaps more . Armand sat by the fire . No marks A any longer on his face from the long-forgotten battle . He seemed , in his stillness , to be as fragile as an emptied shell . Gabrielle sat across from him , and she too stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemingly compassionate . It was painful for me not to know her thoughts . I was thinking of Marius . And Marius and Marius . . . the vampire who had painted pictures in and of the real world . Triptychs , portraits , frescoes on the walls of his palazzo . And the real world had never suspected him nor hunted him nor cast him out . It was this band of hooded fiends who came to burn the paintings , the ones who shared the Dark Gift with him  --  had he himself ever called it the Dark Gift ?  --  they were the ones who said he could n't live and create among mortals . Not mortals . I saw the little stage at Renaud 's and I heard myself sing and the singing become a roar . Nicolas said , " It is splendid . " I said , " It is petty . " And it was like striking Nicolas . In my imagination he said what he had not said that night : " Let me have what I can believe in . You would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in churches and convent chapels , maybe on the walls of the great houses in Venice and Padua . The vampires would not have gone into holy places to pull them down . So they were there somewhere , with a signature perhaps worked into the detail , these creations of the vampire who surrounded himself with mortal apprentices , kept a mortal lover from whom he took the little drink , went out alone to kill . I thought of the night in the inn when I had seen the meaninglessness of life , and the soft fathomless despair of Armand 's story seemed an ocean in which I might drown . This was worse than the blasted shore in Nicki 's mind . This was for three centuries , this darkness , this nothingness . The radiant auburn-haired child by the fire could open his mouth again and out would come blackness like ink to cover the world . That is , if there had not been this protagonist , this Venetian master , who had committed the heretical act of making meaning on the panels he painted  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the elect of Satan , had made him into a living torch . Had Gabrielle seen these paintings in the story as I had seen them ? Did they burn in her mind 's eye as they did in mine ?  |p269Marius  was traveling some route into my soul that would let him roam there forever , along with the hooded fiends who turned the paintings into chaos again . In a dull sort of misery , I thought of the travelers ' tales  --  that Marius was alive , seen in Egypt or Greece . I wanted to ask Armand , was n't it possible ? Marius must have been so very strong . . . But it seemed disrespectful of him to ask . " Old legend , " he whispered . His voice was as precise as the inner voice . Unhurriedly , he continued without ever looking away from the flames . " Legend from the olden times before they destroyed us both . " " Perhaps not , " I said . Echo of the visions , paintings on the walls . " Maybe Marius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said quietly , " depending upon how you wish to see us . And when you first know about us , whether it 's through the dark blood or promises or visitations , you think anything is possible . But that is n't so . The world closes tight around this miracle soon enough ; and you do n't hope for other miracles . That is , you become accustomed to the new limits and the limits define everything once again . So they say Marius continues . They all continue somewhere , that 's what you want to believe . " Not a single one remains in the coven in Rome from those nights when I was taught the ritual ; and maybe the coven itself is no longer even there . Years and years have passed since there was any communication from the coven . But they all exist somewhere , do n't they ? After all , we ca n't die . " He sighed . " Does n't matter , " he said . Something greater and more terrible mattered , that this despair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thirst in him now , the blood lost when we had fought together , and the silent furnace of his body healing the bruises and the broken flesh , he could not will himself into the world above to hunt . Rather suffer the thirst and the heat of the silent furnace . Rather stay here and be with us . But he already knew the answer , that he could not be with us . Gabrielle and I did n't have to speak to let him know . We did not even have to resolve the question in our minds . He knew , the way God might know the future because God is the possessor of all the facts . Unbearable anguish . And Gabrielle 's expression all the more weary , sad . " You know that with all my soul I do want to take you with us , " I said . I was surprised at my own emotion . " But it would be disaster for us all . No change in him . He knew . No challenge from Gabrielle . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p270I  know . And you do not think of Those Who Must Be Kept , which is most strange . " That is merely another mystery , " I said . " And there are a thousand mysteries . I think of Marius ! And I 'm too much the slave of my own obsessions and fascination . It 's a dreadful thing to linger so on Marius , to extract that one radiant figure from the tale . " Does n't matter . If it pleases you , take it . I do not lose what I give . " When a being reveals his pain in such a torrent , you are bound to respect the whole of the tragedy . You have to try to comprehend . And such helplessness , such despair is almost incomprehensible to me . That 's why I think of Marius . Marius I understand . You I do n't understand . " Why ? Silence . Did n't he deserve the truth ? " I 've been a rebel always , " I said . " You 've been the slave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leader of my coven ! " " No . You were the slave of Marius and then of the Children of Darkness . You fell under the spell of one and then the other . What you suffer now is the absence of a spell . I think I shudder that you caused me so to understand it for a little while , to know it as if I were a different being than I am . " " Does n't matter , " he said , eyes still on the fire . " You think too much in terms of decision and action . This tale is no explanation . And I am not a being who requires a respectful acknowledgment in your thoughts or in words . And we all know the answer you have given is too immense to be voiced and we all three of us know that it is final . What I do n't know is why . So I am a creature very different from you , and so you can not , understand me . Why ca n't I go with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with you . I will be under your spell . " I thought of Marius with his brush and the pots of egg tempera . " How could you have ever believed anything that they told you after they burned those paintings ? " I asked . " How could you have given yourself over to them ? " Agitation , rising anger . Caution in Gabrielle 's face , but not fear . " And you , when you stood on the stage and you saw the audience screaming to get out of the theater  --  how my followers described this to me , the vampire terrifying the crowd and the crowd streaming into the boulevarddu Temple  --  what did you believe ? That you did not belong among mortals , that 's what you believed . You knew you did not . And there wasp271no band of fiends in hooded robes to tell you . You knew . So Marius did not belong among mortals . So 1 did not . " " Ah , but it 's different . " " No , it is not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is now at this very moment working out its little dramas to bring in the gold from the boulevard crowds . You do not wish to deceive as N'larius deceived . It divides you ever more from mankind . You want to pretend to be mortal , but to deceive makes you angry and it makes you kill . " " In that moment on the stage , " I said , " I revealed myself . I did the very opposite of deceiving . I wanted somehow in making manifest the monstrosityof myself to be joined with my fellow humans again . Better they should run from me than not see me . Better they should know I was something monstrous than for me to glide through the world unrecognized by those upon whom I preyed . " " But it was not better . " " No . What Marius did was better . He did not deceive . " " Of course he did . He fooled everyone ! " " No . He found a way to imitate mortal life . To be one with mortals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as mortals paint . Angels and blue skies , clouds , those are the things you made me see when you were telling . He created good things . And I see wisdom in him and a lack of vanity . He did not need to reveal himself . He had lived a thousand years and he believed more in the vistas of heaven that he painted than in himself . " Confusion . Does n't matter now , devils who paint angels . " Those are only metaphors , " I said . " And it does matter ! If you are to rebuild , if you are to find the Devil 's Road again , it does matter ! There are ways for us to exist . If I could only imitate life , just find a way ... " " You say things that mean nothing to me . We are the abandoned of God . " Gabrielle glanced at him suddenly . " Do you believe in God ? " she asked . " Yes , always in God , " he answered . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is the fiction which has betrayed me . " " Oh , then you are truly damned , " I said . " And you know full well that your retreat into the fraternity of the Children of Darkness was a retreat from a sin that was not a sin . " Anger . " Your heart breaks for something you 'll never have , " he countered , his voice rising suddenly . " You brought Gabrielle and Nicolas over the barrier to you , but you could not go back . "  | " Why is it you do n't hearken to your own story ? " I asked . " Is it that you have never forgiven Marius for not warning you about them , letting you fall into their hands ? You will never take anything , not example or inspiration , from Marius again ? I am not Marius , but I tell you since I set my feet on the Devil 's Road , I have heard of only one elder who could teach me anything , and that is Marius , your Venetian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is saying something to me of a way to be immortal . " " Mockery . " " No . It was n't mockery ! And you are the one whose heart breaks for what he will never have : another body of belief , another spell . " No answer . " We can not be Marius for you , " I said , " or the dark lord , Santino . We are not artists with a great vision that will carry you forward . And we are not evil coven masters with the conviction to condemn a legion to perdition . And this domination  --  this glorious mandate  --  is what you must have . " I had risen to my feet without meaning to . I had come close to the fireplace and I was looking down at him . And I saw , out of the corner of my eye , Gabrielle 's subtle nod of approval , and the way that she closed her eyes for a moment as if she were allowing herself a sigh of relief . He was perfectly still . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " and find what impels you to continue . If you come with us we will fail you and you will destroy us . " " How suffer through it ? " He looked up at me and his eyebrows came together in the most poignant frown . " How do I begin ? You move like the right hand of God ! But for me the world , the real world in which Marius lived , is beyond reach . I never lived in it . I push against the glass . But how do I get in ? " " I ca n't tell you that , " I said . " You have to study this age , " Gabrielle interrupted . Her voice was calm but commanding . He looked towards her as she spoke . " You have to understand the age , " she continued , " through its literature and its music and its art . You have come up out of the earth , as you yourself put it . Now live in the world . " No answer from him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor . Western civilization in heaps . " And what better place is there than the center of things , the boulevard and the theater ? " Gabrielle asked . He frowned , his head turning dismissively , but she pressed on.  | " Your gift is for leading the coven , and your coven is still there . " He made a soft despairing sound . " Nicolas is a fledgling , " she said . " He can teach them much about the world outside , but he can not really lead them . The woman , Eleni , is amazinglyclever , but she will make way for you . " " What is it to me , their games ? " he whispered . " It is a way to exist , " she said . " And that is all that matters to you now . " " The Theater of the Vampires ! I should rather the fire . " " Think of it , " she said . " There 's a perfection in it you ca n't deny . We are illusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illusion of what is real . " " It 's an abomination , " he said . " What did Lestat call it ? Petty ? " " That was to Nicolas because Nicolas would build fantastical philosophiesupon it , " she said . " You must live now without fantastical philosophies , the way you did when you were Marius 's apprentice . Live to learn the age . And Lestat does not believe in the value of evil . But you do believe in it . I know that you do . " " I am evil , " he said half smiling . He almost laughed . " It 's not a matter of belief , is it ? But do you think I could go from the spiritual path I followed for three centuries to voluptuousness and debauchery such as that ? We were the saints of evil , " he protested . " I will not be common evil . I will not . " Make it uncommon , " she said . She was getting too impatient . " If you are evil , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , the flesh , and the devil conspire equally against man ? " He shook his head , as if to say he did not care . " You are more concerned with what is spiritual than with evil , " I interjected , watching him closely . " Is that not so ? " " Yes , " he said at once . " But do n't you see , the color of wine in a crystal glass can be spiritual , " I continued . " The look in a face , the music of a violin . A Paris theater can be infused with the spiritual for all its solidity . There 's nothing in it that has n't been shaped by the power of those who possessed spiritual visions of what it could be . " Something quickened in him , but he pushed it away . " Seduce the public with voluptuousness , " Gabrielle said . " For God 's sake , and the devil 's , use the power of the theater as you will . " " Were n't the paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could feel a warming in myself now at the thought of it . " Can anyone look on the great works of that time and not call them spiritual ? " " I have asked myself that question , " Armand answered , " many times.  |p274Was  it spiritual or was it voluptuous ? Was the angel painted on the triptych caught in the material , or was the material transformed ? " " No matter what they did to you after , you never doubted the beauty and the value of his work , " I said . " I know you did n't . And it was the material transformed . It ceased to be paint and it became magic , just as in the kill the blood ceases to be blood and becomes life . " His eyes misted , but no visions came from him . Whatever road he traveled back in his thoughts , he traveled alone . " The carnal and the spiritual , " Gabrielle said , " come together in the theater as they do in the paintings . Sensual fiends we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He closed his eyes for a moment as if he would shut us out . " Go to them and listen to the music that Nicki makes , " she said . " Make art with them in the " Theater of the Vampires . You have to pass away from what failed you into what can sustain vou . Otherwise  --  there is no hope . " I wished she had not said it so abruptly , brought it so to the point . But he nodded and his lips pressed together in a bitter smile . " The only thing really important for you , " she said slowly , " is that you go to an extreme . " He stared at her blankly . He could not possibly understand what she meant by this . And I thought it too brutal a truth to say . But he did n't resist it . His face became thoughtful and smooth and childlike again . For a long time he looked at the fire . Then he spoke : " But why must you go at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war with you now . No one is trying to drive you out . Why ca n't you build it with me , this little enterprise ? " Did that mean he would do it , go to the others and become part of the theater in the boulevard ? He did n't contradict me . He was asking again why could n't I create the imitation of life , if that was what I wanted to call it , right in the boulevard ? But he was also giving up . He knew I could n't endure the sight of the theater , or the sight of Nicolas . I could n't even really urge him towards it . Gabrielle had done that . And he knew that it was too late to press us anymore . Finally Gabrielle said : " We ca n't live among our own kind , Armand . " And 1 thought , yes , that is the truest answer of all , and I do n't know why I could n't speak it aloud . " The Devil 's Road is what we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each other now . Maybe years and years into the future , when we'vep275been a thousand places and seen a thousand things , we 'll come back . We 'll talk then together as we have tonight . " This came as no real shock to him . But it was impossible now to know what he thought . For a long time we did n't speak . I do n't know how long we remained quiet together in the room . I tried not to think of Marius anymore , or of Nicolas either . All sense of danger was gone now , but I was afraid of the parting , of the sadness of it , of the feeling that I had taken from this creature his astonishing story and given him precious little for it in return . It was Gabrielle who finally broke the quiet . She rose and moved gracefully to the bench beside him . " Armand , " she said . " We are going . If I have my way we 'll be miles from Paris before midnight tomorrow night . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know now what he chose to conceal . " Even if you do not go to the theater , " she said , " accept the things that we can give you . My son has wealth enough to make an entrance into the world very easy for you . " " You can take this tower for your lair , " I said . " Use it as long as you wish . Magnus found it safe enough . " After a moment , he nodded with a grave politeness , but he did n't say anything . " Let Lestat give you the gold needed to make you a gentleman , " Gabrielle said . " And all we ask in return is that you leave the coven in peace if you do not choose to lead it . " He was looking at the fire again , face tranquil , irresistibly beautiful . Then again he nodded in silence . And the nod itself meant no more than that he had heard , not that he would promise anything . " If you will not go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hurt them . Do not hurt Nicolas . " And when I spoke these words , his face changed very subtly . It was almost a smile that crept over his features . And his eyes shifted slowly to me . And I saw the scorn in them . I looked away but the look had affected me as much as a blow . " I do n't want him to be harmed , " I said in a tense whisper . " No . You want him destroyed , " he whispered back . " So that you neednever fear or grieve for him anymore . " And the look of scorn sharpenedhideously . Gabrielle intervened . " Armand , " she said , " he is not dangerous to them . The woman alonep276can control him . And he has things to teach all of you about this time if you will listen . " They looked at each other for some time in silence . And again his face was soft and gentle and beautiful . And in a strangely decorous manner he took Gabrielle 's hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he let her hand go , and he drew a little away from her and squared his shoulders . He looked at both of us . " I 'll go to them , " he said in the softest voice . " And I will take the gold you offer me , and I will seek refuge in this tower . And I will learn from your passionate fledgling whatever he has to teach me . But I reach for these things only because they float on the surface of the darkness in which I am drowning . And I would not descend without some finer understanding . I would not leave eternity to you without . . . without some final battle . " I studied him . But no thoughts came from him to clarify these words . " Maybe as the years pass , " he said , " desire will come again to me . I will know appetite again , even passion . Maybe when we meet in another age , these things will not be abstract and fleeting . I 'll speak with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . And we will ponder matters of immortality and wisdom . We will talk about vengeance or acceptance then . For now it 's enough for me to say that I want to see you again . I want our paths to cross in the future . And for that reason alone , I will do as you ask and not what you want : I will spare your ill-fated Nicolas . " I gave an audible sigh of relief . Yet his tone was so changed , so strong , that it sounded a deep silent alarm in me . This was the coven master , surely , this quiet and forceful one , the one who would survive , no matter how the orphan in him wept . But then he smiled slowly and gracefully , and there was something sad and endearing in his face . He became the da Vinci saint again , or more truly the little god from Caravaggio . And it seemed for a moment he could n't be anything evil or dangerous . He was too radiant , too full of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Not my curses . " Gabrielle and I both nodded . " And when you have need of me , " he said , " I will be here . " Then Gabrielle did the totally surprising thing of embracing him and kissing him . And 1 did the same . He was pliant and gentle and loving in our arms . And he let us know without words that he was going to the coven , and we could find him there tomorrow night . The next moment he was gone , and Gabrielle and I were there alone together , as if he 'd never been in the room . I could hear no sound anywhere in the tower . Nothing but the wind in the forest beyond.  |p277And  when I climbed the steps , I found the gate open and the fields stretching to the woods in unbroken quiet . I loved him . I knew it , as incomprehensible to me as he was . But I was so glad it was finished . So glad that we could go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time just looking at the distant woods , and the dim glow far beyond that the city made upon the lowering clouds . And the grief I felt was not only for the loss of him , it was for Nicki , and for Paris , and for myself . WHEN I came back down to the crypt I saw her building up the fireagain with the last of the wood . In a slow , weary fashion , she stoked the blaze , and the light was red on her profile and in her eyes . I sat quietly on the bench watching her , watching the explosion of sparks against the blackened bricks . " Did he give you what you wanted ? " I asked . " In his own way , yes , " she said . She put the poker aside and sat down opposite , her hair spilling down over her shoulders as she rested her hands beside her on the bench . " I tell you , I do n't care if I never look upon another one of our kind , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their curses , their sorrows . And done with their insufferable humanity , which may be the most astonishing thing they 've revealed . I 'm ready for the world again , Lestat , as I was on the night I died . " " But Marius  --  " I said excitedly . " Mother , there are ancient ones  --  ones who have used immortality in a wholly different way . " " Are there ? " she asked . " Lestat , you 're too generous with your imagination . The story of Marius has the quality of a fairy tale . " " No , that 's not true . " " So the orphan demon claims descent not from the filthy peasant devils he resembles , " she said , " but from a lost lord , almost a god . I tell you any dirty-faced village child dreaming at the kitchen fire can tell you tales like i hat . " " Mother , he could n't have invented Marius , " I said . " I may have a great deal of imagination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up the images . I tell you he saw those things ... " " I had n't thought of it exactly that way , " she admitted with a little smile . " But he could well have borrowed Marius from the legends he heard ... "  | " No , " I said . " There was a Marius and there is a Marius still . And there are others like him . There are Children of the Millennia who have done better than these Children of Darkness with the gifts given them . " " Lestat , what is important is that we do better , " she said . " All I learned from Armand , finally , was that immortals find death seductive and ultimatelyirresistible , that they fail to conquer death or humanity in their minds . Now I want to take that knowledge and wear it like armor as I move through the world . And luckily , I do n't mean the world of change which these creatures have found so dangerous . I mean the world that for eons has been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at the fire again . " It 's of snowcoveredmountains I dream , " she said softly , " of desert wastes  --  of impenetrablejungles , or the great north woods of America where they say white men have never been . " I ler face warmed just a little as she looked at me . " Think on it , " she said . " There is nowhere that we can not go . And if the Children of the Millennia do exist , maybe that is where they are  --  far from the world of men . " " And how do they live if they are ? " I asked . I was picturing my own world and it was full of mortal beings , and the things that mortal beings made . " It 's man we feed on , " I said . " There are hearts that beat in those forests , " she said dreamily . " There is blood that flows for the one who takes it . . . I can do the things now that you used to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her voice trailed off as she was lost in her thoughts . " The important thing , " she said after a long moment , " is that we can go wherever we wish now , Lestat . We 're free . " " I was free before , " I said . " I never cared for what Armand had to tell . But Marius  --  I know that Marius is alive . I feel it . I felt it when Armand told the tale . And Marius knows things  --  and I do n't mean just about us , or about Those Who Must Be Kept or whatever the old mystery  --  he knows things about life itself , about how to move through time . " " So let him be your patron saint if you need it , " she said . This angered me , and I did n't say anything more . The fact was her talk of jungles and forests frightened me . And all the things Armand said to divide us came back to me , just as I 'd known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so we live with our differences , I thought , just as mortals do , and maybe our divisions are exaggerated as are our passions , as is our love . " There was one inkling . . . " she said as she watched the fire , " one little indication that the story of Marius had truth . " " There were a thousand indications , " I said . " He said that Marius slew the evildoer , " she continued , " and he calledp279the evildoer Typhon , the slayer of his brother . Do you remember this ? " " I thought that he meant Cain who had slain Abel . It was Cain I saw in the images , though I heard the other name . " " That 's just it . Armand himself did n't understand the name " Typhon . Yet he repeated it . But I know what it means . " " Tell me . " " It 's from the Greek and Roman myths  --  the old story of the Egyptian god , Osiris , slain by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Underworld . Of course Armand could have read it in Plutarch , but he did n't , that 's the strange thing . " " Ah , you see then , Marius did exist . When he said he 'd lived for a millennium he was telling the truth . " " Perhaps , Lestat , perhaps , " she said . " Mother , tell me this again , this Egyptian story ... " " Lestat , you have years to read all the old tales for yourself . " She rose and bent to kiss me , and I sensed the coldness and sluggishness in her that always carne before dawn . " As for me , I am done with books . They are what I read when I could do nothing else . " She took my two hands in hers . " Tell me that we 'll be on the road tomorrow . That we wo n't see the ramparts of Paris again until we 've seen the other side of the world . " " Exactly as you wish , " I said . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going ? " I said as I followed her . She opened the gate and went out towards the trees . " I want to see if I can sleep in the raw earth itself , " she said over her shoulder . " If I do n't rise tomorrow you 'll know I failed . " " But this is madness , " I said , coming after her . I hated the very idea of it . She went ahead into a thicket of old oaks , and kneeling , she dug into the dead leaves and damp soil with her hands . Ghastly she looked , as if she were a beautiful blond-haired witch scratching with the speed of a beast . Then she rose and waved a farewell kiss to me . And commanding all her strength , she descended as if the earth belonged to her . And I was left staring in disbelief at the emptiness where she had been , and the leaves that had settled as if nothing had disturbed the spot . I WALKED away from the woods . I walked south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I started singing softly to myself some little song , maybe a bit of melody that the violins had played earlier this night in the Palais Royal . And the sense of grief came back to me , the realization that we were really going , that it was finished with Nicolas and finished with the Chil/dren of Darkness and their leader , and I would n't see Paris again , or anything familiar to me , for years and years . And for all my desire to be free , I wanted to weep . But it seems I had some purpose in my wandering that I had n't admitted to myself . A half hour or so before the morning light I was on the post road near the ruin of an old inn . Falling down it was , this last outpost of an abandoned village , with only the heavily mortared walls left intact . And taking out my dagger , I began to carve deep in the soft stone : MARIUS , THE ANCIENT ONE : LESTAT IS SEARCHING FOR YOU . IT IS THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I GO SOUTH FROM PARIS TOWARDS LYONS . PLEASE MAKE YOURSELF ' KNOWN TO ME . What arrogance it seemed when I stepped back from it . And I had already broken the dark commandments , telling the name of an immortal , and putting it into written words . Well , it gave me a wondrous satisfaction to do it . And after all , 1 had never been very good at obeying rules.  |p283THE  last time we saw Armand in the eighteenth century , he wasstanding with Eleni and Nicolas and the other vampire mummers before the door of Renaud 's theater , watching as our carriage made its way into the stream of traffic on the boulevard . I 'd found him earlier closeted in my old dressing room with Nicolas in the midst of a strange conversation dominated by Nicki 's sarcasm and peculiar fire . He wore a wig and a somber red frock coat , and it seemed to me that he had already acquired a new opacity , as if every waking moment since the death of the old coven was giving him greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each other in these last awkward moments , but Armand politely accepted the keys of the tower from me , and a great quantity of money , and the promise of more when he wanted it from Roget . His mind was closed to me , but he said again that Nicolas would come to no harm from him . And as we said our farewells , I believed that Nicolas and the little coven had every chance for survival and that Armand and I were friends . BY THE end of that first night Gabrielle and I were far from Paris , as we vowed we would be , and in the months that followed , we went on to Lyons , Turin , and Vienna , and after that to Prague and Leipzig and St. Petersburg , and then south again to Italy , where we were to settle for many years . Eventually we went on to Sicily , then north into Greece and Turkey , and then south again through the ancient cities of Asia Minor and finally to Cairo , where we remained for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write my messages to Marius on the walls . Sometimes it was no more than a few words that I scratched with the tip of my knife . In other places , I spent hours chiseling my ruminations intop284the stone . But wherever I was , I wrote my name , the date , and my future destination , and my invitation : " Marius , make yourself known to me . " As for the old covens , we were to come upon them in a number of scattered places , but it was clear from the outset that the old ways were everywhere breaking down . Seldom more than three or four vampires carried on the old rituals , and when they came to realize that we wanted no part of them or their existence they let us alone . Infinitely more interesting were the occasional rogues we glimpsed in the middle of society , lone and secretive vampires pretending to be mortal just as skillfully as we could pretend . But we never got close to these creatures . They ran from us as they must have from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their eyes , I was n't tempted to give chase . Yet it was strangely reassuring to know that I had n't been the first aristocratic fiend to move through the ballrooms of the world in search of my victims  --  the deadly gentleman who would soon surface in stories and poetry and penny dreadful novels as the very epitome of our tribe . There were others appearing all the time . But we were to encounter stranger creatures of darkness as we moved on . In Greece we found demons who did not know how they had been made , and sometimes even mad creatures without reason or language who attacked us as if we were mortal , and ran screaming from the prayers we said to drive them away . The vampires in Istanbul actually dwelt in houses , safe behind high wall and gates , their graves in their gardens , and dressed as all humans do in that part of the world , in flowing robes , to hunt the nighttime streets . Yet even they were quite horrified to see me living amongst the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gatherings at the Europeanembassies and homes . They menaced us , shouting incantations at us , and then ran in panic when we turned on them , only to come back and devil us again . The revenants who haunted the Mameluke tombs in Cairo were beastly wraiths , held to the old laws by hollow-eyed masters who lived in the ruins of a Coptic monastery , their rituals full of Eastern magic and the evocation of many demons and evil spirits whom they called by strange names . They stayed clear of us , despite all their acidic threats , yet they knew our names . As the years passed , we learned nothing from all these creatures , which of course was no great surprise to me . And though vampires in many places had heard the legends of Marius and the other ancient ones , they had never seen such beings with their own eyes . Even Armand had become a legend to them , and they were likely to ask : " Did you really see the vampire Armand ? " Nowhere did I meet a trulyp285old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any way a magnetic creature , a being of great wisdom or special accomplishment , an unusual being in whom the Dark Gift had worked any perceivable alchemy that was of interest to me . Armand was a dark god compared to these beings . And so was Gabrielleand so was I.But I jump ahead of my tale . Early on , when we first came into Italy , we gained a fuller and more sympathetic knowledge of the ancient rituals . The Roman coven came out to welcome us with open arms . " Come to the Sabbat , " they said . " Come into the catacombs and join in the hymns . " Yes , they knew that we 'd destroyed the Paris coven , and bested the great master of dark secrets , Armand . But they did n't despise us for it . On the contrary , they could not understand the cause of Armand 's resignation of his power . Why had n't the coven changed with the times ? For even here where the ceremonies were so elaborate and sensuous that they took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ways of men , thought nothing of passing themselves off as human whenever it suited their purposes . It was the same with the two vampires we had seen in Venice , and the handful we were later to meet in Florence as well . In black cloaks , they penetrated the crowds at the opera , the shadowy corridors of great houses during balls and banquets , and even sometimes sat amid the press in lowly taverns or wine shops , peering at humans quite close at hand . It was their habit here more than anywhere to dress in the costumes of the time of their birth , and they were often splendidly attired and most regal , possessing jewels and finery and showing it often to great advantage when they chose . Yet they crept back to their stinking graveyards to sleep , and they fled screaming from any sign of heavenly power , and they threw themselves with savage abandon into their horrifying and beautiful Sabbats . In comparison , the vampires of Paris had been primitive , coarse , and childlike ; but I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris that had caused Armand and his flock to retreat so far from mortal ways . As the French capital became secular , the vampires had clung to old magic , while the Italian fiends lived among deeply religious humans whose lives were drenched in Roman Catholic ceremony , men and women who respected evil as they respected the Roman Church . In sum the old ways of the fiends were not unlike the old ways of people in Italy , and so the Italian vampires moved in both worlds . Did they believe in the old ways ? They shrugged . The Sabbat for them was a grand pleasure . Had n't Gabrielleand I enjoyed it ? Had we not finally joined in the dance ?  | " Come to us anytime that you wish , " the Roman vampires told us . As for this Theater of the Vampires in Paris , this great scandal which was shocking our kind the world over , well , they would believe that when they saw it with their own eyes . Vampires performing on a stage , vampires dazzling mortal audiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terribly Parisian ! They laughed . OF COURSE I was hearing more directly about the theater all the time . Before I 'd even reached St. Petersburg , Roget had sent me a long testament to the " cleverness " of the new troupe : They have gotten themselves up like giant wooden marionettes he wrote . Gold cords come down from the rafters to their ankles and their wrists and the tops of their heads , and by these they appear to be manipulated in the most charming dances . They wear perfect circlesof rouge on their white cheeks , and their eyes are wide as glass buttons . You can not believe the perfection with which they make themselves appear inanimate . But the orchestra is another marvel . Faces blank and painted in the very same style , the players imitate mechanical musicians  --  the jointed dolls one can buy that , on the winding of a key , saw away at their little instruments , or blow their little horns , to make real music ! It is such an engaging spectacle that ladies and gentlemen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these playersare dolls or real persons . Some aver that they are all made of wood and the voices coming out of the actors ' mouths are the work of ventriloquists . As for the plays themselves , they would be extremely unsettling were they not so beautiful and skillfully done . There is one most popular drama they do which features a vampiric revenant , risen from the grave through a platform in the stage . Terrifyingis the creature with rag mop hair and fangs . But lo , he falls in love at once with a giant wooden puppet woman , never guessing that she is not alive . Unable to drink blood from her throat , however , the poor vampire soon perishes , at which moment the marionette reveals that she does indeed live , though she is made of wood , and with an evil smile she performs a triumphant dance upon the body of the defeated fiend . I tell you it makes the blood run cold to see it . Yet the audience screams and applauds . In another little tableau , the puppet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let herself be bound up with golden cords as if she too were a marionette . The sorry result is that the strings make her dance till the life goes out of her body . She pleads with eloquent gestures to be released , but the real puppets only laugh and cavort as she expires . The music is unearthly . It brings to mind the gypsies of the country fairs . Monsieur de Lenfent is the director . And it is the sound of his violin which often opens the evening fare . I advise you as your attorney to claim some of the profits being made by this remarkable company . The lines for each performance stretch a considerable length down the boulevard . Roget 's letters always unsettled me . They left me with my heart tripping , and I could n't help but wonder : What had I expected the troupe to do ? Why did their boldness and inventiveness surprise me ? We all had the power to do such things . By the time I settled in Venice , where I spent a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was hearing from Eleni directly , her letters inscribed with exquisite vampiric skill . They were the most popular entertainment in nighttime Paris , she wrote to me . " Actors " had come from all over Europe to join them . So their troupe had swelled to twenty in number , which even that metropolis could scarce " support . " " Only the most clever artists are admitted , those who possess truly astonishing talent , but we prize discretion above all else . We do not like scandal , as you can well guess . " As for their " Dear Violinist , " she wrote of him affectionately , saying he was their greatest inspiration , that he wrote the most ingenious plays , taking them from stories that he read . " But when he is not at work , he can be quite impossible . He must be watched constantly so that he does not enlarge our ranks . His dining habits are extremely sloppy . And on occasion he says most shocking things to strangers , which fortunately they are too sensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make other vampires . And he did n't hunt in stealth . In the main it is Our Oldest Friend Armand , obviously who is relied upon to restrain him . And that he does with the most caustic threats . But I must say that these do not have an enduring effect upon Our Violinist . He talks often of old religious customs , of ritual fires , of the passage into new realms of being . I can not say that we do not love him . For your sake we would carep288for him even if we did not . But we do love him . And Our Oldest Friend , in particular , bears him great affection . Yet I should remark that in the old times , such persons would not have endured among us for very long . As for Our Oldest Friend , I wonder if you would know him now . He has built a great manse at the foot of your tower , and there he lives among books and pictures very like a scholarly gentleman with little care for the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door of the theater in his black carriage . And he watches from his own curtained box . And he comes after to settle all disputes among us , to govern as he always did , to threaten Our Divine Violinist , but he will never , never consent to perform on the stage . It is he who accepts new members among us . As 1 told you , they come from all over . We do not have to solicit them . They knock upon our door ... . Come back to us she wrote in closing . You will find us more interesting than you did before . There are a thousand dark wonders which I can not commit to paper . We are a starburst in the history of our kind . And we could not have chosen a more perfect moment in the history of this great city for our little contrivance . And it is your doing , this splendid existence we sustain . Why did you leave us ? Come home . I saved these letters . I kept them as carefully as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw the marionettes perfectly in my imagination . I heard the cry of Nicki 's violin . I saw Armand , too , arriving in his dark carriage , taking his seat in the box . And I even described all of this in veiled and eccentric terms in my long messages to Marius , working in a little frenzy now and then with my chisel in a dark street while mortals slept . But for me , there was no going back to Paris , no matter how lonely I might become . The world around me had become my lover and my teacher . I was enraptured with the cathedrals and castles , the museums and palaces that I saw . In every place I visited , I went to the heart of society : I drank up its entertainments and its gossip , its literature and its music , its architecture and its art . I could fill volumes with the things I studied , the things I struggled to understand . I was enthralled by gypsy violinists and street puppeteers as I was by great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I prowled the brothels and the gambling dens and the places where the sailors drank and quarreled . I read the newspapers everywhere I went and hung about in taverns , often ordering food I never touched , merely top289have it in front of me , and I talked to mortals incessantly in public places , buying countless glasses of wine for others , smelling their pipes and cigars as they smoked , and letting all these mortal smells get into my hair and clothes . And when I was n't out roaming , I was traveling the realm of the books that had belonged to Gabrielle so exclusively all through those dreary mortal years at home . Before we even got to Italy , I knew enough Latin to be studying the classics , and I made a library in the old Venetian palazzo I haunted , often reading the whole night long . And of course it was the tale of Osiris that enchanted me , bringing back with it the romance of Armand 's story and Marius 's enigmatic words . As I pored over all the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here we have an ancient king , Osiris , a man of unworldly goodness who turns the Egyptians away from cannibalism and teaches them the art of growing crops and making wine . And how is he murdered by his brother Typhon ? Osiris is tricked into lying down in a box made to the exact size of his body , and his brother Typhon then nails shut the lid . He is then thrown into the river , and when his faithful Isis finds his body , he is again attacked by Typhon , who dismembers him . All parts of his body are found save one . Now , why would Marius make reference to a myth such as this ? And how could I not think on the fact that all vampires sleep in coffins which are boxes made to the size of their bodies  --  even the miserable rabble of les Innocents slept in their coffins . Magnus said to me , " In that box or its like you must always lie . " As for the missing part of the body , the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of us which is not enhanced by the Dark Gift , is n't there ? We can speak , see , taste , breathe , move as humans move , but we can not procreate . And neither could Osiris , so he became Lord of the Dead . Was this a vampire god ? But so much puzzled me and tormented me . This god Osiris was the god of wine to the Egyptians , the one later called Dionysus by the Greeks . And Dionysus was the " dark god " of the theater , the devil god whom Nicki described to me when we were boys at home . And now we had the theater full of vampires in Paris . Oh , it was too rich . I could n't wait to tell all this to Gabrielle . But she dismissed it indifferently , saying there were hundreds of such old stories . " Osiris was the god of the corn , " she said . " He was a good god to the Egyptians . What could this have to do with us ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a great deal to learn , my son . Many an ancient god was dismembered and mourned by his goddess . Read of Actaeon and Adonis . The ancients loved those stories . " And she was gone . And I was alone in the candlelighted library , leaning on my elbows amid all these books . I brooded on Armand 's dream of the sanctuary of Those Who Must Be Kept in the mountains . Was it a magic that went back to the Egyptian times ? How had the Children of Darkness forgotten such things ? Maybe it had all been poetry to the Venetian master , the mention of Typhon , the slayer of his brother , nothing more than that . I went out into the night with my chisel . I wrote my questions to Marius on stones that were older than us both . Marius had become so real to me that we were talking together , the way that Nicki and I had once done . He was the confidant who received my excitement , my enthusiasm , my sublime bewilderment at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my studies deepened , as my education broadened , I was getting that first awesome inkling of what eternity might be . I was alone among humans , and my writing to Marius could n't keep me from knowing my own monstrosity as I had in those first Paris nights so long ago . After all , Marius was n't really there . And neither was Gabrielle . Almost from the beginning , Armand 's predictions had proved true. 2EFORE we were even out of France , Gabrielle was breaking thejourney to disappear for several nights at a time . In Vienna , she often stayed away for over a fortnight , and by the time I settled in the palazzo in Venice she was going away for months on end . During my first visit to Rome , she vanished for a half year . And after she left me in Naples , I returned to Venice without her , angrily leaving her to find her way back to the Veneto on her own , which she did . Of course it was the countryside that drew her , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings lived . And she would return in such a tattered state  --  her shoes worn out , her clothes ripped , her hair in hopeless tangles  --  that she was every bit as frightening to look at as the ragged members of the old Paris coven had been . Then she 'd walk aboutp291my rooms in her dirty neglected garments staring at the cracks in the plaster or the light caught in the distortions of the hand-blown window glass . Why should immortals pore over newspapers , she would ask , or dwell in palaces ? Or carry gold in their pockets ? Or write letters to a mortal family left behind ? In an eerie , rapid undertone she 'd speak of cliffs she had climbed , the drifts of snow through which she had tumbled , the caves full of mysterious markings and ancient fossils that she had found . Then she would go as silently as she 'd come , and I would be left watching for her and waiting for her  --  and bitter and angry at her , and resenting her when she finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Verona , she startled me in a dark street . " Is your father still alive ? " she asked . Two months she 'd been gone that time . I 'd missed her bitterly , and there she was asking about them as if they mattered finally . Yet when I answered , " Yes , and very ill , " she seemed not to hear . I tried to tell her then that things in France were bleak indeed . There would surely be a revolution . She shook her head and waved it all away . " Do n't think about them anymore , " she said . " Forget them . " And once again , she was gone . The truth was , I did n't want to forget them . I never stopped writing to Roget for news of my family . I wrote to him more often than I wrote to Eleni at the theater . I 'd sent for portraits of my nieces and nephews . I sent presents back to France from every place in which I stopped . And I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And finally , as Gabrielle 's absences grew longer and our times together more strained and uncertain , I started to argue with her about these things . " Time will take our family , " I said . " Time will take the France we knew . So why should I give them up now while I can still have them ? I need these things , I tell you . This is what life is to me ! " But this was only the half of it . I did n't have her any more than I had the others . She must have known what I was really saying . She must have heard the recriminations behind it all . Little speeches like this saddened her . They brought out the tenderness in her . She 'd let me get clean clothes for her , comb out her hair . And after hat we 'd hunt together and talk together . Maybe she would even go to the casinos with me , or to the opera . She 'd be a great and beautiful lady for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They perpetuated our belief that we were still a little coven , a pair of lovers , prevailing against the mortal world.  |p292Gathered  by the fire in some country villa , riding together on the driver 's seat of the coach as I held the reins , walking together through the midnight forest , we still exchanged our various observations now and then . We even went in search of haunted houses together  --  a newfound pastime that excited us both . In fact , Gabrielle would sometimes return from one of her journeys precisely because she had heard of a ghostly visitation and she wanted me to go with her to see what we could . Of course , most of the time we found nothing in the empty buildings where spirits were supposed to appear . And those wretched persons supposedto be possessed by the devil were often no more than commonly insane . Yet there were times when we saw fleeting apparitions or mayhem that we could n't explain  --  objects flung about , voices roaring from the mouths of possessed children , icy currents that blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never learned anything from all this . We saw no more than a hundred mortal scholars had already described . It was just a game to us finally . And when I look back on it now , I know we went on with it because it kept us together  --  gave us convivial moments which otherwise we would not have had . But Gabrielle 's absences were n't the only thing destroying our affection for each other as the years passed . It was her manner when she was with me  --  the ideas she would put forth . She still had that habit of speaking exactly what was on her mind and little more . One night in our little house in the Via Ghibellina in Florence , she appeared after a month 's absence and started to expound at once . " You know the creatures of the night are ripe for a great leader , " she said . " Not some superstitious mumbler of old rites , but a great dark monarchwho will galvanize us according to new principles . " " What principles ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Imagine , " she said , " not merely this stealthy and loathsome feeding on mortals , but something grand as the Tower of Babel was grand before it was brought down by the wrath of God . I mean a leader set up in a Satanic palace who sends out his followers to turn brother against brother , to cause mothers to kill their children , to put all the fine accomplishments of mankind to the torch , to scorch the land itself so that all would die of hunger , innocent and guilty ! Make suffering and chaos wherever you turn , and strike down the forces of good so that men despair . Now that is something worthy of being called evil . ' That is what the work of a devil really is . We are nothing , you and I , except exotica in the Savage Garden ,  |p293as  you told me . And the world of men is no more or less now than what I saw in my books in the Auvergne years ago . " I hated this conversation . And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I was speaking to somebody other than a poor deceived mortal . That I was n't alone with my letters from home . " But what about your aesthetic questions ? " I asked . " What you explained to Armand before , that you wanted to know why beauty existed and why it continues to affect us ? " She shrugged . " When the world of man collapses in ruin , beauty will take over . The trees shall grow again where there were streets ; the flowers will again cover the meadow that is now a dank field of hovels . That shall be the purpose of the Satanic master , to see the wild grass and the dense forest cover up all trace of the once great cities until nothing remains . " " And why call all this Satanic ? " I asked . " Why not call it chaos ? That is all it would be . " " Because , " she said , " that is what men would call it . They invented Satan , did n't they ? Satanic is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would disrupt the orderly way in which men want to live . " " I do n't see it . " " Well , use your preternatural brain , my blue-eyed one , " she answered , " my golden-haired son , my handsome wolfkiller . It is very possible that God made the world as Armand said . " " This is what you discovered in the forest ? You were told this by the leaves ? " She laughed at me . " Of course , God is not necessarily anthropomorphic , " she said . " Or what we would call , in our colossal egotism and sentimentality , a decent person . ' But there is probably God . Satan , however , was man 's invention , a name for the force that seeks to overthrow the civilized order of things . ' I'he first man who made laws  --  be he Moses or some ancient Egyptian king Osiris  --  that lawmaker created the devil . The devil meant the one who tempts you to break the laws . And we are truly Satanic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So why not truly disrupt ? Why not make a blaze of evil to consume all the civilizations of the earth ? " I was too appalled to answer . " Do n't worry . " She laughed . " I wo n't do it . But I wonder what will happen in the decades to come . Will not somebody do it ? " " I hope not ! " I said . " Or let me put it this way . If one of us tries , then there shall be war . " " Why ? Everyone will follow him . " " I will not . I will make the war . "  | " Oh , you are too amusing , Lestat , " she said . " It 's petty , " I said . " Petty ! " She had looked away , out into the courtyard , but she looked back and the color rose in her face . " To topple all the cities of the earth ? I understood when you called the Theater of the Vampires petty , but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to destroy anything merely for the sake of the destroying , do n't you think ? " " You 're impossible , " she said . " Sometime in the far future there may be such a leader . He will reduce man to the nakedness and fear from which he came . And we shall feed upon him effortlessly as we have always done , and the Savage Garden , as you call it , will cover the world . " " I almost hope someone does attempt it , " I said . " Because I would rise up against him and do everything to defeat him . And possibly I could be saved , I could be good again in my own eyes , as I set out to save man from this . " I was very angry . I 'd left my chair and walked out into the courtyard . She came right behind me . " You have just given the oldest argument in Christendom for the existence of evil , " she said . " It exists so that we may fight it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " What I do n't understand about you is this , " she said . " You hold to your old belief in goodness with a tenacity that is virtually unshakable . Yet you are so good at being what you are ! You hunt your victims like a dark angel . You kill ruthlessly . You feast all the night long on victims when you choose . " " So ? " I looked at her coldly . " I do n't know how to be bad at being ; bad . " She laughed . " I was a good marksman when I was a young man , " I said , " a good actor on the stage . And now I am a good vampire . So much for our understanding of the word good . ' " AFTER she had gone , I lay on my back on the flagstones in the courtyard and looked up at the stars , thinking of all the paintings and the sculptures that I had seen merely in the single city of Florence . I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the softest and sweetest music to me was the sound of human voices . But what did it matter rcallv what I thought or felt ? But she did n't always bludgeon me with strange philosophy . Now and then when she appeared , she spoke of the practical things she 'd learned . Shep295was actually braver and more adventurous than 1 was . She taught me things . We could sleep in the earth , she had ascertained that before we ever left France . Coffins and graves did not matter . And she would find herself rising n'turally out of the earth at sunset even before she was awake . And those mortals who did find us during the daylight hours , unless they exposed us to the sun at once , were doomed . For example , outside Palermo she had slept in a cellar far below an abandoned house , and when she had awakened , her eyes and face were burning as if they had been scalded , and she had in her right hand a mortal , quite dead , who had apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , " and my hand was still locked on his throat . And my face had been burned by the little light that leaked down from the opened door . " " What if there had been several mortals ? " I asked , vaguely enchanted with her . She shook her head and shrugged . She always slept in the earth now , not in cellars or coffins . No one would ever disturb her rest again . It did not matter to her . I um not say so , but I believed there was a grace in sleeping in the crypt . There was a romance to rising from the grave . I was in fact going to the very opposite extreme in that I had coffins made for myself in places where we lingered , and I slept not in the graveyard or the church , . as was our most common custom , but in hiding places within the house . I ca n't say that she did n't sometimes patiently listen to me when I told her these things . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art I had seen in the Vatican museum , or the chorus I had heard in the cathedral , or the dreams I had in the last hour before rising , dreams that seemed to be sparked by the thoughts of mortals passing my lair . But maybe she was watching my lips move . Who could possibly tell ? And then she was gone again without explanation , and I walked the streets alone , whispering aloud to Marius and writing to him the long , long messages that took the whole night sometimes to complete . What did I want of her , that she be more human , that she be like me ? Armand 's predictions obsessed me . And how could she not think of them ? She must have known what was happening , that we were growing everrther apart , that my heart was breaking and I had too much pride to sayto her . " Please , Gabrielle , I can not endure the loneliness ! Stay with me . " By the time we left Italy I was playing dangerous little games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman  --  a human being who looked perfectp296to me spiritually  --  and I would follow the human about . Maybe for a week I 'd do this , then a month , sometimes even longer than that . I 'd fall in love with the being . I 'd imagine friendship , conversation , intimacy that we could never have . In some magical and imaginary moment I would say : " But you see what I am , " and this human being , in supreme spiritual understanding , would say : " Yes , I see . I understand . " Nonsense , really . Very like the fairy tale where the princess gives her selfless love to the prince who is enchanted and he is himself again and the monster no more . Only in this dark fairy tale I would pass right into my mortal lover . We would become one being , and I would be flesh and blood again . Lovely idea , that . Only I began to think more and more of Armand 's warnings , that I 'd work the Dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . And I stopped playing the game altogether . I merely went huntingwith all the old vengeance and cruelty , and it was n't merely the evildoer I brought down . IN THE City of Athens I wrote the following message to Marius : " I do not know why I go on . I do not search for truth . I do not believe in it . I hope for no ancient secrets from you , whatever they may be . But I believe in something . Maybe simply in the beauty of the world through which I wander or in the will to live itself . This gift was given to me too early . It was given for no good reason . And already at the age of thirty mortal years , I have some understanding as to why so many of our kind have wasted it , given it up . Yet I continue . And I search for you . " How long I could have wandered through Europe and Asia in this fashion I do not know . For all my complaints about loneliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were new cities as there were new victims , new languages , and new music to hear . No matter what my pain , I fixed my mind on a new destination . I wanted to know all the cities of the earth , finally , even the far-off capitals of India and China , where the simplest objects would seem alien and the minds I pierced as strange as those of creatures from another world . But as we went south from Istanbul into Asia Minor , Gabrielle felt the allure of the new and strange land even more strongly , so that she was scarcely ever at my side . And things were reaching a horrid climax in France , not merely with the mortal world I still grieved for , but with the vampires of the theater as well.  |p297BEFORE  I ever left Greece , I 'd been hearing disturbing news fromEnglish and French travelers of the troubles at home . And when I reached the European hostelry in Ankara there was a large packet of letters waiting for me . Roget had moved all of my money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must not consider returning to Paris , " he wrote . " I have advised your father and your brothers to keep out of all controversy . It is not the climate for monarchists here . " Eleni 's letters spoke in their own way of the same things : Audiences want to see the aristocracy made fools of . Our little play featuring a clumsy queen puppet , who is trampled mercilessly by the mindless troop of puppet soldiers whom she seeks to command , draws loud laughter and screams . The clergy is also ripe for derision : In another little drama we have a bumptious priest come to chastise a group of dancing-girl marionettesfor their indecent conduct . But alas , their dancing master , who is in fact a red-horned devil , turns the unfortunate cleric into a werewolfwho ends his days kept by the laughing girls in a golden cage . All this is the genius of Our Divine Violinist , but we must now be with him every waking moment . To force him to write we tie him to the chair . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this fails , we make him dictate as we write down the plays . In the streets he would accost the passers-by and tell them passionatelythere are horrors in this world of which they do not dream . And I assure you , if Paris were not so busy reading pamphlets that deotnunceQueen Marie Antoinette , he might have undone us all by now . Our Oldest Friend becomes more angry with every passing night . Of course I wrote to her at once , begging her to be patient with Nicki , to try to help him through these first years . " Surely he can be influenced , " I said . And for the first time I asked : " Would I have the power to alter things if I were to return ? " I stared at the words for a long time before dgning my name . My hands were trembling . Then I sealed the letter and posted it at once . How could I go back ? Lonely as I was , I could n't bear the thought of lfrvturning to Paris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I dop298for Nicolas when I got there ? Armand 's long-ago admonition was a din in my ears . In fact , it seemed no matter where I was that Armand and Nicki were both with me , Armand full of grim warnings and predictions , and Nicolas taunting me with the little miracle of love turned into hate . I had never needed Gabrielle as I did now . But she had gone ahead on our journey long ago . Now and then I remembered the way it had been before we ever left Paris . But I did n't expect anything from her anymore . At Damascus , Eleni 's answer was waiting for me . He despises you as much as ever . When we suggest that perhaps he should go to you , he laughs and laughs . I tell you these things not to haunt you but to let you know that we do our utmost to protect this child who should never have been Born to Darkness . He is overwhelmedby his powers , dazzled and maddened by his vision . We have seen it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written his greatest play this last month . The marionette dancers , sans strings for this one , are , in the flower of their youth , struck down by a pestilence and laid beneath tombstones and flower wreaths to rest . The priest weeps over them before he goes away . But a young violinist magician comes to the cemetery . And by means of his music makes them rise . As vampires dressed all in black silk ruffles and black satin ribbons , they come out of the graves , dancing merrily as they follow the violinist towards Paris , a beautifully rendered paintingon the scrim . The crowd positively roars . I tell you we could feast on mortal victims on the stage and the Parisians , thinking it all the most novel illusion , would only cheer . There was also a frightening letter from Roget : Paris was in the grip of revolutionary madness . King Louis had been forced to recognize the National Assembly . The people of all classes were uniting against him as never before . Roget had sent a messenger south to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the countrysidefor himself . I answered both letters with all the predictable concern and all the predictable feeling of helplessness . But as I sent my belongings on to Cairo , I had the dread that all those things upon which I depended were in danger . Outwardly , I was unchangedas I continued my masquerade as the traveling gentleman ; inwardlythe demon hunter of the crooked back streets was silently and secretly lost . Of course I told myself that it was important to go south to Egypt , thoup299Egypt was a land of ancient grandeur and timeless marvels , that Egypt would enchant me and make me forget the things happening in Paris which I was powerless to change . But there was a connection in my mind . Egypt , more than any other land the world over , was a place in love with death . Finally Gabrielle came like a spirit out of the Arabian desert , and together we set sail . It WAS almost a month before we reached Cairo , and when I found my belongings waiting for me in the European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eleni 's writing immediately , but I could not think why she would send me a package and I stared at the thing for a full quarter of an hour , my mind as blank as it had ever been . There was not a word from Roget . Why has n't Roget written to me , I thought . What is this package ? Why is it here ? At last I realized that for an hour I had been sitting in a room with a lot of trunks and packing cases and staring at a package and that Gabrielle , who had not seen fit to vanish yet , was merely watching me . " Would you go out ? " I whispered . " If you wish , " she said . It was important to open this , yes , to open it and find out what it was . yet it seemed just as important for me to look around the barren little room and imagine that it was a room in a village inn in the Auvergne . " I had a dream about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I dreamed that we were moving through the world together , you and I , and we were both serene and strong . I dreamed we fed on the evildoer as Marius had done , and as we looked about ourselves we felt awe and sorrow at the mysteries we beheld . But we were strong . We would go on forever . And we talked . Our conversation ' went on and on . " I tore back the wrapping and saw the case of the Stradivarius violin . I went to say something again , just to myself , but my throat closed . And my mind could n't carry out the words on its own . I reached for theletter which had slipped to one side over the polished wood . It has come to the worst , as I feared . Our Oldest Friend , maddened by the excesses of Our Violinist , finally imprisoned him in your old residence . And though his violin was given him in his cell , his hands were taken away . But understand that with us , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question were kept safe by Our Oldest Friend , who allowed our wounded one no sustenance for five nights . Finally , after the entire troupe had prevailed upon Our Oldest Friend to release N. and give back to him all that was his , it was done . But N. , maddened by the pain and the starvation  --  for this can alter the temperament completely  --  slipped into unbreakable silence and remained so for a considerable length of time . At last he came to us and spoke only to tell us that in the manner of a mortal he had put in order his business affairs . A stack of freshly written plays was ours to have . And we must call together for him somewhere in the countryside the ancient Sabbat with its customary blaze . If we did not , then he should make the theater his funeral pyre . Our Oldest Friend solemnly granted his wish and you have never seen such a Sabbat as this , for I think we looked all the more hellish in our wigs and fine clothes , our black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing with an actor 's bravado the old chants . " We should have done it on the boulevard , " he said . " But here , send this on to my maker , " and he put the violin in my hands . We began to dance , all of us , to induce the customary frenzy , and I think we were never more moved , never more in terror , never more sad . He went into the flames . I know how this news will affect you . But understand we did all that we could to prevent what occurred . Our Oldest Friend was bitter and grieved . And I think you should know that when we returned to Paris , we discovered that N. had ordered the theater to be named officially the Theater of the Vampires and these words had already been painted on the front . As his best plays have always included vampires and werewolves and other such supernatural creatures , the public thinks the new title very amusing , and no one has moved to change it . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later when I finally went down the stairs into the street , I saw a pale and lovely ghost in the shadows  --  image of the young French explorerin soiled white linen and brown leather boots , straw hat down over the eyes . I knew who she was , of course , and that we had once loved each other , she and I , but it seemed for the moment to be something I could scarce remember , or truly believe . I think I wanted to say something mean to her , to wound her and drive her away . But when she came up beside me and walked with me , I did n't say anything . I merely gave the letter to her so that we did n't have to talk.  |p301And  she read it and put it away , and then she had her arm around me again the way she used to long ago , and we were walking together through the black streets . Smell of death and cooking fires , of sand and camel dung . Egypt smell . Smell of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What can I do for you , my darling ? " she whispered . " Nothing , " I said . It was I who did it , I who seduced him , made him what he was , and left him there . It was I who subverted the path his life might have taken . A nd so in dark obscurity , removed from its human course , it comes to this . LATER she stood silent as I wrote my message to Marius on an ancient temple wall . I told about the end of Nicolas , the violinist of the Theater of the Vampires , and I carved my words deep as any ancient Egyptian craftsmanmight have done . Epitaph for Nicki , a milestone in oblivion , which none might ever read or understand . I WAS strange to have her there . Strange to have her staying with me hour by hour . " You wo n't go back to France , will you ? " she asked me finally . " You wo n't go back on account of what he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " The cutting off of the hands ? " She looked at me and her face smoothed out as if some shock had robbed it of expression . But she knew . She had read the letter . What shocked her ? The way I said it perhaps . " You thought I would go back to get revenge ? " She nodded uncertainly . She did n't want to put the idea in my head . " How could I do that ? " I said . " It would be hypocrisy , would n't it , when I left Nicolas there counting on them all to do whatever had to be done ? " The changes in her face were too subtle to describe . I did n't like to see hrr feel so much . It was n't like her . " The fact is , the little monster was trying to help when he did it , do n't you think , when he cut off the hands . It must have been a lot of trouble to him , really , when he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance . " She nodded , but she looked miserable , and as luck would have it , beautiful , too . " I rather thought so , " she said . " But I did n't think you would agree .. " Oh . I 'm monster enough to understand it , " I said . " I ) o you rememberp302what you told me years ago , before we ever left home ? You said it the very day that he came up the mountain with the merchants to give me the red cloak . You said that his father was so angry with him for his violin playing that he was threatening to break his hands . Do you think we find our destiny somehow , no matter what happens ? I mean , do you think that even as immortals we follow some path that was already marked for us when we were alive ? Imagine it , the coven master cut off his hands . " IT WAS clear in the nights that followed that she did n't want to leave me alone . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's death , no matter where we were . But it made a difference that we were in Egypt . It helped that she loved these ruins and these monuments as she had loved none before . Maybe people had to be dead six thousand years for her to love them . I thought of saying that to her , teasing her with it a little , but the thought merely came and went . These monuments were as old as the mountains she loved . The Nile had coursed through the imagination of man since the dawn of recorded time . We scaled the pyramids together , we climbed into the arms of the giant Sphinx . We pored over inscriptions on ancient stone fragments . We studied the mummies one could buy from thieves for a pittance , bits of old jewelry , pottery , glass . We let the water of the river move through our fingers , and we hunted the tiny streets of Cairo together , and we went into the brothels to sit back on the pillows and watch the boys dance and hear the musicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little while the sound of a violin that was always in my head . I found myself rising and dancing wildly to these exotic sounds , imitatingthe undulations of those who urged me on , as I lost all sense of time or reason in the wail of the horns , the strumming of the lutes . Gabrielle sat still , smiling , with the brim of her soiled white straw hat over her eyes . We did not talk to each other anymore . She was just some pale and feline beauty , cheek smudged with dirt , who drifted through the endless night at my side . Her coat cinched by a thick leather belt , her hair in a braid down her back , she walked with a queen 's posture and a vampire 's languor , the curve of her cheek luminous in the darkness , her small mouth a blur of rose red . Lovely and soon to be gone again , no doubt . Yet she remained with me even when I leased a lavish little dwelling , once the house of a Mameluke lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceilings . She even helped me fill the courtyardwith bougainvillea and palms and every kind of tropical plant until itp303was a verdant little jungle . She brought in the caged parrots and finches and brilliant canaries herself . She even nodded now and then sympathetically when 1 murmured there were no letters from Paris , and I was frantic for news . Why had n't Roget written to me ? Had Paris erupted into riots and mayhem ? Well , it would never touch my distant provincial family , would it ? But had something happened to Roget ? Why did n't he write ? She asked me to go upriver with her . I wanted to wait for letters , to question the English travelers . But I agreed . After all , it was rather remarkablereally that she wanted me to come with her . She was caring for me in her own way . I knew she 'd taken to dressing in fresh white linen frock coats and breeches only to please me . For me , she brushed out her long hair . But it did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel it . I was drifting through the world as if it were a dream . It seemed very natural and reasonable that around me I should see a landscape that looked exactly as it had thousands of years ago when artists painted it on the walls of royal tombs . Natural that the palm trees in the uuoonlight should look exactly as they looked then . Natural that the peasant should draw his water from the river in the same manner as he had done then . And the cows he watered were the same too . Visions of the world when the world had been new . Had Marius ever stood in these sands ? We wandered through the giant temple of Ramses , enchanted by the millions upon millions of tiny pictures cut into the walls . I kept thinking of Osiris , but the little figures were strangers . We prowled the ruins of Luxor . We lay in the riverboat together under the stars . On our way back to Cairo when we came to the great Colossi of Memnon , she told in a passionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at these statues just as we did now . " They were ancient in the times of the Caesars , " she said , as we rode our camels through the cool sands . " I'he wind was not so bad as it could have been on this night . We could we the immense stone figures clearly against the deep blue sky . Faces blasted away , they seemed nevertheless to stare forward , mute witnesses to the passage of time , whose stillness made me sad and afraid . I felt the same wonder I had known before the pyramids . Ancient gods , ancient mysteries . It made the chills rise . And yet what were these figures now but faceless sentinels , rulers of an endless waste ? " Marius , " I whispered to myself . " Have you seen these ? Will any one of us endure so long ? "  |p304But  my reverie was broken by Gabrielle . She wanted to dismount and walk the rest of the way to the statues . I was game for it , though I did n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how to make them kneel down and all that . - She did it . And she left them waiting for us , and we walked through the sand . " Come with me into Africa , into the jungles , " she said . Her face was grave , her voice unusually soft . I did n't answer for a moment . Something in her manner alarmed me . Or at least it seemed I should have been alarmed . I should have heard a sound as sharp as the morning chime of Hell 's Bells . I did n't want to go into the jungles of Africa . And she knew I did n't . I was anxiously awaiting news of my family from Roget , and I had it in my mind to seek the cities of the Orient , to wander through India into China and on to Japan . " I understand the existence you 've chosen , " she said . " And I 've come to admire the perseverance with which you pursue it , you must know that . " " I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bitterly . She stopped . We were as near to the colossal statues as one should get , I suppose . And the only thing that saved them from overwhelming me was that there was nothing near at hand to put them in scale . The sky overhead was as immense as they were , and the sands endless , and the stars countless and brilliant and rising forever overhead . " Lestat , " she said slowly , measuring her words , " I am asking you to try , only once , to move through the world as I do . " The moon shone full on her , but the hat shadowed her small angular white face . " Forget the house in Cairo , " she said suddenly , dropping her voice as if in respect for the importance of what she said . " Abandon all your valuables , your clothes , the things that link you with civilization . Come south with me , up the river into Africa . Travel with me as I travel . " Still I did n't answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath that we would see the secret tribes of Africa unknown to the world . We would fight the crocodile and the lion with our bare hands . We might find the source of the Nile itself . I began to tremble all over . It was as if the night were full of howling winds . And there was no place to go . You are saying you will leave me forever if I do n't come . Is n't that it ? I looked up at these horrific statues . I think I said : " So it comes to this . "  |p305And  this was why she had stayed close to me , this was why she had dome so many little things to please , this was why we were together now . It had nothing to do with Nicki gone into eternity . It was another parting that concerned her now . She shook her head as if communing with herself , debating on how to go on . In a hushed voice she described to me the heat of tropical nights , wetter , sweeter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " By day I sleep in the sand . By night I am on the wing as if I could truly fly . I need no name . I leave no footprints . I want to go down to the very tip of Africa . I will be a goddess to those I slay . " She approached and slipped her arm about my shoulder and pressed her lips to my cheek , and I saw the deep glitter of her eyes beneath the brim of her hat . And the moonlight icing her mouth . I heard myself sigh . I shook my head . " I ca n't and you know it , " I said . " I ca n't do it any more than you can stay with me . " ALL the way back to Cairo , I thought on it , what had come to me in those painful moments . What I had known but not said as we stood before the Colossi of Memnon in the sand . She was already lost to me ! She had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the stairs from the room in which I grieved for Nicki and I had seen her waiting for me . It had all been said in one form or another in the crypt beneath the tower years ago . She could not give me what I wanted of her . There was nothing I could do to make her what she would not be . And the truly terrible part was this : she really did n't want anything of me ! She was asking me to come because she felt the obligation to do so . Pity , sadness  --  maybe those were also reasons . But what she really wanted was to be free . She stayed with me as we returned to the city . She did and said nothing . And I was sinking even lower , silent , stunned , knowing that another dreadful blow would soon fall . There was the clarity and the horror . She will say her farewell , and I ca n't prevent it . When do I start to lose my senses ? When do I begin to cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the little house , the colors assaulted me  --  Persian carpets covered with delicate flowers , the tentwork woven with a million tiny mirrors , the brilliant plumage of the fluttering birds.  |p306I  looked for a packet from Roget but there was none , and I became angry suddenly . Surely he would have written by now . I had to know what was going on in Paris ! Then I became afraid . " What the hell is happening in France ? " I murmured . " I 'll have to go and find other Europeans . The British , they always have information . They drag their damned Indian tea and their London Times with them wherever they go . " I was infuriated to see her standing there so still . It was as if something were happening in the room  --  that awful sense of tension and anticipation that I 'd known in the crypt before Armand told us his long tale . But nothing was happening , only that she was about to leave me forever . She was about to slip into time forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Damn it , " I said . " I expected a letter . " No servants . They had n't known when we would be back . I wanted to send someone to hire musicians . I had just fed , and I was warm and I told myself that I wanted to dance . She broke her stillness suddenly . She started to move in a rather deliberate way . With uncommon directness she went into the courtyard . I watched her kneel down by the pond . There she lifted two blocks of paving , and she took out a packet and brushed the sandy earth off it , and she brought it to me . Even before she brought it into the light I saw it was from Roget . This had come before we had ever gone up the Nile , and she had hidden it ! " But why did you do this ! " I said . I was in a fury . I snatched the package from her and put it down on the desk . I was staring at her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in the egotism of childhood had I hated her as I did now ! " Why did you hide this from me ! " I said . " Because I wanted one chance ! " she whispered . Her chin was trembling . Her lower lip quivered and I saw the blood tears . " But without this even , " she said , " you have made your choice . " I reached down and tore the packet apart . The letter slipped out of it , along with folded clippings from an English paper . I unraveled the letter , my hands shaking , and I started to read : Monsieur , As you must know by now , on July 14 , the mobs of Paris attacked the Bastille . The city is in chaos . There have been riots all over France . For months I have sought in vain to reach your people , to get them out of the country safely if I could . But on Monday last I received the word that the peasants and tenant farmers had risen against your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all who tried to defend the castle were slain before it was looted . Only your father escaped . Loyal servants managed to conceal him during the siege and later to get him to the coast . He is , on this very day , in the city of New Orleans in the former French colony of Louisiana . And he begs you to come to his aid . He is grief-stricken and among strangers . He begs for you to come . There was more . Apologies , assurances , particulars ... it ceased to make sense . I put the letter down on the desk . I stared at the wood and the pool of light made by the lamp . " Do n't go to him , " she said . Her voice was small and insignificant in the silence . But the silence was Ike an immense scream . " Do n't go to him , " she said again . The tears streaked her face likeclown paint , two long streams of red coming down from her eyes . " Get out , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " Get out , " I said . And again my voice did n't stop . It merelywent on until I said the words again with shattering violence : " GETOUT ! " I DREAMED a dream of family . We were all embracing one another . Even Gabrielle in a velvet gown was there . The castle was blacketled , all burnt up . The treasures I had deposited were melted or turned into ashes . It always comes back to ashes . But is the old quote actually ashes to ' idles or dust to dust ? Did n't matter . I had gone back and made them all into vampires , and there we were , the House de Lioncourt , white-faced beauties even to the bloodsucking baby that lay in the cradle and the mother who bent to give it tic wriggling long-tailed gray rat upon which it was to feed . We laughed and we kissed one another as we walked through the wiles , my white brothers , their white wives , the ghostly children chattering together about victims , my blind father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I CAN SEE ! " My oldest brother put his arm around me. 1 le looked marvelous inp308decent clothes . 1 'd never seen him look so good , and the vampiric blood had made him so spare and so spiritual in expression . " You know it 's a damn good thing you came when you did with all the Dark Gifts . " He laughed cheerfully . " The Dark Tricks , dear , the Dark Tricks , " said his wife . " Because if you had n't , " he continued , " why , we 'd all be dead ! " THE house was empty . The trunks had been sent on . The ship wouldleave Alexandria in two nights . Only a small valise remained with me . On shipboard the son of the Marquis must now and then change his clothes . And , of course , the violin . Gabrielle stood by the archway to the garden , slender , long-legged , beautifully angular in her white cotton garments , the hat on as always , her hair loose . Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grief was rising , a tide that included all the losses , the dead and the undead . But it went away and the sense of sinking returned , the sense of the dream in which we navigate with or without will . It struck me that her hair might have been described as a shower of gold , that all the old poetry makes sense when you look at one whom you have loved . Lovely the angles of her face , her implacable little mouth . " Tell me what you need of me , Mother , " I said quietly . Civilized this room . Desk . Lamp . Chair . All my brilliantly colored birds given away , probably for sale in the bazaar . Gray African parrots that live to be as old as men . Nicki had lived to be thirty . " Do you require money from me ? " Great beautiful flush to her face , eyes a flash of moving light  --  blue and violet . For a moment she looked human . We might as well have been standing in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire . Was she human then ? The brim of the hat covered her face completely for an instant as she bowed her head . Inexplicably she asked : " But where will you go ? " " To a little house in the rue Dumaine in the old French city of New Orleans , " I answered coldly , precisely . " And after he has died and is at rest , I have n't the slightest idea . "  | " You ca n't mean this , " she said . " I am booked on the next ship out of Alexandria , " I said . " I will go to Naples , then on to Barcelona . I will leave from Lisbon for the New World . " Her face seemed to narrow , her features to sharpen . Iler lips moved just a little but she did n't say anything . And then I saw the tears rising in her eyes , and I felt her emotion as if it were reaching out to touch me . I looked away , busied myself with something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still so they would n't tremble . I thought , I am glad Nicki took his hands with him into the fire , because if he had not , I would have to go back to Paris and get them before I could go on . " But you ca n't be going to him ! " she whispered . Him ? Oh . My father . " What does it matter ? I am going ! " I said . She moved her head just a little in a negative gesture . She came near to the desk . Her step was lighter than Armand 's . " Has any of our kind ever made such a crossing ? " she asked under her breath . " Not that I know of . In Rome they said no . " " Perhaps it ca n't be done , this crossing . " " It can be done . You know it can . " We had sailed the seas before in our cork-lined coffins . Pity the leviathan who troubles me . She came even nearer and looked down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be concealed anymore . Ravishing she was . Why had I ever dressed her in ball gowns or plumed hats or pearls ? " You know where to reach me , " I said , but the bitterness of my tone had no conviction to it . " The addresses of my banks in London and Rome . " Those banks have lived as long as vampires already . They will always be there . You know all this , you 've always known ... " " Stop , " she said under her breath . " Do n't say these things to me . " What a lie all this was , what a travesty . It was just the kind of exchange she had always detested , the kind of talk she could never make herself . In my wildest imaginings , I had never expected it to be like this  --  that I should say cold things , that she should cry . I thought I would bawl when she said she was going . I thought I would throw myself at her very feet . We looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinged with red , her mouth almost quivering . And then I lost my control . I rose and I went to her , and I gathered her small , delicate limbs in my arms . I determined not to let her go , no matter how she struggled . But she did n't struggle , and we both cried almost silently as if we could n't make ourselves stop . But she did n't yield to me . She did n't melt in my embrace.  |p310And  then she drew back . She stroked my hair with both her hands , and leant forward and kissed me on the lips , and then moved away lightly and soundlessly . " All right , then , my darling , " she said . I shook my head . Words and words and words unspoken . She had no use for them , and never had . In her slow , languid way , hips moving gracefully , she went to the door to the garden and looked up at the night sky before she looked back at me . " You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Frenchman who moved with the grace of an Arab through places in a hundred cities where only an alleycat could safely pass . " Of course , " I answered . But I was so broken in spirit now I did n't want to talk anymore . The colors dimmed . The night was neither hot nor cold . I wished she would just go , yet I was terrified of the moment when that would happen , when I could n't get her back . " Promise me you will never seek to end it , " she said , " without first being with me , without our coming together again . " For a moment I was too surprised to answer . Then I said : " I will never seek to end it . " I was almost scornful . " So you have my promise . It 's simple enough to give . But what about you giving a promise to me ? That you 'll let me know where you go from here , where I can reach you  --  that you wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stopped . There had been a note of urgency in my voice , of rising hysteria . I could n't imagine her writing a letter or posting it or doing any of the things that mortals habitually did . It was as if no common nature united us , or ever had . " I hope you 're right in your estimation of yqurself , " she said . " I do n't believe in anything , Mother , " I said . " You told Armand long ago that you believe you 'll find answers in the great jungles and forests ; that the stars will finally reveal a vast truth . But I do n't believe in anything . And that makes me stronger than you think . " " Then why am I so afraid for you ? " she asked . Her voice was little more than a gasp . I think I had to see her lips move in order to hear her . " You sense my loneliness , " I answered , " my bitterness at being shut out of life . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserve to be loved and yet I need love hungrily . My horror that I can never reveal myself to mortals . But these things do n't stop me , Mother . I 'm too strong for them to stop me . As you said yourself once , I am very good at being what I am . These things merely now and then make me suffer , that 's all . " " I love you , my son , " she said . I wanted to say something about her promising , about the agents in Rome , that she would write . I wanted to say .. .  | " Keep your promise , " she said . And quite suddenly I knew this was our last moment . I knew it and I could do nothing to change it . " Gabrielle ! " I whispered . But she was already gone . The room , the garden outside , the night itself , were silent and still . SOME time before dawn I opened my eyes . I was lying on the floor of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept . I knew I should start for Alexandria , that I should go as far as I could and then down into the sand when the sun rose . It would feel so good to sleep in the sandy earth . I also knew that the garden gate stood open . That all the doors were unlocked . But I could n't move . In a cold silent way I imagined myself looking throughout Cairo for her . Calling her , telling her to come back . It almost seemed for a moment that I had done it , that , thoroughly humiliated , I had run after her , and I had tried to tell her again about destiny : that I had been meant to lose her just as Nicki had been meant to lose his hands . Somehow we had to subvert the destiny . We had to triumph after all . Senseless that . And I had n't run after her . I 'd hunted and I had come back . She was miles from Cairo by now . And she was as lost from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally after a long time I turned my head . Crimson sky over the garden , crimson light sliding down the far roof . The sun coming  --  and the warmth coming and the awakening of a thousand tiny voices all through the tangled alleyways of Cairo , and a sound that seemed to come out of the sand and the trees and the patch of grass themselves . And very slowly , as I heard these things , as I saw the dazzle of the light moving on the roof , I realized that a mortal was near . He was standing in the open gate of the garden , peering at my still form within the empty house . A young fair-haired European in Arab robes , he was . Rather handsome . And by the early light he saw me , his fellow European lying on the tile floor in the abandoned house . I lay staring at him as he came into the deserted garden , the illuminationof the sky heating my eyes , the tender skin around them starting to burn . Like a ghost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robe . I knew that I had to run . I had to get far away immediately and hide myself from the coming sun . No chance now to go into the crypt beneath the floor . This mortal was in my lair . There was not time enough even to kill him and get rid of him , poor unlucky mortal.  |p312Yet  I did n't move . And he came nearer , the whole sky flickering behind him , so that his figure narrowed and became dark . " Monsieur ! " The solicitous whisper , like the woman years and years ago in Notre Dame who had tried to help me before I made a victim of her and her innocent child . " Monsieur , what is it ? May I be of help ? " Sunburnt face beneath the folds of the white headdress , golden eyebrowsglinting , eyes gray like my own . I knew I was climbing to my feet , but I did n't will myself to do it . I knew my lips were curling back from my teeth . And then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock on his face . " Look ! " I hissed , the fangs coming down over my lower lip . " Do you see ! " And rushing towards him , I grabbed his wrist and forced his open hand flat against my face . " Did you think 1 was human ? " I cried . And then 1 picked him up , holding him off his feet before me as he kicked and struggled uselessly . " Did you think I was your brother ? " I shouted . And his mouth opened with a dry rasping noise , and then he screamed . I hurled him up into the air and out over the garden , his body spinning round with arms and legs out before it vanished over the shimmering roof . The sky was blinding fire . I ran out of the garden gate and into the alleyway . I ran under tiny archways and through strange streets . I battered down gates and doorways , and hurled mortals out of my path . I bore through the very walls in front of me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shot out again into the packed mud alley and the stinking air . And the light came after me like something chasing me on foot . And when I found a burnt-out house with its lattices in ruins , I broke into it and went down into the garden soil , digging deeper and deeper and deeper until I could not move my arms or my hands any longer . I was hanging in coolness and in darkness . I was safe . I was dying . Or so I thought . I could n't count how many nights hadpassed . I had to rise and go to Alexandria . I had to get across thesea . But this meant moving , turning over in the earth , giving in to the thirst . I would n't give in.  |p313The  thirst came . The thirst went . It was the rack and the fire , and my brain thirsted as my heart thirsted , and my heart grew bigger and bigger , and louder and louder , and still I would n't give in . Maybe mortals above could hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spurts of flame against the darkness , heard their voices , babble of foreign tongue . But more often I saw only the darkness . Heard only the darkness . I was finally just the thirst lying in the earth , with red sleep and red dreams , and the slow knowledge that I was now too weak to push up through the soft sandy clods , too weak , conceivably , to turn the wheel again . That 's right . I could n't rise if I wanted to . I could n't move at all . I breathed . 1 went on . But not the way that mortals breathe . My heart sounded in my ears . Yet I did n't die . I just wasted . Like those tortured beings in the walls under les Innocents , deserted metaphors of the misery that is everywhere unseen , unrecorded , unacknowledged , unused . My hands were claws , and my flesh was shrunk to the bones , and my eyes bulged from the sockets . Interesting that we can go on like this forever , that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the luscious and fatal pleasure , we go on . Interesting that is , if each beat of the heart was n't such agony . And if I could stop thinking : Nicolas de Lenfent is gone . My brothers are gone . Pale taste of wine , sound of applause . " But do n't you think it 's good what we do when we are there , that we make people happy ? " " Good ? What are you talking about ? Good ? " " That it 's good , that it does some good , that there is good in it ! Dear God , even if there is no meaning in this world , surely there can still be goodness . It 's good to eat , to drink , to laugh . . . to be together . . . " Laughter . That insane music . That din , that dissonance , that never ending shrill articulation of the meaninglessness .. . Am I awake ? Am I asleep ? I am sure of one thing . I am a monster . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings move on through the narrow pass of life unmolested . Gabrielle may be in the jungles of Africa now . SOMETIME or other mortals came into the burnt-out house above , thieves hiding . Too much babble of foreign tongue . But all I had to do was sink deeper inside myself , withdraw even from the cool sand around me not to hear them . Am I really trapped ? Stink of blood above.  |p314Maybe  they are the last hope , these two camping in the neglected garden , that the blood will draw me upwards , that it will make me turn over and stretch out these hideous  --  they must be  --  claws . I will frighten them to death before I even drink . Shameful . I was always such a beautiful little devil , as the expression goes . Not now . Now and then , it seems , Nicki and I are engaged in our best conversations . " I am beyond all pain and sin , " he says to me . " But do you feel anything ? " I ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this , that you no longer feel ? " Not misery , not thirst , not ecstasy ? It is interesting to me in these moments that our concept of heaven is one of ecstasy . The joys of heaven . That our concept of hell is pain . The fires of hell . So we do n't think it very good not to feel anything , do we ? Can you give it up , l , estat ? Or is n't it true that you 'd rather fight the thirst with this hellish torment than die and feel nothing ? At least you have the desire for blood , hot and delicious and filling every particle of you  --  blood . How long are these mortals going to be here , above in my ruined garden ? One night , two nights ? I left the violin in the house where I lived . I have to get it , give it to some young mortal musicians , someone who will ... Blessed silence . Except for the playing of the violin . And Nicki 's white fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light , and the faces of the immortal marionettes , half entranced , half amused . One hundredyears ago , the people of Paris would have got him . He would n't have had to burn himself . Got me too maybe . But I doubt it . No , there never would have been any witches ' place for me . He lives on in my mind now . Pious mortal phrase . And what kind of life is that ? I do n't like living here myself ! What does it mean to live on in the mind of another ? Nothing , I think . You are n't really there , are you ? Cats in the garden . Stink of cat blood . Thank you , but I would rather suffer , rather dry up like a husk with teeth . THERE was a sound in the night . What was it like ? The giant bass drum beaten slowly in the street of my childhood village as the Italian players announced the little drama to be performed from the back of their painted wagon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets of the town during those precious days when I , the runaway boy , had been one of them . But it was stronger than that . The booming of a cannon echoing through valleys and mountain passes ? I felt it in my bones . I opened my eyes in the dark , and I knew it was drawing nearer . The rhythm of steps , it had , or was it the rhythm of a heart beating ? The world was filled with the sound . It was a great ominous din that drew closer and closer . And yet some part of me knew there was no real sound , nothing a mortal ear could hear , nothing that rattled the china on its shelf or the glass windows . Or made the cats streak to the top of the wall . Egypt lies in silence . Silence covers the desert on both sides of the mighty river . There is not even the bleat of sheep or the lowing of cattle . Or a woman crying somewhere . Yet it was deafening , this sound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth . I forced my fingers up towards the surface . Sightless , weightless , I was floating in the soil , and I could n't breathe suddenly , I could n't scream , and it seemed that if I could have screamed , I would have cried out so loud all the glass for miles about me would have been shattered . Crystal goblets would have been blown to bits , windows exploded . The sound was louder , nearer . I tried to roll over and to gain the air but I could n't . And it seemed then I saw the thing , the figure approaching . A glimmer of red in the dark . It was someone coming , this sound , some creature so powerful that even in the silence the trees and the flowers and the air itself did feel it . The dumb creatures of the earth did know . The vermin ran from it , the felines darting out of its path . Maybe this is death , I thought . Maybe by some sublime miracle it is alive , Death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no vampire , this thing , it is the very personification of the heavens . And we rise up and up into the stars with it . We go past the angels and the saints , past illumination itself and into the divine darkness , into the void , as we pass out of existence . In oblivion we are forgiven all things . The destruction of Nicki becomes a tiny pinpoint of vanishing light . The death of my brothers disintegrates into the great peace of the inevitable . I pushed at the soil . I kicked at it , but my hands and legs were too weak . I tasted the sandy mud in my mouth . I knew I had to rise , and the sound was telling me to rise.
