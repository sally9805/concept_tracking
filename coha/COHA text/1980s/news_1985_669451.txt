Things seemed bad for the Khmer Rouge and their noncommunist allies in the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea ( CGDK ) : They had already lost most of their bases on the Thai border . Despite this , the Chinese official says he found Pol Pot cheerful and optimistic. // ' ' I am not worried about losing our border bases , ' ' Pol Pot told his guest . ' ' Now I don ' t have to look two ways at once - I can concentrate on the interior . ' ' Khmer Rouge troops would now push deep inside Kampuchea ( Cambodia ) , cutting the highways and harassing the Vietnamese. // // Pol Pot is said to have repeated this line in another secret meeting several weeks ago . This time he reportedly met Thai deputy chief of staff , Gen. Chavalist Yongchaiyut , one of the main formulators of Thailand ' s Kampuchea policy. // The fact that Pol Pot openly represented the Khmer Rouge for the first time since 1979 is significant . His appearance reflects the level of concern of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move to try to reassure them that the CGDK can continue to mount an effective opposition to Vietnamese forces in Kampuchea. // The communist Khmer Rouge and the two noncommunist factions in the CGDK argue that the Vietnamese offensive was a blessing in disguise : It forced the Khmer Rouge from their defensive positions and obliged them to adopt guerrilla tactics. // Now the monsoon rains have begun and the coalition will have to transform its words into deeds. // The rainy season , which usually begins in May and lasts till October is held to favor guerrillas over conventionally-equipped troops . It is likely to be a time of intense activity both on the battlefield and in the diplomatic arena. // The three factions will be under pressure from their allies to prove their guerrilla skills quickly - preferably before the fall , when the United Nations considers Kampuchea ' s credentials . The CGDK is recognized by the UN as the legitimate government of Kampuchea , even though the Vietnamese-backed People ' s Republic of Kampuchea controls the country. // Meanwhile the coalition ' s allies , China , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brunei , Indonesia , Malaysia , Philippines , Singapore , and Thailand - and the United States , will be trying to shore up international support for the coalition. // All three factions claim to have started moving their fighters inside Kampuchea . The two noncommunist groups are said to have several thousand troops inside Kampuchea , most of them some 25 to 30 miles inside the northwestern border. // A sizable number of Khmer Rouge seem to have moved into the interior , Western analysts say . One large group is located west of the capital , Phnom Penh. // The Khmer Rouge say they are able to move large groups inside because Vietnamese troops are tied up along the Thai-Kampuchean border . A more likely reason is that they feel the need to prove to the Chinese , Thais , and others that they are still a major threat to the Vietnamese. // Fear of prohibitively high - and irreplaceable - casualties may have discouraged the Khmer Rouge from moving in before . This year they may be prepared to sacrifice their own troops to regain lost political ground. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backers of the noncommunist factions . The US and ASEAN want to see the Khmer Rouge role in the war decrease . Eventually they hope the noncommunists will become the dominant force in the coalition . This is still a long way off : The Khmer Rouge probably number 35 , 000 to 40 , 000 . The noncommunists together number less than 30 , 000. // By changing their tactics the Khmer Rouge are taking a big gamble : If they sustain heavy casualties , they will be hard pressed to find new recruits to take their place. // Peking and the Khmer Rouge themselves regularly claim that the guerrillas are able to raise large numbers of new military recruits . Recently , the Chinese said 10 , 000 Khmers had volunteered for the Khmer Rouge during the preceding year . This report seems highly unlikely . The Vietnamese meanwhile appear determined to seal the Thai-Kampuchean border as tightly as possible . Over the last year they have built a network of strategic roads , fences , and minefields along the border . Since the onset of the rains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontier . But they are apparently keeping a mixed force including Vietnamese and soldiers of their ally , the People ' s Republic of Kampuchea , along the border . Yet sealing the border will be a difficult and hazardous task. // The lack of serious Chinese retaliation against Vietnam during the dry season continues to worry CGDK allies and please Hanoi . The Vietnamese say Peking ' s preoccupation these days is economic development , not Kampuchea. // The Chinese admit their economy did influence their decision . ' ' Our first priority , ' ' one Chinese official said , ' ' is to retain our stability in order to continue development . And peace and development go togther. ' ' // But the Chinese add that this has not reduced their commitment to the CGDK . Peking will maintain a ' ' steady and adequate ' ' flow of military hardware , an official said . And , he said , a recent modification in Peking ' s conditions for normalization with Moscow did not mean any lessening of determination with regard to Kampuchea. // Before Peking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstacles have to be removed. // These are the military buildup along the Sino-Soviet border , the Soviet presence in Afghanistan , and Moscow ' s support for the Vietnamese presence in Kampuchea. // Recently the Chinese have begun to say that substantial progress on one of these issues would be enough to set off an improvement in relations. // ' ' But we think the easiest problem to resolve , ' ' a Chinese official said , ' ' is Kampuchea . ' ' The Soviets are the ' ' key element ' ' in the Kampuchea problem , said the official . ' ' The Vietnamese are stubborn , but if Moscow stopped providing military and economic aid , they could not continue their occupation of Kampuchea. ' ' // // // //
