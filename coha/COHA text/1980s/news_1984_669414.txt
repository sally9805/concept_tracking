A thoughtful look at what was commercially available 20 years ago brought a recognition that pervasive sex-role stereotyping of toys promoted passivity in girls and aggression in boys ; that there was precious little with which any child of color could identify positively. // The toy industry has changed in the intervening years - some would say for the better , others for the worse . What has not changed is that a good deal of thought and effort is needed in choosing toys that teach the values we want children to learn. // Toy shopping for school-age children is much more difficult than for preschoolers . Although it is possible to find nonsex-stereotyped , racially balanced , nonviolence-oriented toys for school-age children , they are comparatively scarce. // In wanting to choose toys that will please children , parents often face what feels like manipulation from toy manufacturers themselves . One reason for this is that when it comes to deciding what toys to make for older children , manufacturers see children , not parents , as the consumer group they aim first to woo and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressive changes in its preschool line , continues to market sex-specific toys for older children . ' ' Once children go to school , in order for us to stay in business we must satisfy the consumer demand for sex-specific toys , ' ' says Carol Blackley , manager of public relations at Fisher-Price. // Ms. Blackley ' s argument is echoed throughout the industry . Most companies still divide their school-age products into those sold to girls and those sold to boys , citing market research that shows each is a different consumer group with its own , usually traditional , sex-stereotypical preferences. // A good example is a robotics toy called a Transformer . Made by Hasbro Industries , Transformers are the hottest selling boys ' toy this Christmas . Dan Owen , Hasbro ' s vice-president for marketing , attributes the toy ' s phenomenal popularity in large part to the fact that it ' s based on a winner-loser model of behavior . ' ' It ' s aggressive and action-oriented , the thing boys are probably into most. ' ' // The sales history of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that parent and child consumers are not immune to the tenor of the times . These small dolls , depicting a paramilitary , antiterrorist force , were first introduced during the anti-Vietnam protests of the ' 60s . They did not do well . While Mr. Owen says that the toy ' s size and price are the reasons it was taken off the market , he is quick to say that today ' s political climate is why the recently reintroduced , scaled-down model is selling so well . ' ' Patriotism is pride in your country . That ' s stronger now than it ' s been in the last 15 years. ' ' // Not only must parents take into account that traditional sex stereotypes and the events in the larger society alter their school-age children ' s toy preferences , they must also contend with the effects of advertising . Even when limits are set on the amount of television viewing , the influence of TV ads sometimes seems overwhelming . One way to offset this influence is to think of the barrage of pre-Christmas advertising as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent consumers , suggests Suzanne West , family life development specialist and director of the nursery school in the New York State College of Human Ecology at Cornell University. // A place to start might be watching some ads with children and then talking together about why there are so many more toy ads right now , about the different kinds of activities these toys promote , and about the quality and durability of the toys ' designs . This gives an opportunity for children to explore how their own family ' s values compare with those of the society as represented by particular toy companies . Later , if a child is given a toy you ' ve both watched commercials for , evaluating whether the real thing is as good as it looked on TV can be a big step in learning to treat TV ads with healthy skepticism. // Another way to counteract the influence of advertising is to buy gifts in the shops associated with museums , aquariums , botanical gardens , and other noncommercial institutions your family has enjoyed visiting together . The toys , games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sexist , according to Geraldine L. Wilson , board member and writer for the Council on Interracial Books for Children . Remembering what particularly interested a child during a visit gives clues to what would be an appreciated gift. // Shopping for preschoolers is much easier , because they are less influenced by television and because the greatest industrywide changes have occurred in toys designed for younger children . Manufacturers clearly see parents as the consumers they must please. // Ms. Blackley , from Fisher-Price , cites product changes such as the expansion of the F-P soft doll line to include dolls that are male and female , black , white , and brown-skinned , with a range of hair colors , because of requests from both black and white consumers . Naming these dolls ' ' My Friend ' ' is in contrast to a language bias prevalent in the industry , where dolls made for girls are called dolls , while those made for boys are called action figures. // The Japanese-owned Tomy Corporation is another company that has responded to changing consumer preferences in toys for preschoolers. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dolls for little boys and computer-type toys for little girls reflects a change in role-modeling within their own families , ' ' says Mary Woodworth-Haglund , Tomy ' s public relations manager. // According to Ms. Woodworth-Haglund , parents have let the company know that they want both toy packaging and marketing to be representative of what actually happens in their own homes . Tomy has changed its preschool products accordingly. // Parental behavior not only affects the products toy companies offer preschoolers , but it is also a much stronger influence on the toy preferences of younger children . Parents should not underestimate the impact of their own behavior here , says Jennifer Birckmayer , a parent education specialist with New York State Cooperative Extension . Unless flexible roles are practiced at home , giving children toys generally associated with the opposite sex brings confusion , not expanded play options . ' ' Young children are more likely to do , or want to do , what they see the adults around them actually doing , regardless of what those adults may believe or say. ' ' // Ms. Birckmayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking out a toy is , ' ' Why am I choosing this toy ? ' ' If the answer fits both your own value system and your own behavior , then the toy is likely to be the right one for your child. // //
