The Philippine cargo ship Balsa 24 was plowing through the turbulent waters of the North Atlantic last week when it encountered a violent storm . Lashed by pelting rain and battered by 35-to-50-knot winds and 50-ft. waves , the vessel foundered 1,120 miles east of New York . Its 19-member crew frantically radioed an SOS , then clambered into a lifeboat . <P> Almost 15 hours passed before the first rescue ship  --  a Panamanian &; freighter , the Friasi  --  could reach the scene . It was followed by the Scamp , a nuclear-powered Navy submarine , which managed to pull one sailor to safety . Two more ships , including an Israeli vessel , converged on the area , but were unable to save any of the remaining crew . <P> The Friasi then spotted a sailor aboard a lifeboat and dropped a 30-ft. rope ladder . Drained of his strength after 22 hours in the howling storm , the crewman struggled slowly up the ladder . Only a few feet from safety , he was struck by a mountainous wave and lost in the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
