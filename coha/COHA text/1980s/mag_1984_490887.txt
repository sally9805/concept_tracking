THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment AYOUNG woman we know writes : According to a recent article in the nrnes , a San Francisco psychologist and two colleagues have determined that " the mechanics of facial muscle movement are closely tied to the autonomic nervous system , which controls heart rate , breathing , and other vital involuntary functions . " Other studies have shown that people tend to mimic the facial expressions  --  including smiles  --  of those around them . When I read these things , I was happy to get confirmation of a feeling I have often had ; namely , that we are all mixed up in one another , and that we murmur continuously to one another in a variety of subtle languages , changing one another 's blood pressure , sending heart rates up and down , affecting one another 's muscle tension and breathing . In some essential way , we are a-ways speaking the truth to one another and  --  on a physical level , at least  --  always understanding one another . The Times article also reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my freshman English class at a university situated on an arid plateau in the driest quadrant of the United States . The instructor , who was young and used big words , began explicating a poem , " A Simile for Her Smile , " by Richard ' Wilbur . I think that most of us were ignorant of poetry and its explication , having come from ranches with more livestock than people and from towns with small schools and even smaller libraries . I remember people scowling and busily writing down everything the instructor said , and occasionally taking anxious glances at the fragrant ditto sheets , with their blurred violet print , of the poem . The first stanza began : Your smiling , or the hope , the thought of it , Makes in my mind such pause and abrupt ease As when the highway bridgegates fall , Balking the hasty traffic ... After tearing that stanza apart and speaking rapidly about matters of assonance , alliteration , and internal rhyme , the instructor paused and asked if there were any questions . One sunburned kid asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructor was momentarily taken aback  --  maybe this was his first teaching job  --  and explained that poems did not necessarily have to rhyme at the end of each line . A long , tense silence followed while people took notes on this information . Then a young woman raised her hand . She was very interesting-looking , with glossy black hair , light-brown skin , and angular facial bones . I later learned that she was a Cherokee . The instructor called on her , and it took her a while to prepare to speak . Her lips were tight , her brow wrinkled . " I do n't understand the poem , " she said softly . " What do n't you understand ? " the instructor asked . " Well , I do n't get what bridgegates are , " the woman replied . The instructor , who must have come from the East , where such things perhaps existed , explained that bridgegates were on drawbridges , and that when the drawbridge on a river was raised to allow a boat to pass , the bridgegates fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the woman spoke solemnly and hesitantly . " Then the drawbridge kind of smiles when it 's raised ? " " That 's it ! " The instructor smacked his lectern . He grinned . " You understand the poem . " Pencils stopped moving . We all looked at the woman . And then a marvellous thing happened : she smiled , revealing even , white teeth . She had a beautiful smile . Everyone saw that . The forced , constricted mood of the classroom instantly vanished . We all understood something new , and smiled . ? Young Brains ON December 29 , 1827 , Michael Faraday , who has been called the greatest experimenter in the history of science , but who always referred to himself as a natural philosopher , confronted an auditorium full of children in the Royal Institution , in London . The occasion was the first in a series of talks to which Faraday had given the title " The Christmas Courses of Lectures Adapted to a juvenile Auditory , " and that talk dealt with the marvels of chemistry . Faraday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appreciation of the power and beauty of science from the proper sort of lecture . Fourteen years earlier , as a bookbinder 's apprentice with no formal education beyond elementary school , he had sat in the same theatre and beard Sir Humphry Davy discourse on his chemical researches . He had taken careful notes , bound them together , and sent them to Davy as a kind of introduction . The gesture had won him a job as Davy 's assistant . And in 1825 , with a number of important discoveries in physics and chemistry behind him , he had been named director of the laboratory of the Royal Institution . Among the responsibilities he undertook with great pleasure were the lectures . A memoir of the time described the enthusiasm of the young listeners who came up to Faraday afterward with questions : " Those who like it best come first , and they so crowd round the lecture table as to shut out the others . " In 1959 , Dr. Alfred E. Mirsky , a biochemist who was also the librarian of the Rockefeller University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lectures for young people in frank imitation of Faraday 's . When Dr. 14Iirsky died , in 1974- , the series was renamed in his honor , and an endowment to insure its continuation was provided by his widow , Sonya Wohl 11 , Iirsky . For the Rockefeller University community , the series is , as it has been from the start , very much a labor of love . Mrs. Mirsky , who has been the university librarian since 1977 , and Mrs. Gladys Lewis , who was Dr. Mirsky 's secretary for five years , handle all the paperwork , which this year involved correspondence with three hundred and sixty-eight public , private , and parochial schools in New York , New Jersey , Connecticut , and Pennsylvania . Outstanding students selected by their teachers attend the lectures , which are free and are held in Caspary Auditorium , on the university 's East River campus . The lecturers , who are chosen from the Rockefeller faculty by a committee of Rockefeller professors and administrators , have included Dr. Roger Payne , the man who discovered that humpback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Nobel Prize in 1972 for his studies of the molecular biology of the immune system . The title of the 1983 lecture series was " Brains . " The lecturer was Dr. Fernando Nottebohm , who was born in Buenos Aires in 1940 , and who directs the Rockefeller University 's Field Research Center for Ecology and Ethology , in Millbrook , New York . Some five hundred high-school students showed up on two afternoons during Christmas vacation to hear Dr. Nottebohm talk about the evolution and the neural basis of vocal learning in songbirds and the implications of research in this area for understanding human brains and behavior . Dr. Nottebohm made no effort to enliven his presentation with attention-getting demonstrations , as Michael Faraday often did . ( For one of his famous lectures on electromagnetism , Faraday set up a large electromagnet on the stage and threw everything but the kitchen sink at it to show his audience what would stick and what would n't . ) Dr. Nottebohm pulled no canaries  --  his favorite experimental animals  --  out of a hat . Instead , showing ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same slides he displays to professional audiences , he told the story of his lifetime of research , in a soft voice whose accent betrayed a hint of his South American childhood . He began by stating that only male canaries sing , and that each singing canary is capable of learning a new song every year . Then he told the students how , by delving into the brains of canaries , he and his colleagues discovered that singing in canaries is dominated by one side of the brain  --  the left  --  and that the areas in the male brain which control vocal behavior are larger than comparable areas in the female . Not only that but during the spring , when the male is learning his song for that year , his vocal-control areas are twice the size they were in the previous fall . Once the song has been mastered , these areas shrink back to their original dimensions . The seasonal swelling and shrinking are related to seasonal changes in the production of the male sex hormone testosterone . When Dr. Nottebohm injected adult females @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to increase in volume , and within ten days the females burst into song . One consequence of the songbird work , Dr. Nottebohm said , has been a renewed interest in " sexual dimorphism " in the brain anatomy of other species , including the human species . This was a hot topic in the nineteenth century , when eminent researchers claimed they had proved that women were intellectually inferior , because female brains , in general , were smaller than male brains . Once this " proof " was discredited  --  men , in general , have larger bodies and therefore larger brains , but over-all brain size does not correlate with intelligence  --  the belief took hold that men 's and women 's brains were virtually indistinguishable . There is an enormous overlap , Dr. Nottebohm agreed , but there may be some important differences as well . Recent studies indicate , for example , that while speech in most men is controlled predominantly by the left side of the brain the cerebral hemispheres in women are not so specialized . Addressing the young women in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Higgins ' query in " My Fair Lady "  --  " Why ca n't a woman be more like a man ? " ? may be found in the greater hemispheric specialization of the male brain , which makes males more vulnerable to brain injuries of all kinds . " Men , it seems , are particularly fragile organisms , deserving of your care and respect , " Dr. Nottebohm said . Another dogma of modern brain science which Dr. Nottebohm said has been challenged by work on songbirds is that by the end of infancy we have all the brain cells we will ever have , and that brain cells die in increasing numbers as we get older , and are never replaced . Using radioactive tracers , Dr. Nottebohm and his colleague Steven Goldman have demonstrated that adult canaries are constantly replacing old cells in the forebrain with new ones . Equating this process of neurogenesis with a kind of rejuvenation , Dr. Nottebohm speculated that its function might be to provide fresh brain space for new learning . Whether human brains have a similar capacity is not known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer this question within two years . An affirmative answer might open the door to new kinds of treatment for damaged brains and faulty memories . Periodically throughout his lectures , " They 're the Veterans of the Cabbage Patch Doll Wars . " which together occupied seven hours , Dr. Nottebohm reminded his listeners that they were free to interrupt at any time if they had trouble understanding him . He was interrupted only a few times in mid-lecture , but whenever he announced a formal break of a few minutes he was immediately surrounded at the lectern by students eager to learn more . Many of the questions had to do with the relationship between brain anatomy and the so-called higher mental functions , like consciousness . While warning of the dangers of drawing facile parallels between creatures as different as songbirds and people , Dr. Nottebohm encouraged his questioners to speculate about the " deep questions . " " These are things you should he concerned with , " he said . " I do n't have the answers . That 's what you young people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendance at the lectures were planning careers in research science . Jaclyn Jhin , a sixteen-year-old sophomore at Bayside High School , had been given a choice by her biology teacher . " Instead of writing a two-page biology report over the vacation , students could summarize Dr. Nottebohm 's lectures in note form , " Miss Jhin told us , " and I thought this would he easier . " Michael Nuzzo , a seventeen-year-old junior at Grover Cleveland High School , also in Queens , had come to learn about " the regeneration of brain cells " because his older brother John was partly paralyzed from a stroke he had suffered six years ago . But one of the students who pressed Dr. Nottebohm with questions after the last lecture was definitely planning a career in science ; she was Jeane Holland , a sixteen-year-old senior at Hunter College High School . She could hardly contain her excitement about the fact that neurogenesis occurs in the forebrain of the canary . " That 's where conscious control takes place , " she said . " Why ? Do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that neurogenesis stops ? .1 have so many questions , and if I do n't get the answers I 'll go nuts . " Boat Show OUR out-of-town sailing friend has sent us a report on the seventy-fourth National Boat Show , recently at the Coliseum : Change at the New York Boat Show comes slowly  --  or , at least , so it seemed to someone like me on being confronted by the familiar spectacle at the head of the escalators on the Coliseum 's second floor , where the largest boats are traditionally displayed , aisle upon glittering aisle . And , in fact , many of the boats that first met the eye were the same models that had been shown last year and , sometimes , the year before . Also , as with automobiles , " new " models , more often than not , bore a strikingly close resemblance to their predecessors , and so the experienced visitor 's overwhelming first impression was one of familiarity . Not that this was necessarily unpleasant ; seeing the phalanx of shiny Motor yachts and sport fishermen lined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of stability in a changing world , even if I had no instant compulsion to climb aboard . After a few minutes of wandering around the second floor , though , signs of a change in the exhibition 's pattern began to register . Compared with what I saw the last couple of years , when the show ( mirroring the industry it represents ) had a rather meagre air , this year 's exhibition was a self-assured affair , and the atmosphere of recovered expectations seemed to me to be most pronounced among the powerboats . Not that the largest boats on exhibit this year were as big as some that appeared a few years back ; it was the smallish family cruiser , rather than the high-rolling sybarite 's motor yacht , that was most in evidence . But I did have the feeling of a mild powerboat resurgence , and a corresponding deflation among the sailboat representatives . The absence of worries about fuel probably accounted for the slight sense of optimism ; the man who owns a power yacht of some size can look forward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the space of an afternoon , and he seldom considers time spent hunting for more fuel to be part of the advertised joys of boating . And , of course , the general upturn of the economy could account for some of the cheerfulness . It is part of the folklore of boating that a yachtsman will sell his wife before he will let the bank foreclose on his boat , but in hard times he is unlikely to make the annual or biennial investments in new vessels which keep the boating industry going . Year before last , it looked as if the Windsurfers and their competitors were going to take over the sailing world . This year , most of these sailing surfboards had been relegated to the show 's fourth floor , where they were clustered alongside the infiatables and were not a great distance from the perennial pitchmen  --  the hawkers of knives that never need sharpening and cleansers that clean everything . By contrast , electronic navigational devices appeared to have solidified their foothold . The prices of many such contrivances , like the prices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a new generation of wishful thinkers had appeared to patronize the whirring , clicking , and ( occasionally ) speaking dials that purport to tell you where you are with a precision that would have astonished Gerardus Mercator . On the second floor , I noticed one new vessel that may embody a trend . The boat is called the Lancer 27 Powersailer , and she represents an attempt to fuse the contemplative joys of sailboat cruising with the speed and range of a planing powerboat . According to an enthusiastic leaflet thrust into my hand by the salesman in attendance , the Powersailer will charge along at twenty miles an hour , propelled by a two-hundred-horsepower outboard motor , or , with that motor hydraulically retracted , will sail well enough to satisfy a sailing aficionado . Down below , the boat has the customary appurtenances of the small cruising yacht , power or sail : up forward , a V-shaped double berth that may also serve as a dinette ; a galley and a toilet compartment amidships ; and , tucked beneath the cockpit aft , a curtained-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enable boat owners to eat their cake and have it , too , and it does offer possibilities for the sailor too sunk in depravity to enjoy being becalmed and for the power-boatman so lost to decency as to want an hour or two of silent progress . Even so , the prospect boggles the orthodox mind : imagine , if you can , a yachting world in which those familiar terms of denigration " stink-potter " and " ragman " can not be flung back and forth . There will he nothing left to do but snarl at one 's loran  --  which , in the nature of things , will probably snarl right back . This may he progress , but it seems improper , somehow . Message ends . The Big House NO ! Calm down ! You , of Your Street , Your Town , U.S.A. , have not already won Your Fabulous Dream Mansion in Romantic Ireland . Definitely . For one thing , the drawing has n't been held yet . And , for another , you have to hand two hundred and seventy-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on horses to even have a chance . Barney Curley , whom we met last week over breakfast at the Berkshire Place Hotel , lives in a big house  --  Middleton Park in central Ireland . He desires to move . Instead of putting a sign in his front yard and an ad in the paper , Mr. Curley is raffling off the property . " All my life , I 've been different . I 've never gone through ordinary channels , " he said . A maximum of nine thousand tickets , each costing two hundred Irish pounds , or two hundred and seventy-five American dollars , will be issued to the public . Early in February , an Irish horse-race commentator named Michael O'Hehir , whom Mr. Curley described as being to Ireland what the Pope is to Italy , will reach into a hat and draw one of the tickets , and the owner of that ticket will win Middleton Park . " I play badminton in the halls with my children , " Mr. Curley said when he was asked to describe his property . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landlord families of Ireland . It started off with twenty thousand acres , peasant farmers , and the like , and it ends up today with three hundred and seventy-seven acres and rne . If you win it , you 're not winning the house and land alone . You 're also winning a bit of Irish history . Lawrence of Arabia galloped his ponies there when he was a lad . Sir Cecil Boy-d-Rochfort , the personal horse trainer to the English Royal Family , lived there . " Along with the pedigree come ten bedrooms , a gun room , two kitchens , a breakfast room , a dining room , a study , a library , a conservatory , a drawing room , a strong room , a reception hall , a wine cellar , forty-eight horse stalls , two foaling boxes , some stone-built piggeries and calf houses , two silage pits , a cattle shed , a tack room , and three two-car garages . Oh , and the separate lodge by the rear gate . " It 's very homey and comfortable , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it within a fortnight . " Born in a three-room house with a ? store in front , Mr. Curley was for a time a Jesuit novice . He began his involvement in public life by promoting Frankie McBride 's sorrowful tune " Five Little Fingers , " which , sure enough , became the first Irish single to make the British Top Twenty . He rose to prominence one fine June day in 1975 when Yellow Sam , a horse he owned , and had bet on with some gusto , went off at odds of twenty to one . Yellow Sam earned Mr. Curley six hundred thousand dollars that afternoon  --  money he immediately used to buy Middleton Park . " I wanted to put the money in something solid right away , " Mr. Curley said , adding that he lost a hundred and fifty thousand pounds betting on the Epsom Derby two years ago . Mr. Curley credits hard work , and not an ingenious system , for his turf triumphs . " One bit of advice , though , " he told us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a sure bet you 'll have another chance -- they 're unlikely to abandon racing tomorrow . " Middleton Park is on the block because Mr. Curley has decided to turn horse trainer , and the grounds of the estate , while not hilly , are too lumpy and uneven for running expensive horses . " I got the raffle idea in my head , and all my friends said I was absolutely mad  --  crackers  --  and that was enough to make me do it , " said Mr. Curley , who was in New York trying to sell raffle tickets to Americans . " I 'm not sure there 's ever been anything else that could give you back as much for as little . And Middleton Park ! What a house ! With the sun coming up , it 's something like ' Dallas , ' that thing on TV . The one with J.R . But it 's as if J.R . had racehorses . Yes , that 's it .
