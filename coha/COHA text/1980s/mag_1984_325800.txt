McMartin , three relatives and three other women faced charges that they sodomized , fondled and raped more than 100 preschool children at a day-care center run by McMartin in Manhattan Beach , a coastal suburb of Los Angeles . <P> To frighten their victims into silence , the teachers allegedly cut off the ears of rabbits and other small animals in front of the children , warning the youngsters that the same fate could befall them .

" We thought it was the best place for our children . "
