After nearly two decades of free-fall decline , are more traditional American values making a comeback ? According to a mid-decade report on American household characteristics issued last week by the U.S. Census Bureau , the signals are mixed . While some experts believe that families are stabilizing , the average household size continues to decline and the number of people living alone is up dramatically . <P> On the surface , at least , the census statistics continue to show a dramatic deterioration in orthodox marriages . Between 1970 and this year , the share of married couples among the nation 's 86.8 million households fell from 70.5% to 58% , replaced by an explosion of single people living alone . Some 20.6 million Americans now live by themselves , a 90% jump in one-person households over 15 years . Much of this is due to widowhood or divorce , as is the near doubling since 1970 of single people who head households . Single-parent families now account for 14.3% of U.S. households . <P> Younger people are staying single by postponing marriage . Couples are taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were just 15 years ago : the median marriage age is 23.3 years for women , highest in U.S. history , and 25.5 for men , just below the 26.1-years average at the turn of the century . High rents are also forcing young adults to remain at home . Among 18- to 24-year-olds , 62% of men and 47% of women still live with their parents  --  a mixed blessing that neither parents nor restive children may prefer . " Home is where the cheap eats are , " notes Census Bureau Demographer Steve Rawlings . " The nest is n't emptying as it once did . " <P> Some experts see such reversals as signs of a mini-revival of family life . The divorce rate , which doubled from 1950 to 1982 , has leveled off , though it still hits 1 of every 2 U.S. marriages . " People may be taking marriage more seriously , " suggests Barbara Wilson , a federal demographer . Similarly , the number of unmarried couples living together has stabilized . After soaring from 523,000 in 1970 to 1,988,000 last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's survey . Demographers attribute this mostly to economic and age factors . Said Author Bryant Robey : " It 's not a case of new morality . As the baby-boom generation gets older , it slows down the trend for unmarrieds living together . " <P> The social legacy of two decades of change will continue to show its effects , demographers say . The older median marriage age translates into fewer children and a diminished demand for schools . The decrease in household size  --  from an average 3.14 people in 1970 to 2.69 this year  --  has fueled a prolonged boom in apartment rentals , health clubs and upscale restaurants , and a corresponding , disturbing decline in the national savings rate . The single life is more expensive , notes Economist George Sternlieb of Rutgers University : " There 's nobody to share the telephone bill with . With no one to cook at home , singles eat out more . " Restaurants now pocket 40% of U.S. food expenditures.                  @ @ @
