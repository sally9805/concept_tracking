Tobacco industry officials have had little to cheer about of late , but they raised huzzahs last week  --  and watched the value of their corporate shares climb  --  in the wake of two important court cases . In Boston , a federal appeals court ruled that the Surgeon General 's warning labels on every package of U.S. cigarettes shielded Liggett &; Myers , based in Durham , N.C. , in a $3 million lawsuit filed by the heirs of a lung cancer victim . Just four days earlier in Atlanta , another appeals court had made a similar ruling in favor of American Brands of Old Greenwich , Conn. , the maker of , among other things , Pall Mall cigarettes . <P> , The Boston case concerned Joseph C. Palmer , of Newton , Mass. , who smoked L &; M cigarettes for 23 years . After he died of lung cancer in 1980 at age 64 , Palmer 's wife Ann and his mother jointly sued Liggett &; Myers , charging that the company had failed to provide adequate warnings about the dangers of cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company could be held liable under Massachusetts state laws ; that decision was overturned last week . <P> For its part , American Brands ( 1986 net sales : $8.5 billion ) was sued on grounds similar to those in the Palmer case by Verna Stephen , a Pensacola , Fla. , resident . Her husband Andrew died in 1984 of pulmonary heart disease and cancer at age 64 , after smoking Pall Malls for 54 years . Before the case could get under way , a U.S. district judge ruled on a pretrial motion that American Brands could argue that it is not liable under state consumer laws . On appeal , the Atlanta court upheld that ruling . <P> In both cases , the tobacco companies prevailed because the courts ruled that federal statutes held primacy over state laws . Specifically , the appeals courts declared that the federal disclosure law mandating cigarette package warnings , in effect since January 1966 , takes precedence over the state laws on which the product liability cases were based . The federal warning provides uniform labeling of cigarettes , the courts reasoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smokers against the economic benefits derived from domestic commerce in tobacco products . Said Judge John Brown for the first U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Palmer vs . Liggett &; Myers : " It is inconceivable that Congress intended to have that carefully wrought balance of national interests superseded by the views of a single state , perhaps of a single jury in a single state . " <P> Tobacco stocks surged after the decisions . On the day of the Boston ruling , American Brands climbed by 2 1/8 , to close at 56 5/8 . Shares of Philip Morris , the largest U.S. cigarette firm , which makes the Marlboro and Merit brands , rose 6 3/4 , to 119 7/8 . ( Shares of Liggett &; Myers are not publicly traded . ) The cases , however , may still be appealed to the Supreme Court . Meanwhile , a host of similar cases are hanging fire ; Liggett &; Myers alone is the target of about 30 .
