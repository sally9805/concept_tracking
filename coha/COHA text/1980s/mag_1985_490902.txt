THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment BOUT ten weeks have passed since the disastrous accident at the chemical plant in Bhopal , India , and we 're now beginning to get the exhaustive journalistic reconstructions  --  the Times completed its series a few days back . They provide one of the ways that all of us manage to cope with the horror , to domesticate its wrenching impact , to try to heal over the tear in the world we otherwise take for granted , the world we need to take for granted : This happened and then this , this other thing had been overlooked a few days earlier , no one had even considered the possibility of that , and then , by some awful coincidence , this , and then , and then  --  and so it all came to pass . Terrible , yes , but at least accounted for . The Times ' reconstruction of the Bhopal incident as it was seen from the point of view of the workers at the plant  --  this was the second installment in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than usually familiar . Reading it , all of us must have experienced that uncanny shiver of an almost exact d  --  j ? vu : a large containment vessel holding an inconceivably toxic material ; a routine , ongoing maintenance program involving the cleaning and repair of certain pipes at the periphery of the central vessel ; seemingly inconsequential problems with an unsecured valve ; water leaking in where it was n't supposed to ; a. change of shifts , the late-night/earlymorning crew coming on ; the staff turning out to be undereducated , uninformed of risks , untrained in emergency procedures ; inadequate instrumentation in the central control room , so that technicians could n't monitor crucial developments within the containment system ; a history of breakdown and unreliable performance of whatever instruments there were , so that technicians at first discounted the import of such gauge-readings as they were managing to get ; a sudden buildup of pressures and temperatures inside the vessel ; a tremendous noise ; panic ; the lethal gas steaming out . This was Three Mile Island all over again . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mile Island , we readers of that second installment found ourselves empathizing , identifying with the workers on the scene , trying to imagine what it must have been like for them during the minutes when the disaster was building : that vertiginous sense of growing helplessness as the threats leaped exponentially upward , right to the moment when possible response was approaching zero and the mortal consequences infinity  --  the men under too much pressure , the vessel under too much pressure , the containment structures bursting open , and death pouring out . It had almost happened at Three Mile Island ; it did happen at Bhopal . The terrible , almost mesmerizing fascination that these near and actual disasters hold for us can not he diminished by a mere tallying of the potential casualties or the actual casualties , horrifying though the statistics may be . ( Over two thousand people died at Bhopal  --  that is the figure most frequently quoted these days . But we 're only just beginning to absorb the fact that there were some two hundred thousand lesser injuries . ) What truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers as the spectacle of suddenly vanishing competence , of men utterly routed by technology , of fail-safe systems failing with a logic as inexorable as it was once indeed , right up until that very moment  --  unforeseeable . And the spectacle haunts us because it seems to carry allegorical import , like the whispery omen of a hovering future . Those photographs of the intricate control panels at Three Mile Island , of the seemingly identical panels at Bhopal : we stare at their images in the Times and then right through them , to the master control panels of our contemporary fantasies , the controlling control panels just beyond the reaches of our everyday routines and considerations  --  the control panels of NORAD , of the Strategic Air Command , of the war rooms in the Pentagon and in the Kremlin . Those images , too , we 've all but memorized : the dials , the blinking lights , the gauges and the graphs , the men hived round the walls of computers , staring expertly into monitoring screens , gazing competently up at incandescent maps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we try to assure ourselves . The men in the fantasy unceasingly act out the pantomime of calm , all-knowing authority . The machines hum submissively  --  completely tame . The system is as fail-safe as fail-safe can be . But among the vapors that seeped out at Bhopal ten weeks ago one of the most pervasive and most corrosive was the reminder that no systems designed and built and operated by human beings can ever he totally fail-safe . That reminder hangs like a pall over the world today , but soon , like any vapor , like every such vapor before , it will begin to dissipate , Let us hope , though , that this time , before the vapor lifts , the world 's citizens will awaken , and that , awakened , forewarned , they will hurry to act to rid the earth of the menace that the giant control panels do not  --  can not  --  control . iirchitect of the Capitol IN Washington , the United States Capitol is in the middle of a facelift , and the other morning George White explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , " he told us when we sought him out in his office , in the Capitol basement . " We 're binding the building , so the bricks and masonry that hold it up wo n't thrust out and the walls wo n't slowly collapse . " Mr. White is an interesting-looking man ( white muttonchops , thin bow tie , cat's-eye ring on left little finger ) who , as Architect of the Capitol , is paid to worry about this sort of thing . " Architect of the Capitol is to some degree a misnomer , because this office has a lot of responsibilities , " Mr. White went on . " We operate the Capitol power plant , and supply all the heating and cooling for government buildings in the area known as Capitol Hill . We direct the United States Botanic Garden , which is a museum of plants that began with the bounty from an expedition back in 1842 . The Capitol grounds come under us  --  the gardeners , the tree surgeons all work for this office . We also do all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management . Then , there are the projects that actually benefit from having an architect in this role . This office is in charge of all the construction that takes place on the Hill , and it 's responsible for the design of any new buildings and for any changes to the buildings already up . For small projects , we have a modest design staff . For large ones , we go outside . Whatever gets dune , I 'm the architect of record . " Between 1865 and 1971 , the year Mr. White was appointed , the Architects of the Capitol were not architects . The last architect to hold Mr. White 's position was Thomas Walter , who resigned toward the end of the Civil War , after the completion of the present Capitol dome . " The building was looking pretty silly with that little low dome on there once they added those two new wings , for the House and Senate , so Walter designed a new dome , " Mr. White said . Walter 's portrait hangs in the Architect 's office , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cirinal designer of the Capitol and , in 1793 , was appointed its first Architect . Three shiny shovels , each used at a Capitol Hill groundbreaking , perch above the mantel . A wailful of diplomas announces Mr. White 's degrees  --  in engineering ( M.I.T. ) , business ( Harvard ) , and law ( Case Western Reserve ) ? and his licenses to practice architecture . " It 's just one of those extraordinary things , " Mr. White observed , sitting in front of his certificates . " I have the kind of background that fits this job . In 1970 , the White House was looking for a new Architect , and I said I was n't interested . I did n't know what the jab was , but to me at the time the government was somebody down in the post office throwing a letter in the wrong mailbag . I was practicing architecture in Cleveland , and the last thing I wanted to do was move to Washington to work for the government . They asked me again the next year , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something I wanted to try . From the end of the Civil War to the turn of the century , the job had been more like Superintendent of the Capitol . But there had been a good deal of building on the Hill during this century , and things were long past the point where the country could play **25;7149;TOOLONG in making judgments about where buildings should go , and some other game to decide what they ought to look like . " The big jobs that Mr. White has overseen are a new building for the Library of Congress and a new Senate office building , but most of the projects he likes to show off are inside the Capitol . He escorted us to the doorway of the Old Supreme Court Chamber , not far from his office , saying , " When I came here , this was a storage room . " Now the room is small and dark , with brass lamps , gleaming mahogany benches , and marble busts giving it a dignified air . Arches make a half-dome ceiling in the shape of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that the Court met here from 1810 to 1859 , " he said . " When the new wing for the Senate was completed , the Court moved upstairs into the Old Senate Chamber , leaving this one to become the law library . After the Court moved across the street to its own building , fifty years ago , the library moved with it , and this room was partitioned for offices . Then it filled up with furniture and papers and junk , and it looked like hell . I said , We 've got to do something about this . ' " The Architect unclipped a cord harrier and led us into the well of the courtroom . " The busts of the five Chief Justices we moved here from upstairs . The carpet design we obtained from a painting of the third , and greatest , Chief , John Marshall . You 'll notice that the light in here is pretty dim . We thought there must have been a chandelier , but we stripped the plaster off , and dug through the history books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lots of evidence of complaints by lawyers that they could n't see well enough when they came to argue before the Court . " Upstairs , Mr. White glanced at a chandelier whose glass drops sparkled . Moving right along , he remarked , " That one 's tough to keep clean . " In a huge room ringed with full-size statues of men and women from every state , he said , " Statuary Hall . This used to be the House Chamber before the new wing was finished , in the late eighteen-fifties , and we 've restored it the way it appears in a painting done by Samuel Morse four decades earlier . He never really made it as a painter , and that 's why he moved on to invent the telegraph , but he was a fantastic draftsman . " A family of tourists was startled by the zest of Mr. ' White 's delivery . " That 's why we got so many details right in this restoration , " he finished . The Architect walked over to the base of a sturdy bronze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harrison Beadle , and said , " When I came along , this room was a chamber of horrors . I decided I would move things around . When this statue landed here , right at the entrance , people asked , ' Who 's he ? What happened to Daniel Webster and the other greats ? ' Even though I think Beadle measures up  --  he saved millions of acres of school land from speculators  --  I took the position that this was n't a political matter . You 'll notice that the shortest statues are near the entrance and the tallest are across the room , with the marble ones in front of the columns and the bronze in between . The public does n't necessarily notice , but it gets a feeling of order . " As we peered into a hall known as the Speaker 's Lobby , Mr. White told us , " This place looked like a third-rate bus station . There were spittoons everywhere . We cleaned it up , and there was a lot of grumbling . Now if we tried to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run us out on a rail . " The Architect ushered us down a wide corridor . Gazing out a window at the Washington Monument in a distant mist and then at some scaffolding next to the Capitol , he said , " This is what I wanted to show you . We 're drilling holes from the external walls back through the inside walls , and some of the holes are twenty-seven feet long . Then we 're putting in stainless-steel rods . Once we 're done , the building will he stronger than ever . " Sight on U.S. Highway I WHEN the Port Chester , New York , Life Savers plant closed down last March , after sixty-four years of turning out the familiar candies named for their resemblance to life preservers , that Westchester village lost its assortment of candy fragrances for good . Ray Sammarco , a former manager of the Port Chester plant , who retired in 1982 after forty-five years there , told us , " If the air was a little damp , the aromas would cling close to the ground , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right down Main Street . Particularly the rum and butterscotch and peppermint . Cinnamon was another one . Those were our strongest flavors , and the aroma of one or another of them told the people on Main Street right away which flavor of Life Savers we were concentrating on that day . " The candy factory that had been responsible for such olfactory pleasures since 1920 occupied an attractive five-story sea-green-and-white building , and this has now been sold by Life Savers ' parent company , Nabisco Brands , to a Connecticut developer , who plans to convert it into condominiums . The work that used to be done there has been shifted to a one-story Life Savers plant in Holland , Michigan , which is " newer , more efficient , and more modern , " according to a Life Savers spokesman . What was primarily accountable for the plant 's shutdown , it seems , was the ever-growing tendency of Americans to keep their distance from sugar . The declining domestic sales of hard sugar candy also prompted Life Savers to begin manufacturing such sugarless candies as Sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printing on every roll of Life Savers " Loss THAN 10 CALORIES PER PtEcE " in the spot where until only a few years ago one had always found " THE CANDY WITH THE HOLE . " All of which leads us to what will be the next thing lost by the residents of Port Chester , and by everyone travelling U.S. Highway I through Port Chester , and by everyone riding on the west side of the Metro-North or Amtrak trains as they round the bend in front of the old Life Savers plant : the sight of five enormous metal replicas of rolls of Life Savers which have decorated the base of the building 's facade for many years . Recently , we travelled up to Port Chester for a closer look at these landmarks . The rolls are large ( each about seventeen feet long and four feet in diameter ) , but part of what makes them so awesome is the comparative size of the real thing ( about two and three-quarters inches long and three-quarters of an inch in diameter ) . Each of the five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by long brackets at either end . These out-of-sight arms hold them so far out from the wall that the rolls appear to be floating horizontally along the front of the building . Each is tilted slightly forward and down , and features one plastic Life Saver candy just starting to tumble out the lowered end . Shiny , crumpled metal sheeting around it adds a realistic peeled-away-foil effect . The Life Savers labels are perfect enlargements of the real things , except that their slogans still play up the hole , and not the calories per piece . As you face the plant , the flavors represented are , from left to right , Wild Cherry , Five Flavor ( this assortment , incidentally , was packed into field-ration kits during the Second World War ) , Pep0Mint , Orange , and Wint0- Green . Ray Sammarco told us that the plastic Life Savers falling out of the packages have fluorescent lamps inside them and are still being lit at night . He also described to us a typical scene outside the plant : " People vacationing or touring would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out on the grass and take pictures of each other beside the Life Savers . Or they would FEBRUARY 18 , 1985 take a youngster and sit him right inside one of the front Life Savers and take his picture . Or have him pretending to lick the Life Saver . " " It 's amazing the amount of publicity they 've had over the years , " Tony Gatti told us by phone from his office at Nabisco headquarters , in Parsippany , New Jersey . Mr. Gatti is director of manufacturing services for Life Savers . " When we first announced the closing of the plant , almost the first question was ' What 's going to happen to the big Life Savers ? ' Well , we 've had our engineering department do some cost estimates for removal of those rolls and their transferral to other locations and reinstallation there . We 're looking at the possibility of sending our two most popular flavors , our Five Flavor and the PepOMint , out to Holland , Michigan , where they 're still being made . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our plant in Puerto Rico . And what we might do , if it 's feasible , is to change the logo on one of the remaining ones to a Sugar Free Breath Savers logo . It could then be transferred to our plant in Canajoharie , New York , where we manufacture Breath Savers , which are made on the same equipment as Life Savers and have the same configuration . The fifth , we 're hoping , can be donated to the Village of Port Chester . It would n't stay at the building . The town would probably put it in a park . " " We have a fantastic park here where it can go , " Port Chester 's Mayor , Peter Iasillo , told us when we inquired . " It 's called Lyons Park , and we 've just built a gazebo there , and we have a firemen 's memorial and a Vietnam veterans ' memorial , and it would make a very nice setting for the Life Savers . " As we were leaving the Life Savers replicas and Port Chester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was strolling down the sidewalk in front of the old plant . He was Joe Ferretti , twenty-nine years old , and he 'd lived in Port Chester all his life , he told us . " It 's always been kind of neat to drive by these things , " he said . " I remember when I was four or five I wanted to  --  I do n't know  --  put one in my bedroom . " Then , pointing toward Main Street , he said , " They might still have the postcards with all the giant Life Savers at the stationer 's . " We checked there , but they did n't have any left . And none were available at three other likely spots , either . When , at our fifth THE NEW YORKER. stop , a drugstore , we finally did find the postcards , we bought a bunch . Jackson Communique . l . ' PS been unseasonably , and unrea-sonably , cold in the Deep South , and on hearing the other morning that Jackson , Mississippi , was all but paralyzed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most eminent residents , Eudora Welty , to inquire how she and her neighbors were faring . When she answered , her voice , to our relief , sounded quite cheerful , and she gave us the following report : " My telephone 's one of the few things that are working around here . I 'm one of the real lucky ones . My electricity stayed on , so I 'm all right , but , what with transformer fuses blowing out and trees falling down , many people have had no light or heat for three or four days , and they 've been moving in with more fortunate friends or going to hotels . One of my neighbors has been making coffee over her hearth fire . We 're pretty much iced in in Jackson . Nothing is moving . It 's just impossible to get around . There 's a heavy coating of ice on everything . " You know , when I was growing up here we only had snow two or three times until I went to college , but now we seem to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the cold spell has been so prolonged . Usually , after a snowstorm it warms up again in a day or two , but I have n't been out of the house in five days . And we 're due for more sleet this afternoon . Last time I checked the temperature , it was two above . Jackson is not inexperienced when it comes to bad weather , We 've had our share of floods and tornadoes . We have a pretty good mayor  --  Dale Danks . Is n't that a nice name ! He 's taken us through other emergencies , like the flood of ' 79 . First thing he did this time was to close up everything . No schools , only a few businesses open . I do n't even know if he can get up in his plane to look at things , because the airport is shut down , and so are most of the roads . The Mayor has been warning people not to go out in their cars , because if the car stalls or they have an accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Our interstate highways are closed stem to stern . The TV news this morning said there were many wrecks on the roads , but nobody knows about casualties , because the wrecks have only been spotted by planes . When the postman came by a couple of hours ago , he told me he 's been skidding all over town , because he 's supposed to deliver by vehicle , not on foot , and they do n't usually issue tire chains for mail trucks south of the Mason-Dixon Line . The few people who have four-wheel drive have been volunteering to take other people to shelters . " One friend of mine trying to come home by plane got as far as Atlanta , and then flew to New Orleans , and finally made it here by Amtrak . She said the train was full of people heading toward Jackson from all directions . Apparently , they had a big party en route . The children are having a grand time , too , with no school . They 've been coasting on cardboard boxes and plastic bowls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his front door for the children to slide on . The town 's not very hilly , but the least slope is treacherous . If we have this sort of weather again next year , I suppose all the children will be getting real sleds . When I was a child and the snow fell , my mother always rushed to the kitchen and made snow ice cream and divinity fudge  --  egg whites , sugar , and pecans , mostly . It was all a lark then . I always associate divinity fudge with snowstorms . " Some people have been going out  --  the joggers , of course , among them  --  but their dogs wo n't . My friend Charlotte 's dog finally did go out , and brought her back a frozen mouse . I do n't have any pets , because I travel so much  --  thank goodness , I have nowhere to go this week  --  but at a time like this I 'd like to have a little creature in the house with me . There are birds in the yard , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I 've enough food in the refrigerator , and I 've been getting some writing done . But you feel somehow as if you were isolated on a ship . The funniest thing , in a way , is that a lot of Jackson people were planning to go to Colorado to ski , and now they ca n't get to the snow because of snow . "
