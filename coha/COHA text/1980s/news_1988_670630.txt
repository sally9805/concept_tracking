He looked up to see a hideous beast with the body of a bear and the face of a man towering over him . Terrified , he looked for a weapon and then blurted out , " In the name of Jesus . " The words , repeated several times , were enough to vanquish the creature , which finally fell down " twitching in pain like a wounded snake. " // " It was the beginning of being taught the power in the name of Jesus , " Mr. Swaggart wrote in his 1984 autobiography . " Unknowingly , I was also combating an evil spirit . In the years to come , I knew I would have to master these lessons - for they could mean the difference between life and death. " // Mr. Swaggart ' s battle with evil now threatens perhaps the most popular television ministry in the nation and the $141 million empire he has built around it . <> <> Tensions in Electronic Church // The turmoil in his ministry in this year of wild upheaval in television evangelism may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threaten to transform the billion-dollar world of the electronic church. // In the last decade a select few preachers , many of them the most theatrical products of the dirt-poor , circuit-riding tradition of Pentecostal evangelism , have been thrust into positions of extraordinary power and wealth . To some experts , the Spirit-filled passions that brought men like Mr. Swaggart or Jim Bakker to the top are the very things that could spell their downfall in a competitive world in which too many preachers may be chasing too few dollars. // " Most of these guys come from poor unsophisticated backgrounds of Pentecostal preaching , and there ' s nothing in their background that prepares them for the positions of power they ' re thrust into , " said David Harrell , a history professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who has written about the evangelical movement. // " In some ways , " he said , " the characteristics that make them successful are the ones that make them most vulnerable . While a lot of them have the gifts that get them there , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // Mr. Swaggart , who last year scornfully mocked the indiscretions of other evangelists like Mr. Bakker , last Sunday tearfully confessed to sins that apparently included encounters with prostitutes along Airline Highway outside New Orleans . <> <> Sin and Redemption // Mr. Swaggart ' s church elders , the Louisiana Presbytery of the Assemblies of God , recommended suspending him from preaching for three months as well as a two-year rehabilitation . But , implying that the punishment was not stringent enough , the national church ' s Executive Presbytery has asked that the decision be reviewed. // Mr. Swaggart has called himself " an old-fashioned , Holy Ghost-filled , shouting , weeping , soul-winning , gospel-preaching preacher . " But that description does not come close to capturing his power . He turns each service into an epic exploration of sin and redemption , roaring the gospel in a rough bayou bark and singing it in a smoky baritone. // " I don ' t know of anyone in America , religious or secular , who can hold a crowd better , " said William Martin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement . " I have a friend who is a criminal lawyer and who ' s Jewish who says he listens to Swaggart all the time . He says , ' I don ' t believe a word he says , but I don ' t know anyone in the world who ' s better with a closing argument. ' " // Mr. Swaggart has been perhaps the most visible symbol of the enormous growth in Pentecostalism . The movement has been the fastest-growing segment of religion in America for the last decade because of its ecstatic , theatrical tenor and emphasis on powerful personal experience through " gifts of the Spirit " like faith healing and speaking in tongues . <> <> Performer as Well as Preacher // Mr. Swaggart , who took in about $60 million in 1982 , raised $141. 6 million in 1986 . The Assemblies of God has about 2. 3 million members in 11 , 000 churches , and the total number of Pentecostalists numbers about 10 million . Mr. Swaggart has estimated that there are about 30 million adherents to various Spirit-filled Christian faiths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Mr. Swaggart , a performer as much as a preacher , who combines an apocalyptic backwoods preaching style and an international evangelical empire , has always symbolized the tensions and contradictions in the movement. // He grew up in the hardscrabble backwoods of Ferriday , La. , in the Depression , son of a poor fisherman , trapper , sometime bootlegger and eventual Pentecostal minister who was also an accomplished fiddler . Mr. Swaggart ' s interests turned toward the ministry at an early age. // " Jimmy to us was like Jesus walking on the face of the earth again , " said his cousin Mickey Gilley , the Houston-based country music star . <> <> Battle of Good and Evil // Mr. Swaggart ' s religion is a world in which Satan is as palpable as Jesus is , in which good and evil are always fighting for supremecy . As a boy he did not have to look far for similar conflicts in his own life. // His closest friend , and alter ego , was his first cousin Jerry Lee Lewis . In his autobiography , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were twins . " They learned to play piano from the same black blues musician , and the two would often play together on the same piano , Jimmy playing bass and Jerry Lee treble. // As they grew up , their lives diverged . Jerry Lee became a rock-and-roll star whose life has been a series of tragic marriages and bleary bouts with the bottle . Jimmy dropped out of high school and married at the age of 17 . He preached his first sermon , on the streets of Mangham , La. , while still a teen-ager. // Still , the gospel that young Mr. Swaggart played and " the devil ' s music " that young Mr. Lewis played were similar musically and had nearly identical effects on audiences . But for the performers , there was a difference : Mr. Swaggart had to channel into chaste , godly pursuits the ecstatic energies that his cousin could play out . <> <> ' Satan Used That ' // If Mr. Swaggart worked constantly to save Mr. Lewis ' s soul , the rock-and-roll star had a pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Satan used that quite a bit , " said the Rev. W. L. Swaggart , Mr. Swaggart ' s father. // Almost from the start , Mr. Lewis was a phenomenal success . For Mr. Swaggart the road was a lot longer . He spent years traveling across dusty rural roads in a broken-down car that regularly needed what he considered small miracles to keep going. // In his autobiography , " To Cross a River , " he said he once healed the ancient Plymouth of sticking valves so he could get to a revival meeting , pouring " oil from a little bottle I carried in my pocket to anoint the sick " on the hood ornament . The car , he wrote , thereafter purred " like a new Singer sewing machine . " When it finally died , Mr. Lewis bought him a new Oldsmobile so he could keep his ministerial career alive. // Mr. Swaggart developed great success on the revival circuit , making listeners feel the joys of Jesus as well as the heat of Hell , and his gospel recordings sold extremely well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Camp Meeting Hour " to radio . By 1973 , he had turned to television , eventually building a home base in Baton Rouge , La. , that now employs 1 , 500 people . It includes a 7 , 500-seat family worship center , a Teleproduction Center where programs are produced , edited and translated into 13 languages for airing in 145 nations , and the Jimmy Swaggart Bible College . <> <> ' He Was Not a Humble Man ' // But at the time of his greatest success , he was apparently frequenting the seedy neon dives and rent-by-the-hour motels where a private investigator took the photographs that led to his confession last weekend . Prostitutes have told reporters they saw him often , sometimes wearing hats and sunglasses or combing his hair forward in disguise . Church officials have said his sexual encounters were pornographic in nature but did not involve intercourse . Despite numerous rumors , it was not clear what sexual conduct Mr. Swaggart engaged in. // If his lapses seemed shocking to his followers , there were some in the evangelical world who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It appeared to me that Jimmy Swaggart emphasized himself greatly as opposed to God , " said a member of another evangelical camp . " When you met him you knew he was not a humble man . Pride goes before a fall , and he ' s a classic example. " // Even admirers saw his plight as one of the battles in the constant war between Jesus and Satan. // " The whole world is on his shoulders , preaching to half a billion people every week , " Mr. Swaggart ' s father said . " You ' re not knowing from one day to the next if you ' re going to have the money . And Satan is there to tell him during the night , ' You ' re not going to get it . ' There ' s a strain there . There ' s a load . No human being can stand it. " // " Satan uses God ' s people , sad to say , to attack God ' s people , " he added . <> <> ' The Kings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stunning series of changes in television evangelism . Until recently Pat Robertson , Mr. Bakker and Mr. Swaggart were the three leading charismatic television ministers. // Mr. Robertson has left television to run for President . Mr. Bakker ' s empire was toppled by sexual and financial scandals last year . Mr. Swaggart ' s is now in doubt . Some observers feel Mr. Swaggart ' s abilities are so great and his support so fervent he might be able to overcome his current problems . His confession , as opposed to the extended soap opera that accompanied Mr. Bakker ' s fall , should help him regain some credibility , experts say. // Still , to some in the evangelical world , the disarray and declining fortunes of preachers still on the air , like Oral Roberts simply mean opportunity for new aspirants. // " When somebody loses a lot of money , somebody made a lot , " said the Rev. Jim Whittington , pastor of the Fountain of Life Church in Greenville , N.C. " All the kings have fallen . There ' s more room now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> <> ' Back to Local Churches ' // Others add that televised evangelism has many constituencies and that the problems of a fire-breathing Pentecostalist like Mr. Swaggart need not greatly affect the less emotional ministries of preachers like Robert Schuller or Jerry Falwell. // But most experts think the scandals will end the huge growth in the following of television preachers . " This will probably direct some attention back to the local churches and away from the TV ministers , " said Dr. Harrell of the University of Alabama . " I don ' t think you can kill the electronic church , but there ' s just no way to say it ' s not wounded. " // To some experts , the setbacks have a dour logic to them . They note that the glut of big-name preachers has made frantic fund-raising , like Oral Roberts ' statement a year ago that God would " call him home " if he did not reach his fund-raising goal , more a part of the evangelical picture . And , like the stock market in early October , television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bubble waiting to burst. // " If this is still a bull market for television evangelists , this is one hell of a correction , " said Jeffrey K. Hadden of the University of Virginia , co-author of " Prime Time Preachers. " //
