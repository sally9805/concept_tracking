He was 8 points ahead of Tan Liangde of China , which was about where you would expect Greg Louganis to be after eight dives in the springboard preliminaries . This is something like saying the sun was where you expected it to be at noon . Next up was a moderately difficult reverse somersault that he was accustomed to nailing for 8s and 9s , but this time it went wrong . He jumped almost straight up instead of up and out , spun too close to the board , cracked his head on the board 's edge as he rotated backward , and wobbled raggedly into the water . It was the melodrama of the Seoul competition 's opening week , and the message of this first act was " He 's human after all . " The second act , soon to come , seemed to prove what many had thought all along : " No , he 's not . " <P> There was plenty of drama in another tank a couple of subway stops away as swimming began to churn , but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a delightful geography lesson . <P> True , the powerful East German women 's team won three of the first four golds and did not stop there . Cheeky , frail-looking Janet Evans of the U.S. , a 17-year-old whose nonexistent muscle mass offers no visible means of propulsion , easily took the fourth gold in the 400-meter individual medley , as form said she would . She went on to shock East Germany 's imposing Heike Friedrich , accelerating astonishingly in the last 50 meters of the 400 freestyle , to break her own world record by 1.6 sec. with a 4:03.85 . But the first four women 's silvers went to two Chinese , a Costa Rican and a Rumanian , while a French gamine named Catherine Plewinski was a tick away with a bronze in the 100 free . The once-every-four-years fan wonders , When did all these people learn to swim ? <P> Among the men , Tamas Darnyi of Hungary broke his own world record in the 400 individual medley , with Dave Wharton of the U.S. a solid second . Britain 's Adrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . Big Matt Biondi finally won his first gold by anchoring the U.S. 4 X 200-meter freestyle relay team to a world-record win in the best race of the week , roaring up from behind to beat Steffen Zesner of East Germany with the fastest 200-meter leg ever swum , as teammates Troy Dalbey , Matt Cetlinski and Doug Gjertsen bayed to the rafters at poolside . But before that , he finished third . in the 200-meter freestyle , behind Australian Duncan Armstrong and Swede Anders Holmertz , and then was just touched out ( and so thoroughly flummoxed that he was muttering shoulda-coulda three days later ) in the 100-meter butterfly , 53.00 to 53.01 , by a gent listed as " Anthony Nesty , SUR . " <P> Shouts were heard : " What 's SUR ? " " Suriname , " someone answered , " northeast South America . " Nesty , who trains at the University of Florida , was the first citizen of this former Dutch colony to win an Olympic medal . Biondi , leading at 98 meters , was caught awkwardly between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to glide to the wall . " I was afraid if I took another stroke , what would touch first would be my nose , " he explained gloomily . But Nesty , who won the same race in the Pan American Games last year , belonged on the Olympic victory stand , and so did a surprising number of athletes from countries whose representatives used to disappear in the prelims . What happened long ago in track was now evident in swimming : world beaters were bobbing up from all over the world .
