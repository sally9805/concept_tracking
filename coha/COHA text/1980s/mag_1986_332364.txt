Only seven times in the past 16 years has TIME stepped back from its responsibility to the reader for a comprehensive presentation of the week 's news to devote the bulk of an issue to a single special subject . This is such an occasion , an unabashed ( mostly ) , eclectic and breezy celebration in stories and illustrations of what America does best , either in the view of Americans or as perceived by the rest of the world . The difference in perspective can be quite startling ; see , for example , People . <P> This issue is our contribution to the very special Fourth of July the nation will celebrate next month , a birthday present to the Statue of Liberty as she turns 100 . Like most stimulating journalism , it will , the editors expect and indeed hope , spark some spirited disagreements about our choices and our omissions . For example , in Books we talk about that distinctive American contribution to detective fiction , the hard-boiled hero . Some will rightly miss a piece about the remarkable and varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but another time . <P> Inevitably , too , some will think that America 's worst  --  poverty , homelessness , prejudice  --  makes offensive an enterprise that so accentuates the positive . We have tried in our stories to point out that much remains to be done for the U.S. to fulfill its promise to all its citizens , and to avoid what Senior Writer Lance Morrow in this issue calls the " manic habit " Americans have " of thinking they are either the best of peoples or the worst of peoples . " <P> The idea for the issue came from Washington Correspondent Barrett Seaman , as the editors last winter began seeking an original contribution to the predictable clutter of statue memorabilia that would accompany the centennial festivities . Correspondents in the U.S. and abroad joined the staff in New York in suggesting , winnowing and eventually reporting the stories . Says ! Senior Editor Christopher Porterfield , the smiling fellow pictured with a flag in his breast pocket , who was in charge of the issue : " We wanted a celebration , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of humor about our foibles . " He adds , " This very undertaking is characteristically American . It is the journalistic equivalent of an old- fashioned holiday parade . We 're strutting a bit and having moments of reflection and exhorting ourselves to do better as well . " <P> The American Best issue is a story told not only in words but in pictures and graphics that create a narrative of their own . Says Special Projects Art Director Tom Bentkowski , who not only supervised the interior art but designed the cover : " This was a challenge ; there was no set of events that we had to explain , like a volcano erupting or an election . Here we were required to craft the pictures and the design to make larger points . "
