Books and the Arts looks to me like Charles Curtis , then the vice president of the US . On one page we 're told that Cimarron " had cost nearly $1.5 million , but it grossed only $1.38 million . " Five pages later we 're told that " RKO 's biggest success , both commercially and artistically , was Cim Dental O. Selzniar 's Hollywood is a pleasant urprise . Its folio size , its fold-out title page , its copper-sheeted and peephole part-pages make it look like the ultimately inflated offspring of all the lush film books of the last 15 years It 's so heavily illustrated-1,500 photographs , 450 of them in color ? that the double-columned text seems only a layout afterthought to separate the pictures . The idea obviously was to do a lavish production about a lavish producer ; but to start to read the book , even to look caref ully at the well-integrated pictures , is to detect real substance , which keeps getting stronger . Like to many of Selz-nick 's films , this book about him is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $75 until December 31 ; 885 thereafter . ) The author , Ronald Haver , director of film programs at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art , spent 12 years scouring archives and interviewing survivors of the Selznick years , some of whom no longer survive . Thomas Ingalls , the book 's designer who gets billing on the title-page , must have been working on it an inordinately long time , too . It ca n't be called a beautiful book : some of the color photos ? Ingrid Bergman and Rhonda Fleming , for instances ? are harsh . But its lavishness , even its garishness , are part of its being : and the any photos , a lot of which are new to me , Grew a concurrent text , supporting and supported by the written text . ( One of my favorite shots : D. W. Griffith , aged 70 and finished , on the set of Duel in the Sun to visit two people ? Lillian Gish and Lionel Barrymorewhom he had launched in films 33 years earlier . ) Haver tells us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 145 times . Aside from making us wonder when he had time to research and write the book , the fact is another dank portent that the book has to , and does , over come . He says in his first line that he has n't written a biography of Selznick or a critique of the films but a history of the career , and so far as that distinction can be maintained , it 's true . I could have wished for even less critical comment ? it 's not Haver 's strength ? and for more biography . For example , Selznick got into films because his father had gone into them ; but his father 's transition from jeweler to film producer is only sketched , apocryphally , which seems a bit offhand for a matter so important to the subject 's life . Still , the book , text and pictures , is a developed piece of work . Before I get into what it develops , some reservations . The quality of the writing fluctuates like a seismograph in turbulence . Much of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it is cobbled , and occasionally it 's painful . " These were the men who built the industry ; they had their eye upon the whole and not just the doughnut . " ) Some of the opinions are shaky . All major films before Duel in the Sun , Haver says , especially those that approached its costs , " had served up the tried-and-true virtues of the time , telling stories that left no doubt in the viewer 's mind as to just who and what was right and wrong . " How about ? to name only the one of which the end of Duel reminds me ? Creed ? I spotted only a few errors . In a photo of a story conference for All Quiet on the Western Front , Maxwell Anderson is misidentified as George Abbott . In a photo of the 193011931 Oscar ceremonies , the man called Max See , an art director Now for the good news , which , like the book , is plentiful . Text and pictures spill out the story of aman born at exactly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have happened if some great figures ? say , Sergei Eisen-stein or Max Reinhardt ? had been born 25 years earlier or later . Selznick is not in that league , but the very aptness of his date of birth helped him , too , to fertility and fulfillment . He was born in 1902 , just as the film business was being launched , was ( virtually ) born into that business , and came of age just as Hollywood was exploding . The whole dearly hugged American mythology of Hollywood corruption , of selling out , had absolutely no meaning or inhibition for him . He was in love with films as soon as he was old enough to know it , and was in love with the way they were and could logically grow : he had no ambition to do anything but the same things , better . He was a markedly intelligent and energetic boy who , at the age of 19 , went after school every afternoon to work in his father 's New York office and who wrote capsule comments on films and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nick and college . In 1923 the father 's business collapsed , and Selznick began to scrounge around the film world in New York . He had some ambition to be a writer , but his brother Myron , who became a top agent , was already in California and urged him to come out In 192b he made the move . He went to work , for a two-week trial period , as a reader in the MGM story department . At the end of the trial he was made manager of the story department , seven months later he was assistant to a top producer . Clearly the fish was in the water . The career snowballed , through sev : eral studios and back to MGM where , since he had meanwhile married Louis B. Mayer 's daughter , he felt a particular need to prove himself . He soon shed the " son-inka w " bel . His fiat MGM production was Dinar nt Eight , a smash ; his fifth was Vivo Villa ! which marked the end of his first year there , was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Coupes/SUL another Oscar nominee and a huge success . The Dick- ens film was the first of a string that he produced at MOM and later at his own studio derived from books that he had adored as a boy and youth ? Anna Karen ? a , A Tale of Tam Cilies , Lillle Lord leyntleroy , The Brnorm of Zeta , The Adventure , of Tan Honor ) Almost all of them were successful . and those made from great books reflected the high-level commercial producer who makes changes for commerce with solemn respect . ) Ben Hecht , who worked on some screenplays for him , once sent him a telegram : " The trouble with you David , is that you did all your reading before you were twelve . " Selznick 's complete filmography which includes A Bill of Dironsneul , King Sacred , the first ( and best ) A Mar is Born , and three Hitchcocks , Rehrcoh Spellbound , and The Parmins Car ? is staggering in terms of success and of filmgoers ' pleasure . And all this without even mentioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that film is of course the longest , and the details of the history , a quite different subject from one 's opinion of the film itself , make one gape at Selznick 's vigor and command . ( Haver omits one sidelight . The search for a Scarlett O'Hara was so widely publicized and went on so long that Clare Boothe wrote a satirical play about it , Plin the Boys Goodbye , which was produced on Broadway , then filmed . ) The most impressive aspect of the book is that it 's the portrait of a man who , through most of his life , was happy . Happy , despite a thousand daily used and irritations . because he was being used up in the work he wanted to do and for which he was completely qualified . His mind and taste were precisely congruent with the upper end of the Hollywood spectrum no whatever the daily abrasions , there was no basic abrasion : there was snugness , completion . It showed in the way he operated , the Napoleonic confidence in large matters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tam Cilia was in production , Selznick Insisted that one dose-up of Ronald Colman be lighted only with candles ? So years before Stanley Kubrick " invented " the effect in Rua Lys3 ? III . When Victor Fleming broke down From overwork on 1.1A'TW , Selznick had another director on tap , Sam Wood , to cover Fleming 's two-week rest . ( Selznick. working equally hard , did not break down . ) And he also could make sure that Gregory Peck was shaving three times a day while Spellbound was shooting , because of the star 's heavy beard , and could fret , during the production of Shire You Went Away , about Claudette Colbert 's time off for menstrual pain . Inevitably he made his mistakes . He willingly allowed Charles Laugh ton to withdraw from Micawber after three or four days ' shooting ; I 'm a W. C. Fields not but that Yankee twang in Dickens has always jarred . And Selz-nick would n't go ahead on Stagnach , with John Ford directing , unless Gary Cooper and Marlene Dietrich played the lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selzniek 's defense it might be said that he never eared much for Westerns anyway . ) There were more mistakes . But most of the major ones cluster toward the end of his career after his wife left him in 1045 . The inferable reason for the split was Jennifer Jones . The inferable reason for the change in his career , of which Haver does n't make much , is that Irene Selznick had been a sound and needed adviser . True , Selma was now no longer young in a business that he always said belonged to the young , but he was n't 70 , he was 43 . True , Hollywood was about to move out of its old production modes , but the change was only beginning . There seems no reason to doubt that he lost strength when his wife went . And , because his life and the success of his work were so tightly linked , our feeling of fundamental happiness in him begins to dim . The only memorable picture with which he was subsequently associated was The Third Man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although he is listed as co-producer with Alexander Korda . The most notorious of this last group was Duel in the Sun , which is an almost too pat case of anear-meno- pausal man trying to demonstrate sexthe picture for Jennifer Jones . ) He strove so hard to get raunchiness into it that footage had to be deleted at the request of the Hays office and the Legion of Decency , which was far from typical of Selznick 's films . Two more points . If you have thought that the frenzy level of day-to-day filmmaking work must be high , this book will turn up the dial further . How Selznick knew where he was at any moment , how he knew he wanted to revise this page of script or that hair- style or lighting , are tributes to a secret gyroscope ? a gyroscope spun by the power of the happiness that was in him for so long ? which separated each hectic day into multiple discrete moments of clarity . ( And while he was working on one film , he was also planning others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . ) And there 's a central matter , one I 've noted before . The persona and function of the producer have been badly skimped in all the writing about Hollywood . The auteur theory concentrates on directors and often treats producers as the grains of sand for pearl-making directors . Even where that was true , the strong producers left an imprint on films as vivid as the directors ' . Hitchcock , working for Selznick or anyone else , was sui generis ; but most of the others , John Cromwell , George Cukor , William Wellman . William Dieterle , worked under Selznick . In filmmaking whose only real reason for being is profit , I ca n't see why the man with the surest sense of profitable filmmaking should not be in charge . This book is not the story of a great individual artist but of a preeminent subscriber to a system . The title is not Hollywood 's David 0 . Sehniek . His directors ' styles and methods were not interchangeable , but their pictures for Selznick are Selznick pictures . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resign from A Farewell to Arms , Selznick told a reporter , " In Mr. Huston , I asked for a first violinist and instead got a conductor . " That says it all . Haver gets a bit carried away in his peroration . Even one who looks as dourly as I do at most contemporary US film ca n't agree that Selznick 's " commitment to excellence and the standards of quality . are sadly lacking today " Every year there are dozens of US films with high production standards : that 's not our trouble . And Haver 's statement about Selznick 's " concern for the integrity and intelligence of the audience " is a rather free translation of Selznick 's often-expressed concern to please the audience . Stilt , in its look , its care , its enthusiasm and fascinating detail , this is the best book about the old Hollywood since Kevin Brownlow 's The Parade 's Gone By ( which came from the same publisher ) .                  @ @ @
