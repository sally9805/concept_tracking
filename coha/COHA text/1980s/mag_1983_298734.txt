Can U.P.I.-the Avis of wire services-keep its motor running ? <P> The bulletin from Manila scored a clear beat for United Press International : Correspondent Max Vanzi , who was on the scene , was thus able to report 3 hours ahead of his Associated Press rivals , who depended on government spokesmen , that Philippine Politician Benigno Aquino had been shot down moments after returning from exile . Yet when the declarative U.P.I , report and a hedged , uncertain A.P . bulletin came over the wire to the Washington Post shortly after 2 a.m. two weeks ago , editors decided to play it safe and put into their final edition a story saying only that Aquino had been arrested on arrival . Without their own reporter present , Post editors were just not ready to rely on any wire-service account . <P> The Post 's reaction underscored the dilemma of the Avis of wire services : U.P.I , can not outstrip the dominant A.P . except by showing enterprise on stories ; yet when it does , clients chafe that its ambitions may lead to carelessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it made no difference " that the assertive report came from U.P.I , rather than A.P . Still , quite a few news executives share the judgment of William Greer , associate news editor of the Miami Herald : " U.P.I , has had a reputation for shooting from the hip . " Adds Greer : " They have done a good job the past couple of years overcoming that . " <P> Even so , if the past few years have been mortally difficult for second papers-only 29 cities still have fully independent , competing dailies-they have been almost as perilous for the second wire service . U.P.I. 's longtime owners , the Scripps and Hearst newspaper chains , were anxious to sell ; they were absorbing annual losses of up to $7.7 million . At times it seemed that newspapers kept buying U.P.I , just to maintain a competitor for A.P . ( which draws 1,299 of the 1,704 U.S. dailies , vs. 629 for U.P.I. ) . Says Executive Editor David Lawrence of the Detroit Free Press : " We felt that if A.P . were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to become a little arrogant . " <P> Securing a buyer for U.P.I , was not easy . The owners offered it first to a consortium of U.S. newspapers , next to the British-based Reuters news agency , then to National Public Radio , before finding controversial new proprietors in June 1982 . Buyers Douglas Ruhe and William Geissler had minimal experience in journalism , but plenty in political activism : Ruhe , 39 , was twice arrested for civil rights protests in the 1960s , while Geissler , 37 , spent almost a year in federal prison for refusing to be drafted during the Viet Nam War . Both had been publicists for the little-known Bah'i faith , a Unitarian religion , founded 120 years ago in what is now Iraq , that claims 3 million followers . Furthermore , the two Nashville businessmen admittedly had little wealth , but refused to discuss the financing of their purchase of U.P.I. Insisted Ruhe at the time : " No one is behind us . " As an unintended admission of unpopularity , that statement was uncomfortably true : their home-town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
