COVER STORIES <P> Forty years later , a military gamble that shaped history is recalled <P> " From this day to the ending of the world <P> ... we in it shall be remembered , - <P> ... we band of brothers ; <P> For he today that sheds his blood with me <P> Shall be my brother . " <P> - King Henry V <P> The wind howled in the darkness as they went to the meeting . It was just before 4 a.m. on June 5,1944 , and the rain slashed at them " in horizontal streaks , " Dwight Eisenhower recalled later . The commanders of Operation Overlord were gathering around the fireplace in the library of Southwick House , outside Portsmouth , to hear a Scottish group captain named J.M. Stagg predict the next day 's weather . On the basis of Stagg 's calculations , Eisenhower would have to decide whether to give the attack order to the nearly 3 million troops assembled in southern Britain for the greatest seaborne invasion in history , the assault on Hitler 's Atlantic Wall . <P> Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would strike on June 5 , and Eisenhower had reluctantly ordered a 24-hour postponement of Dday . The first troopships , already at sea , had to be called back . But now that the storm was actually upon them , Stagg offered what he called " a gleam of hope for you , sir . " The next day , June 6 , there would be some clearing of the skies , a break of perhaps 36 hours , no more . The cloud ceiling over the Normandy beaches would be about 3,000 feet , the waves only about three feet high . <P> The risks were tremendous .

" I ... sat silently reviewing these things , maybe , I 'd say , 35 or 45 seconds ... " said Eisenhower , who had reviewed these same things many times before . " I just got up and said , ' O.K. , we 'll go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tide in the affairs of men , which , taken at the flood , leads on to fortune . Until Eisenhower made his decision , and until the highly uncertain outcome of D-day was assured , it was still theoretically possible that Hitler might yet win the war , or at least achieve a stalemate that would leave him the master of most of Europe . <P> The Allies had regained a great deal since the darkest days of 1941 and early 1942 , when the Germans ' panzer divisions swept to within 40 miles of Moscow and their Japanese allies struck at Pearl Harbor , the Philippines , Malaya . The hitherto invincible Japanese navy had been checked at the Battle of Midway in June 1942 , the Soviets held fast at Stalingrad , and the Anglo-American invasion of North Africa that autumn inspired Churchill to say that although victory there might not be the beginning of the end , it was perhaps " the end of the beginning . " <P> Now , two years later , the Soviets had smashed all the way to the Polish frontier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome ; fleets of Allied bombers were steadily pulverizing all the major cities of Germany . But Hitler 's battle-hardened force of 7 million men still dominated an empire extending 1,300 miles from the Atlantic to the Dnieper , and his scientists were on the verge of unsheathing their promised victory weapons , the long-range V-1 buzz bomb and
