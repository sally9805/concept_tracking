A senior military officer said admiringly : " Strong staff , weak committee . " A veteran Congressional official differed , saying : " The staffers just run roughshod over the members . " Either way , there is widespread agreement that members of the committee ' s professional staff have more influence on military budgets , weapons and research and development than do members of the committee itself . That makes them among the most influential people in Washington in determining the military posture of the United States. // // ' High Priests ' of Legislation // " The members of that staff are the high priests of the legislative process , " a critic said . It is a mark of the Armed Services staff members ' influence that plenty of people in Washington were willing to talk about them , but no one , even admirers , was willing to be quoted. // The power of the Armed Services committee ' s staff was not always thus , by any means . Until 1975 , the committee , members and staff alike , was dominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mendel Rivers and F. Edward Hebert , all now deceased . But the post-Watergate Congressional revolution of 1975 , when entrenched Demcratic committee chairman were overthrown , ended that succession. // Mr. Hebert was replaced by Melvin Price , an Illinois Democrat . A gentle and soft-spoken man , now 77 years old , he is considered to be courteous and fair to the other committee members . But many feel , as does a longtime lobbyist , that the staff director , John J. Ford , " is the de facto chairman of the committee. " // Mr. Ford denies that he is the de facto chairman and says that many people do not realize that " Mr. Price is a very good politician , and he knows how to handle pressure. " // " When Mr. Price wants to say no , " Mr. Ford said , " I ' m the one who says no . " <> <> Longer ' Corporate Memory ' // Members of the committee staff are powerful for several reasons . They are older and more experienced than the young men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and then leave . And military officers serve in the Pentagon for three years , then move on . " Our corporate memory is better than theirs , " Mr. Ford said of the military aides. // At the age of 55 , Mr. Ford has been on the staff since 1965 . William H. Hogan Jr. , the general counsel , is 66 and a retired Navy captain . William D. Price , 72 , spent 30 years in the military and retired from the Air Force as a major general . Seymour Shwiller , 63 , is a retired Army colonel , Edward J. Bauser , 62 , a retired Navy captain , and Alan C. Chase , 45 , a recently retired Air Force colonel. // The committee staff includes younger people whom Mr. Ford says he has brought in to prevent " block obsolescence . " Robert M. Emmerichs , 35 , spent 10 years in the Air Force , meanwhile earning a master ' s degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in aerospace engineering . Thomas E. Cooper , 39 , has a master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member who draws the most comment is Anthony R. Battista , 44 , a specialist in mathematics , aerospace matters and naval weapons . He is considered brilliant by some , arrogant by others and perhaps the most influential staff member by nearly everyone . <> <> ' Better Have Him Aboard ' // " I don ' t think you can underestimate the influence of Tony Battista , " a lobbyist said . " If you want your weapons program , you ' d better have him aboard . " A defense contractor said : " If he ' s against you , you ' re in trouble . He will fight a bear with a buggy whip. " // Mr. Battista works primarily for the Subcommittee on Research and Development , which decides which weapons programs will be started . With his expertise and self-assurance , another Congressional staff aide said , " Tony Battista blows the members away 9 times out of 10. " // Mr. Battista was on vacation and unavailable for comment . Mr. Ford said of him : " Tony is influential and he tends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he is no more influential than any other key staffer. " // Formerly , the committee had only legislative oversight , while the Appropriations Committee voted military funds . Today , having persuaded Congress to give it more power , the Armed Services Committee must authorize most expenditures before an appropriation can be approved. // The staff has grown with its power . Under Mr. Vinson , there were only three professional staff members . Under Mr. Rivers , there were seven , and under Mr. Hebert , 16 . Today there are 30 , plus an equal number of administrative and clerical workers . <> <> Reams of Classifed Papers // In Washington , it is axiomatic that information is power . The professional staff of Armed Services has taken that to heart , Congressional staff aides say . The staff receives reams of highly classified and technical documents from the Department of Defense , from defense contractors and from research organizations. // But the staff is vigilant in controlling access to those documents . Members of a Congressman ' s staff , even with proper clearances , usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their busy bosses . The Congressman himself can look at them only under carefully monitored circumstances , and that is sometimes at the last minute , just before a bill is to be marked up. // Much of the committee ' s work in hearings , debate and preparing legislation goes on behind closed doors . Because only members of the committee and the committee staff are permitted in the room , a Congressman can not bring in a specialist on his personal staff to advise him. // The committee staff may be more cohesive than most because , unlike most staffs on Capitol Hill , it is not divided into majority and minority sections , on the theory that national defense should be nonpartisan . " If the staff was politicized , it would not have so much power , " a defense contractor said . " It would have power only with the majority Democrats . " <> <> Coming Spending Conference // Congressional aides who relish a political fight are eagerly anticipating the House-Senate conference that will be called later this year to reconcile differences between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fiscal year starting October 1. // Much of the bargaining will be done by staff specialists . While the Senate Armed Services staff is considered bright and able , it is younger and less experienced ; the Republicans gained control of the Senate only 18 months ago. // " The House staff will chew up the Senate , " a House official said . But a longtime lobbyist said that Senator John Tower , the Texas Republican who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , would balance things out . " He ' ll put on golf shoes and stomp and kick , " the lobbyist said. //
