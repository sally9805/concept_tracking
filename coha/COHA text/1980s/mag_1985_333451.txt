RV <P> As narrative , Nineteen Eighty-Four is simple to the point of banality . Complexities of plot and psychology are , as George Orwell understood , inimical to the cautionary tale . He deliberately cast his main characters  --  Winston Smith and his lover Julia , the doomed spiritual and sexual revolutionaries opposing the Stalinesque exactions of Oceania  --  as archetypes of the ordinary . They are a modern Everyman and Everywoman pitilessly propelled forward into a future that seemed all too possible in 1949 , when the novel was published . The recent passing of Orwell 's prophetic date has not rendered their lives or their fates much less plausible . <P> What Orwell could not foresee was that his novel would become perhaps the most pervasive fiction of the nuclear age . Any would-be movie adapter of Nineteen Eighty-Four knows that a work so well and easily remembered requires revision if the film is to evoke a response beyond the merely respectful . In these circumstances , the achievement of Michael Radford and his actors is subtle and brave . <P> John Hurt , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last stages of consumption ; repellent in his grayness and enervation , Hurt is oddly compelling too . As Julia , Suzanna Hamilton plays her harshly lighted love scenes with a nakedness , both physical and emotional , that is astonishing in its neediness . By making the romance more explicit , Radford gives it a pathos and a symbolic weight that are , if anything , more affecting than in the novel . Finally , the late Richard Burton as O'Brien , the couple 's betrayer and interrogator , gives a last performance that is all silky corruption , perfumed malice in every beautifully measured phrase . <P> For this second screen version of Nineteen Eighty-Four ( the first appeared in 1956 ) , the man who has done the most to intensify Orwell 's vision is Production Designer Allan Cameron . He has remained faithful to the futurology of Orwell 's day , avoiding reference to technologies that have evolved since the novel was written . Typically the omnipresent telescreens project Big Brother 's propaganda in black and white , never color , and their shape is that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one has ever heard of the microchip . The height of sophisticated communication is represented by the pneumatic tube and the dial phone . And when O'Brien tortures Winston into submissiveness to the state , his instruments are the old-fashioned table with leather straps and electroshock . All of this matches perfectly the external world through which Winston and Julia stumble : it looks like a vast , bombed- out housing development . Cameron thus carefully upsets our common visual assumptions about things to come . With antiseptic cliches banished , we are forced to confront a basic truth : the will to tyrannize is utterly independent of technology . It is present in every time , place and setting . And it will abide .
