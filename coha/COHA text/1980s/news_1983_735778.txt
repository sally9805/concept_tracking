Mr. Segal 's name is worthy of special notice for several reasons : As chairman of Lindoln Center 's board , he wields enormous influence on the cultural life of New York City . More than that , he has not been afraid to use his power , most recently in a controversy that ended with Lincoln Center ditching one of its constituent entities , the Vivian Beaumont Theater . And he 's the first Lincoln Center chairman born in Vitebsk , Russia . His road from Vitebsk to the boardroom was , he says , " the traditional route of immigrants and poor people . " Brought to Brooklyn by his parents when he was five , he began working at 11 . When he was 16. he left school  --  and home  --  to find his fortune . After hitching around and trying an assortment of odd jobs , he returned to New York and an insurance job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was 23 , he had founded his own consulting and actuarial firm , advising businesses on pension and group-insurance plans . " Martin E. Segal Co. has a sabbatical system  --  after 10 years , you get a couple of months off with pay . " says Mr. Segal . " I finally took my sabbatical in the winter of ' 66- ' 67 , and my wife and I went to Pans . We rented a small apartment , and I enrolled in the Academie de la Grande Chaumiere  --  where I learned what I should have learned much earlier in my life : that I 'm not a very good painter . " I was then 50 years old , and I realized that I was n't likely to make any major contributions to my company in terms of new ideas , " he says . So he sold his company to Wertheim &; Co. ( it has since been sold again , to its senior executives ) , becoming a partner in that investment-banking firm . And he began his Involvement with the cultural life of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center . Since 1967 , Mr. Segal has worked with other cultural institutions as well . He 's been on the boards of the Metropolitan Museum and the Museum of Modern Art . He chaired the city 's first Commission on Cultural Affairs , which was instrumental In the creation of an Independent Department of Cultural Affairs . And since 1973 he 's been a member of the Lincoln Center board , which he has chaired since June 1981 . Lincoln Center has had its share of problems since June 1981 . First , there was the removal of its president , John Mazzola , amid accusations of expenseaccount irregularities . Then came labor problems  --  most recently , a strike at the New York City Opera . And finally , Mr. Segal had to confront the Beaumont crisis . But problems do n't faze Mr. Segal . If there 's one thing that both his admirers and his critics agree on , it 's that Martin E. Segal Is good at taking charge . At 67. his dark hair is only lightly flecked with gray . His round spectacles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odds with his well-tailored years now  --  he wears a flower " with everything but my pajamas . " ) And , indeed , there 's nothing cute about the way he 's described by those who know him . " He 's a human dynamo , " says Lincoln Center board member Avery Fisher . " He 's all energy  --  and he does n't just spin his wheels . He knows what has to be done , and he does it . He 's completely dedicated to his responsibilities  --  he 's as far as you can get from a figurehead . " To Diane Coffey , who represents New York 's Mayor Ed Koch on the Lincoln Center board , " he is the voice of the arts in this city . " And the mayor calls him " the finest public servant I know , notwithstanding the fact that he is in the private sector . " And also , presumably . notwithstanding the fact that when Mr. Koch earlier this year proposed to tax some of the property of nonprofit cultural institutions , it was Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , opposition . Even his fiercest detractors  --  and they all refuse to be quoted  --  admit that he has done much for the arts in New York . But they also seem to yearn for the quiet reign of his predecessor at Lincoln Center , the patrician Amyas Ames . They accuse him of seeking to impose control wherever he senses weakness , as at the Beaumont . Mr. Fisher says that Mr. Segal 's ability to initiate change has alienated " people who like to keep their brakes locked . " Joanne Koch. who is now executive director of the Film Society , worked with him there for eight years . She sums up his abilities in one sentence : " If you want something done , you call Marty Segal . " The only time she ever saw him foiled , she says , is the time he tried to persuade Greta Garbo to be the guest of honor at a Film Society gala . When he 's asked how it feels for a kid from Brooklyn to find himself at dinner with Brooke Astor. or at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Every day . " he says . " I am joyously surprised by what has happened to me . I am one of the prime hicks that you 're ever going to meet . " This Is , of course , something of an exaggeration : He 's a voracious reader , and an enthusiastic if less-than-expert student of the arts . But he is conscious of his status as an outsider among New York 's social elite . " There may be people who think the chairman of Lincoln Center should be 6-foot-2 , be a good sailor , and speak with a lockjaw accent . " he laughs . " But I do n't spend much time thinking about what people think about me . I 'm comfortable with myself . " All the same , he once did take sailing lessons .
