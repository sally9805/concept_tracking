" Murder most foul , " wrote Shakespeare of the poisoning of Hamlet 's father , the King of Denmark , " most foul , strange , and unnatural . " Even William Shakespeare might have trouble imagining a crime fouler , stranger and more unnatural than the Tylenol poisonings in Illinois . " This killer is so unusual , " says Clinical Psychologist Samuel Roll of the University of New Mexico , " that our guidelines just do n't work . " <P> Who could be capable of such an act ? What does the murderer hope to gain ? What are the causes of such deranged behavior ? These are the questions occupying police , psychologists and psychiatrists as they try , mostly without success , to form a psychological portrait of the poisoner . <P> Psychologists and psychiatrists agree on only a few points , and even these are highly speculative . First , the murderer is likely to be a loner , isolated and unnoticed , with few if any friends . He is probably low in selfesteem , paranoid and hypersensitive , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Unlike the textbook-case mass murderer , who is often a paranoid schizophrenic , the Tylenol killer is apparently not disabled by delusions or incapacitated by hallucinations . Indeed , the killer 's ability to handle cyanide and put it into small capsules indicates that he is meticulous , well organized and scientifically acute . Says Dr. Shervert Frazier , chief psychiatrist at McLean Hospital in Belmont , Mass. : " He knows how to carry out actions in a goal-oriented , purposeful way . " <P> Psychologists suggest that the killer is a " borderline " personality , someone who can function nearly normally in the day-to-day world . Like John Hinckley , who was also described as " borderline , " the Tylenol killer can appear outwardly conventional . He may undergo transient psychosis intermixed with healthy intervals . Herbert Quay , professor of psychology at the University of Miami , notes chillingly : " My guess is that there are people around the killer right now who think he or she is odd , but not a threat to their lives . " <P> According to Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco , the personality of the arsonist or bomber , rather than the mass murderer , may be the most appropriate model for understanding the Tylenol murderer . " Other killers , " he says , " have a certain satisfaction in stalking their victims . But this is a much more technically oriented crime ; the killer does not perceive as clearly the actual death of his victims . " Who gets killed appears to be a matter of indifference . Even gunmen like Charles Whitman , who killed 16 people from his perch in a Texas tower in 1966 , have more direct contact with their victims . Rarely have the time and distance between murderous act and deadly result been greater . Anonymous poisoning is a remote-control crime , allowing the killer to feel omnipotent by rendering the public terrifyingly powerless . <P>
