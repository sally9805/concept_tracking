The Army 's supersecret Delta Force had a vital mission last October : fly to the Mediterranean and prepare to rescue the hostages aboard the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro . But there was an unusual last-minute hitch . An undisclosed number of the elite counterterrorist troops were under investigation for in effect cheating on their expense accounts , and had to get a special dispensation from the Pentagon to leave their home base at Fort Bragg , N.C. <P> That awkward incident was only one result of a review of some $150 million in expenditures by the Army 's Special Operations Forces and its Delta Force on covert operations between 1981 and 1983 . Investigators for both the Army and the Justice Department suspect that a small number of the Delta Force troops may have diverted as much as $500,000 to personal use and that a Special Operations colonel and perhaps three of his colleagues stole at least $60,000 , mainly by double-billing the Government for claimed expenses . <P> The officer , Lieut . Colonel Dale Duncan , 39 , was indicted on seven counts last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was charged with submitting vouchers for $56,230 for the purchase of electronic equipment in August 1982 , even though an Army intelligence agency had already paid for the same gear . Duncan also allegedly submitted a bill for $8,400 , to charter a private aircraft , that had already been almost entirely paid for . The indictment claims as well that Duncan charged the Army $796 for a four-flight airline ticket that he got free through a frequent-flyer program . Duncan , who has sued the Army for violating his privacy by trying to obtain his American Express Card records , denied any wrongdoing . " He 's not a Rambo , " said his lawyer , John Dowd . " He 's a quiet , intelligent guy . " <P> The Delta Force soldiers are accused of accepting cash advances for trips abroad , then routinely inflating claims of what they had spent and pocketing the difference . Fewer than 100 soldiers are under investigation by the Army . <P> The deceptive practices had gone undetected , former Army officers say , mainly because of loose controls over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such undercover operations face practical accounting problems . Units are often dispatched in a hurry , requiring large cash advances . If requisitions and paper procedures are elaborate , too many people could learn about a mission , compromising both its secrecy and speed . " That 's the penalty you pay , " said a retired Army general , " when you permit an organization to report only to God . " Since the Army will not admit publicly that Delta Force even exists , proving that its members pocketed money that was also carefully concealed may not be easy .
