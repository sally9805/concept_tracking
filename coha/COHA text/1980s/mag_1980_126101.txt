Whether you want to jog around the block near your hotel or take a 40-km. run through Berlin 's Grunewald Park  --  where the deer and the wild boar play  --  A Runner 's Guide to Europe ( Penguin Books , paperback , $5.95 ) is just what you need . Coauthors Jere Van Dyk , a sometime 4:00.1 miler from the University of Oregon , and Aden Hayes have done their homework and put together a compendium of running venues covering 24 cities from Helsinki to Florence . // The Guide offers an assortment of city runs and tells how to get to the most suitable parks , forests , tracks and boulevards . The authors heartily endorse riding the train , subway or bus in sweat suits to more distant courses . // They tell you what to wear ; when to run to beat the traffic ; where not to run and what cultural attractions , restaurants and pubs are along the route . They also fill the reader in on local customs , climate and personal safety , especially as it pertains to female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tennis and squash facilities . // Van Dyk 's and Hayes ' favorite courses include Edinburgh 's Holyrood Park , Paris ' Bois de Boulogne , Oslo 's Sognsvann forest , Copenhagen 's Jaegersborg Dyrehave ( 3,500 acres of woods , hills and ponds , which , the authors claim , is perhaps the best running site in Europe ) , Brussels ' For ? t de Soignes and Helsinki 's Pirkkola Sports Park . A Van Dyk-Hayes special : a predawn lope to the Acropolis for an inspiring view of Athens and the sea beyond . // Though the Guide lists running loops in all 24 cities , Rome is described as " a tough course " and Milan as a place with comparatively few places for runners to " stride out . " // The Van Dyk-Hayes directions can get quite complicated as they suggest several options for running a course  --  varying distances and degrees of difficulty  --  while trying to keep the runner from getting lost . Schematic maps would have helped . // But that omission is balanced out by : // A glossary so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ krio tsai ) , yogurt in Finnish ( jugurtti ) or dark beer in Swedish ( m ? rkt ? l ) . // Anecdotal wisdom . Women runners should avoid Dublin 's Connelly Street train station area at night because it gets " a bit ugly , " the authors , who apparently have run every course in the Guide , tell us . They also advise buying cloudberries ( known as laaka ) in Helsinki 's central outdoor market after a run and not to worry about the bats in Madrid 's Retiro Park because they hang out only along a short stretch . The National Gardens , they say , are " the only spot in central Athens where you can smell the eucalyptus over the exhaust fumes , " and they warn you to keep off the grass in Viennese parks . // Whether you 're in Europe on business or vacation , the Guide says that running offers a special advantage . Write Van Dyk and Hayes , " Paris at dawn  --  before the cars , the horns and the traffic jams  --  is quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen on a run . "  --  RICHARD ROGIN // The evidence on Bjorn Borg , as it filters through on the television screen and in news accounts , is that he 's a pleasant young man , somewhat shy and diffident , fiercely protective of his privacy , deeply in love with his radiant bride  --  and one of the best tennis players ever to step on a court . // But Borg does not appear to be an inordinately interesting fellow , and Bjorn Borg : My Life and Game ( Simon and Schuster , $11.95 ) , written in collaboration with Eugene L. Scott , is not an interesting book . Like Nancy Lopez ' The Education of a Woman Golfer ( SI , Nov. 19 , 1979 ) , the book seems to exist for no other reason than the celebrity of its subject ; it discloses nothing of particular moment about Borg 's life , and as a tennis instruction manual it has little value . // In fact , Borg remarks that " I have broken nearly every rule recommended by instruction books over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a game of instinct and common sense rather than proper grips and tedious tips . " What he 's saying , in other words , is that the advice he offers is n't going to be much more helpful than the advice anyone else offers . // That being the case , why then should one read Bjorn Borg : My Life and Game ? Well , if it interests you , there 's a complete list of the products he endorses  --  nearly 40 of them , by my count  --  ranging from a Bjorn Borg calendar to a Bjorn Borg doll to a Bjorn Borg soft drink . There 's the hot disclosure that Borg thinks American television is the cat 's pajamas : " Do you know that people from Sweden come to the U.S. on vacation for two weeks , get a hotel room , turn on the color TV and never leave the room ? " // Borg tells us that in his matches against Roscoe Tanner on a fast surface , his return of service is crucial : " Take that away from me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that " the fury of a McEnroe-Borg rivalry has not yet had a chance to boil over . " He reminds us that as a teen-ager he was regarded as the " Bad Boy " of Swedish tennis and had to bring his temper under control by an act of willpower. // What 's the point of all this ? So far as I can tell , it is to " humanize " Borg , to make him seem less the iceman and more the ordinary guy . But is that really necessary ? Why ca n't we just admire Borg for his stupendous skills , and leave it at that ? He belongs on the tennis court , not in the pages of a perfunctory , exploitative book .  --  JONATHAN YARDLEY // John Jerome started out with an imaginative idea for a magazine article : an examination of the physiological forces at work when an athlete hits the " sweet spot "  --  when he or she makes a " perfect " leap or swing or throw . But Jerome made an entire book out of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The book is The Sweet Spot in Time ( Summit Books , $13.95 ) . It runs to nearly 350 pages , too many of which seem to exist merely to fill space . Although the book is well-intentioned and informative , so much of it  --  especially in the first half  --  is extraneous or discursive that the reader 's patience is soon exhausted . // An example of Jerome 's sweet-spot theory that 's doubtless still vivid in the minds of many fans occurred in the fourth game of the 1980 World Series . With the second of the two homers he stroked that afternoon , Willie Aikens hit the sweet spot right on the nose . From the exquisite crack of bat against ball , to the ball 's majestic flight that carried deep into the rightfield bullpen , to the heroic follow-through with which Aikens finished off his feat  --  it was a moment of sheer sports perfection . // What Jerome seeks to explain is how and why such moments occur . His explorations are based in large part on the relatively new science of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the use of objective techniques to analyze patterns of body movement , the timing of body movements , and the forces which create or result from movement . " // The fundamental point of biomechanics , Jerome writes , is that " every human movement , from raising a cup of tea to the lips to pole-vaulting eighteen feet , is a product of levers moving through arcs . " Later he writes : " Once one begins to comprehend human movement in terms of levers and arcs , the necessity , in sports , for good arcs  --  for true trajectories , accurate timings , impeccable meetings of subject and object  --  becomes apparent . It is inescapable . " // Perhaps so . But between those two statements lie fully 170 pages of divagation . Before getting into a specific discussion of the various elements of sports performance , Jerome insists on taking the reader on a tour of the human body : Anatomy 101 . He makes an earnest effort to write science for the layman , but he ends up with prose that patronizes the reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuteness , too little clear explanation . // When at last he finishes the anatomical tour d'horizon , the book picks up . There are enlightening discussions of the revolution in sports equipment ( shoes , for example , better designed to accommodate the workings of the human foot ) , the use of steroids and amphetamines , the evolution of the East German sports factory , the research being conducted at such centers of sports science as Penn State and Ball State . // All of this is fine , and Jerome 's enthusiasm for his subject is attractive . But his book fails on three counts . Its prose is irritating and self-indulgent . It does n't make complex scientific information comprehensible to the general reader . And it drifts off onto so many highways and byways that it loses sight of its central subject . Too often you find yourself asking : " But what does this have to do with the sweet spot ? " Any book that loses its main theme is a book in trouble .  --  JONATHAN YARDLEY       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
