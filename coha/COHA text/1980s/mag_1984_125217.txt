Finally , it was time for Ben Crenshaw . All the years , all the torment , all the disappointments faded into the tall Georgia pines on Sunday as the most popular golfer since Arnold Palmer won his first major championship , the Masters . It will also be remembered that Crenshaw won it over a leader board full of deadly assassins , that he won it on the back nine of the Augusta National course , where so many souls and titles have been lost or misplaced , and that he held on to it when it was only his to lose . As the little 32-year-old Texan walked up the last fairway , you could have watered the dogwoods with the tears of joy that were streaming out of the thousands whose hopes he had crushed so often . In a way , this one was for them . // Here was pro golf 's onetime glamour boy living up to a reputation that had been dragging him through the bunkers and the trees for more than a decade , erasing the sorrow in a dashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Ben , " the nickname his father had given his magic putter so many years ago . // We all remember the early Crenshaw . He was " the cute Jack Nicklaus , " just what the sport needed . He seemed to have been born on a magazine cover . He had ravaged amateur golf as a teenager . He had owned college golf , winning three NCAA titles at the University of Texas . Ben 's Wrens had become a popular slogan on buttons and T shirts wherever he played and he had the following of a rock star , except that he played the putter. // After qualifying for the PGA Tour in 1973 , he won his very first tournament and the thought was that Nicklaus had better lose even more weight and that Ben 's Wrens were surely going to outnumber Lee 's Fleas . The advice to Crenshaw from almost everyone was : Do n't listen to anybody . Do n't change a thing . Hit it , go find it and let Little Ben take it from there . // There was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was highly unpredictable , and on the PGA Tour the competition was a little tougher than it was on the teenage amateur circuit . And that swing just seemed to get looser and less reliable as the years passed by . But he could always count on his putting . Tom Kite , his old Austin high school adversary and college teammate and rival , once said , " I do n't remember Ben ever missing a putt from the time he was 12 until he was 20. " // He had been in contention for a major title so many times  --  at the U.S. Open , the British Open , the PGA Championship  --  and each time an unforeseen calamity had struck . Five times he had been a runner-up in a major  --  including last year 's Masters , won by Seve Ballesteros  --  while other players who were less talented , and surely less popular , had celebrated into the night . But this time he looked all week long like a young man with a purpose , and what he did in the last round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , for a change . He played the best golf of his life from tee to green , avoided every catastrophe and , when he had to , he called on Little Ben , the best club in his bag . // There will be those who may choose to remember the 48th Masters as a championship that Crenshaw won on Sunday with Little Ben because of the 60-foot birdie putt he made at the 10th hole , the 12-foot birdie at the evil par-3 12th and the 15-footer , saving par , at the 14th . But those were really the only big putts Crenshaw holed in the four rounds , so the most satisfying thing of all for him was that he won the Masters the way great tournaments are supposed to be won  --  by playing golf shots . // His closing 68 , a four-under round that brought him home with an 11-under total of 277 and a two-stroke victory over Tom Watson , was mostly a round of inspiration . Back on Thursday , he had opened with a nearly flawless five-under , 67 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a round in which he hit 17 greens in regulation and missed only two fairways off the tee . If he had been able to drop three or four putts of any length he might have won the tournament going away . // The two middle rounds , a 72 on Friday and a 70 that began on Saturday and ended early Sunday morning because of rain delays , might well have been the most critical for him . He got a little wild off the tee and made a few bogeys , but never did he stagger into the double bogey that might have undone him . There had been a couple of close calls but both times he rammed home three-foot putts for bogeys . This is called saving strokes . And it 's also called confidence . // The real tip-off on Crenshaw may have revealed itself on Friday when he made five birdies and still only shot the 72 because of minor errors . He was playing beautifully , swinging better than ever and reading both the speed and the break of the slick greens better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lead to a stranger named Mark Lye , a diabetic who had stunned Augusta in his first Masters appearance with rounds of 69 and 66 while munching on his candy bars between shots . But like every other experienced competitor in the field , Crenshaw had to believe that Lye would eventually go away . This he did , with rounds of 73-74 , to finish in a tie for sixth place . Crenshaw knew he had to keep thinking about his own game . This he did . // " I 've been trying to believe in myself for the past year and a half , " Crenshaw said Sunday night . " I went back to my old swing and concentrated mainly on aiming the ball and on my timing . I spent 10 years working on my swing , and it did n't get me anything but a lot of disappointment . My dad was the one who said I had to go back to my old swing and live with it . There are a lot of funny swings in golf . Who wants Miller Barber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many solid shots as anybody . " // Crenshaw played 13 of his third-round holes on Saturday , before rain , hail and lightning prematurely concluded play . Those still on the course were obliged to come back out on Sunday at 8 a.m. , and that was when Kite took the Masters lead by two strokes over Crenshaw and by one over Lye . // Sunday morning was the unseen golf . Few showed up early to watch when Tom Watson went back out to miss a 15-foot eagle putt at the 13th and par in the rest of the way . Kite went back out to save par from a bunker at the 12th and then birdied two more holes , including the 18th , to take the third-round lead . Lye went back out to the 12th to three-putt for a bogey , then found two bunkers at the 16th for his third double bogey of the tournament . // Lye had been the comic relief of this Masters . A 31-year-old bachelor , consumer of something called Nature Valley Chewy Granola Bars , a guy who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of Eric Clapton 's band , a lanky 6 ' 2 " string bean with a funny gait and a big smile , Lye would say after his Friday 66 , " I have n't had to deal with any funky 40-footers . I have no idea what those greens are doing out there . I do n't think I can save any more shots than I already have . " // Thus the first three rounds served largely to set the stage for the drama on Sunday , which overshadows everything that comes before it in most Masters . Crenshaw was simply one of a crowd when it came time for the last 18 . A total of 18 players were within six strokes of the lead . Eight players were within four shots of Kite , who led with a nine-under 207 . Lye was at 208 , Crenshaw , Nick Faldo and David Graham were at 209 , and Watson was at 210 . Larry Nelson was considered a serious lurker at 211 after rounds of 69 and 66 had made up for his woeful start of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Watson , Graham and Nelson , who had won 12 majors between them , who would know and understand what the pressure was going to be like because they had overcome it before  --  unlike himself . // Crenshaw played smoothly and confidently to a three-under 33 through nine holes with birdies at the par-5 2nd and 8th and then a beauty of a 10-foot birdie at the 9th . With nine holes to play , Crenshaw held a one-stroke lead on Kite and a two-shot lead on Nelson . Watson and Lye were three back . // If ever there was going to be a time when bad memories got the best of Crenshaw , it was going to be now . He 'd once stood on the 71st tee with a two-iron in his hand tied for the lead of the U.S. Open . That was at Medinah in 1975 . But that long , loose , unreliable swing had put a two-iron in the water . The result was a crushing double bogey that caused him to miss the Lou Graham-John Mahaffey playoff by a stroke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Royal Lytham again tied for the lead , of the British Open . But that long , loose , unreliable swing had sent his tee shot soaring into the heather . The result was another double bogey , and he watched Ballesteros win that championship . Two weeks after that he 'd gone into a playoff for the PGA Championship at Oakland Hills with David Graham . This time he bunkered his tee shot on the third extra hole while Graham birdied , and Crenshaw and his fans had once again been torn apart by a near miss  --  or a near win . // Now , on the back nine at Augusta , the possibility was always there that Crenshaw and his admirers might suffer another heartbreak .
