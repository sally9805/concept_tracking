Like children listening to a favorite bedtime story , classical audiences love to hear the same works over and over , and most of the time the record companies give them what they want : Bach Brandenburgs without end , Beethoven symphonies without number . Occasionally , however , a darker side surfaces , and . something different is unearthed : arcana by a famous composer , perhaps , or a new piece by a living artist that seeks to reveal the skull beneath the skin .
