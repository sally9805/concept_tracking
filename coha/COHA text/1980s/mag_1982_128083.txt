When San Francisco 's Joe Morgan hit a three-run , line-shot homer in the seventh inning at Candlestick Park on Sunday afternoon , Los Angeles Pitcher Terry Forster tossed his glove high in the air and the crowd of 47,457 cheered riotously as Morgan jubilantly rounded the bases . " I knew I was going to get a hit , " the 39-year-old second baseman said afterward . " Nothing out there is new to me anymore . " Forster worked the count to one-two and then threw what he would later describe as " the biggest mistake of my career "  --  a hanging slider . Morgan got all of it , and the Dodgers were finished for 1982. // Shortly after L.A. 's 5-3 loss , Forster sat slumped on a stool outside his clubhouse cubicle . " There was no excuse for it , " he said . " That 's the worst exhibition I 've ever put on in a key game . One pitch ! One pitch can win or lose a pennant . " // First Baseman Steve Garvey of the dethroned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over . " I 'm stalling in taking this thing off , " he said , contemplating a future in some other uniform . " You do n't spend 12 years of your life  --  12 years of exhilaration and low points , 12 important years  --  and not become reflective . " // It was appropriate that a Giant should decide the division title because at the start of the chaotic final week of the regular season , the advantage among the three contenders appeared to be entirely with San Francisco . The Giants had just finished sweeping three games at Dodger Stadium and were the hottest team in the majors . As last week began they had won five in a row , 10 of 12 and 18 of 22 . On Sept. 4 they had been nine games out of first . Now they were only one behind the Dodgers and Braves , and San Francisco 's final seven games would be at home . // With only 10 games remaining in the season , the Dodgers had been three games ahead in first place . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more fans this year  --  3,608,881  --  than any team in baseball history , but the rooters had lately become hooters . " Maybe I should hang a funeral wreath here , " a Dodger Stadium elevator operator had said before last Thursday 's game with Atlanta , when the L.A. slide was standing at eight . // But there 's no figuring baseball . Los Angeles broke its streak with a vengeance that night , demolishing the Braves 10-3 . " A team can go into a slump , " said Manager Tom Lasorda . " It 's improper to call it a choke . " When the laughter was over , many of the fans called loudly for Garvey , who had gone 3 for 3 . Garvey 's contract will expire at the end of the year , and the feeling is that the Dodgers wo n't make a sincere enough effort to re-sign him . The Thursday game could well have been his last at home , so the fans rose spontaneously to wish him a presumptive adieu . Tears formed in the eyes of this man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he impulsively tossed his cap into the stands . // Now it was on to San Francisco . The Giants had lost two games badly , 7-0 and 8-3 , to the Braves , missing a golden chance to move into first . But then they had beaten Houston 6-1 and 7-6 . So on Friday a season-high 53,281 showed up for the showdown with L.A. Both teams were now one behind the Braves with three to play . // During San Francisco 's long surge , Manager Frank Robinson had seemed virtually infallible . Until Friday night . For seven innings , the Dodgers ' Jerry Reuss and the Giants ' Fred Breining had pitched scoreless baseball . But in the eighth , Breining loaded the bases by allowing a single and two walks to bring Robinson out to the mound . Ace lefthander Al Holland was warming up in the bullpen , and the next scheduled Dodger batter was the lefthand-hitting Rick Monday . The choice seemed very obvious . // But no . After a brief admonition to Breining  --  " You got yourself into this jam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on his way back to the dugout . Breining worked Monday to a one-one count and then threw him his specialty , the forkball . Monday hit it into the football bleachers in right center . The grand slam was all Reuss needed in the 4-0 win . Breining 's pitch seemed to take something out of the Giants because the Dodgers finished them for good , 15-2 , on Saturday . // Robinson was disappointed but far from discouraged . " It has been a good year , " he said . " When you go to the next to last game still in the running , you 've got to be pleased . We learned a lot , grew a lot . " Enough it seemed to win the division , even if it was for another team .
