From the moment in 1963 when CBS became the first network to expand its 15- minute nightly newscast to half an hour , visionaries there and at rivals NBC and ABC began to talk of the logical next step : a full hour of news . A quarter-century later , they are still just talking . But upstart Cable News Network , the 24-hour information service that began in 1980 and reaches 52 million households , has taken that step . Last week CNN launched The World Today , a 60-minute newscast ( airtime : 6 to 7 p.m . EST ) that in much of the U.S. competes head to head with the shows anchored by Dan Rather , Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings . <P> Stacked up against those three white middle-aged men was an anchor team that made a striking symbolic statement . Washington-based Bernard Shaw , CNN 's leading political correspondent , is black ; Catherine Crier , based at the network 's Atlanta headquarters , is a woman . Inadvertently , the choice of Crier , brought in from outside in preference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement about the abiding importance of looks and packaging in TV news . A former college beauty-contest finalist and later an elected Texas judge , Crier , 34 , has no journalism experience . <P> While Crier is articulate , she gave the opening installments more than her share of bumpy moments , including one glaring error . Reading a story about alleged CIA action against foreign governments , she indicated that socialist Salvador Allende Gossens had ruled Chile " from 1963 to 1973 . " As any news junkie would be likely to remember , Allende came to power in 1970 , amid criticism from President Richard Nixon . Co-anchor Shaw so far sounds muted in his enthusiasm . Says he : " What she 's been doing has been very adequate . " <P> Other aspects of the show need fine tuning . Heavy reliance on live coverage led to an excess of pleasantries and some outright glitches . On Wednesday a San Francisco earthquake survivor was so upset by watching footage of the disaster that she bolted from the studio before her scheduled appearance . On Thursday a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CNN uses the hour to do a few stories fully rather than pepper the viewer with here-and-gone 30-second items , but last week 's feature pieces often seemed simply long , not deep . Moreover , the hour seemed deliberately broken into two repetitive half-hour shows , covering much the same topics in slightly different fashion . <P> Executives at the three established networks noted that the opening show achieved a mere .7 rating , meaning that just seven cable households per thousand tuned in , one twenty-fourth of the audience typically commanded by each of the Big Three newscasts . Said a top NBC news official : " I 'm more concerned about erosion of our audience from nonnews sources ( ( entertainment shows , VCRs and so on ) ) than competing news sources . I do n't think this is going to make any difference to us . " Of course , that 's what the Big Three used to say , with misguided optimism , about CNN as a whole .                @ @ @ @ @
