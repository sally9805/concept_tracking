" Even though in essence I ' d been telling everybody I was going to retire after this year , I felt like I ' d dropped a bomb , " Evert said last week . She has spent the last two years trying to work up the confidence to leave a sport that she once dominated but that has lately left her unfulfilled. // " For a moment I just panicked , but then I calmed down and realized that I feel very comfortable with my decision , " said Evert , whose emotional ties to the tournament where she made her debut in pigtails and ribbons at 16 prompted her to goad herself back into competitive shape one last time. // " If I didn ' t feel competitive I wouldn ' t play , " she said . " I wouldn ' t go out and lose to a qualifier . I wouldn ' t do that to myself . It ' s helped me to motivate myself knowing that this is the first tournament where it all began . " <> <> Roadblocks Ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her 18 Opens , winning six times . Last year , she became the first semifinalist ever to default after a stomach virus forced her withdrawal from her match against Steffi Graf , the defending and eventual champion . Evert said she was realistic about the roadblocks looming between her and a storybook finale here , roadblocks that include a potential meeting with Martina Navratilova , who holds a 43-37 edge in their cherished rivalry. // " If I lose in the second round of the Open it ' s not going to be a disaster , " Evert said , " because I have another life now . But I ' d be very disappointed. " // The repeated disappointment of leaving tournaments without capturing the titles she had long assumed as part of her identity finally caught up with Evert this year . In the past , she had always been afraid to separate herself from tennis because she had no secure self-image away from it. // " It was the most important thing in my life , I put all of my emotions , everything into tennis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that ' s why I didn ' t retire . " <> <> Tennis Based on Patience // Navratilova eclipsed her , and then came Graf , until at the age of 34 , Evert , still sticking like a burr to the baseline and launching an endless stream of her patented two-fisted backhands , seemed to be the last remaining adherent to tennis based on patience rather than power. // But she slowly began to lose her patience with the game , and every match became a nerve-racking debate between her doubts about her willingness to make necessary sacrifices and her desire to remain a winner. // With 18 grand slam titles , a record 157 singles titles , seven years at No. 1 , winnings of more than $8. 8 million , and a career match record of 1 , 300-144 , Evert knew she could not cope as gracefully with a decline as she had with her ascension. // " Until this year I always had the feeling that I was going for the grand slam tournaments and that I had a chance to be No. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt , ' Well , it ' s tough , ' and I didn ' t want to make that emotional commitment , and even if I did , I knew there ' d be no guarantee . " <> <> Rosy Picture of Retirement // Evert got such a rosy picture of retirement from her husband , Andy Mill , a former Olympic skier , that it started to resemble a promised land. // Long before Evert could imagine any virtues in retirement , Mill was insisting that she would do herself a favor by leaving tennis before it had time to administer a psychological battering. // " He was the only one who really saw me behind closed doors and knew what I was feeling after a tournament , " said Evert , who married Mill a year ago . " Before he met me , he had this image of Chris Evert the winner , the champion , and then as a husband , and as someone who followed my career , he didn ' t want me to put myself through this anymore. " // Evert will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longtime sponsors like Wilson , Converse , and Ellesse . She and Mill have homes in Boca Raton , Fla. , and Aspen , Colo . " I ' ve never really had a home before , " said Evert , referring to her nomadic schedule on the circuit since she completed high school . " And after spending five weeks in Florida during the French Open and five weeks in Aspen after Wimbledon , I found out how content I was to just be at home . " The couple also intend to have children. // Evert said the United States Open would not be her last tournament . She will play in the Federation Cup in Tokyo in October , has a series of exhibitions scheduled with Navratilova and may compete in the Virginia Slims Championships. // What she is closing out of her life is the anxiety and stress of the grand slams , the tournaments that have been her beacons ever since she entered the 1971 United States Open and , to everyone ' s surprise but her own , advanced to the semifinals against Billie Jean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuss that was made over me , " said Evert , who shuttled from her aunt ' s home in Larchmont to Forest Hills and was packed right back to high school in Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , by her father and coach , Jimmy , as soon as her semifinal match ended . " I wasn ' t intimidated , I was always very composed , " she said . " I was just so single-minded . I was also really mad at my dad when he made me go right back to school. " // That Open , she said , was the event that rearranged her life and dictated the way she would live for the next 18 years. // " I went back to school and Life magazine came and took pictures , and I was so embarrassed , " recalled Evert , voted Most Likely to Succeed , Most Popular , but not Most Athletic - a fact she still finds funny - by her classmates . " At that point the Open changed my whole life : nothing was sacred and private anymore . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me right now . But it ' s also why , when I thought about retiring after Wimbledon , I was thinking , in the back of my mind , ' Gosh , the U.S. Open . That ' s where it all began. ' " //
