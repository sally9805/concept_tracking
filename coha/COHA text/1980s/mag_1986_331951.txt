Less than a month after its narrow victory in national elections , France 's new center-rightist coalition led by Prime Minister Jacques Chirac began last week to reshape the country 's economy . First it managed to wring out of the European Community an agreement to devalue the franc by the equivalent of 6% against the West German mark . Then the new Prime Minister announced that he would denationalize up to 57 banks and companies , many of which had been nationalized before the Socialists came to power five years ago . <P> Though Chirac 's program was passed by 292 votes to 285 , its success is by no means assured . Socialist President Francois Mitterrand , with whom Chirac shares power , has already indicated that he will oppose any attempt to denationalize companies taken over before 1981.
