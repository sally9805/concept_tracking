In SoHo , more than 100 Russian aristocrats will be waltzing in a scarlet turn-of-the-century ballroom . In Central Park , runners dressed as firemen will be poised to race with a pet Dalmatian , and a West Side photographer will prepare to bite into his favorite chicken club sandwich. // Those are some of the plans of New Yorkers this year as they look to New Year ' s Eve , a holiday more diverse in diversions than any other night of the year . If New Yorkers have anything in common on New Year ' s Eve , it is probably that they will all pass into 1985 trying to do something a little bit different. // First , of course , there is the luxurious approach. // Lorna H. Lee , a production assistant with WNEW-TV , will travel by limousine to a black-tie party at the Surf Club , a hot spot these days for young executives . " I just got this dress , strapless , full-length black velvet , very narrow , very fitted to the body , with a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies on the hips , " she says . " The whole thing is very thin. " // At the SoHo loft of Alexandr Neratoff , an architect and former secretary of the Russian Nobility Association , the scene will resemble the beginning of " Dr. Zhivago . " His gathering will bring descendants of the aristocracy toppled by Lenin to an early 20th-century-style ballroom complete with neo-classical white columns and 12-foot-high windows . They will dance , sip champagne and nibble on black caviar and smoked salmon. // Meanwhile , in New York harbor , a sheik from Bahrain will entertain his party of 200 on the Riveranda , a 147- foot yacht , according to Rick Quattrini , a vice president of World Yacht Enterprises , which charters the boat . The sheik , whose identity was not disclosed , has requested that two Nebuchadnezzars of champagne - the largest size available - be opened at midnight . Although he is unfamiliar with the trajectory characteristics of the giant corks , Mr. Quattrini says there is little danger that they will hit a tugboat or otherwise interfere with harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuits. // Michael Meyerson , who teaches at Brooklyn Law School , and his wife , Lesly Berger , a writer and editor , plan to pack their 7-month-old son , William Paul , into his baby backpack and set out for Prospect Park in Brooklyn . There they will watch a fireworks display , along with a light show by Krzysztof Wodiczko , an artist who will project bright images onto the arch at Grand Army Plaza . " It ' s a good start for William ' s first New Year ' s Eve , " Mr. Meyerson said . " It ' s not Times Square , but it will be colorful and festive. " // <> <> Pate and a Midnight Run // At the midnight run in Central Park , Jane Alling , an executive with a financial public relations concern , says she will stake out the turf for her party with champagne- and pate- stocked coolers across the road from Tavern on the Green . Miss Alling says she purchased six oversized white dinner jackets so that some of her 20 guests can run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to run dressed as firemen in the company of her pet Dalmatian. // " We already have the prop , " she says . " It would be a shame not to do it. " // New Year ' s Eve is disparaged by many New Yorkers who declare they will have no part of parties or group libations , and some devoted New Year ' s Eve opponents seem far more passionate about the holiday than the most outrageous merrymakers. // " Not doing a damn thing , " says Thomas Hoving , the editor in chief of Connoisseur magazine and former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art . " I don ' t like forced frivolity. " // Charles Addams , the cartoonist , expresses similar sentiments : " It ' s a night to stay home and drink a bottle of champagne with a friend , or even with your wife.

" I ' ve always considered it an amateur ' s night , " she explains. // Possibly the best organized expression of anti-New Year ' s sentiment takes place at a summer house in Sagaponack , L.I. , where a group of New Yorkers annually observe a ceremony described as a modest proposal for the elimination of holidays . " Every one of us is resistant to New Year ' s , " says Joanna Cotler , author of " The Rotating Spaghetti Fork , " a mail-order catalogue of strange and unusual things , " so we decided to have one day a year when you celebrate every holiday , do whatever you want to do and get it over with. " // The celebrators arrive using aliases - last year ' s entourage included LaMont , Ziggy , Minky Coates , Luna Levine and Butch Schnabble . If the weather is good , they spend much of the night on the beach wrapped in blankets , washing down grilled oysters and pasta primavera with champagne. // There is another category of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but shun its excesses with a Spartan zeal . Simon Nathan , a West Side photographer , for example , says he and his date , Nancy Kiteley , an A.T. &; T. executive , plan to keep the cost of their evening below $22 this year . After attending an Ingmar Bergman double feature at the Metro Cinema on Broadway , they will walk next door to a fast-food restaurant , which Mr. Nathan describes as " the finest Wendy ' s on the West Side . " If their favorite table is not already taken , he says , they will sit there , under a blown-up picture of the Dakota apartments in wintertime. // " I ' m going to order the new chicken club sandwich , which includes bacon , for $2. 49 , " he says , " I ' ll order an extra layer of bacon , which costs 40 cents more . But you have to be careful with extra bacon . Sometimes the kitchen forgets . When it comes out , you ' ve got to ask , ' Has this sandwich been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
