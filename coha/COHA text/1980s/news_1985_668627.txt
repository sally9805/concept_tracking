Atari Corp. made an unexpected appearance at last week ' s Comdex personal computer trade show here to try to persuade a skeptical industry that the company was viable and that its new products would soon come to market . But after two days of statements that seemed contradictory , vague promises about the future of a new computer and sketchy descriptions of future models , there seemed to be more doubters than ever . " We ' ve seen marketing strategies changed before our eyes , " said Barbara Isgur , an analyst and consultant who follows the consumer electronics industry , as she emerged from an Atari meeting . Others expressed amazement that Jack Tramiel , Atari ' s tough-talking and unpredictable owner , was still the center of industry attention , even while his products and company faced an uncertain fate . Tramiel bought the company from Warner Communications Inc. last year after he was ousted as chief executive of Commodore International Ltd . , Atari ' s archrival . The deal involved no cash and gave Warner a 32 percent stake in the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tramiel has replaced all of the executives and is rapidly replacing the product line . Everywhere that Tramiel went in the sprawling Georgia World Congress Center , where the Comdex show was held , he seemed to leave a trail of confusion . Most of it concerned an innovative , $800 home computer , called the Atari 520ST . Like Commodore ' s forthcoming Amiga computer , which was shown only to a select few in a hotel room near the conference , the Atari machine sports the fancy graphics and easy-to-use features of Apple Computer Inc. ' s Macintosh . Both will sell for about a third of the Macintosh ' s price . The Atari computer ' s graphics are stunning , and unlike the Macintosh , it works in color . Many in the decimated home computer and software industry are rooting for Atari , hoping it will make consumers excited about computers once again . Hoever , Atari ' s first promise is already going sour . Early in the year , Tramiel said shipment of the 520SL would begin by April , a statement Atari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date became July . With July two months away , it was still not clear where those shipments would be headed . In January , when he first showed the computer , Tramiel said the 520SL would be sold in the same manner as previous Atari and Commodore home machines : through mass marketers such as K mart and Toys ' R ' Us . By last Monday , the plan had changed . Tramiel said the machine was too complex for untrained salesmen and competed with far more expensive models , so it would be sold through computer specialty stores , alongside IBM PCs and Apples . At a news conference last Tuesday , he changed the plan again . The sophisticated version would be sold in specialty stores , and a stripped-down , less-powerful model , the 520ST , never before publicly mentioned , would be on mass-marketers ' shelves by August . " The press seems to have trouble getting this right , " Tramiel said . When Atari officials were asked at the news conference to list the computer dealers that would be handling the 520ST when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . As a result , few in the industry believe they will ever see production models of the 520ST . Those who do , doubt it will happen any time soon . Computer specialty stores have been shy of Tramiel since his Commodore days , when he first sold his inexpensive computers through them , then abruptly provided the products to discounters . That left the specialty stores with large inventories of overpriced machines and few warm feelings for Tramiel . Now , though , in the absence of many other computers to offer home users , especially after the demise of IBM ' s PCjr , retailers may have no choice but to deal with Tramiel . " IBM and Apple are really not treating the low end of the market right , " said William E. Ladin Jr. , chairman of Computercraft , a chain of 61 computer stores in the Southwest . " Jack Tramiel has the right idea . I ' d like to see it all work out . " Even Ladin , however , worries whether it is worth the effort to sell an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explaining to sell a PCjr to a first-time customer for $800 than to sell a $5000 PC-AT to a veteran , " Ladin said , recalling IBM ' s Christmas promotion of the PCjr . " We sold a bunch , but my salesmen hated me . " Software is another problem for Atari . While the new Atari machine is similar to the Macintosh , it uses an entirely different operating system , called Gem , that was designed by Digital Research Inc . Atari officials assert that more than 100 software titles will be available for the machine , most written by small software houses that desperately need work . At the show , Sigmund Hartmann , a former Commodore executive brought in by Tramiel to head the software effort , also hinted that the prestigious Microsoft International Inc. might be preparing a program or two for the Atari machine . " We ' re shipping them a machine , and they ' re real interested , " he said . The next day , though , Microsoft Chairman William Gates said , " At this point we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
