Super Bowl XXIII , like most things in football , began with Paul Brown . He hired Bill Walsh in the 1960s to assist in coaching the new Cincinnati Bengals . When Walsh got his own command in San Francisco , reserve quarterback Sam Wyche followed along to tutor passers . Together Wyche and Walsh scouted and drafted Notre Dame 's Joe Montana . In two triumphant Super Bowls , Montana has been the player of the game . Now he is the central figure in a third . <P> Meanwhile , Brown retrieved Wyche five years ago to coach Cincinnati  --  as it happens , the 49ers ' opponent this Super Sunday in Miami . For the first time in many a Roman numeral , perhaps in the whole stolid history of the most consistently disappointing annual spectacle in America , a two-sided chess match is not only promised but guaranteed . The only question about Walsh and Wyche is which of them is wormier with ideas . Their imaginations are so active that the very canons of the sport are under strain . The National Football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the beginning of time running out , or at least since the onset of two-minute warnings , got to puzzling over why even sluggish teams always seem able to move the ball at game 's end . Increasingly , he has had the Bengals operating in a hurry-up mode from the start , dispensing with huddles , relying on sinister ( defined : left-handed ) quarterback Norman ( " Boomer " ) Esiason to communicate the plans aloud in a complicated tongue . The effect has been to freeze the other team 's situation specialists on the sidelines or create a confusion of too many men on the field . <P> Two games ago , however , the Seattle Seahawks started swooning on third downs , and last week Buffalo coach Marv Levy suggested his Bills might also feign strategic injuries in the American Conference championship game . Fearing a sham , commissioner Pete Rozelle issued a fuzzy decree on " the spirit of the rules " and momentarily turned Wyche 's ingenuity into an offsetting penalty . Cincinnati beat Buffalo anyway , 21-10 , but the theme of Super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. press corps at the Moscow summit , will be concerned with ethics . <P> All the fancy stuff aside , Cincinnati is as rugged a team as has ever employed a passer named Norman , a runner named Elbert and a linebacker from Dartmouth who serves on the Cincinnati city council . Councilman Reggie Williams does boast a salty tattoo on one bulging forearm , depicting a piece of music . " It 's a crescendo , " he says . " You have to have a certain rhythm in your life . " While scoring 18 touchdowns , rookie Elbert ( " Ickey " ) Woods has smoothed the black edge off several unenlightened symbols that have crept into currency in Cincinnati . Fans have taken to calling the stadium " the Jungle , " and throughout the games they chant like a minstrel chorus , " Who dey think gon na beat dem Bengals ? " Ickey 's popular touchdown " shuffle " would be the last straw were it not so preposterously white that it somehow saves the day .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
