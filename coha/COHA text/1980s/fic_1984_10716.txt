be a fast one , and expensive  --  offhand , Rincewind could n't think of any horse-dealer he knew who was rich enough to give change out of almost a whole ounce of gold . And then , of course , the other five coins would help him set up a useful practice at some safe distance , say two hundred miles . That would be the sensible thing . But what would happen to Twoflower , all alone in a city where even the cockroaches had an unerring instinct for gold ? A man would have to be a real heel to leave him . The Patrician of Ankh-Morpork smiled , but with his mouth only . The Hub Gate , you say ? ' he murmured . The guard captain saluted smartly . Aye , lord . We had to shoot the horse before he would stop . ' Which , by a fairly direct route , brings you here , ' said the Patrician , looking down at Rincewind . And what have you got to say for yourself ? ' It was rumoured that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with clerks who spent their days collating and updating all the information collected by their master 's exquisitely organised spy system . Rincewind did n't doubt it . He glanced towards the balcony that ran down one side of the audience room . A sudden run , a nimble jump  --  a sudden hail of crossbow quarrels . He shuddered . The Patrician cradled his chins in a beringed hand , and regarded the wizard with eyes as small and hard as beads . Let me see , ' he said . Oathbreaking , the theft of a horse , uttering false coinage  --  yes , I think it 's the Arena for you , Rincewind . ' This was too much . ' I did n't steal the horse ! I bought it fairly ! ' But with false coinage . Technical theft , you see . ' But those rhinu are solid gold ! ' Rhinu ? ' The Patrician rolled one of them around in his thick fingers . ' Is that what they are called ? How interesting . But , as you point out , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course they 're not  --  ' ' Ah ! you admit it , then ? ' Rincewind opened his mouth to speak , thought better of it , and shut it again.  |p21Quite  so . And on top of these there is , of course , the moral obloquyattendant on the cowardly betrayal of a visitor to this shore . For shame , Rincewind ! ' The Patrician waved a hand vaguely . The guards behind Rincewindbacked away , and their captain took a few paces to the right . Rincewind suddenly felt very alone . It is said that when a wizard is about to die Death himself turns up to claim him ( instead of delegating the task to a subordinate , such as Disease or Famine , as is usually the case ) . Rincewind looked around nervously for a tall figure in black ( wizards , even failed wizards , have in addition to rods and cones in their eyeballs the tiny octagons that enable them to see into the far octarine , the basic colour of which all other colours are merely pale shadows impinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of fluorescent greenishyellowpurple . ) Was that a flickering shadow in the corner ? Of course , ' said the Patrician , I could be merciful . ' The shadow disappeared . Rincewind looked up , an expression of insane hope on his face . Yes ? ' he said . The Patrician waved a hand again . Rincewind saw the guards leave the chamber . Alone with the overlord of the twin cities , he almost wished they would come back . Come hither , Rincewind , ' said the Patrician . He indicated a bowl of savouries on a low onyx table by the throne . Would you care for a crystallised jellyfish ? No ? ' Um , ' said Rincewind , no . ' Now I want you to listen very carefully to what I am about to say , ' said the Patrician amiably , otherwise you will die . In an interestingfashion . Over a period . Please stop fidgeting like that . Since you are a wizard of sorts , you are of course aware that we live upon a world shaped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is said to exist , towards the far rim , a continent which though small is equal in weight to all the mighty landmasses in this hemi-circle ? And that this , according to ancient legend , is because it is largely made of gold ? ' Rincewind nodded . Who had n't heard of the Counterweight Continent ? Some sailors even believed the childhood tales and sailed in search of it . Of course , they returned either empty handed or not atp22all . Probably eaten by giant turtles , in the opinion of more serious mariners . Because , of course , the Counterweight Continent was nothing more than a solar myth . It does , of course , exist , ' said the Patrician . Although it is not made of gold , it is true that gold is a very common metal there . Most of the mass is made up by vast deposits of octiron deep within the crust . Now it will be obvious to an incisive mind like yours that the existence of the Counterweight Continent poses a deadly threat to our people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open mouth . He sighed . He said , ' Do you by some chance fail to follow me ? ' Yang , ' said Rincewind . He swallowed , and licked his lips . I mean , no . I mean  --  well , gold .. I see , ' said the Patrician sweetly . You feel , perhaps , that it would be a marvellous thing to go to the Counterweight Continent and bring back a shipload of gold ? ' Rincewind had a feeling that some sort of trap was being set . Yes ? ' he ventured . And if every man on the shores of the Circle Sea had a mountain of gold of his own ? Would that be a good thing ? What would happen ? Think carefully . ' Rincewind 's brow furrowed . He thought . We 'd all be rich ? ' The way the temperature fell at his remark told him that it was not the correct one . I may as well tell you , Rincewind , that there is some contact between the Lords of the Circle Sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is styled , ' the Patrician went on . It is only very slight . There is little common ground between us . We have nothing they want , and they have nothing we can afford . It is an old Empire , Rincewind . Old and cunning and cruel and very , very rich . So we exchange fraternal greetings by albatross mail . At infrequent intervals . One such letter arrived this morning . A subject of the Emperor appears to have taken it into his head to visit our city . It appears he wishes to look at it . Only a madman would possibly undergo all the privations of crossing the Turnwise Ocean in order to merely look at anything . However . He landed this morning . He might have met a great hero , or the cunningest of thieves , or some wise and great sage . He met you . He has employed you as a guide . You will be a guide , Rincewind , to thisp23looker , this Twoflower . You will see that he returns home with a good report of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' Er . Thank you , Lord , ' said Rincewind miserably . There is another point , of course . It would be a tragedy should anything untoward happen to our little visitor . It would be dreadful if he were to die , for example . Dreadful for the whole of our land , because the Agatean Emperor looks after his own and could certainlyextinguish us at a nod . A mere nod . And that would be dreadfulfor you , Rincewind , because in the weeks that remained before the Empire 's huge mercenary fleet arrived certain of my servants would occupy themselves about your person in the hope that the avenging captains , on their arrival , might find their anger tempered by the sight of your still-living body . There are certain spells that can prevent the life departing from a body , be it never so abused , and  --  I see by your face that understanding dawns ? ' ' Yarrg . ' I beg your pardon ? ' Yes , lord . I 'll , er , see to it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well , I 'll try to look after him and see he comes to no harm . ' And after that I 'll get a job juggling snowballs through Hell , he added bitterly in the privacy of his own skull . Capital ! I gather already that you and Twoflower are on the best of terms . An excellent beginning . When he returns safely to his homeland you will not find me ungrateful . I shall probably even dismiss the charges against you . Thank you , Rincewind . You may go . Rincewind decided not to ask for the return of his five remaining rhinu . He backed away , cautiously . Oh , and there is one other thing , ' the Patrician said , as the wizard groped for the door handles . Yes , lord ? ' he replied , with a sinking heart . ' I 'm sure you wo n't dream of trying to escape from your obligationsby fleeing the city . I judge you to be a born city person . But you may be sure that the lords of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I assure you the thought never even crossed my mind , lord . ' Indeed ? Then if I were you I 'd sue my face for slander . '  |p24Rincewind  reached the Broken Drum at a dead run , and was just in time to collide with a man who came out backwards , fast . The stranger 's haste was in part accounted for by the spear in his chest . He bubbled noisily and dropped dead at the wizard 's feet . Rincewind peered around the doorframe and jerked back as a heavy throwing axe whirred past like a partridge . It was probably a lucky throw , a second cautious glance told him . The dark interior of the Drum was a broil of fighting men , quite a number of them  --  a third and longer glance confirmed  --  in bits . Rincewind swayed back as a wildly thrown stool sailed past and smashed on the far side of the street . Then he dived in . He was wearing a dark robe , made darker by constant wear and irregular washings . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that shuffled desperately from table to table . At one point a fighter , staggering back , trod on what felt like fingers . A number of what felt like teeth bit his ankle . He yelped shrilly and dropped his guard just sufficiently for a sword , swung by a surprised opponent , to skewer him . Rincewind reached the stairway , sucking his bruised hand and running with a curious , bent-over gait . A crossbow quarrel thunked into the banister rail above him , and he gave a whimper . He made the stairs in one breathless rush , expecting at any momentanother , more accurate shot . In the corridor above he stood upright , gasping , and saw the floor in front of him scattered with bodies . A big black-bearded man , with a bloody sword in one hand , was trying a door handle . Hey ! ' screamed Rincewind . The man looked around and then , almost absent-mindedly , drew a short throwing knife from his bandolierand hurled it . Rincewind ducked . There was a brief scream behind him as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clutched at his throat . The big man was already reaching for another knife . Rincewind looked around wildly , and then with wild improvisation drew himself up into a wizardly pose . His hand was flung back . Asoniti ! Kyorucha ! Beazleblor ! ' The man hesitated , his eyes flicking nervously from side to side as he waited for the magic . The conclusion that there was not going to be any hit him at the same time as Rincewind , whirring wildly down the passage , kicked him sharply in the groin.  |p25As  he screamed and clutched at himself the wizard dragged open the door , sprang inside , slammed it behind him and threw his body against it , panting . It was quiet in here . There was Twoflower , sleeping peacefully on the low bed . And there , at the foot of the bed , was the Luggage . Rincewind took a few steps forward , cupidity moving him as easilyas if he were on little wheels . The chest was open . There were bags inside , and in one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greed overcame caution , and he reached out gingerly .. . but what was the use ? He 'd never live to enjoy it . Reluctantly he drew his hand back , and was surprised to see a slight tremor in the chest 's open lid . Had n't it shifted slightly , as though rocked by the wind ? Rincewind looked at his fingers , and then at the lid . It looked heavy , and was bound with brass bands . It was quite still now . What wind ? Rincewind ! ' Twoflower sprang off the bed . The wizard jumped back , wrenchinghis features into a smile . My dear chap , right on time ! We 'll just have lunch , and then I 'm sure you 've got a wonderful programme lined up for this afternoon ! ' Er --  ' That 's great ! ' Rincewind took a deep breath . Look , ' he said desperately , let 's eat somewhere else . There 's been a bit of a fight down below . ' A tavern brawl ? Why did n't you wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  what ? ' I thought I made myself clear this morning , Rincewind . I want to see genuine Morporkian life  --  the slave market , the Whore Pits , the Temple of Small Gods , the Beggars ' Guild . . . and a genuine tavernbrawl . ' A faint note of suspicion entered Twofiower 's voice . You do have them , do n't you ? You know , people swinging on chandelier , swordfights over the table , the sort of thing Hrun the Barbarian and the Weasel are always getting involved in . You know  --  excitement . ' Rincewind sat down heavily on the bed . You want to see a fight ? ' he said . Yes . What 's wrong with that ? ' For a start , people get hurt . ' Oh , I was n't suggesting we get involved . I just want to see one ,  |p26that  's all . And some of your famous heroes . You do have some , do n't you ? It 's not all dockside talk ? ' And now , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yeah . We have them all right , ' said Rincewind hurriedly . He pictured them in his mind , and recoiled from the thought . All the heroes of the Circle Sea passed through the gates of AnkhMorporksooner or later . Most of them were from the barbaric tribes nearer the frozen Hub , which had a sort of export trade in heroes . Almost all of them had crude magic swords , whose unsuppressed harmonics on the astral plane played hell with any delicate experimentsin applied sorcery for miles around , but Rincewind did n't object to them on that score . He knew himself to be a magical dropout , so it did n't bother him that the mere appearance of a hero at the city gates was enough to cause retorts to explode and demons to materialise all through the Magical Quarter . No , what he did n't like about heroes was that they were usually suicidally gloomy when sober and homicidally insane when drunk . There were too many of them , too . Some of the most notable questing grounds near the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk of organising a rota . He rubbed his nose . The only heroes he had much time for were Bravd and the Weasel , who were out of town at the moment , and Hrun the Barbarian , who was practically an academic by Hub standardsin that he could think without moving his lips . Hrun was said to be roving somewhere Turnwise . Look , ' he said at last . Have you ever met a barbarian ? ' Twoflower shook his head . I was afraid of that , ' said Rincewind . Well , they 're  --  ' There was a clatter of running feet in the street outside and a fresh uproar from downstairs . It was followed by a commotion on the stairs . The door was flung open before Rincewind could collect himselfsufficiently to make a dash for the window . But instead of the greed-crazed madman he expected , he found himself looking into the round red face of a Sergeant of the Watch . He breathed again . Of course . The Watch were always careful not to intervene too soon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their favour . The job carried a pension , and attracted a cautious , thoughtful kind of man.  |p27The  Sergeant glowered at Rincewind , and then peered at Twoflowerwith interest . Everything all right here , then ? ' he said . Oh , fine , ' said Rincewind . Got held up , did you ? ' The sergeant ignored him . This the foreigner , then ? ' he inquired . We were just leaving , ' said Rincewind quickly , and switched to Trob . Twoflower , I think we ought to get lunch somewhere else . I know some places . ' He marched out into the corridor with as much aplomb as he could muster . Twoflower followed , and a few seconds later there was a strangling sound from the sergeant as the Luggage closed its lid with a snap , stood up , stretched , and marched after them . Watchmen were dragging bodies out of the room downstairs . There were no survivors . The Watch had ensured this by giving them ample time to escape via the back door , a neat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who are all these men ? ' said Twoflower . Oh , you know . Just men , ' said Rincewind . And before he could stop himself some part of his brain that had nothing to do took control of his mouth and added , Heroes , in fact . ' Really ? ' When one foot is stuck in the Grey Miasma of H'rull it is much easier to step right in and sink rather than prolong the struggle . Rincewind let himself go . Yes , that one over there is Erig Stronginthearm , over there is Black Zenell  --  ' Is Hrun the Barbarian here ? ' said Twoflower , looking around eagerly . Rincewind took a deep breath . That 's him behind us , ' he said . The enormity of this lie was so great that its ripples did in fact spread out one of the lower astral planes as far as the Magical Quarteracross the river , where it picked up tremendous velocity from the huge standing wave of power that always hovered there and bounced wildly across the Circle Sea . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of gnolls on a crumbling ledge high in the Caderack Mountains , and caused him a moment 's unexplained discomfort . Twoflower , meanwhile , had thrown back the lid of the Luggage and was hastily pulling out a heavy black cube.  |p28This  is fantastic ! ' he said . They 're never going to believe this at home ! ' What 's he going on about ? ' said the sergeant doubtfully . He 's pleased you rescued us , ' said Rincewind . He looked sidelongat the black box , half expecting it to explode or emit strange musicaltones . ' Ah , ' said the sergeant . He was staring at the box , too . Twoflower smiled brightly at them . ' I 'd like a record of the event , ' he said . Do you think you could ask them all to stand over by the window , please ? This wo n't take a moment . And , er , Rincewind ? ' ' Yes ? ' Twoflower stood on tiptoe to whisper . I expect you know what this is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box . It had a round glass eye protrudingfrom the centre of one face , and a lever at the back . Not wholly , ' he said . It 's a device for making pictures quickly , ' said Twoflower . Quite a new invention . I 'm rather proud of it but , look , I do n't think these gentlemen would  --  well , I mean they might be  --  sort of apprehensive ? Could you explain it to them ? I 'll reimburse them for their time , of course . ' He 's got a box with a demon in it that draws pictures , ' said Rincewindshortly . Do what the madman says and he will give you gold . ' The Watch smiled nervously . I 'd like you in the picture , Rincewind . That 's fine . ' Twoflower took out the golden disc that Rincewind had noticed before , squinted at its unseen face for a moment , muttered Thirty seconds should about do it , ' and said brightly , Smile please ! ' Smile , ' rasped Rincewind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' High above the disc the second albatross soared ; so high in fact that its tiny mad orange eyes could see the whole of the world and the great , glittering , girdling Circle Sea . There was a yellow message capsule strapped to one leg . Far below it , unseen in the clouds , the bird that had brought the earlier message to the Patrician of AnkhMorporkflapped gently back to its home.  |p29Rincewind  looked at the tiny square of glass in astonishment . There he was , all right  --  a tiny figure , in perfect colour , standing in front of a group of Watchmen whose faces were each frozen in a terrified rictus . A buzz of wordless terror went up from the men around him as they craned over his shoulder to look . Grinning , Twoflower produced a handful of the smaller coins Rincewind now recognised as quarter-rhinu . He winked at the wizard . I had similar problems when I stopped over in the Brown Islands , ' he said . They thought the iconograph steals a bit of their souls . Laughable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rincewind and then , because somehow that was hardly enough to keep up his side of the conversation , added , I do n't think it looks very like me , though . ' It 's easy to operate , ' said Twoflower , ignoring him . Look , all you have to do is press this button . The iconograph does the rest . Now , I 'll just stand over here next to Hrun , and you can take the picture . ' The coins quietened the men 's agitation in the way that gold can , and Rincewind was amazed to find , half a minute later , that he was holding a little glass portrait of Twoflower wielding a huge notched sword and smiling as though all his dreams had come true . They lunched at a small eating-house near the Brass Bridge , with the Luggage nestling under the table . The food and wine , both far superior to Rincewind 's normal fare , did much to relax him . Things were n't going to be too bad , he decided . A bit of invention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed . Twoflower seemed to be thinking too . Looking reflectively into his wine cup he said , Tavern fights are pretty common around here , I expect ? ' Oh , fairly . ' No doubt fixtures and fittings get damaged ? ' ' Fixt  --  oh , I see . You mean like benches and whatnot . Yes , I supposeso . ' That must be upsetting for the innkeepers . '  |p30I  've never really thought about it . I suppose it must be one of the risks of the job . ' Twoflower regarded him thoughtfully . I might be able to help there , ' he said . Risks are my business . I say , this food is a bit greasy , is n't it ? ' You did say you wanted to try some typical Morporkean food , ' said Rincewind . What was that about risks ? ' ' Oh , I know all about risks . They 're my business . ' ' I thought that 's what you said . I did n't believe it the first time either . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most exciting thing that happened to me was knocking some ink over . I assess risks . Day after day . Do you know what the odds are against a house catching fire in the Red Triangle district of Bes Pelargic ? Five hundred and thirtyeightto one . I calculated that , ' he added with a trace of pride . What  --  ' Rincewind tried to suppress a burp  --  ' what for ? ' Scuse me . ' He helped himself to some more wine . For  --  ' Twoflower paused . I ca n't say it in Trob , ' he said . ' I do n't think the beTrobi have a word for it . In my language we call it  --  ' he said a collection of outlandish syllables . Inn-sewer-ants , ' repeated Rincewind . Tha 's a funny word . Wossitmean ? ' Well , suppose you have a ship loaded with , say , gold bars . It might run into storms or , or be taken by pirates . You do n't want that to happen , so you take out an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cargo being lost , based on weather reports and piracy records for the last twenty years , then I add a bit , then youpay me some money based on those odds  --  '  --  and the bit  --  ' Rincewind said , waggling a finger solemnly .  --  and then , if the cargo is lost , I reimburse you . ' Reeburs ? ' Pay you the value of your cargo , ' said Twoflower patiently . ' I get it . It 's like a bet , right ? ' A wager ? In a way , I suppose . ' And you make money at this inn-sewer-ants ? ' It offers a return on investment , certainly . ' Wrapped in the warm yellow glow of the wine , Rincewind tried to think of inn-sewer-ants in Circle Sea terms.  |p31I  do n't think I unnerstan ' this inn-sewer-ants , ' he said firmly , idly watching the world spin by . Magic , now . Magic I unnerstan ' . ' Twoflower grinned . Magic is one thing , and **39;12576;TOOLONG another , ' he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' you used , ' said Rincewind impatiently . **38;12617;TOOLONG ? ' Never heard o ' it . ' Twoflower tried to explain . Rincewind tried to understand . In the long afternoon they toured the city Turnwise of the river . Twoflower led the way , with the strange picture-box slung on a strap round his neck . Rincewind trailed behind , whimpering at intervals and checking to see that his head was still there . A few others followed , too . In a city where public executions , duels , fights , magical feuds and strange events regularly punctuated the daily round the inhabitants has brought the profession of interestedbystander to a peak of perfection . They were , to a man , highly skilled gawpers . In any case , Twoflower was delightedly taking pictureafter picture of people engaged in what he described as typical activities , and since a quarter-rhinu would subsequently change hands for their trouble ' a tail of bemused and happy nouveaux-riches was soon following him in case this madman exploded in a shower of gold . At the Temple of the Seven-Handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed that the hundredspanhigh statue of Sek was altogether too holy to be made into a magic picture , but a payment of two rhinu left them astoundedly agreeing that perhaps He was n't as holy as all that . A prolonged session at the Whore Pits produced a number of colourful and instructive pictures , a number of which Rincewind concealed about his person for detailed perusal in private . As the fumes cleared from his brain he began to speculate seriously as to how the iconograph worked . Even a failed wizard knew that some substances were sensitive to light . Perhaps the glass plates were treated by some arcane processp32that froze the light that passed through them ? Something like that , anyway . Rincewind often suspected that there was something , somewhere , that was better than magic . He was usually disappointed . However , he soon took every opportunity to operate the box . Twoflowerwas only too pleased to allow this , since that enabled the little man to appear in his own pictures . It was at this point that Rincewindnoticed something strange . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wielder  --  which was that anyone , confronted with the hypnotic glass eye , would submissively obey the most peremptoryorders about stance and expression . It was while he was thus engaged in the Plaza of Broken Moon that disaster struck . Twoflower had posed alongside a bewildered charm-seller , his crowd of new-found admirers watching him with interest in case h did something humorously lunatic . Rincewind got down on one knee , the better to arrange the picture , and pressed the enchanted lever . The box said , It 's no good . I 've run out of pink . ' A hitherto unnoticed door opened in front of his eyes . A small , green and hideously warty humanoid figure leaned out , pointed at a colour-encrusted palette in one clawed hand , and screamed at him . No pink ! See ? ' screeched the homunculus . No good you going on pressing the lever when there 's no pink , is there ? If you wanted pink you should n't of took all those pictures of young ladies , should you ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alright . Yeah . Sure , ' said Rincewind . In one dim corner of the little box he thought he could see an easel , and a tiny unmade bed . He hoped he could n't . So long as that 's understood , ' said the imp , and shut the door . Rincewind thought he could hear the muffled sound of grumbling and the scrape of a stool being dragged across the floor . Twoflower  --  ' he began , and looked up . Twoflower had vanished . As Rincewind stared at the crowd , with sensations of prickly horror travelling up his spine , there came a gentle prod in the small of his back . Turn without haste , ' said a voice like black silk . Or kiss your kidneys goodbye . ' The crowd watched with interest . It was turning out to be quite a good day.  |p33Rincewind  turned slowly , feeling the point of the sword scrape along his ribs . At the other end of the blade he recognised Stren Withel  --  thief , cruel swordsman , disgruntled contender for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he said weakly . A few yards away he noticed a couple of unsympathetic men raising the lid of the Luggage and pointing excitedlyat the bags of gold . Withel smiled . It made an unnerving effect on his scar-crossed face . I know you , ' he said . A gutter wizard . What is that thing ? ' Rincewind became aware that the lid of the Luggage was tremblingslightly , although there was no wind . And he was still holding the picture-box . This ? It makes pictures , ' he said brightly . Hey , just hold that smile , will you ? ' He backed away quickly and pointed the box . For a moment Withel hesitated . What ? ' he said . That 's fine , hold it just like that . . . ' said Rincewind . The thief paused , then growled and swung his sword back . There was a snap , and a duet of horrible screams . Rincewind didnot glance around for fear of the terrible things he might see , and bythe time Withel looked for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still accelerating . The albatross descended in wide , slow sweeps that ended in an undignifiedflurry of feathers and a thump as it landed heavily on its platform in the Patrician 's bird garden . The custodian of the birds , dozing in the sun and hardly expecting a long-distance message so soon after this morning 's arrival , jerked to his feet and looked up . A few moments later he was scuttling through the palace 's corridorsholding the message capsule and  --  owing to carelessness brought on by surprise  --  sucking at the nasty beak wound on the back of his hand . Rincewind pounded down an alley , paying no heed to the screams of rage coming from the picture box , and cleared a high wall with his frayed robe flapping around him like the feathers of a dishevelled jackdaw . He landed in the forecourt of a carpet shop , scattering thep34merchandise and customers , dived through its rear exit trailing apologies , skidded down another alley and stopped , teetering dangerously , just as he was about to plunge unthinkingly into the Ankh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which can steal a man 's life away . After its turbid passage through the twin cities the Ankh could have been one of them . In the distance the cries of rage took on a shrill note of terror . Rincewind looked around desperately for a boat , or a handhold up the sheer walls on either side of him . He was trapped . Unbidden , the Spell welled up in his mind . It was perhaps untrue to say that he had learned it ; it had learned him . The episode had led to his expulsion from Unseen University , because , for a bet , he had dared to open the pages of the last remaining copy of the Creator 's own grimoire , the Octavo ( while the University librarian was otherwiseengaged ) . The spell had leapt out of the page and instantly burrowed deeply into his mind , from whence even the combined talents of the Faculty of Medicine had been unable to coax it . Preciselywhich one it was they were also unable to ascertain , except that it was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fabric of time and space itself . Since then it had been showing a worrying tendency , when Rincewindwas feeling rundown or especially threatened , to try to get itself said . He clenched his teeth together but the first syllable forced itself around the corner of his mouth . His left hand raised involuntarily and , as the magical force whirled him round , began to give off octarine sparks . . . The Luggage hurtled around the corner , its several hundred knees moving like pistons . Rincewind gaped . The spell died , unsaid . The box did n't appear to be hampered in any way by the ornamentalrug draped roguishly over it , nor by the thief hanging by one arm from the lid . It was , in a very real sense , a dead weight . Further along the lid were the remains of two fingers , owner unknown . The Luggage halted a few feet from the wizard and , after a moment , retracted its legs . It had no eyes that Rincewind could see , but he was nevertheless sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said weakly . It did n't budge , but the lid creaked open , releasing the dead thief . Rincewind remembered about the gold . Presumably the box had to have a master . In the absence of Twoflower , had it adopted him ? The tide was turning and he could see debris drifting downstream in the yellow afternoon light towards the River Gate , a mere hundred yards downstream . It was the work of a moment to let the dead thief join them . Even if it was found later it would hardly cause comment . And the sharks in the estuary were used to solid , regular meals . Rincewind watched the body drift away , and considered his next move . The Luggage would probably float . All he had to do was wait until dusk , and then go out with the tide . There were plenty of wild places downstream where he could wade ashore , and then  --  well , if the Patrician really had sent out word about him then a change of clothing and a shave should take care of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had a facility for languages . Let him but get to Chimera or Gonim or Ecalpon and half a dozen armies could n't bring him back . And then  --  wealth , comfort , security . . . There was , of course , the problem of Twoflower . Rincewind allowed himself a moment 's sadness . It could be worse , ' he said by way of farewell . ' It could be me . ' It was when he tried to move that he found his robe was caught on some obstruction . By craning his neck he found that the edge of it was being gripped firmly by the Luggage 's lid . Ah , Gorphal , ' said the Patrician pleasantly . Come in . Sit down . Can I press you to a candied starfish ? ' I am yours to command , master , ' said the old man calmly . Save , perhaps , in the matter of preserved echinoderms . ' The Patrician shrugged , and indicated the scroll on the table . Read that , ' he said . Gorphal picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the familiar ideograms of the Golden Empire . He read in silence for perhaps a minute , and then turned the scroll over to examine minutely the seal on the obverse.  |p36You  are famed as a student of Empire affairs , ' said the Patrician . Can you explain this ? ' Knowledge in the matter of the Empire lies less in noting particularevents than in studying a certain cast of mind , ' said the old diplomat . The message is curious , yes , but not surprising . ' This morning the Emperor instructed , ' the Patrician allowed himselfthe luxury of a scowl , instructed me , Gorphal , to protect this Two Flower person . Now it seems I must have him killed . You do n't find that surprising ? ' No . The Emperor is no more than a boy . He is  --  idealistic . Keen . A god to his people . Whereas this afternoon 's letter is , unless I am very much mistaken , from Nine Turning Mirrors , the Grand Vizier . He has grown old in the service of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiresome ingredient in the successful running of the Empire . He does not like things out of place . The Empire was not built by allowing things to get out of place . That is his view . ' I begin to see  --  ' said the Patrician . Quite so . ' Gorphal smiled into his beard . This tourist is a thing that is out of place . After acceding to his master 's wishes Nine TurningMirrors would , I am quite sure , make his own arrangements with a view to ensuring that one wanderer would not be allowed to return home bringing , perhaps , the disease of dissatisfaction . The Empire likes people to stay where it puts them . So much more convenient , then , if this Two Flower disappears for good in the barbarian lands . Meaning here , master . ' And your advice ? ' said the Patrician . Gorphal shrugged . Merely that you should do nothing . Matters will undoubtedly resolve themselves . However , ' he scratched an ear thoughtfully , ' perhaps the Assassins ' Guild . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Assassins ' Guild . Who is their president at the moment ? ' Zlorf Flannelfoot , master . ' Have a word with him , will you ? ' Quite so , master . ' The Patrician nodded . It was all rather a relief . He agreed with Nine Turning Mirrors  --  life was difficult enough . People ought to stay where they were put.  |p37Brilliant  constellations shone down on the discworld . One by one the traders shuttered their shops . One by one the gonophs , thieves , finewirers , whores , illusionists , backsliders and second-storey men awoke and breakfasted . Wizards went about their polydimensional affairs . Tonight saw the conjunction of two powerful planets , and already the air over the Magical Quarter was hazy with early spells . Look , ' said Rincewind , this is n't getting us anywhere . ' He inched sideways . The Luggage followed faithfully , lid half open and menacing . Rincewind briefly considered making a desperate leap to safety . The lid smacked in anticipation . In any case , he told himself with sinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had that dogged look about it . Even if he managed to get to a horse , he had a nasty suspicion that it would follow him at its own pace . Endlessly . Swimming rivers and oceans . Gaining slowly every night , while he had to stop to sleep . And then one day , in some exotic city and years hence , he 'd hear the sound of hundreds of tiny feet accelerating down the road behind him You 've got the wrong man ! ' he moaned . It 's not my fault ! I did n't kidnap him ! ' The box moved forward slightly . Now there was just a narrow strip of greasy jetty between Rincewind 's heels and the river . A flash of precognition told him that the box would be able to swim faster than he could . He tried not to imagine what it would be like to drown in the Ankh . It wo n't stop until you give in , you know , ' said a small voice conversationally . Rincewind looked down at the iconograph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the homunculus was leaning against the frame , smoking a pipe and watching the proceedings with amusement . I 'll take you in with me , at least , ' said Rincewind through gritted teeth . The imp took the pipe out of his mouth . What did you say ? ' he said . I said I 'll take you in with me , dammit ! '  |p38Suit  yourself . ' The imp tapped the side of the box meaningfully . We 'll see who sinks first . ' The Luggage yawned , and moved forward a fraction of an inch . Oh all right , ' said Rincewind irritably . But you 'll have to give me time to think . ' The Luggage backed off slowly . Rincewind edged his way back onto reasonably safe land and sat down with his back against a wall . Across the river the lights of Ankh city glowed . You 're a wizard , ' said the picture imp . You 'll think of some way to find him . ' Not much of a wizard , I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn them into worms , ' the imp added encouragingly , ignoring his last remark . No . Turning To Animals is an Eighth Level spell . I never even completed my training . I only know one spell . ' Well , that 'll do . ' I doubt it , ' said Rincewind hopelessly . What does it do , then ? ' Ca n't tell you . Do n't really want to talk about it . But frankly , ' he sighed , no spells are much good . It takes three months to commit even a simple one to memory , and then once you 've used it , pouf ! it 's gone . That 's what 's so stupid about the whole magic thing , you know . You spend twenty years learning the spell that makes nude virgins appear in your bedroom , and then you 're so poisoned by quicksilver fumes and half-blind from reading old grimoires that you ca n't remember what happens next . ' I never thought of it like that , ' said the imp . Hey , look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd got better kind of magic in the Empire I thought  --  I thought . . The imp looked at him expectantly . Rincewind cursed to himself . Well , if you must know , I thought he did n't mean magic . Not as such . ' What else is there , then ? ' Rincewind began to feel really wretched . I do n't know , ' he said . A better way of doing things , I suppose . Something with a bit of sense in it . Harnessing  --  harnessing the lightning , or something . ' The imp gave him a kind but pitying look . Lightning is the spears hurled by the thunder giants when theyp39fight , ' it said gently . Established meteorological fact . You ca n't harnessit . ' I know , ' said Rincewind miserably . That 's the flaw in the argument , of course . ' The imp nodded , and disappeared into the depths of the iconograph . A few moments later Rincewind smelled bacon frying . He waited until his stomach could n't stand the strain any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reappeared . I 've been thinking about what you said , ' it said before Rincewind could open his mouth . And even if you could get a harness on it , how could you get it to pull a cart ? ' What the hell are you talking about ? ' Lightning . It just goes up and down . You 'd want it to go along , not up and down . Anyway , it 'd probably burn through the harness . ' I do n't care about the lightning ! How can I think on an empty stomach ? ' Eat something , then . That 's logic . ' How ? Every time I move that damn box flexes its hinges at me ! ' The Luggage , on cue , gaped widely . See ? ' It 's not trying to bite you , ' said the imp . There 's food in there . You 're no use to it starved . ' Rincewind peered into the dark recesses of the Luggage . There were indeed , among the chaos of boxes and bags of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gave a cynical laugh , mooched around the abandoned jetty until he found a piece of wood about the right length , wedged it as politely as possible in the gap between the lid and the box , and pulled out one of the flat packages . It held biscuits that turned out to be as hard as diamondwood. " loody ' ell , ' he muttered , nursing his teeth . Captain Eightpanther 's Travellers ' Digestives , them , ' said the imp from the doorway to his box . Saved many a life at sea , they have . ' ' Oh , sure . Do you use them as a raft , or just throw them to the sharks and sort of watch them sink ? What 's in the bottles ? Poison ? ' Water . ' But there 's water everywhere ! Why 'd he want to bring water ? ' Trust . ' Trust ? ' Yes . That 's what he did n't , the water here . See ? '  |p40Rincewind  opened a bottle . The liquid inside might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no trace of life . Neither taste nor smell , ' he grumbled . The Luggage gave a little creak , attracting his attention . With a lazy air of calculated menace it shut its lid slowly , grinding Rincewind'simpromptu wedge like a dry loaf . All right , all right , ' he said . I 'm thinking . ' Ymor 's headquarters were in the Leaning Tower at the junction of Rime Street and Frost Alley . At midnight the solitary guard leaning in the shadows looked up at the conjoining planets and wondered idly what change in his fortunes they might herald . There was the faintest of sounds , as of a gnat yawning . The guard glanced down the deserted street , and now caught the glimmer of moonlight on something lying in the mud a few yards away . He picked it up . The lunar light gleamed on gold , and his intake of breath was almost loud enough to echo down the alleyway . There was a slight sound again , and another coin rolled into the gutter on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up there was another one , a little way off and still spinning . Gold was , he remembered , said to be formed from the crystallised light of stars . Until now he had never believed it to be true , that something as heavy as gold could fall naturally from the sky . As he drew level with the opposite alley mouth some more fell . It was still in its bag , there was an awful lot of it , and Rincewind brought it down heavily onto his head . When the guard came to he found himself looking up into the wild-eyed face of a wizard , who was menacing his throat with a sword . In the darkness , too , something was gripping his leg . It was the disconcerting sort of grip that suggested that the gripper could grip a whole lot harder , if he wanted to . Where is he , the rich foreigner ? ' hissed the wizard . Quickly ! ' What 's holding my leg ? ' said the man , with a note of terror in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased . You would n't want to know , ' said Rincewind . Pay attention , please . Where 's the foreigner ? ' Not here ! They 've got him at Broadman 's place ! Everyone 's look/ing for him ! You 're Rincewind , are n't you ? The box  --  the box that bites people  --  ononono . . . pleasssse .. Rincewind had gone . The guard felt the unseen leg-gripper release his  --  or , as he was beginning to fear , its  --  hold-Then , as he tried to pull himself to his feet , something big and heavy and square cannonedinto him out of the dark and plunged off after the wizard . Something with hundreds of tiny feet . With only his home-made phrase book to help him , Twoflower was trying to explain the mysteries of inn-sewer-ants to Broadman . The fat innkeeper was listening intently , his little black eyes glittering . From the other end of the table Ymor watched with mild amusement , occasionally feeding one of his ravens with scraps from his plate . Beside him Withel paced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Ymor , without taking his eyes from the two men opposite him . ' I can feel it , Stren . Who would dare attack us here ? And the gutter wizard will come . He 's too much of a cowardnot to . And he 'll try to bargain . And we shall have him . And the gold . And the chest . ' Withel 's one eye glared , and he smacked a fist into the palm of a black-gloved hand . Who would have thought there was so much sapient pearwood in the whole of the disc ? ' he said . ' How could we have known ? ' ' You fret too much , Stren . I 'm sure you can do better this time , ' said Ymor pleasantly . The lieutenant snorted in disgust , and strode off around the room to bully his men . Ymor carried on watching the tourist . It was strange , but the little man did n't seem to realise the seriousnessof his position . Ymor had on several occasions seen him look around the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been talking for ages to Broadman , and Ymor had seen a piece of paper change hands . And Broadman had given the foreigner some coins . It was strange . When Broadman got up and waddled past Ymor 's chair the thiefmaster'sarm shot out like a steel spring and grabbed the fat man by his apron . ' What was that all about , friend ? ' asked Ymor quietly . ' N-nothing , Ymor . Just private business , like . '  |p42There  are no secrets between friends , Broadman . ' Tar . Well , I 'm not sure about it myself , really . It 's a sort of bet , see ? ' said the innkeeper nervously . Inn-sewer-ants , it 's called . It 's like a bet that the Broken Drum wo n't get burned down . ' Ymor held the man 's gaze until Broadman twitched in fear and embarrassment . Then the thiefmaster laughed . This worm-eaten old tinder pile ? ' he said . The man must be mad ! ' Yes , but mad with money . He says now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins with a P , it 's what you might call the stake money  --  the people he works for in the Agatean Empire will pay up . If the Broken Drum burns down . Not that I hope it does . Burn down . The Broken Drum , I mean . I mean , it 's like a home to me , is the Drum .. Not entirely stupid , are you ? ' said Ymor , and pushed the innkeeperaway . The door slammed back on its hinges and thudded into the wall . Hey , that 's my door ! ' screamed Broadman . Then he realised who was standing at the top of the steps , and ducked behind the table a mere shaving of time before a short black dart sped across the room and thunked into the woodwork . Ymor moved his hand carefully , and poured out another flagon of beer . Wo n't you join me , Zlorf ? ' he said levelly . And put that sword away , Stren . Zlorf Flannelfoot is our friend . ' The president of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into its holster in one smooth movement . Stren ! ' said Ymor . The black-clad thief hissed , and sheathed his sword . But he kept his hand on the hilt , and his eyes on the assassin . That was n't easy . Promotion in the Assassins ' Guild was by competitiveexamination , the Practical being the most important  --  indeed , the only  --  part . Thus Zlorf 's broad , honest face was a welt of scar tissue , the result of many a close encounter . It probably had n't been all that good-looking in any case  --  it was said that Zlorf had chosen a profession in which dark hoods , cloaks and nocturnal prowlings figured largely because there was a day-fearing trollish streak in his parentage . People who said this in earshot of Zlorf tended to carry their ears home in their hats . He strolled down the stairs , followed by a number of assassins.  |p43When  he was directly in front of Ymor he said : I 've come for the tourist . ' Is it any of your business , Zlorf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Two of the assassins stepped forward . Then Stren was in front of them , his sword appearing to materialise an inch from their throats without having to pass through the intervening air . Possibly I could only kill one of you , ' he murmured , but I suggest you ask yourselves  --  which one ? ' Look up , Zlorf , ' said Ymor . A row of yellow , baleful eyes looked down from the darkness among the rafters . One step more and you 'll leave here with fewer eyeballs than you came with , ' said the thiefmaster . So sit down and have a drink , Zlorf , and let 's talk about this sensibly . I thought we had an agreement . You do n't rob  --  I do n't kill . Not for payment , that is , ' he added after a pause . Zlorf took the proffered beer . So ? ' he said . I 'll kill him . Then you rob him . Is he that funny looking one over there ? ' Yes . ' Zlorf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrugged . He seldom wasted time wondering why people wanted other people dead . It was just a living . Who is your client , may I ask ? ' said Ymor . Zlorf held up a hand . Please ! ' he protested . Professional eti-quette . ' Of course . By the way  --  ' Yes ? ' I believe I have a couple of guards outside  --  ' Had. : ' And some others in the doorway across the street  --  ' Formerly . ' And two bowmen on the roof . ' A flicker of doubt passed across Zlorf 's face , like the last shaft of sunlight over a badly ploughed field . The door flew open , badly damaging the assassin who was standing beside it . Stop doing that ! ' shrieked Broadman , from under his table.  |p44Zlorf  and Ymor stared up at the figure on the threshold . It was short , fat and richly dressed . Very richly dressed . There were a numberof tall , big shapes looming behind it . Very big , threatening shapes . ' Who 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said Ymor . ' His name 's Rerpf . He runs the GroaningPlatter tavern down by Brass Bridge . Stren  --  remove him . ' Rerpf held up a beringed hand . Stren Withel hesitated halfway to the door as several very large trolls ducked under the doorway and stood on either side of the fat man , blinking in the light . Muscles the size of melons bulged in forearms like floursacks . Each troll held a double-headed axe . Between thumb and forefinger . Broadman erupted from cover , his face suffused with rage . ' Out ! ' he screamed . ' Get those trolls out of here ! ' No-one moved . The room was suddenly quiet . Broadman looked around quickly . It began to dawn on him just what he had said , and to whom . A whimper escaped from his lips , glad to be free . He reached the doorway to his cellars just as one of the trolls , with a lazy flick of one ham-sized hand , sent his axe whirling across the room . The slam of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merged into one sound . ' Bloody hell ! ' exclaimed Zlorf Flannelfoot . ' What do you want ? ' said Ymor . ' I am here on behalf of the Guild of Merchants and Traders , ' said Rerpf evenly . ' To protect our interests , you might say . Meaning the little man . ' Ymor wrinkled his brows . ' I 'm sorry , ' he said . ' I thought I heard you say the Guild of Mer-chants ? ' ' And traders , ' agreed Rerpf . Behind him now , in addition to more trolls , were several humans that Ymor vaguely recognised . He had seen them , maybe , behind counters and bars . Shadowy figures , usually  --  easilyignored , easily forgotten . At the back of his mind a bad feeling began to grow . He thought about how it might be to be , say , a fox confronted with an angry sheep . A sheep , moreover , that could afford to employ wolves . ' How long has this  --  Guild  --  been in existence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this afternoon , ' said Rerpf . ' I 'm vice-guildmaster in charge of tourism , you know . '  |p45What  is this tourism of which you speak ? ' Uh  --  we are not quite sure . . . ' said Rerpf . An old bearded man poked his head over the guildmaster 's shoulder and cackled , ' Speakingon behalf of the winesellers of Morpork , Tourism means Business . See ? ' Well ? ' said Ymor coldly . Well , ' said Rerpf , we 're protecting our interests , like I said . ' Thieves OUT , Thieves OUT ! ' cackled his elderly companion . Severalothers took up the chant . Zlorf grinned . And assassins , ' chanted the old man . Zlorf growled . Stands to reason , ' said Rerpf . People robbing and murdering all over place , what sort of impression are visitors going to take away ? You come all the way to see our fine city with its many points of historical and civic interest , also many quaint customs , and you wake up dead in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ankh , how are you going to tell all your friends what a great time you 're having ? Let 's face it , you 've got to move with the times . ' Zlorf and Ymor met each other 's gaze . We have , have we ? ' said Ymor . Then let us move , brother , ' agreed Zlorf . In one movement he brought his blowgun to his mouth and sent a dart hissing towards the nearest troll . It spun around , hurling its axe , which whirred over the assassin 's head and buried itself in a luckless thief behind him . Rerpf ducked , allowing a troll behind him to raise its huge iron crossbow and fire a spear-length quarrel into the nearest assassin . That was the start .. . It has been remarked before that those who are sensitive to radiationsin the far octarine  --  the eighth colour , the pigment of the Imagination  --  cansee things that others can not . Thus it was that Rincewind , hurrying through the crowded , flarelitevening bazaars of Morpork with the Luggage trundling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deliver a few suitable curses , and beheld Death . It had to be Death . No-one else went around with empty eye sockets and , of course , the scythe over one shoulder was another clue . As Rincewind stared in horror a courting couple , laughing atp46some private joke , walked straight through the apparition without appearing to notice it . Death , insofar as it was possible in a face with no movable features , looked surprised . RINCEWIND ? Death said , in tones as deep and heavy as the slammingof leaden doors , far underground . Um , ' said Rincewind , trying to back away from that eyeless stare . BUT WHY ARE YOU HERE ? ( Boom , boom went crypt lids , in the worm-haunted fastnesses under old mountains . .. ) ' Urn , why not ? ' said Rincewind . Anyway , I 'm sure you 've got lots to do , so if you 'll just  --  ' I WAS SURPRISED THAT YOU JOSTLED ME , RINCEWIND , FOR I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THEE THIS VERY NIGHT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S SO BLOODY VEXING ABOUT THE WHOLE BUSINESS IS THAT I WAS EXPECTING TO MEET THEE IN PSEPHOPOLOLIS . But that 's five hundred miles away ! ' YOU DO N'T HAVE TO TELL ME . THE WHOLE SYSTEM 'S GOT SCREWED UP AGAIN , I CAN SEE THAT . LOOK , THERE 'S NO CHANCE OF YOU  --  ? Rincewind backed away , hands spread protectively in front of him . The dried fish salesman on a nearby stall watched this madman with interest . Not a chance ! ' I COULD LEND YOU A VERY FAST HORSE . No ! ' IT WO N'T HURT A BIT . No ! ' Rincewind turned and ran . Death watched him go , and shrugged bitterly soD You , THEN , Death said . He turned , and noticed the fish salesman . With a snarl Death reached out a bony finger and stopped the man 's heart , but he did n't take much pride in it . Then Death remembered what was due to happen later that night . It would not be true to say that Death smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a calcareous grin . But He hummed a little tune , cheery as a plague pit , and  --  pausing only to extract the life from a passing mayfly , and one-ninth of the lives fromp47a cat cowering under the fish stall ( all cats can see into the octarine )  --  Death turned on His heel and set off towards the Broken Drum . Short Street , Morpork , is in fact one of the longest in the city . FiligreeStreet crosses its turnwise end in the manner of the crosspiece of a T , and the Broken Drum is so placed that it looks down the full length of the street . At the furthermost end of Short Street a dark oblong rose on hundreds of tiny legs , and started to run . At first it moved at no more than a lumbering trot , but by the time it was halfway up the street it was moving arrow-fast . . . A darker shadow inched its way along one of the walls of the Drum , a few yards from the two trolls who were guarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faint clinking of the specially-preparedbags at his belt .. . One of the trolls tapped his colleague on the shoulder , producing a noise like two pebbles being knocked together . He pointed down the starlit street .. . Rincewind darted from his hiding place , turned , and hurled his burden through the Drum 's nearest window . Withel saw it arrive . The bag arced across the room , turning slowly in the air , and burst on the edge of a table . A moment later gold coins were rolling across the floor , spinning , glittering . The room was suddenly silent , save for the tiny noises of gold and the whimpers of the wounded . With a curse Withel despatched the assassin he had been fighting . It 's a trick ! ' he screamed . No-one move ! ' Three score men and a dozen trolls froze in mid-grope . Then , for the third time , the door burst open . Two trolls hurried through it , slammed it behind them , dropped the heavy bar across it and fled down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . And , for the last time , the door opened . In fact it exploded , the great wooden bar being hurled far across the room and the frame itself giving way . Door and frame landed on a table , which flew into splinters . It was then that the frozen fighters noticed that there was something else inp48the pile of wood . It was a box , shaking itself madly to free itself of the smashed timber around it . Rincewind appeared in the ruined doorway , hurling another of his gold grenades . It smashed into a wall , showering coins . Down in the cellar Broadman looked up , muttered to himself , and carried on with his work . His entire spindlewinter 's supply of candles had already been strewn on the floor , mixed with his store of kindling wood . Now he was attacking a barrel of lamp oil . Inn-sewer-ants , ' he muttered . Oil gushed out and swirled around his feet . Withel stormed across the floor , his face a mask of rage . Rincewind took careful aim and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gold . But now Ymor was shouting , and pointing an accusing finger . A raven swooped down from its perch in the rafters and dived at the wizard , talons open and gleaming . It did n't make it . At about the halfway point the Luggage leapt from its bed of splinters , gaped briefly in mid-air , and snapped shut . It landed lightly . Rincewind saw its lid open again , slightly . Just far enough for a tongue , large as a palm leaf , red as mahogany , to lick up a few errant feathers . At the same moment the giant candlewheel fell from the ceiling , plunging the room into gloom . Rincewind , coiling himself like a spring , gave a standing jump and grasped a beam , swinging himself up into the relative safety of the roof with a strength that amazed him . Exciting , is n't it ! ' said a voice by his ear . Down below , thieves , assassins , trolls and merchants all realised at about the same moment that they were in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , among the suddenlymenacing shapes in the semidarkness , that was absolutely horrible . As one they made for the door , but had two dozen different recollections of its exact position . High above the chaos Rincewind stared at Twoflower . Did you cut the lights down ? ' he hissed.  |p49Yes  . ' How come you 're up here ? ' I thought I 'd better not get in everyone 's way . ' Rincewind considered this . There did n't seem to be much he could say . Twoflower added : A real brawl ! Better than anything I 'd imagined ! Do you think I ought to thank them ? Or did you arrange it ? ' Rincewind looked at him blankly . I think we ought to be getting down now , ' he said hollowly . Everyone 's gone . ' He dragged Twoflower across the littered floor and up the steps . They burst out into the tail end of the night . There were still a few stars but the moon was down , and there was a faint grey glow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rincewind sniffed . Can you smell oil ? ' he said . Then Withel stepped out of the shadows and tripped him up . At the top of the cellar steps Broadman knelt down and fumbled in his tinderbox . It turned out to be damp . I 'll kill that bloody cat , ' he muttered , and groped for the spare box that was normally on the ledge by the door . It was missing . Broadman said a bad word . A lighted taper appeared in mid-air , right beside him . HERE , TAKE THIS . Thanks , ' said Broadman . DO N'T MENTION IT . Broadman went to throw the taper down the steps . His hand paused in mid-air . He looked at the taper , his brow furrowing . Then he turned around and held the taper up to illuminate the scene . It did n't shed much light , but it did give the darkness a shape .. . Oh , no  --  ' he breathed . BUT YES , said Death . Rincewind rolled . For a moment he thought Withel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was worse than that . He was waiting for him to get up . I see you have a sword , wizard , ' he said quietly . I suggest you rise , and we shall see how well you use it . '  |p50Rincewind  stood up as slowly as he dared , and drew from his belt the short sword he had taken from the guard a few hours and a hundred years ago . It was a short blunt affair compared to Withel 's hair-thin rapier . But I do n't know how to use a sword , ' he wailed . Good . ' You know that wizards ca n't be killed by edged weapons ? ' said Rincewind desperately . Withel smiled coldly . ' So I have heard , ' he said . I look forward to putting it to the test . ' He lunged . Rincewind caught the thrust by sheer luck , jerked his hand away in shock , deflected the second stroke by coincidence , and took the third one through his robe at heart-height . There was a clink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He drew the sword out and prodded again at the wizard , who was rigid with terror and guilt . There was another clink , and gold coins began to drop out of the hem of the wizard 's robe . So you bleed gold , do you ? ' hissed Withel . But have you got gold concealed in that raggedy beard , you little  --  ' As his sword went back for his final sweep the sullen glow that had been growing in the doorway of the Broken Drum flickered , dimmed , and erupted into a roaring fireball that sent the walls billowingoutward and carried the roof a hundred feet into the air before bursting through it , in a gout of red-hot tiles . Withel stared at the boiling flames , unnerved . And Rincewind leapt . He ducked under the thief 's sword arm and brought his own blade around in an arc so incompetently misjudged that it hit the man flat-first and jolted out of the wizard 's hand . Sparks and dropletsof flaming oil rained down as Withel reached out with both gauntleted hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You did this ! ' he screamed . You and your box of trickery ! ' His thumb found Rincewind 's windpipe . This is it , the wizard thought . Wherever I 'm going , it ca n't be worse than here . . . Excuse me , ' said Twoflower . Rincewind felt the grip lessen . And now Withel was slowly getting up , a look of absolute hatred on his face . A glowing ember landed on the wizard . He brushed it off hurriedly , and scrambled to his feet.  |p51Twoflower  was behind Withel , holding the man 's own needlesharpsword with the point resting in the small of the thief 's back . Rincewind 's eyes narrowed . He reached into his robe , then withdrew his hand bunched into a fist . Do n't move , ' he said . Am I doing this right ? ' asked Twoflower anxiously . He says he 'll skewer your liver if you move , ' Rincewind translated freely . ' I doubt it , ' said Withel . Bet ? ' No . ' As Withel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and caught the thief on the jaw . Withel stared at him in amazementfor a moment , and then quietly toppled into the mud . The wizard uncurled his stinging fist and the roll of gold coins slipped between his throbbing fingers . He looked down at the recumbentthief . Good grief , ' he gasped . He looked up and yelled as another ember landed on his neck . Flames were racing along the rooftops on either side of the street . All around him people were hurling possessions from windows and dragginghorses from smoking stables . Another explosion in the whitehotvolcano that was the Drum sent a whole marble mantlepiece scything overhead . The Widdershin Gate 's the nearest ! ' Rincewind shouted above the crackle of collapsing rafters . Come on ! ' He grabbed Twoflower 's reluctant arm and dragged him down the street . ' My Luggage  --  ' Blast your luggage ! Stay here much longer and you 'll go where you do n't need luggage ! Come on ! ' screamed Rincewind . They jogged on through the crowd of frightened people leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawn air . Somethingwas puzzling him . I 'm sure all the candles went out , ' he said . So how did the Drum catch fire ? ' I do n't know , ' moaned Twoflower . It 's terrible , Rincewind . We were getting along so well , too . '  |p52Rincewind  stopped in astonishment , so that another refugee cannonedinto him and spun away with an oath . Getting on ? ' ' Yes , a great bunch of fellows , I thought  --  language was a bit of a problem , but they were so keen for me to join their party , they just would n't take no for an answer  --  really friendly people , I thoughtRincewind started to correct him , then realised he did n't know how to begin . ' It 'll be a blow for old Broadman , ' Twoflower continued . ' Still , he was wise . I 've still got the rhinu he paid as his first premium . ' Rincewind did n't know the meaning of the word premium , but his mind was working fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' You bet Broadman it would n't catch fire ? ' ' Oh yes . Standard valuation . Two hundred rhinu . Why do you ask ? ' Rincewind turned and stared at the flames racing towards them , and wondered how much of Ankh-Morpork could be bought for two hundred rhinu . Quite a large piece , he decided . Only not now , not the way those flames were moving . . . He glanced down at the tourist . ' You  --  ' he began , and searched his memory for the worst word in the Trob tongue ; the happy little beTrobi did n't really know how to swear properly . ' You , ' he repeated . Another hurrying figure bumped into him , narrowlymissing him with the blade over its shoulder . Rincewind 's tortured temper exploded . ' You little ( such a one who , while wearing a copper nose ring , stands in a footbath atop Mount Raruaruaha during a heavy thunderstormand shouts that Alohura , Goddess of Lightning , has the facial features of a diseased uloruaha root ) ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalking away . Every word fell as heavily as slabs of marble ; moreover , Rincewindwas certain that he was the only one who heard them . He grabbed Twoflower again . ' Let 's get out of here ! ' he suggested.  |p53One  interesting side effect of the fire in Ankh-Morpork concerns the inn-sewer-ants policy , which left the city through the ravaged roof of the Broken Drum , was wafted high into the discworld 's atmosphere on the ensuing thermal , and came to earth several days and a few thousand miles away on an uloruaha bush in the beTrobi islands . The simple , laughing islanders subsequently worshipped it as a god , much to the amusement of their more sophisticated neighbours . Strangely enough the rainfall and harvests in the next few years were almost supernaturally abundant , and this led to a research team beingdespatched to the islands by the Minor Religions faculty of UnseenUniversity . Their verdict was that it only went to show . The fire , driven by the wind , spread out from the Drum faster than a man could walk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Rincewind , his face blistered and reddened from the flames , reached them . By now he and Twoflower were on horseback  --  mounts had n't been that hard to obtain . A wily merchant had asked fifty times their worth , and had been left gaping when one thousand times their worth had been pressed into his hands . They rode through just before the first of the big gate timbers descended in an explosion of sparks . Morpork was already a cauldronof flame . As they galloped up the red-lit road Rincewind glanced sideways at his travelling companion , currently trying hard to learn to ride a horse . Bloody hell , ' he thought . He 's alive ! Me too . Who 'd have thought it ? Perhaps there is something in this **38;12657;TOOLONG ? ' It was a cumbersome phrase . Rincewind tried to get his tongue round the thick syllables that were the word in Twoflower'sown language . Ecolirix ? ' he tried . ' Ecro-gnothics ? Echo-gnomics ? ' That would do . That sounded about right . Several hundred yards downriver from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and apparently **25;12697;TOOLONG touched the mud on the widdershin bank . Immediately it sprouted numerous legs and scrabbled for a purchase.  |p54Hauling  itself to the top of the bank the Luggage  --  streaked with soot , stained with water and very , very angry  --  shook itself and took its bearings . Then it moved away at a brisk trot , the small and incrediblyugly imp that was perching on its lid watching the scenery with interest . Bravd looked at the Weasel and raised his eyebrows . And that 's it , ' said Rincewind . The Luggage caught up with us , do n't ask me how . Is there any more wine ? ' The Weasel picked up the empty wineskin . ' I think you have had just about enough wine this night , ' he said . Bravd 's forehead wrinkled . Gold is gold , ' he said finally . How can a man with plenty of gold consider himself poor ? You 're either poor or rich . It stands to reason . Rincewind hiccupped . He was finding Reason rather difficult tohold on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think is , the point is , well , you know octiron ? ' The two adventurers nodded . The strange iridescent metal was almost as highly valued in the lands around the Circle Sea as sapient pearwood , and was about as rare . A man who owned a needle madeof octiron would never lose his way , since it always pointed to the Hub of the discworld , being acutely sensitive to the disc 's magical field ; it would also miraculously darn his socks . Well , my point is , you see , that gold also has its sort of magical field . Sort of financial wizardry . Echo-gnomics . ' Rincewind giggled . The Weasel stood up and stretched . The sun was well up now , and the city below them was wreathed in mists and full of foul vapours . Also gold , he decided . Even a citizen of Morpork would , at the very point of death , desert his treasure to save his skin . Time to move . The little man called Twoflower appeared to be asleep . The Weasel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city awaits , such as it is , ' he said . Thank you for a pleasant tale , Wizard . What will you do now ? ' He eyed the Luggage , which immediately backed away and snapped its lid at him . Well , there are no ships leaving the city now , ' giggled Rincewind . ' I suppose we 'll take the coast road to Chirm . I 've got to look after him , you see . But look , I did n't make it  --  '  |p55Sure  , sure , ' said the Weasel soothingly . He turned away and swung himself into the saddle of the horse that Bravd was holding . A few moments later the two heroes were just specks under a cloud of dust , heading down towards the charcoal city . Rincewind stared muzzily at the recumbent tourist . At two recumbenttourists . In his somewhat defenceless state a stray thought , wandering through the dimensions in search of a mind to harbour it , slid into his brain . Here 's another fine mess you 've got me into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' said the Weasel . Bravd , galloping along a few feet away , nodded . All wizards get like that , ' he said . It 's the quicksilver fumes . Rots their brains . Mushrooms , too . ' However  --  ' said the brown-clad one . He reached into his tunic and took out a golden disc on a short chain . Bravd raised his eyebrows . The wizard said that the little man had some sort of golden disc that told him the time , ' said the Weasel . Arousing your cupidity , little friend ? You always were an expert thief , Weasel . ' Aye , ' agreed the Weasel modestly . He touched the knob at the disc 's rim , and it flipped open . The very small demon imprisoned within looked up from its tiny abacus and scowled . It lacks but ten minutes to eight of the clock , ' it snarled . The lid slammed shut , almost trapping the Weasel 's fingers . With an oath the Weasel hurled the time-teller far out into the heather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any event , caused the case to split ; there was a vivid octarine flash and a whiff of brimstone as the time being vanished into whatever demonic dimensionit called home . What did you do that for ? ' said Bravd , who had n't been close enough to hear the words . Do what ? ' said the Weasel . I did n't do anything . Nothing happened at all . Come on  --  we 're wasting opportunities ! ' Bravd nodded . Together they turned their steeds and galloped towardsancient Ankh , and honest enchantments.  |p56The  discworld offers sights far more impressive than those found in universes built by Creators with less imagination but more mechanicalaptitude . Although the disc 's sun is but an orbiting moonlet , its prominenceshardly bigger than croquet hoops , this slight drawback must be set against the tremendous sight of Great A'Tuin the Turtle , upon Whose ancient and meteor-riddled shell the disc ultimately rests . Sometimes , in His slow journey across the shores of Infinity , He moves His country-sized head to snap at a passing comet . But perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brains , when faced with the sheer galactic enormity of A'Tuin , refuse to believe it  --  is the endless Rimfall , where the seas of the disc boil ceaselessly over the Edge into space . Or perhaps it is the Rimbow , the eight-coloured , world-girdling rainbow that hovers in the mistladenair over the Fall . The eighth colour is octarine , caused by the scatter-effect of strong sunlight on an intense magical field . Or perhaps , again , the most magnificent sight is the Hub . There , a spire of green ice ten miles high rises through the clouds and supportsat its peak the realm of Dunmanifestin , the abode of the discp57gods . The disc gods themselves , despite the splendour of the world below them , are seldom satisfied . It is embarrassing to know that one is a god of a world that only exists because every improbability curve must have its far end ; especially when one can peer into other dimensionsat worlds whose Creators had more mechanical aptitude than imagination . No wonder , then , that the disc gods spend more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day Blind Io , by dint of constant vigilance the chief of the gods , sat with his chin on his hand and looked at the gaming board on the red marble table in front of him . Blind Io had got his name because , where his eye sockets should have been , there were nothing but two areas of blank skin . His eyes , of which he had an impressively large number , led a semi-independent life of their own . Several were currently hovering above the table . The gaming board was a carefully-carved map of the disc world , overprinted with squares . A number of beautifully modelled playing pieces were now occupying some of the squares . A human onlooker would , for example , have recognised in two of them the likenesses of Bravd and the Weasel . Others represented yet more heroes and champions , of which the disc had a more than adequate supply . Still in the game were Io , Ofer the Crocodile God , Zephyrus the god of slight breezes , Fate , and the Lady . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players had been removed from the Game . Chance had been an early casualty , running her hero into a full house of armed gnolls ( the result of a lucky throw by Ofifer ) and shortly afterwards Night had cashed his chips , pleadingan appointment with Destiny . Several minor deities had drifted up and were kibitzing over the shoulders of the players . Side bets were made that the Lady would be the next to leave the board . Her last champion of any standing was now a pinch of potash in the ruins of still-smoking Ankh-Morpork , and there were hardly any pieces that she could promote to first rank . Blind Io took up the dice-box , which was a skull whose various orifices had been stoppered with rubies , and with several of his eyes on the Lady he rolled three fives . She smiled . This was the nature of the Lady 's eyes : they were bright green , lacking iris or pupil , and they glowed from within . The room was silent as she scrabbled in her box of pieces and , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on thep58board with two decisive clicks . The rest of the players , as one God , craned forward to peer at them . A wenegade wiffard and fome fort of clerk , ' said Offler the CrocodileGod , hindered as usual by his tusks . Well , weally ! ' With one claw he pushed a pile of bone-white tokens into the centre of the table . The Lady nodded slightly . She picked up the dice-cup and held it as steady as a rock , yet all the Gods could hear the three cubes rattling about inside . And then she sent them bouncing across the table . A six . A three . A five . Something was happening to the five , however . Battered by the chance collision of several billion molecules , the die flipped onto a point , spun gently and came down a seven . Blind Io picked up the cube and counted the sides . Come on , ' he said wearily . Play fair . '  |p59The  road from Ankh-Morpork to Chirm is high , white and winding , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains and dips into cool green valleys of citrus trees , crosses liana-webbed gorges on creaking rope bridges and is generallymore picturesque than useful . Picturesque . That was a new word to Rincewind the wizard ( B. Mgc. , Unseen University failed ) . It was one of a number he had picked up since leaving the charred ruins of Ankh-Morpork . Quaint was another one . Picturesque meant  --  he decided after careful observation of the scenery that inspired Twoflower to use the word  --  that the landscape was horribly precipitous . Quaint , when used to describe the occasional village through which they passed , meant feverriddenand tumbledown . Twoflower was a tourist , the first ever seen on the discworld . Tourist , Rincewind had decided , meant idiot ' . As they rode leisurely through the thyme-scented , bee-humming air , Rincewind pondered on the experiences of the last few days . While the little foreigner was obviously insane , he was also generous and considerably less lethal than half the people the wizard hadp60mixed with in the city . Rincewind rather liked him . Disliking him would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great interest in the theory and practice of magic . It all seems , well , rather useless to me , ' he said . I always thought that , you know , a wizard just said the magic words and that was that . Not all this tedious memorising . ' Rincewind agreed moodily . He tried to explain that magic had ' indeed once been wild and lawless , but had been tamed back in the mists of time by the Olden Ones , who had bound it to obey among other things the Law of Conservation of Reality ; this demanded that the effort needed to achieve a goal should be the same regardless of the means used . In practical terms this meant that , say , creating the illusion of a glass of wine was relatively easy , since it involved merely the subtle shifting of light patterns . On the other hand , lifting a genuine wineglass a few feet in the air by sheer mental energy requiredseveral hours of systematic preparation if the wizard wished to prevent the simple principle of leverage flicking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add that some of the ancient magic could still be found in its raw state , recognisable  --  to the initiated  --  by the eightfoldshape it made in the crystalline structure of space-time . There was the metal octiron , for example , and the gas octogen . Both radiateddangerous amounts of raw enchantment . It 's all very depressing , ' he finished . Depressing ? ' Rincewind turned in his saddle and glanced as Twoflower 's Luggage , which was currently ambling along on its little legs , occasionallysnapping its lid at butterflies . He sighed . Rincewind thinks he ought to be able to harness the lightning , ' said the picture-imp , who was observing the passing scene from the tiny doorway of the box slung around Twoflower 's neck . He had spent the morning painting picturesque views and quaint scenes for his master , and had been allowed to knock off for a smoke . When I said harness I did n't mean harness , ' snapped Rincewind . I meant , well , I just meant that  --  I du n no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just think the world ought to be more sort of or-ganised . ' That 's just fantasy , ' said Twoflower.  |p61I  know . That 's the trouble . ' Rincewind sighed again . It was all very well going on about pure logic and how the universe was ruled by logic and the harmony of numbers , but the plain fact of the matter was that the disc was manifestly traversing space on the back of a giant turtle and the gods had a habit of going round to atheists ' houses and smashing their windows . There was a faint sound , hardly louder than the noise of the bees in the rosemary by the road . It had a curiously bony quality , as of rolling skulls or a whirling dicebox . Rincewind peered around . There was no-one nearby . For some reason that worried him . Then came a slight breeze , that grew and went in the space of a few heartbeats . It left the world unchanged save in a few interesting particulars . There was now , for example , a five-metre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptionally angry . This was partly because trolls generally are , in any case , but it was exacerbated by the fact that the sudden and instantaneous teleportation from its lair in the Rammerorck Mountains three thousand miles away and a thousand yards closer to the Rim had raised its internal temperature to a dangerous level , in accordance with the laws of conservation of energy . So it bared its fangs and charged . What a strange creature , ' Twoflower remarked . Is it dangerous ? ' Only to people ! ' shouted Rincewind . He drew his sword and , with a smooth overarm throw , completely failed to hit the troll . The blade plunged on into the heather at the side of the track . There was the faintest of sounds , like the rattle of old teeth . The sword struck a boulder concealed in the heather  --  concealed , a watcher might have considered , so artfully that a moment before it had not appeared to be there at all . It sprang up like a leaping salmon and in mid-ricochet plunged deeply into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature grunted , and with one swipe of a claw gouged a wound in the flank of Twoflower 's horse , which screamed and bolted into the trees at the roadside . The troll spun around and made a grab for Rincewind . Then its sluggish nervous system brought it the message that it was dead . It looked surprised for a moment , and then toppled overp62and shattered into gravel ( trolls being silicaceous lifeforms , their bodies reverted instantly to stone at the moment of death ) . Aaargh , ' thought Rincewind as his horse reared in terror . He hung on desperately as it staggered two-legged across the road and then , screaming , turned and galloped into the woods . The sound of hoofbeats died away , leaving the air to the hum of bees and the occasional rustle of butterfly wings . There was another sound , too , a strange noise for the bright time of noonday . It sounded like dice . Rincewind ? ' The long aisles of trees threw Twoflower 's voice from side to side and eventually tossed it back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock and tried to think . Firstly , he was lost . That was vexing , but it did not worry him unduly . The forest looked quite interesting and probably held elves or gnomes , perhaps both . In fact on a couple of occasions he had thought he had seen strange green faces peering down at him from the branches . Twoflower had always wanted to meet an elf . In fact what he really wanted to meet was a dragon , but an elf would do . Or a real goblin . His Luggage was missing , and that was annoying . It was also starting to rain . He squirmed uncomfortably on the damp stone , and tried to look on the bright side . For example , during its mad dash his plunging horse had burst through some bushes and disturbed a shebearwith her cubs , but had gone on before the bear could react . Then it had suddenly been galloping over the sleeping bodies of a large wolf pack and , again , its mad speed had been such that the furious yelping had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing on and perhaps it would be a good idea  --  Twoflower thought  --  not to hang about in the open . Perhaps there was a .. . he racked his brains trying to remember what sort of accommodationforests traditionally offered . . . perhaps there was a gingerbreadhouse or something ? The stone really was uncomfortable . Twoflower looked down and , for the first time , noticed the strange carving . It looked like a spider . Or was it a squid ? Moss and lichens rather blurred the precise details . But they did n't blur the runes carvedp63below it . Twoflower could read them clearly , and they said : Traveller , the hospitable temple of Bel-Shamharoth lies one thousand paces Hubwards . Now this was strange , Twoflower realised , because although he could read the message the actual letters were completely unknown to him . Somehow the message was arriving in his brain without the tedious necessity of passing through his eyes . He stood up and untied his now-biddable horse from a sapling . He was n't sure which way the Hub lay , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away between the trees . This Bel-Shamharoth seemed prepared to go out of his way to help stranded travellers . In any case , it was that or the wolves . Twoflower nodded decisively . It is interesting to note that , several hours later , a couple of wolves who were following Twoflower 's scent arrived in the glade . Their green eyes fell on the strange eight-legged carving  --  which may indeedhave been a spider , or an octopus , or may yet again have been something altogether more strange  --  and they immediately decided that they were n't so hungry , at that . About three miles away a failed wizard was hanging by his hands from a high branch in a beech tree . This was the end result of five minutes of crowded activity . First , an enraged she-bear had barged through the undergrowth and taken the throat out of his horse with one swipe of her paw . Then , as Rincewind had fled the carnage , he had run into a glade in which a number of irate wolves were milling about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rincewind 's inability to master levitation , would have then been amazed at the speed with which he reached and climbed the nearest tree , without apparently touching it . Now there was just the matter of the snake . It was large and green , and wound itself along the branch with reptilian patience . Rincewind wondered if it was poisonous , then chided himself for asking such a silly question . Of course it would be poisonous . What are you grinning for ? ' he asked the figure on the next branch . I CA N'T HELP IT , said Death . NOW WOULD YOU BE SO KIND AS TO LET GO ? I CA N'T HANG AROUND ALL DAY . I can , ' said Rincewind defiantly.  |p64The  wolves clustered around the base of the tree looked up with interest at their next meal talking to himself . IT WO N'T HURT , said Death . If words had weight , a single sentencefrom Death would have anchored a ship . Rincewind 's arms screamed their agony at him . He scowled at the vulture-like , slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Being torn apart by wolves wo n't hurt ? ' He noticed another branch crossing his dangerously narrowing one a few feet away . If he could just reach it .. . He swung himself forward , one hand outstretched . The branch , already bending , did not break . It simply made a wet little sound and twisted . Rincewind found that he was now hanging onto the end of a tongue of bark and fibre , lengthening as it peeled away from the tree . He looked down , and with a sort of fatal satisfaction realised that he would land right on the biggest wolf . Now he was moving slowly as the bark peeled back in a longer and longer strip . The snake watched him thoughtfully . But the growing length of bark held . Rincewind began to congratulatehimself until , looking up , he saw what he had hitherto not noticed . There was the largest hornets ' nest he had ever seen , hangingright in his path . He shut his eyes tightly . Why the troll ? he asked himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the troll ? What the hell is going on ? Click . It may have been a twig snapping , except that the sound appeared to be inside Rincewind 's head . Click , click . And a breeze that failed to set a single leaf atremble . The hornets ' nest was ripped from the branch as the strip passed by . It shot past the wizard 's head and he watched it grow smaller as it plummeted towards the circle of upturned muzzles . The circle suddenly closed . The circle suddenly expanded . The concerted yelp of pain as the pack fought to escape the furious cloud echoed among the trees . Rincewind grinned inanely . Rincewind 's elbow nudged something . It was the tree trunk . The strip had carried him right to the end of the branch . But there were no other branches . The smooth bark beside him offered no handholds.  |p65It  offered hands , though . Two were even now thrusting through the mossy bark beside him ; slim hands , green as young leaves . Then a shapely arm followed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonished wizard firmly and , with that vegetable strength that can send roots questing into rock , drew him into the tree . The solid bark parted like a mist , closed like a clam . Death watched impassively . He glanced at the cloud of mayflies that were dancing their joyful zigzags near His skull . He snapped His fingers . The insects fell out of the air . But , somehow , it was n't quite the same . Blind Io pushed his stack of chips across the table , glowered through such of his eyes that were currently in the room , and strode out . A few demigods tittered . At least Offler had taken the loss of a perfectly good troll with precise , if somewhat reptilian , grace . The Lady 's last opponent shifted his seat until he faced her across the board . Lord , ' she said , politely . Lady , ' he acknowledged . Their eyes met . He was a taciturn god . It was said that he had arrived in the Discworld after some terrible and mysterious incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gods to control their apparent outward form , even to other gods ; the Fate of the discworld was currently a kindly man in late middle age , greying hair brushed neatly around features that a maiden would confidently proffer a glass of small beer to , should they appear at her back door . It was a face a kindly youth would gladly help over a stile . Except for his eyes , of course . No deity can disguise the manner and nature of his eyes . The nature of the two eyes of the Fate of the discworld was this : that while at a mere glance they were simply dark , a closer look would reveal  --  too late !  --  that they were but holes opening onto a blackness so remote , so deep that the watcher would feel himself inexorably drawn into the twin pools on infinite night and their terrible , wheelingstars . . . The Lady coughed politely , and laid twenty-one white chips on the table . Then from her robe she took another chip , silvery and translucent and twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true Herop66always finds a better rate of exchange , and is valued highly by the gods . Fate raised an eyebrow . And no cheating , Lady , ' he said . But who could cheat Fate ? ' she asked . He shrugged . No-one . Yet everyone tries . ' And yet , again , I believe I felt you giving me a little assistance against the others ? ' But of course . So that the endgame could be the sweeter , Lady . And now .. He reached into his gaming box and brought forth a piece , setting it down on the board with a satisfied air . The watching deities gave a collective sigh . Even the Lady was momentarily taken aback . It was certainly ugly . The carving was uncertain , as if the craftsman'shands were shaking in horror of the thing taking shape under his reluctant fingers . It seemed to be all suckers and tentacles . And mandibles , the Lady observed . And one great eye . I thought such as He died out at the beginnings of Time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to go near this one , ' laughed Fate . He was enjoying himself . It should never have been spawned . ' Nevertheless , ' said Fate gnomically . He scooped the dice into their unusual box , and then glanced up at her . Unless , ' he added , you wish to resign . . . ? ' She shook her head . Play , ' she said . You can match my stake ? ' Play . ' Rincewind knew what was inside trees : wood , sap , possibly squirrels . Not a palace . Still  --  the cushions underneath him were definitely softer than wood , the wine in the wooden cup beside him was much tastier than sap , and there could be absolutely no comparison between a squirrel and the girl sitting before him , clasping her knees and watching him thoughtfully , unless mention was made of certain hints of furriness . The room was high , wide and lit with a soft yellow light which came from no particular source that Rincewind could identify.  |p67Through  gnarled and knotted archways he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very large winding staircase . And it had looked a perfectly normal tree from the outside , too . The girl was green  --  flesh green . Rincewind could be absolutely certain about that , because all she was wearing was a medallion around her neck . Her long hair had a faintly mossy look about it . Her eyes had no pupils and were a luminous green . Rincewind wished he had paid more attention to anthropology lectures at University . She had said nothing . Apart from indicating the couch and offeringhim the wine she had done no more than sit watching him , occasionally rubbing a deep scratch on her arm . Rincewind hurriedly recalled that a dryad was so linked to her tree that she suffered wounds in sympathy'Sorry about that , ' he said quickly . It was just an accident . I mean , there were these wolves , and  --  ' You had to climb my tree , and I rescued you , ' said the dryad smoothly . How lucky for you . And for your friend , perhaps ? ' Friend ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the dryad . Oh , sure , him , ' said Rincewind vaguely . Yeah . I hope he 's okay . ' He needs your help . ' He usually does . Did he make it to a tree too ? ' He made it to the Temple of Bel-Shamharoth . ' Rincewind choked on his wine . His ears tried to crawl into his head in terror of the syllables they had just heard . The Soul Eater ! Before he could stop them the memories came galloping back . Once , while a student of practical magic at Unseen University , and for a bet , he 'd slipped into the little room off the main library  --  the room with walls covered in protective lead pentagrams , the room no-one was allowed to occupy for more than four minutes and thirty-two seconds , which was a figure arrived at after two hundred years of cautious experimentation . . . He had gingerly opened the Book , which was chained to the octironpedestal in the middle of the rune-strewn floor not lest someone steal it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so full of magic that it had its own vague sentience . One spell had indeed leapt from the crackling pages and lodged itself in the dark recesses of his brain . And , apart from knowing that it was one of the Eight Great Spells ,  |p68no-one  would know which one until he said it . Even Rincewind did not . But he could feel it sometimes , sidling out of sight behind his Ego , biding its time .. . On the front of the Octavo had been a representation of BelShamharoth . He was not Evil , for even Evil has a certain vitality  --  Bel-Shamharoth was the flip side of the coin of which Good and Evil are but one side . The Soul Eater . His number Iyeth between seven and nine ; it is twice four , ' Rincewind quoted , his mind frozen with fear . Oh no . Where 's the Temple ? ' Hubwards , towards the centre of the forest , ' said the dryad . ' It is very old . ' But who would be so stupid as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he 's the Soul Eater  --  ' There were  --  certain advantages . And the race that used to live in these parts had strange notions . ' What happened to them , then ? ' ' I did say they used to live in these parts . ' The dryad stood up and stretched out her hand . Come . I am Druellae . Come with me and watch your friend 's fate . It should be interesting . ' I 'm not sure that  --  ' began Rincewind . The dryad turned her green eyes on him . ' Do you believe you have a choice ? ' she asked . A staircase broad as a major highway wound up through the tree , with vast rooms leading off at every landing . The sourceless yellow light was everywhere . There was also a sound like  --  Rincewind concentrated , trying to identify it  --  like far off thunder , or a distant waterfall . It 's the tree , ' said the dryad shortly . What 's it doing ? ' said Rincewind . Living . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we really in a tree ? Have I been reduced in size ? From outside it looked narrow enough for me to put my arms around . ' It is . ' ' Urn , but here I am inside it ? ' You are . '  |p69Ur  , ' said Rincewind . Druellae laughed . ' I can see into your mind , false wizard ! Am I not a dryad ? Do you not know that what you belittle by the name tree is but the mere four-dimensional analogue of a whole multidimensional universe which  --  no , I can see you do not . I should have realised that you were n't a real wizard when I saw you did n't have a staff . ' Lost it in a fire , ' lied Rincewind automatically . No hat with magic sigils embroidered on it . ' It blew off . ' ' No familiar . ' ' It died . Look , thanks for rescuing me , but if you do n't mind I think I ought to be going . If you could show me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn around . There were three he-dryads behind him . They were as naked as the woman , and unarmed . That last fact was irrelevant , however . They did n't look as though they would need weapons to fight Rincewind . They looked as though they could shoulder their way through solid rock and beat up a regiment of trolls into the bargain . The three handsome giants looked down at him with wooden menace . Their skins were the colourof walnut husks , and under it muscles bulged like sacks of melons . He turned around again and grinned weakly at Druellae . Life was beginning to take on a familiar shape again . I 'm not rescued , am I ? ' he said . I 'm captured , right ? ' Of course . ' And you 're not letting me go ? ' It was a statement . Druellae shook her head . You hurt the Tree . But you are lucky . Your friend is going to meet Bel-Shamharoth . You will only die . ' From behind two hands gripped his shoulders in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around a pebble . With a certain amount of ceremony , of course , ' the dryad wenton . After the Sender of Eight has finished with your friend . ' All Rincewind could manage to say was , You know , I never imaginedthere were he-dryads . Not even in an oak tree . ' One of the giants grinned at him . Druellae snorted . Stupid ! Where do you think acorns come from ? ' There was a vast empty space like a hall , its roof lost in the golden haze . The endless stair ran right up through it.  |p70Several  hundred dryads were clustered at the other end of the hall . They parted respectfully when Druellae approached , and stared through Rincewind as he was propelled firmly along behind . Most of them were females , although there were a few of the giant males among them . They stood like god-shaped statues among the small , intelligent females . Insects , thought Rincewind . The Tree is like a hive . But why were there dryads at all ? As far as he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had been out-evolved by humans , like most of the other Twilight Peoples . Only elves and trolls had survived the coming of Man to the discworld ; the elves because they were altogether too clever by half , and the trollen folk because they were at least as good as humans at being nasty , spiteful and greedy . Dryads were supposed to have died out , along with gnomes and pixies . The background roar was louder here . Sometimes a pulsing golden glow would race up the translucent walls until it was lost in the haze overhead . Some power in the air made it vibrate . O incompetent wizard , ' said Druellae , see some magic . Not your weasel-faced tame magic , but root-and-branch magic , the old magic . Wild magic . Watch . ' Fifty or so of the females formed a tight cluster , joined hands and walked backwards until they formed the circumference of a large circle . The rest of the dryads began a low chant . Then , at a nod from Druellae , the circle began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the complicated threads of the chant began to rise Rincewind found himself watching fascinated . He had heard about the Old Magic at University , although it was forbidden to wizards . He knew that when the circle was spinning fast enough against the standing magical field of the discworld itself in its slow turning , the resulting astral friction would build up a vast potentialdifference which would earth itself by a vast discharge of the Elemental Magical Force . The circle was a blur now , and the walls of the Tree rang with the echoes of the chantRincewind felt the familiar sticky prickling in the scalp that indicatedthe build-up of a heavy charge of raw enchantment in the vicinity , and so he was not utterly amazed when , a few seconds later ,  |p71a  shaft of vivid octarine light speared down from the invisible ceiling and focused , crackling , in the centre of the circle . There it formed an image of a storm-swept , tree-girt hill with a temple on its crest . Its shape did unpleasant things to the eye . Rincewindknew that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides . ( Eight was also the Number of Bel-Shamharoth , which was why a sensible wizard would never mention the number if he could avoid it . Or you 'll be eight alive , apprentices were jocularly warned . Bel-Shamharoth was especially attracted to dabblers in magic who , by being as it were beachcombers on the shores of the unnatural , were already half-enmeshed in his nets . Rincewind 's room number in his hall of residence had been 7a . He had n't been sur-prised . ) Rain streamed off the black walls of the temple . The only sign of life was the horse tethered outside , and it was n't Twoflower 's horse . For one thing , it was too big . It was a white charger with hooves the size of meat dishes and leather harness aglitter with ostentatious gold ornamentation . It was currently enjoying a nosebag . There was something familiar about it . Rincewind tried to remember where he had seen it before . It looked as though it was capable of a fair turn of speed , anyway . A speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could maintain for a long time . All Rincewind had to do was shake off his guards , fight his way out of the Tree , find the temple and steal the horse out from under whatever it was that Bel-Shamharoth used for a nose . The Sender of Eight has two for dinner , it seems , ' said Druellae , looking hard at Rincewind . Who does that steed belong to , false wizard ? ' I 've no idea . ' No ? Well , it does not matter . We shall see soon enough . ' She waved a hand . The focus of the image moved inwards , darted through a great octagonal archway and sped along the corridor within . There was a figure there , sidling along stealthily with its back against one wall . Rincewind saw the gleam of gold and bronze . There was no mistaking that shape . He 'd seen it many times . The wide chest , the neck like a tree-trunk , the surprisingly small headp72under its wild thatch of black hair looking like a tomato on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creeping figure , and that name was Hrun the Barbarian . Hrun was one of the Circle Sea 's more durable heroes : a fighter of dragons , a despoiler of temples , a hired sword , the kingpost of every street brawl . He could even  --  and unlike many heroes of Rincewind 's acquaintance  --  speak words of more than two syllables , if given time and maybe a hint or two . There was a sound on the edge of Rincewind 's hearing . It sounded like several skulls bouncing down the steps of some distant dungeon . He looked sideways at his guards to see if they had heard it . They had all their limited attention focused on Hrun , who was admittedly built on the same lines as themselves . Their hands were resting lightly on the wizard 's shoulders . Rincewind ducked , jerked backwards like a tumbler , and came up running . Behind him he heard Druellae shout , and he redoubled his speed . Something caught the hood of his robe , which tore off . A he-dryad waiting at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure hurtling towards him . Without breaking his stride Rincewindducked again , so low that his chin was on a level with his knees , while a fist like a log sizzled through the air by his ear . Ahead of him a whole spinney of the tree men awaited . He spun around , dodged another blow from the puzzled guard , and sped back towards the circle , passing on the way the dryads who were pursuing him and leaving them as disorganised as a set of skittles . But there were still more in front , pushing their way through the crowds of females and smacking their fists into the horny palms of their hands with anticipatory concentration . Stand still , false wizard , ' said Druellae , stepping forward . Behind her the enchanted dancers spun on ; the focus of the circle was now drifting along a violet-lit corridor . Rincewind cracked . Will you knock that off ? ' he snarled . Let 's just get this straight , right ? I am a real wizard ! ' He stamped a foot petulantly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you pass a spell . ' ' Uh  --  ' began Rincewind . The fact was that , since the ancient andmysterious spell had squatted in his mind , he had been unable toremember even the simplest cantrap for , say , killing cockroaches orp73scratching the small of his back without using his hands . The mages at Unseen University had tried to explain this by suggesting that the involuntary memorising of the spell had , as it were , tied up all his spell-retention cells . In his darker moments Rincewind had come up with his own explanation as to why even minor spells refused to stay in his head for more than a few seconds . They were scared , he decided . Um  --  ' he repeated . ' A small one would do , ' said Druellae , watching him curl his lips in a frenzy of anger and embarrassment . She signalled , and a couple of he-dryads closed in . The Spell chose that moment to vault into the **27;12724;TOOLONG of Rincewind 's consciousness . He felt it sitting there , leering defiantly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said wearily . Yes ? Pray tell , ' said Druellae . Rincewind was n't sure that he dared , although the Spell was trying to take control of his tongue . He fought it . You thed you could read by bind , ' he said indistinctly . Read it . ' She stepped forward , looking mockingly into his eyes . Her smile froze . Her hands raised protectively , she crouched back . From her throat came a sound of pure terror . Rincewind looked around . The rest of the dryads were also backingaway . What had he done ? Something terrible , apparently . But in his experience it was only a matter of time before the normalbalance of the universe restored itself and started doing the usual terrible things to him . He backed away , ducked between the stillspinningdryads who were creating the magic circle , and watched to see what Druellae would do next . Grab him , ' she screamed . Take him a long way from the Tree and kill him ! ' Rincewind turned and bolted . Across the focus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a sudden darkness . There was a vaguely Rincewind-shaped violet shadow , dwindling to a point and winking out . There was nothing at all.  |p74Hrun  the Barbarian crept soundlessly along the corridors , which were lit with a light so violet that it was almost black . His earlier confusion was gone . This was obviously a magical temple , and that explained everything . It explained why , earlier in the afternoon , he had espied a chest by the side of the track while riding through this benighted forest . Its top was invitingly open , displaying much gold . But when he had leapt off his horse to approach it the chest had sprouted legs and had gone trotting off into the forest , stopping again a few hundred yards away . Now , after several hours of teasing pursuit , he had lost it in these hell-lit tunnels . On the whole , the unpleasant carvings and occasionaldisjointed skeletons he passed held no fears for Hrun . This was partly because he was not exceptionally bright while being at the same time exceptionally unimaginative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all in a day 's work . He spent a great deal of time in similar situations , seeking gold or demons or distressed virgins and relieving them respectively of their owners , their lives and at least one cause of their distress . Observe Hrun , as he leaps cat-footed across a suspicious tunnel mouth . Even in this violet light his skin gleams coppery . There is much gold about his person , in the form of anklets and wristlets , but otherwise he is naked except for a leopardskin loincloth . He took that in the steaming forests of Howondaland , after killing its owner with his teeth . In his right hand he carries the magical black sword Kring , which was forged from a thunderbolt and has a soul but suffers no scabbard . Hrun had stolen it only three days before from the impregnable palace of the Archmandrite of B'Ituni , and he was already regretting it . It was beginning to get on his nerves . I tell you it went down that last passage on the right , ' hissed Kring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Be silent ! ' All I said was  --  ' Shut up ! '  |p75And  Twoflower .. . He was lost , he knew that . Either the building was much bigger than it looked , or he was now on some wide underground level withouthaving gone down any steps , or  --  as he was beginning to suspect  --  the inner dimensions of the place disobeyed a fairly basic rule of architecture by being bigger than the outside . And why all these strange lights ? They were eight-sided crystals set at regular intervals in the walls and ceiling , and they shed a rather unpleasant glow that did n't so much illuminate as outline the darkness . And whoever had done those carvings on the wall , Twoflower thought charitably , had probably been drinking too much . For years . On the other hand , it was certainly a fascinating building . Its builders had been obsessed with the number eight . The floor was a continuous mosaic of eight-sided tiles , the corridor walls were angled to give the corridors eight sides if the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the masonry had fallen in , Twoflowernoticed that even the stones themselves had eight sides . I do n't like it , ' said the picture imp , from his box around Twoflower'sneck . ' Why not ? ' inquired Twoflower . It 's weird . ' But you 're a demon . Demons ca n't call things weird . I mean , what 's weird to a demon ? ' Oh , you know , ' said the demon cautiously , glancing around nervouslyand shifting from claw to claw . Things . Stuff . ' Twoflower looked at him sternly . What things ? ' The demon coughed nervously ( demons do not breathe ; however , every intelligent being , whether it breathes or not , coughs nervously at some time in its life . And this was one of them as far as the demon was concerned ) . Oh , things , ' it said wretchedly . Evil things . Things we do n't talk about is the point I 'm broadly trying to get across , master . ' Twoflower shook his head wearily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd know what to do . ' Him ? ' sneered the demon . Ca n't see a wizard coming here . They ca n't have anything to do with the number eight . ' The demon slapped a hand across his mouth guiltily . Twoflower looked up at the ceiling . What was that ? ' he asked . Did n't you hear something ? '  |p76Me  ? Hear ? No ! Not a thing ! ' the demon insisted . It jerked back into its box and slammed the door . Twoflower tapped on it . The door opened a crack . It sounded like a stone moving , ' he explained . The door banged shut . Twoflower shrugged . The place is probably falling to bits , ' he said to himself . He stood up . I say ! ' he shouted . Is anyone there ? ' AIR , Air , air , replied the dark tunnels . Hullo ? ' he tried . LO , Lo , lo . I know there 's someone here , I just heard you playing dice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had just  --  ' Twoflower stopped . The reason for this was the bright point of light that had popped into existence a few feet from his eyes . It grew rapidly , and after a few seconds was the tiny bright shape of a man . At this stage it began to make a noise , or , rather , Twoflower started to hear the noise it had been making all along . It sounded like a sliver of a scream , caught in one long instant of time . The iridescent man was doll-sized now , a tortured shape tumbling in slow motion while hanging in mid-air . Twoflower wondered why he had thought of the phrase a sliver of a scream ' ... and began to wish he had n't . It was beginning to look like Rincewind . The wizard 's mouth was open , and his face was brilliantly lit by the light of  --  what ? Strange suns , Twoflower found himself thinking . Suns men do n't usually see . He shivered . Now the turning wizard was half man-size . At that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded moment , a rush of air , and an explosion of sound . Rincewind tumbled out of the air , screaming . He hit the floor hard , choked , then rolled over with his head cradled in his arms and his body curled up tightly . When the dust had settled Twoflower reached out gingerly and tapped the wizard on the shoulder . The human ball rolled up tighter . It 's me , ' explained Twoflower helpfully . The wizard unrolled a fraction . What ? ' he said . Me. '  |p77In  one movement Rincewind unrolled and bounced up in front of the little man , his hands gripping his shoulders desperately . His eyes were wild and wide . Do n't say it ! ' he hissed . Do n't say it and we might get out ! ' Get out ? How did you get in ? Do n't you know  --  ' Do n't say it ! ' Twoflower backed away from this madman . Do n't say it ! ' Do n't say what ? ' The number ! ' Number ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number ! Between seven and nine . Four plus four ! ' What , ei  --  ' Rincewind 's hands clapped over the man 's mouth . Say it and we 're doomed . Just do n't think about , right . Trust me ! ' I do n't understand ! ' wailed Twoflower . Rincewind relaxed slightly , which was to say that he still made a violin string look like a bowl of jelly . Come on , ' he said . Let 's try and get out . And I 'll try and tell you. , After the first Age of Magic the disposal of grimoires began to becomea severe problem on the discworld . A spell is still a spell even when imprisoned temporarily in parchment and ink . It has potency . This is not a problem while the book 's owner still lives , but on his death the spell book becomes a source of uncontrolled power that can not easily be defused . In short , spell books leak magic . Various solutions have been tried . Countries near the Rim simply loaded down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them over the Edge . Near the Hub less satisfactory alternatives were available . Inserting the offending books in canisters of negatively polarised octiron and sinkingthem in the fathomless depths of the sea was one ( burial in deep caves on land was earlier ruled out after some districts complained of walking trees and five-headed cats ) but before long the magic seeped out and eventually fishermen complained of shoals of invisible fish or psychic clams . A temporary solution was the construction , in various centres ofp78magical lore , of large rooms made of denatured octiron , which is impervious to most forms of magic . Here the more critical grimoires could be stored until their potency had attenuated . That was how there came to be at Unseen University the Octavo , greatest of all grimoires , formerly owned by the Creator of the Universe . It was this book that Rincewind had once opened for a bet . He had only a second to stare at a page before setting off ' various alarm spells , but that was time enough for one spell to leap from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone . Then what ? ' said Twoflower . ' Oh , they dragged me out . Thrashed me , of course . ' And no-one knows what the spell does ? ' Rincewind shook his head . It 'd vanished from the page , ' he said . ' No-one will know until I say it . Or until I die , of course . Then it will sort of say itself . For all I know it stops the universe , or ends Time , or anything . ' Twoflower patted him on the shoulder . ' No sense in brooding , ' he said cheerfully . Let 's have another look for a way out . ' Rincewind shook his head . All the terror had been spent now . He had broken through the terror barrier , perhaps , and was in the dead calm state of mind that lies on the other side . Anyway , he had ceased to gibber . ' We 're doomed , ' he stated . ' We 've been walking around all night . I tell you , this place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go , we 'll end up in the centre . ' ' It was kind of you to come looking for me , anyway , ' said Twoflower . ' How did you manage it exactly ? It was very impressive . ' ' Oh , well , ' began the wizard awkwardly . ' I just thought " I ca n't leave old Twoflower there " and  --  ' ' So what we 've got to do now is find this Bel-Shamharoth person and explain things to him and perhaps he 'll let us out , ' said Twoflower . Rincewind ran a finger around his ear . ' It must be the funny echoes in here , ' he said . ' I thought I heard you use words like find and explain . ' ' That 's right . '  |p79Rincewind  glared at him in the hellish purple glow . Find Bel-Shamharoth ? ' he said . Yes . We do n't have to get involved . ' Find the Soul Render and not get involved ? Just give him a nod , I suppose , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sender of Eignnnngh , ' Rincewind bit off the end of the word just in time and finished , You 're insane ! Hey ! Come back ! ' He darted down the passage after Twoflower , and after a few momentscame to a halt with a groan . The violet light was intense here , giving everything new and unpleasantcolours . This was n't a passage , it was a wide room with walls to a number that Rincewind did n't dare to contemplate , and ei  --  and 7a passages radiating from it . Rincewind saw , a little way off , a low altar with the same number of sides as four times two . It did n't occupy the centre of the room , however . The centre was occupied by a huge stone slab with twice as many sides as a square . It looked massive . In the strange light it appeared to be slightly tilted , with one edge standing proud of the slabs around it . Twoflower was standing on it . Hey . Rincewind ! Look what 's here ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that radiated from the room . That 's great , ' said Rincewind . Fine . It can lead us out of here . Now . ' Twoflower was already rummaging in the chest . Yes , ' he said . After I 've taken a few pictures . Just let me fit the attachment  --  ' I said now  --  ' Rincewind stopped . Hrun the Barbarian was standing in the passagemouth directly opposite him , a great black sword held in one ham-sized fist . You ? ' said Hrun uncertainly . Ahaha . Yes , ' said Rincewind . Hrun , is n't it ? Long time no see . What brings you here ? ' Hrun pointed to the Luggage . That , ' he said . This much conversation seemed to exhaust Hrun . Then he added , in a tone that combined statement , claim , threat and ultimatum : Mine . '  |p80It  belongs to Twoflower here , ' said Rincewind . Here 's a tip . Do n't touch it . ' It dawned on him that this was precisely the wrong thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was reaching for the Luggage . . . .. . which sprouted legs , backed away , and raised its lid threateningly . In the uncertain light Rincewind thought he could see rows of enormous teeth , white as bleached beechwood . Hrun , ' he said quickly , there 's something I ought to tell you . ' Hrun turned a puzzled face to him . What ? ' he said . It 's about numbers . Look , you know if you add seven and one , or three and five , or take two from ten , you get a number . While you 're here do n't say it , and we might all stand a chance of getting out of here alive . Or merely just dead . ' Who is he ? ' asked Twofiower . He was holding a cage in his hands , dredged from the bottom-most depths of the Luggage . It appeared to be full of sulking pink lizards . I am Hrun , ' said Hrun proudly . Then he looked at Rincewind . What ? ' he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Rincewind . He looked at the sword in Hrun 's hand . It was black , the sort of black that is less a colour than a graveyard of colours , and there was a highly-ornate runic inscription up the blade . More noticeable still was the faint octarine glow that surrounded it . The sword must have noticed him , too , because it suddenly spoke in a voice like a claw being scraped across glass . Strange , ' it said . Why ca n't he say eight ? ' EIGHT , Hate , ate said the echoes . There was the faintest of grindingnoises , deep under the earth . And the echoes , although they became softer , refused to die away . They bounced from wall to wall , crossing and recrossing , and the violet light flickered in time with the sound . You did it ! ' screamed Rincewind . I said you should n't say eight ! ' He stopped , appalled at himself . But the word was out now , and joined its colleagues in the general sussuration . Rincewind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thicker than treacle . A charge of magic bigger than he had ever seenp81was building up ; when he moved , in painful slow motion , his limbs left trails of golden sparks that traced their shape in the air . Behind him there was a rumble as the great octagonal slab rose into the air , hung for a moment on one edge , and crashed down on the floor . Something thin and black snaked out of the pit and wrapped itself around his ankle . He screamed as he landed heavily on the vibrating flagstones . The tentacle started to pull him across the floor . Then Twoflower was in front of him , reaching out for his hands . He grasped the little man 's arms desperately and they lay looking into each other 's faces . Rincewind slid on , even so . What 's holding you ? ' he gasped . N-nothing ! ' said Twoflower . What 's happening ? ' I 'm being dragged into this pit , what do you think ? ' Oh Rincewind , I 'm sorry  --  ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a singing saw and the pressure on Rincewind'slegs abruptly ceased . He turned his head and saw Hrun crouched by the pit , his sword a blur as it hacked at the tentacles racing out towards him . Twoflower helped the wizard to his feet and they crouched by the altar stone , watching the manic figure as it battled the questing arms . It wo n't work , ' said Rincewind . The Sender can materialise tentacles . What are you doing ? ' Twoflower was feverishly attaching the cage of subdued lizards to the picture box , which he had mounted on a tripod . I 've just got to get a picture of this , ' he muttered . It 's stupendous ! Can you hear me , imp ? ' The picture imp opened his tiny hatch , glanced momentarily at the scene around the pit , and vanished into the box . Rincewind jumped as something touched his leg , and brought his heel down on a questingtentacle . Come on , ' he said . Time to go zoom . ' He grabbed Twoflower 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave Hrun with that thing ? ' he said . Rincewind looked blank . Why not ? ' he said . It 's his job . ' But it 'll kill him ! ' It could be worse , ' said Rincewind . What ? '  |p82It  could be us , ' Rincewind pointed out logically . Come on ! ' Twoflower pointed . Hey ! ' he said . It 's got my Luggage ! ' Before Rincewind could restrain him Twoflower ran around the edge of the pit to the box , which was being dragged across the floor while its lid snapped ineffectually at the tentacle that held it . The little man began to kick at the tentacle in fury . Another one snapped out of the melee around Hrun and caught him around the waist . Hrun himself was already an indistinct shape amid the tightening coils . Even as Rincewind stared in horror the Hero 's sword was wrenched from his grasp and hurled against a wall . Your spell ! ' shouted Twoflower . Rincewind did not move . He was looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous eye , and it was staring directly at him . He whimpered as a tentacle fastened itself around his waist . The words of the spell rose unbidden in his throat . He opened his mouth as in a dream , shaping it around the first barbaric syllable . Another tentacle shot out like a whip and coiled around his throat , choking him . Staggering and gasping , Rincewind was dragged across the floor . One flailing arm caught Twoflower 's picture box as it skittered past on its tripod . He snatched it up instinctively , as his ancestors might have snatched up a stone when faced with a marauding tiger . If only he could get enough room to swing it against the Eye . . . ... the Eye filled the whole universe in front of him . Rincewind felt his will draining away like water from a sieve . In front of him the torpid lizards stirred in their cage on the picture box . Irrationally , as a man about to be beheaded notices every scratch and stain on the executioner 's block , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , he realised , throbbing alarmingly . As he was drawn towards the Eye the terror-struck Rincewind raised the box protectively , and at the same time heard the picture imp say , They 're about ripe now , ca n't hold them any longer . Everyonesmile , please . ' There was a -- flash of light so white and so bright -- it did n't seem like light at all . Bel-Shamharoth screamed , a sound that started in the far ul/trasonic and finished somewhere in Rincewind 's bowels . The tentacleswent momentarily as stiff as rods , hurling their various cargoes around the room , before bunching up protectively in front of the abused Eye . The whole mass dropped into the pit and a moment later the big slab was snatched up by several dozen tentacles and slammed into place , leaving a number of thrashing limbs trapped around the edge . Hrun landed rolling , bounced off a wall and came up on his feet . He found his sword and started to chop methodically at the doomed arms . Rincewind lay on the floor , concentrating on not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . The Luggage had landed on its curved lid . Now it was rocking angrily and kicking its little legs in the air . Warily , Rincewind looked around for Twoflower . The little man was in a crumpled heap against the wall , but at least he was groaning . The wizard pulled himself across the floor , painfully , and whispered , What the hell was that ? ' Why were they so bright ? ' muttered Twoflower . Gods , my headToo bright ? ' said Rincewind . He looked across the floor to the cage on the picture box . The lizards inside , now noticeably thinner , were watching him with interest . The salamanders , ' moaned Twoflower . The picture 'll be overexposed , I know it . . They 're salamanders ? ' asked Rincewind incredulously . Of course . Standard attachment . ' Rincewind staggered across to the box and picked it up . He 'd seen salamanders before , of course , but they had been small specimens . They had also been floating in a jar of pickle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University , since live salamanderswere extinct around the Circle Sea . He tried to remember the little he knew about them . They were magical creatures . They also had no mouths , since they subsisted entirely on the nourishing quality of the octarine wavelength in the discworld 's sunlight , which they absorbed through their skins . Of course , they also absorbed the rest of the sunlight as well , storing it in a special sac until it was excreted in the normal way . A desertp84inhabited by discworld salamanders was a veritable lighthouse at night . Rincewind put them down and nodded grimly . With all the octarine light in this magical place the creatures had been gorging themselves , and then nature had taken its course . The picture box sidled away on its tripod . Rincewind aimed a kick at it , and missed . He was beginning to dislike sapient pearwood . Something small stung his cheek . He brushed it away irritably . He looked around at a sudden grinding noise , and a voice like a carving knife cutting through silk said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hrun . He was using Kring to lever the top off the altar . He looked up at Rincewind and grinned . Rincewind hoped that rictus-strung grimace was a grin . Mighty magic , ' commented the barbarian , pushing down heavily on the complaining blade with a hand the size of a ham . Now we share the treasure , eh ? ' Rincewind grunted as something small and hard struck his ear . There was a gust of wind , hardly felt . How do you know there 's treasure in there ? ' he said . Hrun heaved , and managed to hook his fingers under the stone . You find chokeapples under a chokeapple tree , ' he said . You find treasure under altars . Logic . ' He gritted his teeth . The stone swung up and landed heavily on the floor . This time something struck Rincewind 's hand , heavily . He clawed at the air and looked at the thing he had caught . It was a piece of stone with five-plus-three sides . He looked up at the ceiling . Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tune as he began to pull crumbling leather from the desecrated altar . The air crackled , fluoresced , hummed . Intangible winds gripped the wizard 's robe , flapping it out in eddies of blue and green sparks . Around Rincewind 's head mad , half-formed spirits howled and gibberedas they were sucked past . He tried raising a hand . It was immediately surrounded by a glowingoctarine corona as the rising magical wind roared past . The gale raced through the room without stirring one iota of dust , yet it was blowing Rincewind 's eyelids inside out . It screamed along the tunnels , its banshee-wail bouncing madly from stone to stone . Twoflower staggered up , bent double in the teeth of the astral gale.  |p85'What  the hell is this ? ' he shouted . Rincewind half-turned . Immediately the howling wind caught him , nearly pitching him over . Poltergeist eddies , spinning in the rushing air , snatched at his feet . Hrun 's arm shot out and caught him . A moment later he and Twoflower had been dragged into the lee of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beside them the talking sword Kring sparkled , its magical field boosted a hundredfold by the storm . Hold on ! ' screamed Rincewind . The wind ! ' shouted Twoflower . Where 's it coming from ? Where 's it blowing to ? ' He looked into Rincewind 's mask of sheer terror , which made him redouble his own grip on the stones . We 're doomed , ' murmured Rincewind , while overhead the roof cracked and shifted . Where do shadows come from ? That 's where the wind is blowing ! ' What was in fact happening , as the wizard knew , was that as the abused spirit of Bel-Shamharoth sank through the deeper chthonic planes his brooding spirit was being sucked out of the very stones into the region which , according to the discworld 's most reliable priests , was both under the ground and Somewhere Else . In consequencehis temple was being abandoned to the ravages of Time , who for thousands of shamefaced years had been reluctant to go near the place . Now the suddenly released , accumulated weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbraced stones . Hrun glanced up at the widening cracks and sighed . Then he put two fingers into his mouth and whistled . Strangely the real sound rang out loudly over the pseudosound of the widening astral whirlpool that was forming in the middle of the great octagonal slab . It was followed by a hollow echo which sounded , he fancied , strangely like the bouncing of strange bones . Then came a noise with no hint of strangeness . It was hollow hoofbeats . Hrun 's warhorse cantered through a creaking archway and reared up by its master , its mane streaming in the gale . The barbarian pulled himself to his feet and slung his treasure bags into a sack that hung from the saddle , then hauled himself onto the beast 's back . He reached down and grabbed Twoflower by the scruff of his neck , dragging him across the saddle tree . As the horse turned aroundp86Rincewind took a desperate leap and landed behind Hrun , who raised no objection . The horse pounded surefooted along the tunnels , leaping sudden slides of rubble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the straining roof . Rincewind , clinging on grimly , looked behind them . No wonder the horse was moving so swiftly . Close behind , speedingthrough the flickering violet light , were a large ominous-looking chest and a picture box that skittered along dangerously on its three legs. , So great was the ability of sapient pearwood to follow its master anywhere , the gravegoods of dead emperors had traditionally been made of it .. . They reached the outer air a moment before the octagonal arch finally broke and smashed into the flags . The sun was rising . Behind them a column of dust rose as the temple collapsed in on itself , but they did not look back . That was a shame , because Twoflower might have been able to obtain pictures unusual even by discworld standards . There was movement in the smoking ruins . They seemed to be growing a green carpet . Then an oak tree spiralled up , branching out like an exploding green rocket , and was in the middle of a venerable copse even before the tips of its aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fungus , matured , rotted , and fell in a cloud of tinder dust amid its struggling offspring . Already the temple was a half-buried heap of mossy stones . But Time , having initially gone for the throat , was now setting out to complete the job . The boiling interface between decaying magic and ascendant entropy roared down the hill and overtook the gallopinghorse , whose riders , being themselves creatures of Time , completelyfailed to notice it . But it lashed into the enchanted forest with the whip of centuries . Impressive , is n't it ? ' observed a voice by Rincewind 's knee as the horse cantered through the haze of decaying timber and falling leaves . The voice had an eerie metallic ring to it . Rincewind looked down at Kring the sword . It had a couple of rubies set in the pommel . He got the impression they were watching him . From the moorland rimwards of the wood they watched the battle between the trees and Time , which could only have one ending . Itp87was a sort of cabaret to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption of quite a lot of a bear which had incautiously come within bowshot of Hrun . Rincewind watched Hrun over the top of his slab of greasy meat . Hrun going about the business of being a hero , he realised , was quite different to the wine-bibbing , carousing Hrun who occasionally came to Ankh-Morpork . He was cat-cautious , lithe as a panther , and thoroughlyat home . And I 've survived Bel-Shamharoth , Rincewind reminded himself . Fantastic . Twoflower was helping the hero sort through the treasure stolen from the temple . It was mostly silver set with unpleasant purple stones . Representations of spiders , octopi and the tree-dwelling octarsierof the hubland wastes figured largely in the heap . Rincewind tried to shut his ears to the grating voice beside him . It was no use.  --  and then I belonged to the Pasha of Re'durat and played a prominent part in the battle of the Great Nef , which is where I received the slight nick you may have noticed some two-thirds of the way up my blade , ' Kring was saying from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing an octiron collar , most unsporting , and of course I was a lot sharper in those days and my master used to use me to cut silk handkerchiefs in mid-air and  --  am I boring you ? ' Huh ? Oh , no , no , not at all . It 's all very interesting , ' said Rincewind , with his eyes still on Hrun . How trustworthy would he be ? Here they were , out in the wilds , there were trolls about .. . I could see you were a cultured person , ' Kring went on . So seldomdo I get to meet really interesting people , for any length of time , anyway . What I 'd really like is a nice mantlepiece to hang over , somewhere nice and quiet . I spent a couple of hundred years on the bottom of a lake once . ' That must have been fun , ' said Rincewind absently . Not really , ' said Kring . No , I suppose not . ' What I 'd really like is to be a ploughshare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sounds like an existence with some point to it . ' Twoflower hurried over to the wizard . I had a great idea , ' he burbled.  |p88Yah  , ' said Rincewind , wearily . Why do n't we get Hrun to accompanyus to Quirm ? ' Twoflower looked amazed . How did you know ? ' he said . I just thought you 'd think it , ' said Rincewind . Hrun ceased stuffing silverware into his saddlebags and grinnedencouragingly at them . Then his eyes strayed back to the Luggage . If we had him with us , who 'd attack us ? ' said Twoflower . Rincewind scratched his chin . Hrun ? ' he suggested . But we saved his life in the Temple ! ' Well , if by attack you mean kill , ' said Rincewind , I do n't think he 'd do that . He 's not that sort . He 'd just rob us and tie us up and leave us for the wolves , I expect . ' Oh , come on . ' Look , this is real life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , carrying around a box full of gold , do n't you think anyone in their right minds would jump at the chance of pinching it ? ' I would , he added mentally  --  if I had n't seen what the Luggage does to prying fingers . Then the answer hit him . He looked from Hrun to the picture box . The picture imp was doing its laundry in a tiny tub , while the salamandersdozed in their cage . I 've got an idea , ' he said . I mean , what is it heroes really want ? ' Gold ? ' said Twoflower . No . I mean really want . ' Twoflower frowned . I do n't quite understand , ' he said . Rincewind picked up the picture box . Hrun , ' he said . Come over here , will you ? ' The days passed peacefully . True , a small band of bridge trolls tried to ambush them on one occasion , and a party of brigands nearly caught them unawares one night ( but unwisely tried to investigate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got , double pay for both occasions . If any harm comes to us , ' said Rincewind , then there will be nooneto operate the magic box . No more pictures of Hrun , you under-stand ? ' Hrun nodded , his eyes fixed on the latest picture . It showed Hrun striking a heroic pose , with one foot on a heap of slain trolls.  |p89'Me  and you and little friend Two Flowers , we all get on hokay , ' he said . Also tomorrow , may we get a better profile , hokay ? ' He carefully wrapped the picture in trollskin and stowed it in his saddlebag , along with the others . ' It seems to be working , ' said Twoflower admiringly , as Hrun rode ahead to scout the road . Sure , ' said Rincewind . What heroes like best is themselves . ' You 're getting quite good at using the picture box , you know that ? ' ' Yar . ' ' So you might like to have this . ' Twoflower held out a picture . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just the picture you took in the temple . ' Rincewind looked in horror . There , bordered by a few glimpses of tentacle , was a huge , whorled , calloused , potion-stained and unfocusedthumb . ' That 's the story of my life , ' he said wearily . ' You win , ' said Fate , pushing the heap of souls across the gaming table . The assembled gods relaxed . ' There will be other games , ' he added . The Lady smiled into two eyes that were like holes in the universe . And then there was nothing but the ruin of the forests and a cloud of dust on the horizon , which drifted away on the breeze . And , sitting on a pitted and moss-grown milestone , a black and raggedy figure . His was the air of one who is unjustly put upon , who is dreaded and feared , yet who is the only friend of the poor and the best doctor for the mortally wounded . Death , although of course completely eyeless , watched Rincewind disappearing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , have been a frown . Death , although exceptionally busy at all times , decided that He now had a hobby . There was something about the wizard that irked Him beyond measure . He did n't keep appointments , for one thing . I 'LL GET YOU YET , CULLY , said Death , in the voice like the slammingof leaden coffin lids , SEE IF I DON'T.  |p90It  was called the Wyrmberg and it rose almost one half of a mile above the green valley ; a mountain huge , grey and upside down . At its base it was a mere score of yards across . Then it rose through clinging cloud , curving gracefully outward like an upturned trumpet until it was truncated by a plateau fully a quarter of a mile across . There was a tiny forest up there , its greenery cascading over the lip . There were buildings . There was even a small river , tumbling over the edge in a waterfall so wind-whipped that it reached the ground as rain . There were also a number of cave mouths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crudely-carved , regular look about them , so that on this crisp autumn morning the Wyrmberg hung over the clouds like a giant 's dovecote . This would mean that the doves ' had a wingspan slightly in excess of forty yards . I knew it , ' said Rincewind . We 're in a strong magical field . ' Twoflower and Hrun looked around the little hollow where they had made their noonday halt . Then they looked at each other.  |p91The  horses were quietly cropping the rich grass by the stream . Yellow butterflies skittered among the bushes . There was a smell of thyme and a buzzing of bees . The wild pigs on the spit sizzled gently . Hrun shrugged and went back to oiling his biceps . They gleamed . Looks alright to me , ' he said . Try tossing a coin , ' said Rincewind . What ? ' Go on . Toss a coin . ' Hokay , ' said Hrun . If it gives you any pleasure . ' He reached into his pouch and withdrew a handful of loose change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected a Zchloty leaden quarteriotumand balanced it on a purple thumbnail . You call , ' he said . Heads or  --  ' he inspected the obverse with an air of intense concentration , some sort of a fish with legs . ' When it 's in the air , ' said Rincewind . Hrun grinned and flicked his thumb . The iotum rose , spinning . Edge , ' said Rincewind , without looking at it . Magic never dies . It merely fades away . Nowhere was this more evident on the wide blue expanse of the discworld than in those areas that had been the scene of the great battles of the Mage Wars , which had happened very shortly after Creation . In those days magic in its raw state had been widely available , and had been eagerly utilised by the First Men in their war against the Gods . The precise origins of the Mage Wars have been lost in the fogs of Time , but disc philosophers agree that the First Men , shortly after their creation , understandably lost their temper . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheeled across the sky , the seas boiled , weird storms ravaged the land , small white pigeons mysteriously appeared in people 's clothing , and the very stabilityof the disc ( carried as it was through space on the backs of four giant turtle-riding elephants ) was threatened . This resulted in stern action by the Old High Ones , to whom even the Gods themselves are answerable . The Gods were banished to high places , men were recreateda good deal smaller , and much of the old wild magic was sucked out of the earth.  |p92That  did not solve the problem of those places on the disc which , during the wars , had suffered a direct hit by a spell . The magic faded away  --  slowly , over the millennia , releasing as it decayed myriads of sub-astral particles that severely distorted the reality around it .. . Rincewind , Twoflower and Hrun stared at the coin . Edge it is , ' said Hrun . Well , you 're a wizard . So what ? ' I do n't do  --  that sort of spell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignored this , because it was true . Try it again , ' he suggested . Hrun pulled out a fistful of coins . The first two landed in the usual manner . So did the fourth . The third landed on its edge and balanced there . The fifth turned into a small yellow caterpillar and crawled away . The sixth , upon reaching its zenith , vanished with a sharp ' spang ! ' A moment later there was a small thunder clap . Hey , that one was silver ! ' exclaimed Hrun , rising to his feet and staring upwards . Bring it back ! ' I do n't know where it 's gone , ' said Rincewind wearily . It 's probably still accelerating . The ones I tried this morning did n't come down , anyway . ' Hrun was still staring into the sky . What ? ' said Twoflower . Rincewind sighed . He had been dreading this . We 've strayed into a zone with a high magical index , ' he said . Do n't ask me how . Once upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , and we 're feeling the after-effects . ' Precisely , ' said a passing bush . Hrun 's head jerked down . You mean this is one of those places ? ' he asked . Let 's get out of here ! ' Right , ' agreed Rincewind . If we retrace our steps we might make it . We can stop every mile or so and toss a coin . ' He stood up urgently and started stuffing things into his saddlebags . What ? ' said Twoflower.  |p93Rincewind  stopped . Look , ' he snapped . Just do n't argue . Come on. , It looks alright , ' said Twoflower . Just a bit underpopulated , that 's all .. Yes , ' said Rincewind . Odd , is n't it ? Come on ! ' There was a noise high above them , like a strip of leather being slapped on a wet rock . Something glassy and indistinct passed over Rincewind 's head , throwing up a cloud of ashes from the fire , and the pig carcass took off from the spit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clump of trees , righted itself , roared around in a tight circle , and headed hubwards leaving a trail of hot pork-fat droplets . What are they doing now ? ' asked the old man . The young woman glanced at the scrying glass . Heading rimwards at speed , ' she reported . ' By the way  --  they 've still got that box on legs . ' The old man chuckled , an oddly disturbing sound in the dark and dusty crypt . Sapient pearwood , ' he said . Remarkable . Yes , I think we will have that . Please see to it , my dear  --  before they go beyond your power , perhaps ? ' Silence ! Or  --  ' ' Or what , Liessa ? ' said the old man ( in this dim light there was something odd about the way he was slumped in the stone chair ) . You killed me once already , remember ? ' She snorted and stood up , tossing back her hair scornfully . It was red , flecked with gold . Erect , Liessa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked , except for a couple of mere scraps of the lightest chain mail and riding boots of iridescent dragonhide . In one boot was thrust a riding crop , unusual in that it was as long as a spear and tipped with tiny steel barbs . My power will be quite sufficient , ' she said coldly . The indistinct figure appeared to nod , or at least to wobble . ' As you keep assuring me , ' he said . Liessa snorted , and strode out of the hall . Her father did not bother to watch her go . One reason for this was , of course , that since he had been dead for three months his eyes were in any case not in the best of condition . The other was that as ap94wizard  --  even a dead wizard of the fifteenth grade , his optic nerves had long since become attuned to seeing into levels and dimensions far removed from common reality , and were therefore somewhat inefficient at observing the merely mundane . ( During his life they had appeared to others to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was now suspended in the narrow space between the living world and the dark shadow-world of Death he could survey the whole of Causality itself . That was why , apart from a mild hope that this time his wretched daughter would get herself killed , he did not devote his considerable powers to learning more about the three travellers galloping desperately out of his realm . Several hundred yards away , Liessa was in a strange humour as she strode down the worn steps that led into the hollow heart of the Wyrmberg , followed by half a dozen Riders . Would this be the opportunity ? Perhaps here was the key to break the deadlock , the key to the throne of the Wyrmberg . It was rightfully hers , of course ; but tradition said that only a man could rule the Wyrmberg . That irked Liessa , and when she was angry the Power flowed stronger and the dragons were especially big and ugly . If she had a man , things would be different . Someone who , for preference , was a big strapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he was told .. . The biggest of the three now fleeing the dragonlands might do . And if it turned out that he would n't , then dragons were always hungry and needed to be fed regularly . She could see to it that they got ugly . Uglier than usual , anyway . The stairway passed through a stone arch and ended in a narrow ledge near the roof of the great cavern where the Wyrms roosted . Sunbeams from the myriad entrances around the walls crisscrossedthe dusty gloom like amber rods in which a million golden insects had been preserved . Below , they revealed nothing but a thin haze . Above . . . The walking rings started so close to Liessa 's head that she could reach up and touch one . They stretched away in their thousands across the upturned acres of the cavern roof . It had taken a score of masons a score of years to hammer the pitons for all those , hangingp95from their work as they progressed . Yet they were as nothing compared to the eighty-eight major rings that clustered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been lost in the old days , as they were swung into place by teams of sweating slaves ( and there had been slaves aplenty , in the first days of the Power ) and the great rings had gone crashing into the depths , dragging their unfortunate manipulatorswith them . But eighty-eight had been installed , huge as rainbows , rusty as blood . From them . . . The dragons sense Liessa 's presence . Air swishes around the cavern as eighty-eight pairs of wings unfold like a complicated puzzle . Great heads with green , multi faceted eyes peer down at her . The beasts are still faintly transparent . While the men around her take their hookboots from the rack , Liessa bends her mind to the task of full visualisation ; above her in the musty air the dragons become fully visible , bronze scales dully reflecting the sunbeam shafts . Her mind throbs , but now that the Power is flowing fully she can , with barely a waver of concentration , think of other things . Now she too buckles on the hookboots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faint clang , against a couple of the walking rings in the ceiling . Only now it is the floor . The world has changed . Now she is standing on the edge of a deep bowl or crater , floored with the little rings across which the dragonriders are already strolling with a pendulum gait . In the centre of the bowl their huge mounts wait among the herd . Far above are the distant rocks of the cavern floor , discoloured by centuries of dragon droppings . Moving with the easy gliding movement that is second nature Liessa sets off towards her own dragon , Laolith , who turns his great horsey head towards her . His jowls are greasy with pork fat . It was very enjoyable , he says in her mind . I thought I said there were to be no unaccompanied flights ? ' she snaps . I was hungry , Liessa . Curb your hunger . Soon there will be horses to eat . ' The reins stick in our teeth . Are there any warriors ? We like warriors.  |p96Liessa  swings down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laolith 's leathery neck . The warrior is mine . There are a couple of others you can have One appears to be a wizard of sorts , ' she adds by way of encouragement . Oh , you know how it is with wizards . Half an hour afterwards you could do with another one , the dragon grumbles . He spreads his wings and drops . They 're gaining ! ' screamed Rincewind . He bent even lower over his horse 's neck and groaned . Twoflower was trying to keep up while at the same time craning round to look at the flying beasts . You do n't understand ! ' screamed the tourist , above the terrible noise of the wingbeats . All my life I 've wanted to see dragons ! ' From the inside ? ' shouted Rincewind . Shut up and ride ! ' He whipped at his horse with the reins and stared at the wood ahead , trying to drag it closer by sheer willpower . Under those trees they 'd be safe . Under those trees no dragons could fly .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him . Instinctively he rolled in the saddle and felt the white-hot stab of pain as something sharp scored a line across his shoulders . Behind him Hrun screamed , but it sounded more like a bellow of rage than a cry of pain . The barbarian had vaulted down into the heather and had drawn the black sword , Kring . He flourished it as one of the dragons curved in for another low pass . No bloody lizard does that to me ! ' he roared . Rincewind leaned over and grabbed Twoflower 's reins . Come on ! ' he hissed . But , the dragons  --  ' said Twoflower , entranced . Blast the  --  ' began the wizard , and froze . Another dragon had peeled off from the circling dots overhead and was gliding towards them . Rincewind let go of Twoflower 's horse , swore bitterly , and spurred his own mount towards the trees , alone . He did n't look back at the sudden commotion behind him and , when a shadow passed over him , merely gibbered weakly and tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of the searing , piercing pain he had expected , there was a series of stinging blows as the terrified animal passed under thep97eaves of the wood . The wizard tried to hang on but another low branch , stouter than the others , knocked him out of the saddle . The last thing he heard before the flashing blue lights of unconsciousness closed in was a high reptilian scream of frustration , and the thrashingof talons in the treetops . When he awoke a dragon was watching him ; at least , it was staring in his general direction . Rincewind groaned and tried to dig his way into the moss with his shoulderblades , then gasped as the pain hit him . Through the mists of agony and fear he looked back at the dragon . The creature was hanging from a branch of a large dead oak tree , several hundred feet away . Its bronze-gold wings were tightly wrapped around its body but the long equine head turned this way and that at the end of a remarkably prehensile neck . It was scanning the forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off its scales , Rincewind could clearly make out the outlines of the branches behind it . On one of them a man was sitting , dwarfed by the hanging reptile . He appeared to be naked except for a pair of high boots , a tiny leather hold-all in the region of his groin , and a high-crested helmet . He was swinging a short sword back and forth idly , and stared out across the tree tops with the air of one carrying out a tedious and unglamorous assignment . A beetle began to crawl laboriously up Rincewind 's leg . The wizard wondered how much damage a half-solid dragoncould do . Would it only half-kill him ? He decided not to stay and find out . Moving on heels , fingertips and shoulder muscles , Rincewind wriggled sideways until foliage masked the oak and its occupants . Then he scrambled to his feet and hared off between the trees . He had no destination in mind , no provisions , and no horse . But while he still had legs he could run . Ferns and brambles whipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . When he had put about a mile between him and the dragon he stopped and collapsed against a tree , which then spoke to him . Psst , ' it said.  |p98Dreading  what he might see , Rincewind let his gaze slide upwards . It tried to fasten on innocuous bits of bark and leaf , but the scourge of curiosity forced it to leave them behind . Finally it fixed on a black sword thrust straight through the branch above Rincewind 's head . Do n't just stand there , ' said the sword ( in a voice like the sound of a finger dragged around the rim of a large empty wine glass ) . Pull me out . ' What ? ' said Rincewind , his chest still heaving . Pull me out , ' repeated Kring . It 's either that or I 'll be spending the next million years in a coal measure . Did I ever tell you about the time I was thrown into a lake up in the  --  ' What happened to the others ? ' said Rincewind , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . And the horses . And that box thing . Me too , except that Hrun dropped me . What a stroke of luck for you . ' Well  --  ' began Rincewind . Kring ignored him . ' I expect you 'll be in a hurry to rescue them , ' it added . Yes , well  --  ' So if you 'll just pull me out we can be off . ' Rincewind squinted up at the sword . A rescue attempt had hithertobeen so far at the back of his mind that , if some advanced speculations on the nature and shape of the many-dimensioned multiplexityof the universe were correct , it was right at the front ; but a magic sword was a valuable item .. . And it would be a long trek back home , wherever that was .. . He scrambled up the tree and inched along the branch . Kring wasburied very firmly in the wood . He gripped the pommel and heaveduntil lights flashed in front of his eyes . Try again , ' said the sword encouragingly . Rincewind groaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Kring . This could have been an anvil . ' Yaargh , ' hissed the wizard , fearing for the future of his grow . I have had a multidimensional existence , ' said the sword . Ungh ? ' I have had many names , you know . ' Amazing , ' said Rincewind . He swayed backwards as the blade slid free . It felt strangely light . Back on the ground again he decided to break the news.  |p99I  really do n't think rescue is a good idea , ' he said . I think we 'd better head back to a city , you know . To raise a search party . ' The dragons headed hubwards , ' said Kring . However , I suggest we start with the one in the trees over there . ' Sorry , but  --  ' You ca n't leave them to their fate ! ' Rincewind looked surprised . ' I ca n't ? ' he said . No . You ca n't . Look , I 'll be frank . I 've worked with better materialthan you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever spent a million years in a coal measure ? ' Look , I  --  ' So if you do n't stop arguing I 'll chop your head off . ' Rincewind saw his own arm snap up until the shimmering blade was humming a mere inch from his throat . He tried to force his fingers to let go . They would n't . I do n't know how to be a hero ! ' he shouted . I propose to teach you . ' Bronze Psepha rumbled deep in his throat . K ! sdra the dragonrider leaned forward and squinted across the clearing . I see him , ' he said . He swung himself down easily from branch to branch and landed lightly on the tussocky grass , drawing his sword . He took a long look at the approaching man , who was obviously not keen on leaving the shelter of the trees . He was armed , but the dragonrider observed with some interest the strange way in which the man held the sword in front of him at arm 's length , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sdra hefted his own sword and grinned expansively as the wizardshuffled towards him . Then he leapt . Later , he remembered only two things about the fight . He recalled the uncanny way in which the wizard 's sword curved up and caught his own blade with a shock that jerked it out of his grip . The other thing  --  and it was this , he averred , that led to his downfall  --  was that the wizard was covering his eyes with one hand . K ! sdra jumped back to avoid another thrust and fell full length on the turf . With a snarl Psepha unfolded his great wings and launched himself from his tree.  |p100A  moment later the wizard was standing over him , shouting , Tell it that if it singes me I 'll let the sword go ! I will ! I 'll let it go ! So tell it ! ' The tip of the black sword was hovering over K ! sdra 's throat . What was odd was that the wizard was obviously struggling with it , and it appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sdra shouted . The dragon roared in defiance , but pulled out of the dive that would have removed Rincewind 's head , and flapped ponderously back to the tree . Talk ! ' screamed Rincewind . K ! sdra squinted at him up the length of the sword . What would you like me to say ? ' he asked . What ? ' I said what would you like me to say ? ' Where are my friends ? The barbarian and the little man is what I mean ! ' I expect they have been taken back to the Wyrmberg . ' Rincewind tugged desperately against the surge of the sword , trying to shut his mind to Kring 's bloodthirsty humming . What 's a Wyrmberg ? ' he said . The Wyrmberg . There is only one . It is Dragonhome . ' And I suppose you were waiting to take me there , eh ? ' K ! sdra yelped involuntarily as the tip of the sword pricked a beadof blood from his adam 's apple . Do n't want people to know you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragonrider forgot himself enough to nod , and came within a quarter-inch of cutting his own throat . Rincewind looked around desperately , and realised that this wassomething he was really going to have to go through with . Right then , ' he said as diffidently as he could manage . You'dbetter take me to this Wyrmberg of yours , had n't you ? ' I was supposed to take you in dead , ' muttered K ! sdra sullenly . Rincewind looked down at him and grinned slowly . It was a wide , manic and utterly humourless rictus . It was the sort of grin that is normally accompanied by small riverside birds wandering in and out , picking scraps out of the teeth . Alive will do , ' said Rincewind . If we 're talking about anyone being dead , remember whose sword is in which hand . '  |p101If  you kill me nothing will prevent Psepha killing you ! ' shouted the prone dragonrider . So what I 'll do is , I 'll chop bits off , ' agreed the wizard . He tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , ' said K ! sdra sulkily . Do you think I 've got no imag-ination ? ' He wriggled out from under the sword and waved at the dragon , which took wing again and glided in towards them . Rincewind swallowed . You mean we 've got to go on that ? ' he said . K ! sdra looked at him scornfully , the point of Kring still aimed at his neck . How else would anyone get to the Wyrmberg ? ' I do n't know , ' said Rincewind . How else ? ' I mean , there is no other way . It 's flying or nothing . ' Rincewind looked again at the dragon before him . He could quite clearly see through it to the crushed grass on which it lay but , when he gingerly touched a scale that was a mere golden sheen on thin air , it felt solid enough . Either dragons should exist completely or fail to exist at all , he felt . A dragon only half-existing was worse than the extremes . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . K ! sdra shrugged . Did n't you ? ' he said . He swung himself astride the dragon awkwardly , because Rincewindwas hanging on to his belt . Once uncomfortably aboard the wizard moved his white-knuckle grip to a convenient piece of harnessand prodded K ! sdra lightly with the sword . Have you ever flown before ? ' said the dragonrider , without lookinground . Not as such , no . ' Would you like something to suck ? ' Rincewind gazed at the back of the man 's head , then dropped to the bag of red and yellow sweets that was being proffered . Is it necessary ? ' he asked . ' It is traditional , ' said K ! sdra . Please yourself . ' The dragon stood up , lumbered heavily across the meadow , and fluttered into the air . Rincewind occasionally had nightmares about teetering on some intangible but enormously high place , and seeing a blue-distanced , cloud-punctuated landscape reeling away below him ( this usuallyp102woke him up with his ankles sweating ; he would have been even more worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought , just the usual discworld vertigo . It was a backwards memoryof an event in his future so terrifying that it had generated harmonicsof fear all the way along his lifeline ) . This was not that event , but it was good practise for it . Psepha clawed its way into the air with a series of **26;12753;TOOLONG . At the top of its last leap the wide wings unfolded with a snap and spread out with a thump which shook the trees . Then the ground was gone , dropping away in a series of gentle jerks . Psepha was suddenly rising gracefully , the afternoon sunlight gleaming off wings that were still no more than a golden film . Rincewindmade the mistake of glancing downwards , and found himself looking through the dragon to the treetops below . Far below . His stomach shrank at the sight . Closing his eyes was n't much better , because it gave his imaginationfull rein . He compromised by gazing fixedly into the middle distance , where moorland and forest drifted by and could be contemplatedalmost casually . Wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted into his ear . Behold the Wyrmberg ! ' Rincewind turned his head slowly , taking care to keep Kring restinglightly on the dragon 's back . His streaming eyes saw the impossiblyinverted mountain rearing out of the deep forested valley like a trumpet in a tub of moss . Even at this distance he could make out the faint octarine glow in the air that must be indicating a stable magic aura of at least  --  he gasped  --  several milliPrime ? At least ! Oh no , ' he said . Even looking at the ground was better than that . He averted his eyes quickly , and realised that he could now no longer see the ground through the dragon . As they glided around in a wide circle towards the Wyrmberg it was definitely taking on a more solid form , as if the creature 's body was filling with a gold mist . By the time the Wyrmberg was in front of them , swinging wildly across the sky , the dragon was as real as a rock . Rincewind thought he could see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountain had reached out and touched thep103beast . He got the strange feeling that the dragon was being made more genuine . Ahead of it the Wyrmberg turned from a distant toy to several billion tons of rock poised between heaven and earth . He could see small fields , woods and a lake up there , and from the lake a river spilled out and over the edge . . . He made the mistake of following the thread of foaming water with his eyes , and jerked himself back just in time . The flared plateau of the upturned mountain drifted towards them . The dragon did n't even slow . As the mountain loomed over Rincewind like the biggest fly-swatterin the universe he saw a cave mouth . Psepha skimmed towards it , shoulder muscles pumping . The wizard screamed as the dark spread and enfolded him . There was a brief vision of rock flashing past , blurred by speed . Then the dragon was in the open again . It was inside a cave , but bigger than any cave had a right to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a mere gilded fly in a banqueting hall . There were other dragons  --  gold , silver , black , white -- flapping across the sun-shafted air on errands of their own or perched on outcrops of rock . High in the domed roof of the cavern scores of others hung from huge rings , their wings wrapped bat-like around their bodies . There were men up there , too . Rincewind swallowed hard when he saw them , because they were walking on that broad expanse of ceiling like flies . Then he made out the thousands of tiny rings that studded the ceiling . A number of inverted men were watching Psepha 's flight with interest . Rincewind swallowed again . For the life of him he could n't think of what to do next . Well ? ' he asked , in a whisper . Any suggestions ? ' Obviously you attack , ' said Kring scornfully . Why did n't I hink of hat ? ' said Rincewind . Could it be because they all have crossbows ? ' You 're a defeatist . ' Defeatist ! That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're your own worst enemy , Rincewind , ' said the sword . Rincewind looked up at grinning men . Bet ? ' he said wearily.  |p104Before  Kring could reply Psepha reared in mid-air and alighted on one of the large rings , which rocked alarmingly . Would you like to die now , or surrender first ? ' asked K ! sdra calmly . Men were converging on the ring from all directions , walking with a swaying motion as their hooked boots engaged the ceiling rings . There were more boots on a rack that hung in a small platform built on the side of the perch-ring . Before Rincewind could stop him the dragonrider had leapt from the creature 's back to land on the platform , where he stood grinning at the wizard 's discomforture . There was a small expressive sound made by a number of crossbowsbeing cocked . Rincewind looked up at a number of impassive , upside down faces . The dragonfolk 's taste in clothing did n't run to anything much more imaginative than a leather harness , studded with bronze ornaments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were not wearing helmets let their hair flow freely , so that it moved like seaweed in the ventilation breeze near the roof . There were several women among them . The inversion did strange things to their anatomy . Rincewind stared . Surrender , ' said K ! sdra again . Rincewind opened his mouth to do so . Kring hummed a warning , and agonising waves of pain shot up his arm . Never , ' he squeaked . The pain stopped . ' Of course he wo n't ! ' boomed an expansive voice behind him . He 's a hero , is n't he ? ' Rincewind turned and looked into a pair of hairy nostrils . They belonged to a heavily built young man , hanging nonchalantly from the ceiling by his boots . What is your name , hero ? ' said the man . ' So that we know who you were . ' Agony shot up Rincewind 's arm . ' I  --  I 'm Rincewind of Ankh , ' he managed to gasp . And I am Liolrt Dragonlord , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harsh click in the back of the throat that Rincewindcould only think of as a kind of integral punctuation . You have come to challenge me in mortal combat . ' Well , no , I did n't  --  ' You are mistaken . K ! sdra , help our hero into a pair of hookboots . I am sure he is anxious to get started . '  |p105No  , look , I just came here to find my friends . I 'm sure there 's no  --  ' Rincewind began , as the dragonrider guided him firmly onto the platform , pushed him onto a seat , and proceeded to strap hookboots to his feet . Hurry up , K ! sdra . We must n't keep our hero from his destiny , ' said Lio ! rt . Look , I expect my friends are happy enough here , so if you could just , you know , set me down somewhere  --  ' You will see your friends soon enough , ' said the dragonlord airily . If you are religious , I mean . None who enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . Show him how to reach the rings , K ! sdra . ' Look what you 've got me into ! ' Rincewind hissed . Kring vibrated in his hand . Remember that I am a magic sword , ' it hummed . How can I forget ? ' Climb the ladder and grab a ring , ' said the dragonrider , then bring your feet up until the hooks catch . ' He helped the protesting wizard climb until he was hanging upside down , robe tucked into his britches , Kring dangling from one hand . At this angle the dragonfolklooked reasonably bearable but the dragons themselves , hanging from their perches , loomed over the scene like immense gargoyles . Their eyes glowed with interest . Attention , please , ' said Lio ! rt . A dragonrider handed him a long shape , wrapped in red silk . We fight to the death , ' he said . Yours . ' And I suppose I earn my freedom if I win ? ' said Rincewind , without much hope . Lio ! rt indicated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be naive , ' he said . Rincewind took a deep breath . I suppose I should warn you , ' he said , his voice hardly quavering at all , that this is a magic sword . ' Lio ! rt let the red silk wrapping drop away into the gloom and flourished a jet-black blade . Runes glowed on its surface . What a coincidence , ' he said , and lunged . Rincewind went rigid with fright , but his arm swung out as Kring shot forward . The swords met in an explosion of octarine light . Lio ! rt swung himself backwards , his eyes narrowing . Kring leapt past his guard and , although the dragonlord 's sword jerked up top106deflect most of the force , the result was a thin red line across its master 's torso . With a growl he launched himself at the wizard , boots clattering as he slid from ring to ring . The swords met again in another violent discharge of magic and , at the same time , Liolrt brought his other hand down against Rincewind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerked out of its ring and flailed desperately . Rincewind knew himself to be almost certainly the worst wizard on the discworld since he knew but one spell ; yet for all that he was still a wizard , and thus by the inexorable laws of magic this meant that upon his demise it would be Death himself who appeared to claim him ( instead of sending one of his numerous servants , as is usually the case ) . Thus it was that , as a grinning Liolrt swung back and brought his sword around in a lazy arc , time ran into treacle . To Rincewind 's eyes the world was suddenly lit by a flickering octarine light , tinged with violet as photons impacted on the sudden magical aura . Inside it the dragonlord was a ghastly-hued statue , his sword moving at a snail 's pace in the glow . Beside Lio ! rt was another figure , visible only to those who can see into the extra four dimensions of magic . It was tall and dark and thin and , against a sudden night of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharpness .. . Rincewind ducked . The blade hissed coldly through the air beside his head and entered the rock of the cavern roof without slowing . Death screamed a curse in his cold crypt voice . The scene vanished , What passed for reality on the discworld reasserted itself with a rush of sound . Lio ! rt gasped at the sudden turn of speed with which the wizard had dodged his killing stroke and , with that desperation only available to the really terrified , Rincewind uncoiled like a snake and launched himself across the space between them . He locked both hands around the dragonlord 's sword arm , and wrenched . It was at that moment that Rincewind 's one remaining ring , alreadyoverburdened , slid out of the rock with a nasty little metal sound . He plunged down , swung wildly , and ended up dangling over ap107bone-splintering death with his hands gripping the dragonlord 's arm so tightly that the man screamed . Lio ! rt looked up at his feet . Small flakes of rock were dropping out of the roof around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he screamed . Or we 'll both die ! ' Rincewind said nothing . He was concentrating on maintaining his grip and keeping his mind closed to the pressing images of his fate on the rocks below . Shoot him ! ' bellowed Lio ! rt . Out of the corner of his eye Rincewind saw several crossbows levelled at him . Lio ! rt chose that moment to flail down with his free hand , and a fistful of rings stabbed into the wizard 's fingers . He let go . Twoflower grabbed the bars and pulled himself up . See anything ? ' said Hrun , from the region of his feet . Just clouds . ' Hrun lifted him down again , and sat on the edge of one of the wooden beds that were the only furnishings in the cell . Bloody hell , ' he said . Do n't despair , ' said Twoflower . I 'm not despairing . ' I expect it 's all some sort of misunderstanding . I expect they 'll release us soon . They seem very civilised . ' Hrun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say something , then appeared to think better of it . He sighed instead . And when we get back we can say we 've seen dragons ! ' Twoflowercontinued . What about that , eh ? ' Dragons do n't exist , ' said Hrun flatly . ' Codice of Chimeria killed the last one two hundred years ago . I do n't know what we 're seeing , but they are n't dragons . ' But they carried us up in the air ! In that hall there must have been hundreds  --  ' I expect it was just magic , ' said Hrun , dismissively . Well , they looked like dragons , ' said Twoflower , an air of defiance about him . I always wanted to see dragons , ever since I was a little lad . Dragons flying around in the sky , breathing flames . . They just used to crawl around in swamps and stuff , and all theyp108breathed was stink , ' said Hrun , lying down in the bunk . They were n't very big , either . They used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to collect treasure , ' said Twoflower . IAnd firewood . Hey , ' Hrun added , brightening up , did you notice all those rooms they brought us through ? Pretty impressive , I thought . Lot of good stuff about , plus some of those tapestries have got to be worth a fortune . ' He scratched his chin thoughtfully , making a noise like a porcupine shouldering its way through gorse , What happens next ? ' asked Twoflower . Hrun screwed a finger in his ear and inspected it absently . Oh , ' he said , I expect in a minute the door will be flung back and I 'll be dragged off to some sort of temple arena where I 'll fight maybe a couple of giant spiders and an eight-foot slave from the jungles of Klatch and then I 'll rescue some kind of a princess from the altar and then kill off a few guards or whatever and then this girl will show me the secret passage out of the place and we 'll liberate a couple of horses and escape with the treasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked at the ceiling , whistling tunelessly . All that ? ' said Twoflower . Usually . ' Twoflower sat down on his bunk and tried to think . This proved difficult , because his mind was awash with dragons . Dragons ! Ever since he was two years old he had been captivated by the pictures of the fiery beasts in The Octarine Fairy Book . His sister had told him they did n't really exist , and he recalled the bitter disappointment . If the world did n't contain those beautiful creatures , he 'd decided , it was n't half the world it ought to be . And then later he had been bound apprentice to Ninereeds the Masteraccount , who in his grey-mindedness was everything that dragons were not , and there was no time for dreaming . But there was something wrong with these dragons . They were too small and sleek , compared to the ones in his mind 's eye . Dragons ought to be big and green and clawed and exotic and firebreathingbigand green with long sharp . . . Something moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , darkest corner of the dungeon . When he turned his head it vanished , although he thought he heard the faintest of noises that might have been made by claws scrabbling on stone.  |p109Hrun  ? ' he said . There was a snore from the other bunk . Twoflower padded over to the corner , poking gingerly at the stones in case there was a secret panel . At that moment the door was flung back , thumping against the wall . Half a dozen guards hurtled through it , spread out and flung themselves down on one knee . Their weapons were aimed exclusively at Hrun . When he thought about this later , Twoflower felt quite offended . Hrun snored . A woman strode into the room . Not many women can stride convincingly , but she managed it . She glanced briefly at Twoflower , as one might look at a piece of furniture , then glared down at the man on the bed . She was wearing the same sort of leather harness that the dragonridershad been wearing , but in her case it was much briefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fell to her waist , was her only concession to what even on the discworld passed for decency . She was also wearing a thoughtful expression . Hrun made a glubbing noise , turned over , and slept on . With a careful movement , as though handling some instrument of rare delicacy , t ' ' e woman drew a slim black dagger from her belt and stabbed downward . Before it was halfway through its arc Hrun 's right hand moved so fast that it appeared to travel between two points in space without at any time occupying the intervening air . It closed around the woman 's wrist with a dull smack . His other hand groped feverishly for a sword that was n't there . . . Hrun awoke. ' thigh ? ' he said , looking up at the woman with a puzzled frown . Then he caught sight of the bowmen . Let go , ' said the woman , in a voice that was calm and quiet and edsed with diamonds . Hrun released his grip slowly . She stepped back , massaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that a cat watches a mousehole . So , ' she said at last . You pass the first test . What is your name , barbarian ? ' Who are you calling a barbarian ? ' snarled Hrun . That is what I want to know . '  |p110Hrun  counted the bowmen slowly and made a brief calculation . His shoulders relaxed . I am Hrun of Chimeria . And you ? ' Liessa Dragonlady . ' You are the lord of this place ? ' That remains to be seen . You have the look about you of a hired sword , Hrun of Chimeria . I could use you  --  if you pass the tests , of course . There are three of them . You have passed the first . ' What are the other  --  ' Hrun paused , his lips moved soundlessly and then he hazarded , two ? ' Perilous . ' And the fee ? ' Valuable . ' Excuse me , ' said Twoflower . And if I fail these tests ? ' said Hrun , ignoring him . The air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their gazes sought for a hold . If you had failed the first test you would now be dead . This may be considered a typical penalty . ' Um , look , ' began Twoflower . Liessa spared him a brief glance , and appeared actually to notice him for the first time . Take that away , ' she said calmly , and turned back to Hrun . Two of the guards shouldered their bows , grasped Twoflower by the elbows and lifted him off the ground . Then they trotted smartly through the doorway . Hey , ' said Twoflower , as they hurried down the corridor outside , where ' ( as they stopped in front of another door ) is my ' ( as they dragged the door open ) Luggage ? ' He landed in a heap of what might once have been straw . The door banged shut , its echoes punctuatedby the sound of bolts being slammed home . In the other cell Hrun had barely blinked . Okay , ' he said , what is the second test ? ' You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both at the same time , or one after the other ? ' he said . Consecutively or concurrently , ' she assured him . What ? ' Just kill them , ' she said sharply . Good fighters , are they ? ' Renowned . '  |p111So  in return for all this . . . ? ' You will wed me and become Lord of the Wyrmberg . ' There was a long pause . Hrun 's eyebrows twisted themselves in unaccustomed calculation . I get you and this mountain ? ' he said at last . Yes . ' She looked him squarely in the eye , and her lips twitched . The fee is worthwhile , I assure you . ' Hrun dropped his gaze to the rings on her hand . The stones were large , being the incredibly rare blue milk diamonds from the clay basins of Mithos . When he managed to turn his eyes from them he saw Liessa glaring down at him in fury . ' So calculating ? ' she rasped . Hrun the Barbarian , who would boldly walk into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' he said , the only reason for walking into the jaws of Death is so 's you can steal His gold teeth . ' He brought one arm around expansively , and the wooden bunk was at the end of it . It cannoned into the bowmen and Hrun followed it joyously , felling one man with a blow and snatching the weapon from another . A moment later it was all over . Liessa had not moved . Well ? ' she said . Well what ? ' said Hrun , from the carnage . Do you intend to kill me ? ' What ? Oh no . No , this is just , you know , kind of a habit . Just keeping in practice . So where are these brothers ? ' He grinned . Twoflower sat on his straw and stared into the darkness . He wondered how long he had been there . Hours , at least . Days , probably . He speculated that perhaps it had been years , and he had simply forgotten . No , that sort of thinking would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trees , fresh air , dragons . Dragons . . . There was the faintest of scrabblings in the darkness . Twoflower felt the sweat prickle on his forehead . Something was in the cell with him . Something that made small noises , but even in the pitch blackness gave the impression of hugeness . He felt the air move . When he lifted his arm there was the greasy feel and faint showerp112of sparks that betokened a localised magical field . Twoflower found himself fervently wishing for light . A gout of flame rolled past his head and struck the far wall . As the rocks flashed into furnace heat he looked up at the dragon that now occupied more than half the cell . I obey , lord said a voice in his head . By the glow of the crackling , spitting stone Twoflower looked into his own reflection in two enormous green eyes . Beyond them the dragon was as multi-hued , horned , spiked and lithe as the one in his memory  --  a real dragon . Its folded wings were nevertheless still wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . It lay with him between its talons . Obey ? ' he said , his voice vibrating with terror and delight . Of course , lord . The glow faded away . Twoflower pointed a trembling finger at where he remembered the door to be and said , Open it ! ' The dragon raised its huge head . Again the ball of flame rolled out but this time , as the dragon 's neck muscles contracted , its colour faded from orange to yellow , from yellow to white , and finally to the faintest of blues . By that time the flame was also very thin , and where it touched the wall the molten rock spat and ran . When it reached the door the metal exploded into a shower of hot droplets . Black shadows arced and jiggered over the walls . The metal bubbledfor an eye-aching moment , and then the door fell in two pieces in the passage beyond . The flame winked out with a suddenness that was almost as startling as its arrival . Twoflower stepped gingerly over the cooling door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty . The dragon followed . The heavy door frame caused it some minor difficulty , which it overcame with a swing of its shoulders that tore the timber out and tossed it to one side . The creature looked expectantlyat Twoflower , its skin rippling and twitching as it sought to open its wings in the confines of the passage . How did you get in there ? ' said Twoflower . You summoned me , master . I do n't remember doing that . ' In your mind . You called me up , in your mind , thought the dragon , patiently . You mean I just thought of you and there you were ? '  |p113Yes  . It was magic ? ' Yes . But I 've thought about dragons all my life ! ' In this place the frontier between thought and reality is probably a little confused . All I know is that once I was not , and then you thought me , and then I was . Therefore , of course , I am yours to command . Good grief ! ' Half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the corridor . They stopped , open-mouthed . Then one remembered himselfsufficiently to raise his crossbow and fire . The dragon 's chest heaved . The quarrel exploded into flaming fragments in mid-air . The guards scurried out of sight . A fraction of a second later a wash of flame played over the stones where they had been standing . Twoflower looked up in admiration . Can you fly too ? ' he said . Of course . Twoflower glanced up and down the corridor , and decided against following the guards . Since he knew himself to be totally lost already , any direction was probably an improvement . He edged past the dragon and hurried away , the huge beast turning with difficulty to follow him . They padded down a series of passages that criss-crossed like a maze . At one point Twoflower thought he heard shouts , a long way behind them , but they soon faded away . Sometimes the dark arch of a crumbling doorway loomed past them in the gloom . Light filtered through dimly from various shafts and , here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into angles of the passage . Sometimesthere was a brighter glow from a distant light-well . What was odd , thought Twoflower as he strolled down a wide flight of stairs and kicked up billowing clouds of silver dust motes , was that the tunnels here were much wider . And better constructed , too . There were statues in niches set in the walls , and here and there faded but interesting tapestries had been hung . They mainly showed dragons  --  dragons by the hundred , in flight or hanging from their perch rings , dragons with men on their backs hunting down deer and , sometimes , other men . Twoflower touched one tapestry gingerly . The fabric crumbled instantly in the hot dry air , leaving only ap114dangling mesh where some threads had been plaited with fine gold wire . I wonder why they left all this ? ' he said . I do n't know , said a polite voice in his head . He turned and looked up into the scaley horse face above him . What is your name , dragon ? ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall call you Ninereeds . ' That is my name , then . They waded through the all-encroaching dust in a series of huge , dark-pillared halls which had been carved out of the solid rock . With some cunning too ; from floor to ceiling the walls were a mass of statues , gargoyles , bas-reliefs and fluted columns that cast weirdlymovingshadows when the dragon gave an obliging illumination at Twoflower 's request . They crossed the lengthy galleries and vast carven amphitheatres , all awash with deep soft dust and completely uninhabited . No-one had come to these dead caverns in centuries . Then he saw the path , leading away into yet another dark tunnel mouth . Someone had been using it regularly , and recently . It was a deep narrow trail in the grey blanket . Twoflower followed it . It led through still more lofty halls and winding corridors quite big enough for a dragon ( and dragons had come this way once , it seemed ; there was a room full of rotting harness , dragon-sized , and another room containing plate and chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of green bronze doors , each so high that they disappeared into the gloom . In front of Twoflower , at chest height , was a small handle shaped like a brass dragon . When he touched it the doors swung open instantly and with a disconcerting noiselessness . Instantly sparks crackled in Twoflower 's hair and there was a sudden gust of hot dry wind that did n't disturb the dust in the way that ordinary wind should but , instead , whipped it up momentarily into unpleasantly half-living shapes before it settled again . In Twoflower'sears came the strange shrill twittering of the Things locked in the distant dungeon Dimensions , out beyond the fragile lattice of time and space . Shadows appeared where there was nothing to cause them . The air buzzed like a hive . In short , there was a vast discharge of magic going on around him.  |p115The  chamber beyond the door was lit by a pale green glow . Stacked around the walls , each on its own marble shelf , were tier upon tier of coffins . In the centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dais , and it contained a slumped figure which did not move but said , in a brittle old voice , Come in , young man . ' Twoflower stepped forward . The figure in the seat was human , as far as he could make out in the murky light , but there was something about the awkward way it was sprawled in the chair that made him glad he could n't see it any clearer . I 'm dead , you know , ' came a voice from what Twoflower ferventlyhoped was a head , in conversational tones . ' I expect you can tell . ' Urn , ' said Twoflower . Yes . ' He began to back away . Obvious , is n't it ? ' agreed the voice . You 'd be Twoflower , would n't you ? Or is that later ? ' Later ? ' said Twoflower . Later than what ? ' He stopped . Well , ' said the voice . You see , one of the advantages of being dead is that one is released as it were from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has happened or will happen , all at the same time except that of course I now know that Time does not , for all practical purposes , exist . ' That does n't sound like a disadvantage , ' said Twoflower . You do n't think so ? Imagine every moment being at one and the same time a distant memory and a nasty surprise and you 'll see what I mean . Anyway , I now recall what it was I am about to tell you . Or have I already done so ? That 's a fine looking dragon , by the way . Or do n't I say that yet ? ' It is rather good . It just turned up , ' said Twoflower . ' It turned up ? ' said the voice . ' You summoned it ! ' Yes , well , all I did  --  ' You have the Power ! ' All I did was think of it . ' That 's what the Power is ! Have I already told you that I am Greicha the First ? Or is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't had too much experience of transcendence . Anyway , yes  --  the Power . It summons dragons , you know . ' I think you already told me that , ' said Twoflower . Did I ? I certainly intended to , ' said the dead man.  |p116But  how does it ? I 've been thinking about dragons all my life , but this is the first time one has turned up . ' Oh well , you see , the truth of the matter is that dragons have never existed as you ( and , until I was poisoned some three months ago , I ) understand existence . I 'm talking about the true dragon , draconis nobilis , you understand ; the swamp dragon , draconis vulgaris , is a base creature and not worth our consideration . The true dragon , on the other hand , is a creature of such refinement of spirit that they can only take on form in this world if they are conceived by the most skilled imagination . And even then the said imagination must be in some place heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the world of the seen and unseen . Then the dragons pop through , as it were , and impress their form on this world 's possibility matrix . I was very good at it when I was alive . I could imagine up to , oh , five hundred dragons at a time . Now Liessa , the most skilled of my children , can barely imagine fifty rather nondescriptcreatures . So much for a progressive education . She does n't really believe in them . That 's why her dragons are rather boring  --  while yours , ' said the voice of Greicha , ' is almost as good as some of mine used to be . A sight for sore eyes , not that I have any to speak of now. , Twoflower said hurriedly , You keep saying you 're dead ... ' Well ? ' Well , the dead , er , they , you know , do n't talk much . As a rule . ' ' I used to be an exceptionally powerful wizard . My daughter poisoned me , of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , ' the corpse sighed , or at least a sigh came from the air a few feet above it , it soon became obvious that none of my three children is sufficiently powerful to wrest the lordship of the Wyrmberg from the other two . A most unsatisfactory arrangement . A kingdom like ours has to have one ruler . So I resolved to remain alive in an unofficial capacity , which of course annoys them all immensely . I wo n't give my children the satisfaction of burying me until there is only one of them left to perform the ceremony . ' There was a nasty wheezing noise . Twoflower decided that it was meant to be a chuckle . So it was one of them that kidnapped us ? ' said Twoflower . Liessa , ' said the dead wizard 's voice . My daughter . Her power isp117strongest , you know . My sons ' dragons are incapable of flying more than a few miles before they fade . ' Fade ? I did notice that we could see through the one that brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a bit odd . ' ' Of course , ' said Greicha . The Power only works near the Wyrmberg . It 's the inverse square law , you know . At least , I think it is . As the dragons fly further away they begin to dwindle . Otherwise my little Liessa would be ruling the whole world by now , if I know anything about it . But I can see I must n't keep you . I expect you 'll be wanting to rescue your friend . ' Twoflower gaped . ' H run ? ' he said . Not him . The skinny wizard . My son Lio ! rt is trying to hack him to pieces . I admired the way you rescued him . Will , I mean . ' Twoflower drew himself up to his full height , an easy task . Where is he ? ' he said , heading towards the door with what he hoped was an heroic stride . Just follow the pathway in the dust , ' said the voice . Liessa comes to see me sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my little girl . She was the only one with the strength of character to murder me . A chip off the old block . Good luck , by the way . I seem to recall I said that . Will say it now , I mean . ' The rambling voice got lost in a maze of tenses as Twoflower ran along the dead tunnels , with the dragon loping along easily behind him . But soon he was leaning against a pillar , completely out of breath . It seemed ages since he 'd had anything to eat . Why do n't you fly ? said Ninereeds , inside his head . The dragon spread its wings and gave an experimental flap , which lifted it momentarilyoff the ground . Twoflower stared for a moment , then ran forward and clambered quickly onto the beast 's neck . Soon they were airborne , the dragon skimming along easily a few feet from the floor and leaving a billowing cloud of dust in its wake . Twoflower hung on as best he could as Ninereeds swooped through a succession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have accommodated a retreating army . At the top they emerged into the more inhabited regions , the mirrors at every corridor corner brightly polished and reflecting a pale light . I smell other dragons . The wings became a blur and Twoflower was jerked back as the dragon veered and sped off down a side corridor like a gnat-crazedp118swallow . Another sharp turn sent them soaring out of a tunnel mouth in the side of a vast cavern . There were rocks far below , and up above were broad shafts of light from great holes near the roof . A lot of activity on the ceiling , too . . . as Ninereeds hovered , thumpingthe air with his wings , Twoflower peered up at the shapes of roosting beasts and tiny men-shaped dots that were somehow walkingupside down . This is a roosting hall , said the dragon in a satisfied tone . As Twoflower watched , one of the shapes far above detached itself from the roof and began to grow larger . . . Rincewind watched as Lio ! rt 's pale face dropped away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his mind , why am I rising ? Then he began to tumble in the air and reality took over . He was dropping to the distant , guano-speckled rocks . His brain reeled with the thought . The words of the Spell picked just that moment to surface from the depths of his mind , as they always did in time of crisis . Why not say us , they seemed to urge . What have you got to lose ? Rincewind waved a hand in the gathering slipstream . Ashonai , ' he called . The word formed in front of him in a cold blue flame that streamed in the wind . He waved the other hand , drunk with terror and magic . Ebiris , ' he intoned . The sound froze into a flickering orange word that hung beside its companion . Urshoring . Kvanti . Pythan . N'gurad . Feringomalee . ' As the words blazed their rainbow colours around him he flung his hands back and prepared to say the eighth and final word that would appearin coruscating octarine and seal the spell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The breath was knocked out of him , the spell scattered and snuffed out . A pair of arms locked around his waist and the whole world jerked sideways as the dragon rose out of its long dive , claws grazing just for a moment the topmost rock on the Wyrmberg 's noisome floor . Twoflower laughed triumphantly . Got him ! ' And the dragon , curving gracefully at the top of his flight , gave ap119lazy flip of his wings and soared through a cavemouth into the morningair . At noon , in a wide green meadow on the lush tableland that was the top of the impossibly-balanced Wyrmberg , the dragons and their riders formed a wide circle . There was room beyond them for a rabble of servants and slaves and others who scratched a living here on the roof of the world , and they were all watching the figures clustered in the centre of the grassy arena . The group contained a number of senior dragonlords , and among them were Lio ! rt and his brother Liartes . The former was still rubbing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side stood Liessa and Hrun , with some of the woman 's own followers . Between the two factions stood the Wyrmberg 's hereditary Loremaster . As you know , ' he said uncertainly , the not-fully-late Lord of the Wyrmberg , Greicha the First , has stipulated that there will be no succession until one of his children feels himself  --  or as it might be , herself  --  powerful enough to challenge and defeat his or her siblings in mortal combat . ' Yes , yes , we know all that . Get on with it , ' said a thin peevish voice from the air beside him . The Loremaster swallowed . He had never come to terms with his former master 's failure to expire properly . Is the old buzzard dead or is n't he ? he wondered . It is not certain , ' he quavered , whether it is allowable to issue a challenge by proxy  --  ' It is , it is , ' snapped Greicha 's disembodied voice . It shows intelligence . Do n't take all day about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the brothers , both at once . ' Lio ! rt and Liartes exchanged looks . You 'll fight us both together ? ' said Liartes , a tall , wiry man with long black hair . Yah . ' That 's pretty uneven odds , is n't it ? ' Yah . I outnumber you one to two . ' Lio ! rt scowled . You arrogant barbarian  --  ' That just about does it ! ' growled Hrun . ' I ' 11  --  ' The Loremaster put out a blue-veined hand to restrain him.  |p120It  is forbidden to fight on the Killing Ground , ' - he said , and paused while he considered the sense of this . You know what I mean , anyway , ' he hazarded , giving up , and added As the challengedparties my lords Lio ! rt and Liartes have choice of weapons . ' Dragons , ' they said together . Liessa snorted . Dragons can be used offensively , therefore they are weapons , ' said Lio ! rt firmly . ' If you disagree we can fight over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nodding at Hrun . The Loremaster felt a ghostly finger prod him in the chest . Do n't stand there with your mouth open , ' said Greicha 's graveyardvoice . Just hurry up , will you ? ' Hrun stepped back , shaking his head . Oh no , ' he said . Once was enough . I 'd rather be dead than fight on one of those things . ' Die , then , ' said the Loremaster , as kindly as he could manage . Lio ! rt and Liartes were already striding back across the turf to where the servants stood waiting with their mounts . Hrun turned to Liessa . She shrugged . Do n't I even get a sword ? ' he pleaded . A knife , even ? ' No , ' she said . I did n't expect this . ' She suddenly looked smaller , all defiance gone . I 'm sorry . ' You 're sorry ? ' Yes . I 'm sorry . ' Yes , I thought you said you 're sorry . ' Do n't glare at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragon to ride  --  ' No ! ' The Loremaster wiped his nose on a handkerchief , held the little silken square aloft for a moment , then let it fall . A boom of wings made Hrun spin around . Lio ! rt 's dragon was already airborne and circling around towards them . As it swooped low over the turf a billow of flame shot from its mouth , scoring a black streak across the grass that rushed towards Hrun . At the last minute he pushed Liessa aside , and felt the wild pain of the flame on his arm as he dived for safety . He rolled as he hit the ground , and flipped onto his feet again while he looked around franticallyfor the other dragon . It came in from one side , and Hrun was forced to take a badly judged standing jump to escape the flame . The dragon 's tail whipped around as it passed and caught him a stingingp121blow across the forehead . He pushed himself upright , shaking his head to make the wheeling stars go away . His blistered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for a second run , but slower this time to allow for the big man 's unexpected agility . As the ground drifted up he saw the barbarian standing stock still , chest heaving , arms hanging loosely by his sides . An easy target . As his dragon swooped away Lio ! rt turned his head , expecting to see a dreadfully big cinder . There was nothing there . Puzzled , Lio ! rt turned back . Hrun , heaving himself over the dragon 's shoulder scales with one hand and beating out his flaming hair with the other , presented himself to his view . Lio ! rt 's hand flew to his dagger , but pain had sharpenedHrun 's normally excellent reflexes to needle point . A backhand blow hammered into the dragonlord 's wrist , sending the dagger arcingaway towards the ground , and another caught the man full on the chin . The dragon , carrying the weight of two men , was only a few yards above the grass . This turned out to be fortunate , because at the moment Lio ! rt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried across the grass and helped Hrun stagger to his feet . He blinked at her . What happened ? What happened ? ' he said thickly . That was really fantastic ! ' she said . The way you turned that somersault in mid-air and everything ! ' Yah , but what happened ? ' It 's rather difficult to explain  --  ' Hrun peered up at the sky . Liartes , by far the most cautious of the two brothers , was circling high above them . Well , you 've got about ten seconds to try , ' he said . The dragons  --  ' Yah ? ' They 're imaginary . ' Like all these imaginary burns on my arm , you mean ? ' Yes . No ! ' she shook her head violently . I 'll have to tell you later ! ' Fine , if you can find a really good medium , ' snapped Hrun . Heglared up at Liartes , who was beginning to descend in wide sweeps.  |p122Just  listen , will you ? Unless my brother is conscious his dragon ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this  --  ' Run ! ' shouted Hrun . He threw her away from him and flung himself flat on the ground as Liartes ' dragon thundered by , leaving another smoking scar across the turf . While the creature sought height for another sweep Hrun scrambledto his feet and set off at a dead run for the woods at the edge of the arena . They were sparse , little more than a wide and overgrown hedge , but at least no dragon would be able to fly through them . It did n't try . Liartes brought his mount in to land on the turf a few yards away and dismounted casually . The dragon folded its wings and poked its head in among the greenery , while its master leaned against a tree and whistled tunelessly . ' I can burn you out , ' said Liartes , after a while . The bushes remained motionless . Perhaps you 're in that holly bush over there ? ' The holly bush became a waxy ball of flame . I 'm sure I can see movement in those ferns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're only prolonging it , barbarian . Why not give in now ? I 've burned lots of people ; it does n't hurt a bit , ' said Liartes , looking sideways at the bushes . The dragon continued through the spinney , incinerating every likely-looking bush and clump of ferns . Liartes drew his sword and waited . Hrun dropped from a tree and landed running . Behind him the dragon roared and crashed through the bushes as it tried to turn around , but Hrun was running , running , with his gaze fixed on Liartes and a dead branch in his hands . It is a little known but true fact that a two legged creature can usually beat a four legged creature over a short distance , simply because of the time it takes the quadruped to get its legs sorted out . Hrun heard the scrabble of claws behind him and then an ominous thump . The dragon had half-opened its wings and was trying to fly . As Hrun bore down on the dragonlord Liartes ' sword came up wickedly , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and the two men sprawled on the ground . The dragon roared . Liartes screamed as Hrun brought a knee upwards with anatomi/cal precision , but managed a wild blow that rebroke the barbarian 's nose for him . Hrun kicked away and scrambled to his feet , to find himself lookingup into the wild horse-face of the dragon , its nostrils distended . He lashed out with a foot and caught Liartes , who was trying to stand up , on the side of his head . The man slumped . The dragon vanished . The ball of fire that was billowing towards Hrun faded until , when it reached him , it was no more than a puff of warm air . Then there was no sound but the crackle of burning bushes . Hrun slung the unconscious dragonlord over his shoulder and set off at a trot back to the arena . Halfway there he found Lio ! rt sprawled on the ground , one leg bent awkwardly . He stooped and , with a grunt , hoisted the man onto his vacant shoulder . Liessa and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the meadow . The dragonwoman had quite recovered her composurenow , and looked levelly at Hrun as he threw the two men down on the steps before her . The people around her were standing in deferential poses , like a court . Kill them , ' she said . I kill in my own time , ' he said . In any case , killing unconscious people is n't right . ' I ca n't think of a more opportune time , ' said the Loremaster . Liessa snorted . Then I shall banish them , ' she said . Once they are beyond the reach of the Wyrmberg 's magic then they 'll have no Power . They 'll be simply brigands . Will that satisfy you ? ' Yes . ' I am surprised that you are so merciful , ba  --  Hrun . ' Hrun shrugged . ' A man in my position , he ca n't afford to be anything else , he 's got to consider his image . ' He looked around . Where 's tie next test , then ? ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you may leave now . If you pass the test , however , you will become Lord of the Wyrmberg and , of course , my lawful husband . ' Hrun met her gaze . He thought about his life , to date . It suddenly seemed to him to have been full of long damp nights sleeping under the stars , desperate fights with trolls , city guards , countless bandits and evil priests and , on at least three occasions , actual demigods  --   |p124and  for what ? Well , for quite a lot of treasure , he had to admit  --  but where had it all gone ? Rescuing beleaguered maidens had a certain passing reward , but most of the time he 'd finished up by setting them up in some city somewhere with a handsome dowry , because after a while even the most agreeable ex-maiden became possessive and had scant sympathy for his efforts to rescue her sister sufferers . In short , life had really left him with little more than a reputation and a network of scars . Being a lord might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , all these dragons and a good bunch of fighting men , a man could really be a contender . Besides , the wench was not uncomely . The third test ? ' she said . Am I to be weaponless again ? ' said Hrun . Liessa reached up and removed her helmet , letting the coils of red hair tumble out . Then she unfastened the brooch of her robe . Underneath , she was naked . As Hrun 's gaze swept over her his mind began to operate two notional counting machines . One assessed the gold in her bangles , the tiger-rubies that ornamented her toe-rings , the diamond spangle that adorned her navel , and two highly individual whirligigs of silver filigree . The other was plugged straight into his libido . Both producedtallies that pleased him mightily . As she raised a hand and proffered a glass of wine she smiled , and said , I think not . ' He did n't attempt to rescue you , ' Rincewind pointed out as a last resort . He clung desperately to Twoflower 's waist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dangerous angle . The new knowledge that the scaley back he was astride only existed as a sort of threedimensionaldaydream did not , he had soon realised , do anything at all for his ankle-wrenching sensations of vertigo . His mind kept straying towards the possible results of Twoflower losing his concentration . Not even Hrun could have prevailed against those crossbows , ' said Twoflower stoutly . As the dragon rose higher above the patch of woodland , where the three of them had slept a damp and uneasy sleep , the sun rose overp125the edge of the disc . Instantly the gloomy blues and greys of predawnwere transformed into a bright bronze river that flowed across the world , flaring into gold where it struck ice or water or a lightdam . ( Owing to the density of the magical field surrounding the disc , light itself moved at sub-sonic speeds ; this interesting property was well utilised by the Sorca people of the Great Nef , for example , who over the centuries had constructed intricate and delicate dams , and valleys walled with polished silica , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The scintillating reservoirs of the Nef , overflowing after several weeks of uninterrupted sunlight , were a truly magnificentsight from the air and it is therefore unfortunate that Twoflower and Rincewind did not happen to glance in that direction . ) In front of them the billion-ton impossibility that was the magicwroughtWyrmberg hung against the sky and that was not too bad , until Rincewind turned his head and saw the mountain 's shadow slowly unroll itself across the cloudscape of the world .. . What can you see ? ' said Twoflower to the dragon . I see fighting on the top of the mountain came the gentle reply . See ? ' said Twoflower . ' Hrun 's probably fighting for his life at this very moment . ' Rincewind was silent . After a moment Twoflower looked around . The wizard was staring intently at nothing at all , his lips moving soundlessly . Rincewind ? ' The wizard made a small croaking noise . I 'm sorry , ' said Twoflower . What did you say ? ' . . . all the way . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His eyes focused , looked puzzled for a moment , then widened in terror . He made the mistake of looking down . Aargh , ' he opined , and began to slide . Twoflower grabbed him . What 's the matter ? ' Rincewind tried shutting his eyes , but there were no eyelids to hisimagination and it was staring widely . Do n't you get scared of heights ? ' he managed to say . Twoflower looked down at the tiny landscape , mottled with cloud shadows . The thought of fear had n't actually occurred to him . No , ' he said . Why should I ? You 're just as dead if you fall from forty feet as you are from four thousand fathoms , that 's what I say . '  |p126Rincewind  tried to consider this dispassionately , but could n't see the logic of it . It was n't the actual falling , it was the hitting he .. . Twoflower grabbed him quickly . Steady on , ' he said cheerfully . We 're nearly there . ' I wish I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish I was back on the ground ! ' I wonder if dragons can fly all the way to the stars ? ' mused Twoflower . Now that would be something .. You 're mad , ' said Rincewind flatly . There was no reply from the tourist , and when the wizard craned around he was horrified to see Twoflower looking up at the paling stars with an odd smile on his face . Do n't you even think about it , ' added Rincewind , menacingly . The man you seek is talking to the dragonwoman said the dragon . Hmm ? ' said Twoflower , still looking at the paling stars . What ? ' said Rincewind urgently . Oh yes . Hrun , ' said Twoflower . I hope we 're in time . Dive now ! Go low ! ' Rincewind opened his eyes as the wind increased to a whistling gale . Perhaps they were blown open  --  the wind certainly made them impossible to shut . The flat summit of the Wyrmberg rose up at them , lurched alarmingly , then somersaulted into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods and fields blurred into a rushing patchwork . A brief silvery flash in the landscape may have been the little river that overflowed into the air at the plateau 's rim . Rincewind tried to force the memory out of his mind , but it was rather enjoying itself there , terrorising the other occupants and kicking over the furniture . I think not , ' said Liessa . Hrun took the wine cup , slowly . He grinned like a pumpkin . Around the arena the dragons started to bay . Their riders looked up . And something like a green blur flashed across the arena , and Hrun had gone . The winecup hung momentarily in the air , then crashed down on the steps . Only then did a single drop spill . This was because , in the instant of enfolding Hrun gently in his claws , Ninereeds the dragon had momentarily synchronised theirp127bodily rhythms . Since the dimension of the imagination is much more complex than those of time and space , which are very junior dimensions indeed , the effect of this was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hrun moving sideways at eighty miles an hour with no ill-effects whatsoever , except for a few wasted mouthfuls of wine . Another effect was to cause Liessa to scream with rage and summon her dragon . As the gold beast materialised in front of her she leapt astride it , still naked , and snatched a crossbow from one of the guards . Then she was airborne , while the other dragonridersswarmed towards their own beasts . The Loremaster , watching from the pillar he had prudently slid behind in the mad scramble , happened at that moment to catch the cross-dimensional echoes of a theory being at the same instant hatched in the mind of an early psychiatrist in an adjacent universe , possibly because the dimension-leak was flowing both ways , and for a moment the psychiatrist saw the girl on the dragon . The Loremastersmiled . Want to bet that she wo n't catch him ? ' said Greicha , in a voice of worms and sepulchres , right by his ear . The Loremaster shut his eyes and swallowed hard . I thought that my Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he managed . I am a wizard , ' said Greicha . Death Himself must claim a wizard . And , aha , He does n't appear to be in the neighbourhood . . SHALL WE GO ? asked Death . He was on a white horse , a horse of flesh and blood but red of eye and fiery of nostril , and He stretched out a bony hand and took Greicha 's soul out of the air and rolled it up until it was a point of painful light , and then He swallowed it . Then He clapped spurs to his steed and it sprang into the air , sparks coruscating from its hooves . Lord Greicha ! ' whispered the old Loremaster , as the universe flickered around him . That was a mean trick , ' came the wizard 's voice , a mere speck of sound disappearing into the infinite black dimensions . My Lord . . . what is Death like ? ' called the old man tremulously . When I have investigated it fully , I will let you know , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' murmured the Loremaster . A thought struck him . During daylight , please , ' he added . You clowns , ' screamed Hrun , from his perch on Ninereed 's foreclaws . What did he say ? ' roared Rincewind , as the dragon ripped its way through the air in the race for the heights . Did n't hear ! ' bellowed Twoflower , his voice torn away by the gale . As the dragon banked slightly he looked down at the little toy spinningtop that was the mighty Wyrmberg and saw the swarm of creaturesrising in pursuit . Ninereed 's wings pounded and flicked the air away contemptuously . Thinner air , too . Twoflower 's ear popped for the third time . Ahead of the swarm , he noticed , was a golden dragon . Someone on it , too . Hey , are you all right ? ' said Rincewind urgently . He had to drink in several lungfuls of the strangely distilled air in order to get the words out . I could have been a lord , and you clowns had to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air drew the life even out of his mighty chest . Wass happnin to the air ? ' muttered Rincewind . Blue lights appeared in front of his eyes. said Twoflower , and passed out . The dragon vanished . For a few seconds the three men continued upwards , Twoflower and the wizard presenting an odd picture as they sat one i front of the other with their legs astride something that was n't the . Then what passed for gravity on the Disc recovered from the surprise , and claimed them . At that moment Liessa 's dragon flashed by , and Hrun landed heavily across its neck . Liessa leaned over and kissed him . This detail was lost to Rincewind as he dropped away , with his arms still clasped around Twoflower 's waist . The disc was a little round map pinned against the sky . It did n't appear to be moving , but Rincewind knew that it was . The whole world was coming towards him like a giant custard pie . Wake up ! ' he shouted , above the roar of the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flurry of wings as they plummeted through the host of pursuing creatures , which fell away and up . Dragons screamed and wheeled across the sky . No answer came from Twoflower . Rincewind 's robe whipped around him , but he did not wake . Dragons , thought Rincewind in a panic . He tried to concentrate his mind , tried to envisage a really lifelike dragon . If he can do it , he thought , then so can I. But nothing happened . The disc was bigger now , a cloud-swirled circle rising gently underneaththem . Rincewind tried again , screwing up his eyes and straining every nerve in his body . A dragon . His imagination , a somewhat battered and over-used organ , reached out for a dragon . . . any dragon . IT WO N'T WORK , laughed a voice like the dull toning of a funereal bell , YOU DO N'T BELIEVE IN THEM . Rincewind looked at the terrible mounted apparition grinning at him , and his mind bolted in terror . There was a brilliant flash . There was utter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , a pink light around him , and the sudden shocked cries of many people . He looked around wildly . He was standing in some kind of tunnel , which was mostly filled with seats in which outlandishly-dressed people had been strapped . They were all shouting at him . Wake up ! ' he hissed . Help me ! ' Dragging the still-unconscious tourist with him he backed away from the mob until his free hand found an oddly-shaped door handle . He twisted it and ducked through , then slammed it hard . He stared around the new room in which he found himself and met the terrified gaze of a young woman who dropped the tray she was holding and screamed . It sounded like the sort of scream that brings muscular help . Rincewind , awash with fear-distilled adrenalin , turned and barged past her . There were more seats here , and the people in them ducked as he dragged Twoflower urgently along the central gangway . Beyondthe rows of seats were little windows . Beyond the windows , against a background of fleecy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver . I 've been eaten by a dragon , he thought . That 's ridiculous , hep130replied , you ca n't see out of dragons . Then his shoulder hit the door at the far end of the tunnel , and he followed it through into a coneshapedroom that was even stranger than the tunnel . It was full of tiny glittering lights . Among the lights , in contoured chairs , were four men who were now staring at him open-mouthed . As he stared back he saw their gazes dart sideways . Rincewind turned slowly . Beside him was a fifth man  --  youngish , bearded , as swarthy as the nomad folk of the Great Nef . Where am I ? ' said the wizard . In the belly of a dragon ? ' The young man crouched back and shoved a small black box in the wizard 's face . The men in the chairs ducked down . What is it ? ' said Rincewind . A picture box ? ' He reached out and took it , a movement which appeared to surprise the swarthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was another shout , this time from one of the men in the chairs . Only now he was n't sitting . He was standing up , pointing something small and metallic at the young man . It had an amazing effect . The man crouched back with his hands in the air . Please give me the bomb , sir , ' said the man with the metallic thing . Carefully , please . ' This thing ? ' said Rincewind . You have it ! I do n't want it ! ' The man took it very carefully and put it on the floor . The seated men relaxed , and one of them started speaking urgently to the wall . The wizard watched him in amazement . Do n't move ! ' snapped the man with the meti -- -an amulet , Rincewinddecided , it must be an amulet . The swarthy man backed into the corner . That was a very brave thing you did , ' said Amulet-holder to Rincewind . You know that ? ' What ? ' What 's the matter with your friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was still slumbering peacefully . That was no surprise . What was really surprising was that Twoflower was wearing new clothes . Strange clothes . His britches now ended just above his knees . Above that he wore some sort of vest of brightly-striped material . On his head was a ridiculous little straw hat . With a feather in it.  |p131An  awkward feeling around the leg regions made Rincewind look down . His clothes had changed too . Instead of the comfortable old robe , so marvellously well-adapted for speed into action in all possiblecontingencies , his legs were encased in cloth tubes . He was wearing a jacket of the same grey material .. . Until now he 'd never heard the language the man with the amulet was using . It was uncouth and vaguely Hublandish  --  so why could he understand every word ? Let 's see , they 'd suddenly appeared in this dragon after , they 'd materialised in this drag , they 'd sudd , they 'd , they 'd  --  they had struck up a conversation in the airport so naturally they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd promised to show Jack Zweiblumen around when they got back to the States . Yes , that was it . And then Jack had been taken ill and he 'd panicked and come through here and surprised this hijacker . Of course . What on earth was Hubland-ish ' ? Dr. Rjinswand rubbed his forehead . What he could do with was a drink . Ripples of paradox spread out across the sea of causality . Possibly the most important point that would have to be borne in mind by anyone outside the sum totality of the multiverse was that although the wizard and the tourist had indeed only recently appeared in an aircraft in mid-air , they had also at one and the same time been riding on that aeroplane in the normal course of things . That is to say : while it was true that they had just appeared in this particular set of dimensions , it was also true that they had been living in them all along . It is at this point that normal language gives up , and goes and has a drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materialised ( however , they had not . See below ) in a universe where they should not strictly had been . The usual upshot of this sort of thing is a vast explosion but , since universes are fairly resilient things , this particularuniverse had saved itself by instantaneously unravelling its spacetimecontinuum back to a point where the surplus atoms could safely be accommodated and then rapidly rewinding back to that circle of firelight which for want of a better term its inhabitants were wont to call The Present . This had of course changed history  --  there hadp132been a few less wars , a few extra dinosaurs and so on  --  but on the whole the episode passed remarkably quietly . Outside of this particular universe , however , the repercussions of the sudden double-take bounced to and fro across the face of The Sum of Things , bending whole dimensions and sinking galaxies without a trace . All this was however totally lost on Dr. Rjinswand , 33 , a bachelor , born in Sweden , raised in New Jersey , and a specialist in the breakawayoxidation phenomena of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have believed any of it . Zweiblumen still seemed to be unconscious . The stewardess , who had helped Rjinswand to his seat to the applause of the rest of the passengers , was bending over him anxiously . We 've radioed ahead , ' she told Rjinswand . There 'll be an ambulancewaiting when we land . Uh , it says on the passenger list that you 're a doctor  --  ' I do n't know what 's wrong with him , ' said Rjinswand hurriedly . It might be a different matter if he was a Magnox reactor of course . Is it shock of some kind ? ' I 've never  --  ' Her sentence terminated in a tremendous crash from the rear of the plane . Several passengers screamed . A sudden gale of air swept every loose magazine ag1 newspaper into a screaming whirlwind that twisted madly down the aisle . Something else was coming up the aisle . Something big and oblong and wooden and brass-bound . It had hundreds of legs . If it was what it seemed  --  a walking chest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold and jewels  --  then what would have been its lid suddenly gaped open . There were no jewels . But there were lots of big square teeth , white as sycamore , and a pulsating tongue , red as mahogany . An ancient suitcase was coming to eat him . Rjinswand clutched at the unconscious Zweiblumen for what little comfort there was there , and gibbered . He wished fervently that he was somewhere else . There was a sudden darkness . There was a brilliant flash . The sudden departure of several quintillion atoms from a universe that they had no right to be in anyway caused a wild imbalance inp133the harmony of the Sum Totality which it tried frantically to retrieve , wiping out a number of sub-realities in the process . Huge surges of raw magic boiled uncontrolled around the very foundations of the multiverse itself , welling up through every crevice into hitherto peaceful dimensions and causing novas , supernovas , stellar collisions , wild flights of geese and drowning of imaginary continents . Worlds as far away as the other end of time experienced brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atmosphere . In the cometary halo around the fabled Ice System of Zeret a noble comet died as a prince flamed across the sky . All this was however lost on Rincewind as , clutching the inert Twoflower around the waist , he plunged towards the Disc 's sea severalhundred feet below . Not even the convulsions of all the dimensionscould break the iron Law of the Conservation of Energy , and Rjinswand 's brief journey in the plane had sufficed to carry him several hundred miles horizontally and seven thousand feet vertically . The word plane ' flamed and died in Rincewind 's mind . Was that a ship down there ? The cold waters of the Circle Sea roared up at him and sucked him down into their green , suffocating embrace . A moment later there was another splash as the luggage , still bearing a label carrying the powerful travelling rune TWA , also hit the sea . Later on , they used it as a raft.  |p134It  had been a long time in the making . Now it was almost completed , and the slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where other slaves were industriously rubbing its metal flanks  --  with silver sand it was already beginning to gleam in the sun with the silken , organic sheen of young bronze . It was still warm , even after a week of cooling in the casting pit . The Arch-astronomer of Krull motioned lightly with his hand and his bearers set the throne down in the shadow of the hull . Like a fish , he thought . A great flying fish . And of what seas ? It is indeed magnificent , ' he whispered . ' A work of true art . ' Craft , ' said the thickset man by his side . The Arch-astronomer turned slowly and looked up at the man 's impassive face . It is n't particularly hard for a face to look impassive when there are two golden spheres where the eyes should be . They glowed disconcertingly . Craft , indeed , ' said the astronomer , and smiled . I would imagine that there is no greater craftsman on the entire disc than you , Goldeneyes . Would I be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  naked , at least , were itp135not for a toolbelt , a wrist abacus and a deep tan  --  tensing as he considered the implications of this last remark . The golden eyes appeared to be looking into some other world . The answer is both yes and no , ' he said at last . Some of the lesser astronomers behind the throne gasped at this lack of etiquette , but the Arch-astronomer appeared not to have noticed it . Continue , ' he said . There are some essential skills that I lack . Yet I am Goldeneyes Silverhand Dactylos , ' said the craftsman . I made the Metal Warriors that guard the Tomb of Pitchiu , I designed the Light Dams of the Great Nef , I built the Palace of the Seven Deserts . And yet  --  ' he reached up and tapped one of his eyes , which rang faintly , when I built the golem army for Pitchiu he loaded me down with gold and then , so that I would create no other work to rival my work for him , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said the Arch-astronomer sympathetically . Yah . So I learned to hear the temper of metals and to see with my fingers . I learned how to distinguish ores by taste and smell . I made these eyes , but I can not make them see . Next I was summoned to build the Palace of the Seven Deserts , as a result of which the Emir showered me with silver and then , not entirely to my surprise , had my right hand cut off . ' A grave hindrance in your line of business , ' nodded the Archastronomer . I used some of the silver to make myself this new hand , putting to use my unrivalled knowledge of levers and fulcrums . It suffices . After I created the first great Light Dam , which had a capacity of 50,000 daylight hours , the tribal councils of the Nef loaded me down with fine silks and then hamstrung me so that I could not escape . As a result I was put to some inconvenience to use the silk and some bamboo to build a flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turret of my prison . ' Bringing you , by various diversions , to Krull , ' said the Archastronomer . And one can not help feeling that some alternative occupation  --  lettucefarming , say  --  would offer somewhat less of a risk of being put to death by instalments . Why do you persist in it ? ' Goldeneyes Dactylos shrugged . I 'm good at it , ' he said.  |p136The  Arch-astronomer looked up again at the bronze fish , shining now like a gong in the noontime sun . Such beauty , ' he murmured . And unique . Come , Dactylos . Recallto me what it was that I promised should be your reward ? ' You asked me to design a fish that would swim through the seas of space that lie between the worlds , ' intoned the master craftsman . In return for which  --  in return  --  ' Yes ? My memory is not what it used to be , ' purred the Archastronomer , stroking the warm bronze . In return , ' continued Dactylos , without much apparent hope , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any appendages . I require no treasure . ' Ah , yes . I recall now . ' The old man raised a blue-veined hand , and added , I lied . ' There was the merest whisper of sound , and the golden-eyed man rocked on his feet . Then he looked down at the arrowhead protrudingfrom his chest , and nodded wearily . A speck of blood bloomed on his lips . There was no sound in the entire square ( save for the buzzing of a few expectant flies ) as his silver hand came up , very slowly , and fingered the arrowhead . Dactylos grunted . Sloppy workmanship , ' he said , and toppled backwards . The Arch-astronomer prodded the body with his toe , and sighed . There will be a short period of mourning , as befits a master craftsman , ' he said . He watched a bluebottle alight on one golden eye and fly away puzzled . . . That would seem to be long enough , ' said the Arch-astronomer , and beckoned a couple of slaves to carry the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . The master launchcontroller bustled forward . Indeed , your prominence , ' he said . The correct prayers are being intoned ? ' Quite so , your prominence . ' How long to the doorway ? ' The launch window , ' corrected the master launchcontroller carefully . Three days , your prominence . Great A'Tuin 's tail will be in an unmatched position . '  |p137Then  all that remains , ' concluded the Arch-astronomer , ' is to find the appropriate sacrifices . ' The master launchcontroller bowed . The ocean shall provide , ' he said . The old man smiled . It always does , ' he said . If only you could navigate  --  ' If only you could steer  --  ' A wave washed over the deck . Rincewind and Twoflower looked at each other . Keep bailing ! ' they screamed in unison , and reached for the buckets . After a while Twoflower 's peevish voice filtered up from the waterloggedcabin . I do n't see how it 's my fault , ' he said . He handed up another bucket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be on watch , ' snapped Rincewind . I saved us from the slavers , remember , ' said Twoflower . I 'd rather be a slave than a corpse , ' replied the wizard . He straightened up and looked out to sea . He appeared puzzled . He was a somewhat different Rincewind from the one that escaped the fire of Ankh-Morpork some six months before . More scarred , for one thing , and much more travelled . He had visited the Hublands , discovered the curious folkways of many colourful peoples  --  invariablyobtaining more scars in the process  --  and had even , for a neverto-be-forgottenfew days , sailed on the legendary Dehydrated Ocean at the heart of the incredibly dry desert known as the Great Nef . On a colder and wetter sea he had seen floating mountains of ice . He had ridden on an imaginary dragon . He had very nearly said the most powerful spell on the disc . He had -- there was definitely less horizon than there ought to be . Hmm ? ' said Rincewind . ' I said nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth opened as the wizard flung his bucket far out to sea and sat down heavily on the waterlogged deck , his face a grey mask . Look , I 'm sorry I steered us into the reef , but this boat does n't seem to want to sink and we 're bound to strike land sooner or later , ' said Twoflower comfortingly . This current must go somewhere . ' Look at the horizon , ' said Rincewind , in a monotone.  |p138Twoflower  squinted . ' It looks all right , ' he said after a while . ' Admittedly , there seems to be less than there usually is , but  --  ' ' That 's because of the Rimfall , ' said Rincewind . ' We 're being carriedover the edge of the world . ' There was a long silence , broken only by the lapping of the waves as the foundering ship spun slowly in the current . It was already quite strong . ' That 's probably why we hit that reef , ' Rincewind added . ' We got pulled off course during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat ? ' asked Twoflower . He began to rummage through the bundle that he had tied to the rail , out of the damp . ' Do n't you understand ? ' snarled Rincewind . ' We are going over the Edge , godsdammit ! ' ' Ca n't we do anything about it ? ' ' No ! ' ' Then I ca n't see the sense in panicking , ' said Twoflower calmly . ' I knew we should n't have come this far Edgewise , ' complained Rincewind to the sky , ' I wish  --  ' ' I wish I had my picture-box , ' said Twoflower , ' but it 's back on that slaver ship with the rest of the Luggage and  --  ' You wo n't need luggage where we 're going , ' said Rincewind . He sagged , and stared moodily at a distant whale that had carelessly strayed into the rimward current and was now struggling against it . There was a line of white on the foreshortened horizon , and the wizard fancied he could hear a distant roaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rimfall ? ' said Twoflower . ' Who knows ? ' ' Well , in that case perhaps we 'll just sail on through space and land on another world . ' A faraway look came into the little man 's eyes . ' I 'd like that , ' he said . Rincewind snorted . The sun rose in the sky , looking noticeably bigger this close to the Edge . They stood with their backs against the mast , busy with their own thoughts . Every so often one or other would pick up a bucket and do a bit of desultory bailing , for no very intelligent reason . The sea around them seemed to be getting crowded . Rincewindp139noticed several tree trunks keeping station with them , and just below the surface the water was alive with fish of all sorts . Of course  --  the current must be teeming with food washed from the continents near the Hub . He wondered what kind of life it would be , having to keep swimming all the time to stay exactly in the same place . Pretty similarto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green frog which was paddling desperately in the grip of the inexorable current . To Twoflower'samazement he found a paddle and carefully extended it towards the little amphibian , which scrambled onto it gratefully . A moment later a pair of jaws broke the water and snapped impotently at the spot where it had been swimming . The frog looked up at Rincewind from the cradle of his hands , and then bit him thoughtfully on the thumb . Twoflower giggled . Rincewindtucked the frog away in a pocket , and pretended he had n't heard . All very humanitarian , but why ? ' said Twoflower . It 'll all be the same in an hour . ' Because , ' said Rincewind vaguely , and did a bit of bailing . Spray was being thrown up now and the current was so strong that waves were forming and breaking all around them . It all seemed unnaturallywarm . There was a hot golden haze on the sea . The roaring was louder now . A squid bigger than anything Rincewindhad seen before broke the surface a few hundred yards away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somethingelse that was large and fortunately unidentifiable howled in the mist . A whole squadron of flying fish tumbled up in a cloud of rainbow-edgeddroplets and managed to gain a few yards before droppingback and being swept away in an eddy . They were running out of world . Rincewind dropped his bucket and snatched at the mast as the roaring , final end of everything raced towards them . I must see this  --  ' said Twoflower , half falling and half diving towards the prow . Something hard and unyielding smacked into the hull , which spun ninety degrees and came side-on to the invisible obstacle . Then it stopped suddenly and a wash of cold sea foam cascaded over the deck , so that for a few seconds Rincewind was under several feet of boiling green water . He began to scream and then the underwater world became the deep clanging purple colour of fading conscious/ness , because it was at about this point that Rincewind started to drown . He awoke with his mouth full of burning liquid and , when he swallowed , the searing pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boards of a boat pressed into his back and Twoflower was looking down at him with an expression of deep concern . Rincewind groaned , and sat up . This turned out to be a mistake . The edge of the world was a few feet away . Beyond it , at a level just below that of the lip of the endless Rimfall , was something altogether magical . Some seventy miles away , and well beyond the tug of the rim current , a dhow with the red sails typical of a freelance slaver drifted aimlessly through the velvety twilight . The crew  --  such as remained  --  were clustered on the foredeck , surrounding the men working feverishlyon the raft . The captain , a thickset man who wore the elbow-turbans typical of a Great Nef tribesman , was much travelled and had seen many strange peoples and curious things , many of which he had subsequentlyenslaved or stolen . He had begun his career as a sailor on the Dehydrated Ocean in the heart of the disc 's driest desert . ( Water on the disc has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strange desiccating effects of octarine light ; it dehydrates , leaving a silvery residue like free-flowing sand through which a well-designed hull can glide with ease . The Dehydrated Ocean is a strange place , but not so strange as its fish . ) The captain had never before been really frightened . Now he was terrified . I ca n't hear anything , ' he muttered to the first mate . The mate peered into the gloom . Perhaps it fell overboard ? ' he suggested hopefully . As if in answer there came a furious pounding from the oar deck below their feet , and the sound of splintering wood . The crewmen drew together fearfully , brandishing axes and torches . They probably would n't dare to use them , even if the Monsterp141came rushing towards them . Before its terrible nature had been truly understood several men had attacked it with axes , whereupon it had turned aside from its single-minded searching of the ship and had either chased them overboard or had  --  eaten them ? The captain was not quite certain . The Thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger than usual , maybe , but not suspiciously so . But while it sometimes seemed to contain things like old socks and miscellaneousluggage , at other times  --  and he shuddered  --  it seemed to be , seemed to be , seemed to have . . . He tried not to think about it . It was just that the men who had been drowned overboard had probably been more fortunate than those it had caught . He tried not to think about it . There had been teeth , teeth like white wooden gravestones , and a tongue red as mahogany . . . He tried not to think about it . It did n't work . But he thought bitterly about one thing . This was going to be the last time he rescued ungrateful drowning men in mysterious circumstances . Slavery was better than sharks , was n't it ? And then they had escaped and when his sailors had investigated their big chest  --  how had they appeared in the middle of an untroubled ocean sitting on a big chest , anyway ?  --  and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it again , but he found himself wondering what would happen when the damned thing realised that its owner was n't on board any longer . . . Raft 's ready , lord , ' said the first mate . Into the water with it , ' shouted the captain , and Get aboard ! ' and Fire the ship ! ' After all , another ship would n't be too hard to come by , he philosophised , but a man might have to wait a long time in that Paradise the mullahs advertised before he was granted another life . Let the magical box eat lobsters . Some pirates achieved immortality by great deeds of cruelty or derring-do . Some achieved immortality by amassing great wealth . But the captain had long ago decided that he would , on the whole , prefer to achieve immortality by not dying . What the hell is that ? ' demanded Rincewind . It 's beautiful , ' said Twoflower beatifically . I 'll decide about that when I know what it is , ' said the wizard.  |p142It  is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear , and you are fortunate indeed to be looking at it . From above , at any rate . ' The voice was accompanied by a gust of cold , fishy breath . Rincewindsat quite still . Twoflower ? ' he said . Yes ? ' If I turn around , what will I see ? ' His name is Tethis . He says he 's a sea troll . This is his boat . He rescued us , ' explained Twoflower . Will you look around now ? ' Not just at the moment , thank you . So why are n't we going over the Edge , then ? ' asked Rincewind with glassy calmness . Because your boat hit the Circumfence , ' said the voice behind him ( in tones that made Rincewind imagine submarine chasms and lurkingThings in coral reefs ) . The Circumfence ? ' he repeated . Yes . It runs along the edge of the world , ' said the unseen troll . Above the roar of the waterfall Rincewind thought he could make out the splash of oars . He hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' said Rincewind . The circumferencemakes the edge of things . ' So does the Circumfence , ' said the troll . He means this , ' said Twoflower , pointing down . Rincewind 's eyes followed the finger , dreading what they might see .. . Hubwards of the boat was a rope suspended a few feet above the surface of the white water . The boat was attached to it , moored yet mobile , by a complicated arrangement of pulleys and little wooden wheels . They ran along the rope as the unseen rower propelled the craft along the very lip of the Rimfall . That explained one mystery  --  but what supported the rope ? Rincewind peered along its length and saw a stout wooden post sticking up out of the water a few yards ahead . As he watched the boat neared it and then passed it , the little wheels clacking neatly around it in a groove obviously cut for the purpose . Rincewind also noticed that smaller ropes hung down from the main rope at intervals of a yard or so . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , ' he said , but what is it ? ' Twoflower shrugged . Behind Rincewind the sea troll said , Upp143when we are there . Now I mustrow . Rincewind found that looking ahead meant that he would have to turn and find out what a sea troll actually looked like , and he was n't sure he wanted to do that yet . He looked at the Rimbow instead . It hung in the mists a few lengths beyond the edge of the world , appearing only at morning and evening when the light of the Disc 's little orbiting sun shone past the massive bulk of Great A'Tuin the World Turtle and struck the Disc 's magical field at exactly the right angle . A double rainbow coruscated into being . Close into the lip of the Rimfall were the seven lesser colours , sparkling and dancing in the spray of the dying seas . But they were pale in comparison to the wider band that floated beyond them , not deigning to share the same spectrum . It was the King Colour , of which all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was octarine , the colour of magic . It was alive and glowing and vibrant and it was the undisputedpigment of the imagination , because wherever it appeared it was a sign that mere matter was a servant of the powers of the magical mind . It was enchantment itself . But Rincewind always thought it looked a sort of greenish-purple . After a while a small speck on the rim of the world resolved itself into a eyot or crag , so perilously perched that the waters of the fall swirled around it at the start of their long drop . A driftwood shanty had been built on it , and Rincewind saw that the top rope of the Circumfence climbed over the rocky island on a number of iron stakes and actually passed through the shack by a small round window . He learned later that this was so that the troll could be alerted to the arrival of any salvage on his stretch of the Circumfence by means of a series of small bronze bells , balanced delicately on the rope . A crude floating stockade had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the island . It contained one or two hulks and quite a large amount of floating wood in the form of planks , baulks and even whole natural tree trunks , some still sporting green leaves . This close to the Edge the Disc 's magical field was so intense that ap144hazy corona flickered across everything as raw illusion spontaneouslydischarged itself . With a last few squeaky jerks the boat slid up against a small driftwood jetty . As it grounded itself and formed a circuit Rincewind felt all the familiar sensations of a huge occult aura  --  oily , bluishtasting , and smelling of tin . All around them pure , unfocused magic was sleeting soundlessly into the world . The wizard and Twoflower scrambled onto the planking and for the first time Rincewind saw the troll . It was n't half so dreadful as he had imagined . Umm , said his imagination after a while . It was n't that the troll was horrifying . Instead of the rotting , betentacled monstrosity he had been expecting Rincewind found himself looking at a rather squat but not particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal on any city street , always provided that other people on the street were used to seeing old men who were apparently composed of water and very little else . It was as if the ocean had decided to create life without going through all that tedious business of evolution , and had simply formed a part of itself into a biped and sent it walking squishily up the beach . The troll was a pleasant translucent blue colour . As Rincewind stared a small shoal of silver fish flashed across its chest . It 's rude to stare , ' said the troll . Its mouth opened with a little crest of foam , and shut again in exactly the same way that water closes over a stone . Is it ? Why ? ' asked Rincewind . How does he hold himself together , his mind screamed at him . Why does n't he spill ? If you will follow me to my house I will find you food and a change of clothing , ' said the troll solemnly . He set off over the rocks without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , where else could they go ? It was getting dark , and a chilly damp breeze was blowing over the edge of the world . Already the transient Rimbow had faded and the mists above the waterfall were beginning to thin . Come on , ' said Rincewind , grabbing Twoflower 's elbow . But the tourist did n't appear to want to move . Come on , ' the wizard repeated . When it gets really dark , do you think we 'll be able to look down and see Great A'Tuin the World Turtle ? ' asked Twoflower , staring at the rolling clouds.  |p145I  hope not , ' said Rincewind , I really do . Now let 's go , shall we ? ' Twoflower followed him reluctantly into the shack . The troll had lit a couple of lamps and was sitting comfortably in a rocking chair . He got to his feet as they entered and poured two cups of a green liquid from a tall pitcher . In the dim light he appeared to phosphoresce , in the manner of warm seas on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rincewind 's dull terror he seemed to be severalinches taller , too . Most of the furniture in the room appeared to be boxes . Uh . Really great place you 've got here , ' said Rincewind . Ethnic . ' He reached for a cup and looked at the green pool shimmeringinside it . It 'd better be drinkable , he thought . Because I 'm going todrink it . He swallowed . It was the same stuff Twoflower had given him in the rowing boat but , at the time , his mind had ignored it because there were more pressing matters . Now it had the leisure to savour the taste . Rincewind 's mouth twisted . He whimpered a little . One of his legs came up convulsively and caught him painfully in the chest . Twoflower swirled his own drink thoughtfully while he considered the flavour . Ghlen Livid , ' he said . The fermented vu ! nut drink they freezedistilin my home country . A certain smokey quality . . . Piquant . From the western plantations in , ah , Rehigreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy , from the colour . May I ask how you came by it ? ' ( Plants on the disc , while including the categories known commonlyas annuals , which were sown this year to come up later this year , biennials , sown this year to grow next year , and perennials , sown this year to grow until further notice , also included a few rare re-annuals which , because of an unusual four-dimensional twist in their genes , could be planted this year to come up last year . The vu ! nut vine was particularly exceptional in that it could flourish as many as eight years prior to its seed actually being sown . Vul nut wine was reputed to give certain drinkers an insight into the future which was , from the nut 's point of view , the past . Strange but true . ) All things drift into the Circumfence in time , ' said the troll , gnomically , gently rocking in his chair . ' My job is to recover the flotsam . Timber , of course , and ships . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '  |p146Light  dawned inside Rincewind 's head . It 's a net , is n't it ? You 've got a net right on the edge of the sea ! ' The Circumfence , ' nodded the troll . Ripples ran across his chest . Rincewind looked out into the phosphorescent darkness that surrounded the island , and grinned inanely . Of course , ' he said . Amazing ! You could sink piles and attach it to reefs and  --  good grief ! The net would have to be very strong . ' It is , ' said Tethis . It could be extended for a couple of miles , if you found enough rocks and things , ' said the wizard . Ten thousands of miles . I just patrol this league . ' That 's a third of the way around the disc ! ' Tethis sloshed a little as he nodded again . While the two men helped themselves to some more of the green wine , he told them about the Circumfence , the great effort that had been made to build it , and the ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , and the seven navies that patrolledit constantly to keep it in repair and bring its salvage back to Krull , and the manner in which Krull had become a land of leisure ruled by the most learned seekers after knowledge , and the way in which they sought constantly to understand in every possible particularthe wondrous complexity of the universe , and the way in which sailors marooned on the Circumfence were turned into slaves , and usually had their tongues cut out . After some interjections at this point he spoke , in a friendly way , on the futility of force , the impossibilityof escaping from the island except by boat to one of the other three hundred and eighty isles that lay between the island and Krull itself , or by leaping over the Edge , and the high merit of muteness in comparison to , for example , death . There was a pause . The muted night-roar of the Rimfall only served to give the silence a heavier texture . Then the rocking chair started to creak again . Tethis seemed to have grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this , ' he added . I too am a slave . If you try to overpower me I shall have to kill ycu , of course , but I wo n't take any particular pleasure in it . ' Rincewind looked at the shimmering fists that rested lightly in the troll 's lap . He suspected they could strike with all the force of a tsunami.  |p147I  do n't think you understand , ' explained Twoflower . I am a citizenof the Golden Empire . I 'm sure Krull would not wish to incur the displeasure of the Emperor . ' How will the Emperor know ? ' asked the troll . ' Do you think you 're the first person from the Empire who has ended up on the Circumfence ? ' I wo n't be a slave ! ' shouted Rincewind . ' I 'd  --  I 'd jump over the Edge first ! ' He was amazed at the sound in his own voice . Would you , though ? ' asked the troll . The rocking chair flicked back against the wall and one blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later the troll was striding out of the shack with Rincewind gripped carelessly in one fist . He did not stop until he came to the Rimward edge of the island . Rincewind squealed . Stop that or I really will throw you over the edge , ' snapped the troll . I 'm holding you , are n't I ? Look . ' , Rincewind looked . In front of him was a soft black night whose mist-muted stars glowed peacefully . But his eyes turned downwards , drawn by some irresistible fascination . It was midnight on the Disc and so , therefore , the sun was far , far below , swinging slowly under Great A'Tuin 's vast and frosty plastron . Rincewind tried a last attempt to fix his gaze on the tips of his boots , which were protruding over the rim of the rock , but the sheer drop wrenched it away . On either side of him two glittering curtains of water hurtled towardsinfinity as the sea swept around the island on its way to the long fall . A hundred yards below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself out of the foam in a wild , jerky and ultimately hopeless leap . Then it fell back , over and over , in the golden underworld light . Huge shadows grew out of that light like pillars supporting the roof of the universe . Hundreds of miles below him the wizard made out the shape of something , the edge of somethingLike those curious little pictures where the silhouette of an ornate glass suddenly becomes the outline of two faces , the scene beneath him flipped into a whole , new , terrifying perspective . Because down there was the head of an elephant as big as a reasonably-sized continent . One mighty tusk cut like a mountain against the golden light ,  |p148trailing  a widening shadow towards the stars . The head was slightly tilted , and a huge ruby eye might almost have been a red supergiant that had managed to shine at noonday . Below the elephantRincewind swallowed and tried not to thinkBelow the elephant there was nothing but the distant , painful disc of the sun . And , sweeping slowly past it , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its lunar cragginess , was indubitablya flipper . Shall I let go ? ' suggested the troll . Gnah , ' said Rincewind , straining backwards . I have lived here on the Edge for five years and I have not had the courage , ' boomed Tethis . Nor have you , if I 'm any judge . ' He stepped back , allowing Rincewind to fling himself onto the ground . Twoflower strolled up to the rim and peered over . Fantastic , ' he said . If only I had my picture box . . . What else is down there ? I mean , if you jumped off , what would you see ? ' Tethis sat down on an outcrop . High over the disc the moon came out from behind a cloud , giving him the appearance of ice . My home is down there , perhaps , ' he said slowly . Beyond your silly elephants and that ridiculous turtle . A real world . Sometimes I come out here and look , but somehow I can never bring myself to take that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real people . I have wives and little ones , somewhere down there . . . ' He stopped , and blew his nose . You soon learn what you 're made of , here on the Edge . ' Stop saying that . Please , ' moaned Rincewind . He turned over and saw Twoflower standing unconcernedly at the very lip of the rock . Gnah , ' he said , and tried to burrow into the stone . There 's another world down there , ' said Twoflower , peering over . Where , exactly ? ' The troll waved an arm vaguely . Somewhere , ' he said . That 's all I know . It was quite a small world . Mostly blue . ' So why are you here ? ' said Twoflower . Is n't it obvious ? ' snapped the troll . I fell off the edge ! ' He told them of the world of Bathys , somewhere among the stars , where the seafolk had built a number of thriving civilisations in thep149three large oceans that sprawled across its disc . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earned a perilous living in large , sailpoweredland yachts that ventured far out to land and hunted the shoals of deer and buffalo that abounded in the storm-haunted continents . His particular yacht had been blown into uncharted lands by a freak gale . The rest of the crew had taken the yacht 's little rowing trolley and had struck out for a distant lake , but Tethis , as master , had elected to remain with his vessel . The storm had carried it right over the rocky rim of the world , smashing it to matchwood in the process . At first I fell , ' said Tethis , but falling is n't so bad , you know . It 's only the landing that hurts , and there was nothing below me . As I fell I saw the world spin off into space until it was lost against the stars . ' What happened next ? ' said Twoflower breathlessly , glancing towards the misty universe . I froze solid , ' said Tethis simply . Fortunately it is something my race can survive . But I thawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one , I think it was the one with what I thought was this strange ring of mountains around it that turned out to be the biggest dragon you could ever imagine , covered in snow and glaciers and holding its tail in its mouth  --  well , I came within a few leagues of that , I shot over the landscape like a comet , in fact , and then I was off again . Then there was a time I woke up and there was your world coming at me like a custard pie thrown by the Creatorand , well , I landed in the sea not far from the Circumfence widdershins of Krull . All sorts of creatures get washed up against the Fence , and at the time they were looking for slaves to man the way stations , and I ended up here . ' He stopped and stared intently at Rincewind . Every night I come out here and look down , ' he finished , and I never jump . Courage is hard to come by , here on the Edge . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a little scream as the troll picked him up , not unkindly , and set him on his feet . Amazing , ' said Twoflower , and leaned further out over the Edge . There are lots of other worlds out there ? ' Quite a number , I imagine , ' said the troll . I suppose one could contrive some sort of , I do n't know , somep150sort of a thing that could preserve one against the cold , ' said the little man thoughtfully . Some sort of a ship that one could sail over the Edge and sail to far-off worlds , too . I wonder .. Do n't even think about it ! ' moaned Rincewind . Stop talking like that , do you hear ? ' They all talk like that in Krull , ' said Tethis . Those with tongues , of course , ' he added . Are you awake ? ' Twoflower snored on . Rincewind jabbed him viciously in the ribs . I said , are you awake ? ' he snarled . ' Scrdfngh .. We 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' The dishwater light of dawn oozed through the shack 's one window , slopping across the piles of salvaged boxes and bundles that were strewn around the interior . Twoflower grunted again and tried to burrow into the pile of furs and blankets that Tethis had given them . Look , there 's all kinds of weapons and stuff in here , ' said Rincewind . He 's gone out somewhere . When he comes back we could overpower him and  --  and  --  well , then we can think of something . How about it ? ' That does n't sound like a very good idea , ' said Twoflower . ' Anyhow , it 's a bit ungracious is n't it ? ' Tough buns , ' snapped Rincewind . This is a rough universe . ' He rummaged through the piles around the walls and selected a heavy , wavy-bladed scimitar that had probably been some pirate 's pride and joy . It looked the sort of weapon that relied as much on its weight as its edge to cause damage . He raised it awkwardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could hurt him ? ' Twoflower wondered aloud . Rincewind ignored him and took up a position beside the door . When it opened some ten minutes later he moved unhesitatingly , swinging it across the opening at what he judged was the troll 's head height . It swished harmlessly through nothing at all and struck the doorpost , jerking him off his feet and onto the floor . There was a sigh above him . He looked up into Tethis ' face , which was shaking sadly from side to side.  |p151It  would n't have harmed me , ' said the troll , but nevertheless I am hurt . Deeply hurt . ' He reached over the wizard and jerked the sword out of the wood . With no apparent effort he bent its blade into a circle and sent it bowling away over the rocks until it hit a stone and sprang , still spinning , in a silver arc that ended in the mists forming over the Rimfall . Very deeply hurt , ' he concluded . He reached down beside the door and tossed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deer that is just about how you humans like it , and a few lobsters , and a sea salmon . The Circumfence provides , ' he said casually . He looked hard at the tourist , and then down again at Rincewind . What are you staring at ? ' he said . It 's just that  --  ' said Twoflower.  --  compared to last night  --  ' said Rincewind . You 're so small , ' finished Twoflower . I see , ' said the troll carefully . Personal remarks now . ' He drew himself up to his full height , which was currently about four feet . Just because I 'm made of water does n't mean I 'm made of wood , you know . ' I 'm sorry , ' said Twoflower , climbing hastily out of the furs . You 're made of dirt , ' said the troll , but I did n't pass comments about things you ca n't help , did I ? Oh , no . We ca n't help the way the Creator made us , that 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is rather more powerful than the ones around my own world . ' The moon ? ' said Twoflower . I do n't under  --  ' If I 've got to spell it out , ' said the troll , testily , I 'm suffering from chronic tides . ' A bell jangled in the darkness of the shack . Tethis strode across the creaking floor to the complicated devices of levers , strings and bells that was mounted on the Circumfence 's topmost strand where it passed through the hut . The bell rang again , and then started to clang away in an odd jerky rhythm for several minutes . The troll stood with his ear pressed close to it . When it stopped he turned slowly and looked at them with a worried frown . You 're more important than I thought , ' he said . You 're not to wait for the salvage fleet . You 're to be collected by a flyer . That'sp152what they say in Krull . ' He shrugged . And I had n't even sent a message that you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine again . ' He picked up a large mallet that hung on a pillar beside the bell and used it to tap out a brief carillon . That 'll be passed from lengthman to lengthman all the way back to Krull , ' he said . Marvellous really , is n't it ? ' It came speeding across the sea , floating a man-length above it , but still leaving a foaming wake as whatever power that held it up smacked brutally into the water . Rincewind knew what power held it up . He was , he would be the first to admit , a coward , an incompetent , and not even very good at being a failure ; but he was still a wizard of sorts , he knew one of the Eight Great Spells , he would be claimed by Death himself when he died , and he recognised really finely honed magic when he saw it . The lens skimming towards the island was perhaps twenty feet across , and totally transparent . Sitting around its circumference were a large number of black-robed men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harness and each one staring down at the waves with an expression so tormented , so agonising , that the transparent disc seemed to be ringed with gargoyles . Rincewind sighed with relief . This was such an unusual sound that it made Twoflower take his eyes off the approaching disc and turn them on him . ' We 're important , no lie , ' explained Rincewind . They would n't be wasting all that magic on a couple of potential slaves . ' He grinned . ' What is it ? ' said Twoflower . ' Well , the disc itself would have been created by Fresnel 's WonderfulConcentrator , ' said Rincewind , authoritatively . ' That calls for many rare and unstable ingredients , such as demon 's breath and so forth , and it takes at least eight fourth-grade wizards a week to envision . Then there 's those wizards on it , who must all be gifted hydrophobes  --  ' ' You mean they hate water ? ' said Twoflower . ' No , that would n't work , ' said Rincewind . ' Hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really loathe it , the very idea of it revolts them . A really good hydrophobe has to be trained on dehydratedp153water from birth . I mean , that costs a fortune in magic alone . But they make great weather magicians . Rain clouds just give up and go away . ' It sounds terrible , ' said the water troll behind them . And they all die young , ' said Rincewind , ignoring him . They just ca n't live with themselves . ' Sometimes I think a man could wander across the disc all his life and not see everything there is to see , ' said Twoflower . And now it seems there are lots of other worlds as well . When I think I might die without seeing a hundredth of all there is to see it makes me feel , ' he paused , then added , well , humble , I suppose . And very angry , of course . ' The flyer halted a few yards hubward of the island , throwing up a sheet of spray . It hung there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the exact centre of the lens beckoned to them . You 'd better wade out , ' said the troll . It does n't do to keep them waiting . It has been nice to make your acquaintance . ' He shook them both , wetly , by the hand . As he waded out a little way with them the two nearest loathers on the lens shied away with expressions of extremedisgust . The hooded figure reached down with one hand and released a rope ladder . In its other hand it held a silver rod , which had about it the unmistakable air of something designed for killing people . Rincewind'sfirst impression was reinforced when the figure raised the stick and waved it carelessly towards the shore . A section of rock vanished , leaving a small grey haze of nothingness . That 's so you do n't think I 'm afraid to use it , ' said the figure . Do n't think you 're afraid ? ' said Rincewind . The hooded figure snorted . We know all about you , Rincewind the magician . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh in the face of Death . Your affected air of craven cowardice does not fool me . ' It fooled Rincewind . I  --  ' he began , and paled as the nothingnessstickwas turned towards him . ' I see you know all about me , ' he finished weakly , and sat down heavily on the slippery surface . He and Twoflower , under instructions from the hooded commander , strapped themselves down to rings set in the transparent disc . ' If you make the merest suggestion of weaving a spell , ' said thep154darkness under the hood , you die . Third quadrant reconcile , ninth quadrant redouble , forward all ! ' A wall of water shot into the air behind Rincewind and the disc jerked suddenly . The dreadful presence of the sea troll had probably concentrated the hydrophobes ' minds wonderfully , because it then rose at a very steep angle and did n't begin level flight until it was a dozen fathoms above the waves . Rincewind glanced down through the transparent surface and wished he had n't . Well , off again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waved at the troll , now no more than a speck on the edge of the world . Rincewind glared at him . Does n't anything ever worry you ? ' he asked . We 're still alive , are n't we ? ' asked Twoflower . And you yourself said they would n't be going to all this trouble if we were just going to be slaves . I expect Tethis was exaggerating . I expect it 's all a misunderstanding . I expect we 'll be sent home . After we 've seen Krull , of course . And I must say it all sounds fascinating . ' Oh yes , ' said Rincewind , in a hollow voice . Fascinating . ' He was thinking : I 've seen excitement , and I 've seen boredom . And boredom was best . Had either of them happened to look down at that moment they would have noticed a strange v-shaped wave surging through the water far below them , its apex pointing directly at Tethis ' island . But they were n't looking . The twenty-four hydrophobic magicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of dreadfulness , not really any different from the liquid horror around it . They were probably right . Sometime before all this the blazing pirate ship had hissed under the waves and started the long slow slide towards the distant ooze . It was more distant than average , because directly under the stricken keel was the Gorunna Trench  --  a chasm in the Disc 's surface that was so black , so deep and so reputedly evil that even the krakens went there fearfully , and in pairs . In less reputedly evil chasms the fish went about with natural lights on their heads and on the whole managed quite well . In Gorunna they left them unlit and , insofar asp155it is possible for something without legs to creep , they crept ; they tended to bump into things , too . Horrible things . The water around the ship turned from green to purple , from purple to black , from black to a darkness so complete that blackness itself seemed merely grey by comparison . Most of its timbers had already been crushed into splinters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightmare polyps and drifting forests of seaweed which glowed with faint , diseased colours . Things brushed it briefly with soft , cold tentacles as they darted away into the freezing silence . Something rose up from the murk and ate it in one mouthful . Some time later the islanders on a little rimward atoll were amazed to find , washed into their little local lagoon , the wave-rocked corpse of a hideous sea monster , all beaks , eyes and tentacles . They were further astonished at its size , since it was rather larger than their village . But their surprise was tiny compared to the huge , stricken expression on the face of the dead monster , which appeared to have been trampled to death . Somewhat further rimward of the atoll a couple of little boats , trolling a net for the ferocious free-swimming oysters which abounded in those seas , caught something that dragged both vessels for several miles before one captain had the presence of mind to sever the lines . But even his bewilderment was as nothing compared to that of the islanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following night they were awakened by a terrific crashing and splintering noise coming from their minute jungle ; when some of the bolder spirits went to investigate in the morning they found that the trees had been smashed in a broad swathe that started on the hubmost shore of the atoll and made a line of total destruction pointing precisely Edgewise , littered with broken lianas , crushed bushes and a few bewilderedand angry oysters . They were high enough now to see the wide curve of the Rim sweepingaway from them , lapped by the fluffy clouds that mercifully hid the waterfall for most of the time . From up here the sea , a deep blue dappled with cloud-shadows , looked almost inviting . Rincewind shuddered.  |p156Excuse  me , ' he said . The hooded figure turned from its contemplation of the distant haze and raised its wand threateningly . I do n't want to use this , ' it said . You do n't ? ' said Rincewind . What is it , anyway ? ' said Twoflower . Ajandurah 's Wand of Utter Negativity , ' said Rincewind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It might go off , ' he added , nodding at the wand 's glittering point . I mean , it 's all very flattering , all this magic being used just for our benefit , but there 's no need to go quite that far . And  --  ' Shut up . ' The figure reached up and pulled back its hood , revealingitself to be a most unusually tinted young woman . Her skin was black . Not the dark brown of Urabewe , or the polished blueblackof monsoon-haunted Klatch , but the deep black of midnight at the bottom of a cave . Her hair and eyebrows were the colour of moonlight . There was the same pale sheen around her lips . She looked about fifteen , and very frightened . Rincewind could n't help noticing that the hand holding the wand was shaking ; this was because a piece of sudden death , wobbling uncertainly a mere five feet from your nose , is very hard to miss . It dawned on him  --  very slowly , because it was a completely new sensation  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completereverse was so often the case that he had come to think of it as a kind of natural law . What is your name ? ' he said , as reassuringly as he could manage . She might be frightened , but she did have the wand . If I had a wand like that , he thought , I would n't be frightened of anything . So what in Creation can she imagine I could do ? My name is immaterial , ' she said . That 's a pretty name , ' said Rincewind . Where are you taking us , and why ? I ca n't see any harm in your telling us . ' You are being brought to Krull , ' said the girl . And do n't mock me , hublander . Else I 'll use the wand . I must bring you in alive , but no-one said anything about bringing you in whole . My name is Marchesa , and I am a wizard of the fifth level . Do you understand ? ' Well , since you know all about me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neophyte , ' said Rincewind . I 'm not even a wizard , really . ' He caught Twoflower 's astonished expression , and added hastily , Just a wizard of sorts . '  |p157You  ca n't do magic because one of the Eight Great Spells is indeliblylodged in your mind , ' said Marchesa , shifting her balance gracefullyas the great lens described a wide arc over the sea . That 's why you were thrown out of Unseen University . We know . ' But you said just now that he was a magician of great cunning and artifice , ' protested Twoflower . Yes , because anyone who survives all that he has survived  --  most of which was brought on himself by his tendency to think of himself as a wizard  --  well , he must be some kind of a magician , ' said Marchesa . I warn you , Rincewind . If you give me the merest suspicion that you are intoning the Great Spell I really will kill you . ' She scowled at him nervously . Seems to me your best course would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere , ' said Rincewind . I mean , thanks for rescuing us and everything , so if you 'd just let us get on with leading our lives I 'm sure we 'd all  --  ' I hope you 're not proposing to enslave us , ' said Twoflower . Marchesa looked genuinely shocked . Certainly not ! Whatever could have given you that idea ? Your lives in Krull will be rich , full and comfortable  --  ' Oh good , ' said Rincewind. '  --  just not very long . ' Krull turned out to be a large island , quite mountainous and heavily wooded , with pleasant white buildings visible here and there among the trees . The land sloped gradually up towards the rim , so that the highest point in Krull in fact slightly overhung the Edge . Here the Krullians had built their major city , also called Krull , and since so much of their building material had been salvaged from the Circumfencethe houses of Krull had a decidedly nautical persuasion . To put it bluntly , entire ships had been morticed artfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caravels protrudedat strange angles from the general wooden chaos . Painted figureheads and hublandish dragonprows reminded the citizens of Krull that their good fortune stemmed from the sea ; barquentines and carracks lent a distinctive shape to the larger buildings . And so the city rose tier on tier between the blue-green ocean of the Disc and the soft cloud sea of the Edge , the eight colours of the Rimbowp158reflected in every window and in the many telescope lenses of the city 's multitude of astronomers . ' It 's absolutely awful , ' said Rincewind gloomily . The lens was approaching now along the very lip of the rimfall . The island not only got higher as it neared the Edge . It got narrower too , so that the lens was able to remain over water until it was very near the city . The parapet along the edgewise cliff was dotted with gantries projecting into nothingness . The lens glided smoothly towardsone of them and docked with it as smoothly as a boat might glide up to a quay . Four guards , with the same moonlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They did not appear to be armed , but as Twoflower and Rincewind stumbled onto the parapetthey were each grabbed by the arms and held quite firmly enough for any thought of escape to be instantly dismissed . Then Marchesa and the watching hydrophobic wizards were quickly left behind and the guards and their prisoners set off briskly along a lane that wound between the ship-houses . Soon it led downwards , into what turned out to be a palace of some sort , half-hewn out of the rock of the cliff itself . Rincewind was vaguely aware of brightly-lit tunnels , and courtyards open to the distant sky . A few elderly men , their robes covered in mysterious occult symbols , stood aside and watched with interest as the sextet passed . Several times Rincewind noticed hydrophobes  --  their ingrained expressions of selfrevulsionat their own body-fluids was distinctive  --  and here and there trudging men who could only be slaves . He did n't have much time to reflect on all this before a door was opened ahead of them and they were pushed , gently but firmly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rincewind and Twoflower regained their balance and stared around the room in which they now found themselves . ' Gosh , ' said Twoflower ineffectually , after a pause during which he had tried unsuccessfully to find a better word . ' This is a prison cell ? ' wondered Rincewind aloud . ' All that gold and silk and stuff , ' Twoflower added . ' I 've never seen anything like it ! ' In the centre of the richly-decorated room , on a carpet that was so deep and furry that Rincewind trod on it gingerly lest it be some kind of shaggy , floor-loving beast , was a long gleaming table laden with food . Most were fish dishes , including the biggest and **25;12781;TOOLONG lobster Rincewind had ever seen , but there were also plenty of bowls and platters piled with strange creations that he had never seen before . He reached out cautiously and picked up some sort of purple fruit crusted with green crystals . Candied sea urchin , ' said a cracked , cheerful voice behind him . A great delicacy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man had stepped out from behind the heavy curtains . He was tall , thin and looked almost benign compared to some of the faces Rincewind had seen recently . The puree of sea cucumbers is very good too , ' said the face , conversationally . Those little green bits are baby starfish . ' Thank you for telling me , ' said Rincewind weakly . Actually , they 're rather good , ' said Twoflower , his mouth full . I thought you liked seafood ? ' Yes , I thought I did , ' said Rincewind . What 's this wine  --  crushed octopus eyeballs ? ' Sea grape , ' said the old man . Great , ' said Rincewind , and swallowed a glassful . Not bad . A bit salty , maybe . ' Sea grape is a kind of small jellyfish , ' explained the stranger . And now I really think I should introduce myself . Why has your friend gone that strange colour ? ' Culture shock , I imagine , ' said Twoflower . What did you say your name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garhartra . I 'm the Guestmaster , you see . It is my pleasant task to make sure that your stay here is as delightful as possible . ' He bowed . ' If there is anything you want you have only to say . ' Twoflower sat down on an ornate mother-of-pearl chair with a glass of oily wine in one hand and a crystallised squid in the other . He frowned . I think I 've missed something along the way , ' he said . First we were told we were going to be slaves  --  ' A base canard ! ' interrupted Garhartra . What 's a canard ? ' said Twoflower . ' I think it 's a kind of duck , ' said Rincewind from the far end of the long table . Are these biscuits made of something really nauseating , do you suppose ? '  |  --  and then we were rescued at great magical expense  --  ' They 're made of pressed seaweed , ' snapped the Guestmaster.  --  but then we 're threatened , also at a vast expenditure ofmagic  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seaweed , ' agreed Rincewind . They certainly taste like seaweed would taste if anyone was masochistic enough to eat seaweed . ' '  --  and then we 're manhandled by guards and thrown in here  --  2 ' Pushed gently , ' corrected Garhartra.  --  which turned out to be this amazingly rich room and there 's all this food and a man saying he 's devoting his life to making us happy , ' Twoflower concluded . What I 'm getting at is this sort of lack of consistency . ' Yar , ' said Rincewind . What he means is , are you about to start being generally unpleasant again ? Is this just a break for lunch ? ' Garhartra held up his hands reassuringly . Please , please , ' he protested . It was just necessary to get you here as soon as possible . We certainly do not want to enslave you . Please be reassured on that score . ' Well , fine , ' said Rincewind . Yes , you will in fact be sacrificed , ' Garhartra continued placidly . Sacrificed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wizard . Kill ? Yes , of course . Certainly ! It would hardly be a sacrifice if we did n't , would it ? But do n't worry  --  it 'll be comparatively painless . ' Comparatively ? Compared to what ? ' said Rincewind . He picked up a tall green bottle that was full of sea grape jellyfish wine and hurled it hard at the Guestmaster , who flung up a hand as if to protect himself . There was a crackle of octarine flame from his fingers and the air suddenly took on the thick , greasy feel that indicated a powerful magical discharge . The flung bottle slowed and then stopped in midair , rotating gently . At the same time an invisible force picked Rincewind up and hurled him down the length of the room , pinning him awkwardly halfway up the far wall with no breath left in his body . He hung there with his mouth open in rage and astonishment . Garhartra lowered his hand and brushed it slowly on his robe . I did n't enjoy doing that , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' muttered Rincewind.  |p161But  what do you want to sacrifice us for ? ' asked Twoflower . You hardly know us ! ' That 's rather the point , is n't it ? It 's not very good manners to sacrifice a friend . Besides , you were , urn , specified . I do n't know a lot about the god in question , but He was quite clear on that point . Look , I must be running along now . So much to organise , you know how it is , ' the Guestmaster opened the door , and then peered back around it . Please make yourselves comfortable , and do n't worry . ' But you have n't actually told us anything ! ' wailed Twoflower . It 's not really worth it , is it ? What with you being sacrificed in the morning , ' said Garhartra , it 's hardly worth the bother of knowing , really . Sleep well . Comparatively well , anyway . ' He shut the door . A brief octarine flicker of balefire around it suggested that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locksmith . Gling , clang , tang went the bells along the Circumfence in the moonlit , rimfall-roaring night . Terton , lengthman of the 45th Length , had n't heard such a clashingsince the night a giant kraken had been swept into the Fence five years ago . He leaned out of his hut , which for the lack of any convenienteyot on this Length had been built on wooden piles driven into the sea bed , and stared into the darkness . Once or twice he thought he could see movement , far off . Strictly speaking , he should row out to see what was causing the din . But here in the clammy darkness it did n't seem like an astoundingly good idea , so he slammed the door , wrapped some sacking around the madly jangling bells , and tried to get back to sleep . That did n't work , because even the top strand of the Fence was thrumming now , as if something big and heavy was bouncing on it . After staring at the ceiling for a few minutes , and trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , Terton blew out the lantern and opened the door a crack . Something was coming along the Fence , in giant loping bounds that covered metres at a time . It loomed up at him and for a moment Terton saw something rectangular , multi-legged , shaggy with seaweedand  --  although it had absolutely no features from which he could have deduced this  --  it was also very angry indeed. **26;12808;TOOLONG lump in bed was only a shell of that former self , but she was more than ever sure that surgery could repair and save him , revitalize him , enable him to make fantastic love with her for the rest of their lives , giving them not only children but an eternity of fleshly pleasures . Having put on her nightgown and turned off the lights , she snuggled down on her side of the bed and was soon enveloped by sleep . She had no idea how many hours she had slept . She only knew that it must be well into morning as she gradually opened her eyes to the sun 's glare . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tulip trees outside the bedroom window , then yawning herself fully awake she rolled over toward Ken 's side of the bed to speak to him . He was not in bed , his place empty , but she was not surprised . He 'd had enough sleep and was probably in the living room having breakfast or lolling on the sofa perhaps reading through the Zola novel . Throwing back her covers , Amanda sat up and swung off the bed . Stepping into her bedroom slippers , she decided to see Ken before brushing her teeth and showering . She clumped into the next room , calling out , " Ken , how are you ? " No answer . She looked around . He was n't there . She turned toward the balcony where he might be having breakfast . He was n't there either . Probably he had wanted a breath of air and she would find him outside . She had started toward the bedroom when , out of the corner of her eye , she caught sight of a piece of paper Scotch-taped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what it was , and saw at once it was a piece of the cream-colored hotel stationery and she recognized Ken 's scrawled handwriting on it . She tore the note free and read what Ken had written : Amanda , dear meddling dear , Goddammit , do n't you try anything like this again . You believe what you believe , and let me believe what I believe . But just do n't try to obstruct my beliefs . I do n't think you have the slightest notion of the depth of my faith . I believe in **30;12836;TOOLONG with the Holy Mother , I believe in the Immaculate Conception , I believe that the Virgin Mary will return , I believe in every one of the cures She has given to the blessed ones . I hope to be one of them  --  not only for my sake , but Jr ous . On the day you can prove  --  prove  --  my faith is wrong , I might listen . But otherwise leave me be . As to this silly , shallow place , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spa so far from where I want to be . I belong in my Lourdes hotel with the rest of my pilgrimage group , my friends , and I belong as close to the holy grotto as I can get . I 've taken a taxi back to Lourdes . If you wish , you can join me there . If not , I 'll see you in Chicago once I am cured . As much as you try me , Amanda , still I love you . KenAmanda felt not anger but a wave of frustration that made her feel weak and helpless . Ken , you fool , do n't be an ass , do n't commit suicide , she wanted to cry out . She had crumpled his note and turned to the bedroom when she spotted the two volumes of the Zola novel and the note that she had left on top of it last night . She walked toward the books , wondering if he had scanned them . Apparently he had , for she could see that he had scribbled something on the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found two words in his hand : " Fuck Zola . " She wanted to weep over Ken 's pious craziness , his blind idiocy , his expecting to be rescued from the clutches of death by some ghostly apparition from outer space . But she did not weep . Instead , she went into the bedroom to get dressed and follow him back to Lourdes . He needed someone more earthly to see that he survived . She was the one to do it . And she would do it , yet.  |p152It  was one minute after midnight in Lourdes , and the second day of The Reappearance Time had begun . At precisely two o'clock in the morning , the alarm of Natale Rinaldi 's travel clock on the stand beside her bed in the Hotel Gallia &; Londres had gone off shrilly . Immediately awakened , Natale had reached out , fumbled for it , and pressed her hand on it to still the persistent sound . She sat up fully aroused , coming out of a fuzzy dream-filled darkness into alert darkness , mind focusing and remembering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two in the morning and that she had gone to sleep without removing her dress , only kicking off her shoes which would be below the bed . Since her helper , Rosa , had not been able to guide her back to the grotto a second time the evening before , Natale had re/solved to go back alone when everyone else slept and she could enjoy the comfort of the shrine by herself . Swinging her feet off the bed , pushing them into her low-heeled shoes , she suffered a brief moment of panic . She wondered if she could possibly remember the direction , the count of the steps to each turning , once she departed her room and headed for the grotto alone . But the momentary void in her mind was instantly filled by the rows of numbers in order , the steps she must take to each turning , from her hotel room to the lobby to the Avenue Bernadette Soubirous to the ramp to the Rosary Basilica and the precious grotto itself . The numbers were there in her mind , as certain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she stood up , felt her way to the bathroom , doused her face with cold water , and combed her hair . She stepped into the corridor , locked the door , and placed the key in an inside pocket of the purse she had slung over her shoulder . She started to her right , seeking the elevator , and unerringly she reached it . She touched the rosary in her purse , thinking of her lone vigil at the grotto and the prayers she would offer to the invisible Virgin . When she heard the elevator arrive , she was ready to go on . Nothing could keep her from the One she loved and would be able to speak to alone . Slumped in a chair behind the reception desk , chin resting against the exposed mat of hair on his chest , Anatole was dozing . A sound of some kind , a familiar but unexpected noise , intruded upon his subconscious , awakening him . Opening his eyes , he could hear the elevator across the lobby descending . He listened as it rattled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reception desk clock told him it was five minutes after two o'clock in the morning . This was unheard of , someone using the elevator at this hour . Since arriving in Lourdes from Marseilles , and taking this boring job , Anatole had never seen anyone awake two hours after midnightin this dead-ass hotel . During the entire week of his employ/ment here , the lobby had been like a morgue between one o'clock in the morning and five . And now , at five minutes after two o'clock , someone was actually emerging from the elevator . Anatole came to his feet , bending over the counter as he squinted across the lobby . Of all people , the young woman , the great-looking girl , was emerging from the elevator . He recognized her at once . The absolutelydazzling blind girl . There she was in person . And all alone . Crazy , crazy . What the hell was she up to at this hour ? She seemed to know what she was up to , because she was making her way , with some certainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered that he had locked the hotel door , as he had been instructed to do , before taking his nap . The girl , the sexpot , would find it a secure barrier that would prevent her from going wherever she was headed . She deserved the courtesy of the hotel , he told himself , and he deserved a closer look . Immediately , he was moving , hastening along the reception counter and around it toward the door . She had reached the door when he called out , " Mademoi-selle . " She stopped in her tracks , startled , and turned her head . " I am Anatole , the reception clerk on the night shift , " hequickly explained . " You know it is after two in the morning ? " " Yes , I know , " she said without hesitation . " You want to go into the street at this hour ? " " I have an appointment , " she said . " Well , the front door is locked . We always keep it locked after everyone goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Please do , " she said . He was releasing the dead bolt . " If you expect to be back soon , I can leave it unlocked for you . " " I would appreciate that . " " Here , let me open the door , " Anatole said . He stepped in front of her , brushing against her , feeling thep155soft give of those fantastic young breasts against his arm . Easing the door back , he had a close look at her . A breathtaking pale face enlivened only by dark glasses . The pointed breasts . The soft short dress that clung to her hips and showed off the shapely legs . " Is the door open ? " she asked . " Yes . " He could hardly find his voice . " Can I help you in any way ? " " Thank you . I 'm all right . " She went unhesitatingly past him into the street . The second her foot touched the sidewalk , she turned to the right . He stepped out to watch her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anatole grinned . A gutsy little bitch . She 'd be something in bed . He kept his eyes on her , the wonderful legs , the undulating hips , and he was inflamed with desire . He 'd had many women in Marseilles , mostly whores paid for out of his meager earnings from rotten jobs that required manual labor , those and a few beat-up drunken dames who would do anything with anyone , but he had never made it with a young lady , with a high-flying lady , certainly not with someone who looked like this one did . He continued to keep his eyes on her receding figure in the patches of street lights that defied the darkness . In the distance , she had come to the corner , expertly stepped off the curb , crossed the street , and was going on past the cafe . To an appointment ? With whom ? And then he knew . The grotto . She was going to wait for the Virgin at the grotto . Dumb kid . How could she hope to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no Virgin there , she might want someone else , someone who could really keep her company . Turning back to the hotel , he could barely walk , the erection between his legs was so enormous . It was difficult to do in the flickering light of the candles far below , but Mikel Hurtado continued to crawl on hands and knees from the vegetation nearest the niche that held the statue of the Virgin Mary into the bushes and forest of trees.  |p156U|pon  awakening from his nap in the hotel a half hour ago , he had at first planned to carry his dynamite and detonator to the grotto and either hide the equipment or set it up . Dressing , he 'd had second thoughts . Yesterday , he had seen the grotto area in the evening , and it had been promising . Now he decided that he had better have another scouting exploration by night when there were no pilgrims around , but when there might be some guards on hand . His experiences in Spain had taught him it was essential to know the security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had gone down the stairs to the reception lobby , been let outside by the sleepy reception clerk , and gone along the empty street toward the domain . From the shadows at the bottom of the street ramp , Hurtado had been able to make a preliminary survey of the area near his destination . There was not a soul in sight around the Rosary Esplanade , nor on the double walks rising to the Upper Basilica . There appeared to be no one in the entrance to the grotto . As for the Esplanade des Processions , as the map called it , not a human could be seen on its entire length . Hurtado had started to move out of the shadows when , from nowhere it seemed , a figure appeared a short distance away  --  a man , an older blue-shirted night watchman wearing a shoulder holster . He was not exactly walking , really just shuffling along , coming up the Esplanade des Processions , probably from the gate at the far end , moving toward the Rosary Basilica . The watchman seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor left , as he advanced toward the churches . Reaching the steps before the Rosary Basilica , he seated himself to have a smoke . This had taken five minutes . He had finally dropped the cigarette butt on the pavement and ground it out with his shoe . Then he stood up and resumed his circuit of the domain . Eyeing the guard 's retreat , Hurtado consulted his wristwatch and decided to time him . Crouching , finally sitting out of sight on one side of the ramp from the street , Hurtado patiently waited . Twenty-five minutes had gone by before the guard could be seen advancing from the far side of the domain toward the basilicas . Over thirty minutes , closer to thirty-five , before he reached thep157entrance to the Rosary Basilica , once more resting and enjoying his ritual smoke . Five more minutes and the guard was again on patrol . Hurtado was satisfied with the timing . The guard came into this immediate area every thirty minutes , roughly on the hour and the half hour . Hurtado would wait until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the grotto . He would examine the shrubbery , bushes , trees beside and above the cave , and he would make sure to take his leave when he knew that the single guard was elsewhere in the domain . No problem . None whatsoever . When the guard was out of sight once more , Hurtado hurried down off the ramp , and silently as possible made his way around the corner of the church to the grotto . Again , there was not a human being in sight . The pilgrims slept in their beds through the night and early morning hours , and the grotto was abandoned . Hastening past the benches and the tiers of burning waxen candles , Hurtado did not give the grotto a second look . He went to the grassy slope beside it , trying to find the best way to climb up the steep incline . He did not want to take the regular path , the one that led to the top of the hill much farther on . Fortunately , there was the semblance of a worn path , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way toward the basilicas for a view of the extent of the domain below . Having come to a midpoint in the hill , parallel to the statue of the Virgin in the niche overlooking the grotto , Hurtado cut to his left , going crabwise toward the niche so that he could examine it close-up and consider the practicality of planting the dynamite and running the wiring off . Now that part of it was done , every aspect studied with care , and he was crawling upward again , into the more thickly wooded area , hunting for an obscure but perfect spot where he could set his detonator . In less than ten more minutes he had found the spot he wanted , a natural depression in the earth beside the broad base of a leafy oak tree . He marked it carefully in his mind . He would be ready tomorrow night . He brought his wristwatch with its luminous dial up to his face in the darkness . The time was right to leave . The guard wouldp158already be departing the immediate area of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On his feet once more , a trifle uneasy about the slippery footing , Hurtado slowly made his way downward until the tops of the burning candles came in view . Cautiously , before crawling down the rest of the way , he bent forward to see if the area in front of the grotto was still devoid of life . It was . It was n't ! His heart skipped a beat . Someone was there . Crouching at his high perch , holding onto the branch of a stunted tree , he tried to focus on the figure below . The figure , he could make out , was that of a young woman with dark hair , wearing black glasses , on her knees in a position of prayer . Her hands were clasped at her breast , and apparently she was silently praying before the grotto . There was something about her , the lack of movement , the stillness of her person , that indicated she was praying fervently , in a trancelike state . There was also something about her that Hurtadofound vaguely familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then it came to him  --  the dark hair and black glasses  --  the girl he had seen leaving the room next to his own at the hotel during the dinner hour last night . But to be here alone , at this ungodly hour , holding communion with the Virgin Mary really exceeded religious fanaticism . Also , her presence hampered his own plan to leave the area . The one thing he could not risk was being detected by anyone . He would have to remain in hiding until she had ceased petitioning the Virgin and departed . He continued to stare down at the immobile , entranced youngwoman , when suddenly she began to move , or rather her bodyinvoluntarily moved . She seemed to be swaying , leaning sideways , and then she toppled over , collapsed on the ground and lay unconscious . Obviously , succumbing to religious ecstasy , she had fainted . Now she lay crumpled on the ground , as inert as if she were dead . Instinctively , Hurtado wanted to scramble down the hill  --  orat least crawl down as swiftly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she became conscious , and he was revealed to her , she might beable to recognize and identify him later when suspects were soughtp159after the explosion . Caught between the desire to help and the fear of danger , Hurtado wished the security guard would return and spot her and revive her . But the watchman would not be returning for another twenty minutes , and he would be passing at some distance from the grotto area , and might overlook her inert figure . As the inner debate continued to worry Hurtado 's mind , something unexpected happened below . A second figure had appeared , on the run , a young man , going directly to the woman who had fainted before the grotto , and quickly kneeling beside her . He was making an effort to revive her , rubbing her limp wrists , patting her cheeks , pulling her up to a sitting position . At last she moved her head , shaking it , regaining consciousness . The man continued speaking to her , until she finally nodded . The man jumped to his feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cupped hand , and hastened back to her . He dabbed the water on her face with a handkerchief , and at once she was fully conscious and speaking . The man was helping her to her feet , and on her feet she seemed completely revived , yet confusedin some way . There was something odd about the way she reached out a hand , as if trying to feel her way , before the young man took a grip on her arm and led her from the grotto . It was during this that Hurtado realized the woman who had been praying so fervently at the grotto was probably blind . Trying to recall the moment he had set eyes on her at the hotel , Hurtado remembered that he had thought then that she was blind . He had completely forgotten it . Hurtado cursed beneath his breath . Her affliction meant thatshe would not have seen him if he had chosen to leave the areafifteen minutes earlier . Now he was uncomfortably stuck on thehillside near the grotto until the pair had gone , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coupleleaving . He tried to understand their relationship . She had undoubtedlytold her boyfriend that she was going to the grotto byherself , and had made an appointment with him to pick her up ata certain time , and he had come to get her just after she had fainted . The pair was gone now . But the guard could be seen at adistance on his patrol . Gradually , I urtado began to crawl down thep160hillside , to be ready to depart once the guard was out of the way . Near the bottom of the hill , Hurtado waited for the guard to have his smoke , and to start patrolling again . Seven or eight minutespassed , and Hurtado knew that the man would now be on his long amble around the domain . Hurtado carefully picked his way down the remainder of the hill and was relieved to be on level terra firma once more . Satisfied with his exploration , despite the delay , and pleased that everything was set for his final act , which would bring the Basque nationalists closer to success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towering Upper Basilica , and made for the street ramp and the Hotel Gallia &; Londres . Leading the grateful girl  --  he had learned her name was Natale and that she was Italian ( the best kind )  --  into the hotel lobby , ignoring the reception desk that he had left unattended , Anatole took her to the elevator that was waiting . She thanked him for the hundredth time , and insisted that she could make it up to her room by herself , but he was equally insistent that he wanted to escort her safely to her room . Going up in the elevator with her , Anatole was pleased with this lucky break . After she had left the hotel , he had intended to go back behind the desk and resume his nap . But all interest in sleep had vanished . His mind had been filled with images of the girl , those tits , that ass , undressing her , putting it into her , and his erection had not abated . At last , he had determined to seek her out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . He had convinced himself that she might want a warm body , a French lover , and that she might be impressed by his pursuit of her in the early hours of the morning . His intention had been to encourage her to invite him to her room or to invite her to his own room several blocks away from the Gallia &; Londres , for a few drinks and finally some real lovemaking . But finding her in a faint , being the big hero who had saved her , had been more than he had counted on . Now he had her gratefulness , and this would make her vulnerable . He knew that he need but ask her if he could stay the night , and he would have her immediate compliance.  |p161His  erection , briefly down , was growing once more . The elevator had stopped and they were on the second floor . " Let me see you to your room , " Anatole said . " What 's the number again ? " " You need n't bother . I know my way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , so let me get you to where you 're going . The number ? " " Room 205 , " she said . At the door of the room , she fished inside her purse , found her key , and put it in the lock . Aware of his continued presence , she said , " Thank you . " She unlocked the door , pushed it open , and went inside . He followed her , shutting the door behind him . " I thought I 'd see you safely inside , " he said . " You have , " she said . " I appreciate it . " " Are you all right ? " he asked . " I 'm fine . I 'd better get to sleep . Thank you again . " She put out her hand , and taking it , feeling the warm flesh of her hand , he was further aroused . He held her hand tightly . " Any time , " he said quietly . Abruptly , he pulled her to him , and pressed his rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tearing herself free . She was breathing fast . " What are you doing ? " she gasped . " Natale , I just wanted to kiss you . I  --  I 'd like to stay here tonight . " " You ca n't . I do n't want anything like that . Now please go . " " Come on , be a sport , Natale . You owe me . Do n't you want to do something . for me ? Sure you do . " " Not that , " she said , her voice rising . " I do n't owe you that . " She tried to contain herself . " You were nice to me , and I appreciate it , but now you 're not being so nice , and I do n't like it . I 'd suggest you not cause any trouble . Just be a gentleman and leave right now . " " All right , you win , " he said with mock contriteness . " But you are something special , so do n't blame me for trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Good-night , " she said with finality.  |p162Anatole  walked to the door , opened it noisily , and then banged it shut firmly , but remained in the bedroom . Soundlessly , he eased himself against the wall beside the closed door . She stood at the foot of her bed a few moments , sagging with relief . Then with a sigh , she felt her way along the bed to the closet , reached inside for her white nightgown and threw it on the bed . Anatole held his breath , wondering whether or not she was aware that he was still in the room . Then he was sure that she was not aware of him , was certain that he had left and that she was quite alone . Through narrowed eyes , he watched her . She had unbuttoned her dress and was pulling it off . She was wearing only a flimsy brassiere and tight string bikini briefs now . She turned away from him to hang her dress in the closet , and then stepped back to the bed , unhooking her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm breasts , with the great brown buttons of nipples , bobbed free , were facing him . She was reaching down to take off her panties . He caught his breath , his heart hammering with excitement , and the bulge at his crotch about to burst . Her bikini panties were coming down now , she was lifting one bare leg and then the other to step out of them , and the triangle of curly pubic hair was visible , and Anatole was out of control , unable to restrain himself a second longer . He zipped open the fly of his trousers , let his full erection burst out , and charged across the bedroom toward her . Mikel Hurtado , having left the elevator at the second floor , proceeded down the corridor toward room 206 . He had just passed the door of 205 , and was nearing his own door , when he heard a muffled scream , a scream from somewhere nearby . Startled , Hurtado halted in his tracks , listening intently . Another muffled drawn-out scream , high-pitched , a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his . Next door . The blind girl , the blind girl at the grotto . The beginning of another scream , abruptly choked off . Something was going on in there , something terribly wrong , and Hurtado did not bother to think , did not hesitate.  |p163Whirling  around , he rushed back to the door of 205 . He could clearly hear scuffling . He had grabbed at the doorknob , meaning to grip it and heave himself against the door to break it down , when the door , unlocked , flew open . Hurtado was inside the room . Instantly , he saw what was happening  --  the young girl naked on the bed , beating with her fists , as some animal , the palm of one hand clamped over her mouth , trousers half down , was trying to get on top of her and between her legs . Rape , savage attempted rape , was what Hurtado saw . Neither of them on the bed , in their struggle , was aware that someone else was in the room . Enraged by what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monster was trying to do to this helpless girl , Hurtado hurtled himself across the room to the bed . His hands clutched at the assailant 's shoulders , yanking him off the girl , and throwing him on the floor . Anatole , stunned by surprise , scrambled to his feet , hamperedby the trousers around his ankles , too amazed to lift his hands . Hurtado was on Anatole in a single motion , driving his right fist to the assailant 's jaw and smashing his left fist into the rapist 's abdomen . As Anatole groaned , doubling up , Hurtado unleashed more punches , battering the other 's head and face . Anatole began to crumple , and Hurtado kept landing his pile-driver punches . Anatole lay sprawled on the rug , half senseless , blood trickling from his mouth . Hurtado reached down , hooked his hands under the man 's arms and dragged him across the room and through the doorway into the hall . There , he dropped the dazed rapist . Briefly , Hurtado considered whether he should summon the police , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any police while he was in Lourdes . Instead , he kicked the rapist in the ribs , and in a low voice , so as not to awaken any guests , he warned him . " You get out of here , you fucking bastard , you get out of here and get out fast , or I 'll grind you into a meatball . " With effort , fright showing in his puffed eyes , Anatole climbed to his feet clutching his trousers , dribbling blood and nodding . Hep164turned , almost tripping , and staggered toward the staircase . Snatchingat the rail , he plunged down the stairs and out of sight . Hurtado grunted , and slowly went back into the girl 's bedroom . She was standing in a bathrobe , tying the sash , and groping for her dark glasses on the bed and putting them on . " Do n't worry , senorita , he 's gone , " Hurtado said in Spanish . She asked him something in Italian . He said in English , " I do n't understand Italian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Did you call the police ? " she asked , still trembling . " Not necessary , " Hurtado said . " He wo n't be back . I think he 's the fellow who works as a night receptionist downstairs . But I 'm sure he wo n't be back on the job or even stay in town . Are you okay ? " " Just scared , " she said . " Do n't blame you , " Hurtado said . " That 's an awful thing to have happen . How did it happen ? " She explained what had taken place , how she had gone down to the grotto by herself to pray , how the spiritual intensity had made her faint , how this person had come out of nowhere to revive her and bring her back to her room , how he 'd tricked her into believing that he had left the room when he had actually remained inside determined to rape her . " Thank God for you , " she concluded . " How you got in here in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot . " " It was sheer luck , " Hurtado said matter-of-factly . " I was out for a late night walk , was coming back to my room to go to sleep  --  I have the bedroom next to yours  --  when I heard you scream . I was going to break in to see what was happening , but the door had been left unlocked . " He paused . " Are you better now ? " " Much better , " she said with a wonderful smile . She came hesitantly around the bed toward him , stumbling once , righting herself , apologizing . " I  --  I 'm blind , you know . " " I know , " he said . She put out her hand . " I 'm Natale Rinaldi , from Rome . " He took her hand , shook it , released it . " I 'm Mikel Hurtado , " he said , " from  --  from Spain . "  | " Pleased to know you , " she said , " to put it mildly . Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a cure , an arthritic condition . " " Maybe both of us will be fortunate . " " I hope so , " he said . " Well , I do n't know what more to say except thank you again . Thank you a million times . " " If you really want to thank me , " he said sternly , " you can do so by promising never to let strangers see you to your room  --  and by keeping the door locked from the inside from now on . " She held up one hand . " I promise , " she said . " Now you get some sleep , Natale , and I will , too . " " Good-night , Mikel . " " Good-night , " he said , and he went through the doorway , closing the door . He listened for the lock to turn . The lock turned . He put his mouth close to the door , and said , " Good girl . " He heard her say , " I hope we run into each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured her . " Good-night . " At his door , unlocking it , he knew that he wanted to see her again . She was a delicious girl , so lovely , so sweet . He had never met a young woman quite like her , and he did want to see her again . Maybe he would . But he reminded himself he was here for business not romance . He must be all business from now on . No diversions . No failure . Euskadi was his life . The freedom of Euskadi came before anything . There was work to do . Sorry , Natale , he thought . There is only one love , the homeland I 've never had , and will have yet . Behind the steering wheel of her venerable Renault , Gisele Dupree , her blond hair tied in a neat ponytail , her features scrubbed and shiny and without makeup , drove unhurriedly through Tarbes and on the highway toward Lourdes . Sergei Tikhanovsat uneasily in the passenger seat beside her . His uneasiness came from Gisele 's disturbing habit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes on the road.  |p166But  then he realized that the deeper uneasiness he felt came from an unnerving happening that had occurred last night . With a shudder , he relived itLast night , asleep in the Dupree apartment , Tikhanov had awaken from a terrible nightmare in a cold sweat at four in the morning . Once fully awake , the nightmare had swum vividly before his eyes . He was running frantically from members of the KGB , desperately trying to find a place to hide . Sitting up in bed , turning on the lamp , he found that the horror of the nightmare had blurred slightly , and in the light he sought reason . What had brought on the scare ? General Kossoff and the KGB were n't chasing him . They were , in reality , honoring him . He was their star , soon to be the most shining star in the Soviet Union . But he had tried to hide from them in the nightmare  --  and immediatelyhe 'd understood that aspect of the nightmare and tried to interpret it . The hiding part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his total failure to sublimate his fear of being found out . By coming to Lourdes , he had put himself in a precarious situation , watching each step he made in his frontal move on faith and the hope for a cure . Yet , intent on this daring effort , he had neglected to protect his flank sufficiently . He had neglected to keep in touch with those in the Soviet Union who might need him most any minute and not be able to find him . What if they searched for him , and somehow managed to find him here ? A tremor went through Tikhanov . And then he realized he could prevent any suspicions by simplybeing in touch with his colleagues by phone before making himself visible to them once more in person . At the first opportunity he would contact the Soviet Embassy in Paris . He would call there , supposedly from Lisbon  --  no , he had called from Lisbon already  --  better to have returned to France to meet secretly with an arm of the Communist apparatus near Marseilles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . For now , he had better concentrate on what was before him , meaning his absolute anonymity in Lourdes.  |p167Worriedly  , he glanced at his talkative driver behind the wheel . Tikhanov was in no mood to engage in conversation with anyone , let alone this country girl . He wanted only to restore his health , and get to the seat of power that awaited him in the Kremlin as soon as possible . From a corner of his eye he saw a road sign . Twenty kilometers to Lourdes . Last night , in the taxi , the journey had taken a good half hour . At the rate the Dupree girl was going , it might take almost a full hour  --  and give her too much time for conversation . As if reading his mind , she turned her head and said , " No hurry . It 's just after eight and I do n't have my first tour until nine this morning . It is such a glorious day , not hot like yesterday . " She inhaled the fresh air through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay here forever . " Then she added enigmatically , " But I wo n't . " She looked at him . " Have you ever been to Lourdes before , Mr. Talley ? " At first he was unaware that he had been addressed , his mind drifting , and he did not respond . He had forgotten that he was Mr. Talley , but with a start he remembered his acquired name . Hastily he became more alert as he replied . " No , " he said , " no , I have never been anywhere near here . " " When did you get here ? " she inquired . " Oh , yes , it was yesterday when you were trying to find a room . " " Yes , yesterday late . " " From Paris ? " " I stopped over in Paris , yes , I have friends in Paris . " " And you came here for a cure you told me last night . Is yours a recent illness ? " He was uncertain of how to answer her . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several years . " " What made you finally decide to come here ? The news about the Virgin Mary reappearing ? " " I suppose that inspired me . It made me curious . I thought I would give it a try . " " Nothing to lose , " she said with a lilt . " Possibly everything to gain . " " I am hoping . "  | " You will remain the entire week ? " " If necessary . I hope to go back home no later than next Monday . My vacation will be nearly over . " " Home , " she said , eyes now on the road . " Where do you make your home in the States , Mr. Talley ? " He thought quickly . He had not anticipated personal questions and had not thought about this before . He tried to recall some remote places he had visited in the American East , places a person like Samuel Talley might have come from . He recalled a weekend trip he had made to a small town and resort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " My wife and I have a modest farm in Woodstock . " " I 've heard of it , " she said . " I 've heard it is picturesque . " " It is , it is . " Tikhanov was worrying . He wondered if she had detected an accent in his English . He had better cover the possibility . He went on casually , " Actually , my parents emigrated from Russia , separately , when my mother was fourteen and my father eighteen . They met in New York at a social event , and fell in love , and were married . My father had been a farmer , and he found this property in Vermont and bought it . I was born there . " Very casually , the next . " Growing up , I learned to speak Russian . It was natural . There was always Russian , as well as English , spoken around the house . " " I love languages , " Gisele said . " I speak four but Russian is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Tikhanov . " And you work the farm ? " inquired Gisele . This girl was too inquisitive and smart . It was no use lying . She might see that his soft hands were not those of a farmer . He forced a short laugh . " Me labor on the farm ? No , no . The truth is I 'm a professor . " He was feeling his way now . " Uh , a professor of the Russian language . I went to Columbia University , in fact majored in Russian and linguistics . After I got my doctorate , I became a member of the language department at Columbia . I teach Russian there . " " How do you manage to do it ? I mean , live in Woodstock and teach in New York ? "  |p169Tra|ps  , everywhere there were traps , but as a diplomat Tikhanovwas used to avoiding them . " Quite simple , " he said . " I keep a small apartment in Manhattan to use during the school year , but maintain our home in Woodstock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly at the Vermont house these days . She 's a Vermont native and we have a son at  --  at the University of SouthernCalifornia . He is studying theater arts . " In an effort to leave the fictitious past behind , he made a transition into the present . " My wife was a Catholic , so I became a Catholic , too . I am not too religious , as I mentioned last night . Still , enough so to come to Lourdes . " " But you work in New York City ? " she said . " Yes , of course . " " I love New York , absolutely love it . I ca n't wait to get back . " Tikhanov was worried again . " You 've been to New York ? " " I 've lived there , " she said cheerily . " I had the best time ever . There is so much to do in New York . I lived in New York for over a year . " Tikhanov tried not to be too interested . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a secretarial job at the United Nations . " " At the United Nations ? " " With the French delegation . I 'd met the French ambassador to the UN in Lourdes . He hired me to be one of his secretaries , and took me along when he moved to New York . It was a memorableexperience . I ca n't wait to go back . I made so many friends there . Some of my best friends are Americans . One of them was in the United States delegation to the UN . As a matter of fact , if I remember right , he was a graduate of Columbia University . Maybe he was a student of yours , for all I know . His name is Roy Zimborg . Does that ring a bell ? Did you ever have a Roy Zimborg in any of your classes ? " A big trap and danger . " I have had so many students it is difficult to remember names . Maybe he did not study Russian ? " " Probably not , " said Gisele @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was relieved . He could not wait to get away from this countryp170girl who had lived in New York and worked at the United Nations where he had appeared and spoken so often . Her inquisitiveness and persistent prying made him uncomfortable . Sooner or later she might catch him out in some error or inconsistency . He must rid himself of her . Presently , they were on the Avenue Bernadette Soubirous , and entering the parking lot of number 26 , which was connected to the Hotel Gallia &; Londres . " What 's this ? " Tikhanov asked . " The hotel where Edith Moore and her husband are staying , " said Gisele , getting out of the car . " I told you last night about Edith . She 's our miracle woman , had a miracle cure of cancer right here in Lourdes . You 'll find it encouraging to talk to her . You still want to , do n't you ? " " Certainly I do . " " Let me see if she 's in . " He watched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardened . He must separate himself from her and from her prying . If he continued to lodge in Tarbes with her family , he would have to commute to Lourdes with her every morning and evening , and answer a continual outpouring of questions , and inevitably be tripped up . He had to find a room of his own in town as soon as ' possible . That was the immediate priority . Gisele had returned , and was slipping into the driver 's seat . " Edith is at the Medical Bureau , checking in , but she 'll be back at the hotel for lunch . I left her a note , and told the girl at the desk to reserve two places at Mrs. Moore 's table for twelve o'clock noon . How 's that , Mr. Talley ? " " Perfect . " " What are you going to do with yourself until then ? " " You are the expert on Lourdes . What do you suggest ? " " Well , you 're here for your health , are n't you ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Most serious . " Gisele started the car . " Then here 's what I suggest . Go through all the routine that every ailing pilgrim goes through . First , go to the grotto and pray . "  | " I 'd like to . How long should I give it ? " She blinked at him . " Why , that 's up to you  --  five minutes , sixty minutes , whatever you feel . After that , walk over to the second trough , the one past the grotto , turn on one of the faucets and drink some of the curative water . Finally , next door you 'll find the bath houses . Go inside , shed your clothes , and take a dip . And think of the Virgin Mary when you do so . The baths have proved to be the most effective remedy yet . " " The water cures ? " " No , " said Gisele , shifting gears , " the water has nothing in it to cure . But your head does . Do n't forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now I 'll drop you off at the domain , Mr. Talley . " " My thanks , " said Tikhanov . " I 'll do everything you say , Miss Dupree . " Amanda Spenser had not been in a hurry to leave Eugenie-lesBainsand return to Lourdes . She had enjoyed a leisurely breakfast at the table on the balcony of her suite , thinking constantly of Ken , his illness , and finding it inconceivable that Ken , the fool , could have left this elegant paradise for that hovel in Lourdes . After breakfast she had dressed in pants , blouse , sandals , and taken a long stroll over the hotel 's lawn . The drive from beautiful Eugenie-les-Bains to miserable Lourdes had taken an hour and a half , but as she neared Lourdes , its monotony and accompanying depression had been alleviated by one valuable tidbit of information from her elderly balding driver . The driver had known a good deal about the Lourdes story and especially Bernadette herself . In passing , as they drove , he had mentioned Bernadette 's early illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Bernadette had been a frail youngster , but she had not known that the little girl had suffered so seriously from asthma . " It is a curious thing , " the driver had said , " that when Bernadettesought a cure for her severe asthma attacks , she did not go to the grotto . By the time Bernadette had seen the seventeenth apparition of the Virgin Mother , there had already been four mira/Iles cures at the grotto . But in truth , Bernadette did not herself believe in the curative powers of the grotto . Instead , when she was so sick , she went to Cauterets . " " Cauterets ? " Amanda had said . " What 's that ? " " A mere village . But also a fashionable spa in those days , not far from Lourdes . There was a healing spring , a thermal bath , that was supposed to be useful for an asthma cure . So Bernadette went there , not to the grotto , for her cure . Of course , she was not cured , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Amanda had mused . " She really did not believe in it ? " " Not for cures , no . She went to Cauterets instead . " " What 's Cauterets like today ? " " It is still there , less fashionable perhaps . It 's nearby . You drive up the valley into the mountains . I believe that there is even a shrine to commemorate Bernadette 's visit . " " How interesting , " Amanda had said . " I 'll have to remember that . " If Bernadette did not believe in a cure at the grotto , she would dare to ask Ken , why should he ? Now , in the reception lobby of the hotel , she wanted to find Ken . Perhaps he was still kneeling hypnotized before the grotto . Or perhaps he was in their awful room getting some rest . Maybe the plump receptionist at the desk , the one called Yvonne , would know . Amanda went to the desk . " I 'm Mrs. Clayton , " she said . " We had to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ken Clayton , came back this morning . I wonder if you 've seen him around ? " " Actually , I did , " said Yvonne . " He 's asked me to arrange for him to have lunch downstairs at Mrs. Edith Moore 's table . He should be in the dining room right now . You know where it is ? " " You said downstairs . I 'll find it . You can send my bags up to our room . " Amanda made for the staircase near the elevator , and hurriedlydescended to the entry to the dining area . She could see the main dining hall , plain , every table filled with nondescript pilgrims , with a second narrower dining hall beyond it , and alcoves and booths off that room for more private dining.  |p173A  maitre d ' materialized to inquire if she was a resident of the hotel , and Amanda gave her room number . " I 'm told my husband is lunching here now , and he 's expecting me . " " His name ? " " Mr. Kenneth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dining at Mrs. Moore 's table . Please follow me . " Amanda was brought to an oversized round table at the far side of the main dining hall . She spotted Ken immediately , and he wobbled to his feet to greet her . She went around to embrace and kiss him . " I 'm back , darling , " she whispered . " I 'm glad , " he said . " I hope you 'll join us for lunch ? " " I 'm famished . " Clayton signaled the maitre d ' for another chair , then took Amanda by the elbow and introduced her to the others at the table . " This is my wife , Amanda , " he announced . " Amanda , I want you to meet my friends . Right here we have Mrs. Edith Moore , from London . And this is Mr. Samuel Talley , from New York . And Miss Gisele Dupree , who works in Lourdes as a guide . " When her chair was in place , between Ken and Mr. Talley , Amanda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edith Moore was obviously the dominant , central personality , although everything about her from her flat , square countenance to her unadorned , inexpensive dress was commonplace . The Talley gentlemanwas more distinctive with his beady eyes , bulbous nose , and flowing mustache . The Gisele youngster resembled a French starlet on the make . Ken was speaking to Amanda . " You remember , I met Mrs. Moore on the train from Paris to Lourdes . The miracle woman  --  " " Oh , now , " Edith protested modestly . " I wanted to hear her whole story , " Ken continued , " and I invited myself to lunch with her . She was kind enough to have me . " " I 'm pleased to help anyone I can , " said Edith . " I hope I 'm not interrupting anything , " said Amanda , apologetically . " We 've hardly started yet , " said Ken . " We just ordered our lunch . Do you want to see the menu ? "  |p174Amanda  felt oppressed by the ordinary dining room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're having . " " We 're all having the same , " piped up Gisele . " For the main dish it 's grilled steak and potatoes today . Is that all right ? " " Suits me perfectly , " said Amanda , without enthusiasm . Gisele gave the order to the maitre d ' , and then directed herself to Edith Moore . " Anyway , Mrs. Moore , you were telling us that your malignant tumor of the iliac bone was discovered five years ago . " Edith gave a deprecating wave of one hand . " Well , if you 're sure you want to hear all that  --  " " Mrs. Moore , I am anxious to know how your cure came about , " said Tikhanov . " Yes , do tell us about it , " added Ken . Amanda kept her lips compressed . She wanted to tell them all that despite what they heard from Edith Moore about a cure at the grotto , Bernadette herself , the instigator of all this miracle nonsense , had put no faith in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a spa called Cauterets . But Amanda maintained her silence . She would not diminish the glory of this ordinary Englishwoman , and certainly she did not want to upset Ken , not right here in this odd group . " To make it brief , " Edith Moore was saying , " I had been forced to quit my job with a movie talent agency , and I could get around only with the use of a crutch , when Father Woodcourtthevery one on the train yesterday  --  suggested I join his next pilgrimage to Lourdes . Although I was a believer , I did not have much hope , nor was I given any great hope by Father Woodcourt . But I had reached a state where I was ready to try anything , you understand . " They all , except Amanda , bobbed their heads with full understanding . Ken , Amanda observed , most vigorously of all . Edith Moore halted her recital to allow the first course of the lunch to be served . The moment the plates were on the table , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edith 's monotonousvoice , no inflections whatsoever , and her colorless language.  |p175Nevertheless  , Amanda made a pretense of being extremely attentive . " The first visit to Lourdes produced no change in me , " Edith Moore recited . " Perhaps the visit was too brief , and I did not pray enough , even permitted doubts to enter my prayers . " Her gaze went around the table . " One must believe , " she said . She chewed her shrimp piously , and resumed with her mouth full . " The second visit , four years ago , I was determined to try harder . To stay longer and try harder . I prayed by the hour at the grotto . I drank water from the spring without stop . I immersed myself in the baths . On my final day , being assisted out of the bath , I found that I could stand and walk without aid . I went to the Medical Bureau and was examined . Over the next three years I returned to Lourdes , and realized I was cured . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By sixteen different doctors , " said Edith . " Even the iliac bone , which had degenerated , began to grow back to normal . There are X rays to prove it . " " A miracle , " said Ken with awe . " It has already been declared a miracle , " chirped Gisele enthusiastically . Edith Moore retreated behind a modesty that Amanda was sure she did not possess . " The miracle is not official yet , " said Edith . " I have one more examination with a famous specialist in Paris , Dr. Paul Kleinberg , who will be arriving here this week to confirm my  --  my full recovery . " " But that 's open and shut , " said Gisele , employing one of her favorite Americanisms . " Everyone in Lourdes knows you are the one , the latest , of a favored group closest to Saint Bernadette . " " Oh , I do n't know , " said Edith with a seraphic smile , but not actually denying it . " So it does happen , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone . " " If they have pure faith , " pronounced Edith as high priestess . Amanda , bending over her plate , felt sick to her stomach , with no desire to eat and with the single desire to get Ken away from the banal , stupid Englishwoman.  |p176Tikhanov  , his voice serious , said , " You attribute it all to the baths ? " " To everything here , to belief in the Immaculate Conception above all else , " said Edith . " But my cure happened after the bath on the last day of my second visit . " As Edith finished speaking , a rather large , florid gentleman  --  he reminded Amanda of pictures she had seen of Phineas T. Barnum  --  hadappeared behind Edith , stooping to kiss her on the cheek . " Reggie  --  " said Edith , pleased . " Everyone , this is Mr. Reggie Moore , my husband . " She proceeded to introduce Reggie to everyoneat the table , one by one . " Edith , " Reggie said , " I hate to interrupt your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's come up . " " But Reggie , " Edith complained , " I have n't had my dessert yet . " He was half lifting the miracle lady out of her chair . " I 'll treat you to some ices later . Please come along . " He saluted the others . " Glad to have made your acquaintance , everybody . Hope to see you again soon . " Pushing and then pulling , he was leading the reluctant Edith out of the room . " So it is the baths , " mumbled Tikhanov to no one in particular . He twisted toward Gisele . " You heard . She said it happened after the bath . " " Well , you 're on your way , " said Gisele . " You started your baths this morning . " " I am afraid I did not , " admitted Tikhanov . " I prayed by the grotto , but I did not go in the baths . " " Then go this afternoon , Mr. Talley . " " I shall . But first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He added quickly , " It is a pleasure to room with your parents , Gisele , but it is too far from here , too removed . I want to be close to the baths . I must find a hotel room in this city . I have tried , and I will try again . " Gisele eyed him shrewdly . " Is that all that 's bothering you , a hotel room in Lourdes ? " " I know it is impossible , but it is important . "  | " Maybe I can find you a hotel room , but it 'll cost you extra . Are you willing to pay extra ? " " I will pay anything reasonable . " " Say four hundred francs , for me to give to a reservations clerk . " " I will pay it . " " Let me see what I can do , " said Gisele , rising . " As a matter of fact , I 'm moving into town myself tonight . One of my girl friends is going to Cannes for the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have to be here for the overload of work . I 'll walk you to the baths now , and you can start in . You can meet me in front of the Information Bureau at five o'clock , and we can drive to my parents , pick up our things , and both move back to Lourdes tonight . If I can get you that hotel room . " " You will ? " " I think so , " said Gisele . She waved to Ken and Amanda . " Excuse us . You heard our heavy business . Pleased to have met you both . Good luck . " Amanda watched the trollop leave with the older man , and finally she turned to Ken , intent on bluntly telling him what the taxi driver had told her , that Bernadette had never believed in the grotto or that its waters could cure , and had gone to another village to seek her own cure . But facing Ken , Amanda saw his expression . Oh , Christ , she thought , he 's been lofted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . " Mrs. Moore is quite a lady , " he murmured . " She 's done a lot for me , she 's renewed me . " Je-sus , Amanda said under her breath . This was no time to shake him up with the truth . Besides , she told herself , she had better be sure of the taxi driver 's story about Cauterets . She had better go to Cauterets and find out for herself if what she had been told was actually a fact . Telling Ken about the incident could wait a day longer . " Ken , maybe you should go up to the room and rest for a while . " " I 'm going back to the grotto , " he said doggedly , starting to rise.  |p178Amanda  stared at him . That her man , sharp and brilliant attorney , athlete and handball player , marvelous lover , had been reduced to this puddle of piety was almost impossible to believe . But here it was , and she would somehow have to deal with it , with him , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinical psychologist . She sighed and stood up . " Very well . " " See you for dinner early . " She wondered what she would do in the desert of the afternoon . Maybe buy her future mother-in-law a souvenir , a plastic Virgin Mary . Going up in the elevator to the fifth floor of the hotel , Reggie Moore had been uncharacteristically quiet , but Edith knew that he had something on his mind . She knew that he was waiting for the privacy of their room before speaking to her . Once they were in their room , the door shut , Reggie all but pushed his wife into the straight chair at the table as he remained standing over her . Dutifully , Edith waited , letting him have the floor , prepared for him to speak what was on his mind . He spoke . " Edith , I had to get you off alone . I felt there was something I must discuss with you . " " Could n't it wait a few more minutes ? Those lovely people at lunch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's just it , " said Reggie emphatically , " the very thing I want to talk to you about . " " I do n't understand . What do you want to talk about , what very thing ? " " Your cure , " said Reggie . " The minute I came on you with all those people , I knew those freeloaders had cornered you to get some advice and inspiration . " " But they were n't freeloaders . That nice Mr. Talley said he would pay for my lunch . " Reggie showed his exasperation . " Edith , I did n't mean money . I meant they were freeloading from your  --  your mind . " " I do n't know what you mean . "  |p179She  was used to Reggie speaking to her as if she were a child , and she was ready to endure it now . " I mean everyone wants to use you , " Reggie answered . " Everyonewants to draw strength from you for themselves , selfishly in a way . My point is you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free . You should n't do it . " " But why not ? " she asked , utterly bewildered . " What 's wrong with it ? If the story of my cure gives people inspiration , gives them hope , why should n't I tell it to them ? I 'm an example to them , a fortunate one who was blessed with a miracle . They want to hear that it 's possible . Why should n't I tell them ? " Reggie was momentarily without an easy or logical answer . " Well , because  --  " he said hesitantly , " because  --  well , I 'd feel betterabout what you 're doing once the miracle is officially con-firmed . " " Oh , that , " she said , dismissing it , " if that 's all you 're worried about , you need n't bother . My cure has been confirmed , really . It 'll be officially confirmed  --  a technicality , as we both know  --  the day after tomorrow . I spent the morning with Dr. Berryer at the MedicalBureau . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best men in the field  --  one with much experience in sarcoma cases  --  a Dr. Paul Kleinberg in Paris , who is arriving tomorrow to review the papers on my case and have the final look at me . " " Tomorrow ? " " Absolutely . Dr. Berryer will phone me after Dr. Kleinberg arrives , and let me know when to see him on Wednesday . Dr. Kleinberg will then confirm the miracle and it will be announced . " " Well , in that case , " said Reggie , displaying his relief , " that 's different , and I should n't be worrying . Since that 's happening , I guess it 's all right for you to talk about your cure . " " Of course it is , Reggie . I 'm glad you agree . " " Yes , I 'm sure it 's all right , " said Reggie smoothly , " and , as you say , it does give so many suffering people the belief that they can be cured , too . Yes , I 'll go along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , just like the first apostles , spreading the word of miracles . " He paused , his face lighting up . " In fact , we should celebrate again . Jamet has finished remodeling the newp180restaurant  --  it 's a grand place now  --  and he and I are having our reopening tonight  --  we 're plastering the town with handbills announcingthe great event  --  " " How wonderful ! " "  --  and I want you right there beside me to greet the guests . There should be a huge turnout . We 'll have a special table and we 've invited eight or ten important people , not just from Lourdes , but pilgrims from everywhere , to join us . I know they 'll all be thrilled to meet you . And you can answer their questions . They 'll be inspired to hear every detail of your story . What do you say , old girl ? " " Of course I want to be there , and tell them whatever they want to know . I do n't mind if you 're sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Reggie with a half smile . He bent over and kissed Edith 's cheek . " You 're my little lady , my miracle lady . We 're going to go far together . "  |p181It  was early afternoon , and Mikel Hurtado was sound asleep in his room on the second floor of the Hotel Gallia &; Londres , and he might have slept much later into the afternoon if the insistent ringing of the telephone on his bedstand had not awakened him . It rang and rang without stop , until Hurtado finally shook himself awake , realized it was the telephone , and reached for the receiver , almost knocking the phone over as he brought the receiverto him . " Yeah ? " " Mikel Hurtado , please . " It was a faintly familiar female voice asking for him in English . " Mikel , is that you ? " " It 's Mikel . Who is this ? " The events of the early morning hours came back to him , the attempted rape next door , his own role in heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind girl next door , her name was Natale , and at first he thought that it was this Natale phoning to thank him again . But the voice on the other end of the line was deeper and now speaking to him rapidly in Basque . " I 've been ringing a long time , " she was saying , " and I was just about to give up , when you answered . Mikel , do n't you know who this is ? This is Julia . I 'm calling from San Sebastian . " Julia Valdez , his colleague in the Basque underground , calling long distance . He was immediately annoyed , becoming angry . " We agreed you were not supposed to call me in Lourdes , " he snapped out . " I want no calls here . Are you crazy ? " " I had to call , " Julia implored . " It is important . " Resigned , he said , " What can be so important ? " " Your life , " said Julia , lowering her voice . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told himself , being so young and immature . So he remained calm . " My life ? " he said . " What are you talking about ? " " It 's my fault , in a way , " Julia was saying . " I 'd better explain . Augustin came looking for you this morning . " Augustin Lopez , as leader of the ETA , rarely had time to meet with him unless it involved some pending action . Hurtado wondered if the assassination of Minister Bueno had been revived . He was instantly alert . " Do you know what he wanted ? " " He said that he must see you . Luis Bueno has set a conference on our autonomy to begin in Madrid right after the reappearance of the Virgin . The minister is so confident the reappearance will occur that he has set a definite date for talks . Augustin wanted to inform you , and to consult with you about a strategy and agenda for the talks . " " The talks , " Hurtado said with contempt . " Augustin really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's becoming senile . Julia , that 's what you called me about ? " " Mikel , no , I am calling about what followed . Augustin kept insisting that he must see you . I could n't tell him where you were , of course . So I tried to stall . But he 's pretty smart , the old man is ,  |p183and  he started becoming suspicious . He pressed me to tell where you were , when you 'd be back in the apartment . I told him soon , promised him you 'd be back in a few days . Mikel , he kept pushing me . Back from where ? ' he kept saying . Where has he gone ? ' He knew that I was hiding something . He pressed me and pressed me , and was beginning to lose his temper  --  and you know his temper , Mikel  --  and he started saying I was keeping something from him , and he demanded to know what , and would force an answer out of me unless I was honest with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you told him the truth , " Mikel interrupted bitterly . " You told him where I was . You told him I went to Lourdes . " " Mikel , I had no choice but to be truthful , " she begged . " He 'd see through any lie . He always does . I was forced to say you 'd gone to Lourdes to  --  to see what was going on . Augustin saw through that at once . He would n't let me get away with it . You mean our Mikel has suddenly got religion , hopes for a chance to see the Virgin Mary ? ' He was shouting at me . Then he said , Bullshit ! He 's gone there to cause some trouble , to do something , anything , to keep me from negotiating with Bueno , to force me to approve of direct action , of terrorism . ' Augustin kept saying that , words like that , trying to make me confess that I knew what you were up to . When I refused to confess , he lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " That does n't sound like him . " " I know . But he was really out of control . He kept on shouting . He said , If Mikel has gone crazy , thinks he can get anywhere with an act of violence in Lourdes , he 's got to know that all he 'll blow up is our chance for a peaceful settlement with Spain . He is going to try something violent , is n't he ? ' Mikel , he was hurting me , painfully . I had to tell him the truth . " Hurtado 's own anger rose . " You told him the truth ? " " I had no choice . Then Augustin said , Do you know where to reach him ? ' I said I did , but I 'd never tell . I told him he could kill me first . He said , ' The minute I leave , you reach him . You order him to return to San Sebastian immediately . That is a strict order . If he attempts to defy it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . ' Mikel , those were his very words . Please listen to them . Augustin knows best . " Hurtado was furious . " Fuck Augustin . Fuck you , too , for being so stupid as to tell him what you did . " " Mikel , " she pleaded on the phone , " be reasonable . He 's smarter than I am . He knew without my telling him . He 's just too smart . " He 's also your father figure , your authority figure , and you want him to love you , Mikel thought , and he gave himself seconds to simmer down and be reasonable . " All right , Julia , I should n't blame you . I know you were on the spot . " " I was , Mikel , I was . I 'm glad you understand . " " But I 'm not forgiving him , not forgiving his sudden softness , " Hurtado went on implacably . " He wants my answer today ? You can give him my answer today , in fact right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to San Sebastian , tell him I am not leaving Lourdes until I 've done what I 've come here to do . Got it ? " There was silence on the other end . Julia 's voice finally filled the void . Her tone was a tremble . " Mikel , you  --  you 're not actually going to  --  to do what  --  what you told me you were going to do ? " " You 're damn right I 'm going to do it . " " Mikel  --  " " Stay out of this , Julia . I 'm going ahead . No one is going to get in my way . " Julia 's response was hushed . " Mikel , if you could have seen him , you 'd know . He wo n't let you . He will stop you . He 'll say it is for the good of the cause . But he wo n't let you go ahead . He will stop you . " Hurtado gave an angry laugh . " Let him try . " With that , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his legs still under the blanket , trying to think . He did not like what was going on , but what the whole matter came down to , Mikel felt convinced , was that Augustinwould not move to undermine a fellow fighter in the movement . In the end , Augustin would be reasonable himself and loyal . It had been an empty threat to display authority . Augustin Lopez would make no real effort to stop him.  |p185Feeling  better , Hurtado looked out the window into the sunny afternoon . The grotto would be teeming with visitors right now . He would wait a few hours , wait until the crowd in the domain thinned out before dinner . Then he would carry his goodies down to the grotto , and there , at the first opportune moment , secrete them in the small forest above . After that , he would walk back to the hotel for a hearty dinner , and after dinner bide his time until midnight , maybe an hour or so after midnight , to return to the grotto to do the job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spurred by the incentive of a 400-franc bonus from Sergei Tikhanovif she could find him a hotel room ( and certain that she could find him a room ) , Gisele Dupree decided to drive with her affluent client to Tarbes right away to collect and move their belongings to Lourdes . There was still time , Gisele could see , better than two hours , before she was scheduled to guide a Nantes pilgrimage group to the grotto . Tikhanov readily agreed with her new plan . On this trip she drove the red Renault fast , at breakneck speed , and they arrived at her parents ' apartment in Tarbes in almost no time at all . Inside , she was able to pack her two suitcases swiftly . Tikhanov , who had unpacked very little the night before , was in the living room and ready with his single bag when she came out with her suitcases and a note to leave for her parents . Again , with minimal traffic on the highway to slow them , Gisele covered the distance between Tarbes and Lourdes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Once inside Lourdes , and having swung into the Rue de la Grotte , heading for their destination near the foot of the Chateau Fort , she broke her concentrated silence . " We 're just about there , " she said to Tikhanov . " I 'm taking you to the Hotel de la Grotte . Very elegant and merely ten minutes from the domain and the sanctuaries . " " Are you sure you can find me a room there ? " Tikhanov asked worriedly . " Do not be concerned , Mr. Talley . I have the best connec-tions . " Indeed , she did have a good connection at the Hotel de lap186Grotte . She had done favors for the main receptionist , Gaston , and , in turn , he had done favors for her . They had an understanding about a spare room that was usually available for a guest prepared to pay for it with a bonus . The huge white stucco five-story hotel , with the lettering HOTEL DE LA GROTTE strung across the top of its roof , loomed before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrought-iron gates , entered the blacktop forecourt that curved past the blue awning and glass doors of the front entrance , and bore right into the half-filled guest parking lot . " You wait here , " said Gisele , leaving the car . " I have to see my friend and find out about the room . " " I 'll be here , " said Tikhanov . " Where else would I be ? " Gisele strode rapidly back to the hotel , and once inside turned right to the reception and key desk . It was unattended , but then she saw her friend Gaston coming from the blue lounge beyond the main lobby and returning to his station . " Gaston ! " she called out , and the diminutive figure in the black suit and bow tie halted , searched off and recognized her . His face broke into a show of pleasure , as he minced toward her . They hugged , kissed each other 's cheeks , and parted for business . " Gisele , my child , it has been a while . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaston , I need a room . Do you have one ? " " It depends , " Gaston said warily . " This is a very , very busy season , you know . " " I have an important American client out in the car , " said Gisele , " a New York professor . He offers a four hundred  --  franc bonus for a spare room . Half for you , and half for me . " " I will check . I think there is a space available on the third floor . " Pleased , Gisele clapped her hands , signaled a bellboy to follow her , and dashed out to the parking lot . A few minutes later she came back with Tikhanov in tow , grandly introduced him with a short biographical sketch to Gaston , whispered to her client that it was the moment to deliver the bonus . Waiting while Tikhanov peeled off the 400 franc notes , she slippedp187200 francs to Gaston , and held on to the rest . Once Tikhanov had been safely registered , he was off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bellboy . " See you around , Mr. Talley , " she called after Tikhanov . " Thank you , Mademoiselle Dupree , " he answered . Once more in her car , noting that she still had time for her next two stops before taking on her afternoon tour , Gisele drove to her first stop , parking on the Avenue du Paradis , around the corner from the Cafe Jeanne d'Arc . Walking to the cafe , she peered inside and made out her friend Dominique clearing a table near the bar . Gisele went inside . " Dominique , is the apartment free ? I 'd like to move my things in . " " All free and ready for you , " said Dominique , plucking a key from her pocket and handing it to Gisele . " You can give it back to me when I return late Sunday night . " Dominique had been invited by a wealthy patron , a Lebanese Christian , to accompany him on a five-day vacation to Cannes . " I 'll be waiting for you , " promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an espresso and a pastry ? I see there 's a table outside . " Buying a copy of Le Figaro , Gisele went to the outdoor table , sat down in the yellow wicker chair as Dominique came up with the coffee . Sipping her espresso , Gisele placed the Paris newspaper before her . The front page was dominated by the photographic portraits of three Russians . The heading above them posed the question : WITH THE SOVIET PREMIER SERIOUSLY ILL , WHO WILL BE HIS SUCCESSOR ? Gisele 's attention went to the lead front page story . Based on a brief report from TASS , the Soviet news agency , Premier Skryabin , head of the Soviet Union , was in a Moscow hospital . His condition was regarded as serious . Although the TASS announcementmade no mention of an actual successor , there was speculation that the Politburo was considering three veteran Russian politicians for the high post . Gisele 's attention shifted to the photographs of the likeliest candidates for the premiership . Two of the pictures and names meant nothing to her . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for she recognized his name and vaguely his face . He wasp188identified as Sergei Tikhanov , the longtime foreign minister of the Soviet Union . Gisele remembered , during her year at the United Nations , seeing the great Tikhanov speaking to the UN members from the podium . His stolid presence and self-assurance had made a lasting impression , and briefly , afterward , she had gone with her employer and lover , Ambassador Charles Sarrat , to a cocktail receptionfor Tikhanov . Staying close to Sarrat , as he had gone to shake the foreign minister 's hand , she had actually seen Tikhanov from three feet away , but now remembered only his stony profile , his fat nose , and beneath it on his upper lip an oversized brown wart . And now , this man she might once have reached out and touched , could be the next ruler of the Soviet Union . Immediately , Gisele 's mind was off once more on another of its countless journeys to her stay at the United Nations , and she knew more than ever that New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money for translator 's school and to get another job at the UN as soon as she had her diploma . But she realized that it could not be very soon , at least not at the rate she was saving . She hoped for tips and bonuses at the end of her guided tours , but with the exception of an occasional Samuel Talley , the pilgrims and tourists who came to Lourdes were either poor or ungenerous . It was going to be difficult , finding that extra money she needed , but she was determined . She glanced at her watch . Barely time enough for her one more stop , to unload her suitcases at Dominique 's apartment and hasten to meet up with her Nantes Pilgrimage and one more deadeningtour of this tiresome city . She finished her espresso , paid her bill , stuffed the newspaper into her purse , and headed for her car and Dominique 's apartment . At last alone in the privacy of his own hotel room on the third floor of the Hotel de la Grotte , Sergei Tikhanov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made straight for the telephone . Taking up the white-and-red telephone book on the shelf beneath the phone , he turned to the blue pages that offered information on the PTT system . Scanning the French text , he was pleased to learn that calls inside France from Lourdes could be made automatic/He ,  |p189meaning  he could direct-dial Paris without worry that the origin of his call would be suspect or possible to trace . Immediately , he dialed the Soviet Embassy in Paris , gave his code name , and was put straight through to the Soviet ambassador . After an exchange of amenities , Tikhanov said that he was phoning from Marseilles and was not on a safe phone and therefore would be brief and imprecise . He was just checking in , before returning to a vital meeting with their country 's friends outside Marseilles . He was calling to make only two inquiries : Had the general at home tried to reach him ? And how was the premier ? Tikhanov was relieved to hear that General Kossoff of the KGB had not tried to reach him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The premier has not called either . But I hear he is in his usual good health . " For a moment , Tikhanov was puzzled , then remembered the open phone line . " Ah yes , of course . " Tikhanov thanked the ambassador , and was about to hang up , when the ambassador suddenly asked , " If the general should want to talk to you , can I tell him where you 're staying ? " Tikhanov had been ready for that . " You 'll tell him I had to leave the city to meet with our friends in a place where I can not be reached . You can tell the general I 'll be done with our business by the weekend , and I 'll be in touch with him directly on Monday or Tuesday . " With that , the crucial call was finished , and his disappearance protected , and Tikhanov felt better than he had at any time since his arrival in Lourdes . Slowly unpacking , he had time now to take in the single roomhe had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was used to luxurious hotel apartment suites . His briefconfinement with the lowly Duprees in Tarbes had been depressing , and he was glad to be away . But better than that , even moreof a relief than escaping them , was his freedom from the inquisitivepresence of that little hustler , Gisele , who had once worked at the United Nations and who might have eventually put him in jeopardy . To be shed of her , to be on his own , was the ultimate relief . While waiting for the order he had placed with room service  --  he had not eaten enough at lunch in his concentration on Mrs. Moore  --  he began to pile his neatly folded shirts , undershirts , socks , pajamas into the drawers of the antique fruitwood chest on the wall across from the twin beds . Despite the crucifix hung on the ' ' I wall between the beds , despite the pseudo-antique white Directoire chairs with their plastic upholstery , the room was acceptable . The marigold yellow drapes , and the French doors opening on a tiny balcony with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refreshing . Tikhanov finished his unpacking just as the swarthy waiter arrived with his order . After the waiter had left , Tikhanov pulled a chair up to the table on which the tray rested next to the television set , unfolded the copy of Le Figaro he had requested , and drank his double vodka on the rocks . The first thing he saw on the front page was the picture of himself , as a candidate for the premiership of the Soviet Union , and he stared at it with mixed emotions . His immediate sensations were of surprise and pleasure , surprise that TASS had so quickly announced that Skryabin was ill beyond recovery and would have to be replaced , and pleasure in the official word made public from Moscow that he , Sergei Tikhanov , was one of the choices for his nation 's highest post . It did not bother him that there were two other candidates mentioned . They were party hacks , and their mentionwas merely a subterfuge until the real announcement could be made , and when it was made  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be but one name for premier and it would be his own . On the other hand , and this was the mixed part of his emotions , it was not wise to have his picture on the front page of a leading French newspaper while he was still lingering in France , and of all places , in Lourdes . But automatically patting his shaggy false mustache , he felt reassured that he would not be recognized . His disguise had not been penetrated and could not be . That , as well as his unlikely presence at a Catholic shrine , gave him sufficient protection . Draining his glass of vodka , he wolfed down his salad and omelette au jambon as he read every word of the story released from Moscow . When he had finished both his meal and the story , hisp191complacency was disturbed by a reminder of one thing . He was an ailing man , and his glory would not be long-lived unless he could be cured in this spot so publicized for its inexplicable cures . Actually , he had come here with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given him an iota of hope , a trickle of faith , had been his luncheon encounter with the plain Englishwoman , Edith Moore , who had been cured of cancer by a visit here . Cured by a visit to the baths . It defied Tikhanov 's orderly sense of logic , such a cure , yet it had taken place and been attested to by the most respected members of the medical profession . He had personally met the recipient of such a magical cure . This was no time for questioning or demandinglogic . This was a time for believing . He rose from the table . The day was short , and so was his time on earth , unless he gave himself over to magic . So it was off to the baths . Taking the elevator downstairs , Tikhanov headed for the receptionand key desk . The Dupree girl 's friend , the receptionist Gaston , was there engaged in a conversation with another gentleman . Tikhanov prepared to inquire of Gaston how one reached the bathing area from the hotel . Before Tikhanov could speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talley , there is someone here you must meet ... Professor , this is Dr. Berryer , the gentleman in charge of the renowned Lourdes Medical Bureau . " Briefly , Tikhanov considered the one whose hand he was shaking . Dr. Berryer had deep lines in his forehead , eyes like poached eggs , a faintly aloof and clinical air , and appeared solidly built in his old-fashioned suit . " Pleased to make your acquaintance , " said Tikhanov . " The pleasure is mine , " said Dr. Berryer . " Gaston had mentionedyour arrival . We are always flattered to have academics here . I hope you 've found Lourdes to your liking . " " I have n't had time to find out yet , " said Tikhanov , " but with the town 's credentials , I 'm sure I 'll like it very much . " He turned to Gaston . " In fact , I thought I would try the baths today . I 'm not sure how to get there . " " You need only follow Dr. Berryer , " Gaston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm going in that directionright now , to the Medical Bureau . It is not far from the bathhouses . You can come along with me , just a short walk . " " Delighted , " said Tikhanov . They emerged from the hotel , and started west on the Rue de la Grotte . " This is kind of you , Father Berryer , " said Tikhanov . Dr. Berryer offered a glacial smile . " I am not a priest . I am a layman , a physician , and a Catholic . " " Forgive me . The Medical Bureau of course . It becomes con-fusing . " " There may be more doctors in Lourdes than priests , " said Dr. Berryer . " You have come here for your health , Professor Talley ? " " To see what can be done for my muscular dystrophy . " " Umm . It is possible . Who knows ? You will be in the hands of the Virgin . There have been miraculous cures in many similar cases , as you know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edith Moore . I was extremely impressed . " Dr. Berryer nodded . " Mrs. Moore , our latest , an inexplicable cure certified by medical science . I had examined her myself . A remarkable recovery , instantaneous and complete . " " She informed me that it occurred after she had bathed in the spring water , " said Tikhanov . " Therefore it encourages me to undertakethe baths today . " " The baths , " murmured Dr. Berryer . " You know about them ? " " I am ashamed to say , not a thing , except that since the time of Bernadette they have cured . " " True , they have , " said Dr. Berryer . " You may be interested in the background , how the baths came about , before you undertakethem . " " I am most interested . " As they continued to walk past the souvenir shops , Dr. Berryer launched into a subject that clearly fascinated him . " The baths had their beginning on February 25 , 1858 , when Bernadette went to the grotto and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasp193a crowd of four hundred onlookers on hand to observe her . The Virgin Mary spoke to her . Bernadette recalled it after . ' The Lady said to me , " Go and drink at the spring and wash yourself in it . " Not seeing any spring , I was going to drink from the Gave . She told me it was not there . She pointed with Her finger to the spring . I went there but saw merely a little dirty water . I put my hand in it but could not get hold of any . I scratched and the water came , but muddy . Three times I threw it away ; the fourth time I was able to drink some . ' Actually , Bernadette not only drank some of the muddy water , but washed her face with it . Then , as she later claimed she was instructed , she attempted to eat a handful of weeds . She tried to do this but was forced to spit them out and vomit . Many spectators were revolted by her behavior , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insane . But by the next day the trickle of muddy water had miraculously become clear water and was coming out through a hole that was enlarging . The spring grew until it was a pool , and soon many visitors were drinking from it and washing in it , and there were numerous cures that resulted . Gradually , a series of concealed pipes were built to bring the spring water up to spigots and faucets from which pilgrims might drink and to bathhouses where the ailing might be immersed in the water . " " But this water is known to cure ? " Tikhanov inquired , wanting to be certain . " No doubt about that , " Dr. Berryer assured him . " But here we are together , a man of science and a learned scholar , so I can not be anything but candid with you . And in candor I must tell you that chemically there is no medicinal or curative element in the spring water , none at all . " " None ? " " None . In April of 1858 , Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was asked to analyze the water . He did so and reported , ' The result of this analysis is that the water from the grotto of Lourdes has a composition that may be considered as a drinking water similar to most of those found in the mountains where the soil is rich in calcium . The water contains no active substance giving it marked therapeutic properties . It can he drunkp194without inconvenience . ' In short , the spring water was ordinary drinking water . Through the years a concern grew that the water might actually be harmful . In 1934 , my predecessors sent samples of the bath water to laboratories in Anvers and Tarbes , and to a laboratory in Belgium . Each analysis report was in agreement with the other . The Lourdes bath waters were extremely polluted  --  yet utterly harmless , for the billions of bacilli found in the water were inert . As the aged president of the Hospitaliers , Count de Beauchamp , used to say , I have drunk a whole hospital full of microbes , but I have never yet been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Tikhanov , " is that the drinkingand bath water at the grotto in itself contains no properties that are helpful . " " Exactly . " " Then what makes the waters curative ? " Dr. Berryer shrugged . " What can I say ? As a physician I can say it is the psychological element that cures . As a Catholic I can say it is an inexplicable spiritual cure fostered by the blessed Virgin . I know this one fact . The waters have cured , do cure , will continue to cure . " " So you would recommend the baths . " " What do you have to lose with your illness ? You did speak to Mrs. Moore . Surely that is enough . " Tikhanov smiled apologetically . " It is encouraging . " As they strode along , Tikhanov saw that after crossing the bridge they were no longer on the Rue de la Grotte but on the Avenue Bernadette Soubirous , and ahead the spire of the Upper Basilica was in view . " Let me prepare you for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty thousand gallons of the grotto spring water is piped daily to the taps from which pilgrims drink and to the men 's and women 's bathhouses . Water is also held and released from two storage tanks . Now , you may have heard some skepticism about the cleanliness of the bath water  --  " " I have heard no such thing , " said Tikhanov hastily . " No matter . The fact is that well over a hundred pilgrims bathe in the same water before it is changed at noon . There is oftenp195worry that the residue of the ailing may infect the healthy who bathe , and that this might result in a typhoid or cholera epidemic . But have no fear . There has never been an epidemic , and , to my knowledge , no one has ever been infected from water used by previous bathers . However , there have been cures , cures that I , myself , have verified . Invalids have gone into the baths for their one-minute immersions and climbed out under their own power perfectly healthy . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Me ? Not ever , not once . But thank God I 've had no need for a cure . I remain healthy . " As they meandered down the ramp , Dr. Berryer remembered something . " But other physicians have lotionedthemselves , as some call it , in the bath water . I remember particularly a predecessor of mine in the Medical Bureau , Dr. Jean-Louis Armand-Laroche . He used the baths whenever he was in Lourdes , although he did not find them particularly hygienic . Someone asked him why then did he use the baths . Dr. ArmandLarochereplied , I do it as a believer . I do it in humility , in the spirit of penance and as a spiritual exercise . ' " Dr. Berryer cast Tikhanov a sidelong glance . " But you have more in mind . " " I hope to be cured . " Dr. Berryer said , " Then try the baths . " They had crossed the Rosary Esplanade . Dr. Berryer gestured off to the left at the archway . " Past the grotto , past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I must go back to the Medical Bureau , so I will leave you here . I leave you in the best of hands . Remain optimistic . Good luck . " Tikhanov watched Dr. Berryer go , at last turned in the direction of the grotto , girding himself for the strange ordeal ahead . The baths proved easy to find . There was a low , long , austere building with a marble front , entrances on one side for males , and entrances on the other side for females . There were some portable railings about for crowd containment , and four rows of metal chairs at each of the entrances . Nearby , there was also a black-robed , bearded priest of indeterminate nationality standing in front of a group of pilgrims and saying the rosary with them . There was a short queue at the nearest entrance to the men'sp196bathhouse , and Tikhanov fell into line , his heartbeat quickening with the knowledge that , for his grave illness , he was at the spiritual clinic of last resort . The line of men was shuffling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathhouse , stood in a corridor , off which were a series of blue and white curtains . A cheerful volunteer , a brancardier , spoke to them in an Irish accent . He explained that there were 2,000 men  --  and 5,000 pilgrims on the women 's side  --  who came through here every day , so no time could be lost . Behind the curtains , he said , were the dressing rooms , and these led to the baths . Tikhanov was directed to the first dressing room . He shoved aside the damp curtain and went into the cubbyhole . Three men , in their shorts , were seated on a bench awaiting their turns . A French brancardier , on post at the exit curtain , called over to Tikhanov , " You are American or no ? " " American , " Tikhanov answered . The brancardier switched to English . " You will disrobe , like the others . Leave on only your undershorts . " Nervously , Tikhanov began to take off his shoes and socks , shirt and trousers , until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his clothes , started for the bench , when he saw that it was empty . He was about to sit down , but the volunteer beckoned for him to come across the dressing room . There , the volunteer wrapped a soggy blue towel securely around his waist , then ordered him to remove his shorts underneath . " You will have them back with your clothes when you leave the bath . When you finish with the bath , do not wipe yourself with this towel . You do not dry yourself . You leave the water on your body , and put your clothes on again over it . You will dry soon enough in the sun . Now , the bath . " He took Tikhanov by the elbow and sent him past the curtain to the bath itself . Tikhanov teetered on the edge of a long rectangular sunken stone tub , filled with water that he was positive was foul . Two husky brancardiers wearing rubber boots and sporting blue aprons over their shirts and trousers , took his arms from both sides and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of them signaled him to wade to the far end of the tub . Tikhanov did as he was told . Wading to the opposite end , Tikhanov found himself confrontinga Madonna on the wall and a large crucifix bound in rosary beads . A robust attendant leaned over and asked him what languagehe spoke , then handed him an enameled metal card with lettering . " A prayer for you to say in English , and after that make your silent request to God . " Tikhanov mouthed the prayer to himself , and , handing back the card , tried to think of a request to make of the Highest Power . But he could only think of the brackish water and the billions of bacilli populating the water . The attendants ' outstretched hands grasped Tikhanov 's hands while he was reassuringly told to sit down in the tub . Tikhanov lowered himself into the water , which covered his white torso up to his abdomen . One attendant ordered Tikhanov to ease back in the water , to lay back , immersing himself up to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the water rising to his neck , and then suddenly he slipped , and his entire head went down underwater with the rest of him . He swallowed a mouthful of the putrid water , and struggled to sit up , coming to the surface choking and sputteringand sucking for air . The attendants solemnly reached down to help him out of the tub , and quickly he was led back to his shorts and his clothes . Tikhanov was soaking wet from the top of his head to his toes , and he wanted to dry himself , but there were no towels . With difficulty , he got into his shorts , which clamped tight to the moisture of his torso , then yanked on shirt and trousers , socks and shoes , everythingimmediately becoming soaked through by the water on his body . And then , dazed , he was outdoors again , confronting two palm trees , the bank of a hill , and a statue dedicated to " St. Margaret , Queen and Patroness of Scotland . " He glanced about , seeking a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible between himself and the miserable bathhouse . Then he saw a way out , back to the mainstream of people leaving the baths area for the grotto . Walking uncomfortably in the sun , his clothes clinging to him , hep198wondered if the immersion had cured his ailment . He could not tell . He was still walking stiffly , as if on stilts , and desired only to be dry once more . He came to a stop in an unpopulated section beside the grotto , where what was left of the sun could still be enjoyed . He remained there a moment , absorbing the sun , still feeling sticky and constricted . He shook himself like a wet dog to loosen up the clothing plastered to his body . As he did so , something untoward and unexpected happened . Something fell against his mouth and chin and fluttered to the ground . Puzzled , he stared down at his feet , and was instantly horrified at what he saw . Automatically , his hand went to his shaved upper lip , felt its total smoothness except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his immersion in the bath water , had becomeunglued and fallen off . Afraid to look around , to see if he had been seen , to note if his unmasking had been witnessed , he quickly stooped , snatched up the mustache , and in a flash pasted it back on his upper lip where it belonged . When he felt it was precariously in place again , he gulped and peered around to see if anybody had witnessed his brief exposure . He stared straight ahead , and what made his receding horror change to shock was what he saw . He saw Gisele Dupree , the bitch of a tourist guide , pointing a camera at him . His eyes widened at the sight , but then as his shock , too , receded , he realized that she might not have been focusing her camera upon him . Just before him , slightly to one side , was a grouping of pilgrims , perhaps a dozen , posing for their guide Gisele , as she shot another picture of the members of her latest tour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the grotto . He could n't decide whether Gisele had actually taken a shot of him after his mustache dropped off , or if it only seemed that she had been shooting in his direction and had actually been focused on her tour group gathered not many feet away . He could not be certain . He wanted only to turn and flee , but before he could do so , he saw Gisele lower her camera with one hand as she recognized him and smiled broadly . She waved to him with her free hand.  | " Mr. Talley ! " she called out . " How are you ? " " Fine , fine . " " You tried the baths ? " " I did . " " You must continue to do so , " she called out , " if you want to be better . " She winked . " Hope to see you again soon . " She went to join her group , and Tikhanov pivoted sharply away and put her and the grotto behind him as fast as possible . Retreating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken to him . There had not been even a hint that she had taken his picture . She had simply been surprised and pleased to see him , and that was all . He had been reacting like the worst kind of paranoiac . She had not seen . No one had seen . He was safe . And he would be cured . Reggie Moore had attired himself in his Sunday best , the pin-striped blue suit with the vest that he had last worn on the occasion of the dinner in London celebrating his partnership with Jean-Claude Jamet . Tonight , Reggie exuberantly had reminded his wife , there was to be an even bigger celebration , the reality of the partnership that would make them rich , the official opening of their remodeled and expanded restaurant in Lourdes . Before leaving London , Edith had packed her most expensive dress , the polka-dot purple satin , which she took out of the closet and put on . They had been walking from the hotel for two blocks up the Avenue Bernadette Soubirous . Despite the pleasant evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was just seven o ' - clock , and most pilgrims and tourists were dining before attending the nightly procession in the domain . At five minutes after seven , Reggie brought Edith to a halt and pointed at a corner restaurant across the street . " There it is , luv , " he said , " our very own pot of gold at the end of the rainbow . " Edith stared at the restaurant , freshly painted dark blue and orange , and she showed pleasure because Reggie was so proud and pleased . " It looks so three-star , " she said . " It is , it is , " Reggie promised her , pulling her arm more tightlyp200inside his as he started her across the street . " After the partnership was final , Jean-Claude did n't have much time to renovate . But he 'd always had plans ready . So , with my approval , he gave it a fresh paint job outside , a modern decor inside , and added to the cocktail lounge and second dining room . He threw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been smashing ever since . " " I 'm so glad , Reggie . " " But tonight makes it official . From tonight on there 's a special cover charge and special menu . " " Will people pay ? " Edith wondered . Reggie smiled at her naivete . " They 'll be glad to pay anything for a number of reasons . One , it 's not merely a routine dining room connected to a cheap hotel . Two , it is one of the few separate luxury restaurants . Three , and this is most important , we have something to offer that no one else has . " He was guiding her alongside the restaurant , and pointed upward . " Look . " Edith raised her eyes , and saw a tall neon sign glittering on and off over the glass entrance . The sign read : MADAME MOORE 'S MIRACLE RESTAURANT . Reggie 's eyes were on his wife , as her mouth fell open . " What  --  " She stood bewildered . " What does that mean ? " Reggie grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have her . " Edith stood hypnotized by the sign . " Madame Moore 's MiracleRestaurant , " she read aloud with disbelief . " Does n't that make you happy ? " " I  --  I do n't know , Reggie  --  I think I 'm embarrassed . I mean , my name in lights . Maybe that should n't be . Maybe it 's  --  " " You deserve it , you 've earned it , " said Reggie . He tugged at the door . " But that 's not all . Wait till you see what 's inside . " They were inside the doorway , and Reggie watched his wife as she took in the main dining room . It was a large room , splashed in dark blue and orange , blue walls and booths , and round tables covered with orange tablecloths . Each table was adorned with a pink rose in a slender silver vase , and each table was spotlighted by a chrome bullet light overhead . The dining room was crowded , with an overflow in the cocktail lounge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's ours , " said Reggie with pride . " Now let me show you the real surprise . " As they wove their way between the tables , they were interceptedby Jamet , who had come rushing forward . His Gallic countenancewas wreathed in a broad smile . " Welcome , Edith , " he greeted her , lifting her limp hand and kissing the back of it . " Now the evening can begin . Reggie and I will take you to your table . " It was the largest circular table in the dining room , and the only one still vacant . Propped on a holder was a white placard with gold lettering . The gold lettering read : Reserved for Edith Moore , the Miracle Woman , and Her Guests . " Oh , no  --  " Edith blurted , covering her mouth . " You deserve it , " Reggie persisted as he and Jamet showed Edith to her chair behind the placard . " I  --  I really am embarrassed , " Edith protested , forced into the chair . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And guests , what guests are we eating with ? " " Why , people who want to meet you , who are excited to meet you and hear your marvelous story , " exulted Reggie . " We printed handbills and passed them out all around Lourdes today . Dozens of visitors phoned in for reservations , enough to fill this table every night this week . Jean-Claude has never seen anything like this be-fore . " " But , Reggie , what happens after next Monday ? " " What about next Monday ? " " I wo n't be here . We 'll be going back to London . " Reggie hesitated momentarily . " I  --  I was rather hoping I might persuade you to stay another week . " " But I have my job . Still , even if that could be postponed  --  who will you have here after the second week ? " Reggie swallowed . " We are thinking of a stand-in . " " A what ? " " Someone to replace you , someone we 'll say is a close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story of your cure . Maybe she 'll also pass out photographs of you , photographs you 've signed , and people will feel blessed . "  |p202Edith  was openly distressed . " Oh , Reggie , that sounds terri-ble . " " They 'll be getting their money 's worth anyway , believe me , " Reggie said urgently . He had turned and clicked his fingers , and Jamet hastened over holding a menu aloft as he would a flag . Reggie took his partner by the sleeve . " Jean-Claude , my wife wants to know if our guests will be getting their money 's worth in the meal . Tell her . " " A feast , a pasha 's feast , " said Jamet , opening the menu , prepared to read aloud from it . " This is a deluxe dinner for this table , for this table only . " He read from the menu . " Melon Rafraichi et Jambon Cru du Pays . Followed by Aiguillettes de Canard Persillees . Then Fromage des Pyrenees . For dessert , Profiterole au Chocolat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand . " Let me see the menu . " Jamet glanced at Reggie , then shrugged and handed it to her . Her eyes skimmed it and she looked up with disapproval . " What you 're charging for that  --  I ca n't believe it . And the huge cover charge besides . " " But at this table there is a special attraction , " said Jamet , " and everyone is ready to pay . Now excuse me , I must summon the guests who are waiting . " Edith was glaring at Reggie . " I wo n't have this , Reggie . I ca n't have this . Using people like this . It is outright exploitation . " Reggie showed his exasperation . " Edith , for heaven 's sake , you 'll be helping people who need help , who want to be inspired by your case . " " Helping people is one thing . But it should be done for free . Not by making them pay through the nose . " She shook the menu . " This cheapens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think the Lord will look kindly on this . " " He 'd look kindly on a wife trying to give her husband a hand , " Reggie said desperately . He glanced off . " We 'll discuss it more later . Jean-Claude is coming with the guests . Edith , be nice to them . Tell your story . Answer their questions . " Jamet was already seating the guests , and introducing them to Edith and Reggie as they took their chairs . Jamet reeled off thep203introductions smoothly . " Mr. Samuel Talley from New York , whom I understand Mrs. Moore has already met . . . Miss Natale Rinaldi from Rome , and Mr. Mikel Hurtado from Madrid . It is Madrid , is n't it ? . . . Mr. and Mrs. Pascal from Bordeaux . . . Mrs. Farrell and her son , Master Jimmy , from Toronto . " Jamet moved in behind Jimmy , a nine-year-old boy in a wheelchair . " Here , Jimmy , let me pull away the regular chair and get you in to the table properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moore , with whom both Mr. and Mrs. Moore have had a five years ' acquaintance , is Dr. Berryer , the distinguished head of the Lourdes Medical Bureau . Now you know one another . If you will excuse me , I must tend to the other tables . " There was an awkward void after Jamet left , but Dr. Berryer quickly filled it . " How are you , Edith ? I must say you are looking more fit than ever . " " I 'm fine , thank you , Dr. Berryer , " Edith said , a trifle sullenly . " She 's better than fine , " Reggie boomed out . " She 's great . " " The red-letter day is the day after tomorrow , " said Dr. Berryer . " The specialist from Paris , Dr. Kleinberg , is arriving in Lourdes late tomorrow night . You 'll have an appointment to see him Wednesday morning , but I will phone you before then to confirm the hour . " " Thank you , " said Edith . Dr. Berryer took in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talley from New York , " he said . " We met in your hotel . I showed you to the baths . Did you find them ? " " I took a bath , " said Tikhanov , somewhat disgruntled . " I found the process extremely uncomfortable . " Here Edith could not help but interject herself . " It is not necessary that you be comfortable , Mr. Talley . Ideally , you should come here to do penance . Back in 1858 , when Bernadette had her eighth visitation from the Virgin Mary , the Virgin told her , ' Go and kiss the ground as a penance for sinners . ' Mr. Talley , you must regard the discomfort of the baths as a similar penance . " Tikhanov nodded solemnly . " You were kind to me at lunch . I came to this dinner for added reinforcement from you . Now I have it . I will go to the baths again tomorrow . "  |p204At  this point , Natale spoke up . " Mrs. Moore , let me tell you why I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my affliction . " " I am , Miss Rinaldi . " " When I returned from the grotto late this afternoon , " said Natale , " my friend and helper , Rosa Zennaro , accompanied me to my hotel room , but had to excuse herself before dinner . As she left , a neighbor in the hotel who has been nice to me  --  Mr. Hurtado who is sitting next to me  --  was entering his room and he overheard Rosa and offered to bring me dinner . Meanwhile , he was showing me into my room when he found the handbill under the door about dinner at this restaurant and the opportunity to meet you , Mrs. Moore . I was enthusiastic about the prospect , so Mr. Hurtado offered to bring me here . " Hurtado gave off a shrug . " Also , I was very hungry . " Natale laughed , and addressed herself in Edith 's direction once more . " Mrs. Moore , what I wish to discuss with you is this . I have devoted all of my time here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baths because I thought it would be difficult . " " There are women attendants to help you , " said Edith , and added with compassion , " You must try the baths . " " I come to this question  --  are the baths the most important means of achieving a cure ? " " That can not be answered exactly , " said Edith . " Speaking only for myself , I was instantly cured after bathing in the water from the spring . But others have been miraculously cured after praying at the grotto , after drinking the water , after marching in the procession . Dr. Berryer is really the authority on the cures . " Dr. Berryer dipped his head toward Natale . " You can even be cured after departing Lourdes and upon your return home . It has happened . There are no rules , no formula , for how and when the cure will happen , if it does happen . " " So it can happen after any act or profession of faith , " said Natale . " Apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to Lourdes , I made a study of all the sixty-four cures from 1858 to 1978 recognized as miraculous by the church . It will interest you to know , Miss Rinaldi , that the very second cure authenticated asp205miraculous was for a fifty-four-year-old man afflicted , at least partially , as you are . Louis Bouriette of this city had suffered an eye injury twenty years earlier , and for two years had actually been blind in his right eye when his sight was restored at the grotto . " " The cure really happened ? " said Natale eagerly . " It certainly happened , defying all medical explanations , " said Dr. Berryer . " All those sixty-four miraculous cures I studied defied medicine  --  a young woman with a leg ulcer with extensive gangrene , a nun suffering pulmonary tuberculosis , a woman with cancerof the uterine cervix , an Italian gentleman with Hodgkin 's disease , an Italian youth afflicted with sarcoma of the pelvis , such as Edith Moore had  --  all given up by their doctors , yet cured because of the shrine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these miracles occurred after bathing . But authenticated miracle cure number fifty-eight , that of Alice Couteault , and cure fifty-nine , that of Marie Bigot , took place during the Processions of the Blessed Sacrament . Yet others , among the first sixty-four , occurred after prayer before the grotto . I am still studying several that have happened since , and at least one of these cures I recall took place in the midst of prayer at the grotto . You would be wise to try everything available to you , Miss Rinaldi , not only praying at the grotto , but drinking the water , visiting the baths , even walking in the processions if you can manage it . " " But certainly the baths , you must try the baths , " insisted Edith . From across the table , the doughy Canadian mother , Mrs. Farrell , spoke up . " You were saying you , yourself , were cured after bathing . " " That is correct , " said Edith . " It would be a true revelation to us , to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you would tell us how the miracle happened to you . " " Go on , Edith , " Reggie urged his wife , " tell them how it happened . I 'm sure everyone here wants to know . " Edith shot him a lethal glare , and then , turning back to the others she affected a transformation as neatly as an actress , offeredp206one and all an engaging smile , and ignoring the food being served , she patiently went into her practiced recital . As the guests sat mesmerized , only Dr. Berryer constantly bobbing his head in confirmation , Edith spoke of the gradual onset of her illness , the endless tests in London , and the final verdict that she had been suffering a sarcoma . Then , when all hope seemed lost , her parish priest , Father Woodcourt , had suggested a visit to Lourdes with his pilgrimage group . Listening intently to her familiar story Reggie tried to judge his wife 's temper from her tone . So aware was he of every nuance of her speech that , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straining to be level and even-tempered . Beneath there boiled a lava of displeasure with him that might erupt at any moment . While pretending to be closely attentive , Reggie glanced off toward the cocktail lounge and caught Jamet 's eye . Reggie nodded mysteriously . Jamet , as if understanding , nodded back , and disappeared into the lounge . Reggie appeared to hang on every word his wife was speaking , but from the corner of his eye he was on the lookout for something else . Then Jamet reappeared leading a cleric toward the table , keeping to the rear of Edith . The clergyman , a tall , imposing figure in a Roman collar and dark suit , came quietly to a chair Jamet had placed behind Edith . The clergyman settled into it , and cocked his head the better to hear what Edith was telling the others . The courses came and went , and Edith 's story progressed to her second Lourdes visit , to the last day of the visit and the final bath , when she had emerged no longer disabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambulatory . Reggie noted , and was pleased , at the reaction of the first-night audience to Edith 's opening performance . The American Talley was grunting his pleasure , the blind Italian girl 's angelic countenancereflected happy wonder , the Canadian mother and the French couple were delighted with the miracle . What followed from his wife , Reggie knew , the certification of the cure from the many doctors at the Lourdes Medical Bureau , was anticlimax but an added sweetener more delicious than the profiteroles everyone had just finished consuming.  |p207Then  it was over , the dinner and Edith 's miracle , and the adults were rising , thanking her profusely , everyone inspired and grateful , and leaving now in a rush for the domain and the evening procession , everyone with reinforced optimism that they too might be saved in this momentous Reappearance Time . When the last of the guests disappeared , Edith and Reggie were alone at the oversized table . Immediately , Edith turned on her husband . Her bland face was contorted again in anger . " Now are you satisfied ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , he touched his wife 's shoulder , and said , " Edith , you have one more guest who wanted to hear you . Look behind you . " Puzzled , Edith jerked around in her chair and saw the priest rising from his seat . " Father Ruland , " Edith murmured . Reggie beamed , observing yet another and expected transformationon his wife 's face . Her entire expression had softened . Reggie was aware that Father Ruland , the most intellectual and urbane of the Catholic churchmen in Lourdes , was a particular favorite of Edith 's . " Delighted to have you back in full health , Mrs. Moore , " said Father Ruland in his courtly manner , bending his head without displacing a strand of his long sandy hair in a bow of appreciation , " and do forgive me for eavesdropping . I 'd never heard your story in company , and I would n't allow myself to miss it . You asked your husband if he was satisfied . I am sure he is , and I can tell you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and to everyone in attendance . I , for one , want to thank you for sharing it with us . " If a person could melt in a puddle , Edith had done so . All anger had evaporated . Her countenance reflected only the purest joy . " Father Ruland , you are too generous . This coming from you means so much to me . " " You have earned and deserved whatever we humble members of the church can offer you , " Father Ruland went on suavely . " You were blessed by the Holy Virgin , and all of us , through you , are secondarily blessed . I want to congratulate you on the verificationof your miraculous cure , which will take place this week . I prayp208that the Virgin Mary will consider you as the one to whom She may show herself . " " Oh , I pray that might be so , " said Edith fervently . " Also , " added Father Ruland , " I want to thank you on behalf of our entire order for foregoing your privacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yourself to the great number of pilgrims who wish to join you nightly at your dinner table . I trust you will not find it too much of an ordeal . " " It 's an honor , and a pleasure , Father Ruland , " said Edith breathlessly . " If I could be sure I am worthy of all this fuss and attention  --  " " You could do nothing better , I assure you , Mrs. Moore , " said Father Ruland . " Oh , thank you , thank you . " Reggie had come to his feet . " Let me see you out , Father . " He looked over his shoulder . " I 'll be right back , Edith . " " I 'll be waiting , darling , " said Edith sweetly . Reggie walked Father Ruland across the dining room to the door . Speaking in an undertone , Reggie said , " Father , you know how much Jean-Claude and I appreciate that . You have our everlastingthanks . " With a touch of levity , he added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your dinners are on the house . " Then serious again , " Father , you saved my neck . Maybe I 'll be able to do something for you one day . " " Maybe you will . " Reggie reached out to clasp the priest 's hand . " Anyway , once more , thanks . You 've served a good cause . " Father Ruland smiled . " It 's our cause , one and the same cause . " And he went out the door . Long after dinner , and after he had left Natale at her room , and gone to his own , Mikel Hurtado prepared to return to the grotto area . It was before midnight when he finished packing his sticks of dynamite , wiring , detonator , and other equipment , into a shopping bag . He had selected his locations above the grotto , and all thatp209remained was to plant and wire his explosives in the darkness and quiet of the night . It should be safe , he told himself . The shrine would be emptied of pilgrims and tourists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he has seen , was practically nonexistent . The act was open and shut . He would lay down the explosives . He would set the time clock for the detonation . He would bring his single suitcase to the European Ford he had rented under another name , using the doctored passport and driver 's license of his French Basque colleague . He would be many kilometers out of town , and free , when the grotto blew up . Good-bye grotto . Good-bye Virgin Mary . Sorry , good believers , but there was a cause more important for the grotto to serve  --  a cause that meant good-bye to Spanish enslavement of the Basques . Once his shopping bag was filled , Hurtado stepped out into the corridor , proceeded past Natale 's door , thinking briefly of her and of her warmth and ravishing beauty ( what a pity he would not see her again ) , and went to the elevator . He rode the elevator down to the reception lobby , holding the shopping bag tightly at his side , and left the hotel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He walked clown the avenue , and strode to the corner of the Boulevard de la Grotte . At the corner , about to cross over the ramp leading down to the grotto , he stopped in his tracks . Across the way , at the head of the ramp , there was life . Gatheredat the top of the ramp was a group of men in blue uniforms , members of the Lourdes police , standing near two of their white and red squad cars , two station wagons with flashing blue lights on top . Glancing to his left , Hurtado saw that the cafe , Le Royale , was still open , and the tables empty , but apparently it was near closing time . Hurtado considered wandering over to the cafe and taking a table for a cup of coffee , but quickly vetoed the move as making him , a loner with his bag , too conspicuous . If the police saw him watching them from this corner , they might become curious . No , this was too conspicuous , also . Rattled , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores . He felt certain that this police gatheringwould soon break up and it would be safe to go down to the Rosary Esplanade and the grotto and do what he had planned to do all evening . Hurtado slouched along by himself for fifteen minutes , and finally turned back and took another fifteen minutes to retrace his steps to the corner . This half hour would be enough to rid the area of police and clear the way for him . But once he had arrived at the corner , he was surprised again . The police had not dispersed at all . In fact , their number had increased . There were ten men in blue uniforms there now at the head of the ramp . And one of them , a beefy officer with a map in one hand , appeared to be speaking to the others . Hurtado pulled back out of sight completely . He decided that it would be unwise to hang around , to be seen alone at this hour , possibly to be questioned . He tried to think why the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the afternoon , in some shop , that Lourdes had been invaded by pickpockets , common thieves , even prostitutes from other cities , mostly from Marseilles . No wonder the police had gathered , while it was quiet , to plan their strategy for law enforcement . Hurtado turned away once more , and trudged toward the Hotel Gallia &; Londres . There was no choice but to rest one more night , and wait for tomorrow . He would do it all tomorrow . He would get lost in the mass of humanity going down to the domain during the day , and slip up into the foliage above the grotto to hide his shopping bag . Then he would return tomorrow night at this same hour and set the detonator . What the hell , the Virgin Mary deserved a day 's reprieve.  |p211Father  Ruland himself had arranged the site for the first and only press conference that the church would hold in Lourdes during The Reappearance Time , the little-used but solid-appearing buildingknown to the townsfolk as the Palais des Congres  --  Palace of the Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscaping where , from time to time , meetings were conducted by a cardinal from the Vatican or the mayor of Lourdes . The arrangement inside , Father Ruland had decided during the selection process , was perfect for convening the international press . There was a great central auditorium that held as many as Boo visitors in individual chairs . Two steps led up from the stage to the semicircle of the wooden rostrum upon which was centered a lecternand microphone . With the bishop of Tarbes and Lourdes promised as the repre/sentative of the church and the main attraction , the press conferencehad been called for nine o'clock in the morning . Now , in a private office of the Palace of the Congress , the wall clock told Father Ruland it was eleven minutes after nine . Michelle Demalliot , head of the Sanctuaries Press Bureau , came breathlessly into the office from the auditorium , nervously running a hand through her dark-blond hair and announced , " They are all in their seats , a large turnout , and waiting . And getting restless . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representing the Lourdes Merchants Association , and she asked , " He 's not here yet ? " " Not yet , " said Father Ruland . " However , I spoke to the bishop just last night and he assured me that he would be here at nine . " " Listen , " said Jamet . They could hear someone approaching the side door . Father Ruland stepped over to the door and pulled it open , and was relieved to see Bishop Peyragne parting from his driver , a young priest , and nearing the door . As the lanky , elderly bishop of Tarbes and Lourdes came into the office , they all welcomed him . Father Ruland was particularly pleased to see the bishop so aristocratic in appearance with his elaborate pectoral cross hanging on a gold chain against his black cassock . Ruland liked his bishops tall and gaunt or round and pudgy . They looked more like princes of the church . And especially when they were attired in their vestments . The bishop would awe and contain the journalists . " Sorry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but I was delayed by a call from Rome . Well , now , I suppose I 'm ready . Do you want to bring the reporters in ? " Father Ruland swallowed . " Uh , I 'm not sure that would be possible , Your Excellency . There are at least three hundred journalistsin the auditorium waiting for your press conference . " The bishop 's long face darkened . " Press conference ? What are you saying ? When you spoke to me of seeing the press , I assumed you were arranging for me to meet with a half dozen reporters at most . But a press conference  --  "  | " I 'm sorry I was misunderstood , " said Father Ruland . " But we had no way of limiting it  --  " " I do n't like circuses , " the bishop growled . " Your Excellency , " Father Ruland continued , unruffled , " the world press is here in great numbers for the same reason we are here , to await the miraculous return of the blessed Holy Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be denied , " added Michelle . " We could not show favoritism in the invitations . " Jamet moved closer to the bishop . " Your Excellency , not only do those newspaper and magazine reporters deserve to know what is expected at the grotto , so that they can write about it , but they will write about Lourdes as well . The eyes of the entire civilized world are on Lourdes this week . The well-being of our town , our shrine , depends very much on your cooperation . What the press reports will help sustain the town of Lourdes as well as of the domain itself . " The bishop grunted , and spoke to Michelle . " Who 's out there ? Where are those people from ? " he demanded . " From everywhere and the most important , " said Michelle . " International television reporters , of course , but no cameras in accordance with our policy . Also newspaper and magazine reportersfrom the Times in New York and the Times of London . Reportersfrom Der Spiegel of Hamburg , Aftonbladet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tokyo , La Stampa of Turin , Newsweek of New York , our own Le Figaro of Paris . There is even a priest-informer  --  as the Vatican calls its reporters  --  here to cover this for L'Osservatore Romano . " Mention of Vatican City 's own semiofficial newspaper seemed to affect the bishop favorably . " Well , now , perhaps I should start with a personal statement about the impending Reappearance . " " Not necessary , Your Excellency , " said Father Ruland . " I 'll lead you out onto the rostrum and introduce you . Then I will request the members of the press to raise their hands if they have questions . You will point to certain reporters at random , and each will rise and pose a question . You will answer as briefly or as fully as you desire . I warn you , some of the questions may not be worthy of reply , but  --  "  | " Never mind , " said the bishop . " How much time am I expected to give them ? " " A half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Longer only if you wish . At any rate , I 'll approach the lectern at the end of a half hour . " The bishop fingered the pectoral cross on his chest . " Very well , " he said gruffly , " let 's go in and get it over with . " Liz Finch , wearing her pale-blue linen suit , sat expectantly in the second row of the auditorium , open notebook in her lap , pencil in her hand , waiting as the good-looking priest , Father Ruland , finished his introduction of the bishop of Tarbes and Lourdes . " Now His Excellency will reply to your questions , " announcedFather Ruland over the microphone . " Those of you with questions , please raise your hands to be acknowledged . When you are addressed , please rise , give your affiliation , and state your questions as clearly and briefly as possible . Ladies and gentlemen , I turn the conference over to the bishop of Tarbes and Lourdes . " Father Ruland stepped aside and gracefully retreated to the background , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black robe and gold cross tramp to the microphone at the lectern . As hands began to shoot up around the crowded auditorium , Liz kept her own hands resting on her notebook . She had only one question to ask , and it would be best to save it for the end , when most of the pious nonsense was over with . The bishop was pointing to a man in the front row . The man came to his feet . " Toronto Star of Canada , " he said . " Your original announcement was that the Virgin Mary would reappear in Lourdes between August 14 and 22 . Here we are on the morning of August 16 . How would we know if she had already been seen ? " " The event would have been announced immediately after it occurred . Obviously , it has not occurred yet . " Another man , next to the Canadian , had raised his hand and was already on his feet . " But you are certain the Virgin Mary will reappear here during one of the last five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Die Welt of Hamburg . " The bishop offered a bleak smile . " Since the Virgin confidedp215the approximate date of Her return to Saint Bernadette , I feel certain that the Virgin will keep Her word . " " But perhaps Bernadette miscalculated ? " " No , " the bishop replied , " Bernadette was exact in her journal  --  thisyear , this month , these eight days . " The bishop pointed to someone in a back row . " Yes ? " A youngish woman rose . " Your Excellency , I 'm with Le Monde of Paris . When the Virgin Mother appears , will she be seen by only one person or more than one ? " The bishop shrugged . " I can not say . If it is the same as it was in 1858 , the Virgin Mother will be seen by only one . " Liz Finch heard a movement and glanced over her shoulder . The man seated behind her had come out of his chair . " BBC , London . Will the apparition show herself only at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Lourdes ? " The bishop answered , " Her message was explicit as to place , and it is likely that She will not only appear within the domain , but at the grotto itself . After all , it is familiar to Her . " A woman at the rear had been acknowledged and was standing. " 11 Messaggero of Rome . I wonder what she will be wearing ? " Liz Finch could see the bishop repressing a smile , as he answered . " When it comes to fashion , I am out of my depth . " There was laughter in the auditorium , immediately hushed by the bishop 's solemnity . " Bernadette originally saw the Virgin Mary garmented in white . As Bernadette stated , ' I saw a Lady dressed in white , wearing a white dress , a blue girdle , and a yellow rose on each foot , the same color as the chain of Her rosary : The beads of Her rosary were white . ' " The bishop paused , and added dryly , " It is unlikely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much affect on the Lady 's attire . Next question ? " A Japanese gentleman was waving , standing . " From Tokyo Asahi Shimbun , " he called out . " Have you speculated about what the Lady may have to say to the one who sees her ? " The bishop shook his head . " Only God knows  --  God , His Son , and the Virgin Mary . When it happens , we too shall know . " Liz Finch listened intently to the unreality of the continuing questions and answers.  | " Your Excellency , I am from 0 Globo of Rio de Janeiro . Excellency , our readers wonder  --  when the Virgin reappears , will she cure someone who is an invalid ? " " Yes , She told Bernadette She would . On the other hand we know that long ago when Bernadette was ailing , even though she saw the Virgin Mary , she was not cured . Indeed , Bernadette sought a cure elsewhere . " Liz Finch blinked , and began to scribble a note . The bishop was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not promise to make you happy in this world but in the next . ' " " Your Excellency , I represent The New York Times . In the event of a nonappearance . . . if the Virgin Mary does not appear  --  that is to say , is seen by no one  --  what will be the Church 's position ? " " Sir , the Church will not need a position . We devoutly believe in the Holy Mother , and She has promised that She will appear in Lourdes this week . Of that , no one in the Church has a doubt . Each of us dedicated to God , from the Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church in the Vatican to all of his servants , fervently believes that the Immaculate Conception will reappear in one of the five days ahead . " Liz Finch stirred in her seat , eyes on the dial of her wristwatch . This was the moment for her own question . She must pose it before the conference ended . There were many hands beckoning for attention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise and relief , the bishop was pointing at her . Liz jumped to her feet . " Bishop Peyragne , I 'm from AmalgamatedPress International of New York , from the Paris Bureau , and I have this question . Taking into account Bernadette 's age at the time of the apparitions  --  fourteen , I believe , an adolescent , and unlettered  --  could it not be possible that the secret she heard from the Virgin Mary and noted in her private journal might have been more  --  more wish than factual reporting ? " Ignoring the brief stir in the audience , Liz reiterated her question in another form . " In short , Your Excellency , how can the Church be positive that what Bernadette set down in her journal about the Virgin 's reappearance this year , this month , these days , was actually what she thought that the Virgin had told her ? "  |p217The  bishop of Tarbes and Lourdes , from his elevated place , was staring down at Liz , and there was a long pause . At last , he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saint Bernadette , we do know one thing that is absolutely beyond question . Bernadettewas honest , she was unfailingly honest . She was tested and never once found wanting . She was ever truthful . She sought neithermonetary gain nor fame . She wished only to be the conduit of a voice and message brought down from heaven . She would not enter anything in her journal that the Virgin Mary had not told her . She would enter only the truth . " Writing , Liz Finch felt the bishop 's eyes were still piercing her . She looked up and saw that his concentrated stare was holding on her . Momentarily , he was inattentive to the other hands in the auditorium . He seemed to have something more to say to Liz herself . He bent closer to the microphone . " Let me add this word . I am well acquainted with Bernadette , but I would not claim to have delved as deeply into her life as others . If you have any doubts about Bernadette 's integrity , I would suggest that you speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a biographer of Bernadette . " He gestured behind him toward Father Ruland who was seated calmly between Michelle and Jamet . " I would suggest you see Father Ruland . I am sure he can dispel any doubts you may harbor . " The bishop looked off at the forest of arms . " Now let us proceed . I see there are more questions . " Father Ruland was at the lectern , thanking the journalists and adjourning the press conference . The bishop , followed by Jamet and Michelle , was exiting from the stage . As he did so , there was an unaccountable smattering of applause from the assembly of reporters . Liz Finch watched the bishop leaving , and in her mind she continued to feel the intensity in his burning eyes when he had stared at her . Those Holy Joes , she thought , with their fanatical fever of piety . The unbending strength of their belief made her shudder . Then she directed her attention to Father Ruland , still at thep218lectern , observing the breakup of the press conference . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered if it could be for her . Scrambling to her feet , tucking the notebook and pencil into her purse , Liz hastened down the aisle to the stage . She strode up to Father Ruland , and , indeed , he appeared to be expecting her . " Father , " she said , " I 'm Liz Finch . Perhaps you remember that the good bishop suggested I speak to you about Bernadette . " Father Ruland 's mouth crooked slightly . " Yes , Miss Finch , I do remember . " " Perhaps you can spare me a few minutes now , or would you rather I make an appointment for later ? " " Miss Finch , crowded as my calendar is with appointments , I think I can fit you in right now for fifteen or twenty minutes , if that will do ? " " It will do fine . " " Follow me . " She trailed his imposing figure off the platform and went with him as he entered an austere office . The priest signaled Liz to the chair in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching into a jacket pocket . " Do you mind if I smoke ? " " Not if you do n't mind if I do . " She sat , digging into her purse , came up with her packet and shook free a cigarette and put her lighter to it . He 'd found his box of cigarillos and busied himself putting a match to one . She held her gaze on him , trying to assess him . If he had not become a priest , he might have been a matinee idol . He was much too male and attractive to be wasted on celibacy . His long sandy hair and eyelashes , the faintly Mongolian cast to his eyes , the sensuouslips , really too much . But there was more , she sensed . A suavity colored by a brush of cynicism . Perhaps a politician priest , as well as a historian . Surely a worldly priest . But what was he doing , then , cooped up in a provincial tank town like Lourdes ? Why not in Rome and in the Holy See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a tank town , far more , a notable adjunct to the Vatican in fact . Here was also where the action was , especially in this elongated week , a municipal stage for exposure and action . Thep219Pope would know who his most effective servants were . Presently , for certain , this Father Ruland would wind up in Rome where he belonged . Liz came out of her reverie to realize that Father Ruland was seated across from her , puffing his cigarillo , and contemplating her with mild amusement . She was briefly disconcerted . She sat up , taking one more pull at her cigarette , leaning forward to grind it out in a ceramic ashtray on the desk . " I  --  I am glad you could see me , Father . Perhaps I 'd better tell you exactly who I am , what I do , and what I 'm after in Lourdes . " Father Ruland 's voice was lazy . " I know who you are , Miss Finch , I know what you do , and I know what you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What am I after ? " she challenged him defiantly . " You are after Bernadette , " he said pleasantly . " You want her scalp . At least , so I heard before the press conference . Your questionfor the bishop confirms it . You regard Bernadette as a fake . Well , Miss Finch , it may relieve you to know you are not alone . For in her own time , Bernadette , at least at the outset of the apparitions , was very much doubted and considered a fake by many authori-ties . " Ah , he 's one of those smooth snakes , thought Liz , one of those in the business of disarming . The tactic was not unfamiliar to a veteran interviewer . Utter frankness and candor that made you lower your guard . Then whamo , straight to the chin . She had dealt with the Father Rulands , those without Roman collars , before , and often . Still what made this appetizing and fun was that he did wear a Roman collar and he was ready to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No kidding ? " said Liz , playing along . " Some of her contemporariesactually considered Bernadette a fake ? " " Absolutely , " said Father Ruland . " After Bernadette had seen the first apparition of the lady in white , she intended to keep it to herself . She did not mean to tell anyone about the visitation . Then her younger sister , Toinette , wheedled it out of her . The sister spilled out the story to their mother Louise , ' Bernadette saw a whitep220girl in the grotto of Massabielle . ' Louise demanded to know exactly what Bernadette had seen . Bernadette told her mother about the lady . Louise , considering the troubles the family had already had  --  failures in business , evictions from homes , a period in prison her husband had served  --  angrily struck Bernadette with a stick , and cried out , You did n't see anything but a white rock . I forbid you to go back there . ' Her father , Francois , also forbade Bernadette to return to the grotto . Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who treated what she had seen more seriously , Bernadette went back to the grotto and saw the Virgin a second time . Bernadette fell into such a deep trance , that an adult , a miller , had to be summoned to lift her and bring her away . " " But her parents eventually came around ? " " Eventually , but not immediately , " said Father Ruland . " In fact , the following day , after the word had spread to Bernadette 's school , the Mother Superior demanded to know if she was through with her carnival extravaganzas , ' and one of the nuns actually slapped Bernadette on the cheek . Nevertheless , Bernadette was drawn back to the grotto a third time , this time accompanied by two curious women who insisted that she have the apparition write down its name . For a third time the apparition appeared , and Bernadettereported that she asked the white lady her name and the lady replied , ' It is not necessary . ' And then added , Would you have the graciousness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By her sixth visit , as many as one hundred people came to watch her in prayer and her mother was among them . " " But there were those who doubted the girl 's stories ? " " Yes , definitely , " agreed Father Ruland again . " As I told you , there were important personages in Lourdes who doubted her , regarded her as a faker , a daydreamer , an ignorant youngster sufferinghallucinations . One of these was the town 's police commissioner , Jacomet , and he hauled little Bernadette in for an interrogation . After learning that she was no more than fourteen , unable to read or write , and had not made her First Communion , Jacomet said to her , So then , Bernadette , you see the Holy Virgin ? ' She snapped back , ' I do not say that I have seen the Holy Virgin . ' Jacomet exclaimed , Ah , good ! You have n't seen anything ! ' Bernadettep221persisted , ' Yes , I did see something ... Something white . . . That thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The police commissioner pushed on . ' And that thing did not say to you , " I am the Holy Virgin " ? ' Bernadette would not retreat . ' She did not say that to me . ' Jacomet 's interrogation went on and on . Finally , he lost patienceand said , ' Listen , Bernadette , everyone is laughing at you . They say that you are crazy . For your own sake , you must not go back to the grotto anymore . ' " Father Ruland leaned forward against his desk , and went on speaking . " Bernadette insisted that she must go back , that she had promised the white lady she would return for fifteen days . Jacomet had been writing down everything Bernadette had recounted , and now he read his notes to her . ' You stated , the Virgin smiles at me . ' Bernadette objected . ' I did n't say the Virgin . ' Jacomet read further . Bernadette interrupted once more . ' Sir , you have altered everything on me . ' At last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Drunken sot , brazen hussy , little whore ! You are getting everyone to run after you . ' Bernadette replied calmly , ' I do n't tell anyone to go there . ' But Jacomet would continue to oppose her , and she would continue to defy him . " Liz Finch could not help but be impressed . " She was a nervy little girl . " Father Ruland nodded his agreement . " She saw what she saw , and was unshakable in describing what she had seen . " Liz wanted to know more about the opposition . " And were there others in Lourdes at the time , I mean persons whom people looked up to , who also believed that Bernadette was a fake ? " " Many , many , " said Father Ruland . " The Imperial Prosecutor Dutour interrogated her . He wanted her word that she would not return to the grotto , since it was disrupting the community . Bernadettetold him that she had promised the lady she would go there . Dutour said , one presumes acidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sees is n't worth anything . You must stay away . ' Bernadette replied , ' I feel a great deal of joy when I go there . ' Dutour said , ' Joy is a bad counsellor . Listen instead to the Sisters , who told you chat it was an illusion . ' Bernadette replied that she was drawn to the grow ) by an irresistible force . Dutour threatened her with prison ,  |p222but  finally gave up . A number of priests cross-examined Bernadette . One , a Jesuit named Father Negre , insisted that she had seen the devil . Bernadette replied , ' The devil is not as beautiful as she . ' There was even some talk in town , among the intellectual doubters , that she might be insane  --  " " Insane ? " said Liz with surprise . " Oh , yes . So in due course three well-known doctors in Lourdes were asked to examine Bernadette . They did so . They found her nervous and , of course , asthmatic , but anything but insane , in fact quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a not-uncommon childish hallucination . Speaking of Bernadette'sfirst vision , the doctors reported , ' A reflection of light , no doubt , caught her attention at the side of the grotto ; her imagination , under the influence of a mental predisposition , gave it a form which impresses children , that of the statues of the Virgin that are seen on altars . ' The three doctors concluded that once the crowds ceased giving her attention and following her , Bernadette would forget the illusion and settle down into her normal way of life and routine . " Father Ruland smiled . " Which tells us something about how wrong doctors can be , or could be in those days . But the most important resistance to Bernadette 's story came from the leading priest in Lourdes  --  " " Father Peyramale , " interjected Liz , to let Ruland know thatshe had done some homework and was not entirely uninformed . " Yes , Peyramale , " said Father Ruland . " From the first , he wasthe strongest doubter . He simply would not take Bernadette 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , impatient , short-tempered although decent and kindly underneath . Itwas after the thirteenth time that Bernadette had seen the apparitionthat she came before Father Peyramale , accompanied by twoaunts . She had a message from the lady in the grotto . The lady'smessage was , ' Go and tell the priests that people are to come herein procession and build a chapel here . ' Father Peyramale was notcharmed . He addressed Bernadette sarcastically . ' You 're the onewho goes to the grotto ? And you say you see the Holy Virgin ? ' Bernadette would not buckle under . ' I did not say that it is the HolyVirgin . ' Peyramale demanded , ' Then who is the lady ? ' Bernadettep223replied , ' I do n't know . ' Peyramale lost his temper . ' So , you do n't know ! Liar ! Yet those you get to run after you and the newspapers say that you claim to see the Holy Virgin . Well , then , what do you see ? ' Bernadette answered , ' Something that resembles a lady . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lady ! A procession ! ' He glared at her aunts , whom he had thrown out of a church society for becoming pregnant while unmarried , and spoke savagely to them . ' It is unfortunate to have a family like this , which creates disorder in the town . Keep her in check and do n't let her budge again . Get out of here ! ' " " What disorder was Bernadette responsible for ? " Liz wanted to know . " The crowds at the grotto were growing . At first a few had watched Bernadette 's trances , then 150 , then 400 , and soon 1,500 people gathered to witness her visions , and finally as many as 10,000 . " " Did she ever see Father Peyramale again ? " " Frequently , " said Ruland . " In fact , the very evening after he had thrown her out , she returned to see him once more . He had calmed down somewhat , and he asked Bernadette about the lady once more . ' You still do n't know what her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reverend Father . ' Peyramale advised Bernadette , ' Well , then , you must ask her . ' After the fourteenth apparition , Bernadette returned to the rectory and said to Peyramale , ' ReverendFather , the lady still wants the chapel . ' Peyramale said , ' Did you ask her for her name ? ' Bernadette said , ' Yes , but she only smiled . ' Probably , Peyramale smiled , too . ' She is having a lot of fun with you ! . . . If she wants the chapel , let her tell you her name . ' When Bernadette saw the lady for the sixteenth time , she boldly asked the lady , ' Madame , will you be so kind as to tell me who you are ? ' According to Bernadette , the lady bowed , smiled , clasped her hands at her breast and replied , ' I am the Immaculate Conception . ' Bernadette raced to the rectory and repeated what she had heard . Peyramale was thunderstruck . ' A woman can not have that name , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what that means ? ' Bernadette had no idea what it meant . Actually , the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary  --  that Christ'sp224purity at birth extended to his mother Mary at birth  --  was a highly sophisticated dogma announced by the Pope only four years earlier to help create a religious revival . That anyone as unschooled and ignorant as Bernadette could know about it seemed impossible . Father Peyramale was stunned . In my opinion , from that moment on , Peyramale was no longer a doubter . He believed everything that Bernadette had reported to him and would continue to tell him . From that moment on , he was on her side , one of her main backers . " " And that 's what did it , " said Liz . " Not quite , but Peyramale 's conversion was indeed a turning point , " said Father Ruland . " But there were other factors , too , that dissipated doubt , and weighed the scales in favor of Bernadette 's honesty . There was the cynical Dr. Dozous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw her hold a burning candle in her hands while the flame crept down to her fingers . Afterward , when the doctor examinedher hands , they showed no burns . There was the highly respectedtax inspector , Jean-Baptiste Estrade , who mocked Bernadetteuntil he saw her at the grotto , and who thought her performance was greater than any by the French actress Rachel , and that convinced him she was honest . Estrade came away saying , ' That child has a supernatural being in front of her . ' Then the whole succession of early miracles . " " What miracles ? " Liz wondered . " The son of a tobacco seller who had sight in only one eye . He drank some of the water from the spring Bernadette had discoveredand was able to see with both eyes . There was Catherine Latapie , who had fallen from a tree and partially paralyzed her right hand . At the grotto , after she dipped the hand in the stream , her paralysis disappeared . There was Eugenie Troy , whose vision was impaired and whose eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most publicized cure was that of Napoleon III 's two-year-old son , heir to the French throne , who had suffered a serious sunstroke in Biarritz . There was fear that the sunstroke might lead to meningitis . His governess traveled to Lourdes , spoke to Bernadette , filled a bottle with the spring water , and sprinkled it on the suffering prince . With that , his sunstrokep225vanished . And with that the Emperor ordered Lourdes and the grotto opened freely to the public . From then on , it became the most attended religious shrine in the Western world . " " Sounds to me like the cures really did it , " said Liz . Father Ruland hiked his shoulders , and said casually , " Make what you want of the cures , but Bernadette herself never thought too much of them . She was a very sick little girl , as you know , suffering from severe asthma and undernourishment . When she was extremely ill , she did not go to the grotto . She had no faith in its curative powers . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kilometers from here . It was a spa and she went there for the thermal baths . But they did not cure her . " " Still , Bernadette went there . " " Because the spa was highly spoken of in her day . " " I might look in on it , if I have time . " " It 's not very interesting , but if you go there have a look at the church , Notre-Dame de Cauterets , and especially the modern chapel inside the church , the Chapelle Sainte Bernadette . Request the local priest to show you around  --  I forget his name  --  Father Cayoux , I think , I 'm not sure . But , I repeat , there 's not much else to see . " He took out his box of cigarillos , and sought a fresh one . " Anyway , there it is , the whole series of events that made Lourdes what it is , the succession of events that happened and , of course , the cures for so many except Bernadette . " Liz had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slowly , allowing a few seconds of silence to elapse , and then she inquired innocently , " Was n't there something more that made the grotto notable ? " " Something more ? " " I read that politics played a major role in its fame . " " Politics  --  " repeated Father Ruland , knitting his brow . " Ah , you mean the showdown for control between Peyramale and FatherSempe . Is that what you mean ? " " I think so . What happened ? " " Well , to put it in a nutshell , after the area 's bishop , Laurence by name , had appointed a commission of inquiry , and the commissionhad declared that Bernadette 's visions had been authentic , thep226bishop felt that Father Peyramale was too local and provincial to be the promoter of Lourdes . The bishop appointed four members of the nearby Garaison order , led by Father Serape , to take over Lourdes and the shrine . Whereas Peyramale 's plans were limited to building a basilica above the grotto , Father Sempe envisioned Lourdes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his order who obliterated Peyramale in their rush for bigness . They created , at the edge of Lourdes , the Domain of Our Lady . There they funded the vast esplanades , staged real processions , completed the basilicas . They fought Peyramale to the ground , eventually obliterated his reputation , and in effect made the shrine what it has become today . Is that what you mean by politics ? " Liz Finch could not fault Ruland for lack of frankness . He apparently had covered everything for her , yet had not confessed to any real chicanery and hype . A little , but not much . A bone of contention to nibble at , but nothing to take a real bite out of . Smart man , clever man . " I suppose  --  yes , I suppose that is what I meant by politics . " " Well , there you have it all . " Ruland pushed himself to his feet . " Now I must be on my way , but if there is ever anything else you wish to inquire about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes later , when Liz stood in the morning sunlight before the Palais des Congres , she realized that she had scribbled only three useful lines in her notebook , and those at the very end of the session . She read what she had scribbled : " Bernadette did not believe in the cures at the grotto , and for her own cure she went to the village of Cauterets . Be sure to go to Cauterets and check that out , and ask for Father Cayoux . " She stuffed the notebook into her purse . You 're damn right she was going to Cauterets , in fact this very afternoon . Following the address on the slip given to her by Yvonne , the hotel receptionist , Amanda Spenser at last came upon the Marian Car Rental , a side-street front office with a small automobile lot behind it . Going inside , Amanda found one customer ahead of her , a weird-looking woman with orangish hair , studying a map spread onp227the counter . The clerk , a Frenchman too young to grow a full mustache , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his customer directions to somewhere . The young clerk straightened up . " There you are , Miss Finch . just be certain you get on highway N21 going south . After that you 'll have no trouble . It is not much of a drive , merely thirty kilometers . " " Thank you , " said the customer , accepting car keys from the clerk . " Let me go over the route once more . No , you need n't do it with me . You can attend to the other lady . " The clerk moved sideways , and greeted Amanda questioningly , as she stepped closer to the counter . " Can I help you , madame ? " the clerk inquired . " Yes , you can , " said Amanda , setting the slip in front of him . " The receptionist at my hotel suggested I come here . She thought you might have a car available for rental this afternoon . " The clerk took on a mournful expression . " I am sorry , madame , so sorry . Our last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dammit , " muttered Amanda . This was frustrating . She had spent much of the morning bored to tears at the grotto , while Ken had silently given himself over to prayer before the stupid hole in the hill . After lunch she had decided she could n't do a repeat visit , and had sent Ken off to the domain alone . She had determined to use the afternoon better by resuming her pursuit of Bernadette . She had to prove , the sooner the better , that the peasant girl from Lourdes was more fit to be a patient of a clinical psychologist than to be a saint whose visions could save people . Then , remembering the bit of historical gossip that the taxi driver from Eugenie-les-Bains had given her , Amanda had made up her mind to spend the afternoon driving to the village where Bernadette had actually gone for her cure . And now , no car . " Dammit , " she repeated aloud , " and all I wanted to do was to go to some little town near here called Cauterets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hours if I gave you something extra ? "  | " Madame , in a week like this one , no cars no matter for how much money . " Crestfallen , about to leave , Amanda heard the rustle of another person beside her . It was Miss Orange Hair . The other one was asking her something . " Did I hear you say you wanted to go to Cauterets ? " " That 's right . " " I 'm Liz Finch , the lady who hired the last car , the one you wanted . And I 'm about to drive to Cauterets . " She hesitated . " Are you , by any chance , a member of the press ? " Amanda dismissed the notion with a short laugh . " Press ? Me ? Anything but . I 'm Amanda Clayton , here from Chicago . I 'm visitingLourdes with my husband , who 's hoping for a cure . I wanted to do some  --  some sightseeing in my time off , and I heard that Cauterets is worth a short visit . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finch , " be my guest . I 've got the BMW , and we 're both headed for the same spot , so come along , if you want to . I could stand some company on the road . " Amanda was delighted . " Do you mean it ? That 's very kind of you . I 'll be glad to share your expenses . " " You heard me say be my guest . I have no expenses . I 'm here on an expense account . " She folded her map . " Come on , let 's get the show on the road . " They settled into the slick and clean BMW sedan . The women strapped themselves into their seats , and Liz nimbly took the car through the traffic . About a half mile from the main square , they drove past the Palais des Congres and Les Halles on the Avenue du Marechal Foch , and then swung left and merged into the highwaylabeled N21 and headed south . Liz , who had been concentrating on her directions , now relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thirty kilometers to Cauterets . That 's eighteen miles or so . Should n't take long , except the clerk back there said the last ten kilometers climbs up a canyon and might slow us down . " She glanced at Amanda . " Why 'd you pick Cauteretsas a place to visit ? I 'm told it 's not much . " " We-11  --  " Amanda hesitated briefly . " If you want the truth  --  but first I 'd better find out something . Are you a Catholic ? "  | " I 'm an out-and-out atheist . Why ? " Amanda was relieved . " I wanted to tell you the reason I 'm going to Cauterets , and it would have been difficult to tell a believer . I 'm not a Catholic , either , just a run-of-the-mill convert and by profession a clinical psychologist who does n't believe in miracles . Or in supernatural visions . " Liz grinned . " I think we 're going to have a good trip . " But my husband , Ken Clayton  --  well , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  well , he 's a fallen-off Catholic who suddenlygot religion again . Not that I fully blame him for reaching for something . You see  --  let me explain  --  we were in love , were soon to be married , when it was discovered that Ken had a malignanttumor on the upper thigh . " " Sorry about that , " said Liz . " That 's dreadful . " " He was supposed to undergo surgery . But surgery in that area is iffy stuff . Nevertheless , it was his only hope . Then , in the Chicago papers , he read the story about Bernadette 's secret  --  that the Virgin Mary is returning to Lourdes this week . " " It was probably my story he read , " said Liz . Amanda was surprised . " You 're a reporter ? " " With the Paris Bureau of Amalgamated Press International of New York . I filed The Reappearance Time story that ran in most U.S. papers . Your Ken probably read my story . " " Probably , " agreed Amanda . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What happened to Ken after he read my piece ? " " He got religion , put off the important surgery , and hightailed it here to Lourdes to see if the Virgin Mary could cure him . " " And you came along ? " " To try to bring him to his senses . The longer he puts off surgery , the less chance for survival he has . I 'm trying to convince him he 's wasting his time here . I do n't think the Virgin Mary is coming back , because I do n't think she was here in the first place . " Liz shot her companion a look of delight . " Hey , Amanda , you 're a girl after my own heart . " " That 's why I wanted to go to Cauterets . I want to prove to Ken that Bernadette herself did not believe the grotto could cure.  |p230I  heard a rumor to that effect , that when Bernadette was ill , she did n't pray at the grotto . Instead , she went to Cauterets to take thermal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It is true , I assure you , " interrupted Liz . Amanda sat up . " You know it 's true ? For sure ? " " I can guarantee it 's a fact , as given to me by the best Bernadetteauthority in Lourdes . That 's Father Ruland , a bigwig priest there , close to the bishop of Tarbes and Lourdes , and a sort of an expert on our grotto girl . " She laughed . " Now I can tell you why I am going to Cauterets . You wo n't believe it , but it 's true . I 'm going for the same reason you 're going . To prove Bernadette was a phony . " " Well , I do n't know if she was a deliberate phony . She may have believed she saw all those apparitions . She may have been hallucinating . " " Whatever , what difference ? " Liz sang out . She pointed from the open driver 's window . " It 's a beautiful day out there , and getting more beautiful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a wide river valley , the ripegreen hillsides dotted with chalets . A bit of Switzerland in France , Amanda thought , especially with those snow-capped mountainpeaks , like irregular sentinels rising in the distance . She had noticed that they had passed through a village named Argeles-Gazost , andnow they were entering another village called Pierrefitte-Nestalas . Liz was speaking again , as she maneuvered the BMW throughthe town . " I interviewed Father Ruland in Lourdes this morning , and he 's the one who told me that Bernadette did not believe hergrotto could cure , or at least she had no interest in its curativepowers . When she felt ill , she traveled to the spa in Cauterets totake the thermal baths and hoped to be healed . So it is probably atrue story , coming as it did from Ruland . But still , when you'rewriting an expose you want to be superpositive . I made a telephone call to Cauterets and arranged to interview Father Cayoux , theparish priest there . " She paused . " Yes , I 'm trying to do what youalso want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . A sicky or a liar , one or the other . People have wanted to believeher for so long that nobody 's really looked carefully at the facts.  |p231Everybody  takes her story  --  well , on faith . I want to do a big number out of here , a big blast , and if ever , this is the week to do it . But when you go worldwide like that , you 'd better have the goods . And I hope to find it , some of it or all of it , in Cauterets . " She gave Amanda another grin . " We have the same purpose . Only different motives . So it 's going to be a fun day . Ca n't wait to get there . Oops , we must be in the home stretch , because we 're climb-ing . " A sharp turn out of the village had brought them up a steep road , a winding mountain road , along a precipitous cliff , and past a few miniature waterfalls . Liz was driving at a slower speed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a river  --  the map told them it was the Gave de Cauterets  --  rushed . The valley before them was widening now and they could make out the village of Cauterets , resembling a French resort town , nestled beyond . Soon they were in the town , and passing two thermal-bath buildings identified on their more detailed map as Thermes de Cesar and Neothermes . " There they are , " said Liz , " the places Bernadette considered more useful for her health than the grotto . " Next , they found themselves in the Place Georges Clemenceau , the main square . Over the rooftops and beyond they sighted the spire of the church , Notre-Dame de Cauterets , their destination . Liz indicated the spire . " That 's where we 're headed . " " In the footsteps of Bernadette , " Amanda said almost gayly , tilled with optimism at finding what she wanted to know . They reached a narrow one-way street , Rue de la Raillere , that wound up to the church . At the top , they realized that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a parking lot . They emerged from either side of the BMW , both stretching as they studied the church . The church was encircled by a wrought-iron fence built into dirty-white stone blocks . Liz was reading her watch . " On time , " she said , " actually five or ten minutes early for my appointment with the parish priest . Might as well go in and find him . " They walked in step across the square , which they saw was thep232Place Jean Moulin , noted the statue of a French soldier and the plaque listing the names of the town 's dead in World Wars I and II , and continued on up a steep flight of steps and into the church entrance . Indoors , there was a handful of worshippers , and Mass was coming to an end . They held back , and Amanda surveyed the interior . The altar area ahead , past the pews , was surprisingly bright and modern , circular marble steps leading to a beige-carpeted platformand a cheerful blond-painted square altar . The Mass had ended , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step out to intercept a downy-cheeked youngster , with the look of a choir boy , who had come up the aisle . " We have an appointment with Father Cayoux , " Liz said in French . " Is he around ? " " I believe he is in the presbytery , madame . " " Would you be kind enough to tell him that Miss Finch is here from Lourdes to see him ? " " Gladly , madame . " As the boy hurried off , Liz , followed by Amanda , began to inspect the decorations along the inner walls of the church . Beside a doorway near the altar area , Liz halted to examine a curious old Vierge  --  a fourteen-inch-high statue of the Virgin Mary  --  blue and peeling , set under a glass bell on a wooden ledge . Amanda pointed to the plaque beneath it . " Look at that . " Bending to the plaque , Amanda translated aloud in English . " In the year of our Lord 1858 , between the seventeenth and eighteenthapparition , the little Lourdaise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Cauterets for her health , said her rosary before the statue of this Vierge . " " Well , that confirms it all right , what Father Ruland told me , " said Liz with pleasure . The downy-cheeked boy had reappeared . " Father Cayoux is in the presbytery . He will receive you . I will show the way . " But he did not move , instead pointed his finger to the statue of the Virgin Mary on the ledge . " You are interested in Saint Bernadette 's visit ? " " Very much so , " said Amanda.  | " Here , I will let you see the room dedicated to her . " The boy hurried up some carpeted steps through a doorway , and Amanda and Liz followed him . " Chapelle Sainte Bernadette , " the boy explained . It was a narrow , starkly modern room , with patterned carpeting , maroon-covered armless bench chairs , a few small sculptured holy figures on the plain light-brown walls . " Very nice , but very nothing , " Liz said to Amanda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Take me to your leader . " When the boy looked puzzled , she added , " Let 's see Father Cayoux . " A few minutes later , they entered the presbytery and found the priest on his feet , at a table that served as his desk . He was pouring hot tea into three Limoges cups . Liz went to him , extending her hand and addressing him in French . " I 'm Liz Finch from the American syndicate in Paris . And , Father Cayoux , this is my friend who has accompanied me , Amanda Clayton , also an American visiting Lourdes . Her husband is ill . " Having welcomed them both , Father Cayoux waved them to two of the three straight-backed chairs near his table . As he passed out the cups of tea , and a plate of cookies , Amanda took him in . Father Cayoux was quite fat in his black clerical robe , rotund and short . A fringe of black hair detracted from his partial baldness , and he had a carbuncle of a face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frown he wore was perpetual . Although friendly enough , Father Cayoux gave her the impression of someone who might be irritable and fussy . Setting the plate of cookies on the table , he selected one , and balancing his own cup of tea , he settled with an exhalation in the chair beside Amanda , with Liz next to her . " So , " he said to Amanda , now speaking in English , " you are in Lourdes to see your husband cured . How do you like Lourdes ? " Amanda was at a loss . " I  --  I have n't had time to find out . Well , it is rather unusual . " Father Cayoux snorted . " It is awful . I dislike it . I rarely go there . " He had an abrupt manner , and seeing Liz beaming at him , he addressed her . " On the telephone , Miss Finch , you said that Fatherp234Ruland had told you that the petite Bernadette had gone not to her grotto but came to our thermal baths hoping for her cure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could speak of this interestedme , that you could wonder even for a moment whether our well-known Ruland was being truthful . " " As a newspaperwoman , I had to be  --  " " No , no , I understand , " said Father Cayoux . " And every abbe can not be trusted , to be sure , and you would have a right to wonder about a salesman like Ruland . When you questioned that story of his , I decided to see you . As to Bernadette and her visit here , you will recall I said come here and see for yourself . Now you have seen ? " Liz bobbed her head . " We have seen the Vierge , Father , and the inscription below . " Father Cayoux tasted his tea , then blew on it , and spoke . " In Bernadette 's time our Cauterets was a fashionable spa , with the best of healing springs . You have seen the thermal baths ? " " Yes , " said Amanda . " They are less of an attraction today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a resort of importance . In contrast , Lourdes was a minor impoverished village . But that petite peasant girl changed it all , made the world turn upside down . She made Lourdes an international center , and reduced us to a half-forgotten way station . Actually , her own role in this was innocent , perhaps  --  perhaps . Her promoters saw the opportunity and took advantage . " He blew on his tea once more , sipped , nibbled his cookie thoughtfully . " No , Bernadette did not believe in the curative value of her grotto . She was always ill from the start , touched by a cholera epidemic that had taken others , a pitiful child with secondhand clothes , underfed and weakened by chronic asthma . She could not imagine , I suppose , that she could be healed by her own creation , the holy grotto , so in a period between her last two visions , after suffering a serious and lingering cold , she came here to Cauterets for treatments , to bathe in the water , to pray . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended , she came here a second time still hoping to be healed . " He snorted , placed his empty cup on the table . " The inventor did not believe in her invention . "  | " What do you mean by her invention ' ? " Amanda quickly asked . " Are you being literal , Father ? " " I 'm not sure , " Father Cayoux mused . " I 'm not quite sure , " he repeated , staring into space . " I am a devout priest , a Marianist , perhaps closer to my faith than some of those ringmasters and publicity seekers who wear the cloth in Lourdes . I believe in God , His Son , His Holy Mother , and all the rites of our church , beyond question . I am less certain about miracles . They exist , have happened , I would imagine , but I have yet to see one in my time , and I wonder if Bernadette saw one or any in her time . You see  --  " His voice drifted off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was excited , and a glance told her that Liz was , also . During Father Cayoux 's recital , Amanda had perceived what was responsible for his crustiness and skepticism . He resented Lourdes , the big show , the brassy big time , the success , that overshadowed his parish and caused his good works to be overlooked . He was jealous of Lourdes , and he was angry with its high-riding hierarchy . All because of a little girl 's fancies . His own obscurity , the changed character of his parish , was due to a  --  possibly  --  unbelievable little scamp , and the machinations of a cabal of church promoters . There might be much here , Amanda thought , indeed everythingthat she and Liz wished for , if Father Cayoux could be persuaded to continue . Perhaps , what he had been saying , had been about to say , had frightened him , made him think that he had better cease and desist . But no , Amanda told herself , this was a man who slid not frighten easily . She determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You were saying , Father ? This is all so fascinating . You were wondering about Bernadette and her visions . " Father Cayoux 's head bobbed up and down . " I was thinking about it , the miracles , " he said . His eyes focused on his visitors , and he addressed them directly . " You see , visions and miracles come cheaply to the villages of these Pyrenees valleys , as they do to so many young visionaries in Portugal and in remote parts of Italy . " " Do you mean that others like Bernadette had entertained similar visions ? " asked Amanda . Since Father Cayoux was apparently incapable of laughing , hep236met the question with a familiar snort . " Others like Bernadette ? Countless others like Bernadette before she came along and in the years since . I have heard that between the years 1928 and 1975 there were at least eighty-three persons , in Italy alone , who claimed to have seen the Virgin Mary . You have heard about the incident at La Salette near Grenoble ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Liz . " I have n't , " Amanda told the priest . " La Salette was one of your typical rustic villages , " began Father Cayoux with relish . " On September 19 , 1846 , two children of the village , shepherd children , Melanie Calvet , fifteen , and a boy of eleven , Maximin Girand , saw the Virgin Mary and heard propheticsecrets from Her . The boy was manhandled by the police , but refused to reveal the secrets . Both of the youngsters were interrogated for fifteen consecutive hours , but would not reveal the secrets . Instead , four years later , they sent the secrets that the Blessed Virgin had given them to Pope Pius IX , who did not reveal them . The authenticity of the vision seen by the pair was hotly debated . Melanie was abnormal in some ways , ignorant , and even Catholic apologists admitted that she was lazy and careless . Maximinwas worse , a known liar , but clever and vulgar . Both were characterized as repulsive young people . Nevertheless , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely . After forcing the children out of sight  --  the girl was placed in a convent in England , the boy with the Jesuits  --  the good Fathers promoted the La Salette miracle , put it over , and the pilgrimages began and the community prospered . Sound familiar ? " " Incredible , " said Amanda . " La Salette was before Lourdes . The miracle at Fatima in Portugalcame after . Three shepherd children , Lucia dos Santos , ten , Francisco , nine , and his sister , Jacinta Marto , seven , on May 13 , 1917 , saw the Virgin Mary in a bush and once a month for six months thereafter . As usual , they heard secrets , and there was skepticism among the clergy and the children were even put on trial . But the children and their visions prevailed and Fatima became a miracle shrine second only to Lourdes . "  | " The Fatima youngsters must have known about Bernadette , " said Liz , " as Bernadette probably knew about La Salette . " " Very likely , " agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she must have drawn her scenario , if such it was , from Betharram . " " Betharram ? " said Amanda blankly . " It is a town on the Gave de Pau , not far from Lourdes . It is a place where miracles supposedly occurred for many centuries . The Virgin Mary in white materialized there a number of times . The most dramatic apparition took place when a little girl fell into the river , and was certain to drown . The Virgin Mary appeared on the bank , held out a sturdy branch for the sinking girl to grasp , and she was pulled ashore and saved . Betharram had its own wonder worker in Michael Garacoits , who became Father Superior at the local seminary and was a splendid teacher . He also had the ability to levitate . He died in 1863 , and was canonized as a saint in 1947 . Anyway , it was from Betharram that Bernadette may have fashionedher own Lourdes scenario . " Amanda was intrigued . " How ? " she wanted to know . " Bernadette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there often . The Betharram church acknowledged that Bernadettewas there praying for a number of days , four or five , before she had seen her first apparition . The very rosary Bernadette used at the grotto was the one she had purchased in Betharram . Michael Garacoits was still alive during and after Bernadette 's apparitions . She was sent to see him and he believed her story from the start . When someone told him , ' This Lourdes may overshadow your Betharram , ' Garacoits was alleged to have replied , ' What does it matter , if Our Lady is honored ? ' He visited the grotto many times before his death . " Father Cayoux paused . " Well , the obvious point is that Bernadette could easily have picked up the Virgin Mary apparition idea at Betharram and imported it to Lourdes . " Liz leaned forward . " We appreciate your forthrightness , Father . Many priests might not be as realistic and candid . Clearly , you are a man of faith yet one who holds the Bernadette story suspect . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Cayoux . " Bernadette 's frequent visits to Betharram certainly give rea/son for holding Bernadette suspect , " said Liz . " I wonder if you have any other evidence that might indict Bernadette ? " Father Cayoux backed off slightly . " That might indict her ? No , I have no proven evidence against her or her honesty . Just suspicions , just circumstantial evidence that makes her story question-able . " " Any of this you wish to speak about ? " pressed Liz . " There is too much , far too much , " said Father Cayoux . " For one thing , Bernadette 's parents . Francois and Louise Soubirous are portrayed , in those pretty color booklets they sell you in Lourdes , as impoverished , struggling , but industrious parents , perhaps too generous and charitable . Nonsense . They were both terrible drunks . I do not mean to visit the sins of the parents on the children , but just to show you what an unstable background Bernadette had . Nor did she have a decent home or a decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her father was not fit to make a living . Bernadette was famished most of the time . The food she ate was mostly cornmeal porridge , watered-down vegetable soup , cornmeal and wheat bread sometimes mixed with rye . She often threw up her food . She might have suffered from ergotic poisoning as well . " " Which can make people hallucinate , " interjected Amanda . " It can , " said Father Cayoux . " But even without such poisoning , her stomach was empty and her head was light . All the family starved . Bernadette 's brother was seen scraping candle wax from the church floor for food . Bernadette , unlearned , constantly hungry , constantly ill with asthma , and without dependable love was certainly a candidate for  --  as you suggested , Mrs. Clayton  --  halluci-nations . " " Yet , " said Liz , " Bernadette was so exact in what she saw and what she heard . And this made a favorable impression on most believers . " Father Cayoux nodded . " Well , let 's examine how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard . The Virgin Mary that Bernadette saw was very young , too young , skeptics thought , for a Mother of Christ . As one English skeptic , Edith Saunders , explained  --  " Father Cayoux reached for a folder on his desk , andp239located a sheet of paper inside . He began to read from it . " ' Bernadettelooked into the grotto and saw hard reality . She was despisedand rejected and had no way of making herself admirable . Life had cast her disarmed into its competitive arena . She was fourteen years old , but so small and young-looking that she appeared to be only eleven . . . . The ideal of a little girl is naturally a little girl , and the apparition had the form of a girl of dazzling charm and beauty . She appeared to be about ten years old , and in being even smaller than Bernadette she consolingly proved that one could be very small and yet be perfection itself . ' " To Amanda 's analytical mind , this was all insightful . Bernadettehad been suffering from reactive psychosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had undergone a total flight from reality . In order to escape the problems of living , she had lost herself in imaginary satisfactions that made her existencemore endurable . Father Cayoux deserved praise . " That information , that 's very good , " Amanda told him . " There is more , much more , " Father Cayoux promised . " The Virgin that Bernadette saw was wearing a pure white dress . Well , that 's more or less traditional . And Bernadette herself admitted that the Virgin was dressed much like the Children of Mary , a group of young Catholic women volunteers in the village who were very beloved and were often attired in pure white dresses . " " What about the Immaculate Conception bit ? " Liz interrupted . " The Virgin informing Bernadette that she was the ImmaculateConception , a concept that Bernadette could not have known about . " Father Cayoux uttered one of his characteristic snorts . " Bernadetteknew about the Immaculate Conception , that I guarantee you . She may not have understood the concept , but she knew about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town of Bartres a few months before her visions , she attended or saw the Feast of the I inmaculate Conception celebrated there as a holy day . The Feast of the Immaculate Conception was also a holy day in Lourdes itself . Bernadette certainly absorbed this . "  | " Yet , Bernadette carried it off , presented it all as something new to her , " Liz said . " Possibly with some help , " Father Cayoux added mysteriously . He proceeded to clarify and expand on his remark . " There may have been a degree of stage management . " " Meaning ? " Liz prodded . " While Father Peyramale would not allow his fellow priests to attend Bernadette 's exercises at the grotto , " said Father Cayoux , " he did permit Bernadette to have constant contact with these clergymen in the confessional . These clergymen , in Lourdes and Bartres , were Marians , strongly pro Mary and in favor of the ImmaculateConception dogma , and one of them once pointed to Bernadette , saying , If the Blessed Virgin were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child She would choose . ' Furthermore , her Lourdes confessor constantly advised Bernadette , despite all restrictions , to continue to go to the grotto . In short , there were members of the church pushing for the acceptance of the visions . Nor were Bernadette 's parents as far removed and as innocent of the happeningsas has been made out . Once , when Bernadette came down to the grotto , with a great crowd on hand , perhaps four thousand people , Madame Jacomet overheard Francois , Bernadette 's father , whisper to her , Do n't make any mistake today . Do it well . ' " " Wow , " said Liz . " Is that really true ? " " It was noted firsthand , " Father Cayoux assured her . Amanda , whose mind was on her Ken , went to something else . " But the original cures , like the Troy girl , " she said to the priest , " what about them ? " " Many of the cures were not ascertained , " said Father Cayoux . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twelve years old . She had been blind for nine years . She went to Lourdes , to the grotto , from Luz , and was embraced by Bernadette , and came away with her sight fully restored . Shortly after , her priest in Luz revealedthat Eugenie had never been totally blind , had always been able to see and to work at her job . There had been no cure at all , and besides , the doctors in 1858 were very limited in their knowledge , and unscientific. "  | " But they are scientific today , " Liz challenged him , " and cures supposedly occur . " Amanda turned to Liz . " There is wish fulfillment , self-hypnosis , and there are so many diseases that physicians still do n't know enough about , and many are eventually  --  especially under certain stimuli  --  self-curing . " " Precisely , " agreed Father Cayoux . " There can be cures , but they need not be regarded as miraculous . " With a grunt , he lifted his bulk out of the chair and stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Lourdes had its foothold in fame , there was a problem . The problem was the young Bernadette , who was growingup as a legend . What to do with her ? Continual exposure to the public , long after the visions had ceased , might lead her to contradictions , unvisionary behavior , might erode her legend . The mastersof Lourdes encouraged her to remove herself from the public eye , become a relatively faceless nun . To this end , her masters encouraged her to leave Lourdes forever . She decided to go to Nevers , enter the convent of Saint-Gildard , become a cloistered nun . Before Bernadette was removed to Nevers , an eligible young man , an aristocrat and medical student , who had fallen in love with her , came to Lourdes to propose marriage . Bernadette was never told about that . The young man was rejected by her guardians , and she was spirited out of sight to the convent . " The women had come to their feet . " Might there be anything of interest for us in Nevers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Father Cayoux . " It is true that Bernadette'snovice mistress in Nevers , Mother Vauzou , did not believe in Bernadette 's visions . Mother Vauzou also treated her little nun harshly , almost sadistically , because she considered Bernadette too self-important and vain . However , this may have been Mother Vauzou 's problem and not Bernadette 's . At any rate , that was in the old days . I have no idea how the sisters up there regard Bernadette today , probably highly since she was elevated to sainthood after her death in 1879 . " He was fussing about his tabletop now , obviously eager to return to his duties . " You might go up there and see for yourself . "  | " We just might , " said Liz . " Father , I do n't know how I can thank you enough , for Mrs. Clayton and myself , for the time you 've given us and for the balanced picture you 've given us of Ber-nadette . " " My pleasure , I 've tried my best to help , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you both . " After they had left the presbytery , exiting from the front entrance into the waning afternoon , they paused to light cigarettes and then looked at each other . " Well , what do you think ? " Amanda wanted to know . " What do you think ? " countered Liz . " For me , fascinating stuff , a healthier view of the Lourdes matter , " said Amanda . " Maybe I 'll try to repeat some of it to Ken . Only  --  " " Only what ? " " Only I 'm not perfectly sure about our fat priest friend , " said Amanda . " It crossed my mind that much of his cynicism , backbiting , might have been caused by pique and jealousy of Lourdes , and the way it has outstripped Cauterets as an attraction . " " No doubt about that , " agreed Liz . " Still , it does n't make what he gave us any less true . " " But you have n't told me what you really think , " said Amanda . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what Cayoux told us has some basis in fact  --  it 's mainly a conversation piece , peripheral material , " said Liz . " None of it adds up to an API expose story . I still need some piece of hard central evidence that shows Bernadetteup as a charlatan or an adolescent nut . Unless I have that piece of provable evidence , I ca n't file a story . " " Maybe you 're right , " said Amanda . Liz started down the steps to the Place Jean Moulin and itsI'I parked cars , with Amanda falling in beside her . " Let 's head back to Lourdes before it gets dark , " Liz said . " Once we 're there , I 'll find out how to get to Nevers . I believe it is nearer to Paris than Lourdes . If we want to spend tomorrow there , we may have to leave tonight . You game ? " " Why not ? "  | " We ca n't miss a bet , " said Liz . " Nevers may give us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and show us Bernadette 's big secret . " If there is a secret , " said Amanda . " Are you kidding ? " said Liz . Rarely in his life had Mikel Hurtado felt more frustrated and puzzled than he felt this evening as he once more trudged back to the Hotel Gallia &; Londres . For the third time this day , he had been blocked in his efforts to plant the dynamite and detonator beside the grotto . Retreating slowly to the hotel , Hurtado reviewed his forays and failures and tried to make sense out of them . Early in the afternoon , armed with his shopping bag of explosives , he had confidentlyundertaken his first effort of the day . He had wended his way down the crowded Avenue Bernadette Soubirous to the corner , intent on following the stream of pilgrims crossing the street to the head of the ramp , and going down the ramp into the domain . Stepping off the curb , he had stopped dead in his tracks . Past the pedestrian traffic , across the way , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the white-and-red squad cars with a blue light on its roof . The police were strung out , barring access to the ramp and the domain , observing visitors , apparently halting and questioningsome . Hurtado could not make out clearly what the police were up to , but they were there all right , exactly where he had seen them gathered last night . Realizing that he did not dare go closer , considering the contents of his shopping bag , he had backed off yet again and returned to the hotel . In his hotel room , he had taken a deck of cards from his suitcase and devoted himself to endless games of solitaire . Tiring of this pasteboard masturbation , he had picked up a paperback novel by Kafka , flung himself on the bed , and read until he had dozed off . Awakened by the sound of singing outside the window , the late afternoon procession , he had squinted at his bedside clock . Five-thirty . By now , he had hoped , the police would be done with whatever they were doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shopping hag , and for the second time this day hadp244strolled over to the Boulevard de la Grotte . Across the thoroughfare , the hub of the scene had been a replica of what he had witnessed four hours or so before . There was the milling crowd , vocally annoyed by the slowdown while going into the domain , and the uniformed police apparently examining each worshipper and tourist passing through a temporary barrier at the ramp entrance . Once more , Hurtado knew that he dared not risk it , until he was certain that the police had left . Returning to his hotel room , he had disposed of the shopping bag and , feeling a pang of hunger , he had taken the elevator down to the dining room for dinner . At the table for eight where a place was reserved for him , he had seen that his neighbor and new friend , Natale Rinaldi , was already there , eating , and that the chair next to her was unoccupied . He had taken his place , greeting Natale and the other guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dinner . The guests , along with Natale , had been deeply engaged in discussing some of the more dramatic cures that had occurred in the last ten years at the grotto and baths . Disinterested , Hurtado had not deigned to be drawn into the conversation , but consumed his meal moodily , his mind constantly intent on getting into the domain . Not until the dinner was over , and the others were rising to leave and go to the nightly procession , had Hurtado attempted to speak to Natale . He had offered to escort her to her room , and she had thanked him and accepted . In the elevator , going to the second floor , Natale had asked him what he had done with himself this day . He had invented a lie about hours of shopping to find a suitable gift for his mother in San Sebastian . Leaving the elevator , he had inquiredpolitely how she had spent her day . At the grotto , of course , she had told him , at the grotto , praying . He had seen an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquired if she had run into any trouble getting to the grotto . She had told him she 'd had no trouble and wondered why he had asked . He had told her about the police at the ramp , and the long delay in reaching the domain , and was curious about the sudden gathering of gendarmes . At the door to her room , Natale had remembered that this had been briefly discussed at the beginning of dinner by several of theirp245dinner partners . Yes , there had been some police , and those who had discussed it assumed that the police had been trying to spot veteran pickpockets and prostitutes . While the table speculation had proved nothing , still Hurtado felt it was something , and after seeing Natale into her room , bidding her good-night , and going back to his own quarters next door , he had felt encouraged . Once in his room , he had decided to try again , and felt that he would make it . Certainly by now , by nightfall , the police would have found their petty criminals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a normal pace . Preparing for a third advance on the domain , meaning to take the shopping bag with him , Hurtadohad hesitated about carrying it , had felt unaccountably cautious . He had decided that he would examine the terrain , just to be sure that the path was clear , and once assured that it was clear , he would hasten back for his shopping bag and once more go to the domain and the grotto , and lose himself there , and do his preparatory job . For the third time he had walked to the corner , and for the third time the scene had not changed . He could see the delayed lines of visitors pushing toward the ramp , and the bulwark of uniformedLourdes policemen at the head of the ramp . Dismayed , but unencumbered by his explosives and feeling safer , Hurtado had determined that this time he would have a closer look and see what this was all about . He had strolled into the street to the cafe Le Royale , found a seat and table near the curb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity directly across the street . Pulling at the straw in his drink , he had finally been able to make out somethingof what was going on . The police , he could observe , were stopping only those pilgrims and tourists with packages and shoppingbags , unwrapping the packages and searching the bags , then passing the people through to the ramp . Odd , Hurtado had told himself . What in the devil were they looking for ? One thing for certain , he had been glad he had not attempted to enter the domain with his own shopping bag . Now , still puzzled , he was returning to the hotel . Inside the entrance , calling for the key to 206 from the special key desk , taking it , going into the reception lobby , he becamep246aware of the lone receptionist , the plump French lady known as Yvonne , behind the desk busy as ever with some kind of ledger . The moment he saw her , he knew what to do . She would know what was going on  --  most hotel personnel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gossip  --  and she would tell him . Hurtado detoured from the elevator and strode to the receptiondesk with a cheerful smile . " Hello , Yvonne , " he said to her . She raised her head from the ledger and smiled back . " Good evening , Mr. Hurtado . Why are n't you down at the procession ? " It was a perfect opening , and he took it . " Too hard to get down there . Police at every entrance . What 's going on ? " " Well ... " But she was reluctant to answer . He summoned up his most flirtatious smile . " Aw , come on , Yvonne , you know everything . " " Not quite everything  --  but some things . " " So you 're not going to give a poor pilgrim a break ? " " Well , it 's confidential  --  if it could be strictly between us  --  " " You have my promise on the head of the Virgin . " " Really , Mr. Hurtado  --  " " In fact , in return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink this week . If I do n't keep my word , I 'll owe you two drinks , even three . " She rose and leaned across the counter conspiratorially , and he cooperated by putting his head closer to hers . Dropping her voice , she said , " You wo n't break your word , now ? This is absolutely confidential . I have it from my closest girl friend , Madeleine  --  she , uh , has a special relationship with Inspector Fontaine , who is the head of the Lourdes gendarmerie  --  " " Yes ? " Yvonne whispered , " The police have had a tip that a terrorist may attempt to blow up the grotto , of all things , this week . " Hurtado felt the clutch at his heart . He tried to keep his voice even . " I do n't believe it , " he said . " Nobody would do that , certainly not this week . A tip , you say ? " " It was an anonymous call . The inspector did not tell Madeleinemore . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they search everyone going into the domain for explosives . They are taking it seriously all right . In fact  --  " She lowered her voice even more . " They are now checking the foreigners in every hotel . I  --  I 'm not supposed to tell , but they are right here in the Gallia &; Londres this very minute . The inspector himself and a large contingent of police . They have keys to all rooms , to open the rooms right now unoccupied and inspect what is in them and to examine the possessions of guests who are in their rooms . " Hurtado 's throat was dry . " They 're here , now , the police ? " " They started on the first floor about fifteen minutes ago , and they are working their way up . " Hurtado shook his head . " I ca n't believe it , a police search in Lourdes in a week like this . " Yvonne shrugged . " There always could be some crazy one loose . " " Thanks for the gossip , Yvonne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , something occurred to him . He addressed Yvonne once more . Casually . " By the way , almost forgot to tell you . I have to be out of town for a day or two . A friend 's birthday . But hold my room . I 'll be back to use it . And  --  oh , yes , if the police want to know why 206 is unoccupied  --  you can assure them it 's still occupied . Okay ? " " No problem . " He pivoted toward the elevator , and tried to appear unhurried , but in fact his legs were leaden . The realization of what had probably happened struck him all at once . He had half forgotten Julia 's telephone call from San Sebastian yesterday morning , her call confessing that she 'd told their leader , Augustin Lopez , what he was up to . He remembered defying Augustin on the phone with Julia , and he remembered her warning him that if he insisted on going ahead Augustin would try to stop him . He had insisted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lourdes police and warned them of a possible terrorist act . Hurtado knew that he must reach his room on the second floor before the police did . He must get rid of the explosives . Real danger.  |p248He  felt the warm moisture of perspiration on his brow . He waited for the elevator . Hurtado was inside his room , the door shut behind him , falling against it to control his breath . He had poked his head out of the elevator cautiously , praying that the police were not already there . If the police were there , he had made up his mind to get downstairs , get his car , and make a run for it . He might have a head start before they found the dynamiteand detonator in his room , and before they issued an all-points bulletin for his arrest . But when he had come out of the elevator , and quickly scanned the second floor corridor , he realized that it was empty and he was momentarily safe . Immediately , he had made a dash for his room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , breathing hard , exhaling in gasps , he waited for his body to settle into some degree of normalcy . In these fleeting seconds , he tried to figure out his next move . The first thing to do was to get the explosives and his person out of the room , out of the hotel . But then what ? Another hotel ? A boarding house ? Neither promisedany more refuge . He would go for his rented car , drive out of Lourdes to some neighboring town , Pau maybe , and hole up there . He could safely commute to Lourdes , scout the domain , and soon enough the police , empty-handed , would give up their vigil , determining that the anonymous call had been a crank call . The moment the lawmen let down their guard , he would slip in with his explosives and do the job . Fuck you , Augustin Lopez , he shouted in his head to his betrayer . I said you could n't stop me and you wo n't . But ahead of anything else , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself away from the door , he lifted his suitcase , put it on the bed , and opened it . Then he went for the shopping bag of dynamite , and by maneuvering his sparse effects around , was able to make room to fit in the explosives . He looked around the room to see if he had missed anything , and then remembered his toothbrush , toothpaste , and shaving kit in the bathroom . He scooped them up , stuffed them into the suitcase , and shut it tight.  |p249Not  another second to lose . Lifting the suitcase off the bed , gripping it , he opened the door and glanced up and down the corridor . Empty . Time was still on his side . Relieved , he went out into the corridor , closed the door , and started swiftly toward the elevator . Reaching the gate , hoping that the elevator would be there , he saw that it was not there but in use by somebody else . No choice then but to take the staircase next to it down the two floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stairs , he heard sounds , the tramping of footsteps ascending from below and a voice addressing someone else . The voice spoke in French . He eased himself to the side of the staircase , and peered down into the stairwell . He had the briefest glimpse of blue uniformsone flight below . Trapped though he was , Hurtado did not panic . He had escapedat least a half-dozen similar close calls in Spain during his underground years . There was no time to think . There was only his survival instinct . If there was no exit , and no place to hide his suitcase , there might still be one uncertain refuge . Hastily , he strode back toward his room , but stopped at the door just before his room , the door numbered 205 . He could only hope that she was still inside where he had deposited her after dinner . He could only hope that she had not left to grope her way to the grotto alone once more . His knuckles rapped the wood door panel . No reply . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of movement behind the door . More certainly , he could hear the heavy footsteps off to his left tramping up the steps to the second floor corridor . And then he heard Natale 's voice on the other side . " Who is it ? ' He tried to keep his voice down , yet above a whisper . Pressing against the door he said urgently , " Natale , it 's Mikel  --  Mikel Hurtado . I  --  I need your help . Open the door . " Almost instantly , as the French voices to his left filled the corridor , her door came away . Without another word , he slipped into her bedroom and shut the door , locking it from the inside . He wheeled around and saw her standing a few feet from him , wearingp250no more than a diaphanous low-cut , sleeveless white nightgown . No dark glasses this time . Just her blank , unseeing eyes fixed in his direction . " Mikel , " she said , " it is you ? " " It 's me  --  " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so  --  you sounded like you were in trouble . Are you all right ? " He stepped close to her , gripping her bare arm . " I am in trouble , Natale . The local police have been alerted that there 's a terrorist loose . They 're making a room-by-room search of the hotels . They 're in this one now . They 've just come to this floor . If they find me , a Basque  --  they might take me for a suspect . Wrongly . But I could be in trouble . I had to find someplace to hide . Is there anyplace in this room I can hide ? " " Mikel , " she said helplessly , " I do n't know what 's really in this room . What do you see ? " He 'd forgotten her blindness , and now he used his eyes . The room was four ungiving walls . A closet , like the one he 'd had , too shallow . " Maybe the bathroom , " he said , " the shower . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , it 's the first place they 'll look . " Her face came alive . " I know how you can hide . Do as I say , quickly . Take off all your clothes  --  " " What ? " " Mikel , no matter , I ca n't see you . Undress , fast . I 've undone the bed . Crawl into it . Get beneath the covers and pretend you 're asleep . Put your clothes on a chair  --  " " I brought my suitcase . " " Under the bed . " He grabbed the suitcase and shoved it out of sight . " Are the lights on ? " she asked . " Yes . The chandelier . " " Turn it off . " He turned off the overhead lights . " There 's still a dim lamp the other side of the bed . " " Leave it on . Are you undressing ? " " I will . " He yanked off his corduroy sport jacket . He unbut/toned his shirt and hung it on the nearest chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Awkwardly , he stepped out of his trousers and dropped them on the chair . He stood naked except for his jock shorts and socks . " All right , " he said , " I 'm undressed . " " Now get into bed . Cover yourself . Close your eyes . Be asleep . " He stepped to the bed , had begun to get into it , when he saw her feeling her way along the foot of the bed and around it to the other side . She sat down on the side of the bed . " I 'm getting into bed with you . We 're married . When the police knock , I 'll get up and answer . You 'll be asleep . Leave the rest to me . " She was under the covers beside him , and he could sense her nearness and imagine her body . It would have been erotic , exciting , but he was too tense and worried to allow his mind to be stimulated by it . " I have an acute sense of hearing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're very near . So pretend sleep , and be very still , and do n't stir when they knock . Leave everything to Natale . I used to be an actress , you know . " The suspense was full in his throat , almost gagging him , but he lay there unmoving , playing slumber , and waiting for the knock on the door . Perhaps a minute or two had passed in silence . And then it came . Three sharp knocks on the door . Three more knocks . A male voice speaking French . " Anyone in the room ? If so , open the door . It 's the police . " Natale sat up in the bed . " Yes , I 'm here , " she called out . " I was asleep  --  " " Come , open the door . It is the gendarmes . We just want a few words with each of the guests . Nothing to worry about . " " I 'm coming , " called out Natale , leaving the bed . " One sec-ond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to his chin . He could hear Natale padding around the bed to the door . He could hear the lock turning . He could hear the bedroom door creaking slowly , until a thin shaft of light from the corridor fell across the bottom of the bed.  |p252Through  the slit of one eye , Hurtado had a glimpse of the confrontation . He could see Natale , in her transparent nightgown , in the partially open doorway , and facing her , towering over her in the corridor two police officers . The foremost of the officers , the older one , was speaking to Natale apologetically . " I 'm Inspector Fontaine of the Lourdes Commissariat de police , and I 'm sorry to disturb you like this , madame . But it is a necessity . We have received a warning that there is a terrorist loose in the city , probably armed , and we must treat it seriously . Now , with the assistance of our police colleagues from Pau and Tarbes , we are making an overnight sweep of Lourdes , searching every hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorist , you say ? " " Do n't worry , madame , we have many on the search . There is nothing to fear . You are alone here ? Or are there others in the room ? " " Only my poor husband , so exhausted from a long plane trip to join me in Lourdes that he 's already fallen asleep . But of course , if you must , you can come in and wake him . Are there many of you to search my room ? I ca n't tell . I ca n't  --  I 'm unable to  --  to --  " She had let her helpless voice drift off . In the bed , under the blanket , feigning sleep , Hurtado steeled himself for what might happen next . But he guessed , without being able to look , that Natale had somehow indicated her condition . He listened . Apparently she had , for he heard a second and different male voice , higher pitched , probably the first policeman . " Inspector , I believe the young woman is blind . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm afraid I am . I 've come to Lourdes to seek help from the Virgin . Nevertheless , you can  --  " The inspector 's voice broke in . " Never mind , madame . Forgiveus . " He tried to be jocular . " I 'm sure you 're not our terrorist person . " " Nor is my husband , " Natale said coolly . " Neither of you , I 'm certain , " said the inspector . " Sorry to have awakened you . Just doing our duty . You can go back to sleepp253now . Sorry to have disturbed you . We 'll be moving on to finish the rest of the floor . Good-night , madame . " Hurtado heard them march off , opened his eyes as Natale shut and locked the door . In the semidarkness he watched her navigate around the bed once more and waited as she crawled under the blanket . " How was that ? " she asked proudly . He rolled onto his back , pushing the blanket off his chin . " Bravo , you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never attendeda better performance . " From her pillow , she was smiling . " It was easy . It did n't need much acting . Others are always embarrassed and uneasy when they confront someone who is blind . " She paused . " Are you ? " " Embarrassed and uneasy ? Of course not . " " No , not that  --  I meant , are you the one they are after , Mikel ? Are you some sort of terrorist ? " " I 'm not quite what the word implies . But the police might think so . What I am really  --  " " You need n't tell me. " "  --  is a fighter for the freedom of my homeland , the Basque homeland presently in Spain . " His eyes held on her delicate pale face framed by the spread of her shiny raven hair on the pillow . " Are you afraid of me ? " he asked . " How can I be afraid of someone who saved me from a ra-pist ? " " It was natural to want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " In the same way , I 'd never let anyone hurt you . " " You 're marvelous , Natale . " He lifted himself on an elbow . " I want to thank you once more . " He leaned toward her , to peck a kiss on her cheek , but at that moment her head moved and the kiss found her full soft lips . Quickly , he pulled away . Throwing his part of the blanket aside , he abruptly sat up . " What are you doing , Mikel ? " " I 'd better get dressed and leave you alone . I 'll be on my way . "  | " Mikel  --  " She had reached out , fumbling for his bare arm , holding it . " You ca n't . It 's still too dangerous . Where would you go ? " " I 'm not sure yet , but I 'd better leave you . " " No , " she said , gripping his arm more firmly , " you need n't . You might be stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . I wo n't have you risk it . You can stay here until morning , and then see if it is safe . If it is n't yet , you can stay with me until it is safe . " Hurtado hesitated . " Well ... " " Please . " His hand covered hers . " Well , maybe  --  maybe I could just sleep on the floor . " " Do n't be foolish . You can stay right here in bed with me . " Briefly , Hurtado was bewildered by her invitation and her frankness . It was not the way with women he had known in his country . He said quietly , " Are you sure you can trust me ? " She said simply , " Are you sure I want to trust you ? " She removed her hand from his arm , took the fringe of the blanket and threw it off her . She sat up and then in what seemed a single gesture , lifted her nightgown , drew it over her head and luxurious hair , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , utterly naked , her small but full nippled breasts exposed to him , the fold in her soft stomach , the generous thighs , with only the upper portion of her pubic hair visible . He sat speechless , unable to move . " Mikel , what is it ? Does my blindness inhibit you ? " " God , no  --  " " Because it need not . In love , I do n't have to see . Feeling is enough . " Her arms were outstretched , and he tore off his shorts , came to his knees , and fell into her arms , embracing her . His entire body was shaking as he pressed to her , and she felt it . " You are shivering , Mikel , " she said . " Why ? Because of the police ? " " Because of you , it 's you , " he gasped , holding her tightly , feeling the hardness of her nipples , conscious of his own growing hardness.  |p255Her  mouth was at his ear . " Do n't worry about virginity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly one  --  there were youthful episodes , but child 's play . I 've never made love with a man , a beautiful man . " " I  --  I 'm not anything , " he tried to tell her in a strangled voice . Her fingertips were passing over his face . " For me you are beautiful , what I want . " His hand guided her hand over his features , continued to guide her hand as her fingers touched his neck and the soft hairs of his chest . When his hand released her fingers , her hand continued downward on its own . " You are young and strong and wonderful , " she whispered , her breath catching . Her warm fingers had found his hard erection , and her warm fingers curled around his penis . " You want me , " she whispered breathlessly . " I want you , darling  --  more than anything in the world  --  I want you ... " " Love me , " she whispered , sinking back on the bed and into the pillow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Love me , darling Mikel . " Her knees had come up , and her legs had spread , and he reached to touch the long stretch of sweet pubic hair , to caress the distended clitoris , to find the wetness between her legs . His penis was swollen larger and stiffer than he had ever known it , and he guided it to the moist vulva , and easily slid into it deeply , groaning as he did so , and hearing her short cries and gasps as his hardness rose and sank within her . Her hands had been clutching his shoulders , but now her arms clamped around his back , and she was squeezing her fleshy thighs against the friction of the perpetual motion of his body , until she lifted her legs higher and entwined them around his back . They were together now , as one , in perfect unison , rising and falling , she all liquidity below , he perspiring and panting . He had known many women intimately , enjoyed the couplings , the physical stimulation and excitement and release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been only one half of lovemaking , physical , nothing more , but what he was experiencing with this young woman was total lovemaking . There had been no easing in their coupling , only a risingp256crescendo , she heaving her hips uncontrollably , rolling her buttocks , pushing and pulling him , and he in and out , almost peaking , both peaking , near bursting . Then bursting . With outcries and sighs and utter relief . Holding and kissing and loving , each closer than they had ever been to another opposite human being . Long minutes after , drained , lying on the bed separately but together , hands touching , exchanging endearments , Mikel realized that his Natale was silent . He looked closely , and saw that she had fallen deeply asleep in her own special darkness , asleep with a smile on her lips . Smiling down at her , tenderly , he drew the blanket up over her shoulder . At last , he lay back to be with himself . He had not known such a period of peace in years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was left in him , pervading his entire being , merely the residueof love he had felt for this young woman . Gradually , in his drowsiness , he sought the purpose of being in this bed in this town of Lourdes . Reality , the larger reality , slowly surfaced . It was not easy to superimpose reality on , even obliterate briefly , the love that he felt . It was difficult to bring harsh hatred and his reason for being here back to his consciousness . But images of his Basque childhood and adolescence , his father 's murder , the masters of his slavery , evoked anger and hatred once more . With regret , he considered the child woman he adored in slumber beside him . What he was feeling contradicted all that he felt for her . She , this dear one , was a person of unblemished faith in a fairy story that she fervently believed could restore her to normality and living . He , by necessity , remained an enemy of that faith that was now misleading his people into compliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his people , he must destroy the symbol of faith that might lead to their deception and endless thralldom . By his act of destruction , he would also destroy forever Natale 's foolish hope and her love . But , he saw , it must be done . He owed himself  --  and the loss he must endure  --  to an even greater love.  |p257Oh  , Natale , Natale , when it is over and I have succeeded , try to understand . But , he knew , she would never understand . At the same time , it suddenly occurred to him , considering that he had been forced into hiding , that he might never succeed . The police were everywhere , and might continue to be everywhere until the eight days had ended . How could he blow up the grotto if he did not have the means of bringing the explosives into the domain ? Then , an idea , an inspiration came , a means , something he could do tomorrow . If it worked , he might succeed , and turn away the Virgin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Michelle Demaillot , of the Sanctuaries Press Bureau , was briskly leading the way across the Rosary Esplanade of the domain to the Medical Bureau . Following her were the town 's latest arrivals , Dr. Paul Kleinberg , and his dependable nurse , Esther Levinson . It was Kleinberg 's first real view of any portion of Lourdes in the daylight . Despite the sight of so much religious statuary , the number of invalids in wheelchairs and stretchers , and his misgivings about the shrine , he had to admit that the parade ground , or whateverit was supposed to be , offered up an aura of pastoral peace and serenity on this sunny summer 's day . Dr. Kleinberg and his nurse had caught the last Air Inter flight from Paris late yesterday , and when they had left the plane at the Lourdes airport it had already been nightfall . The press lady , withp259her car , had been waiting . During the short drive to their accommodations , Kleinberg , who had come straight from his Paris office to Orly Airport to this Pyrenees village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car window as they had passed through Lourdes . At the Hotel Astoria , in the Rue de la Grotte , ordinary single rooms had been reserved for them . After telephoning his wife , Alice , in Neuilly , to tell her and the boys that he had arrived safely and to let her have the number where he might be reached , he had gone straight to bed and slept without a break for nine hours . Now , as they walked , Kleinberg noticed how rigid and aloof his nurse was . Knowing her , the orphaned daughter of German parents gassed and cremated in the Nazi holocaust , he knew how uncomfortable she was when confronted by any sort of fanaticism , political or religious . Kleinberg felt no similar discomfort in these surroundings . His parents had moved from Vienna to Paris long before the rise of Hitler , and had become naturalized French citizens . He himself had been born a Frenchman , and despite a persistentdegree of muted anti-Semitism among a minority in France , Kleinberg felt that he belonged and was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was broad , although his acquaintance with the Catholic shrine at Lourdes was limited . He had read about Bernadette and the apparitions and the grotto from time to time in newspapers and magazines , and also had read with mild interest about the occasional cures attributed to Lourdes . Besides such casual reading , Kleinberg 's only knowledge of the holy town had come from his careful perusal of three books involving Dr. Alexis Carrel  --  one of the books was about Carrel , two written by him  --  each going into the great physician 's one visit to Lourdes in 1903 . Kleinberg had acquired and read the Carrel books after he had been invited to join the International Medical Committee of Lourdes , which was assembling in Paris to review and ascertain the so-called miraculous cure of an Englishwoman , Mrs. Edith Moore , suffering from a sarcoma . Kleinberg had been unable to assist the committee because of a previously scheduled medical meeting in London , but upon his return to Paris the Lourdes people had contacted him again . Thep260members of the International Medical Committee had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but had withheld their final approval until they could have the vote of a specialist in sarcoma . Kleinberg was one of the two foremost specialists in France treating malignant growths . The other , Dr. Maurice Duval , whom Kleinberg knew and respected , had been too involved in experimental researches to cooperate . So there was only Kleinberg to bring in as a final consultant , and he had been reluctant to become involved in anything of a religious nature . Yet , learning that Dr. Alexis Carrel had once visited and investigated Lourdes , Kleinberg had given the matter some second thoughts . As a student at the Cochin School of Medicine , attached to the Universityof Paris , Kleinberg had admired the writings and career of Dr. Carrel . Kleinberg recalled that the scientist had kept an open mind about Lourdes and spent some time there . Kleinberg reread Dr. Carrel , and verified his student recollections . The great Carrel had , indeed , treated Lourdes seriously . So Paul Kleinberg had agreed to accept the invitation of the International Committee , and go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moore . " Here we are , " he heard Mademoiselle Demaillot announce . Where were they ? Kleinberg stopped , and looked about to orient himself . They were on a sidewalk on the opposite side of the Rosary Esplanade . They were at the double doors of the entrance to a building made up of rugged large stone blocks . Above the entry , white lettering on a blue sign , were the words : MEDICAL BUREAU/SECRETARIAT . " Let me take you inside , " the press lady was saying . " I 'll introduce you to the bureau head , Dr. Berryer , then leave you with him . " Kleinberg and Esther followed Mademoiselle Demaillot insideand found themselves in a spacious ' anteroom , with two office doors on the right . The press lady gestured off to the second door . " Let me tell Dr. Berryer 's secretary you 've arrived . " After the press lady had disappeared into the office , Kleinberg and Esther took their bearings . The walls of the anteroom were decorated with what resembled the artifacts of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer look at the artifacts , and immediately occupied the corner of a sofa , sitting tight-lipped , eyes on the floor . But Kleinberg was more interested . He began to go around the anteroom , studying the displays . The large display on the nearest wall was a framed , glass case and bore the name DE RUDDER at the top . Closer inspection of the glass case revealed two copper casts of a man 's leg bones , one showing the tibia seriously broken , the other showing it fully healed . Kleinberg read the explanatory legend . Pierre de Rudder , of Jabbeke , Belgium , had fallen from a tree in 1867 , and in the fall had broken the tibia in his lower left leg . The bone had a **25;12868;TOOLONG or gap at the fracture point , and would not heal . For eight years , de Rudder had been a cripple . Then , after a visit to a replica of the Lourdes grotto in Belgium , de Rudder had been instantly and miraculously cured , his sundered bone totally put together again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors had performed an autopsy on de Rudder . They had found that the three-centimeter gap had , indeed , closed . " The broken bone edges fitted closely . The bone preserves a very obvious mark of the fracture , but without any foreshortening . " De Rudder had been declared Lourdes ' eighth official miracle cure in 19o8 . Kleinberg wrinkled his nose , and saw his unconscious reaction reflected in the glass of the case , and assessed that his reaction was more of surprise than of doubt . Since their escort had not yet reappeared , Kleinberg continued to wander around the anteroom , studying the framed photographson the three walls , and the printed histories of most of the officially recognized miraculous cures of invalids who had sought help from the Lourdes shrine . The earliest was dated 1858 . The last one framed and hung was a picture of Serge Perrin , who had suffered " recurring organic hemiphlegia , with ocular lesions , due to cerebral circulatory defects . " He had been miraculously and fully cured at the age of forty-one in 1970 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew there had been more cures since then , but perhaps the Medical Bureau had not yet had time to mount them . Kleinberg heard his name called , and wheeled around.  |p262The  press lady was advancing toward him . " Dr. Kleinberg , it appears that Dr. Berryer will be a little late for your appointment . There is a message , and I contacted him by phone at his meeting , and he promises he will be here in ten or fifteen minutes , and offers his apologies . " " No matter , " said Kleinberg . " Maybe you 'd prefer to wait in his private office ? I 'll show Madame Levinson to the examination and X-ray rooms , where you 'll find her after your interview . Then I must leave you both . " " Thank you , Mademoiselle Demaillot . " He allowed her to show him into Dr. Berryer 's office , and watched her leave . Once he was alone , he set down his medical bag , and again tried to get his bearings . It surprised him to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No more than eight feet by eight feet , with a desk and chair in the middle , two chairs for visitors , a crammed bookcase . All neat , no disarray . Kleinberg noticed a mirror , and planted himself before it to see if he was presentable . He frowned at the brown receding hairline , at the smallish hooked nose made more prominent by the sunken cheeks . The bags under his eyes had been earned , and were all right , and his sharp chin was still one chin at forty-one . He straightened his knit tie , squared his narrow shoulders , and decided that he was as presentable as he would ever be . He took a chair to await his tardy host , and realized a feeling of unease , which he had not felt outdoors . It was the displays in the anteroom that had thrown him off a trifle , all those miracles , all so unscientific and alien to his nature . He wondered how one like Dr. Alexis Carrel had coped with it . Dr. Carrel had been severely criticized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious center that claimed miracles and for having confessed that he might have actually witnessed a miracle himself . Carrel 's colleagues in science  --  persons who had once respected him as a member of the faculty of medicine at Lyons University  --  turned against him for having given credence to Lourdes by visiting it and by having given serious consideration to the inexplicable cures that were going on there . Carrel 's colleagues condemned him as " a credulous pietist. "  |p263Dr  . Carrel had defended his interest in the so-called miracles in the press : " These extraordinary phenomena are of great biological , as well as religious , interest . I consider , therefore , that any campaign against the miracles of Lourdes is unjustified and opposed to the progress of medical science in one of its most important aspects . " Actually , rereading the controversy so many years later , Kleinbergcould see that Carrel had been uncertain about the cures at Lourdes and had incurred the anger of the clerical community just as he had provoked the scientific community . For one thing , Carrel had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rosary on the examining table , but no medical tools . " Carrel had been equally unhappy about one of Dr. Berryer 's predecessors , Dr. Boissarie , who had published best sellers about his medical study of the cures . " He has written these works as if he were a priest rather than a physician , " Carrel had complained . " He has indulged in pious consideration rather than scientific observations . He has shunned rigorous analyses and precise deductions . " But the sudden  --  miraculous ?  --  cure of a French girl , Marie Bailly , swept most of his reservations aside . He had tried to defend what he had witnessed before the scientific community : " At the risk of shocking both believers and non-believers , we shall not discuss the question of belief . Rather , we shall say that it makes little difference whether Bernadette was a case of hysteria , a myth , or a madwoman . . . . The only thing that matters is to look at the facts ; they can be investigated scientifically ; they exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Science , of course , must he continually on guard against charlatanism and credulousness . But it is also the duty of science not to reject things simply because they appear extraordinary or because science is powerless to explainthem . " This from the man who had become a giant at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research , who had won the Nobel Prize in 1912 for suturing blood vessels , who had experimented in 1935 with an artificial heart designed by Charles Lindbergh . Sitting there in the stillness of Dr. Berryer 's office in the MedicalBureau , Kleinherg closed his eyes . Do not reject things simplyp264because they appear extraordinary . Dr. Carrel 's own words . At once , Kleinberg felt more relaxed , less disturbed about the miracles heraldedin the anteroom and by his very presence in the playground of the Virgin Mary and the site where he was to reaffirm the miraculous cure of a woman named Edith Moore . Kleinberg heard the office doorknob turn , and came to his feet as a preoccupied , squarish older man barged into the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handclasp . " I 'm Dr. Berryer , and pleased to meet you . Forgive the delay , but bureaucraticmatters can often take more of one 's time than medicine . " " No need to apologize , " said Dr. Kleinberg affably . " I 'm delighted to be here . " " Do sit down , " said Dr. Berryer , going around his desk and standing over it to review the various messages waiting for him . Kleinberg sat down again , and waited as the head of the MedicalBureau swept his messages into a corner , and settled into his swivel chair . " So glad you could make it , " said Dr. Berryer , " knowing how busy you must be . " " I repeat , I 'm delighted . " " Is this your first visit to Lourdes ? " " I 'm afraid so . " " Well , the Moore examination today should n't take up much of your time . You 'll be able to have a look around . Do you know anything about Lourdes ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kleinberg . " I 've seen a few articles on it . Of course , I read the International Committee'ssummary report on Mrs. Moore . And I 've read Dr. Alexis Carrel 's memoir on his visit here . " " Ah , poor Carrel , " said Dr. Berryer with a forced smile . " For the rest of his life , after leaving here , he waffled between belief and disbelief at what he had seen . " " Understandable , for a man of science . " " I , for one , have never had trouble reconciling religion and science , " said Dr. Berryer . " Pasteur had no problem about that . Neither did Einstein . At any rate  --  " He had folded one hand across the other on top of his desk . "  --  since there is a little timep265before Mrs. Moore arrives and you are occupied with her , perhaps I can bore you with a brief fill-in on how we work here  --  medically ... that is , scientifically  --  so that you will feel more at home . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Let me give you a bit of background on the process you are specifically involved in , the process of ascertaining cures , " said Dr. Berryer . " You are acquainted with this process ? " " Only vaguely , " said Kleinberg . " It would be interesting to know more . " " Very well . Briefly then . To give you a better understanding of why we summoned you in the case of Edith Moore and her sudden cure . " " Her miracle cure , " said Kleinberg , with a friendly curl of his lips . Dr. Berryer 's eyes , almost sunk behind the puffy cheeks , fixed on his visitor . His tone became less conversational , more pedagogical . " I am not here to define a cure in Lourdes as miraculous . As a doctor , I can merely define such a cure as unusual . It is for the Church to decide if any cure is related to a divine intervention , one that can be recognized as a sign of God . Our doctors affirm that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our clergymen confirm it can be explained as the work of God . In the Medical Bureau , those are the ground rules . " " I understand . " " The Church has always been less generous than our doctors in its claims . From the time of Bernadette to this day , the Church has claimed less than seventy cures to have been genuinely miraculous . But our doctors , even after rigorous examinations , have been more generous in announcing unusual cures . There have been about five thousand confirmed cures to date . About sixty times more cures than miracles . Why all have not qualified as miracles I can not say . The clergy has its own standards . While millions and millions of visitors have come to Lourdes since 1858 , most have been pilgrims seeking spiritual comfort or tourists wishing to satisfy their curiosity . The number of actual invalids who arrive each year represents a small minority . The statistics break down as follows  --  about one medical cure for every five hundred patients who arrivep266here , and about one miracle for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kleinberg realized that Dr. Berryer 's voice had flattenedout , lost its inflections , settled into a lecture given many times over . " Now as to the criteria governing a cure , " Dr. Berryer went on . " The illness must be serious , inevitable , incurable . The illness must also be organic , not functional . An organic illness involves a lesion at the organic level , whereas a functional illness  --  " Mildly annoyed , Dr. Kleinberg interrupted . He was being treated to a layman 's lecture , and not as a medical colleague . " I am acquainted with your criteria , doctor , " he broke in . Momentarily thrown off his verbal rut , Dr. Berryer stammered slightly . " A , yes  --  yes , of course  --  well , now  --  Mrs. Moore 's hip sarcoma  --  an organic illness , certainly , and a permanent cure . The last hip sarcoma cure we had , before Mrs. Moore 's , dates back to 1963 . I have no doubt  --  and certainly as a specialist in this area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be less unusual in the future , as medicine progresses . " Kleinberg nodded . " Great advances are being made already . Dr. Duval in Paris has conducted successful experiments on animals to arrest and cure sarcoma medically . " " Exactly , Dr. Kleinberg . At one time , medicine could not deal with tuberculosis . But today , there are medical means to treat tuberculosis , and so that is one serious illness which depends less on the grotto . But in the present state of science , many sufferers continue to look to the grotto , to prayers , the water , as a means of recovery . Edith Moore , afflicted by hip sarcoma , was such a one . " He paused . " You know how she was cured by a visit to the baths during her second visit here ? You know her instantaneous cure was confirmed by sixteen physicians , both in London and in Lourdes . " " I do . " " Now as to the process that followed . First , the Medical Bureauhere . In the beginning there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assisted by Professor Vergez of Montpellier , to sift all claims of cures . There were twelve cases considered , and seven of these were determined by Bishop Laurence 's canonical commis/sion in 1862 to be cures that could be attributed to the work of God . The word miracle was not then in use for such cases . After that , as visitors to Lourdes increased , as more patients claimed cures , something had to be done . Dr. Saint-Maclou , who had settledhere , established a reception center for visiting doctors to inspect evidence of cures . That was in 1874 and the center was called the Office of Medical Verifications . Gradually , the VerificationsOffice was enlarged to the present-day Medical Bureau . Shortly after 1947 , the National Medical Committee was establishedand in 1954 this became the International Medical Committee , the one you were invited to sit in on earlier this year . " " And the International Medical Committee has the last word ? " " Medically speaking , yes . The process goes as follows  --  our Medical Bureau in Lourdes confirms a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International Committee . There are about thirty members on the committee , physicians from ten different countries , all appointed by the bishop of Tarbes and Lourdes , and they meet for one day a year , as they recently did . During the most recent meeting , the dossier of Edith Moore was presented . The member doctors discussed it at length . A vote was taken , with a two-thirds vote usually enough for approval . After that , the dossier was returned to the bishop of Tarbes and Lourdes . Since Mrs. Moore 's diocese was in London , the approved dossier was sent to the bishop of London . He , in turn , appointed a canonical commission to judge if Mrs. Moore 's cure was miraculous . As you know , Mrs. Moore 's cure was approved by all hands  --  " " Yes . " "  --  but it was not officially announced because the InternationalCommittee did not have a sarcoma specialist at their meeting . You were invited , but you were away . Dr. Duval was invited , but he was occupied with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your confirming its judgment . Rather than convene the committee again , it was agreed that if you came to Lourdes and saw Mrs. Moore in person , then the official announcement could he made . " " Well , here I am , ready , willing , and able , " said Kleinberg.  |p268Dr  . Berryer considered the white digital clock on his desk . " I made an appointment for Edith Moore to meet with you . She should be in the examining room in about a half hour . " He stood up . " I know you 've studied the report on the case , but that was a summary , and you may prefer to see the diagnosis of each doctor involved . " " That would be useful , " said Kleinberg , rising while Dr. Berryerwent to the bookcase and removed a handful of manila file folders . " I 'll take you to the examining room , and leave these with you . You 'll have time enough to browse through them before your patient arrives . " Kleinberg followed Dr. Berryer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undecorated room , between the leather examiningtable and a wooden cabinet against the wall containing medical instruments , Esther Levinson sat in a chair , leafing through a French magazine . As they entered , she came to her feet , and Kleinberg introduced his nurse to the head of the Medical Bureau . Inside the door , Dr. Berryer handed the layer of folders over to Kleinberg . " For your reading pleasure , " he said . " When you 've confirmed the reports , please let me know . " " I certainly will . " Dr. Berryer had his hand on the knob of the open door , about to leave , when he hesitated and turned back . He stared at the folders in Kleinberg 's hand and then fixed his gaze on Kleinberg himself . Dr. Berryer gave a short cough . " You understand the importance of this case , doctor . Father Ruland , who represents the bishop and the Vatican itself here in Lourdes , thinks it would be of great value to be able to make the announcement of Mrs. Moore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed miracle  --  a lovely present to welcome the return of the Blessed Virgin . So  --  " He hesitated once more . " Uh , I trust you will judge the reports in your hand  --  rather open and shut , I would say  --  entirely on their scientific merit . " Kleinberg 's eyebrows went up . " But how else would I possiblyjudge them ? "  |p269Without  blinking , Dr. Berryer said , " Well , whatever we say , we are dealing with what my church agrees is a miracle cure . And  --  I do know that people of your persuasion do n't have much belief in miracles . Anyway , I am sure you will adhere to the facts . " With that , he left the room , closing the door between them . Dr. Kleinberg 's face had darkened as he glowered at the door . " People of your persuasion , " he mimicked . " Did you hear that , Esther ? " He turned around to see Esther 's features flushed . " I heard , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your persuasion , a man named Moses , was involved in a few miraIles . " Never mind . Who gives a damn about a narrow-minded country lout like Berryer ? Let 's look over these reports , see our Mrs. Moore , and get out of here as soon as we can . " Then , minutes later , as an afterthought , Kleinberg tried to forgive Berryer slightly , remembering that Dr. Alexis Carrel , while not a bigot , had been an Aryan-lover and a race supremacist as well . An hour and a half had passed , and Dr. Paul Kleinberg was still seated in the examining room alone , once more studying the before-and-after medical reports on Edith Moore 's malignant tumor while she was finishing her new work-up and X rays next door . Fascinated , Kleinberg studied the diagnostic reports on Mrs. Moore 's osteosarcoma of the left ilium . It was all there in the seemingly countless microphotographs , the blood tests , the biopsies , the X rays . There was the destructive sarcoma  --  and then it was n't there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reconstruction of the bone elements . Definitely amazing . In his years of practice , Kleinberg had never seen a self-cure such as this one . Absolutely miraculous  --  even to a person of his persuasion . He laid aside the evidence , pleased for the nice , dull English lady . Well , there was nothing left , except for the latest examination and a final new set of X rays and then he would be done . He would he able to confirm to Dr. Berryer and the clergyman called Fatherp270Ruland that God was on their side , after all , and that they could announce their miracle with fanfare to the entire world . With that publicity , and the presumed return of the Virgin Mary to Lourdes , they would have not five million faithful pouring into Lourdes next year , but six or seven million , at least . The door opened , and Kleinberg came to his feet as Mrs. Moore entered , pushing her belt through a last loop on the waistbandof her skirt and fastening the buckle . " All done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kleinberg , not knowing what else to say to a miracle recipient . " I 'm pleased it 's over with , " she said with a happy heave and a sigh . Her bland countenance had color in it and she was definitely repressing considerable inner emotion . " Miss Levinson told me to tell you she 'll have all the X rays for you in five or ten minutes . " " Good . I 'll just have a look , and then I 'll inform Dr. Berryer and prepare my final report . You need n't wait around any longer . I 'm sure the Medical Bureau will be in immediate touch with you . Thank you , Mrs. Moore , for enduring all this discomfort one last time . " She took her summer jacket off a wall hanger . " My pleasure , believe me . I appreciate everything . Good-bye , Dr. Kleinberg . " Esther Levinson arrived with the fresh X rays , turned on the lights in the view box on the wall and pinned up the four X rays for his scrutiny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the negatives , while Esther hovered nearby awaiting his approval . " Umm , this one , " Kleinberg said pointing to the third negative , " it 's a bad shot , unclear , somewhat blurred . She must have moved . " " She did not move at all , " Esther countered . " She 's very professional . She 's been through a million X rays . Mrs. Moore was in position , perfectly rigid . " " Well , I do n't know  --  " Kleinberg murmured . " Tell you what . Remove all of the negatives except this poor one . Pin up two of the other X rays , the previous ones , taken of this area of the iliac bone after her cure . You 'll find them in the dated folders . " As his nurse went to rummage through the folders , Kleinberg continued to inspect the new X rays . Presently , Esther was besidep271him , taking down three of the negatives and replacing them with previous shots for comparative purposes . When she had finished , and stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He studied them in silence , cluckinghis tongue several times . Straightening his back at last , he said , " I 'm sure it 's all right , but I 'd still like to get a better picture from this particular angle . Maybe I 'm being too much of a perfectionist , but when you 're dealing with a so-called miracle , you want to see the results of the miracle one final time . " " We can shoot her again , if that 's what you wish . " Kleinberg nodded . " That 's what I wish , Esther . Just to do it right . We 'll get a better picture , and then we can honestly crown our patient as a miracle woman . Tell you what . Go and see Berryer'ssecretary . She 'll know where to locate our patient . Have her call Mrs. Moore and bring her back for another X ray at two o'clock . Will you do that ? " " On my way , " said Esther . " I 'll meet you in the anteroom in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town , and I 'll treat you to lunch . Then we 'll come back and finish with Mrs. Moore and head for Paris . How 's that ? " " That 's great , " said Esther with a rare smile . Mikel Hurtado awakened with a start . Something had brushed his cheek , touched his lips , and startled him out of a deep sleep . When he opened his eyes , he saw that it was Natale kneeling over him , kissing him a third time . Reaching for her , to bring her closer , he saw that she instinctivelyknew that he would do so , and had pulled away . She retreated to her side of the bed , feeling her way to the far edge , groping for her dark glasses on the bedside table . When she found the glasses , and had slipped them on , she swung off the bed and stood up . " Are you up , Mikel ? " she called . " You bet I 'm up . " " I just wanted to be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . He was sitting now , staring at her . She presented an incongru/ous sight . She was totally nude from her head to her knees  --  the rest hidden by the bed  --  her firm , unblemished being seemed to glow . And she was wearing sun-glasses . " I love you , too , " he said softly . She was groping and finding a fresh brassiere and panty briefs on the chair . " You are the most marvelous lover on earth , " she said . " How would you know ? " he asked chidingly . " I just know , " she replied . " I know how I enjoyed you . I know when I 'm happy . " The sight of her jiggling breasts and brown nipples , the navel in her flat belly , the triangle of pubic hair between the generous thighs , was beginning to arouse him . " Natale , come back to bed . " " Oh , I want to my darling , but I ca n't , not yet . Later , but not now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ? " " Mikel , I 've got to bathe and dress and go to the grotto to pray . What time is it ? " He picked up his watch . " Just past ten-thirty , morning . " " I 'll have to hurry . Rosa takes me to the grotto at elevenfifteenevery day . " " Rosa ? " " She 's that friend of my family in Rome who comes to Lourdesevery summer as a handmaid . She 's been taking care of me . " That instant , Hurtado remembered what had last been on his mind before falling asleep . First things first . He , too , had a priority and an idea of how to pull it off . " I 'll take you to the grotto , " he said . " Let 's go together . " " I 'd like to but  --  Mikel , what about the police ? Maybe you should stay away from them or go out of town . " " The police , " he said . " They 're mistaken . I should tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her the truth , that he was here to destroy what meant so much to her . Yet , he rationalized , she did n't need the grotto to achieve her hopes . She had faith . That was enough . Nor need she ever know his role in what was soon to happen . He was prepared to make up some fanciful story for her ,  |p273a  mistake in identity , a false lead from an enemy , something . " Let me explain  --  " " You do n't have to explain anything to me , " she said firmly . " I told you that before . I do n't need it . I trust you . You still want to take me to the grotto ? You think it 's safe ? " " Of course it is . Yesterday I did n't want to be questioned in my room . But it 's safe now . " And he believed it was . He was positive that whatever Lopez had done , he had not given the Lourdes police a description of the terrorist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get him caught . " Then we 'll go . We can leave Rosa a note on the door  --  " " I can write it for you . " " Yes . Write , Dear Rosa , a friend has taken me to the grotto . You can find me there . Natale . ' Now I 'd better have my bath and dress . " He watched her making her way to the bathroom . First things first , he reminded himself . " Natale , is there anything else I can do for you ? I see your flight bag , your carry-on , sitting on the table . There are some plastic bottles and a candle in front of it . Are they going to the grotto ? " She was at the bathroom door . " Yes , I meant to pack them in the flight bag . I want to light my candle . And fill the bottles with water to take back to my relatives . " His heart skipped . " I 'd be glad to pack them . " " Would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosa , and pack your flight bag . Have I got it all ? " " And love me , " she said lightly , and she closed herself in the bathroom . Tempted as he was to go after her , carry her back to the bed , love her as he had never loved anyone before , he restrained himself . After he heard the tub water running , he crawled out of bed . He scribbled the note to leave behind for the woman named Rosa . He knelt , pulled his suitcase out from under the bed , and unlocked it . Tenderly , he lifted the packages containing the sticks of dynamite , detonator , timepiece , wiring and carried them to the table . Asp274he had planned  --  rather hoped was possible  --  he laid his wrapped explosives inside Natale 's flight bag . Then , he stuffed in a folded shopping bag , and he covered his packages with her large candle and plastic bottles . He drew the zipper on the flight bag . He was waiting , smoking , when she emerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her on the way to the closet , to embrace and kiss her fervently . " Oh , Mikel , I want you so , " she breathed , but drew away . " Later . After . I 'd better get dressed . " " Later , " he agreed . " I 'd better get ready , too . " He sought his travel kit in the suitcase and brought it into the bathroom . After brushing his teeth , he shaved , then quickly bathed , dried himself , combed his hair , and dressed . " Ready , Mikel ? " he heard her call . " Be right with you . " In seconds he emerged , and saw her fumbling at the table . He snatched up the packed bag before she reached it . " I have your bag , " he said . " And I have the note for Rosa . " With his free hand , he took her arm . " Now , to the grotto , " he said . Ten minutes later , as they neared the ramp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The police had their cordon across the top of the ramp , again , and they were stopping only the pilgrims and tourists carrying anything , and were searching through each package or bag before passing the visitors through . Crossing the street , Hurtado said to Natale , " We 'll have to get in line here and go through a police inspection . " " Will it be all right ? " Natale whispered . " No problem , " he said . He hoped . They were inching ahead , and getting close to two of the policemen . This was the moment to make his move as he had planned it . He took Natale 's arm once more . " Querida , do you mind if I leave you for a few seconds ? I forgot my cigarettes  --  and even if they do n't like smoking down there  --  I 'd feel better to have a packp275handy . Here , you take your bag for the moment . I 'll run across the street to the cafe . Catch up with you along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've got just ten steps to take before you reach the police . " " All right , Mikel , " she said , grasping the handle of the flight bag . Quickly , he stepped away from her , and retreated to the back of the line of visitors , making sure to fall in where he had a full view of the police inspection . If something went wrong , he was n't certain what he 'd be able to do for her . But he felt nothing would go wrong . Police , like most authorities , had a weakness for a number of human afflictions . He craned his neck to keep Natale in view , and then he saw her standing with the bag before two uniformed policemen . He saw her hand groping in front of her , trying to find out if she had arrived at the police guards . He saw the two policemen observing her , looking down at her bag , then up at her face . He saw one policeman make a gesture toward his eyes , plainly indicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nod understandingly , and put his hand on Natale 's shoulder , sending her on her way down the ramp uninspected . Hurtado exhaled , and breathed easily once more . In a few minutes , he was before the officers , empty-handed . They glanced at him , and one waved him through . Despite the pebble in his shoe , and the limp that resulted , Hurtado went swiftly down the ramp , and near the bottom he caught up with Natale . " Here I am , " he said . He took the flight bag from her . " Everythingall right ? " " Thanks for taking the bag , " she said . " I did n't know it would he so heavy . " " My fault , " he said cheerfully . " I stuffed a camera and a pair of large binoculars under your things . Wanted to get a picture and closeup view of the domain area from a distance . Natale , one day you 'll be able to look through both of them yourself . " " If the Blessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertainly . " Anyway , you must tell me what you see . " " I will , " he promised.  |p276Now  that they had managed to get his explosives through , he felt elated . He was closer to his goal and success . Guiding Natale toward the grotto , he saw that it was swarming with worshippers . There were even police spotted about . He would be able to ascend the hill next to the grotto and secrete the explosives , of that he was sure , but setting the explosives in place behind the statue of the Virgin Mary , and wiring it to the detonator , would be impossible in the daylight . He would have to return when it was dark , around midnight , and the worshippers were asleep and the police guards had gone off duty . Ahead , at the rear of the many benches facing the grotto , he saw an elderly woman rise from her seat and move away . Hurriedly , he led Natale to the bench and settled her into the empty place . He told Natale exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to the grotto . " You just sit here and pray , " he said . " I 'll take the bag with me , and see that your candle is lighted . And I 'll fill the bottles with water . " " You 're so sweet , Mikel . " " I do this for all my loves , " he said lightly , and bent down and kissed the smile off her lips . " Be back soon . " Slowly , easily , he picked his way through the crowd on the far side of the grotto . No one was paying any attention to anything except the cave in the hillside . It was almost too easy to drift away , and be interested in the foliage of the hillside , and move up it unhurriedly inspecting the plants and gradually disappear behind a group of trees . He continued climbing a short distance , until the grotto itself was hidden from view . He sought the depression behind the large oak tree he had spotted earlier , and he found it filled with fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Setting down Natale 's flight bag , he knelt and began using both hands to scoop the debris out of the hole . When he had finished his excavation , he was pleased . The depression would be deep enough to hold and hide his equipment . Emptying Natale 's bag of the bottles and candle , he gingerly took out his own packages containing the sticks of dynamite , thep277detonator , the clock , the wiring , the tape , and the shopping bag . Casting about to see if he had by chance been followed , or , indeed , if there were any other climbers in the vicinity , he was satisfied that he was quite alone . He resumed work , lowering his packages into the hole , covering them with the folded shopping bag . Quickly , he scooped up the debris beside the hole , the dead leaves , branches , brush , and covered the shopping bag with them until the explosives and other materials were completely buried out of sight . Rising , he examined his handiwork . The leafy surface of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by nature . Carefully , he restored Natale 's bottles and candle to her flight bag . Then , with one hand , he dusted all signs of the foliage from his jacket and trousers . Taking up the bag , careful of his footing , he began his descent , noting every obvious landmark that would guide him on his return late that night . When he came off the hill , he was sure that almost no one had seen him , or if they had , they would have small curiosity about this nature lover and exercise freak . Ready to melt into the crowd surrounding the grotto , he became aware of the flight bag in his hand . He had told Natale that he would take care of her candle and her plastic bottles . He searched off toward the baths , saw the rows of flickering candles nearby , and went to them and piously lighted Natale 's candle and placed it alongside the others . Next , dutifully , he approached a water gutter with a spigot at either end where pilgrims were lined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , his turn came . He uncapped each of Natale 's empty plastic bottles , several shaped like the Virgin Mary , and filled all of them , one by one , with the supposedly curative water , and then capped each bottle and set it in the flight bag . All there was left to do was to return to Natale , and guide her back to the hotel for lunch . Weaving through the people milling about the grotto , he thought of Natale , of how attracted he was to her . He thought of her vivacity and her magnificent body and her passion , and suddenly he was impatient to take her to the hotel , get lunch over with if she was hungry , and return to her room for another memorable coupling . Anticipating this , he wondered about something else . Hep278wondered how serious he was about her , and how much he wanted to deal with her in the future . Was she the woman he had always fantasied about and hoped to live with for the rest of his life ? Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , one who would forever be afflicted ? He did not know , or even know if she was interested in giving her own life over to an unseen Basque revolutionary  --  and a struggling author . Well , he told himself , it would all work itself out some way . He had expected to find her on the bench as he had left her , occupied with silent prayer or meditating behind those dark glasses . Instead , when she came into sight , he saw that she was engaged in an animated conversation with a vaguely familiar older woman , a rather tall woman with black hair drawn back severely into a bun , who was seated beside her . Puzzled , he advanced upon the pair . The older woman was speaking now , and Natale listening , as Hurtado came upon them . He waited for the other woman to finish , and then he stepped closer , and touched Natale on the shoulder . " Natale , " he said , " It 's Mikel . I have all your bottles  --  " Natale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she reached for his hand . " Mikel , you must meet someone dear to me . The lady I 'm talking to is Rosa Zennaro , our family friend from Rome and my helper here in Lourdes . " " Yes , of course , " said Hurtado , offering her a bow and a smile , " the one for whom we left the note . Pleased to meet you , Signora Zennaro . " " The pleasure is mine , " said Rosa . " Natale has been telling me all about you  --  " " Not quite all , " said Natale to Hurtado , blushing. "  --  and that you are competing to replace me by becoming her brancardier , " Rosa finished . " I 'm sure that would be impossible , " said Hurtado . " I saw you two deep in conversation , and I really did n't mean to interrupt . " " Nothing important , " said Rosa . " I was merely telling Natale about the statue of the Virgin Mary in the niche beside the grotto . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't miss it . " Hurtado peered off guiltily , unable to admit that he knew itp279well , had been closer to it than either of them , and the plans he had for its demise . " Yes , " he said . " Quite attractive . " " But Bernadette did n't think so , Mikel . " Natale turned , fumblingfor Rosa 's arm and tugging it . " Rosa , tell Mikel about the statue  --  he 'll be so interested . " Without protest , Rosa launched into telling the story a second time . " There had been a plaster statuette of the Virgin in the niche next to the grotto , placed there by the townsfolk . Two sisters in Lyons , much devoted to the grotto , wanted to replace it with a larger and more accurate statue of the apparition that Bernadette had seen . They commissioned a well-known sculptor , Joseph Fabisch , of the Lyons Academy of Arts , to prepare it . Fabisch traveled down to Lourdes to interview Bernadette and get a description from her of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was the Immaculate Conception . To describe what Bernadette had seen , Fabisch later recorded , ' Bernadette got up with the greatest simplicity . She joined her hands and raised her eyes to heaven . I have never seen anything more beautiful ... . Neither Mino da Fiesole , nor Perugino , nor Raphael have ever done anything so sweet and yet so profound as was the look of that young girl , consumptive to her fingertips . ' Somewhat according to Bernadette 's specifications , but allowing himself a degree of artist 's license , Fabisch carved his large statue out of Carrara marble . When Father Peyramale received the statue in Lourdes , and showed it to Bernadette , she exclaimed , ' No , that 's not it ! ' " Natale was delighted . " Bernadette could n't pretend about anything . " " Bernadette did not withhold her criticism , " Rosa went on . " She considered the statue too tall , too mature , too fancy , and she insisted that by making the Virgin raise her eyes but not her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nevertheless , the statue was placed in the niche with great ceremony on April 4 , 1 863 . Bernadette was not allowed to attend , presumably because curiosity-seekers might bother her . But I suspect that she was kept away because she might be too frank and make a negative remark about the statue . " " Very amusing , " said Hurtado , feeling guiltier than ever.  | " Well , shall we all have lunch ? You 'll join us , wo n't you , Mrs. Zennaro ? " " Thank you , " said Rosa . " I 'd enjoy that . " " Mikel , you go ahead of us , please . I want a few moments alone with Rosa , to discuss something personal . We 'll be right behind you . " " Okay , " said Hurtado , starting away . But before he was out of earshot , he could overhear Natale and Rosa conversing in stage whispers . They were still speaking in English . Natale was saying , " Rosa , is n't he wonderful ? I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you give me some idea what he looks like ? " Rosa was answering , " He 's ugly as sin , like something monstrousout of Goya . Pop eyes , squashed nose , crooked teeth , and as big as a gorilla . " " Now I know that 's untrue , " said Natale laughing . " You 're joking , are n't you ? " " Joking completely , dear one . He 's as handsome as you could have wished for . He looks like an artist  --  " " He 's a writer , " said Natale . " I can believe that . He is perhaps five foot ten , slight but sinewy , strong face with dark soulful eyes , straight longish nose , full lips , determined jaw , and close-cropped dark auburn hair . Very intense all around , like one who knows what he is after and is going to get it . " Listening , Hurtado mouthed a soft amen , and trudged on up the ramp . For Gisele Dupree , it had been a leisurely morning . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so after lying abed late , she had decided to dress and go out and take care of a few odds and ends . On the Avenue Bernadette Soubirous , she had stopped to purchase some cosmetics  --  eye-liner , lipstick , moisturizer  --  to bolsterher new resolve to begin wearing make-up again . Then she had gone along the Rue de la Grotte until she reached a leather storep281that had a red wallet she liked , and she had decided to buy it . At the last moment , about to stock up on food , she had remembered the roll of film that she had taken of her Nantes pilgrim group at the grotto the day before yesterday . For a gratuity , she had been guaranteed a forty-eight-hour delivery . She had detoured to the camera shop , picked up the color prints , and promised herself to drop them at the tour group 's hotel after lunch . Tucking the packet of prints in her purse , she had set off for the food shops , determined to cut her lunch and dinner bills by eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the tiny dining room of the cool apartment , after heating some tomato soup , preparing a chopped egg salad , and putting jelly on a croissant , she sat down with a few days of accumulated copies of Le Figaro to catch up on the news that was already old . She had started to read when she recalled the packet of photographs and decided to see if they had all come out well , since she had never been one of the world 's best photographers . Finding the packet in her purse , she took it back to the table , pulled out the prints and resumed digging into her salad . The prints of the group , mostly posed and static , had come out fairly well , at least each one was in focus . As she turned them over , one by one , she counted nine of them . Then , to her surprise , there were three more photographs of a complete stranger , some lone older man standing in the sun near the grotto . The pictures had been shot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing in the sun , his suit clinging to him , obviously because he 'd been in the baths , with a slight blur resembling the feathers of a small bird fluttering in front of his shirt . The second picture showed him bending down , picking up what might have been the bird with outspread wings . And finally the third picture showed the man fastening the bird  --  no , not a bird , but a mustache  --  to his upper lip , and with that photograph he was no longer a stranger . She recognizedhim . He was Samuel Talley , her former client , the professor from New York . Instantly , recollection came . As she had been photographing the tour group , she had seen Talley standing alone near them . Asp282a lark , she had diverted the lens of her camera to focus on him and had taken three automatic fast snapshots of him . Perhaps she had done it for fun , to please him with a record of his visit to the grotto , which could be plainly seen in the distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive , to please him in order to wheedleanother tip from him . She had a long way to go to reach that translator 's school in Paris , but still those tips added up , each one counted . Anyway , the pictures of Talley were crazy . She had ceased eating to consider each picture again . At first the sequence made no sense , and then she realized that it did . The crazy thing was the mustache , the flowing Talley mustache . It was false , a false mustache . She recreated the scene . He had come out of the baths , and his mustache had fallen off , because he had been immersed in the water . He had stooped to retrieve it . He had pasted it back on his upper lip . Funny . But odd , also . She had thought his shaggy mustache real . But here she could see it was false , a disguise . Why on earth would a nobody professor from far away want to wear a disguise in a place where he was a foreigner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to be recognized , and was therefore not unknown , and therefore a visitor who might be known but preferred to be in Lourdes unknown . The intrigue side of her mind was going a mile a minute now  --  a favorite expression from America  --  and her curiosity was thoroughly aroused . Why the devil would a nonentity of a professor worry about being seen in Lourdes ? Maybe he was trying to avoid a onetime French girl friend who might be here ? Maybe he was trying to avoid a local creditor in Lourdes whom he owed for a previous extravagance beyond his means ? OrMaybe he was n't Samuel Talley at all . Maybe his name was false just like his mustache . Maybe he was someone else , someone more important , someone who for some reason did not want to be identified with Lourdes.  |p283Someone  important ? Gisele threw aside the second and third photographs , and concentrated on the first one , the one of Talley sans mustache , the older man with his face exposed , looking as he really looked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staring at the Slavic countenance in the picture . There were thousands and thousands of important faces in the world , and she knew only a few of them , mainly those that belonged to entertainers or politicians she had seen featured in the daily newspapers . Yet this particular photograph of the man who called himself Talley , the man who had lost his false mustache , had a look of familiarity about him . It was as if she had seen him somewhere before . The obviously Slavic features , now with the upper lip growth out of the way . An upper lip with a wart . Slavic features on a man who had told-her he was an American of Russian parentage and taught Russian at Columbia University , and yet might be somebody else . ButGisele blinked . Why not Russian , really Russian ? Then like a bolt it struck her , recognition struck her . She had seen this man before , or his double , in person , in the newspapers . She ransacked through recent memory , the UN months . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wart . Her lover , Charles Sarrat , had taken her to a UN reception , and she had seen the great man , had been awed to see him up close . And again , just the day before yesterday , on the front page of Le Figaro . Her hand streaked to the backlog of unread copies of the newspapers . The day-before-yesterday 's edition , the front page , and there it was , and there he was on the front page before her . One of the three candidates being speculated upon as the possible successor to the ailing premier of the Soviet Union . There he was in the paper , the very face in the color photograph she had taken at the grotto . Sergei Tikhanov , foreign minister of the Union of Soviet SocialistRepublics . It could n't be , it just could n't be . But it might be , almost certainly it might be . Quickly , she had the faces side by side , the one in the Parisp284newspaper , the one in the photograph she had taken playfully yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Absolutely , they were one and the same . Samuel Talley , of the false mustache , was actually the renowned and mighty Sergei Tikhanov . My God , Holy Jesus , if this were true . The clever and deductive side of her mind was racing now , outlining possibilities , one logical possibility . The successor to the leadership of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was ill . As Talley , he had admitted that he was ill . He was in line for the top job in Russia . But he was ill , and maybe doctors did n't give him much hope . So he was trying for any cure , and Lourdes had been in the headlines these past weeks . In desperation , he had made the decision to visit Lourdes . But as a leader of the biggest atheistic state in the world , he dared not let it be known that he was indulging in a romantic and wild enterprise like seeking succor from the Virgin Mary at the foremost Catholic shrine . Therefore , he had come here under a pseudonym @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaken by the enormity of her discovery . If true . The discovery was a prize , but it had to be true , verified , proved . There could be no mistake . Her only evidence was the very clear snapshot of Talley-Tikhanov taken near the grotto , and the one in the photograph resembled the image in her memory of the Soviet foreign minister she had seen up close briefly at the United Nations reception . But memory could be faulty , inexact . Then there was the photograph in the newspaper , clear yet not totally clear because it was reproduced on cheap newsprint . What additional evidence did she need ? For one thing , a better photograph of Tikhanov that would be clearer than the one in the newspaper , a real print that she could hold beside her own clear snapshot taken at the grotto . And one more thing . Absolute evidence that Talley , the name , was fake , that it was not his own name but as much a disguise as his mustache . If that could be proved , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tikhanov showed him to be the one at the grotto ,  |p285then  there would be no more doubt . She would be able to expose someone who , at any cost , did not want to be exposed . She would be on to a big one , the biggest break in her young life . But first the evidence . Gisele considered the next step , actually two steps , and in moments she knew exactly what to do . First , the truer photograph of the actual Foreign Minister Tikhanov . Once she had that evidence , she could take her second step . The first step , the better photograph , had to come from somewhere , obviously a photo agency or a newspaper photo file . That was a problem . Lourdes had no photo agency and its newspaper would be too small and too limited to have a folder of portraits of a Soviet foreign minister in its files . Only the big city papers would have such files . Like Marseilles , Lyons , Paris . If she could contact one of those newspapers  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her good friend , Michelle Demalliot , head of the Sanctuaries Press Bureau , might be the one person to help her . Gisele had an eye on the clock . There was n't time enough to go down to the press center and talk to Michelle , and get back into town in time for her tour . Well , she need n't do it in person . The telephone would be enough . Pushing aside her half-finished salad , she went into the living room , found the white and red telephone book titled Hautes-Pyrenees which listed telephone numbers in Lourdes and Tarbes . Finding the listing for the Sanctuaries Press Bureau , she sat next to the phone and dialed the number . An unfamiliar female voice answered . " Is Michelle Demalliot there ? " Gisele asked . " She 's just going out the door to lunch . I 'll try to catch her . " " Please ! Tell her Gisele Dupree is calling . " Gisele held on , and then was relieved to hear Michelle 's voice on the phone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to make you late for lunch , but I need a favor . " " Of course . What ? " " I need some still photographs of the Soviet Union 's foreign minister , you know , Sergei Tikhanov . I need them as soon as possi-ble. "  | " Whatever for ? " " Because  --  because when I was at the United Nations  --  remember ?  --  Isaw him and met him , and some small magazine has asked me to write a short piece on him , but they wo n't buy it without a picture . So I wondered if you had any press people still coming to Lourdes , today , tomorrow , whom you might talk into bringing a few pictures of Tikhanov along ? Can you think of any-one ? " " Well , everyone is mostly here waiting for the Reappearance , but there may be a few more  --  wait , let me see . " Michelle left the phone for thirty seconds and then she was back on the line . " I just checked . You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening from Paris , a photographer from Paris-Match , to do a layout of the activity here and hang around to photograph the person who sees the Virgin Mary , if someone does . I could call him at Paris-Match , probably catch him . If I do , you want a photograph of Sergei Tikhanov ? " " A good clear glossy portrait of his face from their file . I 'll pay for it . If I can see a couple of shots all the better . Can you call me back ? Here 's the number I 'm at . " She read off Dominique 's phone number . " All right , Gisele , let me call Paris right this second . If I ca n't pull it off in five minutes , I 'll let you know . If he can bring your pictures , I wo n't bother to call back . You 'll know they 'll be here tonight . You can pick them up at the Press Bureau around eight tonight . How 's that ? " " Super . You 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung up thinking , A million , a million , God knows what it might be worth if it was true . She sat there beside the phone , hoping it would not ring . She sat waiting for five minutes , six , seven , ten . No ring . That meant her friend had reached Paris-Match . That meant the photographs of Tikhanov would be in her hands tonight . Step one on its way . Next , step two . To find out if Talley really was Samuel Talley , a professor in the language department at Columbia University.  |p287Gisele  knew exactly how to find out . Her old American friend Roy Zimborg had graduated from Columbia University . She glanced at the mantel clock . She had no time for the call to New York now . She 'd better be off to her job . Besides , it would be terrible to wake Zimborg at this early hour in New York . It would be better late tonight , maybe midnight , when it would be six in the evening in New York and when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the same person she had caught in her own amateur 's snapshot at the grotto . She sat very still , a smile wreathing her face . A miracle was happening in Lourdes , after all , a personal miracleall her own . By tonight she might have her ticket and her passport to the United Nations . She could not think of it as blackmail . Only as good fortune to one who was so deserving.  |p288They  were coming out of the parking lot on the Rue de Lourdes in Nevers , where they had left their rented Peugeot and were starting uphill toward the Saint-Gildard Convent , Bernadette'slast resting place and their destination . Early this morning Liz Finch and Amanda Spenser had taken an Air Inter flight from Lourdes to Paris , rented the car , and driven down to Nevers in three hours . Walking now in the midday heat , Amanda spoke . " Do you think anything will come of this ? " she wondered . " Maybe it 's a wild goose chase . " Liz shrugged . " Never can tell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You just keep burrowing and burrowing , and hope for a gleam of gold . I do n't expect we 'll find anyone here as bitchy as Father Cayoux . Yet , we might find something  --  we just might . "  |p289They  had reached the eight-foot-high convent wall that led to the open gates at the entrance . A diminutive middle-aged nun , in gray habit , short skirt , standing inside the gates , was waiting for them . She had a broad smooth brow , unlined peach complexion , bright intelligent dark eyes , and a gentle smile . " Miss Liz Finch ? Miss Amanda Spenser ? You are the Americanswe are expecting ? " " None other , " said Liz . " I 'm Sister Francesca  --  " " Who speaks perfect English , " said Liz . " I hope so , " said the nun , " coming , as I do , from an American father and a French mother . Well , welcome to Saint-Gildard Convent . " She paused . " I understand you are writing a story on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your assistant . We are glad to cooperate . You 'll have to give me an idea what you want to know . Saint-Gildard Convent was , of course , Saint Bernadette 's last station on earth . Do you want me to show you around first ? " " Definitely , " said Liz . " Miss Spenser and I want to see everythingrelated to Bernadette . After that , we 'd like to spend a little while with you asking some questions . " " I hope that I have the answers , " said Sister Francesca . " But let 's begin with a brief guided tour . " The nun was leading them past a long bank of lavendercoloredflowers , and they followed her until she slowed down . " La Grotte de Lourdes , " Sister Francesca announced . To Amanda 's surprise , they were standing in front of a replica of the original grotto at Lourdes , smaller than the real one , but hardly miniature , either , a replica of the real grotto created on a slope that ran uphill to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nun said . Then Amanda realized that , behind them , but facing the duplicategrotto , were rows of benches for pilgrims , and that a horde of pilgrims was this moment leaving the benches and filing out toward another exit on the side . " Those are the members of a German pilgrimage from Cologneand Dortmund , about four hundred of them , " the nun explained . " They have finished their religious services now and arep290going across the Boulevard Victor Hugo to our Abri du Merin  --  our pilgrim shelter or dormitory for visitors . This group will remain for tonight and then go on to Lourdes itself . " Amanda was examining the replica grotto once more . There , at the upper right , inside the niche , was a blue and white statue of the Virgin Mary . " The plaque beneath the statue , " said Sister Francesca , " tells us that the little piece of rock mounted on it is an actual rock fragment from the real grotto of Massabielle in Lourdes . Now , let me show you our convent church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the replica grotto toward a courtyard , and was beckoning Liz and Amanda past a tall , white marble statue of the Virgin Mary to a side door of the church . Once inside the convent church , and proceeding down the center aisle between pews , Sister Francesca resumed speaking in a hushed tone . " This church was constructed in 1855 . It was modernizedtwice , the last time in 1972 . The white altar ahead is concrete . " Except for the modernity of the church 's interior decoration , Amanda felt that she had been inside this church before . She had visited at least a hundred churches in Europe , and they were always the same . High above the altar the arched ceiling and the multicoloredwindows . Behind the altar a crucifix , a bronze Jesus on a pale wooden cross . Immediately on either side of her , the rows of oak and walnut pews and a scattering of worshippers in silent prayer or meditation . Liz and Amanda had arrived at the two steps leading up to the altar , and halted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower . " After the apparitions , Bernadette was at a loss as to what to do with herself . True , she was going to school at last , and sometimes acting as a baby-sitter to earn money for her parents , but she was constantly the object of attention from both neighbors and the endless stream of visitors coming to Lourdes . She could not be alone . She was daily exposed to intruders with their questions . By 1863 , her mentors had decided that she needed a vocation , and suggested she enter some holy order as a nun . " " Maybe the church people just wanted her out of sight , " said Liz provocatively . " By then , she was a growing legend , yet shep291sometimes did not behave like one . She had a streak of stubbornness , I 've heard , and she disliked discipline , enjoyed playing pranks , had too lively an interest in fancy clothes . Maybe the churchmen wanted to get her off the streets and out of the way . To them , probably a convent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this setting , Liz 's assessment seemed harsh , and Amanda wondered how their nun guide would react . But Sister Francesca reacted nicely . " Some of that may have been true , " she agreed , " but actually many convents considered her a prize and were after her , although with reservations because her health was so poor and her fame might disrupt their routines . The Carmelites and the Bernardines were both after her . She rejected the latter because she did not like their ungainly headdress . When she settled on the order in Nevers , she remarked , I am going to Nevers because they did not lure-me . ' The mayor of Lourdes wanted her to become a dressmaker , but she told him she preferred to be a nun . On July 4 , 1866 , at the age of twenty-two , she left Lourdes forever , and took a train , her first and last train ride , to Nevers and entered our order . She remained here until her death on April 16 , 1879 , at the age of thirty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The nun paused , smiled , and said , " Now we can have a look at Saint Bernadetteherself . She rests in the chapel near the altar . " Trailing after the other two , Amanda could not imagine what to expect . They were facing the chapel , a restricted alcove , a narrow room almost sterile in its simplicity . The ceiling was a Gothic arch , the high windows dark blue , the three walls gray stone , and the centerpiece of the chapel was a large glass-and-gold casket , and inside it lay the body of a young woman , the object of their quest . " Bernadette , " the nun whispered . Unaccountably , Amanda found herself drawn closer to the casket . When she had approached the low railing that protected the chapel , her emotion had been combative , as if she were about to come face to face with the other woman , this woman who stood between Ken and herself and their planned life together . But now , preceding Liz and Sister Francesca to look closely at the casket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was **37;12895;TOOLONG rags . Except that to find such a child there on 01 Jack 's field trying to help mutilated and dying boys , a task from which  --  Hart believed  --  finer ladies would have fled fluttering and screaming , then to have the same unaccountable creature quite firmly refuse to be trifled with , despite her class . . . she was outside his experience . Besides , that night he had wished never again even to have to contemplate killing and destruction and his own violent instincts , although he knew he would have to return to all of them soon enough . Until then , she was a more than welcome diversion . " Over ther . " Her voice had been little more than a whisper , lying on the night like the whir of an insect . Beyond where he knew the turnpike must run , a patch of deeper darkness rose against the black sky . Hart could not make it out to be a house , but he trusted her knowledge of her own countryside . " Hold on . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the saddle , letting her slip back into it as he dismounted with a creak of leather and a jingle of spurs explosively loud in the darkness and silence . He made his way to the remembered rail fence that ran along the pike opposite her house , lowered the two top rails silently , and guided Mercury over . He replaced the rails , then led the horse quickly across the pike . Running his hand along the fence on the other side , he found the gate , opened it , and took them into the farmyard where he and Kirk had captured the two Yanks . If Kirk could see him now ! Hart held up his hands and she came lightly down from the saddle , her face  --  a white blur in the dark  --  moving closely past his . So he had delivered her home and was free to go , to rejoin Stuart , prepare himself for the blood and iron of another day . But he had not wanted to leave . He had wanted a clearer sense of this girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things generally , particularly himself . More likely , he had told himself , his rake 's blood was still running ; she was female and he had not quite given up . He let his hands linger on her arms . " You hungry ? " She was still whispering . Hart seldom wanted to eat after a battle , particularly not meat . " Some more of that buttermilk maybe . " " Iffen Paw'n'em ai nt took it to the cellar . " " I 'll wait here while you see . " She had disappeared , silent as a butterfly . Mercury moved betweenHart and the fence , reins trailing the ground . Hart eased himselfgratefully down against the trunk of the sycamore to which the sorry Yank horses had been tethered , keeping the tree between himselfand the pike . A cool draught of the buttermilk , he thought , his lids heavy , and he would he on his was ' . Unless this woods girl showedp251some sign she really wanted to play . It had been a long time since he had touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , even if . . . he had not even known it when his head slumped forward and his eyes closed . But he knew immediately upon awakening that he had passed the night with his head in her lap ; and he began to wonder ignobly , as she wept with her face in her hands , whether she had somehow picked up some fancy ladylike notion that because he had done so she was " ruined . " Good God , he thought , how can I deal with that ? He was about to rise and call in Mercury for rescue , when withoutwarning Missy turned from the tree trunk , threw herself against him as he rose to his knees , and clasped her thin arms about his neck with surprising strength . " Never comin back ! " Her tearful cheek was warm against his . " I know you ai nt ! " Startled , almost knocked over by the force of her charge against him , reflexively seeking to keep his physical balance , Fargo Hart put his arms around her , heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been struck . He knew then that he could do anything he wanted with her . Why she had resisted , then flown like a wild thing into his arms , he would try to figure out later ; but in the trembling of her body , in the passionate whisper of her breath against his skin , the moisture of her tears on his cheek , in the anguish of her single outcry , he knew she was his , ardently , completely  --  a sense new to him and his more sophisticated experience . He was astonished at such a gift . In the dawning light , too , as he looked over her sharp little shoulder at the unpainted house , the rickety stoop , the scratchy yard , he sensed again the poverty and limits of her life , the elemental nature of it , the lack of adornment and artifice , and was overwhelmed suddenly with wonder that she had grown here , somehow , like a wildflower . Like Queen Anne 's lace . At that moment , behind him to the east and towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grumpily , the first dawn sounds heralding a battle day , signaling war 's iron demands . But that morning , rather than responding like a soldier to the beckoning guns , Hart was lost in an eternal wonder  --  not only that she should have flowered in that dust , but that despite 01 Jack 's shot and cannon and the blood that seemed now to tinge the rising sun he had found her there in her warmth and openness  --  this incredible gift , this sudden quiet peace in the midst of war . " I 'll come back . " His lips moved on her wet cheek . " You promise ? " " Promise . I 'll be back . " He marveled to realize that he meant it . " Please ... I love you ... "  |p252Hart  had never heard those words spoken truly . But before he could reflect on their simplicity and its meaning , or how he knew they were true , he heard at the side of the house , just around the corner out of sight , the creaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hart rose and pulled Missy to her feet , a gaunt farmer in butternut trousers and a faded blue shirt lunged around the corner . He stopped abruptly as he saw Missy and Hart under the sycamore . A huge Negro , one suspender holding up his ragged pants , came around the corner and stopped , too , his dark face blank as iron . Behind Hart , the sharp staccato pop-popping of musketry  --  the unmistakablereports of skirmishers meeting pickets  --  crackled down the pike . The guns were booming steadily now . " You , Missy ! " The farmer tried to sound fierce but Hart detected a whining note in his voice . " I-uz heppin-um , Paw . Overt Brawner 's . Must be a thousan'um lyin shot'n needin water . " Her father stared uncertainly from Missy to Hart and back again . " I brought your daughter home . Like she said , she was doing what she could for the wounded . " " Yeah . Uh . . . you Missy ! Git on down at confoun cellar'n look after Maw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking back at Hart . He smiled , thinking how she looked more than ever ready for flight , to leap and soar . " I 'll be back , " he murmured . " Never you fear . " Her face lit from within , as if her senses were actually glowing in her skull . He did not know that it was not just his words , but his smile , too , that had infused her with light . Missy believed his words implicitly ; but his smile told her that he wanted to come back , that he would not just keep a promise . He would seek her . Then , like the wild thing he imagined , she was gone , moving light as a falling leaf past her father and the massive African . " Confoun girl got no more sense'n God give a billygoat . " The farmer tried to look stern and fatherly . " Messin round em sojer boys . " Hart whistled softly to Mercury , who came up immediately . " Your daughter 's a fine young woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps sharper than was necessary . " You 've no cause to be angry with her . " He stared fixedly at the man ; these poor whites had to be dealt with firmly and he had no intention that this one should punish Missy when he had no reason . " Reck'n not , then . You with the Virginia boys ? " " Of course . Stuart 's staff . " " Stuart ! If at do n't beat all . " The man looked at the African triumphantly , but the black face was impassive . " I uz jus thinkinp253bout Stuart . " Brace did not know one general from another , except that everybody had heard of Stonewall Jackson . " What about Stuart ? " Hart did not trouble to disguise the contempt in his voice . It did not occur to him that Missy 's Paw was just an older version of the fierce , rawboned boys 01 Jack had sent yelling down Brawner 's hill in the bloody twilight . " Me'n Henry here . . . " Brace jerked his head at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herebouts no better'n usuns . Reck'n Gin'al Stuart needs'im a coupla guides ? " Hart swung into the saddle , stiff still from sleep , and stared at Missy 's Paw with distaste . There was nothing the elegant Stuart was less likely to want around headquarters than a poor-white farmer looking like a mangy hound , and his sullen darky . Still . . . Hart had learned that the road network in the vicinity was tangled and confusing . Getting Longstreet and 01 Jack back together in one army would be a hard job at best , and probably Stuart 's to manage . " Might use you . No harm to ask . " " Henry ! Hustle downa woods'n saddle up at mare . You take the mule . Git crackin . " " Ai nt ought to ride at mare yit . " Henry made no move . " She be okay . Saddl'er up . " Henry turned and went around the house , his body heavy with disapproval . In the distance , the musketry was continuous and rising . An attack going in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attackers were moving , out from or toward Jackson 's line along the old railway . Suddenly , he was eager to find Stuart , anxious to get back to the army , the only life he knew anymore . Already , the feel of Missy in his arms was fading , the wonder lost in the unpleasant talk with her father , the commonplace sound of gunfire over Bull Run . A hot day was coming , with hot work to do . He recoiled suddenly from a dirty , calloused hand thrust up at him . Missy 's Paw stood by Mercury 's neck , grinning at Hart with yellow teeth . But Hart did not fail to notice the sharp flash of his eyes and the hard line of his jaw . " Name 's Brace , Cap'n . Durward P. Brace . Alluz wanted to shoot me a Yank . " Sally Sutherland Crowell awoke that morning to the sound of the gunfire to the west . Lying in what had been her childhood bed in what was now her brother 's house in Centreville , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p254But  the noise of violence was no less frightening  --  quite the opposite  --  because it was so often heard , from virtually any direction . In Virginia , no escape from it seemed possible ; and Sally thought fleetingly of removing to Columbia , South Carolina , where Lawrence'smother 's family had offered to take her in . Surely the war could never reach as far south as Columbia . But Sally did not want to sleep anywhere except in her own small bed , surrounded by the comforting relics of her placid childhood , until she had resolved her trouble , or at least had some idea what had brought it about . She had never been strong , but had never suffered real illness  --  and certainly had never known nameless fear  --  before the battle that had engulfed Lawrence 's house three weeks earlier . Obviously , that battle had started her trouble . As she often had in the days since , particularly with gunfire in her ears , Sally recalled how peacefully that day had begun  --  a clear , hot , August day with corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and along the forks of Cedar Run . But by noon the armies had closed menacingly near , on the Culpeper road , and shortly afterward the guns had started to boom . What a fool she 'd been not to leave when the servants begged her ! But somehow abandoning Lawrence 's house would have seemed as if she were abandoning him ; and by the time the Yankee surgeons moved in , shells were flying recklessly , troops were massing all about , and venturing from the house had appeared more dangerous than staying in it . At first she 'd wanted to help the surgeons , because wounded boys , even Yankees , needed help ; she 'd have been glad for anyone , even some Yankee women , to have helped Lawrence when he 'd gone down the year before with a bullet in his neck . But the Federal surgeonseither had ordered her roughly out of the way , or had implored her not to remain in such foul surroundings , so that soon she 'd retreated upstairs , with the din of battle rising outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun dipped toward the horizon , the southernboys had won the fight ; or so Sally supposed , because she 'd never since brought herself to read or hear a word about that grisly day . But a sort of stillness had suddenly fallen on the house , despite the battle noises outside ; and she realized the Yankee surgeons were gone . Up to that point , Sally had been mostly unafraid , even when a shell brought down the top part of the chimney on the roof , because she 'd trusted in her merciful Lord God , believed that under His benign eye death could only bring joyful reunion with Lawrence inp255Heaven . But when she ran downstairs the first thing she saw was the mound of obscene human garbage , of arms and legs and torn human flesh , piled under and around Lawrence 's mother 's harpsichord . After that moment , Sally remembered nothing of the time until neighbors found her the next day . They had nursed her for a few days back to something resembling sanity , then taken her to Culpeper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the Rappahannock . From there , servants had driven her to her brother 's house at Centreville , where on the first night in her old room her trouble had started . Now , in the broadening daylight , hearing the guns off toward Bull Run , Sally covered her eyes with her hands . What was happening to her ? Why could n't she resist the nauseous fear  --  of nothing and everything  --  that came without warning and departed without reason ? What was the trouble with her foot ? Why had the mere sight of a chaplain 's insignia evoked her trouble and brought back with a sickening rush the dreadful heap beneath the harpsichord ? Sally did not know . She could not remember . She was not even sure if there was anything to remember . And if there was , she dreaded knowing what . She wished Lawrence were there to hold her  --  and at the moment she thought of him holding her , she felt her stomach turn , and fear fall on her like a shroud , and little icy needles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a job for you . " " Yessir . " Amos Gilmore had earned his preferred position as General Hoke Arnall 's scout , forager , and handyman by never questioning an assignment he was given , and never troubling Arnall with the details of how he had carried it out  --  as he always did . " Look around beyond those woods out there . " Arnall 's Brigade front looked out on dense trees and underbrush . " Push ahead as far as possible . Find out anything you can about what troops 're out there , how many , how they 're positioned . " " Right off , sir . " Gilmore saluted . The camp was quiet , most of the men still sleeping . " Look sharp , Gilmer . They 'll have plenty of pickets out . " " Ai nt worried , sir . " " And remember ... I want information , not a dead corporal . Do n't get shot by some of our boys comin back . " Gilmore grinned . " They 'd be too skeert to shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ranks of sleeping men , making only a slight detour to pass the boy . See he 's still gittin his rest . Ironass 'll have'im up'n jumpin any minute . Gilmore had been astonished in the night when the boy had whispered to him some words he called " lines "  --  something about the beauty of a summer day . Gilmore had no idea what the lines meant but with the boy 's hand touching him , he had n't needed to know ; the words and the touch had given him the only sense of anything like beauty he 'd ever had  --  except sometimes before the war , when he 'd been alone in the woods with the sunlight coming through the trees . Gilmore did not think in terms of love and romance , any more than of beauty ; in his life he had only taken what he could get . But he knew he needed somehow to hold this boy close ; and it had been years , back maybe to Gilmore 's dimly remembered mother , dead since he was a tyke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , General Arnall thought , watching Gilmore trot over the railroad cut and disappear into the woods beyond . An animal . God knows how he does what he does . Arnall had waked before dawn with a sense of anticipation and a feeling of satisfaction that his brigade was in an exposed position rather than in reserve or out of action . He had called the burly corporal to his side as soon as he had pulled on his boots ; and if Gilmore brought back the intelligence Arnall hoped for , some Yanks were going to get a nasty surprise . There was a sort of poetic justice in the situation ; or better still , God 's guiding hand . Arnall could not help thinking that , as he gulped down the hot coffee and the hunk of bacon Private Folsom provided . An officer unfairly placed in arrest for an offense he had n't even committed , by a commander either crazy or tyrannical or both , suddenlyfinding himself vital to that commander 's army  --  maybe the key to victory or defeat . Even in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its most exposed brigade , was covering Jackson 's last-chance escape route across Sudley Ford to Aldie Gap . Well , the Lord be praised . Hoke Arnall meant to show the world , crazy Tom Jackson in particular , what he was made of . If it was providential  --  and of course it was  --  that his chance should come so soon , he believed he was ready to make the most of it . When the sun went down that day , the arrest of Hoke Arnall was going to look like the craziest move 01 Jack had ever made . Light was streaking the eastern sky behind him , and Arnall expectantly checked the watch that had been his father 's . As if on schedule , Federal guns opened somewhere near the pike . He listened as shells burst harmlessly in the woods in front of his position . " Let it come , " he murmured into the sudden commotion of his aroused camp . " Let it come . " Except , of course , for one thing . Unobtrusively , Arnall moved away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He never made a spectacle of religion as some men did , but he knew that if God 's hand had sent the day only God 's favor could let Hoke Arnall realize it . Besides , in the slowly growing morning light , with the sun signalingits presence just below the horizon , the flaws in Arnall 's positionwere obvious to his trained eye  --  and worrisome enough that he made quick work of his prayers in order to be up and about . The railroad cut running across the slope of the knoll on which Hill had posted his brigade of just over 1,500 men might ordinarily have been held against a whole army , not just the division Arnall thought was probably in his front . But he was holding the left flank of ' Jackson 's entire line ; and to anchor Arnall 's own left , the farthest outpost of Jackson 's force , there was nothing more than a rail fence.  |p258Running  at somewhat less than a right angle to the railroad cut , it provided little cover for Arnall 's troops or obstruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look over an open field that fell away gradually to Bull Run ; a stand of corn was at the far edge of the field . To the left of the cornfield and roughly in Arnall 's rear , the brick building of the Sudley Methodist Episcopal Church was shaded by a grove of trees . His brigade surgery was set up there . At least the open ground beyond the rail fence provided a decent field of fire . Arnall had posted Sam Stowe 's South Carolina regiment  --  maybethe best in the brigade  --  along the fence . " They 'll come across that field , Sam . Maybe not the first attack . But do n't be impatient . They 'll come . " Stowe moved his planter 's hat to the back of his head . " Nice of you to give us the easy job . " The steadiness of his manner gave Arnall more confidence about his flank than the open field of fire . He peered searchingly at the rest of his dispositions , seeking unspotted weak points . With two regiments on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's South Carolinians  --  and Sparks 's Tar Heel troops in reserve over the knoll behind them , Arnall 's Brigade of four regiments was deployed within an obtuse angle . Stowe 's regimentfaced northeast along the fence and those in the cut looked somewhat south of east , most nearly in the direction of the rumbling enemy guns . Arnall felt reasonably secure against an attack on Stowe 's tough regiment on his left , or directly against the railroad cut . And he did not lack support . Powell Hill had sent word that he was holding the brigades of Branch , Archer , and Pender in reserve , behind the frontlinepositions manned by Arnall , Thomas 's Brigade on his right and Field 's just beyond that , on Thomas 's right . Arnall could tell from dust clouds that men from Stuart 's cavalry also were ranging around in Hill 's rear , protecting the Sudley Ford across Bull Run . It was his right that most worried Arnall , as well as the wooded and brush-covered terrain in his front . A tongue of woodland actuallyentered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut . The woods and underbrush reduced visibility and offered cover to an advancing enemy . Worse , Thomas 's Brigade , next on Arnall 's right , was maybe a hundred yards distant  --  from Arnall 's right flank to Thomas 's left  --  and pulled back somewhat from the line of the unfinishedrailroad . Arnall had no idea why so excellent a commander as A. P. Hill had left such a gap in his line . And the gap was all the more threatening because at that point the railroad cut was deep and broad enough so that a substantial Yankee force might get into it and attack left or right . Colonel Jehue Sparks rode up beside Arnall and pointed a longp259finger at the gap in the line . A hard-bitten North Carolina tobacco grower who had been a lieutenant in Mexico , Sparks tended  --  in Arnall 's judgment  --  to get above himself with military advice . " I was some Yank gin'al , Hoke , I 'd fill that-er cut with bluebellies , first off . " Arnall did not need to be told by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the woods and the undefended gap in the line to get into the cut between the two brigades , his regiments could be isolated and cut to pieces , Hill 's line broken , and Jackson 's left turned . But Hoke Arnall was a professional soldier . He had placed his brigade where it had been ordered ; and though he had sent an urgent note to Hill calling attention to the gap , he believed he had no choice but to remain where he had been ordered to take position . But rebuffing Sparks , an enthusiastic fighter , made no sense with Yanks in spittin ' distance . " They do that ... " Arnall 's voice gave no hint of his own apprehension . " Be your job to root'em outta there . " Even this concern , serious as it was , could not dampen Hoke Arnall 's anticipation . As the light spread and the men huddled in the lines , Arnall was all over his sector , hectoring his regimental commanders , shouting at the men , checking details he might ordinarily have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , filling the air with smoke and noise and flying chunks of iron but doing little damage to anything but the troops ' eardrums . In the woods , skirmishers ' musketry was sharp and steady . Conscious as always of the example an officer had to set , Arnall rode about in the open as if the bursting shells were no more than a swarm of flies . So great was his self-control that before long he really did pay the shellfire no attention ; but the men of his brigade , while well-protected from the Yank gunners and bothered by only an occasionalwhining Minie ball , were not so oblivious to danger as their general . Nor were they so eager as he for the attack to develop ; few of them felt they had anything to prove . These were veterans of the Peninsula . They could read the signs and sounds of battle as well as their officers ; they knew they soon would be facing a heavy attack . And they were not as understanding as Arnall  --  who knew that long-range artillery duels were of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to respond to the Yank guns . Soldiers under shellfire always wanted to hear their own guns pouringit back to the enemy . " Goddam gunners settin up ther inna hills jerkin ther dicks . " Lige Flournoy had no use for gunners and cavalrymen anyway . " Reck'n they in the same army ? " All along the line , men were tense and anxious . Some prayed.  |p260Some  thought of wives and families and scratched off hasty notes . Others pinned scraps of paper with their names scribbled on them to their tattered jackets . Some resolutely stared into space or at the ground , trying to think of nothing . A few chattered nervously . Fear struck others dumb . Many , with the hard-won tactical instinct of experienced troops , knew their position on Jackson 's flank was crucial . Others looked at the gap in the line or at the underbrush in their front with as much concern as Arnall . There was no bravado . Arnall calculated that he had two men for every three to four feet of front he was supposed to defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be sure who or what was beyond Hill 's Division ; Ewell , he supposed , unless 01 Jack had shuffled things around in the night . Then Jackson 's own division  --  Taliaferro 's now  --  on the far right . Arnall did not know that both Ewell and Taliaferro had been severely wounded in the battle the night before at Brawner 's farm . Alexander Lawton had taken over Ewell 's Division and W. E. Starke now commanded Taliaferro 's ; both , like Arnall , were brigade commanders . That they were suddenly leading divisions would have troubled him had he known it . He certainly would not have wished ill fortune to Powell Hill , but he was too ambitious not to have begrudged such sudden eminence and responsibility for men of no greater rank than himself . Arnall slouched in his saddle , ignoring bursting shells , while he studied a hastily scribbled ammunition report provided by LieutenantFullenwiler , the brigade quartermaster . Fortunately , the brigade had scarcely been engaged since setting out on the march around Pope three  --  no , four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistlingoverhead and the men 's cartridge boxes had been refilled at Manassas . " Trains parked just beyond Sudley Ford . " Fullenwiler , a man of statistics and reports , was not so oblivious as Arnall to the continuingshell bursts . " We kin restock pretty easy . " And they 'd have to , if it turned out to be a long day of fighting . Arnall watched Fullenwiler 's shoulders jerk as another flight of shells exploded fifty yards beyond them ; but the lieutenant kept taut control of his face . Not his eyes , Arnall thought , noting to himself to get a new quartermaster . He jammed the ammunition report in his side pocket . " Take some of Sparks 's men and double the reserve boxes now . Garntee we gone need'em . " Before long , from the wooded ridge 500 yards to the rear and considerably higher than the railway line , Confederate guns opened with a roar  --  four batteries anyway , Arnall 's practiced ear soon determined . A cheer went up from the troops massed in the tight anglep261of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slackenednoticeably as the Yank cannoneers began to duel with the Reb batteries . By the time Corporal Gilmore came back and spoke briefly to the general , the sun stood clear and malignant in the eastern sky over the Federal artillery positions . Gilmore 's information tended to confirm Arnall 's instinct , and in battle he trusted his instincts more than anything except God and discipline . God-given instinct could tell you what was coming and what to do ; but discipline made it possible for officers and men to do what had to be done . Thus , disciplinewas Hoke Arnall 's credo , perfectly compatible with his profoundbelief in a living and watchful God ; only discipline , Arnall believed , gave men the strength to put God 's sometimes painful and demanding will into practice . He spurred Rambler to where Colonel Sparks had his Tar Heels lying down under the shellfire . Arnall called Sparks to his side and leaned down confidentially . " Colonel , we got Germans in those woods . Two brigades of'em so far . Now here 's what I aim to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a minute . When he finished and rode away , Sparks hastily gathered his officers around him . The crack of musketry was closer now and Arnall could tell that his picket lines , falling back slowly , had almost reached his main line , so that before long the brigade would feel the full weight of the enemy . From the volume of shelling and musketry , he knew it would be heavy ; and within his tight perimeter , the angle made by the railroad cut and the rail fence , there would be little or no room for any kind of maneuver . He would be able to watch virtually every man in action , even if on foot himself . Reluctantly , he swung down from the saddle  --  it lessened his sense of command not to be on horseback  --  and looked around for young Folsom . The orderly was nowhere in sight and Arnall , the tension of battle rising , swore as round an oath as he permitted himself : " Blast you , Folsom ! Get up here ! " The boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his trousers . A staff officer , grinning , watched him pass . " Where the devil you been , Folsom ? " Arnall knew , but the boy needed discipline anyway . " Call of nature , sir ! " Folsom 's face was crimson . In the hot morning sun , he was already perspiring ; sweat ran in trickles from under his forage cap . " Well , when I want you here , I want you here ! " Arnall held out the reins . " I want you where I can see you , understand ? " " Yessir ! " Folsom took the reins and snapped to rigid attention.  | " Well , go on , man ! " Arnall glared at him in disgust . " Take Ramblerto the rear , but keep'im saddled . And bring back my pistol . Snap it up , now ! " Folsom stumbled away , leading the stalwart bay he knew the general treasured ; so much as a scratch on that glistening hide and Folsom had no doubt he would pay for it . The staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time piss yuh pants , boy ! Ironass got no time to wait . " Amid the furious noise of the cannonade and the crackling of musket fire , Josh Beasly lay on his side , at ease against the forward rise of the railroad cut , his head just below the top . Good place to fight , he thought ; but that was not the main reason Josh looked forward to the day . He had been too far off to hear Ironass 's exchange with the calfeyedorderly , but even at a distance Josh had seen the fear on the boy 's face and the way he jumped like he had a bee up his bung . " At low-down sucker . " Josh muttered to himself . Foxy Bradshaw , lying facing him a yard away , read his lips . " You really gone do it , Josh ? " Foxy 's face lit at the thought , though his bowels were churning with fear . Too late now to head for the shithole and never come back . " Shut yuh goddam mouth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhatbeneath them on the floor of the railroad cut  --  men of McCrary'sSouth Carolina regiment , most of whom he did not know . Josh had no use for South Carolinians anyway . Snotty bastards . " A good day for it . " Foxy leered over his rifle barrel at an imaginarytarget , trying to cover fear with conversation . " Cooped up here like settin hens . " " Shut up , dammit ! " But Josh knew Foxy was right . He watched Ironass stomping around like cock-a-doodle-do . Sonomabitch wearin at fancy jacket like it do n't make'im red meat for a sharpshooter . The orderly came running with a pistol in a leather holster on a belt . " Hey , Meat . . . Ironass gittin on his peashooter . " Lige Flournoy winked at Josh , neither of them flinching from a shell burst nearby . Foxy buried his face in the dirt , holding back a scream , trying to scrunch his peter protectively into the earth . " Ca n't hit shit with at thang . " But Josh was thinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither . Hoke Arnall carefully buckled the pistol belt around his gray tunic and settled the holster on his right hip . He was well aware ofp263his junior officers watching him . He knew the pistol was a kind of badge  --  he had deliberately cultivated that idea . It was a .44-caliber Colt revolver , U.S. Army issue , that he 'd had since his Indian fighting days in Texas and New Mexico . But what the other officers really noticed was the ornate leather holster he 'd picked up from a Mex in the Rio Grande Valley in exchange for an army-issue canteen . Nothingregulation about that holster , decorated as it was with two silver discs , but Arnall had made a habit of buckling it on before battle . Of course , generals seldom got close enough to the enemy to use a pistol or any other weapon , but the ritual had come to be expected of him , just as some officers always buckled on a ceremonial or family heirloomsword before going into action , or Powell Hill put on his red shirt . Battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spun the cylinder . All five chambers were loaded with paper cartridges and capped ; the General carefully let the hammer down between the nipples , resting its head against the cylinder . The Mini &; balls were screeching frequentlybut the shellfire seemed to him to be slackening somewhat ; so the attack would be coming in any minute . He strode into the railroad cut  --  a tall , erect man with strapping shoulders , looking neither to right nor left . Stepping between Josh Beasly and Foxy Bradshaw , leaning into the sharp rise of the cut  --  about four feet deep at that point and slanting about forty-five degrees  --  Arnallstepped without hesitation to the crest and turned his broad back on the enemy fire . " Men ! " His roaring voice carried even above the rising crash of musketry . He pointed dramatically to his left . " This army depends on you today ! " A cheer went up along the line , most heartily from the wellprotectedSouth Carolina troops in the bottom of the cut . " The enemy is attackin our front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... at all costs ! " Even Lige ripped out a high-pitched yell at that . Ironass was one thing but 01 Jack was something else . Arnall was striding away , along the top of the cut , so that his words barely came back to Josh Beasly through the din of the fire rising from the woods . Show-off bastard , Josh thought . Had to fight inna line some day , we 'd see how much real guts he got. ... no firin until you get the order , men ! Front line fire'n fall back . Second line up the bank . . . fire'n fall back ... " All of which their company officers had already told them , but generals had to do something . Josh checked his piece . Tamped down and cocked hack . " Come on , Yanks ! "  |p264Josh  was suddenly impatient , and not just for Yanks . He rolled over , careful of the brandy bottle stuffed into his waistband , and inched farther up the bank until he could just see the woods beyond . His sweat-stained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he realized that sweat was pouring from its brim , across his forehead . And the sun not yet head-high . Nothing was moving in the woods but branches and leaves whipped about by Minie balls . Then , suddenly , the last line of butternutpickets was ducking and trotting back between the trees , bent low , as if the men were out hunting for turkey . The Yanks would n't be a hundred yards behind , Josh thought ; he got his musket over the top and settled its stock firmly against his shoulder . Just then Ironass came striding back along the top of the cut , peashooter in hand . Struttin like a goddam peacock . He stopped directly above Lige Flournoy , his back still to the Yankee fire , took off his hat , and waved it over his head as if signaling . " Now , Tar Heels ! " he yelled . " Give it to ' im ! " With a yell that pierced the rumble of the guns and the crack of musketry , Sparks 's North Carolina regiment ran charging over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad cut , through the South Carolinians kneeling at its bottom and Dixon 's riflemen sprawled above them . Hardly bothering to watch where they stepped , the Tar Heels , in a compact battle line and still yelling , bounded over the edge of the cut and in long , ground-eating strides made for the woods . Goddam , Lige Flournoy thought . Ca n't even wait for'em to git here . But as the Tar Heel battle line surged into the edge of the woods , Lige heard himself yelling , too . By the middle of the nineteenth century the earth of Prince William County and the plains around Manassas had been heavily tilled for more than a hundred years . Most of the county 's forests had long since fallen to the axe , and only occasional stands of timber and brush interrupted the pastures and fields that lay on the rolling hills . Scattered haphazardly on the landscape like a child 's building blocks were a number of unpainted farm houses , like that of Durward P. Brace , and a few more substantial dwellings  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warrenton Pike and the Sudley Springs Road , and Liberia , the brick mansion on the Manassas  --  CentrevilleRoad that had served as headquarters first for the Confederate General Pierre G. T. Beauregard , later for Irvin Mc/Dowell , and had been visited by Jefferson Davis as well as Abraham Lincoln . In the early morning of August 29 , 1862 , as Arnall 's Brigade braced for the Federal assault on Jackson 's left , an observer on a hill that rises just south of the Warrenton Pike , between Gainesville and Groveton and not far west of Durward Brace 's house , would have had a panoramic view eastward to Centreville , eight or nine miles distant on the heights beyond Bull Run . So unobstructed was the visibility from this hilltop that later in the battle about to unfold , General J.E.B. Stuart sited his headquarters there ; and afterward it became known as Stuart 's Hill . That clear , hot summer morning , even without field glasses , an observer on the hill would have been able to see  --  over the winding dirt lanes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the corn rows and pastures of the Brace , Monroe , and Cole farms  --  almost the whole of the battlefield of July 1861 , where northernand southern armies first had clashed . A year later , virtually at such an observer 's feet , a large part of John Pope 's Army of Virginia would have been in plain view , before the dust of moving brigades and the black powder smoke of artillery fire began to obscure details . As the sun rose above the ruins of Manassas Junction  --  visible to the southeast from Stuart 's Hill  --  Reynolds 's small division of McDowell 's Corps was some distance south of the pike , fronting northwest , not far from Groveton crossroads . Reynolds 's left had been exposed the night before when the Federal General King , in poor health and perhaps unnerved by the ferocity of the battle John Gibbon and Jackson had so suddenly fought , retreated with his divisionto Manassas . But Reynolds was tenuously in touch with Sigel 's Corps on his right . In the confused marching of Pope 's effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Manassas , then at Centreville  --  Sigel 's three divisions had camped the night before near the intersectionof the pike and the Sudley Springs Road , a little more than a mile from the Stone Bridge over Bull Run . They had been within cannon shot of Brawner 's farm but had made no effort to join the battle . Following Pope 's orders to attack Jackson at first light , Sigel 's troops , in early morning , were deployed in a slant across the pike  --  Brigadier General Robert Schenck 's Division south of it at Groveton crossroads and on the left of Sigel 's line , nearest Reynolds 's Pennsylvanians ; Brigadier General Robert Milroy 's Division north of the pike in Sigel 's center ; Brigadier General Carl Schurz 's Division on Sigel 's right , farther north of the pike and stretching east to the Sudley Springs Road . Beyond the Stone Bridge and Bull Run , under a cloud of dust ,  |p266the  pike to Centreville and the distant hilltop village itself were crowded with Federal troops  --  Kearny 's , Hooker 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had opened . Once they reached the field , and King 's Division followed Porter 's column up from Manassas as ordered , Pope would confront StonewallJackson with approximately 60,000 Federal troops . Jackson 's force was less visible . Beyond the pike Sudley Mountainrose forbiddingly against the hot sky ; it was wooded enough so that most of the Confederate battle line on its lower slopes , along the old railroad right-of-way , was masked from view . From the right and center of that line , however , open fields of fire sloped gently down for more than half a mile to the pike and to Young 's Branch twisting lazily back and forth across it . Jackson 's extreme right , the southwest terminus of his line , was near the crossing of the right-of-way and the pike , well to the west of Brawner 's farm , where the sanguinary conflict of the night before had been fought to a bitter draw . There , Jackson had placed Early 's Brigade and Forno 's , of Ewell 's Division , both brigades still under Early 's command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sent two regiments south of the pike near the base of the hill . To the left of Early and Forno in Jackson 's line of battle , and nearly a mile distant from them , was Taliaferro 's Division , with the Stonewall Brigade in its ranks and Brigadier General William E. Starke in command . Beyond Starke 's four understrength brigades  --  the Stonewall alone had lost nearly 200 men at Brawner 's and could put no more than 400 men in the field that morning , scarcely more than most regiments  --  the rest of Ewell 's Division , consisting of A. R. Lawton 's and Isaac Trimble 's brigades , under the command of Lawton , held the center . Hill 's Division , more than two and a half miles away and invisible in the woods near Sudley Springs , completed the line . In that battle line , Jackson deployed only 18,000 muskets to Pope 's near 60,000 . But the Confederate front was only about two miles long ( not including the gap between Early 's two brigades and the rest of the butternut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front line rather than some in reserve , about five muskets per running yard would have been pointed at the Federals . All or most of Pope 's men and some of Jackson 's would have been visible that morning to an observer on Stuart 's Hill and probablywould have riveted his attention . He might therefore not have looked over his shoulder , past Jackson 's right flank and northwest of Gainesville , or seen the dust cloud just beginning to rise far out on the road down from Thoroughfare Gap.  |p267With  Miss Letty 's handkerchief securely tucked into his jacket against his breast , Major Jesse Thomas was almost lighthearted as he rode beside General Longstreet ; and the stump of his arm was itching as it always did when a fight was near . The corps had been on the road since just after dawn , and every step in the choking dust was taking it nearer reunion with the other half of Lee 's army . Only thing is , Thomas thought , rubbing his stump against his side , I 'd have the boys goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no hurrying 01 Pete , although they could see the smoke of battle rising off to the left , maybe five or six miles ahead . When Thomas had raised the question not long after sighting the smoke , Longstreet  --  sitting his horse as solidly as a packsaddle  --  shook his head . " Jackson knows we 're comin . He needs us to hurry , he could send word . " And a few minutes later , in his decisive way , as if he had been further thinking over the matter : " Better let'em take their natural swing . No use wearin'em out on the road . " Well , nobody knew better what he was doing than Longstreet . Besides , General Lee , the Old Man himself , was riding up ahead with his escort . If he wanted a faster pace , he could certainly order it . Except that after the way Longstreet had carried Thoroughfare Gap , it was n't likely that even Lee would be telling him too much about how to handle troops . Thomas had been right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have sent to plug up the Gap , Longstreet had sent orders to the advance brigade to hold off attacking and to feel out their situation . The twilight skirmish had raised the dangerous possibility that Pope was holding the passage with enough men to check Longstreet ; 01 Pete said to Thomas that that was what he 'd do anyway , was he in Pope 's saddle , so that he could then turn on Jacksonand overwhelm him at leisure . So in the night , dark as it was , and in tangled and steep terrain , Longstreet sent three brigades under Cadmus Wilcox scrambling three miles north to Hopewell Gap  --  a higher and less usable cut through the Bull Run range . At the same time , Hood 's Texans , plainsmen though they might once have been , climbed and crawled a mere footpath over the top of the mountain through which Thoroughfare cut its gap . At sunup , Jones 's detached brigade was moving through Thoroughfare against the Federal front ; Hood was ready to attack one flank of what scouts had reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilcox , with mustaches flowing down his cheeks like hanging vines , was in position to envelop the Yanks from the other flank . " But them clodhoppin sons wa'nt even there , " a courier from Jones later reported through Major Thomas to Longstreet . " Skedaddlesometime last night , best we could figure out . " Longstreet and the Old Man had puzzled over what that meant . Why send a division to hold an important mountain pass , then pull it out before it had fired more than a few skirmishers ' shots  --  especially when those few had been set off by the approach of the enemy force you aimed to block ? The only reasonable answer seemed to be that Pope needed Ricketts 's men for the assault on Jackson even more than he needed them to block Longstreet . That rationale was what had caused Jesse Thomas 's early anxiety about the unhurried pace of the march . But the undeniable fact was that without a fight and before the dew was dry on the mountain ivy lining the two faces of ThoroughfareGap , 01 Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thomas touched Miss Letty 's handkerchief with his stump . Maybe , he thought , it 'll be a good luck piece for us ; maybe that 's what got us through the Gap . Phil Keefe had been a half mile from Manassas Junction when daylightcame . He was still crawling and the Federal wagon driver who soon spotted him  --  a Michigan man  --  was not sure at first whether he was seeing a man or some weird southern animal flushed from deep woods by the advance of the armies . But when the driver determinedthat the dusty , bloody apparition at the side of the road was indeed a man  --  a Federal soldier at that , dragging a mangled leg behind him  --  he immediately dismounted to help . No one else had noticed Phil Keefe for more than eight hours . By then , Keefe was in no sense a reasoning creature , nor was his snail 's progress along the littered road either a conscious matter of direction or a disciplined physical effort . The dismounted driver approached a sort of automaton , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but because some indomitable pulse of life within his mutilated body kept that hulk lurching and bucking along in spasmodic convulsions . Keefe was like a man in a late stage of dying , whose terminal shudders refused to cease ; and it was these inexplicable quivers of persistent life that propelled him along the road to Manassas . So when the driver tried to stop him , tried to get an arm around his torso , tried to get some response from him , Keefe 's body keptp269crawling on . It was not aware of the driver , nor did whatever consciousnessstill flickered within it even register the Michigan man 's exclamations . Keefe kept lunging along the road like an unspeakable mutation of agony , terror , and primeval urges to live and kill . A platoon of pickets coming off duty finally helped the driver get Keefe into the wagon ; but even as they carried him , gently as they could  --  even after he was wrapped in the driver 's own blanket on the floorboards  --  the husk of his life continued to jerk and reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manassas . The driver quickly climbed into his saddle on the near pole mule and seized the long single rein to the near leader , with which he controlled his six-mule team . " Yay up , you slat-sided hammerheads ! " The wagon was an empty that had followed Ricketts 's Division down from Thoroughfare Gap , then got lost in the dark night . Cursinghis mules lovingly , the Michigan man rattled at a trot on into Manassas , as anxious to be rid of his repulsive cargo as to get back to his outfit , wherever it was . The bouncing of the wagon on the rough road sent such excruciatingimpulses from Phil Keefe 's maimed leg to his nearly moribundbrain that they acted upon it like a deep needle into its secret centers . By the time the Michigan man delivered him to an overworkedsawbones , sleepless after two nights of duty at a field hospitalGeneral Hooker had ordered set up in the ruins of the supply depot , Keefe was not yet conscious ; but the will to live sparked feebly in his being . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Michigan man was anxious , for some reason , not to be thought associated with the filthy object he had brought in . " And do n't he stink ! " " You would , too , shape he 's in . " The sawbones peered at Keefe 's wound with interest . The Michigan man climbed back into his saddle . " Heerd ' nything'bout Ricketts 's Division ? " " Wiped out to a man . " The sawbones winked . " You the only one left to take command . " For all he knew , the way they were running the cases in on him , it could even have been true . Not far from that hospital , Reverdy Dowd was falling in the Sixth Wisconsin . New orders from Pope . Seem like there were always new orders from Pope . But for a change Dowd at least knew where the Sixth was going . After no more than two hours ' sleep , following the nightmare march to Manassas , he had set officers to work rounding up rations for thep270men , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He found none , except that some wounded had been sent in ambulancesto a hospital depot near Centreville , others to the nearest point on the 0 &; A , east of Bull Run , where trains could take them on into Alexandria . Still others were being treated in the makeshift hospitals at Bristoe and Manassas . But no one had seen Colonel Bob  --  not even Captain J. D. Black , Gibbon 's ubiquitous staff man , who had an ear for gossip and rumor , sometimes even fact , that reminded Dowd of a huge clothes hamper full of dirty linen into which an occasional clean shirt was thrown by mistake . " Hell of a horse he was riding , " Blackie said over coffee and hard biscuits at Gibbon 's headquarters cookfire . " My guess is he got himself to Centreville but what the hell . Way things were last night he could be in Timbuctoo for all I know . General says the regiment 's yourn till further notice . " Dowd was pleased but not surprised . Naturally , he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all right . But he had known in the haunted and harrowing night , and had felt all over again when he awoke among the men of the Sixth , sleeping where they had fallen in the predawn hour of their arrival at Manassas , that it was his regiment now . They all owed a lot to Colonel Bob  --  his hard camp discipline , interminable drilling , and meticulous concern for their health and morale  --  but Dowd sensed that he had taken over the regiment the way a man might put on a familiar old suit of clothes that fitted him better than anyone . " Preciate the general 's confidence . " Blackie sipped coffee loudly . They were sitting on the tongue of a wrecked limber . The smell of powder smoke , charred wood , burnt bacon , and horse droppings still hung over Manassas like fog . " Got to make do with what he 's got . Best we can figure so far , we lost above seven hundred k , w , and missing last night . Second Wisconsin lost near bout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of five hundred that had gone in . " But the boys gave as good as they got , Blackie . Mine did anyway . " He hardened himself to think of casualties as numbers , not men . Easy enough once you could n't hear their groans or see their blood or the way they sprawled in death . " So 'd they all . Good training pays off , Gibbon says . " " So then why ... " Dowd measured his words carefully . " Why not stay where we were , wait for the rest of the army to come up , and fight ' em again today ? " The sound of Sigel 's guns to the north made his blood race ; he remembered the supple feel of the Sixth responding to his commands.  |p271Blackie  looked around elaborately , as if to spot eavesdroppers . " Old King lost his bottom . Leastways that 's how I see it . But Gibbon claims he voted for retreat , too . " He tossed the remnant of his coffee into the fire . " You believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These West Pointers hang together . " " But we fought ' em down to the shuck ! " " Thing was , when we come off the field and King come to talk it over with Gibbon and the other brigadiers , we got word from Ricketts that he could n't hold Thoroughfare Gap and Longstreet 'd be coming through this morning . Gibbon says the way they figured it , if they held still they 'd of been facing Jackson and Longstreet today . Besides , the only orders King had at that time was to march to Centreville . Looked like the only way to get there was round through Manassas . " Dowd chewed over this information while Captain Black hustled off at Gibbon 's shout . Bitterly , the major reflected that Blackie probably had the right of it : King had panicked . Now here they were , out of whatever was going on over there near last night 's battleground . And if Blackie knew his beans , Longstreet was coming to join Jackson . Captain Black came hustling back , looking important ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rev. We 're going with Porter . " Porter was out of McClellan 's army . Dowd bristled immediately . " Hell , Blackie , we 're McDowell 's Corps . " " But nobody 's seen McDowell since late yesterday . That 's why King was on his own last night . " " But what are we going to do with Porter ? " " March to Gainesville . " Blackie swung into his saddle . " You want to fight so bad , that ought to suit you right down to the ground . " Sergeant Owen L. Cade of Company D , Thirteenth Georgia , was impatientwith the lack of action on Lawton 's front . Cady did not usuallypine for action , being too wise a veteran for such foolishness . He was eagerly aware that morning , however , that he was still in command of the company , all its officers having gone down the evening before , and Captain Glover , who 'd had to take over the whole regiment , being too preoccupied to recommend new company officers . When he did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more than any poor son of a one-mule tobacco farmer had a right to expect . But the Yanks were not cooperating . Real fight over to the left but not out front here . Em sons take one look at our line'n back off . Cady was lying on the front slope of the railroad cut  --  a formi/dable natural defense line from which he did not much blame the Yanks for shying away . He watched with interest as a new bluebelly regiment marched out , lined up , gave a cheer , and started up the slope toward the cut . A fancy Yank officer , dressed to the teeth , led the way on a brown horse that looked like somebody 'd shined'im up with tallow . Trimble had passed the word to hold fire until the Yanks got close enough they could smell their breath . But Cady was feeling in command of more than Company D that morning and was hot to clinch his bars . He watched the pretty major on the shining horse leading the Yank brigade up the slope toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming , proud as a house cat on his highsteppinghorse . Behind him , his regiment did n't look half so happy to come calling . Cady believed in popping off the leaders ; but when he drew a bead on the major , it was really only to keep in practice . He did n't actually plan to snuff him . But just then , the horseback major turned and waved his sword at his following troops . That was too much out of a picture book for Cady , who hated playacting . Ah shit , he thought , and squeezed the trigger . The piece bucked on his shoulder , the muzzle blast rang in his ears . The major went off the horse and lay still , blue against the broomsedge . " Christamighty , " the New Man said . " That open up'is collar button for'im . " Privates J. F ' . Sowell and Gillum Stone were a resourceful pair , hard fighters , skilled foragers , and  --  when they chose  --  adept malingerers . Since the Stonewall Brigade  --  " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the right of the line and all the action that morning was on the left and center , they had no difficulty in drifting down through the woods and onto the trampled and littered pasturesof Brawner 's farm . " They uz any webfoot'n this army I thought 'd make it thew , " Gilly said , " it uz of Lott . Smart 's he was'n lucky too . " " The wrong day . Put the sign on'im . " They tramped past Brawner 's deserted house and barn and down the slope . A few other men moved over the field  --  medical details , troops looking for fallen friends , a platoon with a wagon collecting firearms . A burial detail was digging a mass grave near the orchard . To the northeast , the noise of battle had risen to a roar ; smoke rose white against a glassy sky . Sowell and Stone walked on in the hot early sunshine , throughp273the littered broomsedge ; wild flowers , purple and yellow in the fresh morning , bloomed incongruously in the debris of battle  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dead horses , cap boxes , flung muskets . Gilly kicked aside a knapsack and a redbound book bounced from it against a saddle on what was left of a horse . Sowell picked up a dead meadowlark without a visible wound and threw it away . The stench of powder smoke , spilled blood , bloating flesh spread over the hillside like a pall ; but the two veterans scarcely noticed . The smell was as familiar to them as the feel of the muskets in their hands . " Lessee . " Sowell stopped . " We come down the hill right around here , di n't we ? " " More overt the right , I 'd say . Oughtta be easy to find ' im , at red-check shirt a-hissen . " They walked on and Sowell pointed down the hill . " Bout right down ther they uz givin us the blazes ... " His voice broke off and they stopped abruptly , staring . " Goddlemighty , " Gilly said , after awhile . The bodies lay in straight lines , as if troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waving broomsedge . At some parts of the line less than a hundred yards apart , blue and butternut lay where they had fallen in ranks as straight as a drillmaster could wish . Behind each line , more bodies were scattered patchily on the slope , mute testimony to how men may stagger or be thrown backward when struck by flying iron or lead . In the pitiless Virginia sun , the pattern of the bodies made the pattern of the battle as plain upon the earth as if a general had drawn a diagram with a stick . " You ever seen the beat-a that ? " Sowell 's question needed no answer . From far to their left , a few shells came arcing overhead , strays from the Federal center . They landed harmlessly on the ridge . Paying them no mind , Gillum Stone braced his musket butt on the ground and stared over the silent , sprawled remains of the evening battle . " One line do n't look no diffrunt from th'other'n , somehow . " " It ai nt , " Sowell said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They walked along 01 Jack 's line of dead . Most of the wounded , save a few too shattered to move , had been carried off . One or two of those remaining muttered and groaned as they passed ; one cursed them , glaring with mad bulging eyes . But most of the faces they saw were blank and stiff , the silent grimaces of death fixed upon them like Halloween masks. " 01 Busthead lyin ther , " Gilly said . " Had'is last drink . " " Our compny all right . Hyer 's Cottonmouth . Lott oughtta be right round-yore someres. "  |p274They  went on five yards , ten yards . " Mought of passed'im , " Sowell said . " You go on aways . I 'll check back . " He peered closely at scattered bodies behind that part of the front line , covering a circle about twenty-five yards in circumference . Lightless eyes stared back at him and rictus jaws exposed , here and there , gold or lead teeth to the sun . Sowell was shocked to find Greasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found no one in a red-checked shirt , no one with even the dead shadow of Lott McGrath 's horsey , grinning face or his thick yellow hair . " Sowbelly ! " Gilly 's voice , across the patches of dead , was hushed but carrying . He beckoned urgently , and Sowell , picking his way between corpses and wounded , hurried to his side . Gilly pointed to a musket lying in the broomsedge . Clear in the morning sun , Sowell could see on the worn butt the carved initials LM . " Bound to of been rightchere . " Gilly pointed to a body lying nearby , with a leg bent back under it . " Capus Warner ther . He alluz stuck near usunses . But I ai nt seen Lott yet . " They searched carefully for another five minutes , gingerly turningover the face-down dead to be sure . More errant shells from the Yank battery came over , doing no harm . The sound of gunfire rolled down shatteringly from the northeast , and the sun beat fiercely on the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around a hive . " He ai nt here , " Gilly said at last . Sowell nodded somberly and squinted at another flight of shells going over to his left . " He said it uz the wrong day , Gilly . No wonder we ai nt found'im . " Gilly stared at him , awestruck . " But I seen'im go over deader'n Capus ther . He just natchrally got to be here , Sowbelly , he ... " " Ai nt nothin natchral bout it . " Private Sowell picked up the musket marked LM . " Fightin on the wrong day . " Some distance across the hillside , near the center of what had been Jackson 's line , Andrew Peterson had finished exposing a plate with his lens pointed at a stiffly sprawled body . Peterson had no way of knowing that the corpse was that of Fargo Hart 's friend Kirk Connelly , or even that there ever had been such a person . But something in the flung-down form  --  one leg drawn up as if in climbing , the other extended full-length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistol still clutched in the dead hand  --  had caught Peterson'salert eye . The body not only looked strangely as if frozen in flight  --  which , in a sense , it was ; in its reaching posture , it alsop275seemed to Peterson to suggest pathetically the way these eager boys clutched at life while dealing in death , descended into the dark even as they grasped for the sun . " Ai nt got many mo plates , " Joe Nathan said . " This is the last one for now . " Peterson hurried for the Whatsit Wagon a few feet away , carrying the exposed plate in its shield . As he moved , flies rose from the mess that had been the back of Kirk Connelly 's head . " Bring the camera along . " " I gittin it . " Peterson had long since learned that Joe Nathan handled the equipment  --  by which he was still largely mystified  --  as lovingly as the photographer would have himself . Joe Nathan had once been the property of Peterson 's wife ; now he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he had taken over his wife 's abandoned property . Then a skinny youth , Joe Nathan had worked ever since for small wages and his keep , first as handyman at the Pantheon in Atlanta , since the war as driver and equipment handler in the field . Joe Nathan was brave , reliable , and handy ; he had rigged a foldingstep for the back of the Whatsit Wagon , so that Peterson could get to his chemicals as rapidly as possible . Over the bed of the wagon , following Mathew Brady 's well-publicized example on almost the same battlefield a year earlier , Peterson had built a wooden enclosurelined with canvas that completely shut out sunlight when the rear door was closed . The interior was fitted out as a darkroom and provided storage for plates , chemicals , and the bulky , boxlike cameraand its tripod . The biggest problem was that in summer , especially in Virginia , the Whatsit Wagon was stiflingly hot . The sun beat relentlessly on its roof and sides , turning the inside into an oven in which not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wagon that morning , he began to perspire immediately ; he felt like a chicken in a roasting pan . The tinted lanterns that provided a subdued orange glow added to the heat ; but Peterson could spare no time to fret , lest the collodioncoating on the plate dry and the silver nitrate crystallize . With practiced hands he took the exposed plate from the shield and let pyrogallic acid flow over it , careful to waste none of the scarce stuff . Then he watched the never-failing miracle , as he considered it , of the image beginning to appear , dimly at first , then rapidly becoming brilliant . In the orange light , he found himself looking again at the body of Kirk Connelly , truly frozen this time , preserved in chemical and glass forever . Peterson was too much of a professional to linger in admirationp276over his own work , and too accustomed to war to pause long in contemplation of its excrescences Quickly he washed the plate in water  --  warm enough , in the heat of the Whatsit Wagon , to shave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the developed plate to rid it of any remaining silver salts . After giving the plate a more complete bath in the warm N ater , he held it near the hot lantern , moving it rapidly in the air to dry ; then he varnished the plate and the job was done . He looked at the image briefly , once again . Good . Worth keeping . Carefully he stored the plate away in the filing racks Joe Nathan guarded like treasure . Well , those plates were treasure ; there was truth in them . In some of them arlywaPeterson blew out the lantern opened the door , and sprang to the ground , ignoring the folding stair in his haste to be out of the bake-oven interior . Even in the direct sun , it was far cooler outside . Joe Nathan leaned against a rear wheel , the catuera cradled in his arms like a child . " Some fight over thataway . " He nodded tow and the smoke rollingwhitely into the sky . " Oh . . . sure is . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surroundings ; he had hardly noticed the rising crack of gunfire . So Pope did come , he thought , just like the Britisher said he would . Shells were coming closer to $rawner 's , too , though there was no evidence of infantry activity nearby . Down the slope to the pike , up it past the farmhouse and barn to the woods , the morning was hot , brilliant , still . Only a few men moved like ragpickers along the straight lines of dead , and the burial detail was still at work near the orchard . Flies swarmed everywhere " Let 's get up under the trees'n cool off . " Stray shells made Petersonuneasy . Gunfire in battle was targeted , more or less predictable ; but batteries firing for practice , or to harass , could be as randomas fate . Joe Nathan loaded the camera into the wagon and secured it to the brackets prepared for it . Then he mounted the high front seat . " Hum-up , mules ! " Peterson walked ahead , toward his horse tethered in the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished , he resolutely turned his back on 01 Jack 's littered battlefield . Nothing he could do about it ; nothing anyone could do about it . But the treasure of glass plates in the Whatsit Wagon could at least record the truth of it  --  the waste and destruction and senselessness , the absence of glory . His long linen duster was draped over his saddle as he had left it . Peterson took a cigar and matches from its pocket , lit up , and satp277under a tree while Joe Nathan brought the wagon into the shelter of the woods and tethered the mules  --  Positive and Negative , one light , one dark . " Hot . " Joe Nathan sat down facing him , about ten feet away , his back against a large oak tree . " Do n't evuh seem to git dis hot'n Jawjuh . " " How many more plates you say we got left ? " Peterson cocked his head to the sound of another shell straying in their general direction . " I make it maybe ... " But Peterson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the suddenly rising scream of the stray , and because he had heard enough of battle to sense that this stray was coming directly at them . Peterson dived for the earth , trying to throw himself around and behind his tree , going as flat as he could , his arms instinctively around his head . From the corner of his eye , as he went down , he saw Joe Nathan stiffening against the tree that sheltered him , his lips pulled back stiffly over teeth startlingly white in his ebony face . With his nose in pine straw , Peterson heard the whock of the ball striking a tree , like a giant 's axe . The scream died abruptly and something burned his cheek ; but he held still , tense against the ground , waiting for splinters or fragments to rend his body , a tree to fall on him , darkness coming down . He was not conscious of fear . In a second , he realized he was unhit , unhurt , except for the cigar ash burning the side of his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hell of a way to get a scar , he thought . Then he checked the Whatsit Wagon ; the mules were rearing in fright but the wagon and its cargo were safe . " Close , " he said out loud . But Joe Nathan did not answer . He was still propped against the broad trunk of the oak , his clenched fists on his thighs , his shoulders hunched a little , as if drawn in for shelter . Above his shoulders , Peterson saw , there was nothing except a round , clean opening , like a ship 's porthole , in the tree trunk . Peterson never did find Joe Nathan'shead . Duryea had reached Sigel with no difficulty and delivered Pope 's orders forcefully . The German general did not remonstrate or send word back asking for reinforcements , and soon after daybreak his guns began to thunder  --  three batteries firing from a rise of ground near the crossroads at Groveton . But it seemed to Duryea a long time before skirmishers began creeping forward , he thought reluctantly ,  |p278under  cover of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced slowly , as if searching for wild strawberries . Their pace slackened when they encountered Reb resistance north of the pike . Duryea worked his way to the right toward Bull Run , behind Sigel 's front . To his eye , the blue troops crawling northward did not seem sufficiently aggressive ; nor did their officers appear to be pushing them . But Duryea was even more disturbed by his growing conviction that Pope had been wrong again . He could see no evidence that the Rebs were retreating , as the general supposed . The volume of artilleryfire when their guns finally opened from the ridge , the number of skirmishers deployed to meet Sigel 's leisurely attack , suggested that Jackson 's men were dug in and full of fight . Duryea wanted to make certain of that before returning to Pope 's headquarters . Micah G. Duryea was a loyal soldier and a strong Union man , but he was beginning to lose confidence in John Pope 's judgment . This new demonstration that the general , for all his ability to react quickly and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded Duryea of the order to McDowell that had opened Thoroughfare Gap to any relief column Lee might have sent to Jackson . On the horizon now , as he moved along the Sudley Springs Road behind the slow  --  too slow  --  advance of General Carl Schurz , on Sigel'sright , Duryea could see the blue rise of the Bull Run Mountains . Far over to his left , a notch in the skyline marked Thoroughfare Gap . Duryea wished he knew what , if anything , was happening there . Because if he was right and Jackson was not retreating but standing fast , then Stonewall was bound to believe that help was on the way through that notch in the hazy distance . Teddy Redmund , conspicuous in his havelock but not in his movements , had taken post early that morning not far from a line of sixteen Confederate cannon placed on Sudley Mountain behind the left of Jackson 's infantry lines . The booming guns and the shells screaming away from their muzzles were deafening , and the Federal batteries near the pike were sending back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional soldier , despite his journalist 's guise ; after the first few rounds , he hardly noticed the noise or his own exposure . In his correspondent 's function , moreover , the Englishman had taught himself to ignore trivial details like noise and smoke and the deaths of men , to concentrate instead on the main lines of a battle 's development . The articles of Sertorius thus conveyed little of thep279blood and terror of battle but had won an admiring audience among military men and drawing-room generals in his own country . They found Sertorius 's descriptions of troop movements and gun positions and turning points and tactical moves clear and detailed , even when these represented events that ought to have taken place , rather than those that actually had happened . If this approach to war reporting sometimes made Sertorius 's accounts of battles clearer and more logical to readers than the fightingever had been to the officers and men engaged in it , that was precisely what Teddy Redmund wanted  --  indeed , what seemed to him proper . He believed it necessary to translate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembling the kind of patterned warfare to which he and other European students of the military arts were accustomed . How else could anyone make sense of such a loosely jointed war ? Up that morning at first light , Redmund had been surprised that the Federal force that had stood up to Jackson in the evening fight had moved out . Not a sign of it but its wounded and dead left on the field . Unsoldierly , that . He had rather thought that it would be Jacksonwho would have decamped , after having given Pope such clear but foolish notice of his whereabouts . But Redmund was not shaken in his conviction that Pope now would come down on Jackson 's divisions with all the force he could muster . Never get another such opportunity , Redmund reasoned . So after the guns began to crash and growl on Jackson 's left , where Hill 's Division was posted , Redmund had lost little time in finding a good vantage point and breaking out his excellent English field glasses . Before long it became clear to him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Jackson 's and Hill 's extreme left  --  the latter apparently commanded by the rather rude young general who had nevertheless tacitly allowed him to follow Hill 's Division from Centreville . Arnold , Redmund had noted down at the time . Brigadier Arnold . That officer had a reasonably strong flank position , Redmund decided ; but the ground he held was so limited and the regiments so packed into it that Redmund feared he would have trouble distinguishingtheir movements . And the look of the gap between Arnold and the next brigade to the right was ugly ; so were the woods that rolled right up to the defense line at that point , giving good cover to an attack . Redmund had already conceded to himself that the floundering Jackson had at least had the sense or luck to set himself up rather nicely behind the old railway construction , with his guns elevated  |p280u|p  for the senseless attack of the evening before . And somebody 's head should roll for the gap in the front , to the right of Brigadier Arnold . The morning wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , Redmund thought . But the sounds of their advance moved steadily , if slowly , nearer . At about half past ten , just as the volume of fire and the returning butternut skirmishers indicated that the blues were about to fall on him at last , Brigadier Arnold made a surprisingly good move . With the force of an artillery blast , the regiment that went yelling over the railroad cut ran head-on into the blue battle line coming cautiously through the trees . Bloody good counterstroke . But even with his glasses , Redmund could not make out , through the battle smoke and the obscuring trees and underbrush , much of what happened next . He could reasonably suppose , however , that the surprise charge and the force with which the butternut regiment had gone in had caused the blues to give way . The musketry from the woods crashed incessantly . Muzzle flashes stabbed through the smoke like sparks from a chimney . And after a few minutes , Redmund began to see wounded men straggling out of the woods , some crawling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the backs of other butternuts , their line irregular , just within the woods . Pushed back , he thought . Blues rallied in the woods . Just then Brigadier Arnold , apparently getting the same impression , moved again . A regiment that had crouched at the foot of the cut sprang up and ran for the woods , yelling barbarously . They angledto the left of the first butternut regiment , and Redmund reckoned  --  ashe clinically observed pieces being moved on the battlefieldchessboard  --  that the original Reb charge had caught the blues in center and on their left , forcing that part of their line back but allowing the blue right to swing around like a cracking whip on the left flank of the butternuts . Which would have been why their attack had been halted and pushed back . And why Brigadier Arnold had launched his second stroke against the right of the blues . Bloody Arnold appeared to have steady nerves . Lying flat on the slope of the railroad cut , Josh Beasly was mad as a wet tomcat . It was not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he strutted around behind , there 'd be little chance to get a spot on the bastard . But as the second regiment went forward , one of the goddam South Carolina crackers had stepped down with a plundered Yank brogan squarely on Josh 's left hand . Like to mash it flat . The hand hurt so bad he was no longer sure he could hold his barrel steady.  |p281Josh  hardly noticed , in his pain and anger , that the South Carolinians , falling in on the Tar Heel regiment 's left as if they 'd been one line all along , turned the tide again . But Corporal Amos Gilmore , standing not far from General Arnall out in front of the railroad cut , whooped as the Yank line , which had come surging back after the first counterattack , began to give way a second time . Gilmore thought he 'd never heard hotter firing . Corporal Gilmore stole a quick look over his brawny shoulder to make sure the boy was all right , back there with General Arnall 's horse . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sight now as the Yanks gave ground  --  just as Hoke Arnall began to yell orders to Colonel Dixon . Sam Stowe , his own regiment alert but unengaged along the fence , was balancing himself precariously on its top rail , unmindful in his planter 's hat of the Minie balls whining over the embankment . He had watched admiringly and with not a little state pride as McCrary 's South Carolina regiment bowled into the Yankee right just beyond the edge of the woods . South Carolina boys could whip a cattywhompus barehanded . Too bad , however , the action was over there , rather than in front of his own angle of Arnall 's flank position . But as Arnall said , sooner or later the Yanks were bound to try it across the cornfield . They were certainly catching the devil in those woods . Just then , Dixon 's Rifles , too , surged over the top of the railroad cut , howling like banshees , and lunged for the woods . That Arnall , Stowe thought in admiration . Perfect timing . Might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above , Redmund , too , noted that Brigadier Arnoldhad thrown this new punch at just the moment when the blues were reeling back . Equally important , he had put the third regiment in on the right of the original counterattack , extending a solid battle line all across his front . Redmund cursed the trees and the smoke , for once letting annoying details impede his concentration on positionand maneuver . Foxy Bradshaw was thanking his stars for those same trees , and ducking behind every one he came to , for as long as he could . He knew he was about to lose his whole works any minute now . On either side of him the men of his company were blasting away , but Foxy had not fired a shot since skulking out of the shelter of the embankment . He stepped over men sprawled on the ground as if they were mere logs in his path . But he knew all too well that they were men like himself with peters and stones  --  men shot in every part of ' the body , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a hole where the nose had been , or a blank red splotch for an eye , or a gaping cavity for a crotch. 0 law me Foxy thought , over and over . 0 law me I ai nt comin outta these woods . Not whole I ai nt o law me . His racing brain functioned with awful clarity , telling him to drop in his tracks , fake a broken leg or maybe a toe , but then remindinghim that the woods might catch fire from hot lead and powder blasts . He could not face the pain of shooting himself in the foot or the hand . If he turned tail , Ironass would have him shot or hung for sure . Best thing is , go along . Duck behind trees . Far a shot ever now'n then , git my bar'l hot . But o law me I 'm a dead man soon . Dead or undone . Even in his terror , however , Foxy noticed that the Yanks were going back fast . Somewhere ahead of him Lige Flournoy trotted along almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trotting on , then stopping to fire again . The din of muskets going off and the yelling of the men all around him were so loud that Lige could hardly hear his own shots ; but he could feel his piece kick against his shoulder , comforting as a slap on the back . He had a small chaw of tobacco , Yank issue plundered at Manassas and just big enough to raise spit . It kept his mouth from going dry with the yelling and the smoke . Bullets whistled back at Lige but he was unconcerned . He had a veteran 's sense that this was just a skirmish to get things started . Time enough to worry when the buttin'n gougin started . He dropped to one knee , fired , and reloaded . Just as he capped his musket , Lige saw through a rift in the smoke a blue uniform dash from behind a tree . Lige pulled his hammerto full cock and drew down on the running figure . But as his finger began to tighten on the trigger , the target veered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lige still would have had time to drop him but his eye caught a flash of gold on the left shoulder . Lige rose and trotted on . He never shot at an officer , except one who was about to shoot at him . " Alluz kill'em at 's most like to kill you , " he had instructed Foxy after Mechanicsville . " Kill privates , Meat , you gone kill anybody . " Just inside the southern fringe of the woods through which the Yanks were being driven , Charlie Keach crouched behind a tree , taking notes . Riding toward the scene of the night action as early as he could , he had found Schurz 's troops moving and followed them closely , noting that Alexander Schimmelfennig 's Brigade was on the right and that of Wladimir Krzyzanowski  --  in Keach 's notes , KRZ  --  wasp283on the left . Keach thought the Germans had gone in with spirit and determination , and he was as surprised as they when the Rebs counterattackedinto the woods . He had made quick time back through the trees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McClellan up the Peninsula and been in the thick of the action at Fair Oaks . After his newspaper colleagues first got a look at him there , Crounse of the World had said to Townsend of the Herald : " That feller 'd as lief go under fire as walk into an oyster house . " Mostly because of Keach 's eagerness and his appetite for combat , Hale  --  his paper 's Washington bureau chief  --  had pulled him off the Peninsula and sent him out with Pope 's Army of Virginia . Hale , as usual , had chosen astutely ; unlike the Peninsula , which had swarmed with correspondents assigned to McClellan , the Young Napoleon , Pope 's Virginia campaign was going to be Charlie Keach 's story alone . He did not aim to miss it . He watched Schurz 's brigades giving ground back through the woods , noting many of the details for which Teddy Redmund had so little use  --  a private sitting against a persimmon tree , holding his intestines in his hands ; a horse boltingfor the rear , dragging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Damn fool asked for it , going through woods on horseback . Keach had about decided to get moving again , since the Rebs obviously were going to clear the woods , when a cheer went up behind him , just audible above the continuous musketry and the Rebs ' infernal yelling . Odd how Rebs yelled and Federals cheered . That told Keach something but he was not sure what . Just then , off to Keach 's right , a regiment KRZ must have been holding in reserve dashed into the woods , between the two blue brigades that had made the first attack . Keach saw the new unit  --  identified by its colors as a New York outfit  --  stop , go down to one knee , aim ; then , as if a single current of electricity had discharged every man 's musket at once , the Yorkers poured a deafening volley into the smoke and confusion ahead of them . If they had Rebs in their sights , Keach thought , they ai nt there now . Indeed , the reinforcement in the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on either side . Over his shoulder , moreover , Keach could see two more blue regiments forming a battle line . He had no idea where they had come from but he let out an unjournalistic whoop . Damn Rebs not having everything their way today , by God . Four miles east , on a hill just outside Centreville , Captain Duryea was reporting to General Pope and his staff . But before telling ColonelRussell that in his opinion Schurz 's Germans were not pursuingp284retreating secesh troops but had stumbled against dug-in Rebs spoilingfor a fight , Duryea had had a swift panoramic glimpse of the battle scene visible from the Centreville heights . He could plainly make out , beyond the lush tree line bordering Bull Run , the white clouds rising from batteries behind both lines , the thinner smoke of small-arms fire rising above the treetops in between . Blue troops , in a steady impressive stream , were flowing westward along the pike toward the sound of guns rumbling like angry subterranean gods across the low hills of Virginia . But what had caught Duryea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dust cloud against the blue rise of the Bull Run Mountains . It stretched straight from the notch he knew to be Thoroughfare Gap toward where he reckoned Gainesville was . As he turned to look for Colonel Russell , Micah Duryea did not have to guess which troops those were , hurrying toward the battlefield Pope had chosen on the plains of Manassas . Fargo Hart was watching the same dust cloud . Followed at a respectabledistance by Brace on his mare and Henry bareback on a mule he handled as if it were a child 's pony , Hart was trotting crosscountrytoward the Hay Market Road in search of General J.E.B. Stuart . He was uncomfortable to be in such company but , having committed himself , he felt he had no choice but to go through with his promise . A gentleman did what he said he would . Hart did not ask himself whether he was influenced by the fact that the unprepossessingBrace was Missy 's father ; he had put that firmly out of his mind . Hart had spent too much of the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reasoned , was bound to be rising above Longstreet 's relief column ; and he felt sure Stuart would be riding in that direction . And before long , Stuart did come trotting west along the Hay Market Road at the head of a cavalry regiment . The young general , his long beard flying like a pennant , gave Hart a cheery salute as he passed . The captain fell in stirrup-to-stirrup with Colonel Snowden , letting Brace and Henry fend for themselves . Snowden pointed to the dust cloud out to their right . " Just in time , Hart ! " " Looks like it . " All morning , Hart had been listening to the rising clatter of battle to the east , on the left of Jackson 's line . As he had the afternoon before , he sensed in the distant sounds a circle closing , somethingdecisive drawing nearer ; and he had been bothered , as the day grew hot and humid and the dust rose from the country lanes inp285choking clouds , by the knowledge that he wanted to return to Missy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ring of decision tightening around him , the need to break through it to Missy  --  Hart had never before felt his sense of self , of his place in the great pigeonhole desk , so uncertain . The duality of his attitude toward the war  --  his reluctance to let himself become part of it , as against his sense that his place was in it  --  had found its expression in his yearning for a child-woman whose sudden intrusionupon his consciousness was as implausible as it was irresistible . Stuart soon called a halt . He had scouts out on both flanks and in front ; he wanted another trailing on the left , in case Federal cavalaryalso might be moving from the pike to check that dust out toward Thoroughfare . Hart seized the opportunity , rode forward , and saluted again . His shirt was drenched and clinging with sweat , and he felt the sun on the back of his neck like heat from a low fire . " Gin'al . . . local farmer and his darky ridin with me . Say they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts pretty well , do they ? " Stuart craned his neck for a sight of the volunteers , who were coming slowly past his halted troops . " I 'd say so , sir . Brace  --  that 's the farmer  --  been livin herebouts nearly twenty years . The darky do n't say much , but I take that as a good sign . " " Let 's have a look at ' em . " Brace came up grinning and ducking , giving a travesty of a salute . Hart cringed , but Stuart in his hearty fashion started right in asking questions about the roads and streams ; and Brace quickly showed that he knew the area intimately . He even climbed down and began sketching in the dirt a map of the tangle of woods and paths in the triangle between Groveton , Gainesville , and Manassas . " Look like he might do , Hart . Even got a decent mare there . " Hart did not tell the general that the decent mare was limping on a foreleg . That was not the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father than for the strong-faced buck . Henry had warned Brace that the mare should n't be ridden ; and Hart liked a man , black or white , who cared about horses . " All right , Brace , reckon I can use you . Snowden ! Send a trooper back with Brace and his man there . Find Gin'al Robertson and tell ' im to send out these here volunteers with any scoutin parties or other details south of the pike . Seem to know their way aroun down there . " Colonel Snowden looked with distaste at Brace 's gaunt and tatteredfigure climbing back on the mare ; but he led Brace and Henryp286back to the ranks and called out an escort . The last Hart saw of them , as he rode on just behind Stuart , they were headed back the other way . Teddy Redmund , still patiently charting chessboard moves and counterstrokes from his post near the guns in Hill 's rear , had detectedfrom the increased volume of musket fire that the blues had been reinforced , somewhere on the far side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been interested to know that the added blue troops  --  the two regiments Charlie Keach had welcomed so volubly  --  haddouble-timed from the center of the line Sigel had stretched from the turnpike at Groveton northeast to the Sudley Springs Road . These regiments , at Schurz 's request , had been moved to the right to shore up Schurz 's attack through the woods . If Redmund had known that , it would have given him a useful piece of information about the chessboard Sertorius would later have to describe  --  that Sigel was neither pressing hard nor hard-pressed in the center . The morning 's fight was on Jackson 's left . But not much could be seen , except the smoke drifting above the trees and the wounded straggling back from the woods and into Brigadier Arnold 's line . Business appeared brisk at a field surgery near Sudley Church . Josh Beasly could not see much either , even within those woods gloomy with powder smoke that shut out what sunlight might ordinarilyhave filtered through the trees . But he could tell from the muzzle flashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front were now too many to hold off . With a veteran 's sensitivity to his flanks , he knew also that on either side of him Dixon 's Rifles were giving way , making the Yanks pay for every yard but pulling back toward the railroad cut . Josh was moving back with them , taking as much cover as he could , ignoring wet-eared officers yelling at them to hold fast . Fuck that shit . And he had a real reason , that day , to keep his skin whole . Off to his right , Josh saw Foxy Bradshaw jumping from tree to tree . Gutless little prick . Bet ' is barl 's cold as a witch 's tit . But Josh was too wise in the ways of battle to let the likes of Foxy  --  or even his aching , bruised hand  --  take his mind off his business , which was staying alive and snuffing Yanks . Bracing his piece against a tree , he got a good line on a Yank trotting forward bent low , as if the musket in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tree helping his bruised hand hold the piece steady , and saw the Yank straighten up abruptly , his cap flying off . Like he run up on a closeline crost ' is thoat . But Joshp287did not linger to see the Yank totter to the side , drop his musket , clutch his arms around a tree , and sag to his knees . Josh had seen too many such sights ; they no longer thrilled him . Sam Stowe , still holding the rail fence against nothing but shimmeringemptiness , heard the musket fire coming back through the woods once more , and sent a courier running to Hoke Arnall . " Colonel Stowe 's compli'nts ... speckfully minds you his reg ' - ment 's rarin to go . " Arnall was striding along the top of the cut with his pistol strapped to his side and his ear attuned  --  like a musician 's to his instrument 's pitch  --  to the ebb and surge of the fighting in the woods . He had made up his mind to throw in Stowe when the moment came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember the open field that lay on the army 's flank . He had already sent a message to Hill to have a regiment from the division reserve ready to move behind the fence , in the unlikely event that the Yanks were adept enough to turn his flank while striking the front . But Arnall had never seen blue troops manage that well . " Tell Colonel Stowe to hold himself ready ! " Above the din from the woods , even Arnall 's battlefield voice could barely make the words audible . His throat was dry from yellingand from the acrid smoke that hung thick and grainy in the air ; the sun seared the sky like a great torch , blearily red through the haze . But the General felt himself strong , confident , in charge ; he knew what to do . And he felt more strongly than ever that his hour , the opportunity he had wanted , really was at hand . Arnall called Gilmore to his side with a wave . He put his lips an inch from the corporal 's ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas , next brigade on the right . Tell ' im if my force gets pushed near this edge of the woods , I 'll send in another regiment ' n try to drive these people all the way out . If he sees a chance to hit ' em , that 'd be the time . Got that ? " Gilmore nodded and started to turn away , saluting . But Arnall grabbed his arm . " Say it back ! " " They push us to the edge-a the woods , you 're sendin in another reg'ment . He sees a chancet , hit'em at the same time . " No way to fight a battle without men like Gilmore to get the job done . Arnall watched the strapping corporal ducking and dashing along the gap between his sector and Thomas 's Brigade . Why did n't Hill close that gap ? But before Arnall could get off another warning , the firing fromp288the woods and the numbers of his men falling back into the cover of the railway line regained his attention . Almost time to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat where Stowe was perched on the rail fence watching him , and signaled with his arm for the South Carolinians to wheel from the rail-fence front to the bottom of the cut . Teddy Redmund immediately spotted the movement of Arnall 's last regiment . Throwing in everything . Took bloody courage . But the correspondentwas doubtful it was the right thing to do . The oncoming blues obviously were driving hard . If they shifted to their right , or if there were more blues beyond the cornfield . . . Redmund swung his glasses in that direction . No movement . No sun glinting on metal , no hint of dust , nothing but the glazy , empty heat hanging above the ploughed field like a reflection off water . Brigadier Arnold had the odds with him , Redmunddecided ; at least even . Charlie Keach , advancing behind Schurz 's reinforced line at a more respectful pace than he had maintained in the earlier movement forward , just then met one of KRZ 's Yorkers lurching out of the line , his left arm entirely gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cleaver . Odd , Keach thought . There had been little shellfire into the woods from either side , since the cannoneers could not be sure they were n't firing into their own men . The sleeve of the Yorker 's jacket had been sheared off with his arm and Keach could see the torn end of his shirt sleeve , the edges of which appeared to have been sucked or blasted into the red maw of the wound . Maybe a saber , Keach thought . But no cavalry in the woods either . Just then the man pitched forward on his face and lay still , without sound or shudder . Keach carefully noted down the oddity and went on , moving from tree to tree . War , Hale had told him to begin with , was full of inexplicable horrors . Suddenly , up ahead , he could see what looked like the edge of the woods . That meant the Reb counterattack not only had been halted but the secesh had been driven for a change . That felt good . Trample the bastards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Hoke Arnall , his huge pistol out of the holster and reassuringin his hand , was just then sending Sam Stowe 's fresh regiment of South Carolinians into the woods . At that signal , and just as thep289first of KRZ 's blue troops became visible through the woods to the men on the Reb front line , Colonel Edward Thomas loosed two Georgiaregiments , whooping and firing , on KRZ 's left flank . Like a butternutavalanche , the three new Reb regiments surged down on the tired Yanks , many of whom had been loading and firing all that hot forenoon . The most exhausted Federal units had three times crossed the smoke-misted woods now carpeted with torn bodies and battle litter  --  and every step of the way , backward or forward , they had been under fierce fire from Arnall 's riflemen . Those battlefield veterans , needing little direction from officers mostly less experienced than they , let the fresh butternuts take the lead , then fell in step with the shock wave that swiftly sent the Yanks reeling back . Only a few walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fight drifted back to the cover of the railroad cut , risking Ironass 's threatening pistol . Foxy Bradshaw , having long since had enough , dropped craftily on his face at the edge of the woods and lay sprawled in a stain of someone else 's blood . He was unscathed by so much as a singed eyebrow from the sparking of the few caps he had popped , but Foxy was not going back into those woods full of death and dismemberment . He had his mind made up and his story ready . 0 law me got to git gone from this army fore I 'm hogmeat . Lige Flournoy and Josh went forward with the new butternut tide . Its first shock halted the Yanks ; in less than a minute , it had them moving backward ; in three it broke them and sent them runningagain through the vaporous woods , not in good order or taking toll as they went but-to Charlie Keach 's profanely shouted disgust  --  running for life before the oncoming yelling Rebs . Even battle veterans can only take so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repulse at what had seemed a moment of victory  --  the shock of suddenness  --  rattles troops more profoundly than fire on their flank . The battlefield is not , after all , a chessboard , even one with humanpieces  --  as perhaps men like Lige and Josh , even Foxy , knew better than Redmund or Keach . Battle does not merely pit men against men , or even men against the eyeless indifference of Minie and shell . The battlefield is the ultimate arena of man against himself . And it is within themselves that troops break , as Schurz 's men finally did that morning in the dark and devouring woods . But Theodore Alford St. John Redmund only wondered , as he watched what he knew from the battle din was the rout of the blues , why the Federal humbler in command  --  surely it could n't have been Pope ?  --  had neither concentrated enough force in Brigadier Arnold 's front nor turned his flank across the cornfield.  |p290For  his part , as he stood exuberantly on the lip of the cut , Hoke Arnall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sound management of his forces , good timing and  --  he was vain enough to think  --  considerable daring . Let 01 Jack put that in his pipe and smoke it ! Arnall knew Hill would have high praise for him in the division report . As if to confirm that anticipation , a courier from division gallopedin with a note for Arnall , scribbled in pencil on the back of a requisition form . But the words were not what Arnall expected : Gen'l ArnallGen'l Jackson does not wish to bring on bigger engagemt till Gen'l Longst arrives . Withdraw to railway line . HillLarkin Folsom , coming forward with a dipper of Sudley Church well water for the general , saw him shove his revolver in his holster and stamp a booted foot in anger . Past him and over the woods , Folsom could see through the curling smoke the red unblinking eye of the sun . Just short of noon , the boy figured , the worst of the heat still ahead , and Ironass already in a bobcat mood . As he rode with Stuart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dust cloud moving down from Thoroughfare until there was little doubt in his mind that Longstreet was only a few minutes away . " Or else , " Colonel Snowden joked , " Lincoln 's movin'is whole army in from the west . " When they turned at Hay Market into the road from Gainesville to Thoroughfare , the eager Stuart , unable to restrain himself any longer , signaled his staff officers ; they galloped toward the approachingdust , leaving the regimental escort at ease in a grove of pecan trees . Hart welcomed the swift ride ; it was cooling for him and gave Mercury a chance to stretch himself . He had to hold the powerful black in to keep from pulling ahead of the general and the rest of the staff . The Reverend Major Allen , scab running blackly down his forehead and nose , leaned from his saddle toward Hart and shouted . Hart caught only a few phrases and those more by expectation than by hearing : " ... army together ... work of the Lord ! " Hart eyed with distaste the buffalo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that represented the Lord 's work , maybe there was something to be said for the Devil . But he only smiled a bit grimly and galloped after Stuart . Around a turn in the road , they met General Lee himself  --  appearing suddenly out of the dust , his beard and uniform and horse laden with it , his face and eyes as calm as those of a monument , his erect figure on his great gray mount as reassuring as a battle flag glimpsed through powder smoke . With characteristic consideration , the Old Man was riding a hundred yards or so ahead of Longstreet 's main column , to lessen the effect of his escorts ' dust on the troops . " Oh , by God ! " Colonel Snowden could hardly contain himself , as Stuart and Lee exchanged salutes . " Now we 'll show Pope a thing or two ! " Hart had seen the commanding general on numerous occasions , but he thought Lee had never appeared so impressive  --  or so welcome  --  asthat morning on the rutted road from Thoroughfare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one or two of his staff officers hurrying forward . There was no mistaking 01 Pete , that square body solid as a caisson . As different from Jackson as beer from champagne  --  no , nothing liquid or fizzy about either general . As different as a bear from a mountain lion ; put it that way . When Longstreet 's group came up , the three generals trotted on toward Gainesville , their staffs falling in behind , uncomplaining of their superiors ' dust . " You want to even make a guess ... " Colonel Snowden had to shout above the beat of hooves . " Why of bigmouth Pope let'em through the Gap without a fight ? " " Stupidity . " Coke Mowbray never credited Yanks with anything better than that , or maybe cowardice . " Never thought Longstreet 'd come up so fast . " And neither did I , Hart thought . 01 Pete was not noted for speed . " No , sir ! " The Reverend Major 's voice boomed like a twelvepounder . " That wo n't do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand in this ! " Just short of Gainesville , Lee and Stuart left the road , dismountedand sat down in the shade of an oak tree . Longstreet , with his aides , rode on southeast toward the road 's junction with the pike . Hart and the other staff officers watched the generals under the tree conferring over Stuart 's map . The first ranks of Hood 's Texans began to go by on the road , wreathed in dust ; when they recognized Lee and Stuart , they cheered like schoolboys . The cheers could not he heard , of course , as far away as the right of Jackson 's line along the old railway . But there , as they listened top292the battle sounds from Hill 's front in the opposite direction , officers and men had been watching the approach of that tantalizing dust cloud for most of the morning . Had to be Longstreet . That was the consensus . But was it really ? Was there some chance Pope had managed to bottle up 01 Pete beyond the mountains ... that those were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Wher 'd em blackhatfellers git to , what put up at goldurn fight last evnin ? When it was clear that , whoever the newcomers were , they were closing in on Jackson 's right , General Starke , who had succeeded the wounded Taliaferro in command of Jackson 's old division , decided to settle matters . He had at hand Captain Thad Selby , just sent by Jackson to ascertain what Starke knew of the approaching troops . Starke , who was all but certain they had to be Longstreet 's , sent Selby to the pike to make sure . Selby kept well up the hillside , away from the pike . That morning he was an unsettled young man . He could not help remembering the battle of the day before  --  how different the actuality of death , the flame and litter of the field , had been from the glories he had foolishly anticipated . His head still ached from the thunder of it , echoed by the morning clash on Jackson 's left flank . Or did it ache because  --  he was honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to panicking in his first exposure to battle ? No , face it  --  to danger . Earlier that morning as he had ridden with Jackson 's staff party , he had watched with admiration as a blue-clad major on horseback led his troops boldly toward the butternut line . The Yank attack at that point , on Lawton 's front , had not been pressed . But the major made a fine figure on his glistening brown horse ; the regiment behind him looked threatening in its full blue ranks ; and as he turned to wave on his men with a sword from which sunlight reflected brilliantly , Selby thought : That 's how it ought to be . Out of the railroad cut just ahead of the staff group , a single shot rang out , from a regiment that had been holding fire under old General Trimble 's orders . The splendid blue major toppled from his horse and lay still ; the horse trotted smartly off to the rear . " Oh , too bad ! " Selby hardly realized he had spoken . He gazed intently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he saw his own hope and innocence lying there . " Too bad ! " " No , Captain . " A soft , rather high-pitched voice spoke from just behind him . 01 Jack sat his horse not three feet away , looking too at the fallen major . " We must kill the brave ones . They lead on the others . " As if to prove the point , Trimble 's men made short work of thep293fallen major 's regiment , and it soon trotted away to cover . So Selby asked himself , too , as he rode alone to the far right of Jackson 's line am I not to be one of the brave ones that lead on the others ? He would never before have dreamed of the question , much less worried about the answer . Now he felt himself ever so subtly tightening the reins on Jeff D. , the dream of the night before insistent in his consciousness ; could that wild , remembered gallop , taking him ever more swiftly toward nothingness , have been an omen for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a hidden hillside perch , got a good look at the battle flags and regimental colors crowding along the pike from Gainesville , self-doubt and apprehensionvanished . He lingered only long enough to be certain , then wheeled Jeff D. and gave him his lead  --  realizing in the horse 's great speed , and in the exhilaration of what he had to report , that the dream of the night before was coming true in a way that mocked his forebodings . He was just within earshot of Starke 's lines when he waved his hat and began to shout : " It 's Longstreet . . . Longstreet 's here ! " And even before he had the last words out , the troops on that end of the line had taken up the news , and the word rolled down Starke 's front from company to company , regiment to regiment , like summer rain moving steadily over a parched field : It 's Longstreet . . . Longstreet 's come Longstreet 's here !  |p294When  Pettigrew tapped at the door , Amy and Bess were working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , then the General 's office  --  recently fitted out as a " sewing factory . " Pettigrew 's tap was not at all apologetic , either for the smells that clung to him or for his interruption of their work . " Yes , Pettigrew . " " Needs to speak wif Bess . " Typically , Pettigrew did not call Amy " Mistis , " as most of them did , or anything at all . " Go ahead , then . " Amy spoke civilly but she was annoyed at the interruption . Owingto the tightening Federal blockade , the pinch of inadequate supplieswas beginning to be felt all through the South that summer . Everywhere in the Confederacy , plantations were becoming food rather than cotton or tobacco producers , as well as manufactories for items no longer available from Europe or the North  --  clothing , for example , particularly for the Africans , and leather , salt , soap , coffee , tea , dyes . Before the war , the spinning wheel and the loom had long been out of use at Sycamore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implements , since custom and necessity required both a spring and a fall issue of clothing for the people in the yard . A numberof the older black women remembered well enough how to spin , and they could teach others . Looms required more expertise and muscle , so some of the men helped with the weaving . Traditional folk craft produced dyes from roots and barks , elderberries and walnuthulls . Amy , closely assisted by Bess , personally supervised the cutting and the sewing of the resulting homespun and home-dyed cloth  --  tasks that called for the highest skill and which caused the most waste if botched . In the airy sewing factory at the rear of the house , the two women were preparing that August for the fall issue of heavy clothing . When the job reached its peak , they would have perhaps ap295dozen of the women from the yard engaged with needle and thread ; but Amy and Bess did most of the cutting themselves  --  a matter of efficiency , but also , Amy had realized , a sensible means of keeping control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scissors could be weapons . When Pettigrew came in from the makeshift tannery about noon , Amy and Bess were cutting from patterns for children 's jackets . They knew the driver had come from the tannery because he smelled of it . After it became clear that store-bought shoes were not going to be available for the people that winter , Amy had sought out detailed instructions for home tanning in Southern Field and Fireside magazine . Then she copied out the instructions and read them to Pettigrew , pretending they had come in a letter from the General . Pettigrew had sniffed and sneered a little but with his usual diligence and competence organized the work at once . It turned out to be a malodorous business  --  particularly making bate from hen dung . But there was no help for it ; bate was needed to wash off the lime used to remove hair from the hides . Now , smelling strongly of lye and bate and the hides themselves , Pettigrew stood silently and  --  Amy thought  --  sullenly in the doorway . " Well , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard . " Amy hoped neither of them had heard her indrawn breath . She straightened , feeling the strain of the morning 's work in her back . Why did he need Bess in the yard ? The tall mulatto woman , seated nearby , did not look at Pettigrew , or up from her work . " You wo n't speak in front of me ? Is that it ? " " Nuffin fret you wid . " " Then it 's nothing I ca n't hear . " Amy knew the argument was futile ; he would say nothing if she forced Bess to stay with her . Anyway , he probably only wanted Bess to straighten out one of the younger girls ; Pettigrew frequently used Bess as a sort of deputy for such delicate purposes  --  thereby , of course , keeping whatever the problem was a secret from Amy . Amy often thought that it was too bad that Pettigrew and Bess had not married  --  each other , she meant . Pettigrew had a skinny caramel-colored wife who crept about the yard in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hound dog kicked once too often by an overbearing master . Amy conceded that it would not be easy to be married to Pettigrew ; and , of course , he 'd got four children from Reba already . But Bess ! Tough-minded and independent as she was , Bess could have handled even Pettigrew . But Bess had never taken a husband  --  " Ern nigguhs ai nt wuff kiIIin ! " she 'd say , when asked about it  --  andp296neither the General nor Amy had tried to push her into marriage . The General , Amy was sure ( though , of course , they never discussed such matters ) did not  --  as some plantation owners did  --  regard Africanwomen as mere brood mares . Of course , they were all immoral that way , and no doubt Bess with her statuesque body was no better with men than she should be on Saturday nights and holidays . But she could have been a perfect wife for Pettigrew , as even he tacitly recognized by so often using her to help him manage the people . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd known he could n't dominate her as he did Reba . As things were , Pettigrew was unhampered in his reign . But this time , Amy thought , his request and manner were brazen enough , even for him , to force her to protest little , and unusual enough so that she could not help wondering if maybe he had heard something of Jason . Pettigrew waited stubbornly in the doorway . Bess snip-snipped at homespun , still not looking up . Amy felt her helplessness against their stolid insistence . She leaned forward an inch or two so that the revolver suspended beneath her skirts pressed against the edge of the big table on which she was working . The touch of the metal against her leg gave her resolution . " Do n't be gone long then , Bess . You do n't want children to be cold this winter . " Bess put down her scissors and followed Pettigrew down the hall toward the rear of the house , moving almost soundlessly on the wide hardwood flooring the Judge 's father had fitted himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lingering odor of bate . No real reason , of course , to think it was about Jason . But since the sheriff 's visit , anything out of the ordinary  --  an unaccustomed noise in the house , the least hint of a knowing look on a black face , a silence longer than usual where they were working , an unexpected footfall  --  set her to thinking of Jason ; or rather to thinking of him more directly , since he was seldom out of her consciousness at all . She stayed out of the kitchen as much as possible , to avoid Easter 's red-rimmed eyes and doleful manner . If they 'd caught him , Sheriff Maxton surely would have sent word . Even more certainly , the Africans in their inexplicable way would have heard the news and given some sign , probably sooner than the sheriff . Amy was not sure whether such a sign would have been of sorrow or of satisfaction . But she was sure that Jason was still at large . And he was married to Easter , which was why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come looking for him . " Some nigguh hidin dis place I gone know fo him take twop297brefs , " Pettigrew had said . " Ai nt need no dawgs yolpin round scarin folks . " Could that be why he 'd called Bess into the yard ? When Amy sat down , the pistol dangling on its ribbon had slipped between her legs . The General had explained to her that as long as the hammer was down on an empty chamber the gun could not go off accidentally . It would have to be cocked before it could be fired . At first she had worried , anyway , at having the thing hanging under her skirts ; she feared shooting off a toe or a kneecap . But she had become used to the weight and touch of the metal on her skin , and every time she thought of Jason she was glad the pistol was there . Amy closed her thighs on it as she worked , feeling the ribbed ivory of the butt , the slight protuberance of the cylinder as comfortingreminders  --  not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braving death every day , maybe right that moment , in Virginia ; surely she could hold herself together , look after little Luke , until they caught that murderer . The General already was proud of her and the way she managed Sycamore with Pettigrew 's help . He 'd be even prouder , when he learned of it , if she kept up her nerve until they caught Jason . She worked steadily at the patterns and the homespun , every so often squeezing the warm metal , the rough ivory between her thighs . If they caught him anytime soon , she would n't even mind so much being in a condition again  --  if she really was . No nausea yesterday or today but no sign of her monthlies either . Wonderful if a false alarm . And the next time the General came home , he 'd have to control himself , after the scare she 'd had and the angry letter she 'd written . He 'd have to , if she proved to be really in a delicate condition . She squeezed the pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her thighs . Maybe separate bedrooms . Racy little Jane Moring , visiting from Raleigh , had whispered that that was the way for a woman to send her husband to the yard ; but the General would never do that and the things Jane said were a scandal anyway . Comfortingand warm to sleep next to the man you loved , of course , but it did seem to . . . inflame him . Especially mornings . In the warm room and the afternoon sunshine coming through the open window , Amy was beginning to be drowsy . She put down the scissors and leaned back in the chair , flexing her thighs rhythmicallyagainst the comforting pistol , thinking of the General , wondering where he was , why men were so insistent on that . Maybe because only women had to suffer the consequences . Maybe because men were so . . . she groped sleepily for a word to express her idea . So prominent . Being made the way they were kept that on their minds . In the warmth and the familiar sounds coming through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dog barking , the chatter of blue jays , somewhere the sound of a hammer  --  Amy was almost asleep . In another moment she drifted into a dream of the General , magnificent in dress uniform , with an enormous pistol strapped to his waist . She saw him stride high-booted through the lower hallway of Sycamore , up the stairs his grandfather had built , and into their bedroom ; she watched him enter from where she was lying in the big four-poster with its down mattress and the quilts that had been her mother 's . He strode to the bed , pulled the pistol from his belt and placed it on her legs . Except that it was not a pistol prominent on the quilt but his .. . Bess 's chair scraped on the floor and Amy awoke with a start , feeling herself flushed . She was embarrassed by her dream and the pistol clenched clammily between her perspiring legs . Bess was picking up her scissors . " Oh . . . Bess . . . I must of dozed off . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No . . . no ... " Amy sat straighter , annoyed now by the heavy gun under her skirts . She did not want that kind of dream again . " Too much to do . " Then she remembered Pettigrew . She tried to keep her voicelight and indifferent . " What secrets you'n Pettigrew keepin ? " Bess sniffed . " Em nigguh gals more'n he kin handle . " " Penny , I bet . " " Ai nt no need you frettin , Mistis . " Was there something tight , apprehensive , about Bess ? As if she might be listening for something ? She gave no outward sign ; the hand holding the scissors was steady . But Amy knew Bess well , had known her for years . She had come back with a tension in her manner , not quite visible on her face , that had not been there before Pettigrew tapped at the door . " Was it about Jason ? " " Wha-a-t ? " Bess 's feigned surprise  --  the lifted brows , the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Jason , were n't you ? " " JAY-son ! Why , Mistis , ai nt nobody studyin Jason round-yere . " That was merely evasive . " Easter 's studyin'im , all right . " " Oh , yassum , Easter ... Easter 's ' is woman . " Bess 's tone of finalitydismissed the idea that Jason 's woman could have a serious view of the matter . " Now , Bess ... I want the truth . What did Pettigrew tell you about Jason just now ? " Under the table , through her skirts , she moved the pistol to rest flatly on top of her right thigh . Bess snipped cloth . " Pe'grew ai nt seen hide ner hair-a no Jason . "  | " He did n't call you out in the yard to tell you that . " Amy was snore determined than usual to get the truth out of one of them ; this time , it mattered . " Nome . Say I got ta take a-holt at Penny . " Amy sighed , and cut homespun sleeves . Logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier , trying to give one more birth than any woman ought . And Penny with her saucy bottom was clearly on the road to perdition . But Amy was convinced there was news of Jason ; she had been so certain for so long that something had to happen that she almost willed it to have happened . Anything better than waiting . But if they would n't tell her , it could n't be good news . Maybe he 'd been in touch somehow with Easter . The Africans had their ways about things like thatMaybe they were even hiding him somewhere on the place . They all stuck together and it would be easy to do , if the dogs did n't come back . Amy was still uncomfortable about Bess sleeping in her room . Every night , now , she woke and listened for Bess 's breathing , to make sure of the slow , rhythmic exhalations of a true sleeper . She decided to keep pressing Bess  --  although she was fearful , too , of what she might learn . " Does Easter know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply , proudly . " Easter so scairt she ai nt know funt fum back . " The hint of disdain was unmistakableandthe first acknowledgment between them , subtle as it was , of the reality of Jason . The hint more than the words emboldened Amy to say what she had been thinking since the night Sheriff Maxton had ridden away with the dogs . The General would n't like it , if he ever found out . But the General was in Virginia , fighting his fight , and hers was here and now . She , not the General , had to deal with Jason . " Bess ... if Easter wants to go . . . to Jason , I mean ... The scissors in Bess 's hands stopped snipping . She looked at AInv with still , impenetrable eyes . " I would n't have to know . . . until too late to stop her . " Bess did not blink or move . Of course she knew what Amy was getting at ; they always knew . If Easter went to Jason , Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter what the Generalmight say , that seemed to Amy the surest way to protect little Luke and the Judge , not to mention herself . If Jason had no reason to cone . " Will you tell Easter that ? " " Nome . " Bess picked up a piece of ' blue-dyed homespun and started cutting.  |p300For  a moment of flashing anger Amy wanted to slap her insufferableyellow face , knock that maddening secret look out of her nigger eyes . But that moment passed , as it always did , and she took up her own scissors again . " Then I will . " They worked on in silence . Just as it began to dawn on Amy that the familiar yard sounds  --  children 's laughter , dogs snapping at each other  --  were no longer coming from the window , Bess spoke without looking up . " Pe'grew ai nt lowin none-a de Gin'al 's folks run off . " Amy had not thought of that but of course Bess was right . Pettigrewregarded himself as the General 's trustee . Pettigrew would know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speshly Easter . " While Amy was digesting that , not sure of what it meant , she was uneasily aware of the continuing silence of the yard in the middayheat . Unnatural . Her fears came rushing from deep within her , and she was reaching for the comfort of the pistol on her leg when she heard the first scream . Her hand closed tightly on the gun beneathher skirt and she stood up so quickly her chair went over backward . " Bess ! What ... " But Bess was already running to the window . Another scream . Another . Amy thought she recognized Easter 's voice . Bound to be Easter 's . Bound to be Jason . Amy stood paralyzed by the work table , the pistol in its wrapping of skirts and petticoats clutched in her hand. " 0 my Jesus , " Bess moaned at the window . " Jesus save . " But as coldly as fear had stabbed her at the first scream , Amy knew then that no one was there to save her , save Luke  --  no Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She turned from the work table and ran to the window , holding the scissors in one hand and the gun in the other so it did not slap against her legs . Rudely she pushed against Bess , so that the two of them stood pressing against each other to look into the yard . By the carriage house a group of Africans , mostly men , were huddled . Nearer , beside the kitchen connected by covered walkway to the house , Easter was down on her knees , screaming , her white apron caught up in her hands , which clutched it to her neck , giving her the appearance of a huge mushroom sprung from the grass . Above the kitchen a pall of smoke rose blackly against a sky unblemishedas a china plate . Between Easter and the huddle of Africans at the carriage house , Pettigrew crouched like a man about to dive into a pond , his arms and legs spread , his hack to Amy and Bess at thep301window . Ten feet beyond , circling catlike to Pettigrew 's left , Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sun glinted from its blade . " Pe'grew . " Bess 's murmur at Amy 's elbow was barely audible . " Jesus save my Pe'grew . " Pettigrew , Amy saw with horrifying clarity , was not yielding an inch to the threatening axe . Just then Easter quit screaming and went down with her forehead against the grass , the white apron still clutched to her neck . As if the sudden silence were a signal , Jason leaped forward , the axe swinging down in a glittering arc ; but Pettigrewleaped away to his right , unscathed , and seized in almost the same motion a stick of split pinewood from the kitchen pile . Jason recovered quickly and the two men began circling again . Jason 's shirt had been ripped half off , and the sun glistened on his deep black chest . Pettigrew was slightly built by comparison , though taller , and wirily powerful . Once Amy had seen him helping some of his men lift the trunk of a tree toppled by lightning into the truck garden , and she had marveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . But Jason was built like a bull , thick in the chest and shoulders , his head like a bludgeon on his short neck . And Jason had the axe . Amy pulled her skirts and petticoats waist high , ignoring for once Bess 's presence and her own dread of self-exposure ; but Bess never took her eyes from the yard as Amy seized the pistol 's ivory butt and quickly snipped the ribbon tied to it . Just as she dropped her skirts and covered her legs again , Jason sprang . This time he swung the axe in a wide horizontal circle . Pettigrew stepped back nimbly as the blade slashed past his stomach , missing by what Amy thought must have been no more than inches ; he swung the chunk of wood powerfully at Jason 's head . Ducking , Jason took the blow whupp ! more nearly on his arm and shoulder ; all the way to the window , Amy could hear him grunt in pain . But Jason was quick , too . He swung the axe backhanded at Pettigrew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blade struck the chunk of wood in Pettigrew 's hand and sent it sailing out of reach . With his other hand , Pettigrew caught the axe handle just below the blade . He tried for a moment to wrestle the axe from Jason 's grip but succeeded only in swinging the squat black man stumbling to his knees . Briefly they struggled in a panting tug of war , gripping the axe handle between them , Jason glaring up fiercely at Pettigrew still on his feet . Then Jason , twisting his powerful body , pulled Pettigrewto the turf and the two men rolled over , still grappling for the axe . Amy kit nauseated  --  not so much from fear as from the rawp302violence of the two creatures on the ground , savagely beating each other , their grunts and exclamations and panting breaths coming up clearly to the window . Like animals . Amy realized she had never witnessed violence before . She thought she had never seen anything so ugly , so nauseating . Just then , Pettigrew let go of the axe and sprang away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alert as a hunting dog , his face contorted , his head weaving from side to side . Six feet away , Jason 's powerful body rose to its knees , still holding the axe . Amy could not see his face but his broad shining back  --  his shirt was by then completely ripped away  --  loomed up hugely , as if just outside the window , as if she could put the muzzle of the pistol against it . She raised her arm and saw the weapon shaking in her nervous hand . She tried to point it between Jason 's massive shoulders , but she could not bring it to bear . She dropped the scissors from her left hand and with it seized her right wrist , steadying the pistol . She tried to pull back the hammer with her right thumb , as the General had taught her , but it was stiffer than she remembered from his drill ; and just as the hammer reached full cock , it slipped from her thumb , slammed down , and the pistol went off , bucking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's axe . She staggered a step backward in the deafening roar that filled the workroom . The scream this time came from Bess , piercing , echoing with the gunshot . By the carriage house , the watching Africans scattered like ground squirrels . Jason whirled about on catlike feet , and his black sweating face glared up at her , his lips pulled back and his eyes wide , hot , mad , the axe still gripped in one hand . Behind him , Pettigrew came up on his toes , his body coiling at the opportunity to spring on Jason from behind . Amy saw his head lash forward as he leaped . But he did not crash into Jason 's stumplike body as she expected ; instead , he sprawled flat on the trampled grass , at Jason 's feet . Jason whirled again ; swinging the axe with one arm , he crunched the blade down on Pettigrew 's back . At the sound  --  like that of a ripe watermelon dropped and split  --  more than at the sight  --  obscured by Jason 's broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . Bess did not scream again ; she moaned , a long , shuddering sound that seemed torn from her . And from the yard Amy could plainly hear Jason 's great panting exhausted breath . She still was more nauseated by the violence than afraid of Jason . His real presence had in some brute way dispelled her dark , ineffable fear of his coming and replaced it with the simple need to act . The pistol was still in her hand , still loaded . The act of firing , badly as she 'd botched it , seemed to her dissociated from thep303animal-like struggle in the yard . The pistol was a mere instrument , impersonal , mechanical , even in its way scientific . Nothing to do with brute strength , the savagery of bodily clash . Bess wailed as if in agony and Amy uncovered her eyes , lifting the pistol . Jason was bending over Pettigrew , his back an easy target again . Then Amy saw Easter lying on the grass beyond him , clutchingPettigrew 's ankles , as she must have done at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jason 's woman . Amy 's hand was still shaking . Before she could steady it and cock back the hammer again , Jason sprang across Pettigrew , seized Easter by the arm and ran toward the carriage house , half dragging Easter along . The few Africans who had drifted back following Amy 's shot scattered again . A good marksman might still have picked Jason off before he disappeared beyond the carriage house , but Amy did not even try . She stood transfixed at the window , dumb , holding barely to her consciousness , staring at Pettigrew 's sprawled , still body with the axe blade buried between its shoulders . The handle pointed steadily up at the window , at Amy ; and from the floor , at her feet , Bess 's wails rose sorrowful as the kitchen smoke against the impervious sky . Longstreet was not the only new arrival on the plains of Manassas that morning . Well before noon , both Kearny 's and Hooker 's Federal divisions  --  more than 10,000 Peninsula veterans Pope had ordered to Centreville the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Stone Bridge toward Groveton . Phil Kearny , one-armed , short , and belligerent , arrived first and conferred immediately with Sigel , whose Germans  --  mostly of Schurz 's Division  --  had borne the brunt of the morning 's battle . Sigel advised Kearny to take his troops north toward Sudley Church , moving for concealment on the east side of the Sudley Springs Road . At some point in that direction , he could come in on the Rebs ' left flank . Scouts reported the brigades on Jackson 's left strongly posted to defend in front  --  as Schurz could attest  --  but perhaps vulnerableon the flank . Kearny saw the usefulness of extending the Federal line to the right as suggested , and soon had his troops moving north between the road and Bull Run . Sigel held Hooker for the moment in reserve . In the midday heat , the sun relentless in a porcelain sky , silence fell briefly over the fields and woods where the two armies crouched , curing one another.  |p304Hoke  Arnall 's men , coming sullenly back through the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strip usable ammunitionfrom the dead and wounded over which they passed . Lige Flournoy and Josh did not content themselves with cartridges but rifled pockets and knapsacks , too . Few of the dead Yanks had carried anything valuable into the attack ; but Lige struck it lucky . From one knapsack he pulled a shirt with cuffs and collar , a pair of opera glasses , a small sack of coffee , and some dried apple slices hung on a string and tied in a circle . Lige stuck the coffee in his pocket , hung the apples around his neck , and threw the shirt to Josh . " Bet you ai nt ever wore a boil shirt , Meat . " While Lige peered through the opera glasses at the woods , still thick with battle smoke , through which they 'd fought , Josh unfolded the shirt , stared at it , and dropped it on the dead Yank 's chest . " Wear that , I got ta git some lace on my draws . " South of the pike , Major Jesse Thomas was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpendicular to the road . God help the Yanks that charge this line , he thought . When completed , the front would run along a high ridge that dominated the rolling Manassas plain before it ; the approach to the ridge was wooded and Longstreet 's orders were to site the brigades on the reverse slope , just below the crest and screened by it and the woods from Federal eyes . 01 Pete knew ground like nobody else . Miss Letty 's handkerchief was carefully tucked inside his jacket . It probably meant nothing , of course . But funny how wanting something to be so sometimes could make it be . For instance , the way he 'd wanted some kind of exchange with Miss Letty , if no more than a word . And then the old monkey bringing the handkerchief into camp that night . Lawrence , the mother called'im . She would be trouble , the mother . A real Virginia snob . If , of course , he ever got back to the Williams house , or survived the war . And if only he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Miss Letty ! One of his uniform buttons had had to do . But the morning 's crowded tasks left Major Thomas little time for thinking of Miss Letty , whose snow-white bust he 'd dreamed of repeatedly in the two nights following the dinner at her house . He ranged up and down the line , making sure Longstreet 's orders were being carried out . Hood 's Texans , first to arrive , took position from just south of the pike and across it , facing east toward Groveton . D. R. Jones 's Divison turned south behind Hood and marched alongp305a country lane until the troops crossed the Manassas Gap Railroad ; then Jones dug in near Dawkins Branch , on what would be the extremeright of the developing Confederate line . James Kemper 's Divisionmoved in between Hood and Jones , and Wilcox 's Division was held in reserve near Gainesville . Longstreet 's fifth division , under Dick Anderson , was coming on behind , having acted as rear guard during the march through the Gap . The line Longstreet thus drew south of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a wide angle . About 150 degrees , Thomas estimated  --  like the extended jaws of a hungry animal . The two jaws of the army , from Hill 's Division on the left to Jones 's on the right , stretched for nearly five miles through the woods and fields on either side of the pike . As Longstreet 's men began taking position , Jackson had pulled out the two brigades , Early 's and Forno 's , that had formed an earlymorningblocking force across the pike . These troops moving off to rejoin Jackson 's main line momentarily worried Thomas ; they left a gap of a quarter mile or so north of the pike , between Jackson 's right and Longstreet 's left . Cantering into that gap , however , Thomas saw that the two gapingjaws were hinged by a strong artillery force sited on a ridge between them  --  eighteen of Jackson 's guns lined up almost wheel to wheel . Thomas rode along the line and pulled up in front of a battery of six-pounders . The gunners eyed him with curiosity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Longstreet 's wing of the army . " Whose battery is this ? " " Cap'n Overholt 's , sir . Jackson 's old division . " " Had a hard time of it ? " " Give as good 's we got . " Alf Gurganous had to admit he was glad to see Longstreet 's men arrive . On the other hand , it was high time . Alf was heart and soul a part of what he still thought of as the Valley Army  --  one of 01 Jack 's boys . " Seem like we-uns alluz doin the heft-a the fightin , " he had often said to Jeff Jernigan . But that morning , Alf was in a generous mood . He was reveling in a new pair of Yank underbritches he had finally foraged at Manassas . Not a grayback in'em . Yit . " Pope showin some fight ? " Jesse Thomas saw things the other way around . It seemed to him that 01 Pete was pulling Jackson 's chestnuts out of the fire again , as on the Peninsula . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his new black hat  --  the only decent headgear Thomas could see in the whole battery  --  had come up beside Private Gurganous.  |p306All  of Lee 's army , after more than a year and a half of war , was ragged and lean and a lot of it barefoot ; but it seemed to Thomas that the men of Overholt 's Battery were little more than scarecrows  --  gaunt-cheekedand hollow-eyed , their shirts hanging in tatters , hats shapeless , trousers out at the knees . Unkempt beards and hair made Jackson 's men look more like pirates than soldiers . But Overholt 's pieces gleamed with loving care . He 'd give'em that . " Gunners over ther we-uns could use rightchere , " Alf said , thinking of the twelve-pound Napoleons that had given them fits the evening before . He was giving them the highest compliment he knew how to pay . Thomas turned his horse 's head toward the pike . " Reck'n fore long we 'll get a look at'em ourselves . " He waved a casual salute to Overholt 's boys and trotted off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . But 01 Pete had brought in the real army in time to save the day . In the drastically thinned ranks of the Stonewall Brigade , a few hundred yards from Overholt 's Battery , Privates Sowell and Stone lay at ease just behind the railroad cut . They had brought in Lott McGrath 's piece for old times ' sake , and stacked it with the rest of the company 's arms . Like the troops around them , they were ready to rush into the cut at the first sign of Yank movement . " But they ai nt comin . " Gilly had hacked open a tin of potted ham , a prize from Manassas , and was smearing the meat with his pocket knife on a piece of Yank hardtack remarkably free of weevils . " Em sons got a bellyful yistiddy . " Sowell was not so sure . " This the twenny-ninth , ai nt it ? Day Lott seen the sign of . " " He could of read it wrong . Maybe yistiddy wa'nt the wrong day atall . " Sowell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run out , then , he read the sign wrong ? Ask me , we gone ketch it today , sure'n shit . " Gilly ate potted ham and generously offered some to Sowell , who declined . Sowell liked to say he would be beholden to no man ; besides , he had filched his own potted ham . " Right down queer , " Gilly said . " Him not bein ther . " " Whole durn war 's queer . Like last winter I-uz goin down to sign up with Stonewall ? Well , I come on down-a road to Sinjun 's Run , nearby Hampshire Crossin . Up in the Valley ther ? " Stone was a Valley man , too , and nodded recognition . " So durn cold a man 's piss 'd freeze fore it hit the ground . So I seen this bunch on guardp307ther at the Run . Some sittin'n some lyin'n some standin . Give'em a holler'n not a man of ' em move ner sid a word . " " 01 Jack knew , he 'd of had ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I come on crosst the Run . It-uz froze solid .

Still standin guard in heaven , I reck'n , lessen th'other place melt ' em down . " " Wha 'd you do ? " Gilly licked his knife blade . " Do ? Hightail outten ther fore I froze , too . " Gilly pondered Sowell 's story at some length . " But that-uz natchral . Freezin , I mean . Git cold enuf , man gone freeze . Ai n't natchral Lott not lyin ther wher I seen ' im hit . My own eyes . " Applejack , the company booze-maker , was just then walking past , scratching the redbugs that had infested his belly when he had slept face down the night before , too tired to spread his blankets . " Lookin fer Lott McGrath ? " Gilly owed Applejack four bits for a half canteen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Applejack might be working , and spoke in churchly tones : " Kilt yistiddy , Jack . " " Kilt , my ass . I seen'im ten minutes ago . " Sowell sat up . " You seen Lott ? " " Big 's life'n twicet as dirty . Goin toward-a woods . " Applejack swept his arm in a vague circle to the north . Sowell looked at Gilly . " Shore it uz him ? " " Bastard owe me fo bits . " Applejack looked narrowly at Gilly . " Too . Ai nt likely I 'd mistake'im . " Sowell got to his feet . " Say he 's goin at way ? " " Lookin like he do n't know me . But I knowed him . " Applejack moved on with dignity befitting a man of business , a creditor at that . " Le 's go , Gilly . Lott 's in ' em woods someres . " " Mebbe so . " Gilly folded his knife and carefully folded the halfemptytin into his blanket roll . " Mebbe not . But iffen he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was impatient . " Must be wounded . Wandrin round needinhelp . " " Not with the hole I seen in ' is skull . " " Well , I aim to find ' im . " Sowell hitched up the trousers bagging down from his skinny hips and started toward the rear . " Hey , Sowbelly ! " Gilly was on his feet , too . " Sposen he 's dead ? " " But Applejack jus seen ' im . " Gilly was profoundly conscious of the importance of what he said next , again in his best church voice :  | " I mean sposen he 's dead anyhow ? " Sowell stared at him open-mouthed . " War ai nt that queer . " He made for the rear again . Gilly hesitated , then hurried after his friend . They were almost out of the lines when Buzzard Billings , the sergeant commanding the company that morning for lack of officers , shouted : " Wher'n hell you webfoots think you goin ? " " See the chaplain . " Sowell walked on . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bein at hole'n Lott 's head nearbout big enough to stick a Bible in . The sergeant shouted at them again but was too shorthanded to do anything ; and he knew them well enough to think they would be back when needed . As the brief noonday lull ended and the sounds of battle began to reverberate again on Hill 's front , Sowell and Gilly disappeared into the forests of Sudley Mountain . Carl Schurz was a proud man , politically important , who frequently wrote to President Lincoln to advise him on the conduct of the war . When Sigel notified him that Kearny was bypassing him on the right in an effort to turn Jackson 's left , the offended Schurz promptly reformed his tired brigades and sent Schimmelfennig and Krzyzanowskiback through the woods where the morning 's bloody tides had surged . But this time Schimmelfennig 's Ohio , Pennsylvania , and West Virginia boys cannily held their fire until they neared the Reb lines . Word of Longstreet 's opportune arrival had not made its way , officially or by grapevine , that far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranks depleted by the forenoon carnage , had picketed his front rather sparsely and not too far into the woods ahead . He believed the Yanks had had enough of his fiercely defended front and next would try Jackson somewhere else , if at all . His regiments , too , were worn out from the woods fighting and from five consecutive days of hard marching and sleeping on their arms . Though supposedly on the alert , most of the troops were sprawled and taking what rest they could when at about 12:30 p.m. the Yanks came bursting from the woods , firing as they came . Foxy Bradshaw had been explaining to Lige , as they lay side by side in the cut : " Damdest thing y'ever seen . Comin back thew em woods withbluebellies runnin up our tails . So I far 'd at one'n slip behind a tree'nreload . Still got my rod inna barl , this big Yank come jumpin roundmy tree'n pins me up agin it with'is piece . Stuck it right'n my chest . " ' Reb ! ' he yells . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Christ , I thought I uz a deader . But when he drawed trigger , y'know what ? " " Misfar 'd , I reck'n . " Foxy 's tales no longer interested Lige . " Naw . " Foxy 's voice was triumphant . " He uz the deader . Goin over backards soons he got the words outten'is mouth . Somebody 's bullet'n'is head . At-er piece a-hissen goes up'n fars right'n my face but the goddam ball , it goes whooshin up pass my nose so close I kin feel the breeze . " Lige eyed Foxy skeptically . " Thought yuh said y'uz wounded . " " Hurt , I said . That muzzle blast right'n my face , I jerk my head backards , it bang agin-a tree trunk so hard I fell out colder'n a stone . " " Whut happen to the tree ? " Foxy did not choose to answer , or perhaps to hear , and anyway , at that moment , the Yanks ripped out of the woods and poured in their first volley . Lige grabbed his piece and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and threw his arms over his head . This time the weight of shock was with Schimmelfennig . Before Dixon 's Rifles , manning the front line in the railroad cut , could get off more than a ragged return fire , the blueclads swarmed into the cut and over it , surging through Dixon , through McCrary 's second line and up the knoll that anchored Jackson 's flank . Teddy Redmund , still observing from the ridge above , immediately turned his glasses away from the brutish hand-to-hand fighting that resulted to peer at Jackson 's threatened left . On that part of the chessboard in his mind , Kearny 's approaching blues were screened by woods ; but Redmund had been aware for some time of dust rising in that direction , along Bull Run . Bound to be blues , feeling for Jackson 's farthest flank . And soon enough the butternut batteries had shifted their attention to the left . The moment the blues carried Brigadier Arnold 's knoll , Redmundrealized that if a simultaneous attack came over the open field on Arnold 's left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . But as Schimmelfennig 's new attack broke over the railroad cut , the Reb batteries opened thunderous fire over the open field across which the flank attack would have to come , and on the woods beyond it , where the blues would have to form for such a charge . Redmund had no sooner swung his glasses to the left than he concluded that no such attack was coming . Blues over there , no doubt of that , but there 'd be no attack for the bloody good reasonthat amateur troops like these would never charge through the artillery fire that Hill 's gunners could lay on the field and the woods.  |p310Sam  Stowe had been incensed that Hill had called back Arnall 's second counterattack just when his and Thomas 's fresh regiments could have chased the Yanks into Bull Run . His fighting instincts , once aroused , still churned in him . Peering over the rail fence at the iron wall of shot and shell Hill 's guns were erecting across the field in front of him , Stowe realized as quickly as Redmund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without waiting for orders from Arnall , he about-faced his regiment and charged his South Caroliniansinto the melee that had erupted behind Arnall 's front line . When the attack hit , Larkin Folsom had been boiling a pot of coffee for the General , although his mind actually had been upon the sonnet he had started composing the day before on the road from Centreville . Corporal Gilmore had seemed to like what he 'd heard of it , and that gave Folsom confidence , pride in his work . The orderly had settled upon a rhyme scheme  --  aba , aba  --  and finished off the first six lines in his head . Now he was trying out an opening for another six lines of aba , aba : If , too , thy smile were but a candle 's raywhich maybe seemed a little obvious but fit the rhyme scheme nicely and also the larger idea : that flickers golden till the night is done and dies when dawn refuses to delay .. . The shattering Yank volley jerked Folsom out of this pleasant preoccupation . Nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yanks pouring over the knoll . The orderly stared at this blue apparition for no more than a second ; then a Minie went past his ear wheat ! and another dashed the coffeepot off the fire and sent it rolling down the slope , spewing its hot liquid in all directions . Folsom ran then . He was fast on his feet as a colt , and fright almost literally gave him wings . He was not afraid of the Yanks , but he did n't want them to grab the General 's horse . Gin'al have my hide for sure , that happen . Folsom sprinted for the little gully in which he 'd tethered Rambler , slid into it feet first , grabbed the musket he 'd left there , and rolled over in the dirt . He lay prone with the rifle poised , ready to defend his charge , although he had never fired the musket in anger . Corporal Gilmore had cleaned it for him just that morning . By then , on the reverse slope of the knoll , Sparks 's Tar Heels andp311Stowe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schimmelfennig 's Yanks . Some of Arnall 's front- and second-line troops also had drifted back into the fight . Blue and butternut alike had lost rank and order ; the men of both armies mingled and surged like a racetrack crowd in panic , many of them falling to be trampled in the dust and broomsedge . Bayonets flashed in the sun ; the highpitchedyelping of the butternuts , the hoarser shouts of the Yanks , the screams of the wounded , blended into a hellish chorus . The crack and clatter of small arms rang above the artillery thundering from the ridge , although Folsom wondered how anyone could tell who to shoot at . Peering over the rim of the gully , the orderly saw Corporal Gilmoreswinging his musket by the barrel like a baseball bat , clearing a circle around himself . When a Yank came charging at him from behind , Gilmore twisted about just in time , sidestepped and speared the Yank in the belly with a hand-held bayonet ; the Yank stumbled on toward Folsom , a look of incredulity on his face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself carefully to the ground on his side and drew himself into a fetus-like ball . Gilmore was trying to get through the mob to General Arnall . When the Yanks had come pounding and shooting across the knoll , Arnall had been behind the lines with Sparks 's Tar Heels , checking the regiment 's casualties and ammunition . Gilmore had been sprawled under a tree where he could watch Folsom 's lithe young body moving around and the way the boy 's pants stretched over his butt when he bent to the General 's coffeepot . As soon as the first bluecoat topped the knoll , the corporal sprang to his feet and seized his musket . He ran for Arnall 's side but before he could get there Yanks were all around , thicker'n flies in a barnyard . The last he had seen of the General , Arnall had had a saber in one hand and his pistol in the other , the latter aimed squarely in the face of a big Yank . Hoke Arnall had never been in hand-to-hand combat , not even with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been his most immediate personal contribution to the war . But as Gilmore fought to reach him , the General felt himself suddenly and strangely free , bursting with energy , as if the pistol shot had set off an electric charge in his veins  --  as if the violence exploding around him , in him , had blown away the life he had led and all it had seemed to have made of him . Suddenly , he forgot his arrest , forgot Amy , forgot his ambitions , angers , frustrations , and all the entanglementsof duty and morality and religion . His body responded to the instinct of survival as if it had merely been waiting for brute strength to assume its rightful primacy . In ap312convulsion of self-preservation  --  the only realities his saber slashing flesh and bone , the power of the pistol kicking and blasting in his other hand , the sense of invincibility they sent flashing like blood to his brain  --  he did not think at all . The sound of his grunting breath as he maimed and killed echoed an animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response was joyful as salvation . Then the moment passed , as joy does . A big and powerful man unrestrained , Arnall cut his way like a scythe through the encircling Yanks . In a few bloody moments he was out of the mob and had to take command again  --  of himself first . Organize . . . Jackson 's flank . . . clear these people out .. . He looked around for some sign of military order  --  a regiment , a company . Any rock to build upon . But nothing . Chaos . Arnall had the vague impression that somewhere in the struggling mass he had seen a planter 's hat trampled in the broomsedge . He ran for the knoll . Ca n't have chaos . Maybe an organized line still in the cut . Rally'em . Clear these people out . But before he could do anything , a long and menacing line of butternut troops came rolling over a rise of ground to the rear of his position . Arnall felt a surge of immense relief . Hill . Reinforcements . The butternut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brigade . Identification turned relief to irritation , doubt . Branch 's Brigade saving Hoke Arnall 's bacon . Hill had had to send Branch . On top of the arrest . But Arnall was a professional . The sight of the oncoming line was the rock he needed . He lifted his saber high and waved on Branch 's men . " This way , boys ! " His battle voice , he knew , would somehow reach them . " Drive ' em , boys ! Give it to'em ! " Even as he yelled , the first bluecoats broke before the new onslaughtand began to run back over the knoll . A Yank rifleman , his hat gone , his weapon lost somewhere in the struggle , his mouth hanging open and his eyes rolling in the idiocy of fear , trotted over the knoll toward the cut and the safety of the woods . Arnall shot him in the face with the last charge in the pistol . It occurred to the General then that there had been no need to call upon God for deliverance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid unasked . Captain Micah G. Duryea was torn between apprehension and disgustas he rode along the flanks of Fitz-John Porter 's divisions , marching in brilliant midday sun on the road from Manassas Junc/tion to Gainesville . Duryea was by then certain that General Pope either had lost his grip on the situation or was laboring under a stubborn delusion . If that was the choice , disaster was bound to lie ahead . Colonel Russell , at least , had appeared impressed with Duryea 's appraisal that Jackson was not retreating . But Pope obviously had not been , despite the plain evidence of battle noise and smoke . Then , when Russell called Duryea aside for further orders , even the colonel had disputed the meaning of the dust cloud above the road from Thoroughfare Gap . " Buford 's cavalry 's out that way , Duryea . General Pope says that smoke 's bound to be him pitching into Stuart . " Duryea had tried to point out that the low gray cloud over the Thoroughfare road was red-tinted dust , not battle smoke . Trained eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could drive home the argument , Russell had rather impatiently silenced him and sent him off with a letter for Porter and McDowell . The latter general , Russell told him , was reported to be with Porter , although in the confusion of the field no one could be sure . Duryea was to look for him with Porter 's headquarters group . That was typical of this whole mismanaged collision of the armies , Duryea thought . Pope could not even be sure where to find his second-ranking officer , the commander of his largest corps ! But even that , in Duryea 's view , was understandable by comparison to the commanding general 's inexplicable conviction that Jackson was trying to get away to rejoin the main southern army beyond the mountains . Hardheaded analysis of the situation suggested , instead , that the rest of Lee 's army was coming over the mountains to join Jackson . But orders were orders and Duryea had had no choice but to ride to Porter with Pope 's letter . He found Porter 's column , with King 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strung out for miles on the narrow road from Manassas to Gainesville . He guessed the trailing regiments probably had not left Manassas by the time he caught up to Porter riding at its head . That would have taken longer had the column not been halted for the last few minutes of Duryea 's ride . When he did reach Porter , the general was quietly watching skirmishers being deployed across Dawkins Branch ahead of him . Duryea had never seen Fitz-John Porter before , although he knew his fighting reputation from the Peninsula . Porter had a high forehead , a fine strong nose , and a neatly trimmed beard ; he was a man of erect and soldierly appearance , quite in contrast to portly Irvin McDowell , who was indeed riding beside him . Duryea handed Pope 's letter to McDowell , the senior of the two generals . Watching Porter as McDowell read , Duryea 's appraising eye no/ticed an air of indifference , almost listlessness , about the newcomer from McClellan 's army , as if nothing could concern him less than what his new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down as the sort of air some men assume in times of danger and decision , as they try to convey to others how cool and collected they are . " Strange . " McDowell handed the letter to Porter . " Pope seems to think Longstreet ca n't get here at least until tomorrow night or next day . " Across the branch , dust was visible beyond a ridge rising less than a mile farther ahead . Open fields lay between branch and ridge . Blueclad skirmishers were zigging and zagging across the fields , low to the ground ; an occasional crack of a musket from the woods that covered the ridge slowed and scattered them . Porter quickly read Pope 's letter , frowned , and shook his head . " I ca n't make out what he wants , General . First he says go on to Gainesville and get in communication with his left wing . But not a word about whether to attack or not . And what 's this mean ? " He handed the letter back to McDowell , pointing to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emphatic voice : " ' If any considerable advantages are to be gained by departing from this order , it will not be strictly obeyed . ' I guess that 's to give us some discretion . " Duryea , listening more to the hoarse roar of the battle to the northeast , decided from its rising volume that Pope must have thrown in more troops in support of Sigel . " I hope that 's what it means anyway , " McDowell went on in more normal tones . " Because if we go on to Gainesville the way he wants , it looks to me like we might run right up on Longstreet 's corps . If Buford 's information is correct . " The reference to " Buford 's information " caught Duryea 's attention . He had considerable respect for Pope 's cavalry commander . Maybe Pope would listen to John Buford if he said Longstreet was about to join Jackson and reunite the Rebel army . " Then how do we get in communication with Pope 's left ? " Porterasked . McDowell shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that direction . " I can tell you that 's rough country in there ... " He pointed . " To march troops through . Thick woods , underbrush , a lot of little creeks . Could n't keep a brigade together , much less this corps . " He sighed and spoke matter-of-factly . " Ought to know . I was lost in there all last night . " Duryea barely contained an exclamation thoroughly unsuitable to his sense of the fitness of things . The fate of the army , maybe evenp315the nation , at stake , and Pope 's senior corps commander , a former commanding general of the whole army , could n't find his way out of the woods on a dark night ! No wonder , Duryea thought , the damned slavers were winning the war , overrunning the country with their bullwhips and black concubines and dog killers . With such generals as these , God help the poor old Union ! " ... too far out to fight a battle here , Porter . " Duryea listened in sullen anger as the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow Pope 's apparently puzzling order . He could not fully understand their concern , because he did not know that the note from John Buford , casually mentioned by General McDowell , had reported what Duryea would have realized was the most important information of the campaign  --  that at 8:45 a.m . Buford had counted seventeen butternut regiments , one battery , and 500 cavalry moving from Thoroughfare Gap through Gainesville . Longstreet was already on the field . Micah G. Duryea believed in lines of responsibility , orderly procedure , rational decision . In his scheme of things , such information would have been passed along immediately to the commanding general , particularly by such a meticulous officer as Irvin McDowell ; and Pope would have been persuaded immediately of the true situationby Buford 's observation . Less rigidly disciplined men  --  Colonel Russell , say , or Colonel Channing  --  were more used than Duryea to human fallibility , and all too well aware that war was the least certain of human undertakings . They had seen the most careful plans break down , the tightest organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they knew , the most elementary necessities could be overlooked even by experiencedcommanders  --  just as , that hot day on the road from Manassasto Gainesville , General McDowell had inexplicably failed to pass on Buford 's note to John Pope . The dust Duryea had seen rising beyond Dawkins Branch was not being raised , however , by Longstreet 's oncoming divisions . A single company of Jeb Stuart 's cavalry , under the temporary supervision of a staff officer , Captain Fargo Hart , was indulging Stuart 's talent for ingenuity and theatrics . After his conference with General Lee near Hay Market , Stuart and his escort had galloped south of the pike , where one of Stuart 's brigadiers , Beverley Robertson , already was taking position to guard the approaching Longstreet 's right flank . Stuart had ordered his headquarters set up on a hill that corn/manded a view over the Manassas plain all the way east to Centreville . From its peak , the smoke of battle near Bull Run was plainly visible , as were the Yanks still creeping in masses westward along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slower'n corn growin , " Colonel Snowden remarked . But before Longstreet 's line was completely in place or its right flank anchored , the approach of a different force of blue troops , this one along the road from Manassas , had been reported . Another generalmight have hastened off word to Longstreet either to pull back or to push more quickly into position . Either course might have put Longstreet at a disadvantage against a force of unknown size and mission ; either would have been a tacit shifting of responsibility to Longstreet himself . Stuart , more ebullient than ever now that the dangerous division of Lee 's forces was near an end , never considered such a message . " Here 's what I aim to do . . . " Cackling with laughter and slappinghis thigh , Stuart confided his plan for holding off the unidentifiedbody of Yanks marching up the road from Manassas . The general sat his horse as easily , Fargo Hart thought , as if he were on a country picnic ; and he discussed his plans with Snowden and other staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs or carriage horses . Hart had often heard Stuart elaborate at the mess table and around the camp fire on the virtues of speed , surprise , audacity ; no wonder he had donned his cavalry command like a comfortable suit of clothes , or that Jackson valued him so highly . The two generals believed in action above all . " But these Yankees take care , " Hart had heard Stuart say . " Not a surprise'n McClellan 's whole army that I ever saw on the Peninsula . I reck'n Pope 's crowd 'll be about the same . " Now , having outlined his plan , Stuart winked ostentatiously at Hart . " Think you can handle it , Cap'n ? Ai nt it a good un ? " " Sure is , sir . " Stuart was not a man of small appetite , for praise or anything else . " Stop'em in their tracks . " Stuart cackled again . " Wait'n see if it do n't . " Hart quickly trotted off to find a proper locale . A country lane leading east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields grown up in underbrush proved suitable . Feeling rather like Joshua marching around Jericho , Hart put the troopers to cutting pine boughs . Then they tied them to their halter straps and dragged them back and forth along the lane , much amused at the wafts of dust thus sent into the air in fine imitation of that raised by marching troops . " Reck'n this 'll really fool'em ? " Lieutenant Calloway , in corn/mand of the company , peered anxiously toward the rival dust cloud , which they knew to be caused by the real thing , over the Manassas Road . " Wo n't have to for long . " The question had aroused Hart from a reverie in which he had been wondering if he could get free to spirit Missy away from Brace 's ramshackle house . Longstreet 's front was going to be too close to it for safety . Summoned by the lieutenant back to the business at hand , Hart was irritated with himself . What foolishness , that a skinny child could so easily have taken his mind off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day ! And , of course , it was old Brace 's duty , not Hart 's , to see to his family 's safety . Durward P. Brace was at that moment not far away , lying flat in underbrush near the top of the wooded ridge toward which Duryea had seen the blue skirmishers advancing north of Dawkins Branch . Henry lay at Brace 's side , and one of General Robertson 's officers  --  an engineer captain that Brace had muttered to Henry " would n't go knee-high on a piss-ant "  --  lay just beyond Henry . The piss-ant captain turned a pair of high-powered glasses on the Yanks beyond the branch and studied them for a long time ; then he rolled on his side and put the glasses into their case with conclusivemovements , as if weighty matters had been settled . " Whole corps over ther . Prob'ly Porter . Damn near mint us at Gaines 's Mill . " Brace did not know how big a corps was , nor who Porter might be , and he had never heard of any miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he watched the Yank skirmishers crossing the field , some of them getting close to the woods , exactly what he was going to do . If the piss-ant captain gave him room enough . " He start crost the crick with that whole corps , he 'll run right up Longstreet 's shirtfront . Got to git some guns on this ridge . " The captain spoke as confidently as Brace supposed General Lee might have . Then he said exactly what Brace wanted to hear : " You'n your darky stay here . " Naturally , he spoke directly to the white man , as if Henry were no more than the barebacked mule he had tethered back over the top of the ridge . " They start to put any force at all over the crick , I mean like a coupla hunnert men or more , or any big guns at all , leave the darky to watch'n hightail it back up the road to warn Gin'al Robertson . " " How bout em boys downer ? " Brace pointed at the blue skirmisherstrotting low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kecp'em busy . " The piss-ant captainp318began crawling back through the underbrush . " Look sharp now ! " Brace felt no fear of the distant Yanks . They scarcely seemed real , that far off , and it had not occurred to him , anyway , that somebodymight shoot at him . He did not feel that he was a real part of the army , so why would anybody shoot at him ? Besides , his thoughts had been preoccupied with Henry and what he was going to do once Henry was out of the way . At one point , lying there in the sun , he had raised himself a hard-on , remembering Sajie baretitted . The way'er ass felt upside of a hard dick . Abruptly , Brace crawled after the piss-ant captain getting back over the ridge just as the captain was hoisting himself aboard a horse three times too big for him . " Wait up there ! " The captain gazed at him severely as Brace rose to his feet and stumbled through the underbrush . " I uz thinkin . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe we oughtta have us a far-arm ? " " Sure God oughtta . Too bad you ai nt . " " You got two ther . " The captain had a captured Yank carbine in a saddle holster and wore a pistol strapped to his belt . " Keepin'em both , too . Git on back-er like I told you'n keep'n eye out . " Brace watched him ride off . He had not really expected the pissantto part with one of the weapons ; and anyway , Brace did n't want to shoot Henry . He was no murderer . He slipped down in the underbrush again and crawled snakelike back over the ridge to Henry 's side . The African , lying there solid as a tree trunk , dwarfed him ; but Brace suddenly felt himself more powerful , commanding , than just being white had ever meant to him . " New orders . " He did not look at Henry as he whispered . " Cap'n sez he wants you down ther't edge-a the woods . " Henry did not seem to move but Brace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead . Some of the Yanks had reached the woods and the cracking of musketry was increasing . All to the good . " How come he say ? " " Sojers do n't ask no questions . Git on down at hill . " Henry did n't move . Brace knew , of course , that in the end he would go . Nigguhs did what white men told'em . That was the law of life . Henry only needed a little pushing . " Wants a closer look at'em Yanks comin crost there'n sez safer to send you cause Yanks ai nt gone shoot nobody cullud . They 's ab'lishionist. "  |p319Still  Henry did not move and Brace became impatient . Prob'ly not much time fore the piss-ant come back or sent for'em . " But em Virginia boys shore-God will . Nigguh do n't do what they say do . " Brace gave that a few seconds to sink in . When it did , Henry said nothing still but began to crawl away through the underbrush . Brace thought with satisfaction that he had never seen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alla way down ! " Brace 's loud whisper was just to make sure . " Edge-at field ! " Henry crawled on , not so quietly or with as little disturbance of the underbrush as Brace with his thin body would have managed . Henry was a big'un ; Brace could follow his progress right down the hill by the rippling motion in the weeds and scrub  --  like a groundhogtunneling , Brace thought . He did not take his eyes off the telltalepassage . Henry 's progress was slow but steady . Brace was satisfied that it also was noisy and visible enough that someone besides himself was bound to spot it  --  whether one of the Virginia boys concealed in the woods or one of the Yanks in the field or now edging into the woods , he did not care . Brace knew little of war but he had the sure instinct that boys shooting at each other would be nervous . Either side would be likely to shoot anything moving ; see what it was later . Time passed . Nothing happened . Henry crawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fools blind or deef , ca n't see'n elephant pass . The sun beat down from the glassy sky . Still nothing happened . But Brace knew it would . He felt his senses rising to an irresistible rush . The moving underbrush that marked Henry 's passage had reached to within a rod , by Brace 's estimate , of the indistinct line where woods gave way to field . Suddenly , a Yank skirmisher  --  looking not unlike a jack-in-the-box Brace once had seen a drummer demonstratein the store at Gainesville  --  straightened from his crouch , leaped in a half-turn to his right , brought his musket to his shoulder , and aimed at the trail of movement in the underbrush . Brace felt the immense surge of satisfaction that had been gathering in him . I knowed it knowed it 'd work . He saw the white spurt of smoke from the musket , and did not realize that in his excitement he was clutching his hard penis in his right hand , through his thin trousers . Just as the flat , amazingly distant smack of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry 's creeping passage erupted , as if thrown back by sweeping arms and Henry rose into view  --  at first majestically , a huge imposing figure like a bear leapingp320from hiding toward its prey ; then , in midair , collapsing as if punctured , so that air and substance and life rushed out as one , and Henry 's body , limp and grotesque as the hide of a skinned grizzly , disappeared back into the underbrush . Brace had to squeeze down hard to keep from coming . But his ecstasy was charged with pride . Not since the old skinflint left Kate the farm and the Africans , after all those years of treating Brace like a hired hand , had he felt so much in charge of himself , so in control of his destiny , so sure of his ability to manage . Brace felt like a man , lying there in the brush and the heat and the echoes of musketry , holding himself , knowing he 'd done what he 'd set out to do . Pulled it off slicker'n a goat 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success of his scheme had affectedhim down there , but he hardly cared because he knew that as soon as he could get to Sajie , he was going to have the real thing . Brace did not think beyond what he aimed to do as soon as he could get to Sajie . Duryea sat his horse in the cover of trees for several minutes before he ventured briefly into the open to cross the Manassas Gap Railroad line , which had been mostly in disuse since the opening months of the war . Finally , satisfied that no Reb scouts or pickets waited on the other side , he touched spurs to his horse and trotted over the tracks rusted from long disuse and the ties rotting and overgrown with grass . Within seconds he was covered again by woods on the east side of the right-of-way . Duryea was returning to Pope 's headquarters with word that McDowell and Porter had decided to divide their forces . McDowell was to take his own two divisions , King 's and Ricketts 's , across a narrow road leading from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wider Sudley Springs Road , which ran north to the pike and beyond that to Sudley Springs and Sudley Church . Porter brought forward his guns to bear on the ridge beyond Dawkins Branch ; behind the guns he held his own troops in readiness on the Manassas  --  Gainesville Road . As far as Duryea could tell , McDowell 's intention was to bring his own division roundabout to the left of the line Pope already had established from Groveton to Sudley Springs . When he had thus extended the line toward Porter 's stalled advance , it would become possible , the two generals hoped , for Porter to push ahead and join his right to McDowell 's left . That would stretch Pope 's entire front on a northeast-southwest line from the Manassas Gap Railroad near Dawkins Branch to Sudley Springs.  | " You put your force in here , " Duryea heard McDowell say to Porter , " and I 'll take mine up the Sudley Springs Road . " On McDowell 's instruction , Duryea was taking this information to Pope . Acting on his own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contention that the country lying between Porter 's Corps and Groveton was too wooded and broken to move troops through . Duryea dismounted and led his horse away from the railroad tracks , angling straight north , guiding himself toward Groveton as much by his natural instincts and memory for maps as by the sun . In the thick woods all was still , quiet , except the insects buzzing in his ears ; the distant boom and rattle of battle came dulled through the tangled growth . The early afternoon heat was stifling . He had been prepared to believe that McDowell 's description of the rigors of the terrain had been one more fancy of imaginative generals ; but he soon discovered that Porter 's Corps would have blundered about all day in the brambles and gullies , the boggy little swamps , the thick scrub timber and dangling vines . Even Duryea alone could make better time on foot until he reached cleared ground . As he made his way , Duryea 's anger had turned to depression . He had been too long in the field with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he did know that McClellan had been pulled off the Peninsula ; now here was Pope 's campaign alreadylost  --  Duryea feared  --  owing to that otherwise insignificant notch in the Bull Run Mountains that Pope had failed to block . Much as he hated retreat , Duryea now believed that Pope should get behindBull Run and wait on the Centreville heights for reinforcements from McClellan . To fight Lee 's reunited army with scattered divisions , tired men , and short supplies was to court disaster . They 'd never win the war that way . Never win without a general who wanted to fight and who knew how to fight . But McClellan did n't want to , and it looked as if Pope did n't know how . And even with a general who could win , the troops would have to have something to fight for , the way the secesh fought to hang on to their field hands and concubines . A New England abolitionist to the bone , Duryea had always favored emancipation immediate and total . He had been virtually born to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Underground Railroad to Canada . That August afternoon , as he pushed on through the breathless southern woods , he was ready to believe the war could not be won militarily  --  not with such pudd'nheadgenerals anyway  --  unless it was first won politically by hitting the slavers where they 'd be hurt the most . Free their miserable human property to turn on them . Take their black women away from them . Give our boys a cause to fight for . And show the world what a degenerate dog-killing society it was thatp322had abandoned the old flag to defend its " rights . " Some rights ! Trafficin flesh . Immoral old men selling little girls into a life of degeneracy . Duryea was not too preoccupied with these thoughts to stop instantly and stand motionless as the dead tree on his left when something off-key pierced his consciousness . He was not sure what had done it  --  a sound , or the absence of sound , a movement , an odor , some indefinable sense of something suddenly out of kilter . Slowly he moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds of greeting or alarm . His only other movement was the steady , even turning of his head from left to right as with green , feline eyes he searched the wood for movement , color  --  anything not there by naturalcause . He heard and saw nothing , but his warning instinct was strong . He stood for three minutes , nothing moving but his head and the horse 's tail switching flies . Then , with infinite caution , he moved ahead , careful where he put his feet , and to move branches and rattle the brush as little as possible , no more than a dog trotting through might have , or a wild turkey . As if sensing the necessity , his horse stepped along nearly as silently and just as slowly . After five minutes of this pace , Duryea stood three feet from the edge of the wood bordering the old Warrenton  --  Alexandria Road . A field of corn was on the other side of the rough dirt track , long since relegated to local use by the wider , straighter Warrenton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map sense and instinct told him where he was , within half a mile . If he moved left along the old road , within a few hundred yards the path called Lewis Lane would bear off right  --  north  --  to Groveton and the left wing of Pope 's line . Or , if he went right maybe a mile or more , he 'd come to the Sudley Springs Road at New Market . Longstreet should be sending patrols along the old road , to find out what was on the Federal left . Undoubtedly , that was what had disturbed his sense of things  --  Reb scouts moving on the old road , making some noise . Duryea squinted at the sun . Plenty of time to reach Pope , long before McDowellcould march around by Bethlehem Church . Duryea suddenly was tired of carrying messages , scouting ground , bringing back reportstoo often ignored or disbelieved . Duryea wanted to put a mark on the slavers  --  his mark . He thought of his faithful dog Garrison wantonly killed , and made up his mind . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Longstreet 's scouts had been moving out , away from the Reb lines , to Duryea 's right . If he sat tight , waited a while , they 'd maybe come back along the same road . And maybe with the patrol almost over they 'd be not quite as alert as they ought to be . He moved twenty yards back into the woods , tethered his horsep323behind a tree , then took his Sharps carbine from the saddle holster . Duryea had long ago equipped himself with this cavalry weapon , seventeen inches shorter than the infantry musket , weighing only eight pounds , breech-loading and thus quick-firing . The Sharps lacked accuracy much beyond 150 yards , but Duryea liked to work close in anyway . He checked the linen cartridge in the chamber , moved back to within ten yards of the roadside , and went to ground behind the thick trunk of an oak tree in such a way as to leave a line of fire open to the road . Duryea had to wait five minutes before he sensed the patrol coming back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were five of them . One was walking just within the woods , another a few rows into the cornfield , three in the road itself . Duryea knew before he could see them that they would be alert , with muskets at the half-cock and carried at the ready . But he was willing to gamble that they were just relaxed enough , as they neared their own lines , to give him his chance . He let the man in the woods go past by a yard or two . Then he stood the carbine against the tree , rose and slipped swiftly forward , silent as a squirrel on a limb , clasped his hand over the mouth to stifle a scream , and cut the scout 's throat . Duryea lowered the body silently , retrieved the carbine from behind the tree , and crept to the edge of the road . The three scouts in the road were by then about twenty-five yards beyond him , one on each side , one ahead and in the middle , their heads moving slowly from side to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the near side of the road in the back of the head . While the echo rang , Duryea dived to the ground behind a tree , rolled on his back , pulled down on the trigger guard to expose the still-smoking chamber , inserted another cartridge , and snapped the breechblock closed . Confident that no one looking the other way could have seen the flash of his muzzle and so have pinpointed his location , he rolled over on his stomach , out from behind the tree trunk , and caught a glimpse of a running man only one step from the thin cover of the cornfield . Duryea 's snap shot struck home , he thought , under the left shoulder blade . The Reb pitched forward like a diver into the gray earth of the cornfield and lay still . The bottoms of his bare feet stuck out of the corn rows . Three out of five , Garrison . Good enough . Duryea could hear the other two Rebs thrashing rapidly through the cornstalks but he tried never to overplay his hand . Do what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in omnia paratus . Feeling better , much better , remembering suddenly and for no clear reason the apprehensive black faces with their wide eyes that ,  |p324years  ago , he had seen huddled in his mother 's root cellar , Duryea looked with satisfaction at the body of the Reb scout lying in the road . Scrawny devil . Dog killer . Then he mounted and trotted east on the rutted old road , away from the running men . He was certain that within a half mile he would be able to turn left and strike for Groveton on another country track he remembered from the maps . He 'd be reporting to Pope within the hour , not that that would do anybody much good . Fargo Hart 's road-dragging operation had been quickly succeeded by the real thing . Jones 's Division of Longstreet was moving guns to bear on Dawkins Branch from the ridge where Brace and Henry had watched the skirmishers coming across the field ; and Jones 's brigadeswere posted to cover both the railroad and the wagon road . The rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flank to the Warrenton Pike . So when Major Jesse Thomas saw the Old Man trotting on his gray horse to Longstreet 's headquarters south of the pike , Thomas could guess what was coming . Lee , it had become clear that summer , was no Joe Johnston , retreating , then retreating again , in hopes of finding the perfect defensive position , which of course never appeared . Careful above all to preserve his army , Johnston was . But Lee attacked . Give him half an opening , even the glimmer of a chance , and he 'd spill what blood he had to take advantage of it . Thomas admired that . But he also was impressed with Longstreet'stheory of the " aggressive defensive . " Maneuver yourself , Longstreet preached , into a good defensive position where the enemy had to attack you , but at a disadvantage . Particularly if the enemy had the advantage in numbers , he 'd have to waste it slaughtering his men against a dug-in defense . Thus , an outmanned army like Lee 's should take the strategic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tactical defensive . Watching from the tree against which he was lounging , Thomas could see Lee pointing east along the turnpike . Typical . The battle was that way and the Old Man wanted to get into it . Take the pressureoff Jackson 's left . But within the hour Thomas himself had delivered to 01 Pete scouting reports that said the Federals on the left of Pope 's line  --  Reynolds 's small Pennsylvania division  --  had pulled back from the pike into a strong defensive position on a ridge confrontingLongstreet 's front less than a mile away . Longstreet himself had ridden out near enough Reynolds 's new position to gauge its strength . So Thomas was not surprised to see Longstreet shaking his head vigorously , although Lee seemed to bep325persisting in urging attack . The major knew that a frontal assault on Reynolds would stand Longstreet 's " aggressive defensive " theory on its head . Worse , some kind of Yank force was confronting Jones 's guns on Longstreet 's right flank , out there on the Manassas Road . Porter 's Corps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 01 Pete had pointed out to his staff , forcing Reynolds back from the pike and into a defensive position already had lifted his pressure from Jackson 's right ; so Longstreet 's mere presence on the field had afforded Jackson some relief . " Look like 01 Pete 's got his muleskin on . " A young captain who had ridden in with Lee 's escort group had drifted near Thomas 's tree , holding a tin cup of coffee from the headquarters pot . Thomas recognized him as the staff captain , Franklin , who had had the good fortune to sit by Miss Letty at Dabney Williams 's dinner table . " Oh , well . " Thomas still envied Franklin that seat  --  envied , too , his easy Virginia grace and his two good hands . Strange to think it was to him , one-handed Jesse Thomas , not to this handsome young aristocrat , that Miss Letty had sent Lawrence with her handkerchief . " I reck'n Gin'al Lee 's kind of strong-natured himself . " " Sure is . " Franklin sipped coffee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . You fellows boil up of brogans over here , or what ? " " Horseshit , mostly . " Let'im choke on that , Thomas thought . Fop if I ever seen one . " What we do . . . , " Franklin 's voice was serious , " is mix it half horseshit'n half gunpowder . Gives it body . " Thomas grinned , only a little grudgingly . " 01 Pete still shakin'is head , Cap'n . He looked over that ground out there in front of us himself . Did n't much like it . " Franklin glanced over his shoulder at the two generals , Lee austere , gray with dust and reserve ; Longstreet heavy , dark , immovable . " Then the 01 Man wo n't order it . But he sure wants to give Jackson a hand . " Thomas could not be sure , as he watched Longstreet shake his head again , whether young Franklin had subtly stressed the " he " in that last sentence . Likely he had , and Thomas resented it . But he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not attack that afternoon . A mile and a half southeast , just behind the ridge from which Jones 's guns now pointed at Dawkins Branch and Porter 's quiescent Federal corps , Jeb Stuart and his staff were riding out to the south . They were well beyond both the railroad and the wagon road from Man/assas to Gainesville , as they looked for General Beverley Robertson on the extreme right flank of the Confederate line . Robertson had the reputation of being an excellent drillmaster who tended to lose his composure in battle . Jackson and Stuart were known  --  that is , they were rumored over the camp fire  --  to have little use for him ; but Lee , whose judgment mattered most , was thought to have refused to relieve him . With Porter 's Corps now reported at Dawkins Branch , clearly menacing Longstreet 's flank , Stuart obviously was checking up on Robertson 's cavalry dispositions . But the bald and mustachioed Robertson had his pickets well out , his patrols active , and his troopers in hand ; not even the demandingStuart could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference between the two young generals  --  the precociousStuart not yet 30 , Robertson a comparatively ripe 36-Hart , the Reverend Major Allen , and Coke Mowbray spurred to the crest of the ridge for a look at the Yanks . Beyond Dawkins Branch , stretching as far as the eye could see along the road to Manassas , blue troops stood in seemingly endless ranks , regiment upon regiment , brigade following brigade . Three quarters of a mile distant , over the east bank of the branch  --  a substantialstream at that point  --  Porter 's guns glistened in the sun , a menacing line of batteries on either side of the wagon road . " Christ-amighty , " Mowbray said . " Look at ... " " Watch your blasphemous tongue ! " " Yeah , sorry , Rev'rend . Meant to say . . . uh , Great Scott , they 's a lot of'em , ai nt they ? " " May God smite'em hip and thigh ! " The Reverend Major 's God , Hart thought again , was not one whose attentions he particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's booming voice , one of the Federal pieces across the branch emitted a cotton-boll puff of white smoke ; a shell screamed toward the spot on the ridge where they sat their horses . The flat brrumpp of the cannon rolled across the open ground behind the shell , which rattled harmlessly through the treetops above them . " Yanks ca n't hit . . . " Mowbray was saying gaily , when a heavily falling branch cracked the Reverend Major 's horse squarely across its muzzle . The animal shied , then reared in fright and pain ; and the corpulentReverend Major , never more than an adequate horseman , tumbled backwards from the saddle . Just as he went off , the horse 's forelegs came down and the beast bolted forward . The jangling spur on the Reverend 's right boot caught in a tangle of leather straps , saddlebag , and canteen hanging below the rolled buffalo robe behind the saddle . Hart had been leaning nonchalantly on Mercury 's neck ; but inp327the instant that he saw Allen 's horse drag the Reverend 's heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddle , his fingers transmitted instinctive orders through the reins , his spurs touched the black flank so lightly that Mercury could barely have felt the prick . The horse leaped after Allen 's mount and the struggling body being dragged head down through the underbrush . The Yank cannon puffed again ; another shell screamed overhead . Hart scarcely noticed as he stood in his stirrups and leaned out to his right , his lithe body stretched to its utmost reach . Above the beat of hooves , he could hear the Reverend Major 's head and shoulders bumping over the rough ground like a caisson with a brokenwheel , and his grunts and wheezes of pain and exertion . Then Hart 's grasping fingers closed on the bolting horse 's halter strap , and within a few yards he had tugged it to a trembling stop . The Federal cannon threw a third shell screaming at them , and this one chewed into the ground and showered dirt and litter all around . Coke Mowbray , only a length behind Hart , had leaped from his saddle the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he disengaged Allen 's spur and pulled the Reverend away from his frightened horse 's hooves . " Major . . . y'all right ? " Hart was dismounting as he heard the hoarse whisper from the ground : " ... Lord be praised ... Our Father . . . bath spared His servant . " Hart promptly swung back into the saddle . " That bein the case ... " He watched Mowbray fingering the Reverend 's bruised and bleeding head . " Why n't we just let the Lord haul His servant 's ass out of here ? " Sam Stowe , bleeding from a cut on the cheekbone where some Yank 's lashing rifle barrel had given him a glancing blow , plumped out his crushed hat as best he could and stuck it defiantly back on his head . Stowe had been in the thick of the struggle after the Yanks swarmed over Hoke Arnall 's line . He had had no experience of hand-to-hand fighting either , but it had by no means so exhilarated him as it had his brigadier . Stabbing and clubbing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was confident that he had done his share of damagewith the saber that had been his only weapon , he had found the business distasteful in the extreme , as he would have a tavern brawl . Nothing about it of courage or skill or science ; a brute struggle for survival . Stowe wanted to lead men , not join them in braining each ot her . But Arnall ! Stowe had caught sight of the General cutting hisp328way out of the mob , Colt in one hand and saber in the other , terrifyingin his strength and fury , some sixth sense seeming to give him warning of any attacker from whatever quarter , magically conferringon him immunity from blasting muzzles and thrusting bayonets . In that glimpse Stowe had realized that beneath his stiff militaryposture Hoke Arnall was a man of passion and animality , born to war in its most elementary form  --  man against man . Now that Branch 's rescuing regiments had helped drive the Yanks back over the railroad cut , Arnall  --  not pausing for a moment  --  had reverted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under continuing battle pressure , with the Yanks keeping up heavy musket fire on the railroad cut , the General had swiftly reformedhis regiments , got runners on the way for ammunition and the wounded moving back to Sudley Church ; now he was striding along the lip of the cut , stiffening his troops with his words and presence . From the rail fence where his regiment had once again taken post , Colonel Stowe watched Arnall in admiration newly edged with apprehension . The energy , the command in his voice , the decision in his manner  --  no question but the man was a leader . But Stowe 's glimpse of the brawling fighter underneath had been unsettling , as if he had seen a splendid hound suddenly turned mad dog . Stowe particularly wished Arnall had n't been so quick to send Branch 's regiments back to reserve . The Yanks would be coming again , and sooner or later over the field beyond the fence . He gazed up at the sun . Seem like it had n't moved since the last time he checked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known time to pass so slowly . But to Hoke Arnall the day had seemed more nearly the tick of a clock , events moving as swiftly as troops charging , and as blurred in his mind as glimpses of the field through smoke drifts . Everything seemed speeded up and heightened in intensity . His long stride seemed to carry him everywhere swiftly , without effort . " Hold fire , men ! " he shouted above the infernal clatter of Yank muskets from the woods . " Do n't waste your shot ... do n't shoot unless you can look down their throats ! " He was seriously worried about ammunition , half a day 's nearly ceaseless firing having all but emptied his men 's cartridge boxes . " A Yank for a bullet , boys . . . one Yank , one bullet ! " But the one fact that dominated Arnall 's hyperactive consciousnesswas that the Yanks had broken his line . That would go in Hill 's report , too . Branch had had to restore his line , expunging the memory of the morning 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The enemy had broken his line , and Arnall burnedp329with unholy zeal to remove that blemish , redeem his record  --  with faith that God 's instrument could not fail . " Folsom ! " Even as he called for the orderly , his ear picked up a faint diminutionin the volume of fire from the woods . " Rightchere , Gin'al ! " " Folsom . . . need cottridges . For the Colt . Get a move on ! " Were the Yanks pulling back ? Or had some of them , maybe a regiment , for some reason ceased fire ? Corporal Gilmore watched as Folsom dashed off toward the General 's saddlebags . He had been pleased all morning to see that even such a poet-type seemed to have a good head and steady nerves . In the mob struggle with the Yanks , Gilmore had had no time or chance to look out for him ; but after Branch had run off the Yanks and Gilmore found time to check , there the boy was , cool as a cucumber , right where he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved along at a discreet distance behind the General , who 'd hardly stood still all morning . Like Stowe , Gilmore admired Arnall the soldier , if not always the man . And today , the corporal thought , he 'd been at his best . Not a brigade in the Army could have taken such a pounding and stood in the same tracks it had been in at dawn . Every webfoot'n at line , he thought , know he gone feel a boot'n'is rear , he start givin ground on Ironass . Suddenly , six feet in front of him , Gilmore saw General Arnall stop and his body go rigid in attention . Then his saber swept above his head and his hoarse roar rose above the continuing Yank musketry : " In the cut ! Yanks in the cut ! " Arnall began to run . " By the right flank , boys ... fire ! By the right flank . . . fire ! " Teddy Redmund , noting that it was half past one , wondered why the blues had taken so long to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrunken brigade and the next one to his right . The Federals had been keeping up a steady small-arms fire on both brigades , and on still another just to the right of them . But all day the gap in the line had waited there , like a missing tooth . Redmund watched from his perch behind Hill 's line as at least two regiments of blues poured out of the woods directly in front of the gap and charged into the railway cut . Yes Redmund thought bloody yes moving blue pieces on Sertorius 's chessboard . If the blue generals had them lined up in the woods to keep coming throughp330that gap and into the cut , Arnold was done for , cut off , and isolated for the kill . And Jackson 's left was decisively turned . The same thoughts flashed through Hoke Arnall 's head as he saw the first Yank riflemen charging into the cut . Instinctively , he had ordered the nearest troops to face right and fire at them , but he knew that men surprised on the flank were at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few muskets to bear at one end of their line . Besides , the Yanks seemed at first glance numberless . Might be coming in on his front again , too . Or across the field on Stowe . Maybe both . " Gilmer ! " " Yessuh ! " " Bring Sparks . . . quick ! While they 're still in the cut ! " Arnall did not even look around to see if the corporal understood . He knew his men and that even before he 'd got the words out of his mouth Gilmore was running . Nor had he needed to give detailedorders for Sparks ; Sparks knew how to send a regiment into a fight . Hoke Arnall had taught him , and God would be at his side . " Give it to'em ! " Arnall shouted at the front-line riflemen , squared around now toward the Yanks in the cut to their right . " Pour it in ! " He ran along the line , toward the blue mass up ahead . Bayonet . Give'em the bayonet if they come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rear of Dixon 's Rifles , Foxy Bradshaw had faced right with the rest of the regiment but was too paralyzed with fear to do more . Foxy had clenched himself facedownagainst the bank of the cut throughout the fight behind the knoll and now was completely unnerved by the flank attack . Beside him some yelling butternut fired ; the flash singed Foxy 's neck and he fell away against the bank just as Josh Beasly stepped out of the line . Josh took two or three steps into the clear and went down on one knee , sighting his rifled musket along the line of the cut . Foxy almost forgot his fear , in the instinct that , this time , Josh was not drawing down on no Yank . Sonomabitch . Josh saw he had an absolutely clear shot . Ironass reared up over everbody else . Like he think bullets do n't hit gin'als . Arnall was running away from Josh , but in a straight line toward the Yanks . Josh could hit a running rabbit with a rifled ball at better than 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the range on Ironass just above fifty yards but opening fast . Sonomabitch buck me the la-a-ast time . Josh 's finger tightened on the trigger . Something light but forceful fetched him a hard blow in hisp331back , with just enough impact to tip a kneeling man off balance . Josh lurched forward and to his right , as the hammer fell on the fulminate cap . As he had planned , the sound of the shot was absorbed in the battle noise ; but the barrel of his piece rose as he fell , and the ball flew harmlessly into the trees above the Yanks . Josh broke his fall with his elbow . He thought at first he must have been hit by a spent Yank bullet . His brain focused slowly and he realized that whatever had happened had ruined his bead on Ironass . Never get a chancet like at again . Josh stood up . He had n't been hit after all . He was angry at the ruined shot but still it had not occurred to him that somebody had ruined it , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody he knew gave a shit for Ironass . He looked around to see what had hit him . " He done it ! Snotnose done it ! " Josh 's eyes followed Foxy 's pointingfinger . Larkin Folsom , trotting back with a linen bag of cartridges from General Arnall 's saddlebags , had seen Arnall running toward the right . The orderly could see that the Yanks had cracked the line again and in the confusion of events this development meant to him only that the General needed his cartridges more than ever . Folsom quickly started after him  --  a dutiful young man not at all oblivious to whizzingbullets or to the dead and wounded around him , but one who , had he had time to analyze his actions , would have feared injury less than failing his obligations . He was , moreover , so young and full of life that he was unable to realize or even imagine the arrant vulnerabilityof man to man , and man to chance . He ran on with the bag of cartridges in his hand , coming up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sights on Arnall . Folsom froze in his tracks . He knew the common gossip that certain hated officers like Arnall had been " spotted . " He could tell that the kneeling man was taking careful aim at somebody , not merely firing at the mass of bluecoats in the cut . He saw Arnall 's back as clear and exposed as the killing sun overhead . Reflexively , as he would have tried to ward off a blow , Folsom threw the sack of cartridges as hard as he could at the kneeling man 's back . Only when the man stood up and his yellow-edged eyes , followingsomeone 's pointing finger , finally fixed on him did Larkin Folsom understand what he had done with such absence of calculation . He stood staring into those eyes no more than a moment ; then , fearful as he had never been made by war , he began to step backward , not looking away from the big man drawing the bayonet from his belt . Cut'is goddam heart out . Josh felt the razor-like steel in his hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not concerned with whop332might be watching . He gave no thought to consequences ; he never did . Josh was a simple man , direct as a hammer . Ruint my shot . Cut'is heart out . Folsom knew he could outrun the man with the yellow eyes , or anybody . He took another step backward , just before breaking into a run , and tripped over Lige Flournoy 's outstretched leg . Folsom went down thrashing his arms , falling heavily whuff. ' on his back and shoulders . Josh jumped forward , but not as Lige expected . He went down face first in the dirt , just short of Lige 's boot , the back of his head suddenly a red and spurting mess . Lige could not have distinguished any one shot in the thousands popping all around him in harsh continuous detonation . But he knew what a .58-caliber ball did to the back of a man 's head . With the string of dried apples still around his neck , Lige looked beyond Josh 's body and saw Corporal Amon Gilmore , his musket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards of ground , the two big men gazed steadily at one another . Several men in Dixon 's Rifles , probably some of McCrary 's South Carolinians , had seen what Josh Beasly had been about to do . Nobodybut Folsom had tried to stop him . Some had wished Arnall dead , too . Others had not cared , or feared Josh , or were immobilized by the continuing battle , or did not wish to be involved . Most had seen Josh fall and some understood that Corporal Gilmore , not some Yank , had put the bullet in Josh 's head . But all of them , Gilmore and Lige included , knew that nothing would be done about any of it . Troops were not going to inform on one another when the surfeit of death made one more , and the manner of its coming , seem inconsequential . Nobody would be charged , nobody punished  --  unless one of the two men staring at one another across the littered ground behind Arnall 's front took action against the other . Arnall himself was cheering Sparks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor Gilmore feared the other , or anyone , and least of all the army . But they were different men . Amos Gilmore wanted to look out for the boy ; but Lige Flournoy did not give a hoot in hell whether Josh or any of the meat in the regiment lived or died , or how . He had only tripped up the snotnose to keep the fun going a little longer . To hell with it , Lige thought , turning his attention back to the fight . In a war , a man fought because it was there to be done , and everybody sooner or later got to be a deader . So what difference it made how you got snuffed , or when , Lige failed to see . As he started to move forward to get his crack at the Yanks inp333the cut , he saw Foxy Bradshaw headed for the rear , limping as if he had a leg wound . Lige laughed soundlessly at the notion . Nothin ther to hit , he thought . Bullet 'd sail right thew at sack-a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue attack from the cut being pinched between a regiment thrown in on one side by Arnold and another pushed in from the butternut brigade on Arnold'sright . Not that Redmund cared whether blue or butternut brought the game to check ; but it grieved him professionally to see such an opportunitywasted . The blues  --  given their daylong ineptitude  --  predictablyhad had nothing in reserve to exploit their sudden possession of the cut , just as all morning they had sent in one attack after another , one assault wave here , one there , yet had never coordinated the weight of their forces , never hit the outmanned butternuts a killing blow after first having knocked them off balance . And over there on the left , toward Bull Run , masses of blues in the woods and beyond were letting themselves be stalled by Hill 's guns instead of coming on in concert with the blue brigades in the woods in front of Arnold . As the last of the Federal troops  --  New Yorkers and Pennsylvanians from Krzyzanowski 's Brigade  --  were struggling out of the cut and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General John Pope , U.S.A. , and his staff rode up Buck 's Hill , just behind the Stone House at the intersection of the Warrenton Pike and the Manassas  --  SudleyRoad . Over Buck 's Hill , a year earlier , green Reb troops had hastened from positions around the Stone Bridge to a new line on Matthews Hill , confronting McDowell 's attempted flanking movement of equally green Yanks . But no one with Pope , that early afternoon of August 29 , 1862 , either knew that history or would have cared much about it if he had . Instead , the general and his staff gathered around a solitary pine tree on the crest of Buck 's Hill , from which they could gaze west and north over the whole line of battle , even obscured as the view was by smoke and dust . Many of the officers flinched as the pounding of artillery , the ceaseless crash of musketry , rolled over the fields in tangible waves , percussion as well as sound . Immediately to the front , on Matthews Hill , more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cass Fielding thought . A blue brigade rested on its arms behind the line of guns . Hooker 's Division stretched endlessly off to the right toward Sudley Springs , in battle line ; beyond it , somebody told Fielding , Kearny 's Division was reaching around Jackson 's left . To the left of the guns , Sigel 's infantry was milling about , many of its men trickling back wounded or exhausted from the woods between them and the Reb line , which was marked only by white smoke rising above Sudley Mountain . Beyond Sigel , on the south side of the pike , blue troops not actively engaged appeared to Fielding to be resting on a hillside . Here and there , in the open fields , the dry broomsedge had caught fire and burned uncertainly in the breezelessheat , sending a thinner smoke than that of gunpowder into the hard blue sky . Reynolds 's Division of Pennsylvanians , on the left of Pope 's line south of the pike , faced west behind a slight ridge topped with trees . At the east foot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meandering track led north to Groveton . So well-placed a vantage point was Buck 's Hill that Fielding , had he been using field glasses , could have seen Captain Micah G. Duryea riding along that track on his way to report to Pope . But Fielding could not appreciate the magnificent spectacle of fire and destruction , much less notice small details , because of the Reb shells shrieking over the hill or ploughing into its gravelly surfacewith a rasping , gouging sound that made his flesh creep . Duckingaway from one such shell bursting twenty feet to his left , he saw another strike the span between two battery horses and explode , carrying away a foreleg of one and a hind leg of the other . The maimed and screaming horses hopped and leaped for a moment in a circle , like dancers waltzing drunkenly . They circled each other several times in ghastly ritual , before one went down spouting blood , dragging the other with him . But each lurched erect again for one more wheel around the other . Then , still harnessed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fielding could not think what this hideous death duet called to mind . Something.  |p335Albert  Stevens Hale came out of the White House , and stoodfor a moment under the north portico wondering whether tocross the lawn to the War Department to call on AssistantSecretary Watson . Then he decided that first he had to think through the startling information President Lincoln himself had just confided . Hale set off quickly for his office on Twelfth Street . Even in the tropical heat of a Washington afternoon , his step was brisk and he was dressed in a heavy , rather formal suit . His tall black hat could not counter the fact that he was a small man . The President , escortinghim to the door of his office , could almost have held an arm straight out over Hale 's thinning hair . Lucky thing he had sent in his card at just the right moment , Hale thought . He had n't expected to see Lincoln , had merely scribbledon the card : " News from Pope ? " Most times the President replied to journalists who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer on the back of the card ; occasionally , however , he called the questioner in for a chat . " You newspapermen are so often behind the scenes at the front , " he 'd told Williams of The Times , " I frequently get ideas from you that no one else can give . " Hearing that , Forney of the Washington Chronicle had complained , " When I go to see him , he asks me what 's the last good joke I heard . " Hale 's own experience suggested that the President 's favorite question was , " What news have you ? " He often felt more interviewed than informed after a talk with the genial , humorous man who bore the weight of the war on his bony shoulders . Hale was a Republican and an abolitionist who had slowly come to respect the President ; but he was Washington bureau chief for a New York newspaper that was making no bones about its impatience at the slow progress of the war . And Hale shared his employer 's view that Lincoln was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really what the struggle was about ? Saying so plainly would transform a civil war into what was needed  --  a moral crusade . But Lincoln appeared not to grasp the overwhelming sentimentof the country for emancipation . Everybody knew that he 'd told Senator Charles Sumner that a decree freeing the slaves would be " too big a lick . " To which the caustic Secretary Stanton was known to have replied  --  thoughnot to the President 's face  --  that the country " wanted big licks now . " As Hale hurried through the midafternoon heat and the stench of the sewage canal that ran below the White House and near the stump of the unfinished monument to Washington , he was more than usually anxious to get at his daily confidential report to New York . A nervous , bespectacled man , nearsighted and constantly worrying about his health , Hale was , for all that , an incessant worker . He organized and coordinated , as well as anyone could , the work of his paper 's correspondents in the field ; and one of his worries at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the other correspondents had been forced by Halleck 's order to separate themselves from Pope 's Army of Virginia , Keach simply had not returned with them , nor had he been heard from since . The bureau chief also cultivated some of the most important news sources in Washington  --  Secretary of State Seward , Secretary of the Treasury Chase , Assistant War Secretary Watson ( Hale detestedStanton and sought out his deputy instead ) , Speaker Colfax , Representatives Covode and Washburne , Senator Sumner , General Wadsworth , and not infrequently the President himself . All contributed , more than they knew , not only to Hale 's long and informed dispatches about the government and the conduct of the war , but also to his nightly private report to his editor , Stanley Glenn , in New York . Just a few nights before , Hale had been able to write Glenn privately  --  though carefully masking his source , Secretary of the Navy Welles  --  that Lincoln had completed the draft of an EmancipationProclamation three weeks before . He could not tell Glenn why its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassedthe next day , when Lincoln 's reply to Greeley 's " Prayer of Twenty Million " had been printed in the New York Tribune : I would save the Union . If there be those who would not save the Union , unless they could at the same time save slavery , I do not agree with them . If there be those who would not save the Union , unless they could at the same time destroy slavery , I do not agree with them . My paramountobject in this struggle is to save the Union and is not either top337save or destroy slavery . If I could save the Union without freeing any slave , I would do it , and if I could save the Union by freeing some and leaving others alone , I would also do that . . . Hale had perfect confidence in his impressive source , who assuredhim the Proclamation was indeed down on paper in Lincoln 's own hand  --  the product of a summer 's secret work in the Telegraph Office . But that was not the same as having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter to Greeley had damaged his  --  Hale 's  --  standing with Stanley Glenn . So when the President , instead of sending back Hale 's card with a line or two in response , had invited him in for a talk , Hale had quickly decided to press the emancipation question . But he never got the chance ; for the first time in Hale 's experience , Lincoln was in a wrathful mood . Hardly offering civil welcome , he held up a telegram from General McClellan and began to excoriate the general for dragginghis feet in sending reinforcements out to Pope . " He 's acted badly toward Pope . " Lincoln draped one of his long legs over the arm of his chair . " He really wanted him to fail . " Lincoln had stopped short of showing McClellan 's telegram to Hale ; apparently just received , it seemed to have set off the President'stirade . But he did read aloud the operative sentence , inflecting his high-pitched voice sarcastically : " I am clear that one of two courses should be adopted : first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Pope ; second , to leave Pope to get out of his scrape , and at once to use all our means to make the capital perfectly safe . " Leave Pope to get out of his scrape ! Hale would have found the phrase shocking even had he not already come to regard George B. McClellan as a general moved more by personal ambition than by patriotism . His telegram amounted to a proposal to leave a Federal army to fend for itself against forces of unknown size and disposition . Even without these indiscretions , the telegram  --  as Hale pieced together the story from Lincoln 's remarks  --  was an act of insubordination . In it McClellan appeared to have gone over Halleck 's head to Lincoln in an effort to hold back some troops the general in chief had ordered out to Pope . " I tell you , Hale , there 's been a design , a purpose , in breaking down Pope without regard to the consequences to the country . " Lincolnsmacked his open palm on his desk . " That 's atrocious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at present . McClellan has the army with him . " Hale had never had such a story ; but all correspondents understood that private conversations with Lincoln were never to be at/tributed to him . And he certainly could n't publish without documentationwhat the President had seemed plainly to be suggesting  --  that Major General George B. McClellan and his toady generals had acted to cause Major General John Pope to be defeated by the Rebels  --  at the least had declined to assist him . As Hale crossed Fourteenth Street , he was calculating how best to use this startling information . In the nightly letter to Glenn , of course  --  though he 'd have to ponder whether or not to disclose even confidentially that the news was directly from Lincoln himself . Then , tomorrow , he 'd get busy with War Department officials to see if he could use his information to drag the story out of them in publishableform . Maybe Watson would open up . Of course , he had to allow for the fact that Lincoln was being driven to distraction by the lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for four days . The President could be seizing on McClellan as a scapegoat  --  which put Hale in mind of his own frustration . " Where the devil 's that Keach ? " he muttered , causing an old gentleman passing by to stare at him suspiciously . But Hale was too single-minded to notice or to give further thought to Keach ; he hurried on , anxious to put everything down in his nightly letter . At first , Privates Sowell and Stone thought Lott McGrath was dead after all . In the thinning woods near the top of Sudley Mountain , he lay nearly prone under a pine tree , hatless , his eyes closed and his face pale above his familiar red-checked shirt . Gilly was awed at the sight . " Do n't go no closer , Sowbelly . Ai nt natchral , no dead body gittin itself way up here . " " He ai nt dead , dammit . Ca n't be . " But Sowell , too , was for a moment reluctant to go nearer Lott 's sprawled form . " Lessen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Lott opened his eyes and stared at them . Gilly started to back away . " Didn I tell you ? " Sowell grabbed Gilly 's arm . " Thachew , Lott ? " McGrath lay still , looking at them , no sign of recognition on hisface . Sowell stepped forward , pulling the reluctant Gilly along . " Lookin fer y'all day , Lott . How come yuh way up-yere ? " Lott 's dull eyes watched their creeping approach . " Yeah . " Gilly was emboldened , the closer they got . " Thought y'uz snuffed till Applejack said he seen yuh. "  |p339Lott  's eyes did not move , nor did he blink as they approached . Then Gilly and Sowell saw the bullet hole , black as a piece of coal , at Lott 's hairline just to the left of his left eye . " Sho-God tuck a good un , Lott . Inch to the right , you-uz a gone goose . " Sowell knelt by Lott 's left side and examined the wound . He could see that the slug had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another neat hole behind his ear ; but it appeared just barely to have burrowed under the skin before emerging again . " Did n't I say he uz lucky ? " Gilly sounded almost aggrieved . " Gone git'im a leave outten it . " Sowell touched the side of Lott 's head between the bullet holes , to see if Lott would flinch . He did n't move or make a sound . No blood either . " Dawg if I ever seen the beat . " Sowell stood up . Lott lay still as a stone . " Le 's git'im to the bonecrackers . " " Carry'im ? " " He walk up yere , he kin walk down . Git a holt of'is arm ther . " Lott , obedient as a child , rose to his feet with their help . Hestared into the blue distance , seeming to notice neither of them . " Kin yuh walk if we lend a hand ? " Sowell gently urged Lott down the ridge . Lott began to walk , steadily enough , with their hands guiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but after a rod or two , Sowell stopped . " Gilly , you got a feelin he 'd walk smack into a tree lessen we steered'im round it ? " Lott was staring straight ahead , his eyes and face as blank as the bottom of a cook pot . Gilly waved his hand in front of Lott 's eyes . " Hell , I believe he 's dead'n do n't know it yit . " " Shit , " Sowell said . " Le 's git'im on down to the docs . " " Gim me a funny feelin . " But Gilly took the other arm , and Lott walked on obediently between them . Miraculously , Phil Keefe 's leg had not had to be amputated . The round , soft lead ball that had struck Keefe had lost its shape on impact , expanded , tumbled , and carried rags of his trousers into his body . The low-velocity ball , instead of piercing cleanly , mangled his flesh , tore up the big muscles in the back of his calf , and cost him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball 's lacerating track had not shattered a long bone ; it had not exploded bone splinters and shards randomly around the wound in numbers impossible to remove , each one a probable sourcep340of infection . With his leg bones intact , Keefe might make it without resort to the saw  --  or so the tired surgeon who had examined him concluded . Any other medical officer in Hooker 's hospital might have had the leg off as quickly as he could have said " chloroform . " That was easier than treating the wound , and the surgeons were busy and exhausted ; after a year of war , many were cynical about arms and legs . But young Jude Israel , the doctor who treated Keefe , was a newcomer to war and his profession , and still idealistic . He believed , moreover , in innovative techniques , practicing them when he could . He owned one of the few clinical thermometers in the whole Union medical corps . And before repairing , closing , and dressing the terriblerent in Keefe 's leg , Captain Israel had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syringe in the field hospital  --  the young surgeon 's own property . The needle was considered too newfangled by most of his colleagues , who preferred to dust morphineinto an open wound , or to use opium pills to relieve pain . But slowly the morphine had worn off . Keefe came to nightmare consciousness while bouncing along a rutted road in a two-wheeled ambulance . The canvas-topped vehicle was arranged for four stretcher cases , two on its bed and two overhead in racks , one of whom was Phil Keefe . Both front and rear flaps were down and little air could penetrate , so the baleful Virginia sun turned the ambulance into a furnace for its passengers . Keefe had no notion where he was or even that he was in an ambulance , since nothing that rocked and swayed and bounced so much could have been thought to have been intended for succor . In fact , the army had adopted the two-wheeled ambulance only because it was light enough to be drawn by one horse . And horses were too sorely needed by the cavalry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wounded . At first Keefe thought he might be dead and in Hell , so fierce was the heat and so noxious the smells of that canvas inferno ; and he could think of no other explanation for the torturous jolting and jostling and the searing pain spreading from his leg through his body . But Phil Keefe was a regular churchgoer who had tried all his life to abide by the Ten Commandments , and it seemed monstrously unfair that he should have gone to hell . Besides , he finally recognized through his sweating agony that the familiar rhythmic sound punctuatingthe horrid groans around him  --  some of them his own  --  was that of a trotting horse . Keefe knew no horse would ever be sent to hell . Then he realized the horse was pulling the torture chamber in which he was riding . His consciousness , after that , consisted of painp341and the knowledge that he was alive and going somewhere . As had the sense of being on the road the night before , that knowledge sustainedhim . If he was still alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay alive ; if he was going someplace , it had to be better than where he was . Actually , the hospital depot to which Keefe was being transported , though scarcely a spa , consisted of a decent village of tent flies pitched in and near a cool grove on a hillside just east of Bull Run , not far from Blackburn 's Ford . Trees gave some shelter from the sun and pine straw provided an aromatic ground cover . This was the Army of Virginia 's central hospital on August 29 , 1862 . That afternoon it was not yet quite swamped with wounded because many of those who had gone down in Brawner 's pasture the night before were in the hands of the Rebs , and most of those injured in the morning 's attacks on Jackson 's left had not yet been moved back from the regimental surgeries . But the depot 's surgeons , nurses , and orderlies knew they were facing a long night ; to brace themselves , some freely sampled from bottles of medicinal spirits . Alreadythe sights and sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded clenched their teeth and smothered their own groans , making a more terrible sound than those of the less stoical . Some laughed the harsh , mirthless rasp of the hopeless . Stretchers and ambulances were beginning to come in bloody procession across Bull Run , and the surgeons with their dripping hands and gory aprons were turning out row upon row of tormented men , some mutilated as much by medical tools as by shot or shell . Chaplain E. P. Hornby , who had lain all night by the side of the Warrenton Pike in immediate danger of being crushed by any passingwagon or caisson , had been found just after dawn by men of Reynolds 's Division . Owing to his chaplain 's insignia , the Pennsylvanianshad given him preferred treatment ; their surgeon dressed his wounds , set his broken leg , and dosed him liberally with opium pills . Although no one knew where Hatch 's Brigade or the TwentyfourthNew York might be , Chaplain Hornby had been carried about noon into the hospital depot near Blackburn 's Ford and made as comfortable as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opium . He drifted in and out of sleep in sudden steep rushes ; sometimes colors swirled vividly in his head or caught him up like the waters of a polychrome sea . In moments of wakefulness , he was acutely conscious of the groans and cries around him , and sometimes these carried over into the smoky world of dreams into which he repeatedlyfloated . Hornby had never been under opiate before , or even the influ/ence of alcohol , which was forbidden by his calling . Possibly the drug unhinged his brain temporarily . Possibly it pried under his prim habits of thought and deed . Possibly opium and the pain it only partially dulled unveiled the faint shapes of visions that had been suppressed in religious sentiment , or rejected by the high moral character upon which he had always congratulated himself . In any case , sometime in the afternoon , while Phil Keefe 's stretcher was being placed on the pine straw not far away , Chaplain Hornby emerged from an opium-tinted dreamworld with a rending groan , a welling cry of despair , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul upon which rested his life and understandingmight have been torn out of him by Lucifer 's own hand . A passing surgeon hurried to the chaplain 's side ; and Private Keefe , whose own tortured body was by then almost clear of morphine , pitied with all his youthful heart the torment of a man who could utter such a sound . But the concerned surgeon could find no cause for alarm , save perhaps the copious perspiration in which Chaplain Hornby was bathed . The broken leg was properly splinted ; water was dripping as it should upon the dressing of the arm wound . The chaplain 's look of haunted fear was common enough in the eyes of men mangled in battle . And since it was natural that the thoughts of those in anguish should turn to their loved ones the surgeon saw nothing strange in Hornby 's murmuring , through clenched jaws , again and again : " Sally . . . Sally ... " And once : " Sally . . . not what you thought ! " " Sponge off his forehead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give'im two opium pills . " Few men could recall a sun so hot , or so slow to slide across the blued-steel sky . In its relentless rays , on and on through the creeping afternoon , Pope 's blue waves dashed intermittently against 01 Jack 's thinning lines on the left and center . Even after Arnall and Thomas forced Krzyzanowski 's men from their threatening position in the railroad cut , no letup came . Hooker'sand Reno 's divisions of Peninsula veterans immediately relieved Sigel 's used-up corps , which since dawn had been throwing itself on Jackson in brave but disjointed attacks . Reno struck at about 2 p.m . A brigade of New Hampshire , Pennsylvania , and Maryland regiments attacked just west of the road from Sudley Springs to Groveton crossroads , near where the oldp343railroad right-of-way crossed that road . These fresh troops crashed into the Reb line and got over the embankment  --  two to three feet high and heavily defended at the point of attack . But Ewell 's Division , under Lawton , rallied quickly and the Federal commander , Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a loss of 531 men killed , wounded , or missing . A. P. Hill , meanwhile , having perceived at last the danger of the gap between Arnall and Thomas , had sent Pender 's Brigade to fill it . Then the combative Hill  --  sparing Arnall 's hard-hit ranks on the left  --  threw Thomas and Pender against Hooker 's newly formed battleline . The unexpected Reb attack hit Colonel Joseph B. Carr 's New York and New Jersey Brigade so hard that its repulse also carried back Colonel Nelson Taylor 's Brigade . Pender and Thomas then returned to their stronghold in the railroad cut , leaving a thicker carpetof bodies on its blood-slicked approaches . But Joe Hooker was a fighter . At 3 p.m. he ordered a New Englandbrigade under Brigadier General Cuvier Grover to attack not far from where Nagel 's troops had briefly spilled over the embankment . Grover was ordered to carry the embankment and hold a position in the woods beyond it . The guns of both armies had been roaring for hours , making the earth shake and the air shimmer with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods and fields , the meandering lanes , the dreary farm houses . Muskets often grew so hot in the barrel that men dropped them , picked up those of the dead , and fought on . At the slightest pause , butternut scarecrows hopped like carrion birds from Jackson 's lines to scavenge the cartridges of the fallen , friend and enemy alike . As the day wore endlessly on , men on both sides dropped from heat exhaustion and lay as useless as the riddled bodies around them . Dry lips sucked canteens empty ; the acrid smoke , the churning dust streaked live faces as black as those of the sun-bloated dead in Brawner 's field . Before the old railway , blue bodies lay thick as wildflowers ; behind it , butternut corpses lined the bottom of the cut like sandbags supporting a levee . Attackers coming forward , defenders retreating before them , had no choice but to trample the living and the dead underfoot . Colonel David Channing , who had ranged from one end of the line to the other several times that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things up . If Pope had n't had enough of 01 Jack by now , he surely knew that at any minute Longstreet would come crashing down on his left flank.  |p344The  colonel watched Captain Thad Selby ride up and offer a creditable salute . But Channing was more gratified to see that Selby'snew uniform had been reduced by sweat , smoke , brambles , and dirt into proper Rebel attire . Channing took off his own droopy hat and wiped his forehead with his jacket sleeve , in lieu of a return salute . " Colonel , sir . . . Gin'al Jackson needs to know if Early'n Forno still in reserve behind Lawton ? " " Tell Gin'al Jackson they right where he put'em . An Selby .. . better tell'im of Jube 's so hot to fight he 's like to swaller'is chaw . " Selby hesitated , then asked : " They gone come again , Colonel ? " Channing shrugged . " Lots of daylight left . " " Looks like Longstreet could hit'em . " Selby 's tone was aggrieved . " Seem like our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way himself . To his knowledge , Longstreethad been in position at least since noon . All at time , Yanks givin us hell . And not so much as a one of Pete 's brigades movin over there . But such things could not be said to a junior officer . " Takes Longstreet awhile to git set , Cap'n . But when he hits , he hits like thunder . " Selby rode away , not appearing cheered . And the more Channing himself thought about Longstreet 's inactivity , the more annoyed he became . He thought bitterly of Jackson , badly as he had needed sleep , riding out the night before to put his ear to the ground , listening for help on the way . What the hell was the use in Longstreet being there , if he aimed to do nothing but sit still and rest up from the march ? Channing rode on along the line , noticing that the musket fire had slackened . Maybe , just maybe , Pope had decided he 'd had enough ; maybe just knowing Longstreet was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the Groveton  --  Sudley Springs Road , Channing checked the sun against his sense of time . Christ ! How the hours dragged . How much more could troops stand , if Pope came on again ? As if to emphasize the question , from straight ahead and nearby , a tremendous volley of musket fire  --  like an avenging crack of lightning  --  causedChanning 's horse to shy and rear , almost unseating him . But the colonel recovered quickly and spurred across the road . Damn bastard coming again , right over his own dead . As if he had n't already paid a big enough butcher 's bill . Scarcely fifty yards past the road , Channing saw ahead and to his left a blue battle line double-timing forward ; about two hundredp345yards behind , a second wave followed . At a glance he estimated two regiments in each line , with a fifth broken out into flanking companies . Hooker and Grover , learning from Nagel 's earlier effort , had chosenan excellent point of attack on Lawton 's front , where the low railway embankment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which Grover 's troops had formed and fixed bayonets . Grover ordered his men to dash down the slope without firing until the enemy musketry could be felt , then to charge rapidly on the embankment , firing one volley on command . When Channing reached the scene , Grover 's first wave already was swarming onto the embankment . The advantage of sloping ground ; the murderous effect of the one concerted blast of musketry ; the demoralizing sight of the advancing bayonets ; above all , the New Englanders ' relative freshness  --  for all those reasons , Grover 's men hit the tired butternuts harder than had any previous attackers . Fighting over the embankment with bayonets and clubbed muskets , the first Yank line pressed rapidly into Lawton 's rear , while the second , cheering , surged toward the embankment at the double-quick . My God , Channing thought . They 've broken us . Channing was stunned at the suddenness of the disaster , the change in the battle tide . Then he wheeled his horse and galloped for 01 Jack . Higher up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the wheel of a caisson , writing a note . The sight bewildered Selby . What could he be writing in the midst of chaos ? Smoke swirled around them and a shell burst nearby ; it scattered dirt and debris over Jackson and the bit of paper on his booted knee , reminding the young captain of the famous story about a Napoleonic general in much the same situation who said he had " needed no sand to dry his ink . " Jackson himself seemed to pay no attention to the shell burst . Selby saluted and delivered his report , listening nervously to the shriek of another shell coming in . The general thanked him just as the second shell burst , nearer than the first . Then Jackson went on writing . " Gin'al ... sir ! " Selby was profoundly impressed with his commander 's iron nerves ; he himself had had to muster a supreme effort not to throw himself to the ground when he had heard the rising whine of that shell on the way . And because he had not broken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been afraid . But Jackson , Selby thought , was taking intolerable chances . " This is a very hot spot , Gin'al ! "  |p346Jackson  looked up with what Selby thought was genuine puzzlement . " Why , Cap'n , I believe we 've been in hotter places before . " He was about to resume writing when the sound of a massive volley rang back from the line . Jackson stood up quickly , staring toward the sound . It was followed by a throaty cheer from hundreds of voices  --  a Union sound , Selby knew by then , nothing like the highpitched , coon-hunter 's yelping from Reb throats . Selby was transfixed , from fear of what might be happening and in fascination at the sight of the great Stonewall peering through the smoke , his whole body seeming to quiver with the effort to penetrate the fogs and distances of war . Selby had not realized how little even a commanding general , even one so renowned as 01 Jack , could know of the actual unfolding of a battle . No general could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one point , the situation there might be changed and some other place could demand his presence . What generals needed above all , Selby thought , were eyes that could penetrate smoke , forests , obscuring ground . Jackson signaled to an orderly to bring his horse and Selby mounted Jeff D. But just as Jackson swung himself into his saddle , a courier came galloping up the ridge . He shouted the news of the Yank attack before his wild-eyed horse had been slowed to a stop . Jackson seized Selby 's bicep in a powerful grip ; his pale blue eyes glittered under the forage cap . " Go to Gin'al Early ... " The voice was barely audible but the words were rapid , positive . " Tell him to reinforce Gin'al Lawton at once ! " Selby rode as hard as he could , the sounds of battle rising to a crescendo off to his right . He no longer tried to convince himself that he was unafraid ; he only forced himself to conceal his fear in selfcontrol . Dodging tree limbs and keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway , to think of anything but finding Early . But he knew from Jackson 's eyes and the force of his voice that he was carrying the most important message he ever had . Jeff D. covered the few hundred yards of rough , wooded ground in what seemed no more than seconds . But as Selby pulled to a halt beside General Jubal A. Early , he was surprised to see Forno 's Brigadealready double-timing in battle line toward the breach in front . Saluting , he rapidly delivered Jackson 's message . Early , who was renowned for his dyspeptic temperament , shifted a wad of tobacco from one bearded cheek to the other , then spat past Selby 's boot . His high voice easily penetrated the battle din : " He think I 'd just sitchere'n let'em stomp us under ? " Forno 's Louisianians , held in reserve all day , went in with " ap347hoop'n a holler " and a withering blast of lead . Their charge brought Grover 's attack to a halt , its second wave piling up behind the first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack been properly supported , Jackson 's army would have been cut in two . But once again Teddy Redmund could only shake his head and stamp his expensive English boot as the chance for a decisive blue move was squandered . With the rest of Company B , Thirteenth Georgia , Private AmbroseRiggin had been pressed back by the first Yank onslaught , but he had not panicked or run or thrown down his piece . He went back with his face to the blue attackers , loading and firing , loading and firing , as methodically as he had forced himself to do on the slope at Brawner 's farm the night before , thinking of nothing but loading and firing . As long as he could do that mechanically and ritually , he did not see the faces of the deserters every time he sighted along his hot barrel . Hill 's battered brigades rallied on the left , Lawton sent in a counterattack from the right , and Forno 's Louisianians pressed on . Between them , in twenty minutes of the hardest close-quarter fightingmost of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripped the New England regiments apart . Private Riggin , moving back toward the railway embankment in Lawton 's counterattack , kept on loading and firing , loading and firing , seeing nothing but smoke and the flash of muzzles and an occasionalrunning blue figure  --  until , stumbling over a body in his path , he emerged for a second from the haze of battle into air that seemed suddenly to have been washed clean . Only a few yards ahead , a Yank lieutenant waved a pistol and called after his retreating troops to stand and fight . No one listened , or perhaps even heard . Private Riggin leveled his piece at the lieutenant and began to squeeze the trigger . But before he could get off a shot , the officer looked behind him , his features contorted in disbelief and anger at the quick turn of fate . For a split second , for long enough , that agonized human face was in Private Riggin 's gunsight ; and he thought of the deserters . Then he saw his own face beyond the sight , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his arm and fired at him ; the slug from his pistol burned over Private Riggin 's head , so close that he felt a brazen twitch at his cap . Then the smoke closed down and the Yank officer was gone . Without support , their momentum broken , Grover 's men  --  those who could  --  pulled sullenly back across the embankment and into the woods . They went slowly and in good order and took their toll ofp348Rebs as they went ; Colonel Forno himself was hit by a sharpshooter and had to be carried from the field . But the damage the retreating Yanks inflicted was minor compared to the price they had paid . From the first volley to the final repair of the butternut front , Grover'sBrigade lost 41 dead , 327 wounded , and 118 missing or captured  --  486altogether , nearly a third of the 1,500 men who had swarmed down the open slope into 01 Jack 's line . It was then about 4 p.m . Four blue divisions in a long day of determinedattacks had failed to dislodge the butternuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had also been desultorily engaged on Jackson'sright . But all along Jackson 's left and center , exhausted men could scarcely lift their heads or sight a musket . Cartridge boxes were empty or nearly so . On Arnall 's front , men were piling up rocks against the next assault  --  which , with soldiers ' fatalism , they had no doubt was coming . Sam Stowe , the only one of Arnall 's regimental commanders alive and unwounded , gazed over the open field on the brigade 's left , beyond which thick lines of Yanks were barely held at bay by the guns on the heights above him . Only place they ai nt tried , Stowe thought . Thad Selby , glancing through the drifting smoke at the great red sun blazing and motionless , wondered if this day would ever end . It seemed to him that nearly all of his life had been passed in its smoke and flame and intolerable heat . He recalled then the old biblical story from his youth , how Joshua spake to the Lord on the way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon Gibeon and thou , Moon , in the valley of Ajalon . And the Lord harkened , so that in the midst of heaven the sun hasted not to go down until the children of Israel had destroyed the armies of the five kings . Surely 01 Jack was Joshua incarnate , mighty and merciless in the cause of an invincible God . But Selby was shocked to find himself longing faithlessly for Joshua 's sun to haste in its setting , to draw the shroud of night even over slaughter sent from heaven . Afternoon shadows were slanting across the yard at Sycamore when Amy Arnall came down the back stoop with the pistol in her hand . Some of the people had taken Pettigrew 's body away . Where it had lain , the grass showed a slight indentation , but in no recognizable shape . Army was relieved that there was no real reminder to upset Bess again.  |p349As  the long afternoon had dragged by , Amy had known , without really letting herself think about it , that sooner or later she would have to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason was gone . Somehow , she had not let herself worry about his coming into the house . Not even his crimes were likely to embolden him to that , she told herself . He knew she had the pistol , and he had every reason to be gone with Easter as soon as possible . Little Luke , awakening from his afternoon nap , had played peacefully in the nursery , apparently unaware of anything amiss even when Bess 's haunting cries had echoed through the old house . Incredibly , Judge Arnall had dozed on the verandah , in alcoholic torpor , throughout the commotion in the yard . " Lot of good he is , " Amy had complained to an uncomprehendingWillis , as he hovered over the Judge . That was unfair , she knew . What could a drunken old man do ? But it also seemed bitterly unfair that all the males in her life , even little Luke , were unable to help her when she needed them , when she had been trained to depend on male competence , courage , gallantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day , that the General 's seed was again growing within her . " Jedge , he gone be powful upsot . " Willis inclined his head knowingly , as if he had set her straight . " Yes . . . after it 's all over . " The biggest surprise to Amy had been the depth of Bess 's grief , which seemed little less than hysterical  --  so loud and prolonged that it had brought old Willis to the workroom with wringing hands and frightened eyes . Willis usually was good for little other than to dress and undress the Judge , but at least he had been able to go for a cloth and a basin of cool water . And he had given Amy the first suggestion of what had so affected Bess . " She 's usually so strong , Willis . I 've never seen her like this . " " He uz Bess 's man . " As he spoke , Willis was creeping off to the verandah to attend the Judge ; and despite her repeated calls , he neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deafness or the kind they could so easily feign , Amy could not be sure . Which he ? Hardly Jason . But Pettigrew ? Bess had suggested little interest in the curt driver  --  although Amy recalled that Bess had made an occasional cutting remark about " at skin'n bones wife-a hissen . " Reba , Amy had heard Bess mutter , " do n't even thow no shadduh . " But she had put such talk down to Bess 's general attitude of contempt for " em nigguhs . " And if Pettigrew really had been Bess 's " man , " why had n't he married her ? But Amy could think of no reason for Bess to take onp350so , except an intensely personal grief for Pettigrew . And only at the sight of her in unquenchable tears did Amy realize how much she had come to rely on Bess for good sense and emotional calm . At first she herself would resolutely not think about how Pettigrewhad died or what she 'd do without him . But she conceded that she 'd wronged him in suspecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bess 's grief also made clear that neither had she connivedto protect Jason ; otherwise , Amy thought , she 'd have been celebrating Jason 's escape . If he and Easter had left . But of course they had , as fast as they could get off the place . Amy held the cold cloth to Bess 's face and tried to comfort her . As soon as she 'd forced herself from the window and the dreadful pointing axe handle , she knew she had to notify the sheriff . But quieting Bess had been the more immediate task , and anyway she wanted to give Jason time to get away , as far away as possible . Becausewhen the sheriff caught him , there 'd be more violence ; and Sycamore had seen enough violence that day to haunt it forever . " Bess , Bess , " she murmured , rubbing the woman 's powerful wrists . " You 've got to help me , Bess . " She could face almost anythingif she could just get Bess back to her calm , competent self . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have known , but Amy realized that she knew none of the Africans well enough to trust them with such a mission . Maybe Bess , if she ever got herself under control . Not that they 'd all necessarily want to help Jason ; but all would be afraid of him , and of other bad niggers who might make them pay for tattling to the whites . " Bess ! Stop it now ! " Maybe Willis . Surely not even the worst African in the yard , not even Jason , would touch such an old man , one of their own . But Willis would never leave the Judge , and what would she do with the Judge if he did ? Neither the cool cloth nor kind words or rubbing Bess 's wrists seemed to calm the woman . Amy had smelling salts in her dressing room but she feared to leave Bess long enough to go for them ; in her hysteria , there was no telling what Bess might do . " Willis ! " The old man still did not answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the other servants had run from the house . It felt empty , deserted  --  a sense all the more chilling in contrast to the usual bustle about its hallways . " Bess . . . please ! " But Bess only wailed again . Half in an effort to shock her into calm , but half , too , in suddenly erupting exasperation , Amy slappedp351Bess , hard . She had never struck an African before , or anyone . She had been reared to consider it particularly bad form to hit a servant  --  notonly was it physical contact beneath her station ; it was an act of cruelty to the defenseless . For a moment Amy was aghast , even though she had acted partly to shake Bess from hysteria and could see that indeed the woman 's sobs had been momentarily silenced . But a part of her had not only wanted to hit Bess , punish one of them for this ordeal and for her own ineffectuality ; she had rather enjoyed the sting of it on her hand and the sense it gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bess . . . are you all right ? " But Bess was already beginning to wail again . In for a penny , in for a pound . Amy hit her harder , the second slap rocking Bess 's head to one side and echoing through the empty house like a firecracker . Not , Amy thought , at all like the deeper report of the pistol . No doubt this time that she 'd wanted to strike . Amy was ashamed but unrepentant . She felt her power . She rose from Bess 's side , went to the work table , and picked up the heavy gun . It made her think of the General . If he were here . . . but he is n't . No good to wish for what is n't . The sheriff had to be notified . The place had to be checked . To make sure Jason . . . but of course he was gone . Pettigrew . . . had to be seen to . No time for niceties . Behind her , Bess seemed quiet at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman staring at her wide-eyed , her strong fingers stroking her cheek where Amy had struck it . " I could n't get you to stop cryin any other way , Bess . " Bess nodded , tears streaming down her cheeks . Her eyes were fixed on the pistol , as if she had never seen such a thing before . But Amy suspected it really was she whom Bess was seeing for the first time  --  actually seeing . Well , a lot of people at Sycamore were seeing each other clear at last . Floorboards creaked in the front hall . Amy whirled but realized from the slow steps that Willis and the Judge were only shuffling toward the stairs . She concealed the pistol in her skirtfolds until she could hear them going up . Turning back to Bess , who was wiping her face on her apron , Amy put the pistol down and leaned back against the work table . " Willis says . he says Pettigrew 's your man " Was . Bess stared at her over the apron . " You never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " Bess 's voice was quiet , dull . " Nuffin to do . " " Why on earth did n't you marry ' im ? " Bess dropped her apron and shook her head . " I wa'nt his woman.  |p352An  now . . . " She did not have to finish the sentence . I never will be . " But no man 'd choose Reba over you . " Bess snuffled . " Ai nt choose nobody . Onlies reason he marry Reba , Easter wo n't have'im . " Amy remembered suddenly the day the sheriff came , how Pettigrewhad soothed Easter when she had been screaming and swearingher innocence of any knowledge of Jason . Pettigrew had been so ... loving , though Amy had not recognized it at the time , had not even connected such a word to the driver and the cook . " You mean Pettigrew loved Easter ? " Bess seemed limp as a rag doll as she sat against the wall beside the window . Her words were listless , her eyes dull . " Nobody else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in horrid detail , Amy saw again Pettigrew poised to leap on Jason 's back , saw him sprawled at Jason 's feet , Easter 's hands clutched around his ankles . Jason 's woman , Amy had thought then . Jason 's woman indeed . " An she kilt'im . " Bess 's low voice suddenly was venomous . " Nevuhno woman he care bout but her . An she kilt'im . " " She chose . " Amy was stunned at all she had not known , or even conceived , about the people in her yard . " One or the other , and she chose Jason . " What , she could not help but wonder , might she have done ? What would it be like to have two men in love with you ? She had never really known , she realized , any man but the General . It angeredher obscurely that such a remarkable thing should have come to an African , a whoring black .. . " Kilt'im ! " Bess seemed to be gathering strength from hatred of Easter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Slowly , in bits and piece , the story came out , Amy 's questions pulling some of it from Bess , the rest coming in a monotone so low that even in the quiet house Amy had to strain to hear . And as the afternoon her  --  that a life of rich complexity existed in the yard , a life of joy and sorrow , passion , expectation , dashed hopes , love fulfilled , love spurned , all inextricablyentwined in the workings of chance . Until she heard Bess 's story , Amy simply had not understood that the people in the yard were people . She had regarded them as servants , Africans , a different breed , and their life in the yard as having no more complicated humanity than the stereographic picturesthe General liked to collect . Bess , it seemed , long before Pettigrew became the General 's driver , had set out to win him  --  " Onlies man I 'd tetch wid a fishin pole "  --   |p353only  to run into the solid wall of his determination to get Easter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ba-a-d nigguh . Bound to be trouble .. . trouble . " But Easter , in the infinite perversity of love , wished for nothing but Jason 's embrace . Jason once a week  --  for an hour snatched from the kitchen  --  was all Easter wanted or thought about . Amy was embarrassed by Bess 's blunt judgment : " At slut got'er legs spread fore Jason cross de fence . " Reba , of course , understood the situation  --  " Ai nt a nigguh dis place ai nt knowed it . " Reba had been no more to Pettigrew , as Bess told it , than the completion of his driver 's role . That he should have a wife , family , someone to wash his clothes and cook his meals was merely necessary . " But not dis yere nigguh . Come round me wid at talk , I tole'im I eats de whole apple er none . " But Reba and his children had made no difference in Pettigrew 's dogged determination that Easter  --  " his Easter , " Bess called her , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself finally away on a ba-a-d nigguh . " But she done it . She would . " Bess had only one consolation . As the years had dragged along , Pettigrew often had had to turn to her for help with the problems of the yard , tacitly acknowledging that , wherever his affection lay , Bess had his respect . " Ceptin at ai nt done me no good nights when de bed uz cold . " Amy was uncomfortable again at the frankness of the words . But for all her ingrained reticence Amy understood the remark . The sense of being with someone , needing someone , being needed , was never so strong as in the warmth of bed . If only the General could leave it at that ! Then  --  Bess related  --  the news from Lakeview had come over the grapevine , implicating Jason long before the sheriff had come to Sycamore with official word . " How come Jason done it , Miss Tippy she let'er nigguhs run round at place like dey own it . But dis summer she tole'em at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so old . Jason he knowed at son . Knowed at meant whuppins'n hard work . So he gone take Easternrun off . But Miss Tippy , she kep money'n a bag unner her mattress . Dey all knowed it . So Jason gone grab at money fore he light out . " Amy clapped her hand over her mouth . She felt genuine horror at the idea of one of these lustful African men with their huge . . . one of them creeping into her bedroom at night . Even if just to steal.  |p354Her  newfound sense of humanity in the yard was not strong enough to overcome her revulsion . " Jason a ba-a-ad nigguh . " Bess 's tone of voice suggested that this explained much . " But I ai nt used-a think he really bad . I speck he ai nt meant nothin but grab at money . Den Miss Tippy , she woke up'n start in a-hollerin . Fore he knowed it , he shuttin'er up wid de pilluh . " Amy thought how she had slapped Bess to shut her up . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Den Jason so scairt , he try'n fix it so she look like she jes die'n'er sleep . " " But not scared enough to forget about the money ? " The memory of the axe handle pointing at the window from Pettigrew 's back was too stark for Amy to see anything redeeming in Jason 's deeds . " Nome . Soon 's dey burr Miss Tippy'n nobody speck nuffin , Jasonhe gone run off wid Easter like he plan . " Bess sighed heavily . " If some nigguh at Lakeview ai nt tell on'im , cuz he so scairt dey all git blame , Jason'n Easter be long gone . Instid . . . " Her voice trailed away . " But how did Jason get away ? When they found out ? " " He knowed dey gone put dawgs on'im . Conjur man he put gravedirton Jason 's feet . Ai nt no dawgs kin sniff a track thew grave-dirt . " Amy wanted to throw up her hands in bewilderment . Just as it had dawned on her that the Africans were human beings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here was the story of Jason 's bestial crime against a kindly old white woman ; here was Bess expressing the most ignorant superstition . As if grave-dirt or any other kind of voodoo could help Jason escape the hounds yelping in Sheriff Maxton 's pack ! But another implication in Bess 's story disturbed her more . " You knew all that ? When the sheriff was here ? " " Nome . Pe'grew tole me mostly jes today , after Jason come dis mornin . Cose some nigguh tole Pe'grew right off . " Pride was husky in her voice . " Em nigguhs tell Pe'grew evuhthing . But Pe'grew , he ai nt think-a nuffin cept Easter . At slut set on leavin wid'er man . " Now contempt made Bess shrill ; her hands clenched as if on Easter 's throat . " Some man . Smuvocatin at of lady nevuh raise'er hand at nobody . But Pe'grew knowed right off he got to find Jason , he aim to keep Easter fum runnin off wid'im . " But if Bess had known even part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , and all had failed to inform the sheriff . Much less Amy herself . Which showed not only how little you could trust them , but again how little whites really knew about the yard , about these people they liked to think were their charges.  |p355Amy  could hardly imagine the good-natured cook she had known for years  --  whose matchless Christmas fruit cakes were known throughout Duplin County  --  making such a desperate cast at fortune as to stand by a man like Jason . Of course African men were known to be rutting animals , but Amy found it hard to imagine any woman , black or white , who would stay with such a man for that kind of reason . Besides , Easter apparently could have had the superior Pettigrew . What kind of woman could she be , to have set two such different men so aflame with ... could it be called love ? ... that they had literally fought to the death for her ? " Why did n't Pettigrew or somebody tell me , Bess ? Or the sheriff ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nt know wher at nigguh hidin . Not twill he come dis mornin . " But that was merely the truth , not the reason , and they both knew it . If Bess or Pettigrew had known where to find Jason , neither would have told her . If Pettigrew had been fighting for his woman  --  not for the General 's house and family or for the law that subjugated him  --  perhaps he could hardly be blamed . And Bess at least had tried to ease Amy 's fears by moving into her room . It was n't her fault that Amy had only been alarmed the more . And why should Bess have helped the whites to catch and hang one of her own , even a criminal like Jason ? Even the boy at Lakeview who had informed on Jason had had to be frightened into it . Who , after all , could blame them for standing together in a world in which they were bound together ? But if that was the case , there could be no ultimate trust between master and slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted their lot were lies or self-delusions or both . " Sides , " Bess said , her voice suddenly ringing passionately in the room , " I want'im to git away . Take at slut wid'im . So my man nevuh lay eyes on'er agin . " Silence fell . Bess stared at Amy for a moment , defiantly , then looked into the space beyond Amy 's shoulder , opaque again , yielding herself no more . How different things were going to be from now on ! Amy knew she 'd never again be able to look at the people in the yard as so many shadows , having no substance . Or as passive recipients of their lot . And without Pettigrew . . . how could she possibly manage Sycamore without Pettigrew ? With the General at war ? They were silent for a long time , Bess on the floor against the wall , Amy leaning on the work table , before Amy remembered little Luke . The sheriff to be notified . Almost at once it came to her what to do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Luke . Getp356him dressed , please . I 'm going to have Ned hitch up the buggy . " If I can find him . If they have n't all run for the woods . " I 'll want you to go with us . " Bess had got up , looking a bit wobbly . " Go wher ? " " Why , to the sheriff , of course . " If she could be sure of no one else carrying the message , she 'd go herself , taking Luke and Bess . Willis would look after the Judge , get him some supper if he needed it . That was the only sure way to get the news to the sheriff . And if she took Luke and left , she would not have to make sure Jason had gone , although of course he had . The sheriff would do that . But Amy saw that Bess was hesitating . After all that had happened , could the woman still be reluctant to inform on Jason ? Amy was exasperated again . " Now Bess ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to report Pettigrew 's death . You could look after Luke for me while I drive . " Bess closed her eyes , her oaken-colored face impassive as the wall paneling . Amy tried to imagine the struggle behind that blank wall turned to a white world  --  the conflict between primitive tribal allegiance , reinforced by the common plight of bondage , and the ordinary human instinct to curb the outlaw and restore the order on which survival depends . In Bess 's case , too , the desire to see justice imposed on the murderer of her hopes . Bess opened her eyes . " Jason a mean nigguh , Mistis . I git de baby ready . " Amy listened to the stairs creak as Bess hurried up to Luke . Then she picked up the pistol , held it loosely by her side where her skirts mostly concealed it , and went into the hall . Only as she neared the back door did it seriously occur to her that Jason might be waiting outside . But of course he 'd be halfway out of Duplin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daylight . And as she came out on the stoop , forcing herself to look at the spot where Pettigrew had fallen , the yard was quiet , deserted . Nothing moved . No sound but late-day insect noises , bullbats and crickets . Amy had all she could do not to rush back into the house and bolt all doors and windows . Silly . She started across the grass toward the carriage house . If Ned had made himself scarce , she could hitch up herself . She could do what she had to do , show the General she could manage . But suppose Jason was waiting there , knowing that sooner or later she 'd . . . nonsense ! Jason and Easter were an hour , nearly two , on their way . Amy took a deep breath , her heavy breasts rising , and walked on . Still no sound but her own soft footfalls . Then , from the directionp357of the kitchen on her right , the corner of her eye caught a flicker of movement . Or did it ? Amy fought down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scream . She turned slowly toward the kitchen , the ivory pistol butt in her hand as solid and reassuring as the General 's broad shoulders would have been . She put her thumb on the hammer . " Mistis ! " The whisper , in the silence of the yard , was just loud enough to reach Amy 's ears . A girl 's sibilant whisper . Around the end of the privet hedge , for no more than a second , a dark face under a red kerchief peered out , then disappeared . Amy stood stock still , her knees so weak she could not take a step . Oh my God it 's Easter . Easter wants me to get her away . But surely the face had been too thin , too dark to be Easter 's . With an effort of will almost as great as that with which she had pointed the pistol at Jason , Amy forced one step after another , across the grass , over the very spot where . . . she fancied she could smell bate and lye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Amy almost cried with relief to see Penny 's childish face behind the hedge . Then the words sunk in . Ai nt gone . She felt them like blows from the axe . I ca n't ca n't face ca n't do do n't know . But as it had before , her training as a lady , her place as mistress of Sycamore , saved her from abjection . She had to control herself in the presence of a servant ; that was the most inflexible , the most tyrannical of the rules by which she lived . But she could do little more than stammer . " N . . . not gone ? " " At Easter 's house . His arm broke . " Amy remembered Pettigrew smashing the stove wood against Jason 's arm and shoulder as Jason ducked . Oh , bad luck ! Rotten luck ! Else he 'd be gone . She realized that , all along , she 'd known somehow that Jason was still there . Still to be dealt with . " Mistis ... " Why , Amy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reba say tell you . . . " The whisper squeaked and stopped . Amy saw by Penny 's wide child 's eyes that she was in terror . Making two of us . " Go on , P . . . Penny . " " Reba say Jason got nigguhs watchinat ca'ige house . Drive , too . Say you start to leave dis place , Jason gone . . . Jason ... " Penny choked , stopped , peered at Amy with wide and unblinking eyes . " All right . " The frantic energy of fear made it easy , this time , to cock the stiff hammer with one thumh . " I understand . "  |p358Amy  turned toward the house , then stopped , not looking back , the discipline of a lifetime surpassing even fear . " Please thank Reba , Penny . Please say I 'm sorry about Pettigrew . " She was amazed , as she went across the grass toward the house , at her clarity of mind and self-control , as if the dark fruition of what once had seemed only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cope with malignant reality . Her legs and hands were steady , and she was beginning to think what to do as calmly , it seemed to her , as she might once have planned a dinner  --  perhaps because she was assuring herself that Jason could n't hurt anybody much with only one arm . She was looking sharply , too , for the niggers on watch . Fix them when I find out who they are . Just before she went up the stoop , Amy measured the sun against the horizon . If only it could stand still , like Joshua 's in the Bible ! If only she need not face the night as well as Jason . General A. P. Hill , like Sam Stowe , believed the Yanks had had enough of attacking him from the woods . The railway cuts and banks made his front hard to break , and the brigades Jackson had distributedalong his compact line could be shifted to shore up any threatenedpoint . If they came again , Hill reasoned , they 'd come over the open field on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . That was worrisome . Hoke Arnall 's troops had been in the thick of it all day . God knew how many casualties there had been . Not an experienced officer was left save Colonel Stowe . All of Hill 's brigades had been too constantly engaged to be pulled out and sent to the ammunition wagons ; and runners had not been able to keep them properly supplied . Hill 's reserves were just about used up , too ; most were in the line already . He had none with which to relieve Arnall . Still . . . a move had to be made . Hill sent a courier urgently to find Hoke Arnall . The courier located the General , his pistol strapped to his waist in the famous Mexican holster , standing with Colonel Stowe at the rail fence . The firing had lagged from its earlier pitch , but muskets were still popping from the woods . Arnall 's line was mostly holding its fire to save bullets . " Gin'al Arnall , sir ! " They exchanged salutes . " Gin'al Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off an attack on your left ? " Arnall had no doubt of the answer . But in the style of Lee 's army he deferred to the officer who would have the most direct responsibility.  | " Sam . . . what about it ? " Stowe removed his trampled straw hat , smeared the sweat on his forehead with a dirty sleeve , and glared at the motionless sun . " Dark 'd be the best thing , Gin'al . But if they come , I reck'n we 'll make it hot for'em . " Arnall had always insisted to his officers that he wanted no romantic nonsense when they gauged the truths of battle . He needed hard facts , considered opinion ; so , of course , did Hill . If , however elliptically , Stowe said the position could be held , Stowe believed it . Still , he would have wished more fire in Stowe 's answer , to suggest more in his belly . " Course I 'm countin on the guns givin'em a goddam fit . " Arnall winced at Stowe 's casual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time , I hope Gin'al Hill got some reserves in hand . " Arnall reckoned Hill had no real reserves , that late in the day . He or Jackson could strengthen the left only by weakening the line somewhere else . But he was faintly annoyed that Stowe should be thinking such thoughts . The Yanks had n't , in fact , managed a coordinatedattack all day . Every time they 'd threatened , somehow the boys had held . And they 'd do it again . They 'd outfight'em . Had n't they done it all day ? That was just the fact of it , not wishful thinking . Arnall felt a fierce surge of confidence in his troops , his position , his God , himself . He nodded thanks to Stowe and turned to the courier . " Tell Gin'al Hill I think we can hold . Tell'im my ammunition 's about gone but we still got the bayonet . " A bayonet , of course , was worth nothing like a full cartridge box . But the bayonet could scare the wits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arnall thought most Yanks were n't , and it was deadly in hand-to-hand fighting . Watching the courier hasten off to Hill , Hoke Arnall found himself almost eagerly looking forward to that  --  anotherclose-quarter fight , no holds barred . " We got rocks , too . " Stowe put his hat back on . " Me , I 'd still rather have at sun go down . " Teddy Redmund , even though he knew nothing of Longstreet 's arrival , had nevertheless concluded that the blues would not attack Jackson again . In his professional opinion , they 'd strewn enough bodies through the woods and on the edge of the railroad cut  --  and not a few in it  --  to learn their lesson . Of course , they should have turned the position ; anybody could see that . As he mounted his horse in some irritation at Pope 's ineptitude , Redmund saw no reason to suppose the blues would try a turningp360attack now , since the butternut artillery alone had held them off all afternoon . These Americans did n't have much stomach for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them feel like the squirrel and pigeon hunters most of them were . With his havelock streaming behind him , Redmund rode slowly back toward the center of Jackson 's line , wondering if at the end of the day 's shooting  --  desultory and sullen now , as if both armies were played out but neither wanted to be first to quit  --  he might be able to approach Jackson . The man was said to be mad as a hatter , no way to predict what he 'd do . Redmund was burning to know  --  and Sertorius would have to explain  --  why the butternut " genius " had precipitated this unnecessarybattle against superior forces that was consuming his army piece by piece . Assuming there was a reason . As Redmund rode along the lower levels of Sudley Mountain , General Hill and several of his entourage passed nearby , also riding toward the center . Redmund followed , at first discreetly , then closer , since no one in the group seemed to be noticing him . Hill 's party rode over a knoll and into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw from the opposite side and Hill threw up his hand for a halt . He saluted the first of the two men  --  the ungainly rider with a long brown beard and a forage cap pulled low on his forehead that Redmund , the evening before , had surmised was the legendary Stonewall . Not much of a legend to look at . But Redmund wondered if this might not prove to be his best chance to approach Jackson . He edged his horse nearer , hoping to suggest that he was one of Hill 's staff party. " ... attacked again , of course my division will do its best . But we 're so weakened , ammunition and men , that I ca n't be sure of success . " Redmund could just barely make out Jackson 's answer . " General Hill , your men have done nobly . If you 're attacked again , you will beat the enemy back . " The Englishman was amazed at Stonewall 's calm . Except for a slight emphasis on the word " will , " he had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report . But just as he finished speaking , the butternut batteries behind the left boomed , as if in unison . Hill swung his horse sharply to the sound ; its echoes had hardly died away before the guns were firing individually , as fast  --  Redmundjudged  --  as they could be served . " Here it comes ! " Hill did not even bother to salute , as he spurred back toward his command . This time Jackson 's voice rang through the roar of the guns : " I 'll expect you to beat them ! "  |p361Redmund  sensed in those few shouted words a powerful intensity  --  not " Good luck ! " or empty exhortation but a flat statement leaving no room for failure or excuse . Hill would " beat them " becauseJackson would accept nothing less . Redmund was about to swing his horse to follow Hill 's galloping party when from under the forage cap pale eyes flashed and Jackson'slong arm suddenly pointed at him . In a voice that was no longer clear or ringing , he seemed to be saying something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket and a worse-looking slouch hat . Quickly the colonel moved up beside Redmund , seized his horse 's halter strap , and bared yellowing teeth in what no doubt he considered a grin . Foul tobacco breath made Redmund pull his head back in distaste . " Who might you be , Mister ? " In the thunder of the guns , the question was not so much audible as deduced from the colonel 's moving lips . Feeling it hopeless to explain , Redmund began to fish in his pockets for his papers . He saw , beyond the colonel , Jackson turn his horse 's head and trot from the draw . Redmund 's searching fingers found the wallet in which he stored his bona fides ; but just then the colonel , still grinning , put his whiskeredface unpleasantly close and shouted : " Ol Jack thinks you a spy , Mister ! So you must be a spy ! " Hill 's instinct had been sound . As Hoke Arnall and Sam Stowe gazed over the rail fence , they saw blue ranks unmistakably forming battle lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher on the ridge saw them , too , and opened up immediately . But this time , despite the heavy cannonading into the woods and the fiery barrier of shell bursts across the ground before them , a brigade of Yanks moved out boldly and in well-spaced waves toward the rail fence . At 5:30 p.m . General Philip Kearny had received orders from Pope to attack on the far left flank of the Rebel line . Kearny , who wore his empty uniform sleeve pinned across his chest , was known as a fighting terrier of a general . But even he had been reluctant throughout the long afternoon to attack on his own discretion into heavy artillery fire from Sudley Mountain  --  an advantageous artilleryposition from which massed Federal batteries had been unable to drive the Rebel guns . Kearny had no choice but to obey Pope 's order . He sent forward General John C. Robinson 's Brigade of Pennsylvania and Indiana veterans , who promptly emerged from the woods and moved in good order over the open field toward the rail knee . Shellfire opened gaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Yanks '  |p362a|p|pearance  that the shelling was not going to stop them , shifted as many men as he could from the railway cut to the fence . Hours before , he had given up the effort to maintain a brigade reserve ; having lost , by his best estimate , more than a third of his men in ten hours ' fighting , he had all he could do to defend his perimeter . Sparks and Dixon were wounded and out of it , McCrary was dead , and Arnall had no proper regimental structure , save for Stowe 's South Carolinians . What he had instead was a clutch of skeleton companies , some with no more than sergeants in charge , and all with virtually empty cartridge boxes . They would n't average three rounds a musket . The General stared across the fence , through the drifting smoke , at the oncoming Federals , fresh troops with plenty of ammunition , bent low now , as if against a strong wind , but moving inexorably forward . Come on , Arnall thought . Something in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comin . Stowe touched his arm and put his lips to Arnall 's ear : " Hoke ... whatever happens . . . we gave'em a hell of a fight ! " As if from a great distance , Arnall looked at the colonel in his crushed , ridiculous hat ; he felt his lips draw back from his teeth . A hell of a fight ? Whatever happened ? The tone of resignation was unmistakable . He sensed himself at that moment , in that world  --  and what other mattered ?  --  the better man , unshaken , indomitable . " Whip'em ! " The words snarled from his throat , through his clenched jaw , up from the depths of a warrior 's spirit . " Whip the bastards , Stowe . . . whip'em ! " Skirmishers ' bullets began to whine over the fence in multiplyingnumbers wheat-wheat-wheat ! Arnall 's brain began clinically to record events before him  --  a blue body thrown backward by shell percussion , a color bearer going down , another Yank seizing the standard before it hit the ground , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along like a massive auger just beneath the earth 's surface . By then , battle was a terrible familiarity . And Hoke Arnall wasa different man from the one who had ceremoniously and conspicuouslypulled on , so many bloody hours before , the Mexican holster . Then he had been concerned mostly to seize upon his crucial position to make the reputation he coveted , wipe the stain of his arrestfrom Jackson 's consciousness . He had wanted mostly to win approval . But as the sun had inched in its interminable wheel across thesky , as he had watched his tattered ranks thinning like a cornfieldbefore foragers , as the Yank waves had beat against his position  --  his ground  --  and fallen back whipped , outfought every time , Hokep363Arnall had discovered the terrible freedom , the redeeming joy of violence . When the Yanks had got into the cut between his position and Thomas 's , Arnall felt himself aflame with rage  --  his ground trespassed !  --  butmore than that . He had flung himself into the new round of man-to-man fighting with the same ferocity unleashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arnall was convinced , by then , that the power of a vengeful God had strengthenedhis muscles . He had been rewarded at last for the fidelity of his belief and made terrible by His power . Arnall 's pistol had become not just something to wear in a showy holster but an extension of God 's merciless strength . When his cartridgeswere gone  --  young fool Folsom failing to reach him in time with more  --  he had used the heavy metal like a club , smashing it repeatedly into Yank faces , over Yank heads , wrists , necks . His saber rose and fell with Jove-like force ; once he severed a blue arm as cleanly at the bicep as if with a surgical saw . Again he seemed immune to danger  --  God 's shadow his shield  --  though he had saber cuts on both hands , powder burns on his neck and face , the track of a grazing bullet burning on his thigh , a massive lump on the side of his head from a Yank musket butt swung not quite hard enough . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arnall never doubted that God had guided his life to this moment , this ground to be held , beneath the unforgiving sun . His judgmentwould have to be faced if Arnall 's ground should be lost . But Arnall did not aim to lose . Generals were not supposed to be in ranks , fighting hand to hand , clubbing their pistols , but God had His purposes , not to be questioned . Arnall 's men had held the ground because God had sent His instrument to show them God 's power . Late in the day Arnall had even stacked up rocks with one of Dixon 's bled-out companies , side by side with a barrel-chested privatehe did not recognize as one of those he had routed the day before from a fenced yard in Centreville . To Arnall , a warrior in the grip of God 's awful passion , the men had become nameless , faceless , all as one , in the simple necessity to outfight the Yanks and hold the ground . Life had narrowed to a single proposition . Whip'em . Whip the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win . He heard Stowe shouting , saw the men at the fence leveling their muskets , new ranks of blue invaders coming on , steadily , confidently , the range closing , smoke and dust hazing over the savage beauty of life and death at the uttermost , at the edge of human capacity , where only God 's will determined . He screamed his affirmation  --  defiance , faith , victory  --  into the crash of Stowe 's muskets.
