In ' 82 , unions may be talking more about givebacks than pay increases <P> For millions of American workers , 1982 will be a year of anxious waiting . With unemployment reaching toward 9% , and perhaps higher , and an economy starting the year in a steep decline , employees will be worrying about job security and the prospect of very modest pay increases . <P> Major labor negotiations are due to take place during the year . The auto and rubber workers and the teamsters are all bargaining for new contracts . Although such groups represent only a small fraction of the total American labor force , they traditionally have set the wage pattern for the rest of unionized employees and even influenced wage settlements for many nonunion workers . <P> But the atmosphere is far different from three years ago , when those unions last bargained . At that time the auto workers won an agreement that has pushed their pay up 15% in each of the last two years and the rubber workers got a contract that will be worth about 50% over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rear-guard action to avoid giving up gains made in past negotiations rather than bargaining for important new pay hikes . <P> In a move indicative of the tough times facing organized labor , the United Auto Workers union last week agreed to consider reopening existing three-year labor contracts with General Motors and Ford . This may lead to some benefit reductions . " The depression in the auto industry has gone from bad to worse , " said Donald Ephlin , director of the union 's Ford department . " I want to discuss the disastrous shape Ford is in , and what can be done to protect the jobs of the workers . " <P> For the first time in more than three decades , management this year almost totally dominates wage negotiations . Companies in the past were often ready to give in to worker demands in order to keep their plants operating . But now with union leaders more concerned with job security for their members , talk of long strikes or costly wage settlements has virtually disappeared . Admits AFL-CIO Economist John Zalusky : " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Nowhere are labor 's troubles more evident than in Detroit . As the U.S. auto industry this week limps to the end of its worst sales year since 1961 , 345,000 members of the U.A.W. are on temporary or indefinite layoff . Moreover , the union 's active membership has shrunk by 300,000 workers since 1979 , to 1.2 million . Chrysler has been on the intensive-care list for more than two years , and union officials are now worried about the survival of American Motors . Admits U.A.W. President Douglas Fraser : " The industry and , consequently , the workers are in deep , deep trouble . "
