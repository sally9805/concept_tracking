The five astronauts who will fly the space shuttle Challenger arrived here this morning for final briefings before the flight . Officials of the Kennedy Space Center said preparations were proceeding smoothly toward a scheduled liftoff Tuesday at 2 : 15 A.M. , New York time. // Commanding the planned six-day mission , the eighth in the shuttle program and third for the Challenger , will be Capt . Richard H. Truly of the Navy , who was a pilot on the second test flight of the Columbia in 1981 . The other crew members will be going into space for the first time . They are Comdr . Daniel C. Brandenstein of the Navy , Lieut . Comdr . Dale A. Gardner of the Navy , Lieut . Col. Guion S. Bluford Jr. of the Air Force and Dr. William E. Thornton , a physician. // For one of them , Colonel Bluford , it will be more than just one man ' s first space journey . He will be the first American black to travel in space . Beyond his duties , which include deploying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Bluford will be performing a symbolic role much as Dr. Sally K. Ride , the first American woman in space , did on the previous flight in June. // With these two missions in the third decade of space flight , the all-male , all- white image of the American space program is beginning to fade into history. // Colonel Bluford , a quiet 40-year-old Air Force officer from Philadelphia who holds a doctorate in aerospace engineering , insists that his overriding desire is simply to fly in space and that he feels no unusual pressure because he is black . But he is not unmindful of his historic role. // As he said recently , " I recognize the fact that I ' m the guy who ' s setting the pace for the people who are going to fly behind me , but I don ' t feel as if I have to be perfect as well. " // The 78-member astronaut corps includes three other blacks : Lieut . Col. Frederick P. Gregory of the Air Force , Maj. Charles F. Bolden of the Marine Corps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is assigned to a shuttle flight next year. // The blacks joined the corps , along with eight women , when it was expanded in 1978 and 1980 in preparation for the shuttle era . Colonel Bluford will not be the first black in space . That distinction belongs to a Cuban of black heritage , Arnaldo Tamayo Mendez , who flew on a Soviet mission in 1980. // Asked by reporters if he felt his flight fulfilled the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ' s pledge to erase its white-dominated image , Colonel Bluford said : " I wouldn ' t say they have completely attained that , but I think they ' re working hard in that direction . You must remember that blacks have been held up an awful long time , and they ' re trying to catch up in earning all the opportunities that are out there . It takes time to do that. " // He further noted , in a news conference at the Johnson Space Center in Houston last month , that in the early years the requirements to be an astronaut included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Opportunities // " Really , there are just very few blacks that are in that particular profession , " said Colonel Bluford , who is not a test pilot but did fly 141 combat missions in Vietnam . " It ' s only been since the development of the shuttle , where you don ' t have to be a pilot or a test pilot in order to become an astronaut , that the field has opened up considerably to other people who want to fly in space . That has opened up more opportunities for women as well as minorities in the program . And also since the last 20 years , we have more blacks in the test-piloting business , so we have a larger pool to choose from. " // Lieut . Gen. James A. Abrahamson , NASA ' s associate administrator in charge of the shuttle program , recalled in an interview Friday that , but for a tragedy , a black astronaut probably would have flown in space earlier. // In the mid-1960 ' s , the general said , Maj. Robert Lawrence was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force ' s Manned Orbiting Laboratory program . When the program was canceled in 1969 , many of the astronauts transferred to NASA and have since made it into space . Major Lawrence was a " superb guy and would surely have flown by now , " General Abrahamson said . He was killed in a plane crash long before he had his chance . His widow will be among NASA ' s guests watching the Challenger blast off with Colonel Bluford aboard. // Also on hand will be several dozen of the black Tuskegee Airmen from World War II , witnesses to a past when the armed services were as segregated as American society in general was , and the only way blacks could fly was in a segregated squadron . They were trained at a segregated base at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama and , as members of the all-black 99th Fighter Squadron and the 332nd Fighter Group , they distinguished themselves in combat over North Africa , Sicily and Italy. // The first black American aviator , according to the Encyclopedia of Black America , was Eugene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Death . " But to enter aviation he had to go to France and join the Foreign Legion . He gained fame in World War I as a member of the legendary Lafayette Escadrille , the group of American volunteer aviators in the French air service , and did not return to the United States until 1940 . <> <> Launching of Satellite // Captain Truly said Colonel Bluford would be " primarily responsible on board for the correct and safe launch of the Insat satellite " and for assisting the two pilots in the ascent and landing phases of the flight . At those times , Colonel Bluford will occupy a seat just behind the pilots , the same seat occupied by Dr. Ride on the Challenger ' s most recent journey. // Insat-1B , a combination telecommunications and meteorology satellite , is to be deployed from the Challenger ' s cargo bay in the same manner as other commercial satellites on previous space shuttle missions . Early Wednesday morning , about 45 minutes after its release from the cargo bay and after the shuttle has moved away a safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to propel the satellite toward its desired position 22 , 300 miles over the Equator. // At that position , over the Indian Ocean , the satellite is to provide telephone , television and other forms of telecommunications throughout India . Two especially powerful channels will be capable of relaying television transmissions to small dish antennas set up in remote Indian villages. // The satellite was built by Ford Aerospace and Communications Corporation in a joint venture with India ' s Department of Space . India is paying NASA $12 million to deliver its satellite to orbit. // The Challenger will be traveling light this time because what would have been its largest payload , the space agency ' s second Tracking and Data Relay Satellite , was grounded . Engineers wanted more time to solve the rocket malfunction that left the first relay satellite in the wrong orbit last April . <> <> Tests With Relay Satellite // By early July , after a long sequence of thruster-firing maneuvers , the $100- million relay satellite was finally placed in its proper orbit 22 , 300 miles over Brazil . Communications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relay satellite as a link , will be conducted throughout this mission. // Harold Draughon , the chief flight director at the Johnson Space Center , said the astronauts would not be involved in most of these tests . But he said they would be asked on several occasions to check the onboard communication systems and maneuver the shuttle to break the link intentionally between the shuttle ' s antenna and the satellite . This would serve to test the shuttle ' s ability to re-acquire the link automatically . Eventually most communications with shuttles and other spacecraft will be handled through a network of such relay satellites . To fill up some of the area in the cargo bay that had been set aside for the second relay satellite , mission officials added a 7 , 460-pound dummy spacecraft shaped like a dumbbell . The object will be grappled and lifted as a further test of the shuttle ' s 50-foot-long robotic arm , which will be operated primarily by Commander Gardner . The structure will not be deployed outside the cargo bay. // A diverse mix of other cargoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containers carrying 260 , 000 philatelic covers to be sold for $15. 35 each by the Postal Service . A machine for processing medicines in weightlessness will be making another trip , this time equipped to separate live animal cells in an experiment that might lead to transplants of insulin-producing cells for diabetics. <> <> 6 Rats in Cage // Six rats will also be on board , riding in a cage designed for future animal experiments in space . The space agency said it wanted to demonstrate that the new cage would house the rats " without compromising the health and comfort of either the astronaut crew or the rats. " // The Challenger ' s nighttime launching will be the first for a shuttle , but not the first for American astronauts . The last mission to the Moon , Apollo 17 , took off in darkness in December 1972 . The timing of the Challenger ' s liftoff was dictated by requirements to deliver the Insat satellite to the proper orbit at the right time. // //            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
