MONTREAL  --  A bitter dispute has erupted among members of Montreal ' s Steinberg family , which controls Steinberg Inc. , one of Canada ' s largest retail concerns . The dispute has ended up in court and may result in the sale of the company . The company termed the dispute " a private family affair . " But it confirmed that interest has been expressed in acquiring the company and that an informal takeover bid was made in August and rejected by a majority of the family members . According to court documents filed by some family members , the takeover bid was valued at more than one billion Canadian dollars ( $777 million ) . The bidder wasn ' t disclosed . Steinberg operates supermarket chains in Quebec , Ontario and Arizona , and has extensive interests in real estate , sugar refining and restaurants . In the year ended July 25 , Steinberg earned 66. 9 million dollars , or 2. 87 dollars a share , including a tax credit of 8. 5 million dollars , on revenue of 4. 49 billion dollars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mitzi Steinberg Dobrin , a Steinberg director , and her husband , Melvyn Dobrin , Steinberg ' s chairman . The suit , filed in Quebec Superior Court , seeks to remove Mrs. Dobrin ' s sisters , Marilyn Steinberg Cobrin and Evelyn Steinberg Alexander and their respective husbands as trustees of two of four Steinberg family trusts . Mrs. Dobrin , Mrs. Cobrin and Mrs. Alexander are daughters of Samuel Steinberg , the company ' s founder , who died in 1978 . The four trusts jointly control 2. 4 million common voting shares of Steinberg , which represent a 40% voting interest in the company . The company has a total of 23 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis , but the 17 million publicly traded Class A shares don ' t carry any votes . The voting shares are closely held , mostly by family members , and aren ' t traded publicly . In their suit , the Dobrins accuse the Cobrins and the Alexanders of ignoring the interests of the trusts and their beneficiaries , and of disregarding " serious and substantial offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also accuse the Cobrins and the Alexanders of attempting to oust Mr. and Mrs. Dobrin from the Steinberg board and to replace them with Mrs. Cobrin and Mrs. Alexander . Mrs. Cobrin and Mrs. Alexander aren ' t active in the company ' s management . The suit gives details of meetings between family members that deteriorated into screaming matches and insults , and states that since a particularly nasty confrontation in the summer of 1986 , Mrs. Cobrin hasn ' t spoken with her mother , Helen Steinberg , who was removed last summer as trustee of a voting trust agreement covering the shares . Mr. Cobrin said the attorney for his wife and Mrs. Alexander would comment on the allegations today . Mortimer Freiheit , attorney for Mr. and Mrs. Dobrin , said he hopes the dispute can be settled amicably . A date hasn ' t been scheduled for a court hearing on the suit . Irving Ludmer , Steinberg ' s president and chief executive officer , said in a statement that he didn ' t believe the dispute would " affect the management and operation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that inquiries " are being made " of some shareholders " to determine their interest in proposals to acquire all of the equity shares of the corporation . " According to the suit filed by the Dobrins , Mr. Ludmer told family members last August that one of the benefits of selling the family ' s shares was that this " would effectively resolve the ongoing family dispute . " The suit says the offer approximated 50 dollars a share . Steinberg Class A shares were halted at the opening of trading Friday , pending news . They closed Thursday on the Montreal Exchange at 31. 50 dollars , up 3. 25 dollars . Martin Kaufman , a Montreal-based analyst with Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Ltd. , said that once the family settles its dispute , " it will pave the way for somebody to make an offer for all of the shares . " He said the company ' s high-quality assets , both in retailing and real estate , would make it an attractive target for a Canadian or U.S. acquirer . He also said that Mr. Ludmer , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1984 , had succeeded in overcoming problems that plagued it in the early 1980s .
