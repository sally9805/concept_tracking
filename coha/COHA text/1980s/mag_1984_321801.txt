All presidential elections are extraordinary in their fashion , as have been TIME 'S efforts to cover them over the past 60 years . But no special election edition of the magazine has approached the dimensions of this week 's issue . It contains 45 pages of election stories , almost twice as many as any such issue in the past . It offers an unprecedented 59 pages of color . It is one of the largest issues TIME has ever published , and it is a record advertising issue . <P> As has become traditional for our presidential election coverage , TIME went to press four days earlier than usual , and will keep its special issue on the newsstand for eleven days . Its crash-close deadlines called for the presses to start only 15 hours after the last polls closed . <P> All across the country , TIME 'S bureau chiefs deployed their forces to cover not only the contest for President but also the significant congressional and state races . Correspondents in all of the key cities and state capitals conducted exit polls and monitored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From those hour-by-hour reports , supplemented by insights from expert political observers and party leaders , the bureau chiefs described how Americans in their part of the country voted-and why they voted overwhelmingly for Ronald Reagan . <P> TIME correspondents accompanied each of the four major candidates as they gave their last speeches and shook their last few hundred hands . Two White House correspondents covered Ronald Reagan 's final forays : Douglas Brew traveled with the President on a five-day , 16-city swing , and Laurence Barrett was there for the huge G.O.P. wrap-up rally in San Diego . <P> Time Inc . Editor in Chief Henry Grunwald , TIME Managing Editor Ray Cave and Barrett met with Reagan last week in the Oval Office for an exclusive interview , and Barrett and Brew interviewed the President again on Election Day , when he knew his victory was assured ( see page 52 ) . On the road with Mondale were Correspondents Sam Allis and Jack White . Said Allis of the frantic finish : " Mondale 's pace since the debates has been brutal . We arrive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the schedule at the last minute . Sometimes I feel as if I have been on Guadalcanal for a year . " <P> Los Angeles Correspondent Melissa Ludtke followed a confident Vice President George Bush on his eight-day trip through eleven states . Washington Correspondent David Beckwith observed the last stops of Geraldine Ferraro 's precedent-setting campaign . " Her traveling entourage was upbeat and lighthearted to the end , " he reported . " It was one of those occasions in the life of a journalist when you are very aware of watching history being made . " <P> To write , edit and check the 19 election stories in Nation , TIME augmented the regular staff of that department with editors , writers , reporter-researchers , artists , copyreaders and other specialists from all sections of the magazine . The picture department assigned 15 photographers from coast to coast , with the latest election-night photographs from the West Coast being beamed by satellite to New York City for editing and transmission to printing plants . <P> One very special writing assignment was that undertaken by Theodore H. White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His role : a major story for TIME examining the new forces at play in the American political arena .
