Culture Club stirs up shock waves with some smooth tunes <P> Hold on , take it easy . The sex stuff is coming up in a minute . First , listen to the music . <P> Culture Club is the hottest band of the moment from England or , very likely , from anywhere else . The group 's success is almost as wild as the opera poof masquerades of its lead singer , Boy George . Consider : three Top Ten singles from Culture Club 's first album , Kissing to Be Clever , which sold more than a million copies ; a fourth , fresh single , Church of the Poison Mind , already snug at No. 11 , with another , Karma Chameleon , ready to take off ; and a new album , Colour by Numbers , storming the LP charts . <P> Culture Club whips up a smooth , seamless sound that proudly picks every pocket of pop for inspiration : reggae , soul , country and western , mainstream rock . The results are whimsical , joyous and occasionally mysterious detonations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to borrow a favorite word of the lead singer 's , never naf . " Naf ' stands for out of it , rotten , done over and overdone-and not , clearly , for Culture Club , which seems , at this somewhat disjointed juncture on the hit parade , to define the very core of contemporary pop . <P> Part of the soul of this success , a good deal of the inspiration and most of the attention have been laid at the swinging door of Boy George . Says Percussionist Jon Moss , at 26 the band 's elder statesman : " Boy George is our anchor . You 're never going to be able to spot a Culture Club record by just the music . It will be George 's voice that identifies us . " The voice is an excellent instrument , gliding over notes like a Slinky toy that springs downstairs on its own power . As the saloon singers of an older generation might have put it , the kid 's got a great set of pipes . <P> He is , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the hoofs , a lot like the flyboy who would n't grow up and , yes , apparently pansexual too . This last aspect of Culture Club has caused many titters , generated a lot of speculation and produced countless photos of Boy George , resplendent and unrepentant , winking or moue-ing in four-color splendor . His wardrobe is a tip-to-toe tutorial in the applied art of sartorial shock : coats that Scaramouche might have worn had Scaramouche been a color-blind butcher , a rabbi 's black felt hat and unorthodox ties that seem to glow radioactively . His makeup is heavy : mascara ( more under the eye than over ) , raspberry-colored lips , lots of foundation and cantilevered eyebrows . " I try to make my eyes look like Elizabeth Taylor 's , " he says . " And really , I have one picture of myself that looks so much like her . " <P> The paradox is intriguing : the soulful voice and the drop-dead campiness . It also invites a few questions , which Boy George , 22 , can handle expertly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm as gay as I am heterosexual . O.K. , I 've experimented with both sexes , but I 'm not a limp-wristed floozy and I 'm not a transvestite . Transvestites show tits , man . I 'm 6 ft. , I 'm a man , and I have no delusions . " As for his appearance , Boy also says that he has " experimented " a good deal but " I 'm just convinced that this is the way I look best . "
