Last night ' s 7-4 St. Louis was the first time the Blues have won here since March 1 , 1973 , and it was their third triumph on Garden ice since the NHL expansion team was founded in 1967 . " It was a great moral victory for us , " said coach Red Berenson , " because we haven ' t won here for so long . It showed our kids that it could be done . " There are three things you have to do to win here . You have to check . You have to make the most of your chances and you have to have superb goaltending . We had all three for part of the game but we went out of our game for the second and third periods . " We weren ' t checking the way we should have checked , but our goaltending saved us . Mike Liut was amazing , " added Berenson . " He has been playing very well for us . But he never before has had to stand on his head to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and place . And he stayed in there . That was his best . " Brian Maxwell and Perry Turnbull have added muscle to the Blues , something which has been missing since the Plager brothers hung up their skates . They , like the Plager , brothers , can fight , too , as they proved by handling Terry O ' Reilly . Turnbull took O ' Reilly twice and Maxwell fought him once . " He ' s Boston ' s tough guy , " Maxwell said . " And I think he scares a lot of players when they ' re coming into this town . I ' ll tell you something : Perry and I don ' t scare easy . We don ' t think he ' s so tough . We don ' t look for fights . We want to play hockey and make the playoffs . Then we want to go all the way to the Stanley Cup . But if somebody ' s looking for something , we ' re here . " Maxwell also had high praise for Liut . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He ' s almost as good as Gerry Cheevers . Not quite . But some day he will be . Cheevers is the best . " Liut was playing in his 18th consecutive game last night , but he said : " Ithasn ' t been a hard pace because the games have been spread out . I think we ' ve had to play back-to-back games only twice . " It ' s doubtful Cheevers will be able to play against Atlanta tomorrow afternoon or Denver on Sunday night . " I ' ll skate Friday and see what happens , " Cheevers said . " If there is pain , forget it and right now ( late last night ) the pain is tough . " It could have been a great night in the brief career of goalie Jim Stewart . It will not bruise his mind , what happened . That ' s not his nature . His confidence , his cockiness was one reason that coach Fred Creighton of the Bruins started him last night , about 12 hours after Stewart was called up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of excited , but I didn ' t think I was going to play , " said Stewart . He was asked if he were ready . " Sure , " he said . " I felt great in the pregame warmups and I didn ' t think I was nervous , but I must have been . Nothing went right from the first shot on . I couldn ' t stop a basketball . Three of their goals ( St. Louis got five in the first period ) went through my legs and twice I moved too quickly . It was some kind of a shock to be here . " After the game , Stewart stood in the dressing room , the lone player , surrounded by media people . When three microphones were shoved in front of his face he smiled : " What ' s it like when we win ? " Creighton wasn ' t about to lift Stewart in the first period . " Then the goalies would be mad with me and I ' d have to play goal myself , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first period , the worst we ' ve played in quite a while . "
