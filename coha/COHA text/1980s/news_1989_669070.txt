This story is a composite of versions published in the various zones . He ' s known as the curbside confessor , but Rev. Charles Faso says only two people have made alfresco confessions in the eight years he ' s been at his post outside St. Peter ' s Church at 110 W. Madison St. " I just don ' t get a lot of people who want to confess outside , " says . Father Faso . " That ' s not the idea anyway . The idea is just to be present and available . By standing outside people will come up and ask things that they never could come inside to ask . " They ' ll be walking by and stop and say , Father , I just got divorced . Can I still take communion ? ' Or Jewish people will come up and ask , Why don ' t you eat meat on Fridays ? ' Or a lot of people will ask me to pray for them . For instance , one woman came up this morning and asked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Most people ask you to pray for them as if it ' s something I ' m going to do later . But enough of these later ' prayers . I make them stop and take their hand and we do it right there . My praying for them later won ' t help them now . If they ' re asking for prayers , they ' re hurting right now . " Stands out in a crowd And so the priest stands on the sidewalk in the early morning sunshine . In simple sandals and the distinctive Franciscan garb ( a dark brown robe accented only by a white cord belt tied in three thick knots ) he sticks out as a holy anomaly among the rush hour parade of suits and ties , briefcases , buses belching fumes , taxicabs honking horns and businesswomen ' s track shoes rushing by . Welcome to the " emergency room for hope and healing in the Loop . " " That ' s what I like to call St. Peter ' s , " says the energetic 33-year-old . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a lot of business people and politicians because we ' re close to City Hall and the courts . We get a lot of people in here upset about divorces . And we get a lot of suburbanites who work late or early and can ' t get to their regular parishes . To some of them this is more like their regular church because they might stop in here three , four times a week and only go to their regular parish on Sundays . " It ' s all part of Father Faso ' s outreach program , which includes his streetside presence during rush hour and lunchtime . He doesn ' t preach or exhort . He just stands there answering questions , returning greetings and offering prayers to those who ask as a steady stream of people rush in and out of the church doors to catch a few minutes of mass between appointments . One businessman exits the church and Father Faso hails him in Spanish . The father and the man huddle . In broken bits of Spanish and English they converse . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon return , but says he first must travel to Florida for the baptism of his nephew . As the man disappears into the flow of pedestrians , Father Faso smiles about his own mastery of the tongue . " Not bad for a month of Spanish lessons , " he says . Another businessman slips a check into the priest ' s hand with an apology for missing a benefit ball the week before and then hurries off . The father tucks the check into his cowl , along with the " Say No to Drugs " bumper stickers that another passerby handed to him earlier . More greetings and inquires about relatives , and then Father Faso stops one grungy homeless type and asks if he ' s taking his medicine . Moments later , another street person extends a hand minus a few fingers and clutching a couple of quarters . He asks for cash but is referred to social workers who are based in the church twice a week . " We used to have a priest here who gave out cash , and it got so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church and everyone else was afraid to come in , " Father Faso says . " Now we have the social workers trying to come up with some long-term solutions . " An idea from New Mexico The whole idea for the sidewalk ministry came from a friar in Santa Fe . Father Faso says he was traveling as a liturgist consultant to churches , retreats and missions around the country when he observed the friar standing outside his Santa Fe church . " I was on the road all the time , and I liked that , " says the priest , who hails from Chicago Heights and decided in the 2d grade after his first communion that Jesus wanted him to be a priest . " I never wanted to be anything else . God knows me pretty well , and He probably figured He had to get His word in early . So I ' m a trained liturgist , and I liked going from place to place . When they first asked me to come here about 10 years ago , I did it kicking and screaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by all this marble . " But now I couldn ' t be happier , and when they made me pastor about a year ago it was like a dream come true because I can finally do all those things I wanted to . I believe there are three kinds of people in the world : dreamers , problem-solvers and implementors . I am defintely a dreamer . " Some of Father Faso ' s dreams includes providing a permanent home to a 12-step recovery program for addicts ; a Mothers Against Gangs group ; showings of videos and films on religion and social issues ; starting Bible study classes ; and hiring a music director and professional choir . ( Besides a master ' s in liturgy from the University of Notre Dame , Father Faso also has a bachelor ' s in music from De Paul . ) He has hired a liturgist coordinator and his sister as a program coordinator . " I figured if one Faso was good for St. Peter ' s , two could only be better , " he says . " It ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good thing is wonderful . ' " The party ' s over Between quoting Mae West and reciting the itinerary for his upcoming trip to Italy with a group of regular St. Peter ' s churchgoers , he bounces about the rectory giving an enthusiastic tour . He swings open the door to his office and then rushes over to a 3-inch-thick stack of computer printouts . " Yeah ! This is a historic moment , " he says with glee , and then dumps the printouts in the garbage . " It ' s over ! It ' s over ! Yeah ! " He begins to sing , " After the ball . . . " He catches himself . " That was the guest list for the benefit last week , " he says , plopping himself down in his chair as he begins to outline his next dream : He wants to establish an outreach counseling program at a table in the lobby of the First National Bank of Chicago across the street . If you get the idea that Father Faso is not your typical pastor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not your typical Roman Catholic church . " We don ' t have an actual parish , and that ' s not typical of regular Franciscan ministries , " he says , ticking off the handful of similar churches in downtown districts . " There ' s one in New York , one in Boston and one in San Francisco . Some people refer to them as convenience churches , but I like to think of it more as bringing God right into the middle of the marketplace . That ' s when I came up with the idea for the banner . " The banner hangs from a light pole out front . It depicts St. Francis and reads : " Our business is love . " Down to business " Everyone else is in business around here , " says Father Faso . " And so are we . But our business is love . And it gets results . One day a man on a business trip came into the confessional inside the church and said he hadn ' t been to confession in over a year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the banner because his business should be love , too , but lately it wasn ' t . " For a while I thought about establishing a regular parish , but then I decided against that . You see , actually we aren ' t all that unusual . The Franciscan order was established about 800 years ago , and traditionally the Franciscans served as traveling or itinerant preachers . Now we ' ve just reversed it . We ' re a church for the itinerants . " CAPTION : PHOTO : Tribune photo by Frank Hanes . Eternal moment : Rev. Charles Faso gives a blessing to a woman on Madison Street amid rush-hour bustle .
