Was onetime CIA Agent David Barnett a KGB mole ? <P> The news did nothing to improve the already tarnished reputation of the Central Intelligence Agency . In Baltimore last week , a grand jury indicted David Barnett , 47 , a former CIA covert agent , on a single count of selling top-secret information to the agency 's Soviet counterpart , the KGB . Barnett allegedly fed the Soviets details about a CIA operation code-named HABRINK , set up to collect data on Soviet weaponry systems . <P> Barnett , who was said to be living with his family in Bethesda , Md. , was expected to plead guilty this week . Though he faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment , he may receive a lighter penalty for confessing . It is the first public case of a CIA official giving secrets to the KGB . <P> A 1955 graduate of the University of Michigan , Barnett joined the CIA in 1958 and served as an analyst with U.S. Army intelligence units in South Korea and Washington , D.C. From 1965 to 1967 , he worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff officer in the directorate of operations , which ran the agency 's worldwide covert activities . In 1967 Barnett was assigned to a diplomatic post in Indonesia , where he was responsible for recruit ing local Soviet officials to spy for the U.S. He quit the agency in 1970 to run an antiques-exporting firm in Indonesia , but apparently continued to work for the CIA on a contract basis . At some point after his " retirement , " with his business on the verge of bankruptcy , Barnett was recruited as a KGB mole . <P> The most important information Barnett gave the Soviets concerned the CIA 's Operation HABRINK in the late ' 60s . Moscow was then supplying Indonesia 's President Sukarno with billions of dollars worth of military equipment . Indonesian naval officers , however , were selling some of the Soviet weapons , parts and manuals to the CIA . Barnett worked on the project under diplomatic cover . He may also have provided details on other covert activities he had known about during his directorate years . And as one former agency official put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIA minutiae : " the weaknesses of colleagues ; who was sleeping with whom ; who had a drinking problem ; who was unhappy-information that is really useful to them . " In any case , the notoriously stingy KGB did pay Barnett nearly $100,000 , and in 1977 it persuaded him to apply for staff positions on the Senate and House intelligence committees and the White House Intelligence Oversight Board . <P> Barnett failed , apparently because there were no openings . In January 1979 , however , he was rehired by the CIA as a contract agent ; 13 months later he abruptly resigned . By that time , both the CIA and the FBI were aware that Barnett was a KGB agent . In fact , TIME has learned that his links with the Soviets were known to some U.S. officials at least two years before the CIA rehired him . That , of course , raises a crucial question : Why was Barnett allowed to return to the agency ?                  @ @ @
