If the builders and operators of the world ' s fastest and most extensive high-speed rail network have their way , the orange bullet-shaped trains will also be streaking past some very different scenes in years to come : the countrysides of New York , Florida and other states. // In competition with train makers from Japan , West Germany , Britain and Canada , French rail companies are now pushing hard to sell the T.G.V. to state and local authorities in the United States interested in high-speed passenger railways. // " No one can rival our experience , " insists Michel Walrave , director of planning and research at the Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer , France ' s state-owned railway . The S.N.C.F. designed and operates the Train a Grande Vitesse , which , literally translated , means the train of great speed. // " We have the best technology , so we are confident any state interested in high-speed rail travel will recognize the T.G.V. ' s value , " added Cullen Dwyer , a spokesman for the TGV Company . The company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a state-owned French engineering group that manufactures much of the T.G.V. , and Franco Rail , a company that exports French railway technology . <> <> The U.S. Market // Suggested high-speed rail links in the United States where the French companies and other train manufacturers see a potential market include : // * A line between New York and Montreal that would pass through Vermont . Studies commissioned by New York State , Vermont , Montreal and the Province of Quebec have concluded that such a rail link would raise enough revenue to cover operating costs , but not all of its capital costs . Last week , officials from the four governments held a first round of talks with United States and Canadian bankers to explore ways of financing the project. // * Service in Florida from Miami to Orlando and Jacksonville . The state has established a commission empowered to grant a high-speed rail franchise and has set next July as the target date for inviting firm bids. // * A " Texas triangle " line linking Houston , San Antonio and Dallas , for which Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Inter-City Experimental train . The train is designed to reach speeds of 186 m. p. h. but has not yet entered service . Mr. Dwyer of TGV says : " We would like to see an objective , independent study of this project , which evaluated the functioning T.G.V. as well. " // * A link between Los Angeles and Las Vegas , Nev. , for which studies are now under way . <> <> Gentler Curves , Steeper Grades // To achieve high speeds , France opted for a train built as a single unit that runs at conventional speeds over existing track within a city but switches to special high-speed track in the countryside . The high-speed track has gentler curves than conventional lines but steeper gradients , which saves on expensive tunneling and earth cuts. // Several high-speed trains have been built or are in the planning stages in other countries , some employing radically different approaches. // Japan ' s Shinkansen " bullet trains " are basically similar to the T.G.V. , though they are somewhat slower , traveling at a top speed of 143 m. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special track to achieve its top speeds , but it is designed to be more flexible than the T.G.V. because its engine and coaches can be decoupled and the size of the train varied . <> <> ' Hovertrain ' Concept // Germany and Japan are also working independently on a magnetic " hovertrain " that would glide along a monorail track supported by magnetic forces at speeds of up to 310 m. p. h . But the French , who abandoned this idea a decade ago , say the track would cost at least twice as much as a new T.G.V. line , which can be built for about $4 million a mile. // A Canadian company , Bombardier Inc. , has manufactured a high-speed train now operating between Montreal and Ottawa . Although designed to run at 125 m. p. h. , the train has been plagued by troubles and is limited to a speed of about 80 m. p. h. // Britain is striving to build a " tilting " train that can sustain speeds of 125 m. p. h. on existing track . British Rail , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train in which the passenger coaches would " lean " inward on fast curves to keep passengers from being thrown out of their seats. // Italy is building a high-speed line between Rome and Florence , called the Directissima , that will cut the journey time from 3 hours 10 minutes to 1 hour 40 minutes . Austria is considering a high-speed line between Vienna and Salzburg , while Spain is planning one from Madrid to Barcelona . <> <> ' Not in the Picture ' // Compared with Europe , the United States is " simply not in the picture at all " when it comes to high-speed rail technology , S.N.C.F. ' s deputy director general , Raymond Monnet , said. // But while that makes the United States appear to be a tempting export market , European manufacturers of high-speed trains recognize that they must overcome America ' s preference for automobile travel. // " We are still having a love affair with the automobile in this country , so all our calculations are very conservative , " said John K. Lussi , director of rail marketing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referring to studies about the proposed high-speed line between New York and Montreal. // Such a service , with stops in Albany and Burlington , Vt. , would complete the 370-mile trip in about three hours , hitting speeds of up to 160 m. p. h . Current service on Amtrak trains takes eight hours. // French engineers say that 20 to 25 T.G.V. trains would be needed for the service , costing a total of about $200 million . Laying special high-speed track or improving existing track would add $1. 5 billion to $2. 1 billion to the bill. // At least one train manufacturer in the United States , the Budd Company of Troy , Mich. , has shown interest in the project , according to New York officials . <> <> Passenger Projections // Studies commissioned by American and Canadian officials suggest the service would attract 2. 5 million to 3. 5 million passengers a year , not enough to finance the huge capital costs. // French experts think those studies are unduly pessimistic . They contend that a T.G.V. line would generate 6 million or more new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Paris-Lyon run , which now goes on at lower speeds over older track to Geneva in 3 hours 40 minutes and to Marseilles in the south of France in 4 hours 40 minutes. // Last year , this service carried more than 13 million passengers , of whom some 6 million are considered new passengers who would have used other methods of transport or not made the trip at all. // About 2 million of these passengers were attracted away from existing airplane service , with another million taking the train instead of driving , according to the experts. // The T.G.V. line lost money in its first three years of limited operation , from 1981 through 1983 , but last year receipts covered costs and amortization , leaving the service with a profit of about $50 million . The S.N.C.F. expects to have paid off all T.G.V.-related debt by 1994 at the latest . <> <> The ' T.G.V. Atlantique ' Line // Last year , the French Government decided to build a " T.G.V. Atlantique " line linking Paris with Bordeaux , Nantes and Brest on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeds of up to 185 m. p. h. // " Now that we ' ve mastered the technology of sustained safe high speed , we ' re going to put the emphasis on comfort and prestige , " says Francois Lacote , the S.N.C.F. ' s chief T.G.V. engineer. // But France ' s ambitions for the T.G.V. do not stop there . Later this year , French , Belgian and German transport ministers will decide whether to build an international T.G.V. link that would cut the train time between Paris and Brussels from 2 hours 30 minutes to 1 hour 30 and take a further hour to reach Cologne , with a possible branch to Amsterdam. // And if Britain and France can ever agree to build a tunnel under the English Channel , the S.N.C.F. would want to run a T.G.V. line through it , making the trip between Paris and London in 3 hours and 15 minutes. //
