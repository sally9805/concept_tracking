No President in recent history has been as successful as Ronald Reagan in the presentation of self . By now , with his actor 's " naturalness " and with the superior technology available to him , Reagan has probably overtaken his role model , Franklin D. Roosevelt . This is appearance we are talking about , not substance , but in the age of TV and Reagan , appearance has just about superseded reality in political importance . <P> Reagan has just scored two propaganda triumphs . By excluding the press from the Grenada invasion , the Administration brought off a tidy military operation-without unsettling TV coverage of combat as it happened . Reagan 's second triumph was last week 's quick trip to Japan and South Korea . There the facilities of the armed services were all enlisted to ensure that the press could cover Reagan in glorious color and in time for the nightly news . In Grenada , the press was denied its primary role as an independent witness to actuality . In Asia , public relations was the actuality . The press that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but grudgingly admired how skillfully the Administration carried out its mission . In both triumphs the press was manipulated and outmaneuvered . <P> The press had been advised to expect a lot of ceremony and little of substance on the Far East journey ; no tense confrontation with foreign leaders of the kind Reagan dislikes . Fair enough . Good-will trips are valuable , and Reagan is good at them . But why then should Reagan on his return to the U.S. try to make more of it by proclaiming that as a result , the prospects of " peace and prosperity are better today than a week ago " ? Well , for one reason , because his advisers thought there may have been too much pictorial emphasis on the military in Korea , so perhaps he should get in a word about peace . <P> Along with the press corps went two sets of camera crews from the White House . One was the Navy videotapers who customarily record presidential travels for the archives . The other was from the Republican National Committee . At the Emperor 's dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for both crews ; the Navy was excluded while the Republicans got in . Space was so tight at the North Korean border that most of the regular press corps had to be left behind at a camp below , but the Republican camera crew was assigned a choice position . When these pictures become campaign commercials next summer , Reagan 's progress will be made to seem even more triumphant , albeit at one further remove from reality .
