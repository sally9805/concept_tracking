How his fourth novel came bouncing back from publishing houses 13 times , and how two of his earlier books , Legs and Billy Phelan 's Greatest Game , seemed doomed to remain a dyad rather than parts of the trilogy their author had planned . Enter a deus ex machina in the person of Saul Bellow , a Nobel laureate , no less , who administered a scolding to those who had rebuffed Kennedy 's manuscript and thereby inaugurated a streak of magic . When Ironweed finally appeared in 1983 , it won a fistful of awards , including the Pulitzer Prize , not to mention a sale to Hollywood for a big-budget adaptation ( Jack Nicholson ! Meryl Streep ! ) . Meanwhile  --  the narrative gets even better  --  Kennedy , now 60 , found himself the recipient of a MacArthur Foundation fellowship ( $264,000 over five years ) , diverse other honors , and that peculiar American status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the nice things about this story is that it happens to be true . But the inference that such a dream can materialize randomly for anyone with enough luck is certainly false . Kennedy 's good fortune has had the perverse effect of overshadowing his talent , of making him seem a lottery winner rather than an artist who finally gained the attention he deserved . Hence his fifth novel arrives at an opportune moment , providing a respite from the hoopla of recognition and a chance to examine anew what all the noise is about . <P> Quinn 's Book may at first prompt some head scratching , since it looks like a startling departure from the fiction that established Kennedy 's reputation .

While the city suffers a number of freak disasters on " this day of hellfire and ice , " Magdalena is chafed back to life by the indelicate and unnatural ministrations of John the Brawn , who pulled her out of the river . Then a hanged white man is discovered in a mausoleum on the mansion grounds , with a living black man shackled to his wrist . Next , a corpse buried some 70 years earlier is disinterred from this scene of fresh violence and removed to the house , where it promptly explodes . <P> The person who witnesses and reports all this is Daniel Quinn , an orphan approaching his 15th birthday who works for the roguish John the Brawn . This night is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is then that he falls helplessly in love with Maud and launches himself on the adventures that he will gradually learn to capture in words .
