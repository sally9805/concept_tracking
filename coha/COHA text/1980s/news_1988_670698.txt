The orchestra was firmly in collaborationist hands ; its long-time music director , Willem Mengelberg , had accepted a post in Hitler ' s cultural cabinet . Mr. von Karajan was politically acceptable , having been a Nazi for over a decade , far longer than most members of the party . The whole of Brahms ' s First Symphony and Strauss ' s " Don Juan " were recorded , a big undertaking in the day of short 78-rpm disks ; smaller pieces by Strauss , Beethoven and Weber were also done. // Most musicians learned of the recordings ' existence for the first time with the arrival of a new six-CD set entitled " Herbert von Karajan : The First Recordings " ( Deutsche Grammophon 423 526-31 , also including disks cut in Berlin and Turin from 1938 to 1942 ) . No biographical account I have read even acknowledges that Mr. von Karajan went to conduct in conquered Amsterdam . How is one to listen to the fruits of such a project ? // Third Reich recordings - there were many - were not extensively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , beginning in the mid-1970 ' s . Mr. von Karajan ' s have waited longer than some others ; according to Deutsche Grammophon , the conductor refused earlier requests because of his dissatisfaction with the performances , but relented when this reissue , marking his 80th birthday and the 50th anniversary of his recording debut , was proposed. // When artists with Nazi associations reappeared in Allied nations after the war , there were some demonstrations and boycotts . That has not been so for about three decades now , but the reissue of recordings actually made during their service to the Reich inevitably raises questions that are still troublesome . When the many records made by Karl Bohm in Dresden were reissued a few years ago by Electrola , one could not help reading between the lines of the original repertory choicesWorks that had previously been represented in the company ' s catalogue by Jewish interpreters stood in need of new Aryan versions. // The " Raucheisen Lied Edition " - German State Radio ' s unprecedented project to document in sound the whole corpus of German lieder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( excerpts have surfaced before ) . Listening to these hundreds of wartime performances of Schubert , Wolf , Strauss , Loewe , Brahms , Beethoven and others , one thinks not just of Mendelssohn and Mahler ( excluded , of course ) , but of Joseph Schmidt , once a star broadcaster who might have done many of the songs wonderfully , who fled for his life and lost it to typhus in a refugee camp. // Few today would argue that such records should actually be banned or destroyed , but there remains the question of how we hear them , and that question can not really be addressed until one acknowledges the questions that lie ( articulated or not ) behind it. // One concerns personal behavior : What precisely is the responsibility of the artist as citizen of a tyrannical or evil state ? To keep art going for art ' s and his fellow citizens ' sake , whatever the compromises ? To set art in opposition to the regime , whatever the risks ? To leave ? And then : What right have others to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil , or his failures to perceive it ? Is it to be asserted that the inner life and the outer life may not be compared , that the artist and the citizen can not be made answerable for one another ? Or if the artist must bear the citizen ' s guilt , what suffices for its expiation ? // These are thorny questions , and the answers come mostly in shades of gray . " My country right or wrong " was a popular slogan here not too long ago ; exactly how wrong does one ' s country have to go before the only proper course is to abandon it ? Events overtake people ' s mistakes , too . The world ' s collective failure to foresee the Holocaust is plain , but if Hitler had died in 1938 , if war and Holocaust had been averted , would we consider an individual ' s Nazi membership in 1933 any worse than , say , White Citizens ' Council membership in the American South 25 years ago ? Do we have any standing to address such comparisons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // But all this difficulty is clarity itself beside art ' s own relationship to moral behavior , to honor , to personal conviction . Has it any ? What are we to make of the fact that we love music and the Nazis loved it too ? When we hear a musical interpretation , do we hear the inner character of the musician , the fruit of his life ' s experience and ideals ? I believe that we do , though not in any simple or obvious way . The inner , artistic life may show strength where there is weakness in the outer life , but rarely do the two contradict each other or present wholly different natures . The true person can not hide. // These uncomfortable ambiguities are keenly felt , I imagine , by lovers of lieder who eagerly open the boxed LP sets of the " Raucheisen Lied Edition " ( distributed by Koch Imports ) . Here is a wealth of material recorded by singers of the stature of Hans Hotter , Julius Patzak , Elisabeth Schwarzkopf , Erna Berger , Frida Leider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years vocally . Michael Raucheisen , a prominent Berlin accompanist , was put in charge of chamber music and lieder for the radio , and he is the pianist on almost all the recordings. // Newly released installments cover Hugo Wolf ( 23850 and 23851 , 10 LP ' s in all ) , song cycles of Schubert ( 23570 ) and works of Liszt ( 23563 ) and Weber ( 23566 ) . There is a lot worth hearing in these sets . First of all , the general level of sheer singing is fairly high ; further , in some cases we have here strong interpretations by artists who did not record the songs in question in their postwar careers , or did so only past their best . Mr. Hotter ' s " Winterreise " and " Prometheus " are important statements ; Julius Patzak ' s " Schone Mullerin , " though technically insecure in many places , is a thoroughly engaged and rewarding interpretation , often surprising in its brio ( especially toward the end , where one is used to a pervasive sadness and slowness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from Erna Berger , who makes us realize that we have not since had a high soprano so good in lieder - and that the high tessitura of many Wolf songs makes this kind of voice very advantageous . And then there are discoveries of singers otherwise unknown ( like Clara Spletter , not long on voice but full of wonderful spirit for Wolf ' s Morike and Spanish songs ) or undervalued ( Wilhelm Strienz and Josef Greindl were fair-to-middling operatic basses after the war ; here , in dozens of songs , they are first-rate ) . // One is aware that some of the songs have been learned for the occasion and not lived with sufficiently ; it is also disappointing to realize that Raucheisen , for all his industry , is not a very stimulating presence at the keyboard . And whether or not it has anything to do with their feelings about the political and military situation ( some of these songs were recorded during periods of heavy bombing ) , there is a certain pall over the spirits of the participants ; too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something stood between the performers and the spirit they wanted to find . Still , what they managed carries rewards. // For all the adulation Mr. von Karajan has received at the helm of the Berlin Philharmonic and elsewhere , uneasiness about his Nazi associations has lingered more than with other artists. // Throughout his postwar career , Mr. von Karajan has explained his party membership as a routine requirement for taking the musical directorate in Aachen in 1935 . The archives show , to the contrary , that he joined the party in his hometown of Salzburg on April 8 , 1933 , with no immediate career change in view , only two months after Hitler ' s accession to power , and that ( having failed to pick up his membership card ) he joined again in Ulm , where he was music director , three weeks later . Roger Vaughan set out the details , and independent evidence confirming them , in " Herbert von Karajan " ( Norton , 1986 ) . The conductor asserted to Mr. Vaughan that the documents were false , without further explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. von Karajan has spoken often and fascinatingly of his long search for finding the most economical means for realizing his mental conception of orchestral sound : to set sounds in motion , overcoming the inertial resistance with the least possible disturbance or undesired jolt . This has been his great study and fascination ; in his greatest years he regularly achieved performances in which the ease , lucidity , effortless dynamic extremes , relaxed precision and coherence of orchestral playing were an authentic marvel . ( A wide selection from those years has been issued by DG in the CD series " 100 Masterpieces . " ) He has said that kind of control took him 40 years to learn , and so it is only to be expected that in the earliest recordings we can hear the machinery at work a little more obviously . The Beethoven Seventh ( Berlin 1941 , with the Staatskapelle rather than the Philharmonic ) is tense , stiff and driven . The Brahms First is more successful - the Concertgebouw sounds magnificent and the interpretation has remarkable sweep and motive power - but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result ; the reins are very tightly held . The " Traviata " preludes ( Turin Radio Orchestra , 1942 ) may fairly be called grotesque : impossibly , defiantly slow , the rubato and rallentandos under an iron control that becomes ludicrous and unmusical . All this the conductor later learned to do more smoothly , without changing the essential content of the interpretations. // But what is the content ? Much easier to observe in its continuity than to pin down . Control and lucidity , certainly , and tonal beauty , all made ends or " content " in them-selves ; sometimes something more than that , but not often a stimulating or enriching statement of the work ' s substance . Mr. von Karajan has recorded much of his repertory several times over , but it is not very interesting on other than purely technical grounds to trace his interpretations over the years ; he is one of the most impressive and accomplished of musicians , and as such genuinely to be admired , but not one of the most nourishing. // Already in 1939 , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent . I have disliked so many recent performances of the " Meistersinger " Overture as to begin wondering whether I just don ' t like the piece , but right away the Karajan-Staatskapelle recording , with its singing lines and careful balances , restored a memory of what is possible. // When the apprentices ' music comes in , however , it doesn ' t smile , and this is typical : Mr. von Karajan failed at lighthearted music in those days , and has only half-succeeded since . The opening pages of the " Fledermaus " Overture ( Berlin Philharmonic , December 1942 ) sound like the cracking of a whip ; put on Willy Boskovsky ' s Angel recording for contrast , and it sounds like a hearty handshake. // The weakest group in the set is the trio of Mozart symphonies made in Turin : The orchestra just isn ' t up to what the conductor had by then become used to , and the strain shows . But " The Moldau " and Tchaikovsky ' s " Pathetique " with the Berlin Philharmonic have their merits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty. // Throughout , one is aware of both the primitiveness and the naturalness of the recorded sound , in relation to what the great studios produce today . Already , too , the hand of Karajan the technological innovator is felt , though the efforts are sometimes naive ( for instance , the unnatural closeness of the solo flute in the Third " Leonore " Overture ) . The whole set amounts to a fascinating look at one of the most influential figures in 20th-century performance . <> <> The Listener ' s Response // A final question concerns reception , the listener ' s response when both the music and the surrounding facts are to be taken in . One listens to Patzak ' s " Schone Mullerin " and hears in its frailty , perhaps , some kind of vacillation or inner preoccupation . One thinks , perhaps , of another recording made so near the same time by Aksel Schiotz , who risked his life as the " Voice of the Danish Resistance . " Schiotz sounds so much more confident , manly , secure in voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cubit to his stature ? Or does our knowledge add it ? Can the two be separated , and would it be desirable to do so ? // Art is full of contradictory , confusing examples ( what do we make of the visionary , questing interpretations of Wilhelm Furtwangler ? He fought with the Nazis where Mr. von Karajan didn ' t , but still let himself be used by them ) . In the end there are no answers , only questions that are all the more important for the want of answers. // That does not mean that one has no right to come to conclusions about the behavior of individual artists , or to pursue speculations on the relation of the inner to the outer life . In the case of the musicians under review , it must be said at the least that they sat in orchestral chairs and sang in operatic roles that had , as they well knew , been shamefully taken from Jews , who had been deprived of property , had fled , or had been sent off east to God knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one can say more : that , very early on , he saw fit to make himself persona grata with a movement that was already in the business of displacing Jewish musicians - some of them conductors whose continued activity in Germany and Austria might have slowed somewhat the ascent of " Das Wunder Karajan . " It is quite likely that nothing worse than blind careerism lay behind the conductor ' s party membership ; still , even in a civilized regime , that is not a very admirable trait. // What has this got to do with music ? In the end , listening to the Raucheisen Lied Edition , one comes away with a profound sense of sympathy , questioning and pity : pity for these troubled souls , struggling or enduring with their national identity and their artistic heritage and their personal role in events . Perhaps one reason Mr. von Karajan ' s recordings do not awaken this feeling is that one searches in vain - and here I am speaking of the musical interpretations , not the biographical facts - for any sign that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
