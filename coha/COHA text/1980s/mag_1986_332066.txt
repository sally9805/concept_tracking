" I was never really comfortable eating in restaurants , " confesses Mariel Hemingway . But her worries about upstaging the cuisine appear to have piqued her appetite for entrepreneurship . Last January the actress and her husband , Restaurateur Stephen Crisman , opened Sam 's Cafe on Manhattan 's East Side . With Crisman 's background , the move might seem natural .

I 've always been known as a Boston athlete , and this is one way I could become a New Yorker . " <P> Sometimes , by no coincidence , a celebrity partner may attract celebrity friends , who in turn attract a crowd . Actress Helena Kallianiotes , owner of Los Angeles ' Helena 's , has been known to serve her specials to her Five Easy Pieces costar and suspected silent partner Jack Nicholson . The joint is now about as in as any place off the eaten path gets . And if they are not part of the show themselves , show-biz proprietors know how to put one on .
