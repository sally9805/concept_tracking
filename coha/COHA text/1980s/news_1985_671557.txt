Moreover , with typical Texas boldness , they are taking over some of the " bad parts of town , " hoping the gentility of their shiny new stone and glass structures in otherwise rundown neighborhoods will attract pin-striped tenants. // Fact is , with the office market severely depressed in Houston and Dallas , and with other major urban centers substantially awash in vacant office space , Washington has become one of the choice sites for developers the likes of Trammell Crow , Gerald Hines and Cadillac Fairview. // And despite Washington ' s rather harsh building and zoning restrictions , the Texans are putting up some of the biggest buildings and paying some of the highest prices , partly be-cause they entered the local building boom so late. // Even a member of the secretive billionaire Bass family from Fort Worth , 38-year-old Robert Bass , has been buying real estate , counting out the price in millions . In the past few months he has reportedly dropped $4 million for three homes in Georgetown at what agents say was at least twice the market price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Grant. // " Most of the nation ' s downtown markets have vacancy rates of as much as 20 percent , " said William B. Alsup , vice president in the Washington office of Gerald D. Hines Interests , a Houston-based developer . " Washington has a 6 percent vacancy rate by comparison. " // Local demand for new office space has risen dramatically in the last two years . After averaging about two million square feet in the late 70 ' s and early 80 ' s , new office space was bought at a rate of three million square feet a year in 1984 and 1985. // " If that continues , the market will be close to equilibrium before long , " said Chris Roth of the Dallas-based Trammell Crow Company , foreseeing the possibility of no vacancy at all. // To be sure , the structures that the Texans are putting up here are a far cry from the 40- to 60-story monoliths that now form the Dallas and Houston skylines . They tend to be no taller than 14 stories , which is about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subdued so as to fit in with the surrounding capital ambiance . And their tenants are not much more flamboyant than big law firms , accounting firms and trade associations . Will Gambles Pay Off ? But perhaps most important , they are expanding the far edges of the business district , away from K Street and Connecticut Avenue , east past 15th Street , taking over heretofore depressed neighborhoods. // " All of their locations are marginal , " said Donald A. Brown , a principal of the JBG Companies , a Washington developer . " And they have paid higher prices than local developers were willing to pay . It ' s Texas aggressiveness. " // Yet Mr. Brown and others anticipate that the gambles will pay off. // Mr. Crow ' s deep-pocket firm , for example , will be tearing down buildings on 14th Street , in the capital ' s customary red-light district , so as to erect a 353 , 000-square-foot office building on the southwestern corner of Franklin Square , the second largest square in the city . ( His move is somewhat like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erect a giant merchandising mart . ) Franklin Square has indeed become a Texas watering hole . Cadillac Fairview , a Dallas-based concern , is planning a 400 , 000-square-foot building on the northeast corner , and Mr. Hines has just assembled a lot on the southeast corner that will boast a 460 , 000-square-foot office building. // In addition , the Hines Interests ' first project , on 13th and F Streets , is also in a heretofore depressed area . In an adept maneuver , Hines commissioned the architect I. M. Pei to design the building and negotiated a deal with one of Washington ' s largest law firms , Hogan &; Hartson , to occupy 230 , 000 feet of the 620 , 000-square-foot building . The Columbia Square project , featuring a 13-story atrium , is scheduled for completion by mid-1987. // " They are doing the city a major service by upgrading these neighborhoods , " said Mr. Brown , who is also an adjunct professor of real estate at Harvard Business School. // " We think the next areas of office development are clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pennsylvania Avenue east of the White House became the center for building . Those sites have now been mostly developed or taken . Over the next three years , we think the next area will be the Franklin Square area . And in the early 1990 ' s , builders will be filling in between Pennsylvania and Franklin Square . Only after then will the business district expand past 12th Street. " // Adding to hopes for continued business vitality in downtown Washington is the Federal Government ' s need for office space , which continues to expand despite budget cutbacks and that fact the Government already occupies 30 million square feet in private office space . The Government ' s presence assures that the major law firms , lobbying and accounting concerns will remain nearby. // " Washington is also first on the list for foreign investors , " Mr. Brown said . " They know there will be a stable environment for years to come. " // Since the Texas developers were rather late in coming to the game , they have found it more expensive to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not Local Builders ' // " We ' ve all had to pay a premium because we ' re not local builders , " said John Shooshan , vice president and Washington manager of Cadillac Fairview. // But , true to form , the company is in the process of finishing the largest private office building in the city , a 750 , 000-square-foot , $150 million structure at 1001 Pennsylvania Avenue , just east of the White House . And in addition this and the Franklin Square project , it is also working on a four-million-square-foot suburban development project in Fairfax County , Va. , out near the Beltway. // " People might say we paid too much , " said Mr. Roth of the Crow company . " But we bought them and others didn ' t . We ' re there. " //
