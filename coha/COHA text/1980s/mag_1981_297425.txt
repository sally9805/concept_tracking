A maestro 's mastery , a virtuoso 's debut , afresh look at genius <P> Wagner : Parsifal ( Tenor Peter Hofmann , Bass-Baritone Jos van Dam , Mezzo Dunja Vejzovic , Bass-Baritone Siegmund Nimsgern , Herbert von Karajan conducting the Berlin Philharmonic and Deutsche Oper Berlin Chorus ; Deutsche Grammophon , five records ) . Wagner 's last and most difficult music drama has not had a really satisfying recording-until now . Hofmann makes Parsifal both strong and guileless , the splendid Van Dam is an anguished Amfortas , and Nimsgern is an evil , but not inhuman Klingsor . Only Vejzovic , a screechy Kundry , is weak . The real stars are Karajan and his Berliners , who capture the score 's glowing spirituality and black magic in a luminous performance . <P> Chopin : Piano Sonata No. 2 and other works ( Ivo Pogorelich , piano ; Deutsche Grammophon ) . The fastest way to a big career these days seems to lie in not winning a major competition . When Pianist Youri Egorov failed to make the finals of the Van Cliburn four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalent of the first-prize money themselves . Similarly , when Yugoslav-born Ivo Pogorelich , 22 , was eliminated before the last round of the recent Chopin competition in Warsaw , one judge , Pianist Martha Argerich , resigned in protest . The incident became a musical cause clbre . Pogorelich 's first U.S. record includes wayward but ultimately persuasive interpretations of the Chopin Funeral March sonata and six shorter pieces . Lightning tempos in some works , such as the C-sharp-minor Scherzo , display his formidable technique , while the slow E-flat Nocturne , Op. 55 , No. 2 , allows the pianist to show off his ravishing , sensuous tone . <P> Hamilton Harty : An Irish Symphony <P> ( Bryden Thomson conducting the Ulster Orchestra ; Chandos ) . Sir Hamilton Harty ( 1879-1941 ) is probably best known in America as a reorchestrator of Handel 's Water Music . But Harty , born in County Down , was also a composer and conductor . The Irish Symphony mixes such well-known tunes as The Girl I Left Behind Me with Gaelic airs and original melodies to produce a score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur Sullivan 's . <P> Mozart : The Symphonies , Vol. 5 , Salzburg , 1775-1783 ( The Academy of Ancient Music directed by Jaap Schroder , violin , and Christopher Hogwood , harpsichord ; L'Oiseau-Lyre , four records ) . How did Mozart 's music sound in Mozart 's day ? The Academy of Ancient Music , one of Britain 's best original-instruments ensembles , is answering the question with its traversal of 68 Mozart symphonies-27 more than the commonly accepted 41 . They are played on 18th century instruments or modern replicas , which are tuned slightly lower than their modern counterparts . Such familiar works as the " Hajffher " and " Linz " symphonies emerge with new freshness and vitality ; by comparison , versions on modern instruments sound stodgy and inflated . A major reevaluation of the classical style , the project is one of the most important in the history of the phonograph.
