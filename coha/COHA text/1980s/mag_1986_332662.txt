Unlike most military-aircraft makers , Continental RPVS is happy to see its planes go down in flames . Since 1981 the Barstow , Calif. , company has been building radio-controlled replicas of fighter jets and selling them to U.S. military bases for target practice . Continental 's remotely piloted vehicles bear the authentic markings of , say , a Soviet MiG-27 but are only one-fifth or one-seventh its size . As the RPVs fly through flak from antiaircraft guns , onboard electronic devices record the hits and near misses and send the information to a computer on the ground . <P> Continental planes , which cost up to $30,000 , occasionally elude their attackers , but most buy the farm . As a result , sales are , well , taking off . The company 's profits were $800,000 in 1985 , and are expected to double this year . And President Ross Leggitt is seeking to widen his wars . He has already sold a few planes to the Canadian army , and is now setting his sights on the armed forces of Central and South America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
