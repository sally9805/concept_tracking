The worst enemy facing South Korea 's squabbling opposition , the New Korea Democratic Party , is often itself . Last week the party 's two best-known leaders , Kim Dae Jung and Kim Young Sam , broke away and formed a new group , the United Democratic Party , to protest the views of New Korea Party President Lee Min Woo . <P> The two Kims and Lee split over election procedures for selecting a successor to Strongman President Chun Doo Hwan , who has said he will step down in ten months . The Kims prefer an American-style presidential election and accuse Lee of being sympathetic to the government 's proposal for an indirect parliamentary vote , which could favor a candidate from Chun 's ruling Democratic Justice Party . Yet the real winner of the squabble will be Chun , who once again will be dealing with feuding factions .
