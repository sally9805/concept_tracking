Q. What ' s rarer than snow in Miami Beach ? A. A tourist in Cleveland . Q. Why don ' t people go fishing in Cleveland ? A. Because the river ' s on fire . Q. What ' s the difference between a month in solitary confinement and a night in Cleveland ? A. That ' s what I say , what ' s the difference ? Q. If you put Cleveland up on wheels , what would it be called ? A. Detroit . Cleveland has heard all the jokes . It ' s had it up to here with the Johnny Carson zingers and the Henny Youngman one-liners . It ' s sick unto death of being grouped with Detroit and Buffalo as the put- down capitals of the United States . The baseball All-Star game was Cleveland ' s chance to fight back , to prove it was more than an overgrown steel mill . The city had had enough bad publicity about kiddie-car mayors and rivers on fire and school closings and fiscal disaster and a central city that turned into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an opportunity to prove the city was on its way back , and that its people were proud to live there . The game was a stage to tell the nation about the cultural advantages of Cleveland - its fine symphony orchestra and Play House and Museum of Art and boating on Lake Erie . However , the baseball strike has put the All-Star game on hold . It was scheduled for next Tuesday , but certainly won ' t be played then . Unless the strike is settled soon , it won ' t be played at all and the nation will continue to regard Cleveland as a synonym for terminal boredom . The city , out an estimated $5 million in money the All-Star game would have brought in , will sink back into the primeval mud the wise guys consigned it to long ago . Virginia Felderman of The Greater Cleveland Growth protests this loser ' s label . She says the old cliches no longer apply to her city . " Cleveland has made a big turnaround in the last two years , " Felderman said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvements . Even if there is no All-Star game , she said , the city is going through with the pregame celebrations . These include a family fare party Sunday afternoon in the public square and an All-Nation Festival on the mall the next night . In addition , the renovated 52-story Terminal Tower will be lit in a dramatic ceremony at 9:30 Monday night . " We ' re sorry all the out-of-town visitors won ' t be here to see our city on the move , " said Felderman , " but Clevelanders are still looking forward to the fun . " The only time most of America gets a glimpse of Cleveland Stadium is on television , when the Browns are playing in a blizzard or a cold rain that turns the field into a hundred-yard mudpie that never does recover , even in the summer . The place has never resembled an elysian field . However , the lack of recent activity has turned the park into a jewel . " It ' s a sad thing , " said Al Frielander , the manager of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never saw the place look so good . The grass is marvelous . Even Dave Garcia ( manager of the Indians ) said he never saw a ballfield look better . " Frielander has about $30,000 worth of All-Star helmets , mugs , cups , patches , pennants and T-shirts , but doesn ' t think he ' ll be stuck with them even if the game isn ' t played . " They ' ll be a cinch to get rid of , " he said . " I ' ll set up some novelty stands at the public-in-the-park night . Then I ' ll run a big sale at the Stadium , open up one gate , and I ' m in business . If I ran a display ad in the local papers , I bet I ' d be sold out in one week . " For the Cleveland baseball club , the strike has meant uncertainty and disappointment . Everything ' s ready for the show , but the stars won ' t come out of the dressing room . Fifty-thousand programs , with color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are having good seasons , have already been printed . Public relations director Bob DiBiasio said the Indians have had an offer to sell all 50,000 programs to one bidder , who obviously has plans to resell them as novelty items . " Hey , get them while they last , folks , a unique , once-in-a- lifetime program of the All-Star game that never was played . " DiBiasio said the power-lunged Rocco Scotti was set to belt out the Anthem and Elston Howard ' s daughter Cheryl was to sing " O Canada . " Bob Feller and Warren Spahn were to be the honorary team captains . The only thing not decided , he said , was who would throw out the first ball . Maybe , instead of somebody throwing out a baseball , baseball ought tothrow out Marvin Miller and Ray Grebey.
