The chairman , William P. Rogers , made the exasperated comment near the end of a third consecutive day of testimony indicating that warnings on shuttle safety were not fully understood or acted upon . There has also been testimony that the warnings were not brought to the attention of the officials who decided to launch the Challenger on Jan. 28 , when it exploded shortly after liftoff , killing the seven astronauts aboard. // Today ' s session marked the close of public hearings on the decision-making process before the launching. // Officials of Rockwell International , which builds the orbiter capsule that carries the astronauts , testified today that they had explicitly warned key officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that it was unsafe to launch the Challenger because ice on the pad might damage the spacecraft . <> <> Issue of Ice Damage // However , NASA officials insisted that they had received no such explicit recommendation against launching , but simply an expression of concern from Rockwell over the ice , which further analysis by the space agency ' s engineers showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a NASA ice specialist testified on Wednesday , films of the flight showed no evidence of any ice damage to the shuttle. // Although cold weather is under investigation as a possible factor in causing the disaster , the chief theory is that cold temperatures might have weakened the synthetic-rubber seals that prevent hot gases from escaping from the shuttle ' s booster rockets ; the gases could have caused the shuttle ' s giant fuel tank to explode . Photographs released at today ' s hearing by NASA provided further evidence of a large puff of smoke emerging from an area near the seals shortly after the engines ignited . <> <> Rockwell Concern on Cold // No one has suggested that icicles that formed on the launching pad and related structures played a role in damaging the seals . Thus today ' s testimony about Rockwell ' s warnings dealt mainly with the process by which NASA launching officials handled such warnings. // Rockwell was the second major contractor to express concern over launching in cold weather. // Previous testimony disclosed that engineers from Morton Thiokol Inc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless the temperature were in the 50 ' s . The engineers feared that the rocket seals might fail because of the cold , but after middle-level NASA officials said they were " appalled " and " surprised " by the Thiokol concerns , executives at Thiokol overruled the company ' s engineers and recommended that the launching proceed. // Today , Rockwell officials offered somewhat conflicting and ambiguous explanations of what they had said to NASA before the launching . Robert Glaysher , a Rockwell vice president , reading from notes made at the time , said he had explicitly told launching officials , " Rockwell can not assure that it is safe to fly. " // He said Rockwell " had no data base " that would allow it to calculate whether the large icicles and ice sheets that had formed on the launching structure would ricochet about when the shuttle rockets fired and perhaps damage the shuttle vehicle . But shortly thereafter he testified that Rockwell ' s position was equivalent to saying that " it was unsafe to fly. " // After one commission member , Maj. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that advice should be firmly for or against launching and not simply " maybe , " another witness , Rocco A. Petrone , president of Rockwell ' s space transportation systems division , testified that Rockwell had reached " a conclusion that we ' re not safe to fly. " // After NASA decided to go ahead with the launching anyway , Mr. Petrone said , he made no further effort to dissuade the lauunching officials because " I felt I had done all I could do . " <> <> Matter of Interpretation // Arnold D. Aldrich , the second-ranking NASA official in charge of the launching , testified that he had understood Rockwell to voice concerns about whether ice might damage the shuttle orbiter ' s fragile thermal protection tiles , which protect the astronauts from burning up when they re-enter the atmosphere . But he said he did not understand this as " an objection to launch , " adding , " they did not intend to ask me not to launch. " // Mr. Aldrich said he had NASA engineers from both the Kennedy Space Center in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Houston calculate how the icicles on the launching structures would fall when the rockets and main engines shook the structure . The conclusion , he said , was that the ice should not hit the shuttle , and if it did , only very small pieces would hit and thus do no damage. // This calculation was not disputed by Rockwell , he said . If Rockwell officials felt launching was " a bad action to take , " he said , they should have called and said so . " I would not have overruled a no-go discussion from the Rockwell team , " he added. // Mr. Aldrich said he knew nothing about the concerns raised by Thiokol engineers that cold might damage the rocket ' s seals until after the launching and explosion had occurred. // Three other NASA officials , including Jesse Moore , the agency ' s top shuttle official who gave final approval for the launching , testified that they did not understand that Rockwell was opposed to taking off . " The thought did not cross my mind that Rockwell was saying no-go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chairman // Mr. Rogers complained that there was " a serious deficiency in the process " if NASA and Rockwell could have such different understandings as to what Rockwell had recommended . One suggestion made at the hearing was that perhaps contractors should be forced to to sign a document making an explicit go or no-go recommendation when they participate in such discussions of safety issues. // Mr. Rogers indicated that the commission has now completed public hearings on how the decision to launch was made and has already reached one major conclusion . Earlier he said that the decision-making process " may have been flawed . " Today , he asserted unequivocally , " We think it is flawed. " // The process , he said , " as it worked in this case was clearly flawed , " largely because warnings against the launching by two contractors , Rockwell and Thiokol , were not fully understood or were not conveyed fully to the senior officials who finally approved the launch. // Mr. Rogers also expressed " personal unhappiness " at learning so late in the investigation how strongly Rockwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NASA officials should have been more " forthright " in making that known to the commission earlier. //
