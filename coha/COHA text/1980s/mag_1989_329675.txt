The twin fetes had all the glitz and hoopla of a Hollywood premiere . Champagne flowed freely , and soft jazz whispered in the background . Guests nibbled on caviar and smoked-salmon quiche . The big bashes , which took place on the same day this month in New York City and Los Angeles , were staged by Commodore Business Machines to kick off a $15 million advertising campaign , starring celebrities ranging from the Pointer Sisters to Tommy Lasorda , manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers . But instead of coming off as a preview , the event seemed more like a benefit for an aging star . <P> In this case the focus of attention was the Amiga , a personal computer introduced by Commodore four years ago , whose sagging sales and fading image the company is trying to repair . Said Commodore president Harold Copperman : " This is not a celebration of new technology . This is a strategic repositioning and repackaging . " <P> The Commodore show was symptomatic of what is taking place at many companies in the computer industry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the business has lost some of its pizazz . Many established companies are repackaging old technology rather than developing daring new products . Manufacturers of such big machines as mainframes and minicomputers are suffering from stagnant sales as customers turn to powerful but less expensive workstations and personal computers . At the same time , many customers are reluctant to buy new hardware because of a shortage of innovative software to provide fresh applications for the machines . <P> All told , the computer industry is entering a shake-out phase , in which slowing growth will force some companies to restructure or combine with healthier partners . Instead of the robust annual sales growth of 15% to 20% that the industry enjoyed in the early 1980s , computer revenues will expand an estimated 6% to 8% during the next few years . That pace would delight most industrialists , but among computer makers it represents an abrupt comedown . Profits are being squeezed even more . Last week the world 's No. 1 and No. 2 computer makers announced sharply lower earnings during the most recent quarter . IBM said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Digital Equipment 's earnings were off more than 32% , to $150.8 million . <P> While the industry has a few sizzling products like laptop computers , the overall sluggishness is hurting many businesses , ranging from supercomputers to software . Cray Research , the largest supercomputer maker , said early this month it will cut its work force about 7% because of slack demand . Mainframe manufacturer Unisys , which has reported operating losses of $79 million so far this year , plans to slash its payroll by 8,000 workers , or 9% . Wang , which lost $424 million during the past fiscal year , may be pushed into a merger . Former rising stars in personal computers , notably Commodore and Wyse Technology , are losing money . So are major software developers , including Ashton-Tate and WordStar International .
