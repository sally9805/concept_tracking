A 24-hour cable TV news hookup aims for prestige and profits <P> He has been dubbed the " Mouth of the South , " " Captain Courageous " and " Terrible Ted . " A 1978 biography described him as " handsome , loud , opinionated , arrogant ; a self-styled Rhett Butler . " Even his enemies say he is fearless . His friends call him a visionary . " Goddam , " Ted Turner says , " of all the things said about me , I like that the best . " <P> Turner has earned that label by betting $100 million that there is a demand for television news 24 hours a day , seven days a week . The vehicle for his wager is Cable News Network , due to begin broadcasting this week . To mark the inaugural , President Carter agreed to an interview with Daniel Schorr , CNN 'S chief Washington correspondent , and George Watson , the Washington managing editor . A number of large communications companies have considered cable TV news operations but rejected the idea as too costly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risky business . No one else wanted to take the risks . " <P> CNN will have an annual operating budget of $25 million , compared with more than $100 million each for the news divisions of CBS , ABC and NBC-and they fill only about an hour of air time a day . At the outset , CNN will be able to reach only 2 million of the 16 million homes now wired for cable , while the three major networks can reach almost all of the 76 million U.S. homes with TV sets . But Turner is convinced that there is a greater appetite for news than the networks can satisfy . " Because of ratings pressure , they tend to dwell on catastrophe-dictators assassinated , seagulls covered with oil , volcanoes erupting , charred bodies , " he says . ' ' The only time they tell you what 's going on in Washington is when some Senator has gotten caught with his hand in the till . " <P> Turner will counter the networks with what he considers an electronic newsmagazine . Some weekday highlights : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a half-hour of financial and business news at 7 p.m. ; a prime-time newscast from 8 to 10 ; a call-in talk show at 10 with Sandi Freeman , a former Chicago TV personality ; a half-hour of sports at 11 ; and at 1 a.m. a celebrity interview show from Los Angeles with Lee Leonard , ex-host of NBC 's Grandstand show . Scheduled throughout the day are reports on such topics as health and nutrition , law , fashion , pet care , astrology , gardening and home repairs . Turner has also signed up a roster of big-name commentators , including Senator Barry Goldwater , ex-Congresswoman Bella Abzug , Consumer Advocate Ralph Nader , former Treasury Secretary William Simon , Political Columnists Richard Reeves , Rowland Evans and Robert Novak , Psychologist Joyce Brothers and ERA Opponent Phyllis Schlafly.
