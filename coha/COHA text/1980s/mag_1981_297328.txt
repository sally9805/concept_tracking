LENA HORNE : THE LADY AND HER MUSIC <P> If she had had her way , says Lena Horne , she probably would have been a schoolteacher , telling children about the three Rs . Lucky children ! Fortunate parents ! Celestial meetings of the P.T.A. ! But with all due respect to the nation 's teachers , one must add that it is truly the impossible dream . On opening night last week it was hard to imagine the lady anywhere else than on the stage of Broadway 's Nederlander Theater , where she was doing what she was obviously born to do : singing , strutting and enchanting audiences . <P> The show , which will run through the summer and then go on to San Francisco and London , displays Horne in all her moods-all 10,000 of them . <P> She is cool and she is hot , sultry and cerebral , soft and brassy - loud enough to wake the folks in New Jersey . She does her standards , like Ca n't Help Loving Dat Man of Mine , and successfully essays a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surrey with the Fringe on Top . When she begins Rodgers and Hart 's Bewitched , Bothered and Bewildered , a premonitory shudder passes through the theater . She does not disappoint , and the words- " I 'm a rich , ripe , ready plum again " - are not sung but caressed , as if they were old friends , which they clearly are . Sixty-four next month , Horne has not only been around , she has been all around for a long , long time . <P> Her career provides a capsule history of the black experience in show business . Her mother was an actress who always wanted to be what Lena is now , glamorous and successful , and her father was a gambler and numbers runner . The first five years of her life she spent mostly with her grandparents in Brooklyn , where she was born ; after that she was boarded out with families in the South while her mother toured with acting companies . The acting did not bring in much money , however , and when she was 16 , Lena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chorus of Harlem 's famous Cotton Club . It was not a happy time . Working conditions backstage were terrible , pay was bad , and when Lena 's white stepfather tried to get her a bigger role , the club 's white owners beat him up and pushed his head into a toilet bowl . After joining another band , she recalls , " I literally ran away and married the first man I met . " <P> The marriage produced two children , a boy and a girl , and then ended . Horne found her real happiness at the old Caf Society Downtown in Greenwich Village , at that time " the one place in New York that had a mixed audience . " With other performers , like Billy Daniels , Billie Holiday and Paul Robeson , she found the family life she had always wanted . Robeson was both father and teacher , and after the show was over , the two of them would often talk until dawn . " He 'd tell me about black people , about my people , my grandmother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things I had missed when I was living with strangers . "
