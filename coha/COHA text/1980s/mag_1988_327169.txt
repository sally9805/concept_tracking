With restaurant fever still epidemic in the U.S. and the national passion for " take-out " almost as strong , it is a bit surprising  --  and heartwarming  --  that publishers keep investing in cookbooks . Clearly , they believe there are plenty of old-fashioned souls who persist in doing their own cooking , if not for workaday meals , then at least on weekends and for guests . In fact , that is the tone of this year 's better cookbooks . They tend to emphasize dishes that are stylish and special , though without the fussiness seen in recent years . <P> American regional cooking remains well represented on the nation 's bookshelves . But now , as palates tire of the green chili , blue cornmeal and black beans of the Southwest , attention is turning to the vivid and ethnically mixed cuisine of the Pacific Northwest  --  with its salmon and oysters , wild berries and herbs , tree fruits and game . The best culinary guide to the region is Northwest Bounty by Schuyler Ingle and Sharon Kramis ( Simon &; Schuster ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country to try piquant specialties like pickled Walla Walla sweet onions and such cross- cultural inventions as Sichuan pepper-broiled salmon with cilantro sour- cream sauce . <P> New American cooking is the theme of The Trellis Cookbook by Marcel Desaulniers ( Weidenfeld &; Nicolson ; $25 ) . Unlike most recipes from restaurant chefs , these from the Trellis Restaurant in Colonial Williamsburg can be managed by mere mortals with only two hands . Some dishes have many steps ( grilled smoked lamb with artichokes and slab bacon on fresh-thyme fettuccine ) , but Desaulniers outlines how to organize ahead . Corn and tomato fritters , roast loin of pork with walnut butter and a chocolate-praline ice cream terrine are winners . <P> If you think you 've heard the last word on pasta , then you have not read Giuliano Bugialli 's new work , Bugialli on Pasta ( Simon &; Schuster ; $24.95 ) . This time the exacting cooking teacher presents a magnificently clear illustrated work not only on the rolling and shaping of pasta but also on the preparing of artichokes , squid and other ingredients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are such irresistibles as the pappardelle ( wide noodles ) with duck or lamb and cannelloni plump with a wild-mushroom stuffing . <P> Paula Wolfert 's World of Food ( Harper &; Row ; $25 ) is a solid , serious and sensuous collection of her favorite recipes , sprinkled liberally with her usual didactic asides . A specialist in the cuisines of Morocco , southwest France and the Mediterranean , Wolfert wanders afield and offers up not only caponata , the Sicilian vegetable appetizer , and the fragrant tagine stews of Morocco but also the lusty Alsatian casserole of meat , onions and potatoes known as backeoffe.
