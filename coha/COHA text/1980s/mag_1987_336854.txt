From Southern California to Texas , towering saguaros on front lawns are the hottest thing since plastic pink flamingos . The demand has encouraged an illicit industry : cactus rustling . Many of the specimens bought by homeowners and collectors have been stolen from Government-owned wilderness lands . In Arizona last year more than 200 thieves were fined or given warnings for digging up a variety of state-protected species , most of which have shallow roots . Conservationists are now lobbying for stricter state and federal laws to stop poachers , who are lured by substantial profits . Saguaros , which can take more than 100 years to grow to 6 ft. , routinely sell for $10 per ft. in height plus $50 an arm  --  and can fetch ten times that amount in Europe and Japan . For instance , a rare 19-ft. crested saguaro lifted from Quartzsite , Ariz. , turned up in a Las Vegas nursery with a $15,000 price tag .
