Bernie Grant , a Labor Party member , is the leader of the Haringey Council in north London , the highest-ranking elected black official in Britain . And he has been at the center of a storm ever since he gave voice to what many of the youths in Tottenham were thinking as they stoned and firebombed the police and hacked one officer to death three weeks ago. // The police , Mr. Grant said in an emotional speech outside the town hall two weeks ago , " got a bloody good hiding . " When asked at a news conference to condemn the policeman ' s murder , he said it was not clear who had done the killing , that it could even have been done by a policeman. // His remarks , made as the annual Conservative Party conference got under way , aroused such outrage at what was an otherwise bland , if slightly troubled , gathering that Mr. Grant was credited with having handed Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher " another Falklands " as a rallying point . <> <> Resignation Is Demanded // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000 mostly white union workers in Tottenham , who marched on the Haringey Civic Center to protest his remarks . Roy Hattersley , deputy leader of the Labor Party , assailed him , and there have been many predictions that Mr. Grant , who is Labor ' s parliamentary candidate in Tottenham , will now lose his party an absolutely safe seat. // There are no blacks in the House of Commons , although the Labor Party , under pressure from its Black Sections Committee , has six black nominees for the next election . If the furor over Mr. Grant ' s remarks indicates anything , black activists agreed , it is how rare it is for anyone in power to voice such views. // At Haringey Civic Center , a 1950 ' s concoction of glass , blond wood and stainless steel , where tiny ragged gypsy children dodge in and out of the traffic in the parking lot , Mr. Grant presents an appearance that is anything but fierce . As he ambled through the halls , wearing a rumpled suit , he had a smile and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to know their first names , white or black. // Mr. Grant is 41 years old , born in Guyana to parents who were school principals . The family was Roman Catholic , and before Bernie Grant emigrated to Britain at the age of 19 he had a Jesuit education - " the classics , Latin , and all this . " <> <> ' Pure and Absolute Racism ' // He sought work as a counter clerk in a post office and immediately ran into " pure and absolute racism , " as he recalled it . " You had to do a written test - you had half an hour to do it - and I did it in about 10 minutes , and the guy was really angry. // " He asked me all sorts of questions , and he couldn ' t trip me up on anything . Then he said , ' What ' s a ' tanner ? ' " - at that time a tanner was a sixpenny piece - " and I thought he said a ' tenner , ' so I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he almost leaped with joy : ' Ah , there you are , you don ' t know what a tanner is , so therefore you can ' t be a counter clerk. ' " // He did get work as a clerk , at British Rail in King ' s Cross . He studied mining engineering at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh but quit , he said , because only white students were given scholarships for work in the South African mines. // He became an international telephone operator and an activist in the National Union of Public Employees . While the telephone job was boring , he said , " the union job was really good because you had to pit your wits against the management. " // After a 1971 strike he joined the Socialist Labor League , a Trotskyist organization that became the Workers Revolutionary Party . He left in 1974 . A year later he joined the Labor Party . As time passed , he managed to keep his credentials as a grass-roots politician . <> <> ' Reality of the Situation ' // Asked about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought I said that the young people felt that the police got a bloody good hiding , but I don ' t know whether I said it or said that the youth are saying it . That ' s the reality of the situation , and that ' s what people don ' t want to face up to. // " I think my position is mild in comparison to that of the young people on Broadwater Farm Estates : people were overjoyed that a policeman had died . I never said all these things on television , but that ' s a fact . Absolutely. // " The young people had said they were prepared to die , that that was why the violence was so heavy . They were looking at the situation in South Africa as a sort of guide . They were saying there are black people dying in South Africa fighting for freedom - that ' s what they used to tell me - and they were prepared to die here , because there ' s a similar situation here : that the police oppress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " he continued , " is they felt I ' ve taken a lot of heat off the situation . I ' ve been like a safety valve : I ' m the leader of the Council . Usually a person in that position would have sold them out , would have condemned them or whatever . But along comes a person who has articulated what they ' e been saying . They can hear it on television. " // In the Labor Party , he said , race " is the one issue that the so-called extreme left and the right wing get together on quite happily. " // " They both adopt the position that we ' re all one class , the working class , and there is no race problem here , which of course is arrant nonsense . " <> <> Party Forms Black Sections // He and others have insisted that the Labor Party should have black sections , just as it has separate sections for women and young people . Party leaders have fought this , and party conferences have twice refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been set up in 35 inner-city constituencies. // " This issue really embarrassed a number of white left Members of Parliament who were always supporting the black people ' s struggles until they started threatening them in their safe inner-city seats with their huge black constituencies , " Mr. Grant said. // Marc Wadsworth , a television journalist and vice chairman of the Labor Party Black Sections National Committee , believes that Mr. Grant " is our most important candidate to date. " // " He must be defended , " Mr. Wadsworth said . " When he speaks , it ' s clearly a black perspective that is being articulated , and in some sense is quite an uncompromising perspective. // " The sort of things being said are the sort of things black people , particularly black youth , want to hear said by black leaders , whether white people find them palatable or not.
