Previously unpublished figures from the 1980 census show widening disparities between residents of central cities in metropolitan areas and those of their surrounding suburbs , not only in income but also in employment , housing , living arrangements and family structure . The findings were obtained from Census Bureau computer tapes processed for The New York Times by Market Statistics Inc. , a New York concern. // Some of the trends indicated by the new data are no surprise to authorities on metropolitan areas . Others provide new insights , some countering expert predictions , into the changes that the cities and suburbs experienced in the last decade. // // Division of Cities and Suburbs // Many of the patterns that emerge from the census , undertaken by the Government every 10 years , serve as major factors in establishing Federal policy on aid to regions and cities. // The new findings suggest that even more than in 1970 , when large sections of many big cities lay in ruins because of the riots of the 1960 ' s , the cities and the suburbs are two different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and living conditions of their residents , but by greater distances , as the suburbs have spread out across the countryside. // Examples of the disparities include the following : // - PERSONAL INCOME . In 1970 , the median household income in the cities was 80 percent of that in the suburbs . By 1980 , it was 74 percent . And the difference was even greater for old industrial cities . Baltimore , for example , had a median household income of $12 , 811 , just 58 percent of the median in its suburbs. // - BLUE-COLLAR WORK . In the past , many poor city dwellers have entered the labor market through blue-collar jobs . In the 1970 ' s , however , city dwellers holding such jobs declined by 5 percent , as against an increase of 20 percent for suburban residents . This provided a stronger and more diverse employment and income base for suburban dwellers . New York alone had 234 , 000 fewer blue-collar workers in 1980 than it had at the beginning of the decade. // - FAMILIES . A decline in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a national phenomenon of the 1970 ' s , but the decline was greater in the central cities than in the suburbs . By 1980 , a little more than one household in five in the central cities contained a married couple with children , as against one in three in the suburbs . <> <> Opposing Forces // Such trends persisted despite some contravening developments in the decade . Many cities in the West and South , such as Memphis and Houston , expanded their boundaries by taking in suburban communities. // Most cities , including New York , Chicago , Atlanta and Boston , experienced a downtown economic revival and construction boom along with restoration of old housing by the middle class . And many closein old suburbs , such as Yonkers , Richmond in the San Francisco area and East Point in the Atlanta area , began to decay and take on many of the characteristics of central cities. // While the new findings do not provide a complete picture of what happened to cities and suburbs in the decade , they tend to substantiate the findings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that downtown renewal and " gentrification " were not sufficient to reverse the decay in the older cities . The study , by Richard P. Nathan of Princeton University and other scholars , was tentative because some of the information was based on 1976 and 1977 findings. // Boston , widely proclaimed for its downtown renewal and resurgence of middle-class housing , suffered a loss of median household income over the decade , to $12 , 500 as against $20 , 469 in its suburbs . Even Dallas , with its population growth , expanded boundaries and fiscal health , showed a sizable disparity : $16 , 227 median household income in the city and $21 , 301 in the suburbs . <> <> Elderly in New Orleans // New Orleans has a far older and thus more dependent population than its suburbs have . In the city , 11. 7 percent of the people were 65 or older , compared with 7. 1 percent in the suburbs . In Detroit the disparity was almost as great , with 11. 7 percent 65 or older in the city and 8. 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 percent of the households contained a married couple with children , compared with 33 percent in its suburbs . A decade earlier , 29 percent of the households in the city and 44 percent in the suburbs had a married couple with children . In San Francisco the disparity was even greater . There , 13 percent of the households in 1980 had a married couple with children , while 27 percent in the suburbs did . In 1970 the respective figures were 19 percent and 40 percent. // New York , because of its size and history , is unique among cities . It is one of the few large cities with a population larger than its suburbs . In 1980 there were more than seven million people in the city to about two million in its suburbs , which were defined as Bergen County in New Jersey and Westchester , Putnam and Rockland counties in New York . Nassau and Suffolk counties on Long Island , with a combined population of 2. 6 million , are counted as a separate , all-suburban metropolitan area. // Yet New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes growing discrepancies between city and suburbs . In median household income , for example , suburban residents told census takers in 1980 that they received $23 , 740 in the previous year ; for city dwellers , it was $13 , 855 . <> <> Size of Central Cities // In 1970 the population of the central cities in the 305 metropolitan areas was about 68 million , as against 87 million for the suburbs . By 1980 , the central cities still had about the same population . Huge losses by Northern cities had been offset by growth and annexations in the South and West . But the suburbs had grown to 103 million , and in population , they outnumbered the urban centers that spawned them by three to two. // Together , the cities and the surrounding suburban counties made up three-fourths of the country ' s population . In the decade , minority groups became more concentrated in the central cities . Blacks made their first significant inroads into the suburbs , but nevertheless their numbers increased fastest in the central cities . In 1980 blacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of the suburban. // Commenting on this and other trends , Allan C. Ornstein , of Loyola University of Chicago , said : " After two decades of watching helplessly while their middle-class citizens pulled up stakes and headed for the suburbs , mayors and educators took heart during the 1970 ' s over a projected ' return to the cities . ' According to this hopeful scenario , a combination of commuting costs , condomania and urban renaissance would reverse the flight of the white middle class . With their return to the American City would come new jobs and new housing , an integrated city as well as integrated schools , an improved tax base and general urban prosperity . It didn ' t happen . " <> <> Incomes // When the census was taken in April 1980 , all residents were asked to report their cash incomes for the previous year . According to those reports , households in the central cities had a median income of $14 , 967 . After adjustment for inflation , the median reported in 1980 was $644 less than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the suburbs was $20 , 158 , which in 1980 dollars was $459 more than what was reported a decade earlier . And it was $5 , 191 above that for the central city. // Looked at another way , one in every three households in the cities had an income of less than $10 , 000 , about the amount the Federal Government said was necessary to sustain a family of four a little below the poverty level . In the suburbs , one in five households had an income under $10 , 000 . Those figures were reversed for incomes of $25 , 000 to $50 , 000 ; one in three suburban households were in that bracket , as against one in five for the central cities. // The differences become more pronounced when the older cities are separated from the newer ones . In San Jose , Calif. , for example , there was little difference between the median incomes : $22 , 886 for the city and $23 , 832 for the suburbs . In New York , by contrast , the difference was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts have worsened the disparities in incomes , according to studies done by the Joint Economic Committee of Congress and other authorities , with central city residents bearing the brunt of layoffs and reductions in Federal aid . <> <> Employment // In April 1980 the unemployment rate for men in the central cities was 7. 5 percent of the labor force , compared with 5. 6 percent in the suburbs . The national average at that time was 6. 5 percent , which was considered high before its march to more than 10 percent last year . There was a similar disparity for unemployment among women in 1980 : 7. 0 percent for the central city , 5. 7 percent for the suburbs. // But another statistic confirms reports that the unemployment rate does not reflect the full disparity in joblessness . In 1980 , 78 percent of males over the age of 16 were in the suburban labor force , either working or looking for work . But in the central cities only 73 percent were . The difference was that more males in the central cities had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unemployed. // The figures on employment are evidence of change developing in the roles of both the cities and the suburbs . Manufacturing employees , who once made up a major portion of city residents , have been moving in great numbers to suburban housing . <> <> Fewer Manufacturing Jobs // Nationally , manufacturing jobs have been declining relative to service and other employment , but the losses have had a disproportionate impact on the cities . In 1980 almost twice as many people were employed in manufacturing in the suburbs as in the cities , 10. 9 million to 5. 9 million . In the decade manufacturing employees in the cities declined by 426 , 817 , while the suburbs gained 1 , 621 , 980 such workers. // The figures do not tell whether people worked in the city or the suburbs , but previous surveys have shown that the number of jobs in the suburbs far surpasses the number in the cities . Many times , the workers follow the jobs by relocating , as in the St. Louis area , where a General Motors plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is out of reach for many city residents. // The figures do appear to demolish the myth that it takes considerably longer to go to work in the suburbs than in the cities . Based on workers ' estimates of their commuting time , in the suburbs the average was 23 minutes ; in the cities , 22 minutes. // Where the cities ranked ahead of the suburbs in the ratio of people employed was finance , insurance and real estate ; in health services , and in educational services , bearing out previous evidence that the cities have been expanding as centers for finance , colleges and medical complexes . Those institutions do not employ people in as great numbers as manufacturing plants , and thus the central cities so far have not been able to regain the economic base they enjoyed as the centers for great factories. // The cities and the suburbs were about even in the percentages of people employed in retail and wholesale trade . The suburbs , however , leaped ahead in construction and communications . <> <> Households // One of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the number of housing units over the decade , but how few people were living in them . The way people lived had been changed by strong and sudden social forces - divorces , fewer marriages , more elderly people left alone , more working single women setting up their own homes and a sustained housing boom . Nationally , the number of people per household declined from 3. 14 in 1970 to 2. 76 in 1980. // In 1970 , there was a wide disparity in household size between the cities and the suburbs . The suburbs had 3. 36 people per household , the cities 2. 99 . But by 1980 the gap had narrowed somewhat , with 2. 90 people per household in the suburbs and 2. 66 in the cities . But different and important causes were involved in the changes. // The cities still had a larger percentage of elderly people , who tended to live alone , 12 percent , compared with 10 percent for the suburbs . But the other end of the age scale was more significant. // The suburbs had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total population grew by 18 percent , the number of people under 17 declined by 5 percent . Much of the post-World War II " baby boom " generation , which had kept household size high in past years , grew up and left home in the 1970 ' s . <> <> Fewer Children in Cities // The percentage of children declined in the cities , too , as many middle-class families continued to move out to suburban homes . But the presence of large numbers of blacks and Hispanic people , who have a higher birthrate than the white majority , considerably slowed the decline in the number of city children. // In 1980 there were roughly 29 million children under 17 in the suburbs and 18 million in the central cities . Other figures point up some of the differences in how those children lived. // Suburban children were much more likely to live with married parents . Only 14 percent of suburban households with children were headed by an unmarried , divorced or widowed mother , but in the cities 27 percent were . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In New York , for example , one in every three households with children was headed by a single mother , while in the suburbs the ratio was less than one in seven . <> <> Alone in the City // As would be expected , more people live alone in the cities . Nonfamily households , the vast majority of which contain one permanent resident , made up 23 percent of the suburban total in 1980 . In the cities the percentage was 35 . But the trend to nonfamily households is strong everywhere . They increased by almost three million in the cities and by more than four million in the suburbs in the decade. // And finally , suburban people tend , to a much greater degree than city dwellers , to be homeowners , with all the economic security and tax write-offs that go with ownership . In the suburbs , 71 percent of housing units were owner-occupied in 1980 to 49 percent in the cities , about the same ratio that existed in 1970 . <> Next : Regional patterns. // ANALYSIS OF THE ' 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form that one in every five people was asked to fill out when the census was conducted in April 1980. // Although the findings are now almost three years old , the long-form survey is the only one that provides , once every 10 years , detailed characteristics of the entire population down to the neighborhood level . Annual surveys based on a much smaller sample provide national and regional trends , but they do not tell what has happened within counties , cities and metropolitan areas. // The Bureau of the Census was a year late in processing the longform information because of budget cuts and pressures for other information . To compensate somewhat for the delay , the bureau issued last spring what its director , Bruce Chapman , called " a sample of the sample . " It listed the major characteristics nationally , by states and for the larger metropolitan areas , but did not show any figures for cities and suburbs. // Late last year , the bureau offered for sale computer tapes containing the raw numbers from the long-form survey . The New York Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demographic information to clients , to provide printouts of selected information from the tapes to enable publication of more detailed findings of the 1980 census than has been provided by Census Bureau documents. // Edward J. Spar , the president of Market Statistics , assisted in preparing the data. //
