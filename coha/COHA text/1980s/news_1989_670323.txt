DEARBORN , Mich.  --  Ford Motor Co. ' s top executives received smaller bonuses last year than in 1987 , despite record earnings , as part of a plan to tie compensation more closely to achievement of long-range goals . But several of the officials offset the decline by cashing in on stock options . Chairman Donald E. Petersen , whose bonus fell 21. 4% , realized about $7. 2 million from exercising options in 1988 . This boosted his total compensation last year to $10. 5 million from $3. 7 million in 1987 , when he didn ' t exercise any stock options . The No. 2 auto maker also announced several expected changes in senior management that include adding Allan D. Gilmour , executive vice president , to the office of the chief executive . The move places Mr. Gilmour , 54 years old , third in corporate rank behind Mr. Petersen and Vice Chairman Harold A. Poling , and makes him the current likely successor to Mr. Petersen on the chairman ' s retirement , scheduled for 1991 . Ford disclosed the executive compensation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Securities and Exchange Commission . The documents show Ford ' s top 45 executives earned a total of $15. 1 million in salary last year , a 17. 1% increase from 1987 . But their bonus total fell 18. 7% to $24. 3 million from $29. 9 million . A Ford spokesman said the decline reflects the shift of some bonus funds to a Ford stock grant program adopted in 1986 . Grants are tied to achievement of personal and corporate performance objectives over a period of several  --  typically five  --  years . Thus , the executives ultimately might not receive any less in the long run than they otherwise would have , but it will take them longer to realize the income . As a result of the change , all five of Ford ' s highest-paid executives received lower bonuses in 1988 , pushing their total cash compensation below 1987 levels for all but one , Philip E. Benton Jr. , president of the Ford Automotive Group . A $121 , 618 rise in Mr. Benton ' s salary to $534 , 785 offset the $70 , 000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year . Mr. Petersen ' s salary rose 22. 6% to $1. 1 million , while his bonus fell to $2. 2 million from $2. 8 million in 1987 . Mr. Poling , the second-highest-paid Ford executive , received $951 , 281 in salary , a 17. 6% increase from 1987 levels , and $1. 6 million in bonuses , a 20% drop from $2 million in 1987 . The change in Mr. Gilmour ' s status includes a new title . Earlier indications from Ford sources that he would be named a vice chairman were incorrect . Instead , effective May 1 , he will become executive vice president , corporate staffs . His current title is executive vice president , international automotive operations . Still , Mr. Gilmour ' s new status is similar to that of Mr. Poling , the vice chairman and chief operating officer . Both men will report directly to Mr. Petersen ; two executives now are between Mr. Gilmour and the chairman . The only other Ford executive to report directly to Mr. Petersen is the general counsel . Ford ' s chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general counsel will report to Mr. Gilmour ; they previously reported to Mr. Petersen . Ford ' s operating staffs will continue to report to Mr. Poling , who is to retire in October 1990 . Ford also confirmed that Louis R. Ross , executive vice president , North American Automotive Operations , will succeed Mr. Gilmour as head of international operations . Alexander Trotman , now second-in-command to Mr. Ross , will succeed him . In its proxy statement , Ford is asking shareholders to approve a restricted stock plan for non-employee directors . The plan would grant each of these directors 1 , 000 shares of Ford common stock every five years , 200 of which would be distributed each year . Ford would hold their remaining shares , with these directors retaining dividends and voting rights . Ford said the plan should " increase the proprietary interest of non-employee directors in the company ' s success and . . . provide them with an additional incentive to continue as directors . " Eleven of Ford ' s 20 directors aren ' t company employees . The proxy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s 35. 4 million Class B shares are being held in a 10-year voting trust that requires trustee William Clay Ford to vote the shares according to " a plurality of the shares in the trust . " Class B shares are restricted almost exclusively to Ford family members and represent 40% of Ford ' s total voting power . The trust was established after the death of former Chairman Henry Ford II to maintain a unified family voice in corporate affairs . William Clay Ford , a former Ford vice chairman , is Henry Ford II ' s only surviving brother , a Ford director and chairman of the company ' s powerful finance and executive committees .
