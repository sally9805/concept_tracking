In Livonia , Mich. , engineers at Air-Flow Sciences , Corp . pored over pages of computer output and pondered coefficients of drag in an effort to advance the state of the art in bobsled design . In Seattle , high-tech types at the Flight Research Institute analyzed the body of a four-man bob with the help of Boeing 's computers . In each case the mission was to construct faster vehicles for U.S. sledders to use in Calgary . // Meanwhile , outside Syracuse , N.Y. , sculptor Jerome Malinowski painstakingly formed a model of a bobsled out of a big lump of clay . Eight months later , in October , that clay had been transformed into a sleek two-man sled that sat on the floor of Malinowski 's rural studio . He says , " The main thing was that it be beautiful . It should work , of course , but my main interest was to have a beautiful sled . " Malinowski , 48 , an art professor at Syracuse University , pauses and adds . " I think if something looks right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it look like a water mammal  --  a dolphin or killer whale . In terms of form , they 're very efficient . When I saw the sled take this shape . I figured it might go fast . And you know . I think it will . " // The U.S. bobsled team 's splintered search for the perfect sled suggests a question : Which approach is best , the scientific or the soulful ? No one seems to know . Previous can't-miss high-tech projects  --  such as the much ballyhooed Dodge sled of 1979 ( it crashed on a trial run at Lake Placid )  --  were , in Malinowski 's gentle assessment , " absolute catastrophes . " So why not water mammals ? Why not poetry in motion ? Why not Malinowski ? " That 's what I asked myself when I was watching the Sarajevo Olympics on TV. " he says . " I thought . Gosh . I can sculpt one of those , and I 'll bet I could make it go fast . " // This was n't mere presumption . Twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee-deep in coefficients of drag . " I do understand all that stuff . " he says . " In fact . I was fascinated by aerodynamics and efficiency . Of course , you were an oddball if you talked about efficiency back then . All they wanted was fins . " // So the artist left Ford 's fins for the Far East . " I spent two years in Japan , designing and learning . " he says . " It Changed my view . " After three years he returned to the U.S. and settled on a 220-acre farm in central New York State . He taught art by day and sculpted by night , often using clay or fiberglass as his medium . He was thinking of clay and fiberglass as he watched the bobsleds race on TV from Sarajevo , where the fastest U.S. sled finished fifth . // After the Olympics were over , Malinowski became obsessed with the idea of building a better bob . In 1986 he got together with Bob Manning , an adjunct professor of engineering at Syracuse who , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on bobsled design . Malinowski then asked his studio research class if anyone was interested in joining him in a sled project . Dan Retz , then a junior , signed on . " Looked like a good way to get a grade . " says Retz , They next brought their ideas to the U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton Federation in Lake Placid and were granted $3,500 in seed money . Malinowski 's garage-bob effort was under way . // Malinowski built a 12-inch model of the sled , then ordered 350 pounds of clay and with Retz went to work on a full-scale model . Last August , after some 320 man-hours of sculpting , the clay looked like a bobsled . From this they fashioned a polyester mold , a " buck " in sculpting terminology . When Retz climbed into the buck , he lent the bobsled life . Says Malinowski , " Till then it was just an idea . Now it was a thing ! " // But there was rough sledding ahead . New international safety standards mandated larger bumpers and rounder noses for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't used to this . " says Malinowski . " When you finish a sculpture , someone does n't say , ' Hey , this has to be different . Chop it off ! ' But what can you do ? So we built up the bumpers , which changed the whole line of the sled . The funny thing is , it looked even better  --  more beautiful , more like the water mammal . These regulators were artists , in their way . " // Using the buck , Malinowski and Retz made a shell of polyester , carbon fibers and Kevlar and attached the shell to the steel chassis of a sled that had crashed on the Lake Placid run . Then they took a step back and looked at their work . Sleek . Wavy . Smooth . It was , well , beautiful . // Ah , but was it fast ? // The U.S. federation had reserved the track at Winterberg , West Germany , for the U.S. Olympic trials in October . The sculpted water mammal was one of two dozen sleds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipped for testing , and Malinowski , more nervous than he had been at his first one-man show , accompanied his creation to the trials . His faith was rewarded . " Its times were right up there with the best sleds ' , " says Malinowski proudly . " And we did n't have Olympic crews either . " // That 's an understatement . Even Malinowski  --  all 6 ' 4 " and 220 pounds of him  --  squeezed into the brakeman 's position for a run . Donnie Hass , an experienced driver from Martville , N.Y. , also tried the sled . " I saw it and said , ' God , it 's beautiful . ' " says Hass . " Jerry appreciated that , you could tell . And what 's more , it 's fast and smooth . It 's faster than the Italian sleds I 've been using . When Jerry contours the bottom and customizes it for a particular driver . I think it 'll be the fastest sled on the U.S. team . " // In late December the bob left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carried away . He shed no tears . All his life he had seen artwork leave the studio . That 's the way it goes , in both sculpting and bobsled building . The Syracuse bob and two other sleds went to Innsbruck for testing , where the three U.S. Olympic team drivers  --  Brent Rushlaw , Matt Roy and Randy Will  --  would try them out . // The drivers will continue to test the sleds well into February , and the two drivers who qualify for Olympic competition can chose their sleds just before the two-man finals , Feb. 20 and 21 . The water mammal may slide in Calgary , or it may not . Whatever happens , Malinowski the artist is satisfied . He has created the most beautiful bobsled the world has ever seen .
