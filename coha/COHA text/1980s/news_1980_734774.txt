txt The international bond market was exhibiting signs of a split-perknality last week , with the primary market for new U.S. dollar-denominated issues declining and the secondary market for seasoned issues rising . This unusual condition resulted from aggressive bidding for new-issue mandates .. Yields at below market levels were proposed to prospective borrowers . When they accepted , it was difficult for the underwriters to sell the paper without offering big discounts . Indeed , some offerings were being quoted in premarket trading at discounts from issue price of between three and four points . However , prices of seasoned issues rose one to two points over the week , indicating that dealers and investors were keen on adding to their holdings , or at least covering their positions . " We are seeing a good tailwind in the market , " one trader said . The somewhat confusing market pattern was reflected in differing views about the outlook for interest rates . Some dealers and underwriters said they were looking for short-term interest rates soon to start moving lower . However , Alan Ornrod , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said that further tightening of credit conditions is needed because U.S. bank reserves have risen too rapidly . " The underlying trend in interest rates is now upward , " he said . Charles Geisst , an economist at Hill Samuel &; Co. , contended that seasonal demand for bank loans in November and December could exert further upward pressure on interest rates . He cautioned that purchases should be made only on weakness . " Shortterm bonds are attractive at yields of 13% or better ( a two to three point drop from current levels ) and long-term bonds at 13.38% or better ( two points down ) , " he said in his weekly bond comment . Emerging as the market 's most aggressive bidder of the week was Morgan Stanley International . It persuaded Citicorp to float notes in Europe instead of in New York by proposing terms that apparently were n't available domestically . In addition , Morgan Stanley scheduled another note Issue for General Motors Corp . at what appeared to be a lower yield that the U.S. Treasury could obtain in the home market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , priced at 99.5 bearing 12% annually to yield 12.11% at maturity on an annual coupon basis . On a semi-annual coupon basis used in the U.S. , the yield came to about 1L75% . General Motors raised $100 million with a seven-year note issue priced at 99.875 , bearing 11.75% , to yield 11.78% annually and 11.43% semi-annually . Morgan Stanley committed itself ahead of the selling period to float both issues on fixed terms . This can be risky because market conditions can deteriorate before the notes can be sold . However , an executive at Morgan Stanley in London said his firm was reacting to " a highly competitive situation . " He added that there is a good prospect for interest rates to ease in coming weeks so that demand for the notes should pick up .
