It seemed like a fine time . She was out of school , hanging out in Greenwich Village , and Charlie Parker was teaching her to sing . " Not that Charlie Parker , " Phoebe Snow says now , but still , this was a time of awakening . At the urging of Parker , her " first boyfriend , " Snow was beginning to experiment with the crystalline grace of her four-octave voice , getting a grip on her crippling shyness , actually starting to perform . She made a debut album , she had a hit , she was on her way . Then her luck faded . So did she . <P> That was the mid- ' 70s . There was music after that , but none of it was as consistent or as solid ; none of it was as soulful . Now Phoebe Snow is back , with her first album in eight years , whose title , Something Real , is a cool bit of understatement . The record is so real  --  so immediate  --  that the feelings described in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy and rock on request , but the tunes have lyrics so vivid that each becomes an epigram from a broken heart . <P> What gives the songs their staying power is their instant emotional familiarity , the way they seem to carry so much of Snow 's emotional freight with no strain . The record 's last song , Cardiac Arrest , is a kick , a stops-out rocker that dares to be a little goofy , that cuts the listener a little welcome slack . Even here , though , Snow is laughing at the expense of a mangled heart . The women Snow sings about put themselves at perpetual high risk . I 'm Your Girl , the record 's midpoint and one of its high points , sounds at first like another improbably beguiling Snow song about love gone bad . I 'm Your Girl is a love song , all right , but it is about Snow 's mother Lili , who died of cancer in 1986 . <P> Lili Grossman was a former Martha Graham dancer who married an entertainer turned exterminator and raised Phoebe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , N.J. Phoebe was a shy child . " If you remember , " she says , " in high school there were always a couple of kids whose clothes were on crooked , whose glasses were really thick and hung sideways . Their hair was never right , and their clothes did n't match , and they looked like little lost souls wandering down the hallway . That was me . " <P> It was the music she heard , and the music Parker urged her to make , that brought her out of herself . She was making demo tapes the night she heard that Parker had ODed . But he had left her a legacy : a little self-confidence . And some hard luck . Her first album , released in 1974 , is still treasured as one of the seminal singer-songwriter testaments of the decade . There were enervating legal problems over record deals . Her subsequent releases turned unfocused , uncertain . And there were personal tragedies . Snow 's daughter Valerie was born with brain damage in 1975 . Music was no longer so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a great struggle . Snow resolved to care for her daughter at home , but then almost died herself a few years back from a sickness she declines to specify . She now supports herself and Valerie mostly by singing advertising jingles.
