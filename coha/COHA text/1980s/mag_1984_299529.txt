There was a time when a Navy man talked like a sailor . He cooked in the galley and ate on the mess deck . If he got out of line he was thrown into the brig . But in the 1970s the Navy adopted the language of landlubbers . The galley became a kitchen ; the mess deck was termed the enlisted dining facility ; the brig was transformed into a correctional facility . Even the snappy BOQ , Bachelor Officers ' Quarters , gave way to unaccompanied officer personnel housing . <P> Secretary of the Navy John F Lehman Jr . has been waging a one-man war against what he terms " the bureaucratization of naval language . " Last week , in an effort to restore " our nautical lexicon , " he ordered all Navy facilities to return to traditional usages by Jan. 1 . No longer will passageways be halls or heads identified as toilets . Windows will once again be portholes , and ceilings will be overheads . Lehman , a naval aviator , also objects to recruiting pitches like " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines convey a " sense of apology " about the military . Says Lehman : " We 're throwing that sort of thinking into the dustbin. "
