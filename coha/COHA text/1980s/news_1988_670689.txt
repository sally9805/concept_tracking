They noted that Brazil ' s 9 , 100 miles of land borders , its 4 , 600 miles of coastline and its superior air and maritime connections could make it an ideal transshipment point for cocaine headed north from Colombia , Peru and Bolivia. // They even cautioned the Brazilian authorities , who , to the eyes of the Americans , seemed unconcerned , that their vast nation , only slightly smaller than the United States , could become a producer of coca leaf and a refiner of cocaine . They warned that Brazil might become entangled in the cycle of drug abuse and organized crime that has ensnared its neighbors to the west , notably Colombia and Bolivia . <> <> Important New Player // Today , at a pace that is alarming the local and foreign police , those dark forecasts are coming true . Brazil has emerged as the most important new player in the international narcotics trade , with a role in every stage of the drug chain , from production to consumption. // The American warnings went mostly unheeded , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smuggling without the resources , experience or political backing needed to take on an aggressive drug syndicate that has clearly seized the initiative. // " The situation is critical , really critical , " said Claudio Barrouin Mello , the chief of the narcotics division of the federal police in Rio de Janeiro . " I have only 18 agents here and we only have 300 in all of Brazil . Everything favors the traffickers . " <> <> U.S. Offers Aid // The United States has increased the money it contributes to anti-drug efforts in Brazil from $200 , 000 in 1985 to $2. 2 million this year . That financing has enabled the federal police , considered competent and honest by foreign specialists , to mount an operation this month to expand searches for narcotics at major airports. // Seizures of cocaine have risen from about 200 pounds in 1981 to 10 times that amount last year and to about 2 , 000 pounds in the first six months of this year . But a sense of despair is setting in as the dimension of the problem becomes clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big seizure , " Mr. Barrouin said . " Today , the shipments are of hundreds of kilos . And we only catch a tiny percentage of them. " // Already , in Rio de Janeiro , nar-cotics have become a political problem because of the power that armed drug gangs have over the sprawling hillside shantytowns known as " favelas , " which serve as local distribution points for cocaine . In June , the state Government ordered the police to raid Rocinha , the largest of the favelas , but many other poor sections are under the control of the drug gangs. // What most worries narcotics experts is the extraordinary difficulty in monitoring drug activities in a country this size . Brazil ' s 2 , 000-mile land border with Bolivia is about as long as the boundary between the United States and Mexico . The country , South America ' s largest , has borders of about 1 , 000 miles with Peru and 1 , 040 miles with Colombia , and it is also connected to those two countries by the Amazon River and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is Simply Flown in ' // " As long as Bolivia is a major producer , Mato Grosso will be an avenue , " said Antonio Martines Perez , the head of the federal police in Cuiaba , the capital of the western state of Mato Grosso , which borders on Bolivia . " Small amounts are brought over by ' mules ' through Puerto Suarez or San Matias , but most of the cocaine is simply flown in . " Mules are couriers who smuggle drugs overland . Puerto Suarez and San Matias are in southeastern Bolivia . A spokesman for the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration in New York , Robert Strang , said his agency would not comment on the changing trafficking patterns in South America . But one indication of the use of Brazil as a transshipment point for cocaine bound for the United States came in March 1987 , when the Federal and local authorities broke up a ring of airline workers who smuggled $1. 5 billion worth of cocaine into Kennedy International Airport aboard Pan American World Airways flights from Brazil . Narcotics experts said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazil in 1985 , when stepped-up enforcement efforts in Colombia and the United States led to the seizure of much cocaine smuggled through traditional routes in Florida . The United States is the major market for Latin drugs. // At the time , the traffickers also developed Central America and Mexico as important new routes , but Brazil offered the attraction of long , largely unpatrolled borders with 10 South American nations and a large export trade with the United States . American customs agents did not immediately associate Brazil with the drug trade . <> <> The European Connection // The mid-1980 ' s also saw the expansion of the cocaine market in Western Europe , and Brazil has better air and sea connections and greater trade with the Common Market nations than does any other Latin country . With the street price of cocaine three times higher in Amsterdam than in New York , for example , traffickers had an additional incentive for developing Brazil , with its European connections. // The smugglers began diverting more cocaine through Rio de Janeiro to parts of southern Brazil within reach of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by small aircraft from Bolivia or Paraguay , or hidden in cargo carried by ocean-going vessels that ply the Amazon River beyond the point where Brazil , Colombia and Peru meet . In June , four tons of cocaine were seized at Tampa , Fla. , packed inside cedar board that had been shipped along the Amazon. // With Colombian traffickers apparently still in control , processing laboratories were set up inside Brazil to take advantage of the easier access to chemicals , principally ether and acetone , used to turn coca paste into pure cocaine . The chemicals are manufactured in Brazil but not in the neighboring countries. // Major drug laboratories have already been found near Sao Paulo and near the Amazon port city of Manaus , but most processing centers are believed to be hidden in the jungle or on remote farms in the western states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul , near Bolivia. // " We ' ve found four big labs in the past year , " said Mr. Perez , the federal police chief . " But God knows how many more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colombian drug gangs are also reportedly responsible for the spread of coca plantations into a border area known as the Dog ' s Head , in northwestern Brazil . The coca leaf , known locally as " epadu , " is grown by Indians , who are paid by the traffickers , in a tiny jungle clearing far from civilization but close to a series of rivers connecting the two countries. // This month , with the aid of the United States , the federal police are carrying out their annual eradication effort . Five 10-man teams of drug agents take to the jungle , literally pulling out the coca plants by hand . Last year , the police said they destroyed five million plants near the Uaupes River . This year ' s effort is being pressed further north , along the Icana River. // " These are impossibly difficult operations because you ' re working in the middle of nowhere , " a foreign drug expert said . " You need to mobilize the navy and air force , and they ' re not always cooperative . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very easy . They pay the Indians with clothing , machetes and food , but risk nothing. " // Brazil is also awakening to the vast expansion of marijuana cultivation in northeastern Brazil , principally along the lush Sao Francisco River , which divides the states of Bahia and Pernambuco . A new aerial monitoring program supported by the United States has enabled the federal police to identify hundreds of islands where marijuana is being grown out of the view of river traffic . <> <> Spread of Cocaine // Marijuana has traditionally been the most popular drug in Brazil , and the new crops are thought to be destined for the major urban centers of the south . Paraguay had been the main supplier of marijuana to Brazil before local cultivation took hold. // Cocaine , although cheaper here than in the United States , has until recently been the province of the affluent . But the federal police say they fear that the nation will be flooded with coca paste , a smokeable substance that produces an instant high like that of crack . Smoking the paste is considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sulphuric acid and kerosene , which are used to process the drug and can cause brain damage. // The paste , known as " basuco " in Colombia , is widely used in Peru , Bolivia and Venezuela . It has caused severe drug-abuse problems and violence similar to that spawned by crack in some American cities . " Basuco is already a problem in Manaus , " Mr. Barrouin said , " and it has also been found in Mato Grosso. " // Brazil ' s increased concern about drug use is reflected in recent crackdowns on local narcotics rings , including one that was run by Antonio Nicolau , a major drug figure who reportedly controlled 60 percent of the cocaine distribution in Rio de Janeiro . Mr. Nicolau was killed in a raid in February , and 30 members of his gang were arrested in June . <> <> Crime on the Rise // Despite this success , the police recognize that drugs are fueling organized crime here . Cars stolen in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are often exchanged for cocaine in Bolivia and Paraguay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linked in one way or other to drugs , " Mr. Barrouin said . The city is facing a sharp rise in violent crime. // With Brazil ' s drug problems expected to grow , the federal police are lobbying the Government for more resources and a greater role for the armed forces in the anti-drug effort. // But many officers express frustration . " When I came here last year , I thought I could do something , " Mr. Perez said . " But all my budget goes on wages and rents . In practice , I have one inspector in charge of the anti-drug battle in a state larger than most countries. " //
