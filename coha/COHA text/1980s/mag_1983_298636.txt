The world 's fourth largest democracy re-elects its President <P> It was a proud day for Nigerians , the second presidential election since the country returned to civilian rule in 1979 . From the dense rain forests of the southern delta to the desert in the north , they turned out in record throngs by car , camel and canoe to vote at some 160,000 polling stations . Belying their reputation for volatility , Nigerians waited patiently in lines for up to eight hours to have their say in their country 's government . By the end of the day , 25.4 million voters had placed their thumbprints in indelible purple ink beside the symbol of one of the six parties participating in the race . <P> Five days later the last votes had been tallied and officials announced that President Shehu Shagari , 58 , had been overwhelmingly re-elected as leader of the world 's fourth largest democracy ( after India , the U.S. and Japan ) . Shagari , a soft-spoken Muslim who writes poetry in Hausa , the language of the north , won more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He satisfied a second requirement , designed to ensure broad national support , by garnering 25% of the vote in 16 of the country 's 19 states . <P> Nigerians were relieved that their young democracy had survived one of its most severe tests . When the military turned the country back to civilian rule in 1979 , few believed that the new government would be able to cope with the intense ethnic and tribal loyalties that had spawned the military takeovers of the past . Declared Shagari after his reelection : " It is a victory for all Nigerians ; it is a victory for democracy . " Nigeria , he said , would remain nonaligned but " very much " tied to the West . <P> Although election day was peaceful , nearly 100 people died in political violence during the six-month campaign . Shagari took a stern line on law and order . He did not allow the army to supervise polling stations , as it had done in 1979 , but troops were deployed at checkpoints in troubled areas . Still , there were charges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the predominantly agricultural and Muslim north . But he also picked up votes in regions populated by minority tribes . Shagari 's re-election effectively ended the political careers of his two main rivals : Chief Obafemi Awolowo , 74 , leader of the Unity Party , and Nnamdi Azikiwe , 78 , head of the Nigerian People 's Party . <P> Shagari 's main concern now is the parlous state of the Nigerian economy . When he was elected to his first term , Nigeria was booming as a result of high oil prices and expanding production . As oil prices dropped in 1981 and OPEC tightened its production quotas , Nigerian oil revenues , which normally account for 90% of the country 's export earnings , fell from $26 billion a year to $10 billion . The government is currently negotiating with the International Monetary Fund for a three-year loan that will help ease its balance of payments deficit .
