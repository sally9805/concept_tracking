Brian Boitano is working up speed as he approaches his takeoff point . His skates scratch lightly over the ice , making a sound that cuts through the still , cold air and echoes through the empty arena . He 's in Berkeley , Calif. , at the Iceland arena , where the interior walls are painted to look like a winter wonderland . It 's a nice effect , if weird , for the streets outside the arena are among the grimiest in the Bay Area . // A mist hangs over the ice . As Boitano slips through it , he 's thinking . Sit a little forward ; push light ; not too hyper on the turn . He transfers his weight from his left to his right skate and pivots so that he 's gliding backward . His face is calm . He sets the toe pick of his left skate into the ice and tells himself , Now explode ! // What happens next is nearly impossible to follow . Boitano launches himself skyward and immediately becomes a gyrating blur as he attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Boitano sees an explosion of ice that propels him into the air . He 's not concerned about the height of his jump , for he has the natural leap of a deer . Rather , he concentrates on staying centered , on making a quicker than normal rotation . If he is in trouble , as he is in this jump , he knows it early on . But that knowledge is of little use . Everything happens so quickly  --  onetwothreefour revolutions , faster than you can count  --  that there 's no chance for a saving adjustment . // Crunkkkk ! As he lands , Boitano 's right skate blade digs deeply into the ice , and he pitches forward as if tackled . It 's a violent fall . His coach , Linda Leaver , watches impassively . She has been his coach for 16 years , since he was eight years old . He 's the godfather of her youngest daughter , Lindsay . When Boitano retires , Leaver will retire also , for she wants to spend more time with her family . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Brian Boitano , it 's hard to settle for less  --  less of a skater and less of a friend . // After a while , Leaver asks , " How did that feel ? " She 's referring not to the fall but to his approach , in which they 've made a minor adjustment . " Better , " says Boitano , catching his breath . " I think I was too far forward . " // " That 's what it looked like . " // Neither Boitano nor Leaver seems convinced . Maybe he was too far forward , maybe not . " Sometimes you just do n't know what you did differently from one jump to the next , " Boitano says later , assessing the failed leap . " You wonder . Why am I falling today ? " // He falls because he skates out on the edge . With the 1988 Winter Olympics just around the corner , Boitano , four-time U.S. champion and the 1986 world champ , is still testing his personal limits and the limits of his sport , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's still growing as a man and a skater . // " Technically , Brian 's the best there 's ever been . I do n't think there 's any question about that , " says Sandra Bezic , Boitano 's choreographer and a five-time Canadian pairs champion . " He 's powerful , and his position in the air is perfect . He 's technically exact . " // A technical robot , Boitano used to call himself , as consistent as he was athletic . In 1982 , when he was 18 , he became the first skater to land a triple Axel in the nationals  --  3 revolutions in the air . In ' 83 , during his debut in the world championships , he became the first skater in the world to land all six triple jumps in that competition  --  Salchow , Lutz , Axel , toe loop , loop and flip . By way of comparison , Scott Hamilton , in winning the Olympic gold medal in Sarajevo in ' 84 , performed only three of those triples , and the ' 87 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done a triple loop in competition until last September . " Not taking anything away from Brian Orser  --  he 's quick and catlike , and his leg thrusts on his Axels are spectacular , " says Leaver . " But technically there 's no comparison between him and Brian . " // Leaver 's view  --  a biased one , to be sure  --  is shared by most of the skating community . On the athletic side , Boitano is the dominant male skating today . In addition to the six triples he has in his repertoire , he has also created something he jokingly calls the ' Tano Triple , in which he performs a triple Lutz with one arm over his head and the other arm cradled in front of him , as if holding an invisible partner . Visually , the move is engaging , but having one 's arms away from one 's body has the aerodynamic effect of slowing down rotation . To make up for that , Boitano must reach a staggering height . " No one else in the world can do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see anyone else even try it . " // But there 's more to skating than athletics , as was reinforced last March in Cincinnati when Orser took the world championship away from Boitano , who fell while attempting his much ballyhooed quadruple toe loop . " Failing to land the quad was n't what cost him the title , " says Bezic . " He 's told me a number of times he was n't hungry enough to win . It was like he wanted to skip a year and go right to 1988. " // " It was n't that important to me , " Boitano agrees . " I really believe I made myself not win in Cincinnati . " // That 's the fatalist in Boitano talking . He does n't believe in randomness . And whether it was the ghost of Hans Brinker , benign fate or some inner voice in Boitano  --  a voice he calls Murphy  --  that orchestrated his defeat in the world championships , the end result has been that Boitano is a better skater for it . // Someone or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could he ever have been drawn into this crazy sport ? No one in his family skated . None of his friends did . As the youngest  --  by seven years  --  of four siblings , Boitano spent a lot of time by himself as a child . He roller-skated on the sidewalks in front of his home in Sunnyvale , Calif . One of his favorite games was to pretend he was invisible . And he liked baseball , which his father , Lew , had played at the semipro level for the San Jose Bees before starting a career in banking . // When Brian was eight , the Ice Follies came to San Francisco , and his parents took him to see it . The moment he remembers best was when a woman in an Arabian costume was carried around on a giant pillow looking like something out of TV 's I Dream of Jeannie . ( The woman was Uschi Keszler , who is now Orser 's choreographer  --  another twist of fate as far as Boitano is concerned . ) Before long he had badgered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher was Leaver , who worked out of the Sunnyvale Ice Palace . // Leaver had many students back then  --  she now has only two . Boitano and Yvonne Gomez , the Spanish national champion who will also skate at Calgary  --  but she immediately saw something special in Brian , " I thought he 'd be great right away , " she says . " I used to keep charts on every student , with my predictions and expectations for them . Though Brian was only eight , I went home and told my husband that one day he 'd be the world champion . " // Boitano 's idol was Terry Kubicka , the U.S. champion in 1976 , who holds the distinction of being the first and last skater to do a backflip in the Olympics , which he performed at Innsbruck in 1976 . ( The backflip was soon banned as too dangerous by the International Skating Union . ) " Like most boys . Brian was never very interested in the artistic side , " says Leaver . " How you point your toe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumping high and doing more turns than everybody else . " // Thus was born the technical robot , a perfectionist who never missed a jump but who also never put very much of his inner self on display . He impressed the judges but left them unmoved . " He 's always been a private person , " says Leaver . " But every year I 've known him he 's changed and grown . He 's more ready now to express what 's inside him through his skating . " // That has been a big step for Boitano . Figure skating is as subjective a sport as there is , and to bare one 's soul before an international panel of sour-looking judges  --  not to mention a packed arena  --  takes equal parts moxie and ham . Boitano is not a showman by nature . He excelled in this sport , even won a world championship , on the technical brilliance of his skating and his ability to perform under pressure . Those qualities masked his artistic shortcomings . // Ironically , had he mastered the quad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skater . The quad represents the new , and perhaps last , technical frontier for skaters , and Boitano wanted to be the first to land it cleanly in competition . He nearly did so at the ' 87 nationals in Tacoma , Wash. , last February , completing the four revolutions of the toe loop but touching down with his hand as he landed . He would try it again at the worlds . // The quad , by that time , had taken on a life of its own . It was bigger , almost , than the competition itself . Boitano was asked about it incessantly , was second-guessed for including it in such an important competition and was sniped at by some of his rivals for building his program around a single gimmicky jump . While warming up for the long-program part of the competition , which he needed to win to retain his title , Boitano nailed a quad perfectly . " It was the best one I 'd ever done in front of an audience , " Boitano recalls , " and I was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , started saying , You proved to yourself you could do it . Good going . Then another voice inside me said , Keep fighting . You have to do it in the actual competition . Oh , relax , Murphy would say . I thought , Shut up , Murphy . You 're not doing me any good . ' // But maybe Murphy knew best . Boitano fell when he attempted the quad during his long program , and while that miscue by itself did n't cost him the title , it did cost him some confidence . He lost his aggressiveness in the last two minutes of his program , pulled out of a couple of moves and lost the championship to Orser. // " Ever since he first skated , every time Brian 's lost something he could have won , he 's made a major change in direction , " says Leaver . Boitano had considered working with choreographer Bezic in the past but had n't followed up on the idea for one reason or another . Now he was ready . Leaver contacted Bezic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I did n't know how much I could do for him , " Bezic says . " Artistically , a lot of people thought that Brian Orser was superior to him and that my Brian just might not have it . I was worried about that myself . But he does have it . He just needed some direction . " // When Boitano was choosing his own music , he skated to upbeat rock-'n ' - roll tunes or western fiddle music . In his long program he performed the role of a skating cowboy  --  lots of hat-tipping and handclapping and smiles . " I was trying to be a big Brian Orser , " he says now . " I thought I had to do that . " // Orser is small , almost tiny , at 5 ' 4 " , 135 pounds . Hamilton , the 1984 Olympic champ , is similarly built . So is the top Soviet skater , Alexander Fadeev . Boitano , by contrast , is a veritable giant in his field at 5 ' 11 " , 158 pounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compact bodies and those quick , little legs , " he says . " But Sandra wanted to bring out the qualities that suit me best , which are line and strength . Those other skaters ca n't be line skaters performers who use the natural lines of their body to create a pleasing design . We 're just going to make a great line and let the judges decide which look they like better . " // Out went the rock ' n ' roll . Out went the fiddles . " He 's powerful  --  his jumps are incredible  --  and I wanted to showcase simplicity instead of shtick , " says Bezic. // For Boitano 's short program Bezic chose a ballet , Les Patineurs ( " The Skaters " ) , that 's about a 19th-century boy who struts his stuff on a frozen pond while the townspeople watch in awe . The young skater is arrogant  --  and good . Boitano , while practicing the program , lands a triple Axel-double loop combination and then wipes the snow off his skate blade , throwing it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ! " Bezic tells Boitano , encouraging him to look as cocksure as possible . Strangely , that attitude on him is attractive , while on another skater it might look obnoxious . " To me , Brian is the result of a hundred years of skating , and we wanted to combine his technical ability with the classic look of just skating on a pond , " says Bezic . " It works because he 's not arrogant . He 's such a together and disciplined person that what comes across is strength . " // Boitano skates with much the same demeanor in his new long program , in which he plays a military character , to music composed for the film Napoleon . He battles and parades , dances and courts , broods and exults in victory . In the process , Boitano showcases his array of technical skills , which will include the quad in the 1988 world championships in Budapest , but not the Olympics . Leaver believes he can win the gold medal in Calgary without it and feels there is too much at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the quad is n't the centerpiece of the performance . Boitano is . He 's riveting . // " He 's always felt a little vulnerable on the ice , " says Bezic . " With these two programs , either as the military man or the arrogant boy , he can hide behind a character . It gives him a mask . That helps when you 're putting your heart and soul on the ice . It 's like being bare-naked out there during a performance . " // Now the artist and athlete have come together , perhaps for the first time . In January at the nationals , Boitano 's short program brought the crowd to its feet and earned perfect marks for composition and style from eight of the nine judges . " I 've never had such positive feedback , " he says . " People treat me as if a lightning bolt came down and hit me , as if Sandra performed some sort of miracle . But I do n't believe it . What they 're seeing was always inside me , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . It 's me out there . " What they 're seeing is an athlete in his prime . // It 's 1:30 p.m . Boitano has been training since 7:45  --  three hours of practicing figures , a few minutes ' rest while the ice was resurfaced and then two more hours of freestyle skating . He 's an uncomplaining worker , for he has n't , even after all these years , lost his love of skating . // The mist has lifted off the ice , and Boitano 's blades are making short , quick , snicking noises as he picks up speed to attempt another quad . As he approaches the takeoff point , he thinks once more , Sit a little forward : push light ; not too hyper on the turn . He pivots backward , coasting , his legs flexed . Then he sets his toe pick and explodes ! // You still ca n't follow the spin . Up and out he soars , an airborne top , some sort of impossible human gyroscope on skates . As he blurs before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quintuple toe loop : they will run a two-minute mile before a man can spin faster than this while in flight . And then  --  crunkkkk !  --  the moment is past . His blade hits , and he turns . He has nailed it . A perfectly executed quad . Leaver watches , a smile creasing her face , as Boitano makes a couple of perfunctory moves and then coasts past , hands on his hips , catching his breath . What was different about that one ? he wonders .
