" // He told of climbing through an opening and getting up on the side of the sinking vessel , where two other passengers were clinging for their lives . Then he broke down and wept when asked about his son . <> <> Spotted by Freighter Crew // Crewmen in a passing Brazilian freighter - the Itape , out of Rio de Janeiro - were on their way from New York to Norfolk when they saw the stricken boat and radioed the Coast Guard. // " That ship was what kept me from becoming a basket case , " said Robert J. Radel , 38 , of Suffern , N.Y. " That ' s what gave me hope .

Mr. Kett said that he removed a length of nylon rope from the propeller and that Captain Housley later told him that this had corrected the problem. // He said the captain was meticulous in his care of his boat : " He was very particular about his boat . It was the center of his whole life. " // The hearing room in the Coast Guard building at the Battery was crowded with spectators , including the captains of fishing boats that sail out of Point Pleasant and other shore points. // D. Robert Nash , the captain of the 114-foot S/S Miss Belmar , said he had been out fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the boat ' s captain during the morning. // " It was sloppy but not unsafe sloppy , " Captain Nash said. //
