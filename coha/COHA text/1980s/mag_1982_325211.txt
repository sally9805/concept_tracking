Worried Arab rulers want U.S. help , but not if it is too obvious <P> The area surrounding the Persian Gulf is vital to the industrialized democracies of the world . More than 20% of the U.S. 's oil imports , 56% of Western Europe 's and 68% of Japan 's come from the gulf . That lifeline is acutely vulnerable to the disruptions of war , revolution and political turmoil . The region has been beset by all three . The conservative Arab states-Kuwait , Saudi Arabia , Qatar , Bahrain , the United Arab Emirates and Oman-face threats to their security at every point of the compass : a simmering , potentially explosive war between Iran and Iraq , armored Soviet divisions in Afghanistan , Soviet proxy forces in South Yemen , and the growing militancy of Islamic fundamentalists everywhere . <P> The gulf states know that only the U.S. has the power to deter major acts of aggression . But the U.S. is also the chief backer of Israel , and as such , it is the object of as much resentment as reliance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Begin 's determination to annex the West Bank is at least as likely to plunge the region into chaos as are the combined threats of Arab radicalism , Islamic fundamentalism and Soviet adventurism . In that respect , they see the U.S. as part of their problem rather than part of the solution . Therefore the dilemma : even the most pro-Western leaders in the region have been reluctant to cooperate closely and openly with American policies that are intended to bolster their own security . <P> To help defend the gulf , the U.S. has organized the Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force ( R.D.F. ) . Established in 1980 after the Iranian revolution and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , the R.D.F. draws on units from the Army , Air Force , Navy and Marines . Its mandate is " to ensure the unimpeded flow of oil " and " to deter aggression from outside Southwest Asia and the gulf and to assist nations in the region in resisting aggression . " The R.D.F. has headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa and until now has inhabited a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commands of the U.S. military . But as of Jan. 1 the organization will have a " separate unified " command . <P> That is fine with the nations it is supposed to protect as long as the R.D.F. remains out of sight , but not out of mind . When the U.S. tries to mount training exercises in the area , it encounters political and diplomatic obstacles almost as daunting as the logistical challenge of airlifting halfway around the world the Seventh Marine Amphibious Brigade , which is stationed at Twenty-nine Palms , Calif.
