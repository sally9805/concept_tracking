WASHINGTON  --  Congress is moving toward adopting a new Gramm-Rudman plan that would cut federal spending across the board if its own deficit-reduction package is rejected by President Reagan . The plan , which would include provisions to enforce a new deficit target for fiscal 1988 , would be attached , perhaps as early as next week , to a bill extending the federal borrowing limit . The Senate and House versions of the provision could vary , but both would present President Reagan with a difficult choice : accept a tax increase that the Democratic-controlled Congress is seeking or permit across-the-board spending reductions , which would make especially deep cuts in the president ' s prized military budget . Senate leaders from both parties said yesterday they intend to amend a short-term debt ceiling extension with a provision to strengthen enforcement of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law . The current $2. 32 trillion borrowing limit is scheduled to expire at the end of next week , and the government is expected to run out of funds by the end of the month unless Congress raises the limit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate Budget Committee and the panel ' s senior Republican , Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico , emerged from a meeting yesterday saying they were optimistic about agreeing on a bipartisan amendment . Among other things , the provision would reduce the amount of budget-cutting mandated by Gramm-Rudman . The current law requires that the deficit for fiscal 1988 , which begins Oct. 1 , be trimmed to $108 billion from the projected deficit of more than $170 billion . The senators are moving toward requiring a $36 billion reduction in the projected deficit rather than setting a target for the deficit itself . The $36 billion roughly matches the amount of deficit reduction contained in the budget plan already passed by Congress and being incorporated into specific legislation . In the Democratic-controlled House , a similar easing of the Gramm-Rudman target is being considered seriously . Democratic leaders there intend to attach their own version of the Gramm-Rudman law to a short-term extension of the borrowing limit . But the leading plan in the House would give the president discretion over whether to carry out across-the-board cuts ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both chambers agreed that a bolstering of the Gramm-Rudman law was all but essential to pass the debt-ceiling extension . The current Gramm-Rudman law has been toothless since its enforcement mechanism was declared unconstitutional last year , and the president promised he would support repairing that mechanism as part of the debt-ceiling increase . A large bloc of lawmakers also is demanding a repair in exchange for their vote to allow the government to take on more debt . The Gramm-Rudman law is seen by most legislators as a tool to force compromise between the Democratic-controlled Congress and the Republican president on the thorny budget issue . So far this year the two sides have gone in distinctly divergent directions in their budget priorities : Congress is seeking more taxes and less military spending than the president has requested . " I ' m trying to see if we can get some doors open , " Sen. Domenici said . The Gramm-Rudman amendment , he asserted , " will indeed pressure the Congress and the president to make significant changes .
