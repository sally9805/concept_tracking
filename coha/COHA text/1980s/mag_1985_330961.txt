In the four years since it was launched , People Express has brought no-frills flights to 49 cities . Yet even though it now has routes to London and California , the Newark-based company is still primarily an east-of-the- Mississippi phenomenon . Last week People took a giant step toward becoming a national airline by outbidding Texas Air to buy Denver 's Frontier Airlines for about $300 million . <P> Only two weeks ago , it looked as if Frontier would have a quite different fate . Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo had offered to buy 60% of the outstanding stock of Frontier Holdings , the airline 's parent company , for $20 a share , topping a $17-a-share bid made by four of Frontier 's five unions . Frontier 's employees , though , were anxious to avoid dealing with Lorenzo , whom they consider anti-union . In 1981 , he bought Continental Airlines and two years later declared bankruptcy in order to get out of costly union contracts . In August , TWA 's unions joined forces with Corporate Raider Carl Icahn to block Lorenzo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , president of Frontier 's flight attendants union : " We had directives from the membership that Lorenzo was not acceptable . " The unions , which had given $32 million in wage concessions while trying to take over Frontier , said they would revoke the salary cuts if Lorenzo took over . <P> A hectic series of negotiations between People and Frontier began when People Founder Donald Burr called Joseph O'Gorman , Frontier 's president , about a deal . While on vacation in Monterey , Calif. , Burr met with O'Gorman for two days . The talks then shifted to Denver 's United Bank Tower and finally to New York 's Chase Plaza . After receiving labor 's blessing , Frontier 's management opted for Burr 's $24-a-share offer . <P> The People-Texas Air battle brought back together two old rivals . Burr was a protege of Lorenzo 's at Texas Air in the 1970s but left on bad terms . Though they still dislike each other , Burr and Lorenzo share certain traits , including an antipathy for organized labor . Wall Street analysts were dumbfounded that Frontier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People , after all , is a non-union shop . Says one airline consultant : " Don Burr is as surprised as anyone else that Frontier struck a deal with People . " <P> Questions remain about Frontier 's future . The purchase agreement guarantees that no employees will be laid off for a minimum of five years , but People 's management is known for its low-budget operations . It flies passengers for 5.17 cents a mile , about half the industry average . People will surely look for ways to cut overhead , and that could include labor costs . <P> Linking People 's routes with Frontier 's should make for a good mix . People flies mostly to East Coast cities , while Frontier 's routes are concentrated in the West . In addition , Frontier 's 21 landing gates at Denver 's bustling Stapleton Airport are a valuable prize for People . Says Ruth Hennefeld , an investment manager at Merrill Lynch : " The deal is a bargain for People . The company bought into the Denver market for far less than it would have cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lofty goal of becoming a national airline now seems remarkably down to earth .
