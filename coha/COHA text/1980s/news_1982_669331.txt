But the accuracy of that forecast , say S &; L executives , analysts , and other observers of this industry that has been the backbone of the US personal savings and home mortgage system , hangs on two very big ' ' ifs ' ' : // // * If the current trend of declining short-term interest rates continues or rates stabilize at present levels. // // * If S &; Ls can profitably compete in what is becoming an almost totally deregulated environment , and without paying too much interest on two new accounts they are being allowed to offer . Some S &; Ls will pay more then they can afford ; others will choose not to compete in the high-stakes game that includes banks and giant financial-services companies , and will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage. // ' ' The short answer is , yes , the S &; Ls will turn around ' ' next year , said James Christian , chief economist at the US League of Savings Associations . ' ' But that ' s predicated on maintenance of current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I see 1983 as a transition year , with recovery coming over a two-year time period , ' ' said Jonathan Gray , an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &; Co. , a brokerage firm . ' ' Next year will be the industry ' s first profitable year in two years , but its return on assets will still be subpar . In 1984 , the industry will begin to see the historical rates of return it enjoyed in the late 1970s. ' ' // Part of the reason 1984 looks brighter than 1983 , he said , is a ' ' huge ' ' amount of deposits in 21/2-year ' ' small saver ' ' certificates made in the second half of 1981 . S &; Ls offered about 15 percent interest on these certificates , but they will not come due until the first half of 1984. // On the asset side of the ledger , Mr. Gray noted , the industry has done a good job of getting out from under at least some of the old low-interest mortgages that were bringing in several percentage points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for deposits such as savings certificates . Some of these mortgages have been ' ' sold ' ' on the secondary market to private investors , while others have been renegotiated. // In the future , he added , few S &; Ls will be willing to write a 30-year fixed mortgage , unless they can find a way to avoid carrying them on their books , perhaps by selling them on the secondary market . Most institutions will insist on some sort of variable-rate mortgage , even though this will leave them with a smaller share of that market. // ' ' With the new accounts , lower rates , and the dramatic cost-cutting steps most S &; Ls have taken over the last year , we are positioned to have a far better year in 1983 , ' ' said Robert H. Steele , chairman and president of the Dry Dock Savings Bank in New York . ' ' There will be no comparison between ' 82 and ' 83. ' ' // Those new accounts , approved in recent weeks by the Depository Institutions Deregulation Committee ( DIDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever interest they can afford on federally insured deposits of at least $2 , 500 . One of the accounts has limited check-writing and transfer privileges . It became available last Tuesday . The other one , to be available Jan. 5 , will permit unlimited checking . Both are insured for up to $100 , 000. // The S &; Ls are ' ' particularly well situated ' ' to gain an improved market share of deposits through the new acounts , Salomon Brothers partner Henry Kaufman told a recent convention of the US League . However , he added , because of the great competition for savings that has developed in recent years , S &; Ls ' ' should not expect to dominate the market for savings anytime soon. ' ' // Some savings institutions , however , may not be so well situated to handle the new accounts . These are the ones that still have a high proportion of their deposits in low-interest passbook savings accounts . While savings-and-loan institutions have about 19 percent of their retail deposits in these accounts , the figure is 32 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US League says . These banks , which are prevalent in the Northeast , could see the costs of their ' ' core deposits ' ' rise substantially if many customers switched to the new , DIDC-approved accounts. // In the long run , observers say , how S &; Ls handle these accounts and the other new powers they have been given recently will help determine what kind of S &; L industry there is in the future. // ' ' We ' re entering 1983 with a whole range of opportunities to choose from as we decide what we want to be when we grow up , ' ' observed Paul Wood , executive vice-president of the Arlington Helghts ( Ill . ) Federal Savings &; Loan Association. // Instead of just being a repository for passbook accounts and savings certificates , and a dispenser of home , auto , and personal loans , the ' ' grown up ' ' S &; L industry will have to compete with large commercial banks and emerging financial-services companies like Merrill Lynch &; Co . , Shearson/American Express , Sears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even a grocery chain like Kroger . These companies are expanding from their traditional businesses to match many of the services and , in some cases , the accessibility of banks and S &; Ls. // In addition to accounts designed to help the industry compete with money market funds , the banking bill Congress passed last summer also opened the way for S &; Ls to move into commercial lending , allowing them to use up to 5 percent of their assets for commercial loans in 1983 and 10 percent in 1984 and subsequent years . For a few years at least , most S &; Ls are not expected to try reaching those levels. // ' ' It ' s a rare S &; L that has the experience to move into that area too quickly , ' ' Mr. Wood of Arlington Heights S &; L said. // Many of the S &; Ls that do enter the commercial market are expected to stick to familiar areas , making loans to real estate developers , home builders , and contractors. // Despite the brighter outlook , experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in more S &; Ls being forced out of business or into mergers , a development that may be good for consumers. // ' ' There most definitely will be a contraction , ' ' said Charlene Sullivan , a professor of management at Purdue University . ' ' But that will be in the interest of the consumer . Serving the consumer today is expensive , and there are economies of scale in the financial services industry that a larger institution can best serve. // ' ' There ' s no way the consumer could be worse off in this kind of environment. ' ' // Still , she said , if they want to survive without a merger , many of the smaller S &; Ls will have to continue working out arrangements with other institutions to share services like marketing , data processing , and automatic teller machines. // But industry-watchers agree that these long-range goals are all less important than the immediate concern over interest rates . Many S &; L executives seem to be holding their breath , hoping they can get through the next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the interest they must offer on deposits. // ' ' If we have another explosion in interest rates , all bets are off , ' ' Dr. Christian said . **22;9885; <> **44;9909; **42;9955; <> **76;9999; **48;10077; Where America keeps its money <> <> **76;10127; **48;10205; ( Billions of dollars , as of September ) <> <> **76;10255; <> Traditional banking <> <> **76;10333; <> Checking accounts <> **26;10411; $232. 6 <> <> **76;10439; <> NOW accounts <> **26;10517; 93. 0 <> <> **76;10545; <> Time deposits under $100 , 000 <> <> **76;10623; <> ( except savings certificates , <> <> **76;10701; <> IRAs , Keoghs , and retail repos ) <> **26;10779; 147. 1 <> <> **76;10807; <> Savings accounts <> **26;10885; 342. 5 <> <> **76;10913; <> Subtotal <> **26;10991; $815. 2 <> <> **76;11019; <> Retail money market <> <> **76;11097; <> 91-day certificates <> **26;11175; $10. 2 <> <> **76;11203; <> 6-month money market certificates <> **26;11281; 450. 3 <> <> **76;11309; <> 2 1/2-year small savers certificates <> **26;11387; 240. 4 <> <> **76;11415; <> All-Savers certificates <> **26;11493; 52. 9 <> <> **76;11521; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **76;11627; <> Unit investment trusts <> **26;11705; 1. 3 <> <> **76;11733; <> IRA/Keogh plan deposits <> **26;11811; 22. 3 <> <> **76;11839; <> Retail repurchase agreements <> **26;11917; 9. 4 <> <> **76;11945; <> 3- and 6-month T-bills <> <> **76;12023; <> ( noncompetitive bids ) <> **26;12101; 34. 1 <> <> **76;12129; <> Savings Bonds <> **26;12207; 67. 8 <> <> **76;12235; <> Subtotal <> **26;12313; $1 , 109. 2 <> <> **76;12341; <> Wholesale money market <> <> **76;12419; <> 3- and 6-month T-bills <> <> **76;12497; <> ( competitive bids ) <> **26;12575; $165. 3 <> <> **76;12603; <> Overnight repurchase agreements <> **26;12681; 36. 6 <> <> **76;12709; <> Certificates of deposit <> <> **76;12787; <> ( over$100 , 000 ) <> **26;12865; 40. 8 <> <> **76;12893; <> Bankers acceptances <> **26;12971; 40. 8 <> <> **76;12999; <> Commercial paper <> **26;13077; 118. 7 <> <> **76;13105; <> Eurodollar CDs <> **26;13183; 83. 1 <> <> **76;13211; <> Subtotal <> **26;13289; $783. 6 <> <> **76;13317; <> Grand total <> **26;13395; $2 , 708. 0 <> <> <> <> <> 1 Data as of July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // //
