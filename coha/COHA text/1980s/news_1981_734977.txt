txt For Ronald Reagan , Alexander Haig , George Bush , me , and assorted other political , media , and academic types , May means the annual challenge : what to say in a college commencement address . It 's a tricky exercise in rhetoric  --  most . useful , perhaps , for taping and using as a substitute for sleeping pills . Even the President making a first public address since surviving an assassination attempt could scarcely win one for the Gipper in this format . So , to save some high-priced speechwritera ' time , we 've developed a. handy-dandy , all-purpose , all-weather , dehydrated commencement address . All a speaker has to do is add adjectives , pick from a choice of cliches , stir , and serve . It 's non-fattening , biodegradable , can be kept on the shelf indefinitely without refrigeration , and is guaranteed to . have no environmental impact . ( Distinguished , lucky , scruffy-looking , spoiled ) graduates : As you prepare to go forth from this ( beautiful , over-priced , scruffy-looking , nearly bankrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will face many ( stimulating , paralyzing , nasty , boring ) challenges .

The Reagan administration is ( turning things around , only interested in helping the rich , a joke , going to get us blown up in a nuclear war ) . Inflation , unemployment , lagging productivity , competition from imports , and illegal immigration are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smarter than we think , you bum-out on the beach , the world does blow up , you stay in graduate school ) . Your generation will have to find new sources of energy by ( drilling more oil wells , developing solar batteries , relying on the wind , getting Jane Fonda to keep protest groups away from nuclear power plants ) . ? And you will have to conserve energy wherever you can by ( driving less , buying a. motorcyle , turning out the lights , showering with friends , flaking out on the beach ) . The Social Security system is in dire difficulty . Your generation is being recruited to contribute financially to the bottom line of a giant pyramid game that will probably go bust before you reach the payoff spot . You and your age cohorts should consider ( paying up and shutting up so you wo n't have to support your aging parents , going on wel- fare , flaking out on the beach , getting a federal government job , staying in graduat% school ) . Abroad , our relationships with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( us blown up because we do n't have th ( a MX , them building new weapons systemq. because we do have the MX , both them anct. us being blown up because we both hav0 new weapons ) . The problems are complicated by ( aging Soviet leadership , dot Reagan administration 's attitude , Cuba , Afghanistan , Poland , Haig , the CIA , the KGB , grain , vodka , ballet dancers ) . What'advice should you take with you into the adult world beyond this college ? Work ( harder than your colleagues , only if you ca n't avoid it , for yourself if you can , not until you 've stayed in graduate school as . &.; long as possible ) . Never stop learning orb reading ( the newspapers , the classics , pro. , fessional journals , stock market tables , " People , " " Doonesbury , " " TV Guide " ) .
