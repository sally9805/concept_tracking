When 1985 state legislatures convene , most of them next month , at least 1 , 087 women senators and representatives will be on hand . That ' s a gain of 96 over 1984. // Vermont ' s first woman governor , Democrat Madeleine Kunin , joins Kentucky Democrat Martha Layne Collins among the 50 state chief executives. // The ranks of women lieutenant governors will grow from three to five , with the November election of Democrats Harriett Woods in Missouri and Ruth Meiers in North Dakota . The three current lieutenant governors are Nancy Dick of Colorado , Martha Griffiths of Michigan , and Marlene Johnson of Minnesota . All three are Democrats. // All of the state legislatures , from Maine to Hawaii , will remain male-dominated . But women are expected to become a more powerful force in many of them. // In Oregon , State . Rep. Vera Katz , a Portland Democrat , has been chosen by her peers as speaker of the state ' s house of representatives , the first woman to hold that post. // The New Hampshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past two years , by Republican Vesta Roy of Salem. // Besides being a powerful legislative post , the presidency of the Granite State Senate is significant because the state has no lieutenant governor , and the Senate leader automatically becomes governor if the executive chair becomes vacant. // Other women legislators in various states will hold key posts such as majority or minority floor leaders and heads of committees . Democratic State Rep. Mary Chambers , for example , will be her party ' s floor leader in the 400-member New Hampshire House. // Women legislators across the United States do not have a common agenda , but they do have common interests , including the ' ' comparable worth ' ' pay issue , child abuse , family violence , improved health funding for day care , and better health care. // Speaker-elect Katz of the Oregon House , who won her seventh consecutive term Nov. 6 and was elected to the speakership on the 101st ballot at a caucus of Democratic state representatives , says one of her top priorities will be to work with colleagues to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' // Texas state Sen.-elect Cyndi Taylor Krier , a San Antonio Republican , will be the only member of her sex in the Lone Star State ' s upper legislative chamber . She says she wants to be ' ' known as an effective state senator , and not merely as the only woman in the Senate. ' ' // The GOP conservative , who was an aide to former Texas US Sen. John Tower , suggests that ' ' women have a lot of talent to contribute and have a responsibility to run for and hold office alongside men. ' ' // Similar views are voiced by second-term New Hampshire state Sen. Susan McLane , a board member of the national Women ' s Campaign Fund ( WCF ) . The Concord Republican notes that since 1969 , when she was first elected to her state ' s House of Representatives , the number of women state legislators in the nation has more than tripled. // ' ' Even with such gains , there is a long way to go before there is parity between the two sexes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 85 percent of state lawmakers are men. // Rosalie Whalen , executive director of the National Women ' s Education Fund , noting that well over half the 1 , 756 women who ran for state lawmaking seats on this year ' s ballot were elected , emphasizes that such successes are especially significant . ' ' It means putting more women on the political ladder , where valuable experience can be gained. ' ' // Most of those women who win higher offices , such as seats in Congress , have come out of state legislatures , she observes // Stephanie Solien , executive director of the WCF , foresees the current trend continuing as more and more women ' ' come to recognize that political office is not something beyond them and they can have a very positive role in government. ' ' // Similarly encouraged by the latest gains in legislative woman-power is Judy Goldsmith , president of the National Organization for Women , who views it as ensuring greater visibility and ' ' more attention to issues of particular importance to women . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she contends , has contributed to the election of more women state lawmakers. // Efforts to elect more women to Congress , Ms. Goldsmith notes , have been considerably less successful than those involving seats in state legislatures. // This year 10 women candidates sought election to the US Senate , once referred to as the most exclusive men ' s club in America . Only one , incumbent Republican Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas , was successful . Since the 100 senators have the luxury of six-year terms , the opportunities for breaking into the ' ' club ' ' are much more narrow than in the 435-member House , where each representative has to go back to the hustings every two years. // Although the Democratic Party this year became the first major party to have a woman on its national ticket , with the nomination of US Rep. Geraldine A. Ferraro of New York for vice-president , neither party seems to have a corner on attracting and electing women to public office. // Both the nation ' s two woman US senators - Paula Hawkins of Florida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 22 women who will be serving in the new US House of Representatives , including two newcomers , there are 11 from each party. // Women , who next year will make up 14. 6 percent of the nation ' s 7 , 438 state legislators , include 690 Democrats , 489 Republicans , and 8 independents. // Two years ago women held 13. 3 percent of the state lawmaking chairs , with 586 Democrats , 401 Republicans , and 6 independents. // At least 1 , 151 federal and state elective officials - holdovers as well as those newly elected - are women , according to Deborah Walsh of the Rutgers University-based Center for the American Woman and Politics. // A similar tally two years ago was 100 smaller. // Besides congressional and state legislative seats , women in key elective posts will include two governors , five lieutenant governors , 11 secretaries of state , 11 state treasurers , 1 state auditor , and 1 attorney general. // The latter , Arlene Violet , a Rhode Island Republican and former Roman Catholic nun , is the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation. // Women office seekers also have increasingly made their mark at the municipal and county government levels . In excess of 17 , 000 , more than three times the number a decade ago , now serve as mayors , on city councils and school boards , and in other posts. // Of the 44 states that held legislative elections last month , the number of women lawmakers increased in 25 , remained the same in 6 , and lost ground slightly in 13 . The largest gain was 20 in New Hampshire , from 115 to 134 in the 40-seat House and from 6 to 7 in the 24-seat Senate . In the 180-member Vermont Legislature , there will be 49 women , 17 more than in the previous legislature. // Other notable increases : from 16 to 24 in Idaho , from 23 to 30 in Kansas , from 26 to 33 in Massachusetts , from 28 to 35 in Washington , and from 17 to 23 in Iowa. // The biggest loss of female representation was in Hawaii , where the number slipped from 17 to 13. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate , all but three of the 99 state legislative chambers - the senates in Louisiana , Mississippi , and Virginia - will have at least one woman member . And none of these states elected state legislators this year. // //
