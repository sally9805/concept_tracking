The Presidency <P> For the moment the spirit of Lyndon Johnson and his frequent counselor , the prophet Isaiah ( " Come now , and let us reason together " ) , are back in style . <P> At the White House and on the Hill , the leaders have even dusted off the Ball Rule of Power , named after former Under Secretary of State George Ball , who understood that getting close to a President relieved many frustrations of a policymaker . Said Ball : " Nothing propinks like propinquity . " <P> The ghost of the old Speaker of the House , Sam Rayburn , has also risen and spoken : " Any jackass can kick a barn down , but it takes a carpenter to build it . " <P> Two events in the past few days have brought the White House and the Congress closer together on foreign policy than they have been in many a month , and everybody seems to be benefiting except our adversaries , the Soviet Union and its friends . <P> Why both the Carter and Reagan Administrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past , to reach out for guidance to men and women experienced in the ways of this city , remains a mystery . There is much accumulated wisdom in these streets , and when properly refined and weighed , it can benefit any President . <P> When the struggle over the War Powers Act began last month , the man who designed that legislation , former New York Senator Jacob Javits , went to the Capitol to urge its use . His body is crippled by Lou Gehrig 's disease ( amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ) , but his mind is still honed by his love of reason and country . He would have preferred a six-month limit on presidential authority to keep the Marines in Lebanon instead of the 18-month limit President Reagan wanted . But when it was apparent the six-month limit did not have the necessary votes to pass , he wanted his old chamber to vote for 18 months . That is the statesmanlike way he had done it in his great years in the Senate , when he could move like an athlete and think even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks in part to Jacob Javits , the Congress and the President are in Lebanon together , which is the only way our peace force can really be sustained in its difficult mission . <P> The U.S. Government was also in harmony in Geneva , where last week another round of START began . The President agreed to propose a congressional idea to seek a " build-down " in nuclear missiles and warheads . The political impact was evident . The Soviets were thrown on the defensive ; the antinuclear protesters were given a moment 's pause . The nation for once saw a creative act of foreign policy embraced by both political parties . Good feeling flowed down the streets . But it took a struggle to get such results .
