txt More major companies are getting caught cooking their books , and auditors are feeling the heat . In recent months . JWT Group Inc. , McCormick &; Co. and Saxon Industries Inc. have acknowledged that some of their employees engaged in questionable accounting practices . Meanwhile , Datapoint Corp. , Flight Transportation Corp . and nearly a half-dozen others have been accused of such abuses . The irregularities include deferring expenses , inflating revenue , altering invoices and exaggerating the value of inventories . In all cases , auditors accepted without qualification the accounting practices used by the companies . Accountants predict that many more such abuses will be disclosed before yearend , especially if the economy does n't recover . " Times like these turn over all the worms , " says Richard Murray , general counsel for Touche Ross &; Co . When a company is hit by an accounting scandal , its auditors are usually drawn into the fray . " It causes real disorder in the practice , " says Mr. Murray . Adds Roger Cason , director of national accounting and auditing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's your client , it is n't going to help your career any . " ' Business as Usual ' Accountants say some book juggling is to be expected in a sour economy . Richard Gnospelius , national director of auditing at Coopers &; Lybrand , calls it " business as usual for a period of economic difficulty . " But abuses have come steadily in recent months . Early this year , JWT Group , the parent of the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency , disclosed it would have to charge $30 million to pretax earnings for 1978 through 1981 because it had discovered phony revenue . In May , McCormick , a Hunt Valley , Md. , spice maker , informed the Securities and Exchange Commission and its stockholders that it had restated earnings from 1977 through most of last year because employees had improperly deferred expenses and otherwise juggled the books . Last month , Saxon Industries , which is operating under the protection of federal bankruptcy laws , said that inventories at one of its divisions had been overstated by at least $24 million and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division and the figures in the company 's consolidated financial statements . The accounting tricks used in recent cases do n't appear to be new , but the pattern of scheming is . In the accounting scandals of the early to mid 1970s , employees or executives bled money from operations for their own use . In many of the recent cases , however , employees apparently committed the improprieties under pressure to meet growth goals set by management . The recession has made it increasingly difficult to meet those goals . Some employ- ees feared they would n't receive stock or salary bonuses . Others feared for their jobs . And in some of the cases , employees were gambling on a quarter strong enough to erase their mistakes . " We were all under so much pressure , " recalls a former employee of Datapoint . " We were overzealous , and we were sure it would all work out eventually . But we were buying time , and the time ran out . " Datapoint employees have said they shipped computers to customers who had n't met credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have room for and indulged in other questionable practices . The company says it is investigating . Mr. Murray of Touche Ross says the accounting problems grow geometrically . " If a " We 're telling our people to fine-tune their procedures , sharpen their methods , pay attention , " says a partner in an accounting firm . division uses an accounting ploy to meet a target for the year , then the next year you must make up that deficit in addition to meeting your new goals . You 've got to play the game twice as fast . " Some accountants believe the recent Improprieties are occurring at lower levels of the company than was the case in the past , in operations that should be receiving more attention from internal auditors . Some also believe the scams are more pervasive . In a report to the SEC , McCormick said its accounting problems involved " a substantial number " of the 2,500 employees of its grocery-products division . The report also said five members of the company 's top management , including the president and two directors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such activity might not be surprising at high-growth , image-conscious companies like Datapoint , says Richard Greenfield , a Philadelphia attorney who handles shareholder litigation . But he says that seeing it at McCormick , the conservative spice maker , " makes you wonder how widespread it really is . It makes you ask , where were the auditors ' ? " In some of the cases , the accountants suspect their colleagues probably were too eager to please their clients . Others believe the auditors were deceived by doctored records , fictitious invoices or computer tricks , or were so swamped by the volume of their workloads that they failed to detect the improprieties . " Auditors are ordinary human beings , " says Lee Seidler , a partner in Bear , Stearns &; Co . " How deeply can they dig , given the time limitations on them ? If a salesman gives a wink to the customer and says , ' Take it ; sign the purchase contract and you can bring it back later , ' how is the auditor to know that ? " Adds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's only so much time you can put in and still do a profitable audit . " On the other hand , Abraham Briloff , an accounting professor at Baruch College , part of the City University of New York , believes the cases are " indicative of the fact that there is a great deal of sloppiness in our accounting methods . " Auditor Liability Whatever the cause , the cases have alarmed accountants . By law , the outside auditor is n't responsible for ferreting out fraud . Still , if a client has tampered with the books , the auditor is also tainted , most directly in the shareholder litigation that usually follows . Accounting firms carry liability insurance , but defending against lawsuits is costly . The average deductible for the Big Eight firms is more than $1 million per lawsuit and runs as high as $4 million per lawsuit for one firm , practitioners say . Last November , a federal grand jury ordered Arthur Andersen to pay $80 million to the shareholders of Fund of Funds Ltd. after It found Andersen had failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has asked the court to overturn the verdict . A scandal often costs the accounting firm the client involved , and possibly other clients . " Each time you get sued or named in the press , a few more clients may say to themselves , we do n't want to be associated , " says a partner of one of the Big Eight firms . As a result of its problems , McCormick fired Deloitte , Haskins &; Sells , its auditor of 68 years . JWT Group has postponed a decision to reappoint its auditor , Price Waterhouse &; Co. , pending a review . ( Deloitte declines comment . Price Waterhouse says its audit conformed to generally accepted auditing standards . ) The setbacks come as competition among accounting firms is at a high . Public Accounting Report , a newsletter published in Atlanta . says the number of client changes among large firms has increased about 30% , this year from last year , which also set a record . All the irregularities have resulted in a flurry of internal memos and written warnings at some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to fine-time their procedures , sharpen their methods , pay attention . " says Robert Burmester , a partner with Arthur Young &; Co . He says he keeps files and examines court documents as the cases unravel , watching for information to pass along . His firm is also urging members to study the attitudes of the client 's management toward its own internal controls . Main Hurdman is doing likewise . " We tell our people to be cautious when a client consistently chooses the least conservative approach , " says Mr. Cason . " We tell them to be aware of any delaying of expenses or innovative financing techniques . We are telling them to look more carefully . " At Coopers &; Lybrand , accountants are told to analyze the condition of each client to figure out which economic conditions are causing the most pressure and what the companies might he doing to alleviate the pressure . They are warned to watch for " unreasonable management pressures in the face of difficult times , " says Mr. Gnospehus .
