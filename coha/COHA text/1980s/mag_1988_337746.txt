The battle against drug smugglers sometimes turns into a shooting war , as Mexico City Bureau Chief John Borrell discovered last week while on assignment along the U.S.-Mexico border . His report : <P> In Starr County , Texas , the U.S. Border Patrol truck sits , engine idling , on a dirt track near the Rio Grande . Its headlights have been off since it left the highway half an hour earlier and bumped across rough farm roads to within a few hundred yards of Mexico , just visible in the moonlight on the far bank of the river . <P> A radio suddenly spews a stream of static into the blacked-out cab . An agent scouting ahead for a gang of suspected drug smugglers has spotted his quarry . " They are at the edge of the brush , " a voice whispers excitedly . " They are moving . I can see the sacks they are carrying . " <P> Leo Laurel and Juan Trevino , the two senior agents commanding the operation , scan the road ahead through binoculars . " Got them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into the scrub . " Laurel quickly checks the position of another Border Patrol unit , which has been maneuvering to cut the gang off from the river . " We need to bust them now , " Laurel radios . " We 're coming in fast . " <P> Gunning the engine , Laurel races down the rutted track . Even before the truck comes to a halt , Trevino is out and running . Suddenly shots are fired , and bullets buzz overhead . Muffled shouts and the sounds of breaking branches come from a thicket of mesquite . Then more shots , this time a short burst from an automatic weapon . A handgun replies purposefully . The shooting stops as abruptly as it started . <P> A paunchy , middle-aged Mexican is lying on the side of the track . His arm is bleeding , and he has been hit in the stomach . An agent radios for an ambulance . " He turned on us with this , " says Trevino , a 9-mm semiautomatic Taurus pistol in his hand . " We were lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that borders the track another agent has pinned to the ground a second member of the gang , this one unarmed . Around the prisoner are nearly a dozen 30-lb. sacks of marijuana abandoned by his fellow " mules . " The total load will weigh out at 317 lbs. , worth about $250,000 in South Texas and much more elsewhere in the U.S. If they had n't been busted , the mules , who earn $200 a trip , would have carried the marijuana up to the highway and loaded it into a waiting car . <P> For the Border Patrol 's McAllen sector , 280 miles of the U.S.-Mexico boundary , this drug bust last week was the third in as many days , although the first for months involving a shoot-out on U.S. soil . South Texas is one of the most important points of entry into the U.S. for Mexican-grown marijuana , as well as cocaine from Colombia . Last year the Border Patrol in the McAllen sector captured drugs worth more than $182 million . Yet for all their success , the Border Patrol and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs coming across the Mexican border . <P> An ambulance from nearby Rio Grande City arrives for the wounded man . The other captured smuggler is taken off in a truck . Laurel issues new orders to his men , then reflects on the night 's events . " I do n't like it when the shooting starts , " he says . " Your luck has got to run out sometime . "
