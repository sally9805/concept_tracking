For all its efforts to lessen the impact of the Afghanistan invasion on Soviet citizens , the Kremlin leadership is beginning to discover that the war has caused considerable disquiet and difficulties on the home front . Although there are no credible casualty figures , Dissident Andrei Sakharov has spoken of " thousands " of Soviet deaths ; relatives and friends of soldiers have become uncomfortably aware that the number of casualties is high . According to Moscow-based European diplomats , Soviet authorities have stopped burying soldiers with full military honors in an apparent attempt to divert attention from the deaths . Many of the seriously wounded have been flown for treatment to hospitals in East Germany instead of the U.S.S.R. , apparently to conceal the extent of casualties . <P> Now , says a European businessman , " all over Moscow , for the first time , people are beginning to whisper in the shops , to ask what exactly is going on . " Some Westerners attending the Olympic Games heard plaintive and angry words about Afghanistan , usually from people who brought up the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of Soviet citizens raised the issue , speaking openly , worriedly and almost compulsively . The first was a young woman who , after a brief back-and-forth about the Olympic boycott , admitted : " We should never have gone into Afghanistan . Never . We will fight there for years . It was a terrible mistake . It will be like Viet Nam . " When it was suggested that , tragically , thousands of soldiers will come home in coffins , she wheeled with frustration in her eyes : " What do you mean will ? Thousands already have come home in coffins . And it is only the beginning . " <P> Another conversation was with an official involved in security for the Games . " I have two friends who have been killed in Afghanistan , " he confided . " One I have known since boyhood . He has a daughter too , just as I do . I look at my child and I think of my friend and I wonder should we ever have had children ? It is a terrible time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> His voice flared with anger , and he made a spitting gesture . He explained that traditionally the graves of fallen Soviet soldiers have been inscribed DIED FOR THE MOTHERLAND . But not for Afghanistan . " Do you know what they put on their tombstones ? Four words : DIED FOR INTERNATIONAL DUTY ! What is that ? I do not know what ' international duty ' is . But this is what they put on the graves . " And he made the contemptuous spitting gesture again .
