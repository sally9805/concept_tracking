The two men , Pope John Paul in a white robe and Chief Rabbi Elio Toaff in a prayer shawl , stood side by side in Rome 's main synagogue for a moment of silent prayer . Then they joined in an enthusiastic embrace . The throng of 1,000 people packed into the ornate synagogue , 40 of whom were survivors of Nazi death camps , burst into thunderous applause . Some wept openly . <P> The embrace was the climax of an 80-minute ceremony last week during a historic pre-Passover call by John Paul at the synagogue ; it was the first time that a Pope is known to have visited a Jewish house of worship . Initiated by a personal request from the Pontiff , the carefully planned event included mutual declarations of respect by the Pope ( who twice used Hebrew phrases ) and the Chief Rabbi , Bible readings , hymns and the rendition by a cantor and choir of Ani Ma'amin , a traditional profession of faith sung by Jews as they were led to the gas chambers . Because of the congregation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> To the congregation  --  Europe 's oldest , dating to the 2nd century B.C.  --  the visit was particularly significant . For centuries the Jews of Rome , under papal rule , had suffered discrimination and humiliation , were confined to a ghetto and were forced to attend sermons urging them to convert . An ironic proverb expressed their feelings of hopelessness : " The persecution will end when the Pope enters the synagogue . " <P> Official persecution had ended long before last week 's momentous visit  --  in 1870 , when the papal states were overthrown and Italy abolished the ghetto . But the Pope did not flinch from obliquely recalling the church 's harsh treatment of Jews . He decried the " gravely deplorable manifestations " of the past and , quoting from a declaration of the Second Vatican Council , stated that the church " deplores the hatred , persecutions and displays of anti- Semitism directed against the Jews at any time and by anyone . " Then the Pope added , to ringing applause , " I repeat : by anyone . " John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of millions by the Nazis and , as did Rabbi Toaff , paid tribute to the Catholics who at great risk helped Rome 's Jews , among whom 11,000 of 13,000 survived the German occupation . <P> In their speeches to the Pope , both Giacomo Saban , lay president of Rome 's Jewish community , and Rabbi Toaff called for the Vatican to extend diplomatic recognition to Israel , a divisive issue between the two faiths . " Spiritually and emotionally , " said Saban , " Israel is central to the heart of every Jew . " The Chief Rabbi took the issue a theological step further by stating that the return of the Jews to the homeland was part of " God 's final plan of redemption . " But John Paul in his 3,000-word address made no mention of Israel , and a Vatican spokesman later said that the papal visit had been purely religious in nature and that the inclusion of any such political issue would have been inappropriate . <P> While Jewish leaders were upset at the omission , Israel 's President Chaim Herzog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the correcting of the injustice which the church perpetrated on the Jewish people during 1,500 years . " To Rabbi Toaff , the occasion was " a turning point in the history of the church , " one that finally " puts the two religions on a level of equality . "
