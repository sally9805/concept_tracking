A nervous silence fell over the audience as the General Secretary paused to catch his breath . Throughout the opening day of the 27th Soviet Communist Party Congress , Mikhail Gorbachev , standing behind a polished wood lectern emblazoned with a hammer and sickle , had hectored and preached with passion and zeal . Caught by a momentary fit of coughing , he inhaled deeply and scanned the thousands of faces that filled the plush red seats before him . Offhandedly , Gorbachev remarked , " I am coming to the end . " Hesitantly at first , then in mounting waves , appreciative laughter swept through the cavernous Kremlin Palace of Congresses . <P> Times have changed . When Gorbachev concluded his marathon 5 1/2-hour keynote speech last week , he had proved beyond a doubt that he is a determined foe of social corruption and economic inefficiency . He demanded radical improvements in the feeble Soviet agricultural program and lashed out against the misuse of power by Soviet officials . He also etched an acid appraisal of the 18-year rule of the late Leonid Brezhnev , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , laughter from delegates would have been unthinkable . <P> Gorbachev aggressively reminded Washington that he can be a tough customer . He scoffed at a counterproposal by President Reagan for eliminating medium- range nuclear missiles by 1990 and , along the way , displayed a penchant for bareknuckle bullying reminiscent of Nikita Khrushchev . Indeed , the General Secretary showed little inclination to tone down his anti-U.S . rhetoric . Quoting Karl Marx , he described capitalism as a " hideous pagan idol , who would not drink nectar but from the skulls of the slain . " The U.S. , he declared , is " the metropolitan center of imperialism . " In part such pronouncements were intended to appease the party 's Old Guard , some of whom are still suspicious of the 55-year-old leader . Television monitors at the press center for foreign journalists repeatedly flashed anti-U.S . " news headlines . " Read one : U.S. CHILDREN DIE OF CRUEL TREATMENT . <P> Gorbachev 's overall performance was a Jekyll-and-Hyde melange of personal charisma and calibrated bluster . He used stock phrases and body language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted his criticism of Soviet poor production practices with timid silence . The Pavlovian technique paid off . The second time he complained about slipshod work habits , he received an instant ovation . Jested Gorbachev : " Now I see I have twice won your applause by reminding you of the need for change . " At the end of his speech , he glanced at his watch after a minute of applause . The cheers ceased abruptly . <P> Gorbachev conveyed a sense of urgency about the economic problems faced by the Soviet Union . Said he : " Comrades , a problem we will have to solve in the shortest time possible is that of fully meeting our country 's food needs . " His prescription for progress in agricultural production : better and more independent management of farms , more efficient harvest and transport of crops , and improved farm technology . He also promised to carry on his purge against corruption and laziness , which have driven hundreds of party and government officials from jobs they once regarded as sinecures.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
