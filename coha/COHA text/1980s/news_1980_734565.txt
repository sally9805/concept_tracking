txt Amax Inc. won its battle with Hudson Bay Mining &; Smelting Co. to acquire control of Rosario Resources Corp . Amax announced it purchased 37% of Rosario 's stock outstanding , including the 9.8% block held by Hudson Bay . Amax , a minerals and energy producer based in Greenwich , Conn. , had signed a merger agreement with Rosario of New York last October to acquire the precious metals and oil concern for $55 a share in cash and stock . However , that accord fell through when Hudson Bay , based in Toronto , announced a $65-a-share tender offer in January for Rosario 's stock . Amax 's latest purchase , which caught observers by surprise , was at an even higher price . Amax said it paid Hudson Bay $75 a share , Thursday 's closing price on the New York Stock Exchange , for its 597,600 Rosario shares , or $44.8 million . Since the Federal Trade Commission had n't authorized Amax to purchase any Rosario stock until Thursday , an Amax source confirmed , Amax 's other stock purchases also must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 2.3 million shares of Rosario. said it will resume merger discussions with Rosario shortly , probably this week . Amax would n't say how it will restructure its offer for the rest of Rosario , but a source close to the company said " Amax might n't have to go as high as $75 a share if it offers stock , " which would be taxed less heavily than a straight cash offer . In Toronto , E. P. Gush , Hudson Bay 's president , said the company 's decision to withdraw its bid was " more or less " made at its quarterly board meeting last Thursday . " The fact that Amax had acquired a substantial interest in Rosario at a market price considerably higher than our offer price " was the main factor behind the decision , he said . He also cited delays imposed by an FTC request for additional information . Mr. Gush said the FTC made its request about a week before the company 's board meeting . " We were about to send them our replies when we saw the Amax activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request as " Just normal queries , " while the company 's senior vice president , administration , C. K. Taylor , said , " They were about Hudson Bay itself and its activities . " Mr. Taylor noted that antitrust considerations were " obviously an outstanding matter . Amax had been cleared through the antitrust procedure , wherein we ' had n't been . " Both offfdals denied , that any political concerns were raised stemming from Hudson Bay 's parentage . The company is about 45%-owned by Anglo American Corp . of South Africa Ltd . Nothing like that entered into it , " Mr. Taylor said , " it was simply a matter of going through the process and the market place . " Mr. Gush said he could n't comment on reports that Rosario had considered the Hudson Bay offer unfriendly because of the South African connection . " We hardly spoke to Rosario once Qur bid was on the table , because of legal restrains , " he said . Ironically , while Hudson Bay lost the battle for Rosario , it may yet win a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding in Hecla Mining Co. , a leading silver producer . Hudson Bay said in material filed with its tender offer for Rosario that it had previously approached Amax to try to get Amax to agree to sell Hudson Bay the Hecla interest , presuming Amax acquired Rosario . " It looks like Amax outsmarted Hudson Bay , but there may have been something between the lines , " an arbitrager commented . " Amax might have agreed to sell the Hecla interest " Sources close to Amax confirmed that " there had been talks " between Amax and Hudson Bay over Rosario 's Hecla interest . but would n't comment further . Asked whether Hudson Bay had reached any agreement or understanding with Amax , Mr. Gush replied , " None whatsoever , apart from our agreement to sell them our Rosario shares . " An Amax spokesman said the company " would n't have trouble " getting any financing it might need to complete a purchase of Rosano . Amax officials have predicted that the company 's 1979 earnings  --  to be announced this week  --  will top $360 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amax is believed to desperately want Rosario to ward off a takeover bid by Standard Oil Co. of California , which owns about 20% of Amax . In addition , Rosario 's oil , gas and precious metals assets have increased sharply , due to steep price increases in those commodities , since the initial Amax-Rosario agreement to merge .
