Administration officials and advocates of disability rights said the guidelines drafted by the American Academy of Pediatrics did not adequately protect the rights of handicapped infants because they placed too much emphasis on " quality of life " and too little on the potential for life-saving medical treatment. // Typically , the Government and hospitals protect the privacy in families involved in such cases by describing the infants only as Baby Doe. // One such infant , in Bloomington , Ind. , died in 1982 after food and medical treatment were withheld with the approval of parents and state courts . In another case , on Long Island , the parents refused to authorize surgery on a girl born with an opening of the spine , which has sinced closed naturally . The parents had argued that even with the life-saving surgery , the child would be retarded and physically disabled. // // Koop Rejects Invitation // // The American Academy of Pediatrics plans to hold a news conference here Friday to issue the guidelines for hospital ethics committees . The pediatricians invited the Surgeon General of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectation that he would endorse the guidelines . But he turned down the invitation . James W. Buchan , a spokesman for Dr. Koop , said , " He ' s not in complete agreement with what they will announce. " // Diane M. Crutcher , executive director of the National Down ' s Syndrome Congress , a private nonprofit organization , said : " The procedures are not protective of handicapped infants . There is still too much quality-of-life judgment and not enough emphasis on medical considerations . " Antiabortion groups also voiced opposition. // Dr. M. Harry Jennison , executive director of the American Academy of Pediatrics , said he was surprised at the unfavorable reaction because the pediatricians had made a " good-faith effort " to insure protection of the infants ' rights and interests. // Dr. Jennison said the pediatricians would not change the guidelines this week , but he left open the possibility they might be revised in the future . <> <> ' More Dialogue ' Sought // // " This is the beginning , not the end of the process , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have legitimate , constructive suggestions . We feel we have performed a public service by drafting the guidelines. " // President Reagan has taken a personal interest in the protection of handicapped infants , a complex issue with broad political , legal and medical implications . A directive he issued in April 1982 , after the death of the Bloomington infant , began a process that led to issuance of Federal regulations in March 1983 calling for hospitals to provide food and medical care to severely handicapped infants . The Government also set up telephone " hot lines " and " Baby Doe squads " to investigate complaints about treatment. // Doctors and hospitals challenged the rules as Government intrusion into the nursery and into the practice of medicine . The Administration did not entirely abandon the " hot lines " and " Baby Doe squads " but recommended that hospitals voluntarily establish " infant care review committees " to oversee treatment. // Then , last November , the Down ' s Syndrome group , the Academy of Pediatrics , the National Association of Children ' s Hospitals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment of disabled individuals . " <> <> Principles Laid Out // // It said : " When medical care is clearly beneficial , it should always be provided . Considerations such as anticipated or actual limited potential of an individual , and present or future lack of available community resources , are irrelevant and must not determine the decisions concerning medical care . The individual ' s medical condition should be the sole focus of the decision. " // The Academy of Pedriatrics then set about drafting guidelines to carry out this agreement. // Paul A. Marchand of the Association for Retarded Citizens , a private nonprofit group that signed the statement of principles , said he was " acutely disappointed " with the guidelines . He said they violated the spirit of both the treatment principles and a second set of Federal regulations issued in January. // The regulations said one member of each infant care review committee must be designated as a " special advocate for the infant . " The academy ' s guidelines say nothing about such advocates , nor do they say the baby ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any decision . The guidelines stress the need for " an atmosphere of collaboration " and " consensus " among doctors and family members . <> <> Need for ' Advocate ' Disputed // // Dr. Jennison of the academy said : " There will be an ample number of people on the ethics committees who serve that function of being an advocate for the child . A separate ombudsman really is not necessary. " // The academy guidelines said each committee should have at least 10 members : a pediatrician and another practicing physician , a nurse , a hospital administrator , a parent of a disabled child or a representative of a disability group , a social worker , a clergyman , a lawyer , a person trained in ethics or philosophy and a " lay community member. " // " The committee , " according to the guidelines , " should review all cases in which the attending physician and parents propose to forgo life-sustaining treatment for an infant . " If the committee could not achieve a consensus through discussions , members would vote on recommendations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions , " the guidelines said. // The antiabortion movement has formed an uneasy alliance with disability rights groups in Baby Doe cases . Gary L. Curran of the American Life Lobby said : " If the academy guidelines become the official interpretation of rubber stamp for decisions not to treat handicapped infants . " Kent E. Smith , executive director of the Spina Bifida Association of America , a private nonprofit group , said : " The guidelines do not go far enough in protecting the rights of newborn infants with disabilities that can be treated . We have pushed for a long time to let people know that adoption is an alternative to nontreatment of the disabled child . Nowhere in the guidelines is that view supported. " // //
