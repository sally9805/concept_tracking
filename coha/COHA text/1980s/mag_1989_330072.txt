When he burst upon the takeover scene in the early 1980s , Asher Edelman seemed to have a magic touch . Bright , brash and hyperconfident , he reaped more than $40 million in instant profits for himself and his investors by raiding and liquidating two dreary companies : Management Assistance , a computer maker , and Canal-Randolph , a real estate firm . Suddenly superrich , the Bard College graduate , reared on Long Island , N.Y. , bought fashionable residences from Sun Valley to Switzerland , a 100-ft. yacht , a personal jet and a modern-art collection today rumored to be worth $100 million . <P> The battle cry of all raiders is to " maximize shareholder value , " but few of them blew the trumpets like Edelman . In 1987 he taught a business course at Columbia University that he aptly dubbed " The Art of War . " Edelman offered $100,000 to any student who could find a mismanaged company for the professor to chew up . Columbia nixed the offer , but Edelman 's image as a buccaneer flourished . That same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greedy Gordon Gekko in Wall Street . " I hunched in my seat as I watched that movie , " says Edelman . " I 've never committed any crimes . " <P> Even so , Edelman , 50 , has plenty of reasons to hunch . Since 1986 he has launched hostile raids on ten large corporations and nine of the bids have failed , though Edelman has collected some greenmail for quitting the attacks . He managed to capture one of his prey , the Ponderosa restaurant chain , but resold it without a profit . <P> When Edelman has tried to operate companies rather than simply auction off their parts , the results have been just as dismal . Example : Datapoint , a San / Antonio-based minicomputer maker . Since Edelman took it over in 1985 , the company has gone through three presidents and $135 million in losses . Yet he has reaped millions of dollars in personal fees by aggressively playing the stock market with Datapoint 's cash . Another Edelman-controlled firm , Intelogic Trace , a computer-servicing business that was spun off from Datapoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $20 million in that year to $179,000 in fiscal 1989 . <P> Edelman got a taste of his own tactics last September , when Manhattan lawyer Martin Ackerman launched a proxy war for Datapoint . Edelman responded by entrenching himself more deeply . In a two-day blitz of stock buying , Edelman boosted his stake from 10% to 40% , largely by purchasing stock with cash from Intelogic Trace . Edelman won , but pride had its price : Datapoint shares have fallen an additional 25% in value . <P> Because Edelman feels that U.S. attitudes toward raiders have become too hostile , he now prefers to stalk European game . Yet his magic touch is fading . In June , Edelman made a failed bid for Storehouse PLC , a British retailing giant . Since then Storehouse 's profits and stock price have plunged , wiping out some 35% of the value of Edelman 's stake .
