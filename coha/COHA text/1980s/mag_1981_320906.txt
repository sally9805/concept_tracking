For thousands of weekend sailors , summer means just one thing <P> The brilliant palette of Dacron sail stands taut in the breeze , while below it the bright twin pontoons slice the sea into a foaming , sun-dazzled wake . As the breeze quickens , one of the pontoons flies free of the water , bringing whoops of excitement from the boat 's two occupants . <P> Welcome to the world of the Hobie Cat addict , that 100,000-strong armada of hopelessly smitten enthusiasts who insist that nothing in life quite measures up to the unrestrained joy of breezing along on a twin-hulled Hobie . <P> The Hobie catamaran , which suggests a Polynesian outrigger canoe with a sail , is the creation of Nautical Designer Hobart ( Hobie ) Alter , 47 , of Capistrano Beach , Calif . In the 13 years since the first Hobie Cat set sail , the craft has become the favorite American weekend sailboat by far and helped make Alter a millionaire several times over . Though the twin hulls of Hobie Cats make the vessels a bit tougher to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Cat is in its exhilarating speed . The lightweight vessels can reach a motorboat clip of nearly 25 m.p.h. in a fresh wind . Exclaimed the America 's Cup champion Ted Turner after sailing a Hobie Cat : " That 's the most fun I ever had in my whole life on any sailboat , and I 've been on a lot of sailboats ! " <P> Hobie Cats come in sizes ranging from 14 ft. to 18 ft. , but the most popular is the Hobie 16 , which sells for about $3,000 , plus some $400 more for a package of extras like a colored sail . More than 50,000 of the aluminum and fiberglass vessels have been sold since the model was launched in 1971 , and Hobie 16 races and regattas are now part of the summertime scene from Laguna Beach to Long Island . <P> Alter , an inveterate tinkerer , endeared himself in the mid-1950s to an earlier generation of Californians by introducing the first mass-produced balsa-wood and fiberglass surfboards . By 1960 he had become the world 's leading supplier of the custom-made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California lifestyle . <P> In 1976 Alter , who had grown bored with the administrative end of his sailboat business , sold out to a camping-equipment maker , the Coleman Co. of Wichita , Kans . " I did n't want to be head of anything because then you have to go to meetings and junk , " says Alter , who instead signed on with Coleman as a designer and began casting about for something different to create . The result : a 33-ft. fiberglass sloop , the Hobie 33 . Equipped with a retractable keel and a mast that can be easily removed for transportation , the boat is small enough to be towed behind a car on a trailer , yet large enough to sleep up to seven . The sleek vessel is priced to sail away at about $40,000 , vs. as much as $70,000 for other similar size vessels . <P> Dealers are already queuing up to sell the new boats , the first of which will be ready some time in the fall . Says Edmund Laviano , president of Bellpat Marine of East Patchogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's doing 30 knots just sitting at the dock . I want one the minute the boat is available . " The tinkerer from Southern California , who shepherded Americans onto surfboards in the 1960s and onto Hobie Cats in the 1970s , now hopes to lead them onto deepwater sailing ships in the 1980s.
