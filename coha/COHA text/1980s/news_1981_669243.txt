He is a small man with tufty , curly reddish-gray hair and tiny , twinkling eyes , a lot of opinions , and a terrifying giggle . Ask him what it was like to live through those years , and you ' ll hear it : a squeaky giggle that would sound silly if it weren ' t laced with blackest irony . The anecdotes that follow it are frightful , but the tone of the giggle must have daunted even the KGB , the Soviet secret police. // This is the man who says he said to Sergei Ivanivich Gavrilov , a high-ranking interrogator , liaison between the KGB and Central Committee , that if after five years he was still being detained in the Soviet Union , " You ' ll encounter new troubles which , I assure you , you don ' t anticipate . Either you ' ll have to let me go , or you ' ll have to imprison me for a long term ; you won ' t have any other choice . You know a lot about me , Sergei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying . . . . So there are the alternatives for you . Which do you prefer : simply to let me go , or to create another martyr to arouse the sympathies of the scientific community ? It seems to me that in this case our interests coincide. " // This after four years " in refusal , " a limbo Soviet Jews find themselves in after applying for a visa to emigrate , being refused because of a bureaucratic technicality , and reapplying . A long wait usually follows for the " refuseniks . " Azbel , a theoretical physicist , found himself cut off from society and fired from his job after applying to emigrate to Israel in 1972 . Waiting for a visa that might never come , he endured 10-hour interrogation sessions , brief imprisonments , and a hunger strike . His phone was disconnected and friends were exiled to Siberia , and he himself took to carrying a toothbrush whenever he was summoned to KGB headquarters in case he was sent straight to prison . Even so , he says he was still able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to threaten him. // There are many refuseniks . Action for Soviet Jewry , a Boston-based group , has a list of 1 , 000 Jewish families in refusal in the USSR , but suspects there are about 2 , 000 more families it doesn ' t know about . And , it seems , the situation is getting worse . Not only is their right to emigrate being more directly attacked while they are in refusal , but also fewer are allowed to leave . The number of exit visas granted by the Soviet Union to Jews hit a five-year low of 500 in August , down from 4 , 800 visas in the peak month of October 1979. // But not for lack of commitment from Azbel . The man who talked back to the KGB is a daunting interview subject . He is so direct that talking to him is a little like being grabbed and shaken by the shoulders . " Refusenik " is not the kind of book one can talk about in the abstract . Reality stalks us at every turn of phrase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read , with the wonderful exhilaration at the end , when he and his wife and daughter took off for Israel , where he now teaches at Tel Aviv University , he said , " Exciting for you ! You knew how it ended ! " and chuckled blackly. // Actually , the story is still unfolding , and it ' s getting more grim . People mentioned in the book have since been arrested , and Azbel dispenses with literary chatter to get to the point of the interview : His friend , computer scientist Victor Brailovsky , has been sentenced to five years in exile in Siberia , and it is up the interviewer , personally , to save him , he says , looking piercingly at me . " Write letters , " he commands , and when I ask whom I should write to  --  Brailovsky himself ?  --  my naivete brings out the squeaky giggle at its most deadly serious : " No , not Brailovsky ! Reagan ! Senators ! Be useful ! " // " This is not a book by a writer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There are living beings . This is a message , this is what goes on. " // I am to tell readers , " Would they please receive the message that has already been sent to them , despite of the fact that it is enormously expensive which is $18 , which each one of them spends maybe in a day , not even for dinner ? " Subtlety and tact are Western luxuries Azbel has no time for. // Most who apply to emigrate from the Soviet Union are Jews , because of the anti-Semitism rife there . The book tells of the harassment of the whole community of Jewish scientists who have applied and been refused permission to emigrate . The scientists and their families become a world unto themselves . All of them are fired from their laboratories , forbidden to publish their work , constantly hauled in for questioning by the KGB , deserted by friends , and threatened with a litany of trumped-up charges such as " parasitism "  --  not having a job  --  or " hooliganism . " Demonstrating for the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by demonstrators constitutes " hooliganism , " Azbel says. // It is almost impossible for refuseniks to find work in their fields , and even menial jobs as doormen are in jeopardy if it is discovered that they are really laid-off Jewish physicists , chemists , or computer scientists . For applying to emigrate , they are fired ; for not having a job , they are arrested. // Sadly , the refuseniks ' lot today is so much worse that Azbel ' s time in refusal almost looks like the good old days . Victor Brailovsky ' s case is a good example . Brailovsky and his wife and children had b een waiting nine years for visas when he was sentenced in June to five years of interior exile . What is frightening for refuseniks is that Brailovsky is charged not with parasitism or hooliganism , but with " defamation of the Soviet state . " His case is one of the first in which a request for emigration , as well as a letter Brailovsky is alleged to have written to President Carter asking for help , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially , he is being punished for applying to emigrate . Soviet citizens have a constitutional right to apply for emigration , but once they apply , until they get out  --  if they get out  --  they are punished , according to refusenik accounts . " Now they Soviet officials don ' t even try to pretend " by calling it parasitism or hooliganism , Azbel says , " and again they show they do not care " about whether what they do is legal or not . For the legal system to be used so directly against a refusenik implies that the climate for Jews in the Soviet Union has become infinitely worse , according to American professors who have visited their counterparts in the USSR , and Allen Dershowitz , one of several lawyers from different countries who worked on behalf of the Shcharansky family. // An appeal on behalf of Brailovsky was denied Aug. 14 . As this story goes to press , he is on a train where political dissidents are outnumbered by other criminals such as murderers and rapists . The journey may last a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick up , but will end in Siberia . Brailovsky will probably serve only two years , since he has done a year in prison already , and one day in prison , under the Soviet system , is computed as three days in exile . Exile consists of menial labor in a primitive town where , most likely , he will be ostracized by townspeople. // Pressure brought to bear from the West can help , says Azbel . But " nobody should ask himself how the world can change Russia . That is much too general . Let him ask himself how he personally can help . . . . I believe only in personal approach . Don ' t be general. " // In case we need additional motivation , Azbel spells out a terrifying scenario : " Americans do not understand that the case of Brailovsky is the model case for Jewish activists . And model case for Jewish activists is model case for Jewish emigration . And Jewish emigration is model case for the whole . . . survival of freedom of thought in Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , America will know nothing about what goes on in Russia , and that means Russia will be free to do what she pleases , and that means a return to Stalin ' s times  --  which are much too close . If Stalin ' s times come , it will be much too frightening , much too dangerous for Americans. " // Given his experience with the KGB , it is no wonder that , in an interview , he doesn ' t answer questions , he contradicts them . When asked how he found the courage to keep refusing to cooperate with the KGB , for example , he says , his eyes twinkling with grim merriment : " Fright . " He kept his integrity , not signing a single " confession " the KGB had ready for him about any of the other refuseniks , even when they were innocuous , because anything could be used to mount a case against his friends . " People are only afraid of day-to-day events , " he says , which is a big mistake , because they " do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in danger has found there is nothing more frightening than death . And informing is a moral death . " To inform on his friends would mean " I would have to drop the whole idea of emigration , " because survival of refuseniks depends so much on the personal relations which keep them from losing hope . If you inform , " you lose everybody , including even the KGB , even they don ' t care about you anymore . They are all lost . So you have to live all your life as a nonperson . . . . So I would say I kept my integrity due to my being frightened of this possibility. . . . // " Also , I knew what I wanted , that was a help , " he says . " Understanding there was no life for me in Russia. . . . it was really not that difficult. " // Perhaps he meant " simple . " Because it was certainly difficult . Not only did he throw all that energy into returning the beleaguerment of the KGB and finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parasitism , he also kept active in his field . Starting in 1972 , the refusenik scientists , led by theoretical physicist Alexander Voronel , held sunday scientific seminars , at which they could read their papers to each other in an effort to keep their scientific work alive as much as possible . These seminars grew as the refusenik population did . And they were visited by American scientists in Moscow during US-Soviet scientific exchanges . After Voronel got his visa and emigrated in 1974 , Azbel took over. // Dr. David Baltimore of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , a Nobel laureate in molecular biology , remembers the seminar he attended as a " very serious gathering of scientists who did not share a common scientific background , but were drawing on it for intellectual sustenance . It was a magnificent experience . " Many of the people he met there as a visitor , he said , have since been granted visas . But " the kindest people , " he says , " the ones who took us there to Azbel ' s apartment , the Brailovskys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exile . He described Brailovsky as a " gentle , thoughtful , dedicated person , " and said " it ' s an international crime " that he is in exile. // Other scientists who had visited the seminar also remarked on Brailovsky ' s kindness and hospitality . Bertrand Halperin , a professor of physics at HArvard , remembers visiting Azbel when he was in the hospital . Brailovsky , who took him there , insisted on paying for the taxi , even though the few rubles amounted to " several days ' subsistence " for him. // It was Brailovsky who took over the seminars after Azbel emigrated , and most observers agree that this is why he was arrested and exiled . The seminars were prevented from meeting by the KGB for about six weeks . Then , in February , they were left alone . Dorothy Hirsch , director of the Committee of Concerned Scientists , an American group that has in particular taken up the cause of the refuseniks and Latin American scientists , says that a series of Sunday seminars in exile , held all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may have brought pressure on the Soviet Union to let them continue . In the spring there were more difficulties , and after the summer recess , she says , " there is apprehension and speculation on what will happen when they try to resume seminars in the fall . " This fall there will be an international conference under the auspices of the Sunday seminars . American scientists and scientists from other countries have been invited. // According to Peter Pershen , a professor of applied physics at Harvard , who also read a paper at one of the seminars , it is not so surprising that American scientists are in touch with refusenik scientists in the Soviet Union . Science , he pointed out , is by its nature international . He was about to call a friend in Denmark , for example , to ask him to join him on an experiment in Hamburg. // There were many official conferences between the United States and the Soviet Union . Pershen and Halperin , both aware of the mistreatment of Jewish scientists in the Soviet Union , debated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go and to make a side trip to visit the Sunday scientific seminars . The Soviets knew they were doing this , since the refuseniks were under close KGB supervision . Halperin and a another physicist , James Langer , were held up for five hours at Mowcow airport when they were invited for a special " jubilee " seminar at Azbel ' s apartment , and were let go under the threat of expulsion from the Soviet Union if they attended the seminar . Pershen made it obvious where he was going as well. // When Pershen got to the seminar , he said , he found a " sparse apartment , about as big as this  --  " he indicates his office , which is roomy , but not for a family of three and a seminar . It was as crowded as a wedding in a two-room flat , he says . When a member of the American group told Pershen he had been told it was " dangerous " to visit refuseniks , he worried he might have put them in jeopardy . Indeed , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . However , Pershen says they told him , " we shouldn ' t be afraid anything would happen to them . The USSR had to kill them or let them go , and nothing worse could happen. " // Halperin arrived at a particularly " gloomy time , " after dissident scientists Anatoly Shcharansky and Yuri Orlov were arrested , but " it was a very joyous occasion , very moving . " The KGB had been trying to stop the jubilee seminar , and no one knew if it would come off at all . " For the moment , they were overjoyed , " Halperin said . He added that Azbel was such a vital force  --  after five minutes of a 20-minute talk in English , Azbel would summarize what was said in about one minute of fast Russian  --  that he worried about the seminar ' s continuation after Azbel ' s release . The seminar went on for four days , and " by the second day , the atmosphere had changed . There was such concern for Orlov and Shcharansky that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an obvious conflict between the group ' s desire to " keep up with their science " and the desperate situation they felt they were in , he said. // Halperin felt , however , that being publicized ( two of the special seminars were covered in Newsweek ) and keeping contact with Western scientists protected the refuseniks . Both professors said that their ability to help out was limited , but that being in touch with Soviet scientists gave them some leverage . Though Halperin said it was not in him to chide visiting Soviet scientists said to hav e betrayed refuseniks because he had no idea how he himself would act under similar pressure ( the KGB is a threat to everyone in the scientific world , not just Jews ) , Pershen felt it was advisable to take such people aside and point out that it was known they had collaborated with the KGB . He reported proudly that at the Russian-American Theoretical Physics seminar , he challenged two scientists who Azbel had said spoke against him . Shortly after that , he said , Azbel was allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he shrugged. // There is a dilemma , David Baltimore says , about whether to go to meetings at all . " The scientific community has historically considered itself an international community , " he says . " They put allegiances to each other on a par with allegiances to their countries . There is a tremendous affinity scientists feel for someone who is working on a similar problem , " whenever that person may be working . The Pugwash movement , a peace movement started as an international peace conference in Pugwash , Nova Scotia , in 1955 , " maintained contact between Soviets and Western scientists all through the cold war and continues , " he says . But , he added , " There are a lot of people who are conflicted today over whether to isolate the Soviet Union because of human rights violations , or contact the Soviet Union in the interests of world peace. " // The US State Department , in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , stopped funding official Soviet-American exchanges except for those that dealt with humanitarian problems such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response to Schcharansky ' s exile , the National Academy of Sciences notified the Soviet Academy of Sciences that all joint symposiums , seminars , and workshops between the academies were suspended for six months . That suspension has been extended pending the outcome of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe being held in Madrid , which is due to reconvene in October. // But individual contacts continue. // " I am often asked by American scientists , " Azbel says , whether it is better to boycott Soviet scientific gatherings , or to keep the contacts in order to see refuseniks . " If you just keep the contacts , why should the Soviets change anything ? If you just stop the contacts , what for ? They will do it anyway . That won ' t change their system , and you do not specify what you want them to do . You might specify that you stop the contacts because , let ' s say , Orlov and Shcharansky are in prison or because physicist Andrei Sakharov is in exile . But after they are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the release of a refusenik a condition for further scientific contact and make the condition clear before the refusenik is sentenced , Azbel suggests . The Soviet Union rarely commutes a sentence , and to do do under Western pressure is highly unlikely . " You have to have a relation between people and nations , " he says , " but allow everybody to save face . Just be very communicative , very polite. " // For scientists who have been traditionally seen as head-in-the-clouds apolitical geniuses , the problems of their colleagues in the Soviet Union are more and more a political cause they rally around , Dorothy Hirsch says . Many are declining invitations to the Soviet Union as a matter of conscience. // As for the rest of us , Dr. Azbel has some instructions : // " Depends on you , depends on you . " He tells the story of three people who got together to send a parcel of clothing to aid refuseniks : " So what happened ? One person raised money , the other person bought them , the third person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The KGB . . . . Everybody did his duty , nobody cared. " // On the other hand , he was once visited by a French graduate student who said he would write to him . Azbel just smiled at him , since no letters could get through the KGB censors . But the student returned to France and every day sent Azbel a registered letter , return receipt requested . The letters had small , insignificant messages such as " regards from Alfred , " or newspaper clippings . When he had sent 60 letters , he waited a month , went to the post office , and asked for his insurance money , since he hadn ' t received any receipts indicating Azbel had gotten the letters . The French post office had had trouble before , and was unwilling to ask Moscow for its half of the insurance money , but the graduate student persisted . Since the Soviet Union is loath to part with currency , Azbel figures the KGB censor in charge of his mail was summoned . The letters were opened and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the KGB had no problems " with the letters , and sent them through . " It ' s easier to keep letters than checj them , " Azbel says . He imagines the censor thinking , " ' Who will check the letters this crazy guy receives ? ' The censor did not want to take his chances . So not a single letter from Alfred was lost . I received them , no matter what was written there . So , he conquered. " // A small victory , perhaps , but one that brings a smile of true glee to Azbel ' s face , and , no doubt , sustained him in his time in refusal. " so if you start thinking about you , personally , then it ' s for the whole world . You won ' t change the whole world , but a certain group of people may be shifted , and let them shift others.
