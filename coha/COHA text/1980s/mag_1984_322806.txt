Iran loses a plane , and the war takes an ominous turn <P> When the two Iranian F-4 fighter planes flew over Saudi Arabian territorial waters last week , they seemed to set the stage for yet another attack on a tanker doing business with Iran 's sworn enemy , Iraq . But this time the story was different : the planes were intercepted by two Saudi F-15 fighters firing air-to-air missiles . One , and possibly both , of the Iranian planes was shot down . A short time later , Iran sent eleven more F-4s into the skies over the Persian Gulf . Again , the Saudis intercepted them . After a brief standoff , the Iranian planes withdrew . <P> The engagement signaled an important change in the 45-month-old war between Iran and Iraq . Until now , the Saudis have made every effort to stay out of the war , even though they have given Iraq billions of dollars for weaponry . They have refused to fire back at Iranian planes that for the past month have flown into Saudi airspace in response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing at tankers using Iran 's oil ports . As a result , Iran has been able to count on a big advantage : the determination of Saudi Arabia and the smaller gulf states to stay out of the conflict . Now , it appears , the Saudi policy of nonconfrontation with Iran no longer prevails . <P> Even so , the Saudis made it clear that they had fired their missiles more in sorrow than in anger . Said Prince Bandar ibn Sultan , the Saudi Ambassador to the U.S. : " Our sovereignty was violated and we reacted , as we said we would all along , in a defensive manner . We think it is a pity we had to be dragged into this conflict . " <P> The Saudi-Iranian encounter came during a relative lull in the fighting . At least two more ships were hit during the week . Iraqi Super Etendards swooped down on the Turkish tanker Buyuk Hun in the vicinity of the Iranian oil terminal at Kharg Island ( see box ) . The ship was set ablaze and had to be abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end Iraq " also claimed its warplanes had hit two " naval targets , " otherwise unidentified , near Kharg Island , but the attacks could not be confirmed . <P> Unable to ship their own oil through the besieged gulf , the Iraqis are desperate to find an alternative route that will allow them to replenish their war-drained treasury . It was learned last week that a suggestion had come from an unexpected source : the Israelis . In an interview with the Israeli newspaper Ma'ariv , Prime Yitzhak Shamir revealed that offered to let Iraq pump its oil through long-unused pipeline , built in the 1930s , stretches from Baghdad to the Israeli port of Haifa . Iraq , which does not recognize Israel , rejected the invitation . <P> Because of the growing risk to shipping , the U.S. Navy acknowledged that it had begun to provide protection for tankers chartered to supply fuel for the American naval ships patrolling the gulf . The Reagan Administration is prepared to extend air and naval cover to other vessels if the tanker war should worsen . Under the plan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the western channel of the gulf , through which ships from nonbelligerent nations destined for neutral ports would be escorted . No ships carrying arms or supplies for the warring countries would be included .
