" Let us not fool ourselves that what is happening in Ireland today is any less than disaster for this country and for a dispirited young generation , " said Niall O ' Dowd , an Irish emigrant who is publisher of the Irish America magazine in New York . He estimated that the United States had gained 120 , 000 illegal Irish aliens since 1982 when the latest outflow began. // He addressed a conference on the problem Thursday , urging the Irish to join with Italians , Poles and other national groups to lobby together for an easing of what he warned would prove a " nightmare " of tightened restrictions under the United States ' new immigration law. // " You don ' t even get a farewell party anymore , so many of us are going , " said Richard Flynn , a 17-year-old college student who told his parents two years ago he would leave their homeland as soon as he gets his degree. // The Flynns well understood , for they had been part of the last emigration crisis in the 1950 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their humble farm village of Mohill in rural County Leitrim . Before them , Richard ' s grandmother , Rose , had fled to the United States in the 1920 ' s and come back hopeful. // " My granny came home thinking the family would stay for good , and it hurts us all to see her so cynical now at the age of 85 , " said Richard , one of numerous outward-bound students hitchhiking back to college in Dublin from the depressed farmlands of the west. // The high school or college diploma is the first part of the ticket out for the young , who suffer an unemployment rate of more than 30 percent . Ireland has one of the best education systems in Europe , paid for by one of the most highly taxed and underpaid , underemployed citizenries. // This is the predicament that feeds the flight of the young and presents a far different emigration problem from the historic dispersion from famine 140 years ago when a million Irish migrated in two years. // The official , conservative estimates are that the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to at least 250 , 000 , or 7 percent of the population , by 1992 . This rate , more than a doubling of the emigration rate in the previous couple of decades , would be close to 20 percent of the work force. // But unofficial estimates are that more than 100 , 000 others , the cream of another lost Irish generation , will be moving out as well to the shadow world of illegal residency in the United States in the next five years. // The ways of measuring the outflow include the hard statistics from such typical hinterland areas as Wexford , where 16 percent of the population , the town ' s young heart , has emigrated , most of them in the last two years. // Embarrassingly , the situation also includes the familiar sight of Ireland ' s optimistic advertising poster for business investors . This brags of Ireland being Europe ' s youngest nation and shows a class of eager college graduates on commencement day , most of whom were found by Irish reporters to have later emigrated. // Lately the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , their young generation either departed or reproducing at much lower rates . These predictions are scoffed at by such experts as the Rev. John Gavin , secretary of the Roman Catholic Church ' s Episcopal Commission for Emigrants , who says the birth rate continues to be well ahead of that in the rest of Europe. // Father Gavin discusses the problem more in terms of bad industrial investment policies of the past when overly large multinational corporations were courted , only to leave entire communities devastated when they retreated from the business recession . <> <> Soccer Teams Dwindle // The outflow of the young can also be measured in the dwindling of Irish soccer teams here , with 23 lost in County Clare alone , even as the leagues boom over in America in such renewed Irish communities as Woodside and the North Bronx in New York and Dorchester in Boston. // The young are fleeing unemployment rates running more than twice the average in continental Europe . At the same time , young people in their 20 ' s and 30 ' s , some with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider depressing cultural and religious conditions such as the referendum defeat last year of the proposed legalization of divorce. // " When that was rejected , so many of my friends said , ' That ' s it , I ' m going , ' " said Triona Nic Giolla Choille , a worker with Tide , a social organization that works with emigrants . She spoke in an interview after gently urging the clergy-dominated conference to look at social as well as economic factors underlying the problem. // Church and social work experts at the conference , sponsored by the Commission for Emigrants , agree that until recently successive Irish governments had been denying there was a renewed crisis . The church was already heavily involved in sending priests to serve the Irish in London , the main target port of legal emigrants. // " There ' s such an emotional sense of loss in the collective Irish soul that it ' s very hard to cope with this problem , " said the Rev. Bobby Gilmore , a Catholic chaplain from London ' s swollen Irish neighborhoods . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unemployment and traditional anti-Irish bias as part of the migrants ' challenge . <> <> Bringing Out the Positive // " Historically we had to go so often , to travel , to wander and perhaps to risk , " said the Rev. James A. Kiely , an Irish missionary who returned from seven years in Nigeria to find himself serving his own people in the Hammersmith ghetto in London . " Maybe the challenge of emigration brings out something positive in us , " he said in his London office , where the migrants ' tide increased by more than 50 percent in a year and where he finds some classic immigrants ' toil and progress amid the depressing problems. // Several speakers at the conference , however , accused successive Irish Governments of cynically tolerating emigration as a way of depressing record modern unemployment. // " This country has denied a young generation their right to dream in Ireland , and over 100 , 000 have now hawked their dream to America like millions of Irish before them , " said Mr. O ' Dowd , the publisher. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in the Republic are so engrossed in economic survival that opinion polls find them to have little concern for the traditional problem of the " troubles " in Northern Ireland , where a Catholic minority remains embattled amid the Protestant majority. // Mr. O ' Dowd said the new wave of Irish migrants , once in America , has begun bolstering " hard-line Irish Republicanism , " which the police accuse of sending gunrunning money to Ireland . <> <> ' It ' s the Ferry for Me ' // " This whole island is a myth , " said young Richard Flynn rather bitterly , describing how quickly the new generation is slipping traditional and religious restraints in scrambling toward the future . He said he knew by age 15 that " it ' s the ferry for me. " // " No one tells you , you just know it ' s not feasible to stay , " he said , riding to Dublin , watching the green , sunlit land slip by. // In London , Father Kiely said he finds a different kind of faith among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenging the old order , " he said . " Even if Catholicism survives , the new generation will be Christians by personal commitment. " // Sister Joan Kane , a social worker among the young Irish of London , said the difference is summarized in some popular song lyrics by Liam Reilly. // " It ' s not murder , fear or famine that makes us leave this time , " he wrote , stressing that the young educated emigrants in the latest flow from Ireland feel " we just can ' t throw away these precious years.
