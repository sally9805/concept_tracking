Leo ' s Robert Anthony threw up a " prayer " and came down a winner . Anthony ' s off-balance 20-footer flashed through the nets with one second left Friday night to give the Lions a dramatic 58-56 victory over St. Rita in a battle for first place in the Catholic League . " As soon as I shot the ball , I knew it would go in , " Anthony said . He paused . " I kinda thought it would go in . " If it was not a " Hail Mary " winner , it was a certainly a " Holy Cow " effort and climaxed a game that entertained the 1 , 000 fans crammed into the St. Rita gym . Leo ( 22-2 , 11-1 ) , No. 6 in The Tribune ' s ratings , and No. 11 St. Rita ( 21-4 , 10-2 ) played a close game of give and take on both ends of the court . The Lions held the biggest lead , an 8-point margin at 41-33 with 5 minutes 20 seconds left in the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward Dave Pygon to lead 55-54 on Pygon ' s jumper with 3 : 13 to go in the game . The losing Mustangs threw three different presses at Leo , and when Leo coach Jack Fitzgerald called timeout with 13 seconds left and the game tied at 56 , St. Rita coach Jim Prunty gambled . He moved out of a zone into a man-to- man defense . " I thought we could surprise them and maybe get a five-second call on the inbounds pass , " said Prunty . " We wanted to play aggressively . We didn ' t want them to get the last good shot . " Fitzgerald ' s plan was to get the ball to Randy Doss ( 14 points ) , with Chris Henderson ( 12 points ) and Daryl Arnold ( 18 points ) crashing the boards . " But nothing was open , " said Fitzgerald . " That defensive switch was a good move , yet I feel comfortable any time we go against a man-to-man . " Leo didn ' t play comfortable . St. Rita bottled up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anthony . As the clocked ticked down , Anthony dribbled twice and took that " Holy Cow " shot , the ball swishing through as the clock showed one second to play . Pygon , who led St. Rita with 19 points , 11 in the third quarter , was a star in defeat . It was a bitter loss for Prunty , who has turned around the program at St. Rita in just three years . " We ' ve never been known as a basketball power , " said Prunty . " We haven ' t won a league title in 23 years . We ' re hurting right now , but this was a fans ' game , a coaches ' game and a dream game . " After some early scuffling , Leo took a 35-30 lead at halftime as both teams were hampered by a slippery floor . All the humanity crowded into the small gym had raised the temperature and the humidity . The lead changed hands six times in the final period , and the Mustangs might have been able to take control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of a one-and-one with 1 : 12 to play . Rita ' s Curtis Price hit one of two free throws to tie the game three seconds later.
