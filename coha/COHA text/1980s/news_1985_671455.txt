He finally found N ! Xau ( pronounced En ( click ) ow ) in Botswana . The tiny Bushman had seen only one other white man , a missionary . But because Bushmen are " such nice guys , " Mr. Uys said in a recent New York interview , N ! Xau agreed to fly off in a plane with him and star in the film . Largely because of the Bushman ' s innocent charm , " The Gods Must Be Crazy " is currently the longest running movie now in New York first-run - it opened here last July - and it has achieved enormous popularity both here and in cities throughout the world. // Since 1981 , the film has earned more than $90 million worldwide , including almost $40 million in Japan alone , as well as $11 million in the United States . It has also played in France , Venezuela , Sweden and other countries , and is in its third year in some . This week it will have grossed $1 million at the 68th Street Playhouse without much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , the film ' s earnings at the East Side theater increased from $14 , 796 in the first week to a high of $38 , 000 during Christmas week , and are now running over $20 , 000 each week . Not since " La Cage aux Folles " in 1979 has a foreign movie built an audience in this manner. // The film , which cost $5 million , is a comedy about what happens when a pilot drops an empty Coca-Cola bottle into the Kalahari Desert , and it is found by a Bushman who has never seen such a thing before . The bottle soon becomes an coveted object among a tribe that has always shared everything . So one of the Bushmen ( N ! Xau ) decides to carry the bottle to the end of the earth and throw it off . The film also has several subplots , involving a bumbling microbiologist who collects animal dung ; a female journalist who gives up a high-pressure job in Johannesburg to become a school teacher in the bush and a band of incompetent revolutionaries. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no message , " Mr. Uys said . " I ' ve been making comedies most of my life , and I never put a message in - it ' s bad for business . It ' s arrogant to put messages in . You rob your audiences of putting in their own messages. " // Mr. Uys ( pronounced Ace ) , who has made 22 films , said he got the idea for " The Gods Must Be Crazy " about 12 years ago , while making a film about the animals of the Kalahari Desert . It was there , he said , that he first met the Bushmen and " fell in love with them. " // " After I made the movie , I went back to the Kalahari very often to visit the Bushmen , " he said . " The more I visited the more I discovered this thing about them : They don ' t have a sense of property . They don ' t know about ownership . If I put my jacket down , one of them would put it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing you can own . It seems so different from the rest of us , who will kill one another over a diamond , because of its scarcity value. " // He said he began to wonder how something like a Coca-Cola bottle might become an object the tribe members would want to possess . He picked Coca-Cola , he said , " because it represents our plastic society . " He added that he thought a Coca-Cola bottle " is a beautiful thing , if you ' ve never seen glass before. " // After writing the script , Mr. Uys began his search for the Bushman . " I wanted to meet every Bushman in the world , " he said . Traveling with an interpreter , he visited areas of the Kalahari that he thought might be inhabited by Bushmen , and took photographs of every likely face . " Then we marked the longitude and latitude , so we could find them again. " // He said he knew right away when he had found the right Bushman , N ! Xau . " He ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " The minute I met him , it hit me like a bomb . " He said he then asked the interpreter to ask N ! Xau if he would come and work with them for a bit . " At first he didn ' t understand , because they have no word for work , " Mr. Uys said . " Then the interpreter asked , ' Would you like to come with us for some days ? ' " The Bushman agreed , Mr. Uys said , " because they are such nice guys that when you ask them for something , they say O.K. " N ! Xau handed his bow and arrow to his son , climbed into the plane , and flew with Mr. Uys to Windhoek , the capital of Namibia , which was the base for the filming. // " The airplane didn ' t impress him at all , " Mr. Uys recalled . " He thinks we are magicians , so he believes we can do anything . Nothing impressed him . " In his hotel room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he thought was funny looking , but he refused to sleep on the bed . " He thought he ' d fall off , " Mr. Uys said , " so he slept on the floor. " // The director said N ! Xau was used about 15 weeks during the two years it took to make the movie . He called him " the ideal actor - he thought we were playing and that he was playing along with us . The Bushmen have no television or movies . In the evening they tell a story around the campfire . They act it out . Acting is their whole life. " // Every three or four weeks , N ! Xau would be flown back to his home in the bush , " so he wouldn ' t suffer culture shock , " Mr. Uys said . Still , the Bushman managed to pick up some bad habits . He learned to smoke , " and he loves it , " Mr. Uys said . He also learned to enjoy liquor , especially the sake he was served when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That really worries me , " Mr. Uys said , " because a liquor store has opened in the bush not far from N ! Xau ' s home. " // He said he paid the Bushman $300 for his first 10 days work , then realized it was a mistake , because he has no use for money . " I found out later that the money had blown away , " Mr. Uys said . Next , the Bushman was paid with 12 head of cattle , " because he liked the idea that cattle don ' t run away when you hunt . " Lions killed eight of them , and the Bushmen ate the others hurriedly , Mr. Uys said . He added that he had sent N ! Xau $100 a month for the last few years , which he uses at a new trading store 60 miles from his hunting ground . A $20 , 000 trust account in N ! Xau ' s name has also been established , the director said. // Mr. Uys , who has survived two heart attacks , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beard , and blue eyes covered by a pair of gold-rimmed glasses . He has a shy , somewhat nervous manner , and he kept crossing and recrossing his legs . Finally the reason for some of his discomfort came out : He was trying to give up smoking . Excusing himself , he dashed for the hallway , where he took exactly two puffs on a cigarette . He did this two more times during the interview . " If I smoke out in the hallway , it keeps me from smoking too much , " he explained. // He said that Andrew Steyn , the shy , bumbling microbiologist in " The Gods Must Be Crazy , " was modeled after himself , and that the same character had appeared in his first film 35 years ago . In that film , Andrew was played by Mr. Uys , who has since given up acting . " I used to be awkward like that , especially with women , " he said . " But then I think most young guys knock things over with their first girl. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gods Must be Crazy " has become such a worldwide success . " I wish I knew , because then I could do it again on my next movie , " he said . " There seem to be different reasons in every country . In Japan , the Bushman became a national hero . In France , the microbiologist became a hero . And in America , it ' s a complete mystery to me. " // In South Africa , the film has earned a record $5 million . " I ' m the local boy , " Mr. Uys said . " Everybody grew up on my movies , so I ' ve become a habit . " Asked if blacks in South Africa had supported the film , he replied : " Black people in Africa haven ' t developed a cinema-going habit . Only 10 percent go to the movies regularly. " // Some critics have called Mr. Uys ' s film patronizing to the Bushman . Others have said it presents racial stereotypes while ignoring discrimination in South Africa . The film has been picketed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Lawyers and other anti-apartheid groups. // " I don ' t think the film is patronizing , " Mr. Uys said . " When the Bushman is with us in the city , I do patronize him , because he ' s stupid . But in the desert , he patronizes me , because I ' m stupid and he ' s brilliant. // " The thing about this film , " he added , " is that everybody ' s funny , whether white , black or brown . When you make a comedy , you like to see the funny side of the human condition , and you don ' t see their color. " // Asked his thoughts about apartheid , Mr. Uys replied : " I think it ' s a mess . We ' ve done some silly , naughty things that we ' re ashamed of . We ' re trying to dismantle it , but it ' s a very complicated thing . If you go too slow , it ' s bad , and if you go too fast , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' m not a racist , but everybody likes to think of himself as not racist , and I don ' t think that any of us can swear we ' re not racist . If it means you hate the colored man , I ' m not racist . If it means you choose to marry a girl of your own color , is that racist , too ? If the two are in love , it doesn ' t matter . But I chose a white girl as my wife. " // He said that after his 1965 film , " Dingaka , " was released , some critics who saw the film as being anti-apartheid thought he was a black man and gave the film glowing reviews . The film is about a Masai warrior who defies a tribal taboo and pursues his daughter ' s murderer to Johannesburg . He becomes entangled with the white man ' s justice , is sent to jail and escapes . He finally discovers the real culprit , a witch doctor , and kills him. // Mr. Uys was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers . He and his wife , Hettie , both taught mathematics at the high school level for several years . He got into the film business in 1949 , after his brother wrote that he could borrow a movie camera , and that they should each write a story and shoot it. // Today Mr. Uys says he is " pretty much it " when it comes to films in South Africa . " Everybody else has switched to television , " he said . " I think I ' m the only full-time movie maker , and the only one with international distribution. " // Mr. Uys , who lives in a Johannesburg suburb , has just spent a month in Los Angeles , where he was looking for a film editor and an American actress for the sequel he is writing to " The Gods Must be Crazy . " N ! Xau will be the star , he said , and the actress will portray " a young lady from New York who winds up in the Kalahari. " // A big budget Hollywood film , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempted last year , because so many offers came in , " he said . " But I only use six people on my film crew , and I can ' t see myself working with 300 people . I do everything , the writing , the producing , the camera , the sound , the props . I can ' t delegate . I must be too much of a megalomaniac . " He laughed and ran off for a cigarette. //
