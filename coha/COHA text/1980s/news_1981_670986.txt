Whether it is a historical period - France caught between occupation and liberation in " Lacombe , Lucien " - or a turning point in an individual ' s life - the delicate transition from adolescence to maturity in " Murmur of the Heart " - Mr. Malle says he has always been fascinated by those suspended moments " when something is going to happen and things are not going to be the same . " The result has been elusive , haunting films that have won critical - and a measure of popular - acclaim . Not only have these movies established Mr. Malle as one of the most important film-makers of his generation , but they have also defined , through their simplicity and precision , a unique poetic vision. // Since moving here in 1976 , Mr. Malle has grounded that vision in distinctly American material : " Atlantic City , " which stars Burt Lancaster as an aging associate of mob hit men , describes the anomie that afflicts both the oldtimers and newcomers in that coastal New Jersey town ; and " Pretty Baby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child prostitute whose coming of age coincides with the closing down of the red-light district in turn-of-the-century New Orleans . These films ' concern with history and changing values is hardly incidental , for they reflect Mr. Malle ' s conviction that America embodies the acceleration of history that has taken place in the 20th century. // " One thing that is fascinating to a European is it seems that American economy and society and even psychology are very much for permanent change , " he says in perfect , slightly accented English . " It is striking to see the movement of people here from the Northeast to the Southwest , to see buildings go up that will last 20 years and then be torn down , to see objects that are manufactured to be obsolete in five years . There is still a pioneering spirit here , a basic believing in progress that is probably absent in Europe . If you go to the middle of the country , you still find people looking at their lives in terms of the future instead of the past. " // Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself has no one " view " of America , no European explanation for this curious and sprawling country . Rather , his America - as observed in these two films and a yet-to-be-released documentary on a Minnesota farming community - is a place defined by contradictions he does not attempt to explain . It is a place which still possesses the vitality that he and other young filmmakers in a weary , postwar Europe so admired , a place where nearly every trend in popular culture from CB radios to soap operas originates , and it is a place where a waitress - as played by Susan Sarandon in " Atlantic City " - who aspires to become the first woman croupier in Monte Carlo , can still cherish her Grace Kelly dreams. // Although Mr. Malle ' s camera often focuses on the sleazy - suburban New Jersey with its billboards ; a New Orleans whorehouse with velvet curtains and satin banquettes - there is an odd poetry to his vision , as though the very cheapness of the landscape and its people aspired to something more . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a detachment , a European coolness to his approach which instead of moralizing admits a certain ambiguity of perception . " It ' s not what you look at , but the way you look at it , " says Mr. Malle . " Maybe ' Atlantic City ' expresses a point of view that is slightly different - I think I look at things other people who are more familiar with the scene might pass by. " // Wry , articulate and boyishly charming , Mr. Malle at 48 combines the confidence of a professional who is sure of his craft with the introspection of a man who thinks of himself as a chronic outsider . He is a romantic , who believes that art can force people to reconsider their comfortable assumptions , but he is also a realist wary of self-indulgence in his art . He says he was well aware of the risks of coming to America to work. // In addition to the difficulties of directing in a foreign language - a factor less pressing in Mr. Malle ' s case , given his fluency in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of audiences to contend with . " I would say mass audiences in this country are more puritanical than in Europe , " he says . " And they probably want more to be able to identify with what ' s going on on the screen . It ' s really sort of a subtle balance between identification and wish-fulfillment . The key to a number of successful movies recently has been some sort of projection of the American Dream - an ideal vision of a world where life is easier than it is in actuality . It is more difficult to get audiences interested here in hardcore naturalism. " // Over the years , though , Mr. Malle had spent a considerable amount of time visiting this country , and he says he felt confident that he " knew more about this country than most Europeans . " What perhaps surprised him the most about actually working in America was the relatively diminished status of the director here and the emphasis on commercial success . " It ' s probably more difficult working here than in France , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ' ll give a director carte blanche , and if they do it ' s because your last picture has been tremendously successful at the box office , not because you ' ve made good films. // " During the last 20 years in Europe , film has been recognized as art . I ' m not sure this step has been reached here . It ' s possible in Europe to be a successful artist without necessarily being extremely successful commercially . Here , it ' s basically much more in the hands of accountants - there is an obsession with the hit , the blockbuster , which means the ultimate goal is for you to come up with a picture that will please everybody . I ' ve always worked the opposite way . I ' ve been more interested in - not in displeasing people , but in disturbing , provoking them . I want to force them to ask questions. " // Over the years , many of Mr. Malle ' s films have proved controversial indeed . His second feature film " The Lovers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 , created something of a succes de scandale when it won a special prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1958 . Portraying a woman who leaves her husband for a young lover , it was condemned by censors for what were then regarded as dangerously explicit sex scenes. // " Murmur of the Heart , " released in 1971 , was similarly provocative . Essentially the story of a young boy ' s coming of age , the film offered a delicate indictment of the bourgeois values of the grown-up world , but achieved notoriety for its depiction of sexual passion between mother and son . Its light , humorous treatment of such controversial subjects as incest , masturbation and infidelity confirmed , for many Americans at least , an image of the French taste for naughty sophistication. // A darker and more disturbing image of France surfaced in Mr. Malle ' s next film , " Lacombe , Lucien , " a dispassionately told story about a 17-year-old French peasant boy who casually , almost haphazardly , slips into collaboration with the Germans during the final days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supreme ordinariness of evil , and while it won much critical praise , it was also attacked in France by both the Left and Right. // If these movies shared an ability to disturb , they seemed to many critics , to have little else in common , and in retrospect , Mr. Malle ' s career seems to consist of several curious zigzags , ranging from such somber , closely observed works as " Le Feu Follet " - a study of the last 48 hours in a suicide ' s life - to such extravagantly comic exercises as " Zazie dans le Metro , " a sort of slapstick farce about a young girl who goes on a sightseeing tour of the Paris underworld . As the director points out , however , both films were partly aminated by a concern with the corruption of innocence - a theme he has examined in many of his movies . In fact if the subjects of his films often seem widely disparate , there remain certain dominant motifs , certain recognizable preoccupations. // His women , the director observes , tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are dreamers , rebelling against the conventions of their lives . Jeanne Moreau , who runs off with her boyfriend in " The Lovers " ; Lea Massari , who seduces her son in " Murmur of the Heart " ; and Susan Sarandon , who drives off into the sunset with a cache of cocaine-earned money in " Atlantic City " - these are all determined , emotional individuals , although in the end they are frequently defeated ones as well. // His men , on the other hand , are often adolescents - if not in age , then by temperament . To them , growing up means the loss of innocence and initiation into another world , a world of duplicity and compromise . Maurice Ronet as the suicide victim in " Le Feu Follet " - a film Mr. Malle made at the age of 30 , " that very depressing stage when you have to accept you are an adult " - for instance , is a dissipated playboy , who has outlived his boyish enthusiasms and wasted his youthful charm . Pierre Blaise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his own unthinking " innocence , " and 14-year old Laurent played by Benoit Ferreux in " Murmur of the Heart , " hovers on the edge of maturity , confronted with the realization that like everyone else he , too , faces life alone. // Nearly all of Mr. Malle ' s characters , in fact , are afflicted by loneliness and solitude . The hero in his first film " Ascenseur pour l ' Echafaud " murders his lover ' s husband , then is trapped by himself in an elevator ; he and his mistress are never even seen together on the screen . " Vie Privee , " a 1962 film starring Brigitte Bardot as a Bardot-like actress , was a study of the isolating consequences of fame ; " Le Feu Follet " portrayed the despair of a man who realizes he has never touched or been touched by anybody , even his closest friends ; and " Atlantic City " depicts a set of solitary people whose lives are momentarily brightened by their chance encounters with strangers. // " It ' s always sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his characters . " It ' s like an evil or a disease or something you don ' t especially choose to be . I believe the best part of your work has to be unconscious . It ' s not a conscious preoccupation for me to expose loneliness in my films - it just happens that way . If I end up with a series of characters with a sense of being cut off , it has to do with my own situation . When I was in my teens , I was very much of a loner and not by choice . It was something in my nature and everything I ' ve been doing since has been trying to reconcile myself with other human beings. " // The youngest son of a wealthy sugar family , Louis Malle grew up in surroundings similar to those depicted in " Murmur of the Heart . " It was a rigid world , he recalls , a world " with all the advantages of money and education and a lot of hypocrisy . " There was a strict Catholic education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one school , he says , for arguing about the true existence of Christ - followed by matriculation at the University of Paris , where his parents wanted him to study political science . Mr. Malle , however , had already decided that he wanted to make movies and he soon transferred to the Institut des Hautes Etudes Cinematographiques. // Filmmaking , he had discovered , was a kind of therapy for him . In the first place , his apprenticeship with Jacques Cousteau - Mr. Malle co-directed the underwater documentary " The Silent World " - introduced him to people far removed from the rarified world of the upper bourgeoisie and it forced him to interact . " Dealing with Cousteau ' s people I was suddenly seeing real people , " he recalls . " I was this sort of intellectual , abstract-thinking , spoiled rich kid , and they gave me a hard time . They probably saved my life. " // What ' s more , the very process of making films , it seemed to him , provided a way out of the hermetic realm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it meant turning the lens of self-scrutiny outward to the world at large . " The fact you go out there with a camera forces you into a relationship with the world , " he says , " It forces you to look and to listen more than if you didn ' t have that thing to do . But weirdly enough , as soon as you put observing as your occupation , it forces you to stand outside - it isolates you further . It ' s taken a long time to make my peace with it - whether it ' s a documentary or fiction , you feel that you ' re using people , that you ' re somehow taking advantage. " // That sense of being a voyeur , a surreptitous observer of others , was instilled in Mr. Malle during his early years with Cousteau - years when he spent hours filming underwater , " where the gravity is different , where your senses function differently . " And it was reinforced further in 1967 , when he went to India to make his awardwinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filming people who were afraid that the camera would steal their souls. // Apparently the experience of working in an alien culture also caused Mr. Malle to re-examine all that he had once taken for granted and it would be reflected in a cinematic style focused increasingly on the ambiguities of truth . " India was a turning point in my life , " he says now . " It made me realize there is always a different way of looking at things . I no longer believe like some people there are certain truths ; I believe there is a truth only at a certain place and a certain moment. " // The trip to India also renewed Mr. Malle ' s sense of artistic purpose , for he had left France feeling " tired of actors , studios , fiction and Paris . " He had begun to feel that his work was becoming staid and repetitious - " if I went on that way I worried I ' d end up becoming part of the Academie Fran , caise " - and his position within the Paris film establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as provocateur . Ten years later , just prior to coming to America , a similar sense of stagnation had begun to bother him. // Although " Murmur of the Heart " and " Lacombe , Lucien " both won high critical acclaim , " Black Moon " - a surreal parable about an Alice-in-Wonderland-type character , which was released in 1975 - was criticized as being somewhat obscure , and Mr. Malle worried that his work " was becoming a little byzantine , a little too esoteric . " In addition , both " Lacombe , Lucien " and " Black Moon " were filmed near his home in the isolated countryside of southwest France , and the director says he was starting to feel removed from the mainstream of life. // So in 1976 , Mr. Malle moved to America to start filming " Pretty Baby , " and has lived here ever since . He recently completed " My Dinner with Andre , " a short film which stars the playwright and actor Wallace Shawn and the avant-garde director Andre Gregory playing versions of themselves , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fall . There are also plans for another feature-length film set in the suburbs of America. // " I needed to renew the fire and that ' s what I did coming here - in my work and in my life , " says Mr. Malle . " Living here has given me a sense of threat - in France , I was sort of a prima donna - and I liked this challenge very much . Coming to America , I had this very strong feeling it was like starting from scratch , like going back to your first years when you were young. " // Today Mr. Malle and his wife , the actress Candice Bergen , whom he married last year , live in a lovely , light-filled apartment overlooking Central Park . For Mr. Malle , it is a happy and wonderfully unexpected development . " I ' ve never been so close to anybody , " he says . " For the first time , it is a chance to share everything . It doesn ' t take away a sense of isolation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re alone to be the two of you . It ' s something I didn ' t believe would happen to me. " // " I think to be an artist , you must keep a kind of rage inside of you , " he goes on softly . " It just happens that I am very happy these days in my personal life , but in my work - which is my relationship with the world - I would like to keep this sense of indignation , this sense this is not the way things should be. " //
