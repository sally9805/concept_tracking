The thought may make you blanch , but this month next year we will be inaugurating a new president . The paleness will come from looking at the present candidates for the job , not an impressive lot . The prediction , though , is unassailable . The Constitution forbids Mr. Reagan ' s continuing , even if you wanted him to , and mandates that someone else take on the job , ready or not . Whoever the somebody is , he  --  a she isn ' t in the cards this year  --  will inherit a peck of woes . Every president since George Washington has had to deal with problems left by his predecessor . Some he resolves , some not . He in turn leaves the unresolved to his successor , and so on ad infinitum . Indeed , in modern times only President Dwight Eisenhower left behind no new problems of his own creation . The next president , like the present one , will acquire a government whose finances are a mess and also , no doubt , a Congress little disposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will face troubles all over the world , from Latin America to the Persian Gulf . The one thing he can count on is lots of advice  --  from the political leaders of the opposition party , from experts in economics or foreign affairs , and of course from journalists everywhere , editorial writers and columnists of every political persuasion . Those without responsibility always see solutions unperceived by those with the responsibility for carrying them out . Advice on important matters of national or world affairs I will confidently leave to George Will , William Safire , William Buckley , James J. Kilpatrick and others . But I will venture now one small suggestion for this next president . This has to do with dealing with the press . That ' s been a baffling and frustrating business for every president since Jack Kennedy . It made life miserable for Lyndon Johnson , Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter . For Richard Nixon it was a disaster . For Ronald Reagan , press conferences have been unwelcome chores despite his skill as the " great communicator . " My small suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt , the master . Mr. Roosevelt , you ' ll remember , held twice-weekly press conferences until the coming of World War II . That kept the press corps happy until the conferences ' frequency reached the level of boredom , at which point attendance became a chore and attendance dropped to a mere handful of reporters . Of course , the next president , unlike FDR , can ' t make them off the record . First radio and then television made that impossible . That means the president can ' t just " think out loud " without worrying about the exact wording of every answer . And when confronted with a dumb question ( not unknown now ) , he dare not tell the reporter publicly it was a stupid question and to go stand in the dunce corner , although it might be worth trying . I suspect the watching public might applaud . This little suggestion , I doubt not , will strike terror in the presidential breast . Every press conference these days is an agonizing experience for the man in the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all clamoring for attention and eager to put the " killer " question , all in the glare of television lights with the whole world watching . To suffer this twice a week or even once a week sounds like an unbearable horror . That is , until you think through the suggestion . When press conferences are held infrequently , many things have happened in the world and the reporters come armed with many questions . Infrequency also makes them television " events , " which every network feels compelled to carry no matter what other programs must be canceled . Frequency , I suspect , would change everything . What can a reporter ask on Thursday he didn ' t ask on Tuesday ? The world rarely changes that much in so short a time . To the repeated question the president need only reply , " I answered that last time . Next question . " And it will be a lot harder to think up new questions . Moreover , consider the TV networks . It ' s one thing for them to cancel their commercial programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or worse , twice a week ? And what of the TV audience if the networks did do that ? My guess is that it would shrink rapidly . Doubtless the cameras would remain and use a lot of tape , but whatever nuggets turned up could be handled on the nightly news programs . What I am talking about is the effect of the boredom factor . The president would become bored with press conferences ( which is better than being tense about them ) just as FDR became . So would the TV audience , if indeed the TV networks even bothered with them . Most of all , reporters would get bored once the conferences ceased being " events . " Soon Washington bureau chiefs would have to assign reporters to go , willing or not , just as they had to do back in the Roosevelt days . There were times , I remember , when there would be no more than 15 or 20 reporters present instead of the hordes who gather these days . Maybe once again press conferences could be held in the Oval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an auditorium . There also should be some side benefits from frequent press conferences . There ' d be no excuse then for all the ill-mannered hollering by reporters every time the president walks from the White House to his waiting helicopter . At the very least , that ' s undignified treatment of the nation ' s chief executive . It also tempts the president to make off-the-cuff replies that can be embarrassing and often require " clarification " from White House spokesmen . So , all in all , I hope the next president will consider this small suggestion . It would bring him considerable benefit . The White House press corps would have little to complain of . He would have a more orderly way of communicating his thoughts to the public . About the only drawback I can think of is that those frequent press conferences would drive some of the more aggressive White House reporters wild with ennui.  --  - Mr. Royster is editor emeritus of the Journal.                   @ @
