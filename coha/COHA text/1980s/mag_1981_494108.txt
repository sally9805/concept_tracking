During Sylvia Plath 's short life of just over 30 years , she saw only one book of her poems published : The Colossus ( 1960 ) . She had prepared a second one , even worked out the order of its poems , and that appeared as Ariel in 1965 after her death , with a number of poems added which were written in her final months . Two further volumes were published posthumously : Crossing the Wafer ( 1971 ) , containing mainly earlier poems , and Winter Trees , in the same year , containing 18 late ones plus " Three Women , " a lugubrious " poem for three voices " written for the BBC . The result of such piecemeal , though perhaps advisable , publication was to create confusion in our minds about those remarkable seven years ( 1956-1963 ) in which 224 poems were written and finished . Now , 18 years after her death by suicide in February 1963 , we are at last given a thoroughly responsible presentation of the poems in chronological order , more than a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old volume titles have been dropped , and poems are soldiers from opening their closed socie simply grouped under their appropriate year , dated by month and day whenever possible . The result is to make her appear an altogether larger and more satisfying poet than this reader had taken her to be . Reading these poems through in chronological order calls into question the received idea of the clever craftswoman producing beautifully shaped objects , almost too beautifully shaped , who suddenly achieved a " breakthrough " into ? in the phrase of one of that book 's reviewers ? the " raw genius " of the later , Ariel poems . You could even read it as a lesson in liberation , with the early volume coming at the end of those evil 1950s ( and she went to Smith too ! ) and the later one heralding , along with Robert Lowell and Anne Sexton and lesser talents , a confessional freedom from the repressive , whether prosodic or personal : What a thrill My thumb instead of an onion . ? " Cut " Dying Is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . I do it so it feels like hell . ? " Lady Lazarus " Never mind that in both poems , as in so many of her other late ones , there was not only a bitter but a mockingly self-lacerating and playful wit , a pure revel in felicities of language ( " My thumb instead of an onion " ? some fun there after you get through wincing ) which the desperateness of her running-out life somehow gave birth to . Too many readers , younger ones especially , approached these later poems with religious awe as if " Sylvia " ( or as they would now say , " Plath " ) were to be treated in a manner befitting Jesus Christ ; it was she who had died for our sins ? so the distressed young student might feel , especially if female . Of course the backlash was n't long in corning . One college newspaper in the early 1970s printed 24 Sylvia Plath jokes , grisly riddles the mildest of which by far went " Why did SP cross the road ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ted Hughes has done an exemplary job in editing these poems , writing notes to them year by year ( one only wishes for more notes , since they are so interesting ) , and giving us a generous selection of the juvenilia pre-1956 poems . And he strikes the right note in his introduction when he remarks that her attitude to her verse was artisan-like : if she could n't get a table out of the material , she was quite happy to get a chair , or even a toy . The end product for her was not so much a successful poem , as something that had temporarily exhausted her ingenuity . The right note , for surely she was one of the most ingenious poets in this latter half of our century ; and to speak of her in terms of artisan and chair-maker , rather than transmitter of pure inspiration from heaven upstairs or downstairs hell , does justice to her resourcefulness and skill as a maker . She did not always do justice to herself in this respect ; or rather , she sometimes spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compatible . For example , this remark made about " Point Shirley , " a poem she completed in January of 1959 : " Oddly powerful and moving to me in spite of rigid formal structure. - " Point Shirley " was written at the time she had begun to attend ( along with Anne Sexton and George Starbuck ) Robert Lowell 's writing seminar at Boston University , and the poem 's debt to Lowell 's work is evident . But consider its opening two stanzas , in which her grandmother 's house is evoked : From Water-Tower Hill to the brick prison The shingle booms , bickering under The sea 's collapse . Snowcakes break and welter This year The gritted wave leaps The seawall and drops onto a bier Of quahog chips , Leaving a salty mash of ice to whiten In my grandmother 's sand yard . She is dead , Whose laundry snapped and froze here , who Kept house against What the sluttish , rutted sea could do . Squall waves once danced Ship timbers in through the cellar window ; A thresh-tailed , lanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements She wore her broom straws to the nub . This may have been , as her biographer Edward Butscher says it was , a deliberate attempt to capture Lowell 's seaside grays ; but the strict stanza , the rhymes and half-rhymes , above all the careful syntax and enjambed lines ? even running over from one stanza to the next ? show an attention to ( in Frost 's words ) " the sound of sense " that is compelling and demanding of any reader 's agility . The continuations and suspensions which the speaking voice must make to navigate these lines are surely central to the poem 's power . If we may correct Sylvia Plath , it moves us not in spite of but partly because of its " rigid formal structure . " And it is quite different from anything Lowell had done in Lord Weary 's Castle ? where the blank verse proceeds in a breathless , hurtling way ? or was doing in Life Studies , which appeared in 1959 . During the preceding two years , Plath had grown extremely skilled at rendering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read for the first time . Here is the opening of " The Great Carbuncle " ( 1957 ) : We came over the moor-top Through air streaming and green-lit , Stone farms foundering in it , Valleys of grass altering In a light neither of dawn Nor nightfall , our hands , faces Lucent as porcelain , the earth 's Claim and weight gone out of them . And it continues just as expertly . Imagine deciding , as evidently she did , that such a poem was not quite good enough to be included in her first book ! When she spoke ( in another remark quoted by Hughes ) with respect to the admirable " Mushrooms " ( which did make The Colossus ) of " my absolute lack of judgment when I 've written something : whether it 's trash or genius , " she spoke with her characteristic eitherlor absoluteness . But " The Great Carbuncle , " or " Above the Oxbow " ( here my Connecticut River sentimentality may be intruding ) , or " In Midas ' Country , " or " Child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or " Green Rock , Winthrop Bay " are not trash ? perhaps not genius either , but something else , less sensational : assured performances , with a technical control wholly adequate to sustain the observant , grave , responsive presence that makes itself felt audibly over the carefully tracked course of stanza and whole poem . John Frederick Nims said it succintly when he suggested that young writers should be advised to " forget Ariel for a while ; study The Colossus . " With the new volume , this study can more intelligently take place . If she could only " let things slip a bit , " said a reviewer in admiration of her earlier poems , she will do something really special . What happened in fact was that she let them slip with a vengeance into the " stream of repulsions " ( the phrase is Hugh Kenner 's ) that inform the poems from the last months of her life . Ted Hughes left her in October of 1962 . During that month she wrote or finished 25 poems , including the ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new to me , " The Detective , " we read on through , among others , the bee poems , " The Applicant , " " Daddy , " " Medusa , " " Lesbos , " " Fever 103 ? , " " Cut , " and " Lady Lazarus . " Much adjectival overkill has been employed by reviewers attempting in desperation of vocabulary to outdo the poems themselves , and George Steiner , never at a loss on such occasions , has referred to " Daddy " as the " Guernica of modern poetry . " But really it is nothing of the sort , reading now like a very clever , very nasty , very hopeless horror song which holds us partly by its resourceful way of exploiting our reticence and embarrassment at what we are hearing : I have always been scared of you , With your Luftwaffe , your gobbledygoo . And your neat mustache And your Aryan eye , bright blue . Panzer-man , panzer-man , 0 You Poor Otto Plath , a diabetic professor of biology at Boston University who had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so double-crossed his daughter by dying too soon , scarcely deserves such a tribute ( I know , it 's really a myth ) . And the stanza , indeed the whole poem , contains much that is repellent about Plath 's poetry : the clever " gobbled ygoo , " a word like the one English teachers used to write on freshman themes ; the relentless caricaturing of another , in tough baby-talk , all done in the interests of " art . " And the panzer-man repetition . Earlier in " Daddy " we hear that " The tongue stuck in my jaw " : " It stuck in a barb wire snare. ) lch , ich , ich , ich , " and the poet 's tongue sticks also in " Elm " ( " These are the isolate slow faults ) That kill , that kill , that kill " ) , in " The Bee Meeting " ( " They will not smell my fear , my fear , my fear " ) , in " The Applicant , " and elsewhere . There are many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " whose tongue really is n't stuck at all , but extraordinarily adept and daring in its leaps and spins ; like the one done around the first line of " Lady Lazarus , " " Dying is an art " : I do it so it feels like hell . I do it so it feels real . I guess you could say I 've a call . It 's easy enough to do it in a cell . It 's easy enough to do it and stay put . It 's the theatrical Comeback in broad day To the same place , the same face , the same brute Amused shout : ' A miracle ! ' That knocks me out . A brilliant show , but there may be a problem about how many times one wants to watch it again . That is why encountering it here , as poem #198 in a chronological sequence , is a very good thing for its continued life . She had done , could do so much with words ; now she had to do this , would do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to say , " There is a charge ... a very large charge/ For a word or a touch ) Or a bit of blood . " The sad joke is that the reader ? surrounded by all those other poets in the imaginary museum who can be summoned up in a twinkling for a performance ? really does n't have to pay very much to watch the show . It was Sylvia Plath who paid the charge in full , and one feels in reading the final 12 poems in this collection , those written in the month and the days of 1963 which preceded her death , form a sort of coda , or perhaps a rehearsal for a new part to be played somewhere else . The mood is set by the bleakly wonderful " Sheep in Fog " ( " My bones hold a stillness , the far ! Fields melt my heart " ) and holds largely through until the last poem , " Edge , " in which " The woman is perfected. / Her dead/ Body wears the smile of accomplishment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Balloons , " a touching surprise after the histrionic agonies of more sensational Plath-poems . For four stanzas , composed with that fluidity of motion she had grown so expert at achieving years before , these " Guileless and clear , / Oval soul-animals " are celebrated for being themselves , for living with the mother and her children since Christmas , for keeping them company . Two last stanzas address the daughter : Your small Brother is making His balloon squeak like a cat . Seeming to see A funny pink world he might eat on the other side of it , He bites , Then sits Back , fat jug Contemplating a world clear as water . A red Shred in his little fist , This was finished a week before she died , and unlike the balloons it remains with us , in its own words Delighting The heart like wishes or free Peacocks blessing Old ground with a feather Beaten in starry metals . For years I have endorsed Irving Howe 's limiting judgment of Sylvia Plath as an " interesting minor poet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection is likely to be comfortable with that judgment . She was rather , was indeed ? as the expression goes ? something else .
