Ron Burke sat 30 rows above the ice , trying to appear relaxed . Below , the Canadian and U.S. Olympic hockey teams played out the final four minutes of an exhibition game . The Canadians led 5-4 , but Team USA was on a power play , peppering the Canadian goaltender  --  Sean Burke  --  with hard shots . Ron was in danger of overdosing on vicarious thrills . // Sean , his oldest son , had replaced Andy Moog in goal 10 minutes into the second period  --  after Team USA had gone ahead 4-2 . Feigning indifference might help Ron through this tense time , so he talked about the Blue Jays : " This is not to put down George Bell , but if Tony Fernandez does n't break his wrist , I think he 's  --  oooh ! " // Corey Millen , Team USA 's lightning-quick center , had beaten a defender and was skating in on Sean alone . Point-blank , Millen stuffed the puck between the goalie 's pads . A skate save . Ron pretended not to notice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's got to be your MVP , eh ? You know . Sean was quite a shortstop . See how he uses his glove hand ?  --  ohh ! " It was Millen again , this time penetrating the Canadian four-man shell , bearing down on Burke  --  30 feet , 20 , 15 .... But when Millen finally cocked the hammer it was to fake a slap shot . Then , in a blur , he slid a backdoor pass to a line mate who shot at the half-empty goal . But the puck found the leather of Burke 's leg pad , not the mesh of the net . As Millen was passing to his teammate , Burke bolted across the crease and kicked . Millen lay on the ice , pounding it with frustration . Final score : 5-4. // Among those filing out of Copps Coliseum in Hamilton , Ont. , was a rangy lawyer and ex-NHL goaltender who could not shake the memory of Burke 's kick save . " You see saves like that , where someone makes a desperate lunge  --  waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puck , " said Ken Dryden . " But usually you get a sense of it having been just that , desperate . This was no panicked lunge . There was something very solid about it . They gave the MVP to someone else , but there was no question Burke was the difference in that game . " // Afterward , a bevy of Burke family members and friends from Dovercourt , Ont. , waited for him outside the Coliseum . Burke , who has just turned 21 , is insightful , with an ego that 's blessedly modest . The media had surrounded his locker for 25 minutes , so he was among the last Canadians out  --  a point his grandmother , Katherine , noted in scolding tones . // Ron Burke was a sandlot pitcher who says he could have had a career in baseball had he not torn muscles in his back , then tried to play through the pain . Instead , he was so tough he played himself out of the game . He has a simple explanation for his son 's prowess in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hockey . " // His hockey . An ironic choice of pronoun , since Sean Burke plays their hockey : Ron 's and Katherine 's and all of Dovercourt 's . " You play for your teammates and your friends and family , for everyone who showed up at the games or gave me a ride  --  everyone who was a part of it , " says Sean . " I could stop playing today , never go any further in hockey , and they would still be proud of me. " // Because he is tall  --  6 ' 3 "  --  like Dryden , and hails from the Toronto area , like Dryden , comparisons between Burke and the former Montreal Canadien star are inevitable . They crumble just under the surface , however . Dryden grew up in upper-middle-class Islington , arriving in the NHL via Cornell University . Burke is from Dovercourt , a sooty neighborhood of row houses in the shadow of Toronto 's central business district  --  " If you ca n't fight , it helps if you have a few extra sandwiches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest from Michigan , Michigan State . Yale , Harvard and Princeton , but elected to skip college to accelerate his journey to the NHL . He is on loan to Team Canada from the New Jersey Devils , who picked him second in the 1985 entry draft . // When Edmonton Oiler holdout Moog joined the Olympic team last fall , the assumption was that he would be Canada 's best bet in Calgary . But Burke 's performance has clouded the decision for Canadian Olympic coach Dave King . Through Dec. 29 , Moog 's goals-against average was 3.83 , Burke 's 2.92 for Canada 's pre-Olympic games . And as King points out , " Even though Andy has played in the NHL for so long , Sean is the veteran when it comes to international hockey . " Burke has been on Canada 's national team since ' 86. // King remembers scouting Burke when he was a 17-year-old rookie with the Toronto Marlboros Junior A team . " He would be brilliant one night and just ordinary the next , " King says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lets a goal in , instead of losing his temper , he 'll freeze , look at the right post , the left post , his angle , his position  --  all to make sure he does n't make the same mistake twice . " // Tuning out the extraneous was something Burke learned early . His mother and father separated when Sean was " eight or nine . " Sally Burke raised Sandra . 20 , and Brian , 18 ; Ron raised Sean and Christine , who is now 16 . That Sean even made it to his games in Squirt , Pee-wee , Bantam , Midget and Junior B leagues is amazing , considering Ron has never had a car . He owned a fast-food restaurant in Dovercourt but sold it after his divorce and used the money to help raise the children . // Sean would get home from school , pack his equipment bag and go to the bus stop . He preferred to be at the rink an hour and a half early . " That was a little much , " says Ron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to discourage that kind of behavior . " Oblivious of the diesel fumes and of the stares of commuters struck by the sight of an eight-year-old lugging a duffel bag bigger than he was , Sean , on his long commutes , would imagine himself making crucial saves . That did n't make him much different from the other goalies his age . Except that a couple of hours later , he would actually make those saves . // " I remember when he was 14 , and at St. Michael 's , " says Dan McLean , a family friend . " The Toronto Nationals had the best Junior Bantam team in all of Ontario . They came down and Sean just put on a show . Stood on his head . They beat the Nats 4-1. " // By high school Burke was an outstanding prospect , and so many people told him about it that he could have cultivated a swollen head . That he did not can probably be attributed to his attending St. Michael 's , a Toronto school run by Basilian fathers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars as Frank and Pete Mahovlich , former Syracuse University basketball star Leo Rautins and welterweight Shawn O'Sullivan  --  Burke was just another jock . " The Basilians did n't care if you had made 50 saves on Thursday night , if you did n't have your homework Friday morning , " says Sean . // Burke beat out Finnish-import Timo Lehkonen for the starting goaltender 's job with the Marlboros in 1984 , started 49 of 65 games and was named the team 's MVP . Selected to play for Canada in the Pravda Cup in Moscow in 1986 , Burke shut out the Soviet B team for a period . " This is great ! " he remembers thinking . " We 're playing in Russia , and I 'm shutting them out ! I 've got this game licked ! " Then the Soviets scored 10 goals in the next 40 minutes . // " That was a rude awakening , but healthy . I realized then that I would not make it on natural ability alone , " says Burke . " There 's still a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burke has proved himself to be an apt student . Last December he returned to Moscow and helped lead Team Canada to its first Izvestia Cup title in the 21-year history of the tournament . He also was selected as the best goaltender in the six-country , round-robin competition . // Burke spends his summers working for $150 ( Canadian ) a week at the Dovercourt Boys Club , a three-minute walk from home . He could make at least twice as much money teaching at a hockey school , but he prefers to come home to the old neighborhood . It 's his way of repaying the community for all those rides home from games . // So , what will happen in Calgary ? Says Burke , " I have personal goals , but they 're , well , personal . " // " He does n't want to tell me what they are , " says Ron . " He 's afraid I 'll think he 's bragging. " // One safe guess : Sean Burke wants an Olympic medal . Then , after the Games , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and half of Dovercourt will be waiting for him . Some will just beam ; some will want to touch the medal . His grandmother will remark on how late the plane was . Then they 'll all take the bus back to the neighborhood .
