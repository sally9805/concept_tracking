When the final gavel thumped down at the auction up at John Connally 's 7,300- acre spread near Floresville , Texas , last Saturday , 126 of his prized Thoroughbreds and quarter horses had been sold off for nearly $400,000 . Two of the latter were the progeny of a proud champion , Dash for Cash . The . stallion 's name was apt , for the auction came at a time when Connally himself is making a run for money . Numerous creditors are pursuing the former Texas Governor and U.S. Treasury Secretary for millions in unpaid loans on a host of flailing ventures . Connally , a man as outsize as Texas itself , is in the same predicament as the state where he has always stood tall : he needs the cash or his overextended business will be dashed . <P> After Connally , 69 , failed to get out of the starting gate for the 1980 G.O.P. presidential nomination , he returned home with the idea of becoming what Texans call " big rich . " He was already worth about $6 million  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no end to the twin booms in oil and real estate , and aimed to parlay his connections and powerful salesmanship into serious money . <P> He formed a partnership with his protege , Ben Barnes , 48 , a former Lieutenant Governor . With an initial investment of about $5 million apiece , the two men borrowed millions more to finance the construction of office buildings , shopping centers and luxury condos . Bankers practically threw money at them , and the two supremely confident former politicians readily signed personal guarantees for a variety of construction loans . " He was so persuasive and charming he could make you believe day was night , " says Roger Chapman , a former business partner . In just three years Connally and Barnes built up their assets to a high of $300 million . <P> But as oil dropped from $32 a barrel to $9 , the Texas economy went dry  --  and just about everything that Connally and Barnes touched turned bad . Their $14 million , 14-story office building in Houston , 80% vacant , was foreclosed on and sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condominiums in Ruidoso Downs , N. Mex. , is the target of a foreclosure suit . More than a quarter of the 212 lots in Austin 's plush estates of Barton Creek sit unsold . A creditor has sued to foreclose on four shopping centers ; a fifth has already been lost . <P> Altogether , Connally and Barnes owe at least $60 million and have been hammered with a score of lawsuits charging nonpayment of loans . " Connally has gone through the same predicament that a lot of Texans are going through , " says a fellow Texan and friend , former Democratic Party Chairman Robert Strauss . They " bet too much . They believed the trees were going to grow to the sky . " <P> Connally , who grew up poor on a hardscrabble farm in Floresville , is said to be worried , but determined to tough it out . That is no surprise coming from the man who was wounded during the assassination of John F. Kennedy in Dallas in 1963 and then went on to become a power in the Republican Party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Connally told aides recently , " it 's not as bad as being shot through the chest . " He and Barnes have been jetting around the world to drum up cash , because Texas , says Barnes , " is capital-poor now . "
