In case you think the technology craze in the stock market has even come close to running its course - think again . The hunger of the institutional biggies to be tops in the " performance game " - to outshine the competition and maybe snare one of those lucrative pension fund accounts from the market laggards - is forcing the money- management fraternity to continue to play technology stocks with vigor even though many of them have doubled and tripled during the 10 1/2 - month market surge . The Franklin Group of Funds , a San Mateo , Calif. money management firm running $2.8 billion of assets , typifies this thinking . " The technology stocks are overpriced , " Franklin president Charlie Johnson told me at breakfast in San Francisco the other day . " But I also thought they were overpriced in ' 69 after they ran up 100 percent in ' 68 . So what did they do ? They ran up another 100 percent after that . " You ' ve got to buy technology now . If you don ' t - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your face ; it ' s that simple . " Johnson ' s putting his money where his mouth is ; 20 cents of every equitydollar is going into technology . Among his top choices for purchase right now : Intel , M/A-Com , InteCom , KLA and Intermedics . Clearly , though , a lot of the easy money in technology is gone . And that means greater selectivity than ever is called for . Even the technology bulls admit that this sector - given any general market setback - is easily vulnerable to stiff individual stock price declines of 20 percent to 30 percent , considering the previous runup . And so the question : What ' s the smartest way to play technology now ? For some answers , I picked the brains of one of the country ' s savviest technology investment minds - 39-year-old James Berdell . Berdell , up until last August , was a fella with big clout . A technology analyst for 15 years - most recently at San Francisco- based Montgomery Securities - favorable or unfavorable words from Berdell on a technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also had a great knack for picking winning technology stocks in the early stages - companies like Intel , ROLM , Advanced Micro- Devices , Cray Research and Network Systems ; a number of them shot up 10 times after Berdell ' s recommendation . For the past 11 months , Berdell , along with partner William Welling , the former president of Marshall Industries , an electronics distribution company , and a prominent technology analyst in his own right , has been putting the finishing touches on a new investment company in technology - Venture Growth Associates . Based in San Francisco , VGA has raised slightly over $25 million from foundations , endowments and several top executives in the technology field.Plans call for initial investments to start next month - hopefully with $40 million in the till . Investments will be made both in private companies and firms in the early publicly- owned stages . As Berdell explains it , over the past five years venture capitalists haveput up more than $6 billion in starting more than 3000 technology companies . The most successful of these will require some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VGA will try to invest in the top 1 percent when they normally experience their highest rate of revenues growth - the last three years they ' re private and the first two years they ' re public . The whole thrust here , Berdell tells me , is to invest in companies that have the potential to grow more than 50 percent a year in revenues during the next five years . Estimating that venture capitalists alone will ante up close to $7 billion for new technology ventures during the next three years , Berdell contends that " the technology explosion in this stage of the economic cycle is just beginning . " Here ' s what he regards as the six fastest growing technology areas : - Robotics and computer-aided engineering . - Applications software ( the capability of making a computer easier to use ) . - Telecommunications equipment . - Disk memory storage ( the bulk storage of data for computers ) . - Gate arrays ( a complex electronic system on one semi-conductor chip ) . - CMOS ( complementary metal oxide silicon ) - basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portable and battery-operated electronic products ( like portable computers ) . Berdell mentioned five stocks he favors in these fields : MonolithicMemories , Silicon General , Silicon Systems , Wyle Laboratories and Standard Microsystems .
