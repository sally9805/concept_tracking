As representatives of Iran and Iraq sat at the ends of a horseshoe-shaped table at the United Nations Security Council last week , they looked almost like schoolboys about to be disciplined . They stared straight ahead as Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar announced that after eight years of war and a million or more casualties , Iran and Iraq had agreed to end all hostilities on Aug. 20 . The two sides , he added , would begin peace talks in Geneva five days later . <P> Although the session lasted only 15 minutes , it underscored the new power and respect that the U.N . has recently won as a peacekeeper . But even as the U.N . was helping to halt conflicts in trouble spots from Afghanistan to southern Africa , a dispute with the U.S. over $467 million in back dues and $70 million in peacekeeping assessments threatened the success of those efforts . Said Perez de Cuellar of plans to send 350 troops to observe the Iran-Iraq cease-fire : " I simply do n't have the money to pay for it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary-General warned , the U.N . will have to cut back operations sharply when it runs out of cash reserves in November . <P> The dispute placed Washington in the awkward and embarrassing position of appearing to want peace while being unwilling to support it . Normally outspoken U.N . critics such as Claiborne Pell , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , denounced the U.S. as a " deadbeat . " <P> But not even the U.N . ' s most loyal advocates give it sole credit for the recent outbreak of peace in many parts of the world . Perez de Cuellar cited improved ties between the U.S. and the Soviet Union for creating a " much more propitious atmosphere for dialogue and understanding . " At the same time , Iran 's battlefield losses in its war with Iraq drove Tehran to accept a one- year-old U.N . resolution for halting the conflict . In southern Africa , U.S. diplomacy led to a cease-fire in Angola that utilized a ten-year-old U.N . resolution to help achieve peace . <P> Relations between Washington and the U.N . soured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ league with the Soviet bloc , seemed bent on transforming the General Assembly into a forum for attacking the U.S. and other industrial nations . One low point came in 1975 when a U.N . resolution equated Zionism with racism . Angered by a decade of such hectoring , Congress voted in 1985 to withhold a portion of its annual dues until the U.N . reformed its budget and gave large countries greater control of its spending . <P> The Reagan Administration argues that the U.S. still pays far more to support the U.N . than it receives credit for . Richard Williamson , Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations , says the U.S. contributes $1.8 billion a year to all U.N . and U.N.-affiliated operations , including dues and voluntary contributions . Even when assistance to regional development banks is excluded , Williamson says , the U.S. pays more than $900 million a year , and " that contribution dwarfs anybody else 's . " U.S. officials are particularly angered by criticism of the U.S. at a time when Moscow remains some $250 million in arrears for special peacekeeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by paying their dues for this year .
