He is 64 years old and the leader of all he surveys , yet for a moment last week George Bush looked like a schoolboy called before the principal to discuss his report card . Perched nervously on a beige sofa in Ronald Reagan 's Los Angeles office , Bush held the tip of his tongue between his lips , smiling thinly as the old President blandly pronounced that the new President is " doing just fine . " <P> Bush looked decidedly relieved when Reagan brushed aside reporters ' questions about the dilution of Reagan policies on Star Wars and military aid to the Nicaraguan contras . " Well , " Reagan said cautiously , " having had for eight years some of the same problems he 's facing now , I 'm not going to comment on that . " <P> Reagan 's praise was faint , and the body language between the two men , as ever , betrayed discomfort . Nevertheless , Bush 's advisers felt he had accomplished a major purpose of his visit : to shore up his crucial and complex relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's loyalists on the Republican right . As Bush jetted last week from Chicago to San Jose to Miami , pointing with pride to the accomplishments of his first 100 days , he and his aides stressed their " continuity " with Reagan and felt obliged to deny the obvious : embedded in their accomplishments are subtle but distinct breaks with Reagan and the right . Among them : <P> Star Wars . Bush and several of his top advisers view with skepticism Reagan 's expensive vision of a high-tech shield from enemy missiles . The 1990 budget agreement cuts funding for the program to $4.6 billion from Reagan 's proposed $5.9 billion . <P> Contras . Reagan hailed the rebels fighting Nicaragua 's Marxist government as " the moral equivalent of our Founding Fathers " and sent them overt and covert military support . Bush and Secretary of State James Baker , however , immediately abandoned the nigh hopeless goal of supplying them with more guns and bullets and , instead , struck a deal with Congress to provide continued food and housing assistance , pending elections promised by Nicaragua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summit in 1986 , Reagan stunned many of his advisers and allies by embracing the elimination of all nuclear weapons , a move that would expose Western Europe to the Warsaw Pact 's overwhelming numerical superiority in troops and tanks . Bush has expressed far less enthusiasm for nuclear-weapons reductions and has suggested they may have to be conditioned on cuts in Soviet conventional forces . <P> The Budget . Reagan relished sending Congress what one senior aide called " a go-to-hell budget " laden with domestic-spending cuts patently unacceptable to the Democrats . Bush declared at his Inauguration , " The American people did n't send us here to bicker . " He drew up a less contentious proposal and , by managing to persuade congressional leaders to accept his overly optimistic economic assumptions , struck a deal by mid-April . <P> The Environment . Reagan , who was famous for asserting that trees cause pollution , cut back on environmental protection . After declaring in his campaign , " I am an environmentalist , " Bush has appointed a respected conservationist to head the EPA ; called for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised action on a clean- air package and restrictions on acid rain ; and proposed adding a mile per gallon to federal mileage standards for motor vehicles .
