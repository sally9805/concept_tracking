CBS premieres four new series tomorrow night : // Stir Crazy ( 8-9 p. m. ) is inspired by the 1980 movie of the same name . . . but this time without Richard Pryor . However , it does surprisingly well with a very funny man named Larry Riley and his sidekick Joseph Guzaldo . They are jailed for 132 years for a crime they did not commit and , of course , escape in order to clear themselves - and maybe have some fun . The film is full of irreverent and outrageous humor . One funny sequence involves the tough police captain ( played by Polly Holliday ) who tries to convince them how tough she is by insisting she hates Disneyland and Mary Lou Retton. // The show is full of car chases and scary escapes and all the action-film standbyes , but done tongue-in-cheek . ' ' Stir Crazy ' ' is mad , mad fun and deserves a place on the schedule . However , it could run into trouble since it is up against ' ' Highway to Heaven ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it in high places. // // Charlie &; Company ( 9-9 : 30 p. m. ) is , pure and simple , a ' ' Cosby Show ' ' ripoff . It stars Flip Wilson and Gladys Knight as a black Yuppie couple coping with two teen-agers and one younger son . The pilot I viewed has now been switched to a later date , but the series , I am told , is not being changed much . Typical comment by Dad , played ( would you believe in character ) by a subdued Flip Wilson : ' ' Twenty years ago , when I decided to have a family , I knew all the answers . But now all the questions have changed . ' ' It ' s just ' ' The Huxtables Move to Chicago. ' ' // George Burns Comedy Week ( 9 : 30-10 p. m. ) features Mr. B. fore and aft , introducing an original comedy each week . Premiere episode is a vaguely uncomfortable farce about a beautiful escapee from an asylum who has constantly changing delusions about who she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in . It borders on being funny - and tasteless - but just manages to avoid both . Leads in the first segment are played by Catherine O ' Hara and Tim Matheson . We ' ve had anthology drama before , and this season we will have anthology science fiction ( ' ' Amazing Stories ' ' ) as well as anthology mystery ( ' ' Hitchcock ' ' ) , so why not anthology comedy ? This show is a good reason why not. // The Equalizer ( 10-11 p. m . ) . This may be the season for mature actors and actresses . Here comes another mature lead : Edward Woodward as a former secret agent who decides his work is too violent and gives it up to spend more time with his son . Soon he decides to be a private investigator in order to satisfy his urge to balance the scales of justice . In the premiere episode , shot in New York City , there are three intertwined stories , a la ' ' Hill Street , ' ' but too few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show . ' ' Equalizer ' ' is too complex and not quite fast-moving enough . And our hero makes too free use of weapons and lawbreaking himself . The show is being redesigned to look more like ' ' Miami Vice , ' ' I hear . But what show isn ' t planning that ? // If all that isn ' t enough , at the same time ABC and PBS are turning over their prime time to specials. // ABC ' s monumental 45/85 , a study of America since World War II , is anchored by Peter Jennings and Ted Koppel . It features all four living US Presidents , as well as just about everybody in the world involved in American foreign policy . The discussion will focus , according to executive producer Av Westin , on America ' s future , the future of world relations , and the Gorbachev summit among other things. // One of the most unusual aspects of the program is the use of witnesses - ranging from Life magazine photographer Alfred Eisenstadt to businessman Freddie Laker , from former Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Libyan leader Muammar al-Qaddafi to former UN Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick. // Westin explains : ' ' The witnesses were in the rooms when history was being made . . . . Our witnesses were also given the opportunity to tell us about other options on the table at the time of the decisionmaking , as well as the mistakes that were made then , too. ' ' // Each segment of ' ' 45/85 ' ' begins with a time frame which is literally a three-dimensional construction in which objects from that particular time period are placed . The program itself is an example of a kind of instant historymaking . It places itself in the 45/85 time frame in such a unique way that all future retrospective news documentaries may look upon this one as the groundbreaker. // PBS devotes the entire prime-time evening to The Abortion Battle , a selection of programming which reflects both pro-choice and pro-life viewpoints . Included will be the controversial ' ' The Silent Scream , ' ' which depicts an abortion through the use of ultrasound visualization , as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' narrated by Ed Asner and Tammy Grimes. // KQED/San Francisco , the producing station for ' ' The Abortion Battle ' ' regards the program as the first in a potential series of Theme Nights on controversial issues . According to executive producer Beverly Ornstein , ' ' This format is a cost-effective way to respond to our mandate to program boldly and explore extreme points of view while fulfilling our responsibilities as journalists to be balanced and fair . We think that this kind of format can have a great deal of impact , and we hope that ' ' The Abortion Battle ' ' will pave the way for more Theme Nights on other controversial subjects. ' ' // Of course , that will depend upon public reaction to this first Theme Night , and on local PBS station reaction . Many stations are either refusing to run the program at all or holding back until they can see the response in other areas , so better check your local listings if you plan to watch . No doubt about it , ' ' The Abortion Battle ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objectionable in part . But almost all points of view are accommodated , and there are enough warnings on air of delicate material that those who wish to avoid the topic completely may do so. // Theme Nights may prove to be a landmark in programming which may one day make the Fairness Doctrine obsolete in public service broadcasting. // // // //
