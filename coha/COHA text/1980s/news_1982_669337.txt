I try to remember how it was in Romania , and my memories hurt . It is only human to forget the cold winter when the summer comes , to stop wondering about darkness when you finally come to light . And I pray that I do not forget the sadness I left behind , and that I keep the committment I made to myself , that is , to share my experiences and tell people to appreciate what most of them don ' t even realize they have because it seems so natural : FREEDOM. // For years I believed that in America there could be a superficial , consumer society with no depth . I was convinced that we behind the Iron Curtain had a more complex life , and because we lacked so many things , we appreciated better the little we had . But there came a day when I questioned the truth of my convictions , and I had to admit that there was no time left for creativity and thinking between listening to hypocritical speeches , attending meaningless party meetings and standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty food stores smelling of rats while official posters announced a general rat killing campaign . I remember the frustration of going into book shops to find only mountains of President Ceausescu ' s writings in deluxe editions , and more and more his wife ' s - Academician , Doctor , Engineer , the number one lady , the woman scientist , mother and wife of a ' ' hero , ' ' symbol of what officially we all must aspire to become , symbol of all we can never become. // Ceausescu ' s works , purchased in hundreds of copies , by all public institutions , his and her portraits in every office , in every shop window , everywhere , like a haunting . One day , in the shabby kitchen of a garbage woman , I saw Ceausescu ' s portrait , and I could not stop asking ' ' Why ? Do you like him ? Has he been good to you ? ' ' Thoughtfully , she looked at me and said : ' ' I found this while looking for food for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' She paused , then added : ' ' It never hurts to have his portrait around , who knows who comes here . . . and it is better . . . just more safe. ' ' // My friend did not know to read or write , but she certainly had that unique instinct of preservation which exists in children and animals ; most of us don ' t have it , as we become older and wiser , as we learn , as we know more , and our mind decides that it is better not to exist than to exist in shame. // I decided to go away before I reached the age when nothing is any longer of any importance. // It is still fresh in my memory , a nightmare I used to have in Romania : I dreamed that my whole existence is a path starting from nothingness , that I was looking upon my own life from its upper end , aware that the next step could be the last one .

And I have learned to give thanks in everything , good and bad , for now I know that ' ' all things work together for good for them that love God.

I wish people would not lose their position if they dare speak the truth , or if their daughters chose to leave Romania . I wish Romania would give recognition to its intellectual values before it is too late ! // I walk down the bright , lively streets of Philadelphia , mingle with the happy crowds . I look at the colorful Christmas decorations everywhere and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried civilians who hunt for food , while young militia men keep an eye on the population . . . just to make sure everything is under control . . . why take any risks ? // I go shopping in Philadelphia and I am haunted by memories which don ' t even ask for permission , they just invade . . . the frustration of not finding something meaningful for those we love , and a Christmas Eve without a Christmas tree , and how could I ever forget the parents standing in endless lines , hopeful that they might be able to buy their children the most desired fruit in Romania : bananas. // Why can ' t I take my mind off Christmas 1980 ? After days of searching in Bucharest I ended up buying a plain Russian watch , the type which will function under any circumstances , even when the owner wishes it to stop , so that he can buy another one - I often wonder what happened to that watch ? Does it still show the right time , or has it been long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my love , the trust and the beauty of Christmas ! // Christmas , 1981 - I was invited to the most wonderful Christmas party I ever attended where kindness and thoughtfulness make me feel at home thousands of miles away from my homeland . My dear friends , the Van Alens. . . it was how I imagined grand families : children , parents and grandparents , together , to be joyful and to be thankful for the good things they share . Why did I feel like Alice in Wonderland ? I wished I could seize the magic of Christmas , and lock it in a glass box so that I can look at it any time I wish , afraid that it might vanish once I allow it to be free. // I would look at it just from time to time , just when I need to remind myself that life is good , and people are kind to each other and happy ; that traditions and family ties are preserved in today ' s world where so many have lost faith in the meaning of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , friendship with lies , and people are more and more afraid of each other. // Christmas , 1981 - Refugees coming from Romania bring news that the toughest anti-emigration policy ever is imposed on the nation , still hundreds of people apply for visas to leave . Ceausescu imposes severe laws against food hoarding ; several people are arrested . Newspapers describe the Romanian population as being angry but reserved. // Christmas , 1981 - Romanian friends sent me Christmas cards wishing to take advantage of the most precious asset I ' ve acquired : **28;9855; MY FREEDOM . <> And I pledge to keep the promise I made to myself , and I pray that the Lord give me strength to express my feelings , and I thank Him for the most precious gift he gave me through my friends : the gift which can not be found , or bought - it can only be given : the gift of love ! // //
