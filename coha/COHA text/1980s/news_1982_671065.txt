A decade later , the relationship is faltering over the issue that was deferred for so long - the status and future of Taiwan . The Reagan Administration ' s announced plans for selling jet fighter planes and military spare parts to the Nationalist regime on Taiwan has revived Chinese resentment and threatened to unravel the ties woven so far. // The 10th anniversary of the Shanghai Communique tomorrow is being virtually ignored here . China ' s leader , Deng Xiaoping , told an American visitor , K.S. Wu , last weekend that " Sino-U . S. relations are not good " and that China could do without the United States if it had to. // // ' Relations Are Facing a Crisis ' // The sour new mood has been reflected by other officials like Deputy Foreign Minister Zhong Xidong , who told some American reporters recently that " it is no exaggeration to say that relations are facing a crisis. " // Most diplomats here believe that the Peking leadership will carry out its threat to downgrade relations with Washington if the arms sales to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the embassies here and in Washington to their former status of liaison offices. // " If the U.S. takes an unacceptable position in regard to Taiwan , they are not going to swallow it , " said an experienced non-Western diplomat . " It is a mistake to believe they will not call the American bluff. " // Yet while Chinese-American relations are fragile at the core , they look remarkably sturdy around the edges , suggesting that a real rupture could be as costly and even unpalatable for China as for the United States. // For all the Chinese dissatisfaction expressed in the last few months , Peking has shown no inclination to hit back at Washington by repairing its tattered ties with Moscow . " I don ' t think the Chinese will resort to playing the Russian card , " said an Asian diplomat. // Wang Bingnan , who heads China ' s Friendship Association With Foreign Countries , said several days ago during a trip to Pakistan that China had no plans to improve relations until Moscow gave up its " policy of hegemonism and expansionism. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from identification with the United States by cultivating its old links with other developing countries . Peking has reverted to Mao Zedong ' s theory of three worlds , the first being the " superpowers " - the United States and the Soviet Union - the second , the industrialized Western countries and Japan , and the third , the world ' s underdeveloped countries , like China , that suffered colonialist exploitation . <> <> U.S. Is Called ' Hegemonistic ' // The Chinese press again periodically depicts the United States as " hegemonistic " along with the Soviet Union . Last week , at a conference of developing countries in New Delhi , a Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister , Bu Shouz@hang , charged that hopes for global negotiations on spreading the world ' s wealth had been " shattered by the repeated obstructions on the part of the United States. " // The swing back toward the third world began well before the blow-up over the Taiwan arms issue early this year . In the view of some diplomats , it was prompted at least in part by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited the technology and capital China was hoping to get. // Peking ' s apprehensions over Soviet adventurism have caused it to line up with Washington on some major international issues , such as the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan . Yet China differs sharply with the United States over the Palestinian question in the Middle East , the presence of American troops in South Korea and sanctions against South Africa . Last month , the Chinese flatly rejected an American request to join the criticism of the military crackdown in Poland. // " I think the Chinese have remained Chinese , " said a Western diplomat . " They haven ' t changed . The circumstances in the world have changed . The Chinese don ' t look upon the United States as a model . They say they consider it decadent. " // Both Chinese and American diplomats here refuse to discuss the present difficulties over Taiwan , following the stormy visit here in January by John H. Holdridge , the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs . Mr. Holdridge had said that confidential talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms for Taiwan. // But the United States Ambassador in Peking , Arthur W. Hummel Jr. , has observed that there are strengths as well as weaknesses in the overall Chinese-American relationship. // " Ten years of U.S.-China relations , and three of full diplomatic relations , have brought very significant accomplishments on both sides as well as some problems and divergencies , " he said in a statement . " It is remarkable that several administrations on both sides have been able to find so many ways to bridge , for mutual benefits , the wide disparities in U.S. and Chinese social , political and economic systems . " <> <> More Consulates Planned // In the last decade , ties between the two countries , which were battlefield enemies in the Korean War , have matured to an extent that few anticipated when the Shanghai Communique was signed . Today , each country has a full-fledged embassy and two consulates on the other ' s soil . Last month , documents were exchanged permitting an additional three consulates each. // The United States has become China ' s third-largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flow of goods last year totaling $5. 5 billion . China has contracted to buy at least six million tons of American grain annually for four years , and last year bought over eight million tons . About 80 American companies have set up offices in Peking and the Bank of China has opened a branch in New York. // Last year , almost 16 , 000 visitors ' visas were issued to Chinese by United States consular officials here . More than 6 , 000 Chinese students are enrolled at American universities and technical schools , many with local financial aid . American teachers and students are also among the nearly 1 , 500 American citizens living and working in China , while up to 80 , 000 American tourists were estimated to have visited China last year. // Cultural exchanges have moved more slowly , in view of Peking ' s suspicion of Western values . But the Boston Symphony Orchestra and an exhibition of paintings from the Boston Museum of Fine Arts have been well received here , as was a carefully checked American film series seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most-favored-nation trading status , which the Soviet Union never received , and has raised the level of the American technology that the Chinese are allowed to import . Last summer , Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. announced that the United States was willing to sell China weapons on a case-by-case basis , an offer that the Chinese have not taken up because of the Taiwan issue. // This progress is being jeopardized by the revival of bitter differences over Taiwan , which the United States sidestepped in the Shanghai Communique with the ambiguous acknowledgment that " all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China . " <> <> Peking Claims Sovereignty // The argument entails whether Washington , in recognizing Peking as the legal Government in China , has accepted its claim to sovereignty over Taiwan . Since formal ties were established three years ago , the New China News Agency charged last month , " the U.S. Government has failed to honor its commitment. " // Peking saw some of Mr. Reagan ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to Washington ' s old " two Chinas " policy , and it was not quite mollified by Secretary Haig ' s assurances last summer that things had not changed . Mr. Deng told the visiting Secretary of the Treasury , Donald T. Regan , in November that " there has to be a continuity of policy between China and the United States. " // When the Reagan Administration began raising the prospect of selling more aircraft and arms to Taiwan , the New China News Agency first called it " insulting to us beyond limit " and then complained during Mr. Holdridge ' s visit that not consulting Peking beforehand was " really going too far . ' <> <> ' Reunification , ' Not ' Liberation ' // The Peking leadership has switched from " liberation " to " reunification " in stating its policy on Taiwan and it seemed annoyed that a nine-point reunification formula announced last September , which would let the Nationalists on Taiwan retain their political and economic system and their armed forces , drew a belatedly lukewarm endorsement from Secretary Haig. // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that needs China , not the other way around . The New China News Agency asserted last August that " as a declining superpower , the U.S. is no longer capable of countering the Soviet Union on her own , while she still feels that the strength of her joint allies is insufficient. " // " This compels the U.S.A. to rely on China ' s strength for support and to develop a ' strategic relationship ' with China , " the press agency said . <> <> Western Technology Needed // Some diplomats here note , however , that Mr. Deng ' s domestic policy of improving living standards relies partly upon technological and capital infusions from the West . They doubt that Mr. Deng could impose more belt-tightening on top of the existing economic retrenchment that Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang has said would last through 1985. // China increased its exports to the United States last year by nearly 80 percent , to $1. 9 billion . Moreover , China needs American technology , whether in computers or in new oil extraction equipment , to carry out its modernization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bid on China ' s potential offshore oilfields are American. // Despite the strains , Foreign Minister Huang Hua declared last week that with the establishment of diplomatic ties , Chinese-American friendship was " growing steadily . " He said that " sometimes relations between the states may be overcast and the road ahead may be rugged , but the friendship between the peoples is everlasting. " //
