The image was so faint that scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , checked to make sure it was not the result of a blemish on the camera lens or static distorting the telemetry . But it was real , a tiny circle that represented a previously undiscovered moon only 35 miles in diameter , orbiting 37,500 miles above the murky atmosphere of the planet Uranus . <P> The photograph , transmitted across 1.8 billion miles of emptiness , was taken by the indefatigable traveler Voyager 2 as it approached its Jan. 24 rendezvous with the solar system 's seventh planet . On that day , the spacecraft will swoop to within 50,000 miles of Uranus , which last week still looked to Voyager 's cameras like a featureless , cloud-covered , blue-green disk . The temporary designation of the new moon , 1985 Ul , seems rather prosaic when compared with Uranus ' five other satellites : Miranda , Ariel , Umbriel , Titania and Oberon . But that should change this summer when the International Astronomical Union meets to assign permanent names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut out for it . Astronomers think Voyager may soon spot as many as 18 more Uranian moons .
