They ' re in abortion clinic waiting rooms everywhere . They leaf through old magazines , never reading the words . Some simply gaze at the floor and tap their feet . Rarely do they look at one another . Rarely do they talk to one another . It ' s tough going in a waiting room for men involved in an abortion . Now , a growing number of researchers and counselors are recognizing that abortion poses far greater problems for men than just a tough wait . According to these professionals , men can be the silent victims of abortion . Some suffer repressed guilt , hostility , anger , frustration and conflict . And many have no one with whom to share those feelings.Because men are unable to bear children and are legally powerless to stop the termination of a pregnancy , many are left with feelings of powerlessness and confusion . " If he ' s somewhat concerned , he still has a feeling of helplessness , even if a couple made the decision together , " said Roberta A. Barrasso , director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1031 Beacon st . A four-year study released in late 1980 by Dr. Arthur B. Shostak , professor of sociology at Drexel University in Philadelphia , has shown that some men are troubled for as long as a year after being involved with an abortion . This study of 100 males , aged 17 to 34 , also included Shostak ' s own " remorseful involvement in the medical termination of an unwanted pregnancy . " Of these 100 males - predominately white students between 20-24 - only 10 frequently accompanied their partners to the counseling sessions ; 37 went once or twice , and the rest received no counseling at all . According to Shostak , 40 of the men talked only to their partners about the issue . Shostak estimates that there are nearly one million men involved with abortion each year , and he concedes that his sample is too small to be representative of all that group . But he notes that clinic personnel have told him that the characteristics of his sample group are fairly typical . Moreover , six years of on-going research has convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility and sharing in the abortion experience . He wants to call that concept " cobortion . " Sal ( not his real name ) was involved in an abortion last fall , ands talked about the mental torment he and his partner went through . " It was tough . It really was . I was just miserable the whole time , " he said . Sal , who is a Boston-area student , is 18 and his friend is 20 . Although the couple agreed that an abortion was necessary , the process turned out to be more of an ordeal than he thought . " It ' s easy to talk about how you ' re gon na have an abortion , " said Sal , who accompanied his partner through the procedure . " But you watch the actual event and . . . when it ' s right there happening , you sort of lose touch with your logic . It was terrible . That was the worst 10 minutes of my life . " She was scared out of her mind . Just seeing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was responsible for it , threw me . Right after , I went to the waiting room and broke down . I had seen her go through this and felt responsible in a way . " he said . Sal told only a close friend about the abortion . " Even that I don ' t think was the right thing to do , " he said . " But I just had to talk to someone . " He added that the experience brought him and his girlfriend closer , something that happened to more than a third of the couples in Dr. Shostak ' s study . However , nearly half the men in the study revealed that the abortion experience weakened or destroyed their relationships . Sal ' s advice to couples who never have experienced an abortion is " to think things ( a sexual relationship and birth control ) out ahead of time . " That is something more people , including most men , have to do , according to professionals in the abortion field . " Men , in most instances , don ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Blanche R. Lansky , coordinator of community relations at Pre-Term . There were 44,044 abortions in Massachusetts in 1979 , the latest available data compiled by the Registry of Vital Statistics . Most abortions were performed on women between 20 and 24 . ( In the same year , there were 72,295 births . ) Nationwide , there were more than 1.2 million abortions , and approximately one third of that number were performed on women 20 to 24 , according to Dr. David A. Grimes , of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta . " A lot of guys can ' t withstand the crisis , " said Martin I. Cohn , public information director at the New England Women ' s Service . " Especially if they have certain feelings about abortion . " Recently , at one Boston-area abortion clinic , the police had to eject a distraught man who had tried to stop his girlfriend from getting an abortion . " I ' ve seen men cry during the abortion procedure , " Barrasso said . " I ' ve seen men upset because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actualprocedure . " Other counselors describe situations in which men have difficulty grappling with abortion , whether they feel the abortion is necessary or not . " Some are totally involved and committed . They take the abortion decision very seriously , " said Mag Miller , a counselor at Pre-Term in Boston , the largest abortion clinic in the state . " On the other hand , some seem to come in here under pressure and don ' t want to take any responsiblity . " If we have a woman who is sure that is what she wants , and the man doesn ' t have control , it ' s a tough spot for him to be in , " she added . Even when both parties agree to an abortion , many men have to deal with another issue because they feel responsible for the health of their partner . Cohn added that most colleges have health services for women to advise them on the various methods of birth control and abortion , but offer few services for men . " The health services are geared toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy go ? Same with the abortion experience . Where does he go ? What organization is there ? There is none . "
