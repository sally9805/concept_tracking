Using somber and forceful tones , the Presidential commission issued a highly detailed report of more than 300 pages that was sharply critical of a President who has dominated the political life of the country for six years , gliding gracefully across the national stage with an optimistic smile. // Former Senator John G. Tower , a Republican who is head of the commission , said at a news conference that " the President clearly didn ' t understand the nature of this operation , who was involved and what was happening . " <> <> Harsh on President ' s Aides // The report was particularly harsh on the President ' s aides , and it could accelerate a major overhaul in the White House staff that has seemed imminent for weeks. // In unusually blunt language , the board placed direct blame on Donald T. Regan , the White House chief of staff , and other advisers for giving the President poor advice and neglecting to grasp " the serious legal and political risks " of the arms deal and the subsequent diversion of profits to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board issued its report at a critical moment in the Reagan Presidency , and it provided a vivid climax to an unfolding drama that has dominated the capital for three months . How the President responds to the report in a speech tentatively scheduled for next week could determine whether he remains an active and effective leader during his final two years in office . <> <> High Reputation of Panel // The report represents an unusual exercise in government : a President coming under fire from a panel that he himself appointed and that is headed by a senior member of his own party. // But the high reputation of the panel , which included Edmund S. Muskie , a former Senator and Secretary of State , and Brent Scowcroft , a former general and national security adviser , only lent added weight to their criticisms , and increased pressure on the President to respond effectively. // Many of Mr. Reagan ' s closest advisers are hoping that the severity of the Tower report will jar him into condemning the operation more strenuously than he has , and into accepting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice today when he said at the news conference : " I think that the President must respond with great candor . I think that there is a great deal that he will learn from reading our report that has not been brought to his attention by his subordinates. " // " Yes , the President made mistakes , " Mr. Tower said . " I think that ' s very plain English . The President did make mistakes . A lot of his subordinates made mistakes. " // Mr. Reagan appeared grim today as he delivered a brief public statement just before the Tower board ' s news conference . He seemed to stumble verbally several times as he said , " I pledge to the American people today that I will do whatever is necessary to enact the proper reforms and to meet the challenges ahead. " // The President said he would " read and digest " the report over the weekend and " think carefully about its findings. " // The report draws a picture of a rogue force in the White House National Security Council , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pursuing a private foreign policy that directly contradicted publicly stated aims of the Administration. // The report listed these conclusions : // * While Mr. Reagan insists that he can not remember when he approved the first Iran arms shipment , he probably did give his assent before the shipment took place in August 1985. // * Some Presidential aides deliberately tried to conceal important information about the Iran deal and to minimize Mr. Reagan ' s role . The President was not part of the effort , the report said , and " did not intend to mislead the American public , " but it suggests that he was not totally candid at all times. // * The question of whether laws were violated remains " very murky , " in General Scowcroft ' s words , but the report concludes that the President ' s aides willfully ignored legal restraints and might well have breached several statutes. // * The National Security Council repeatedly failed to follow its own procedures for reviewing operations . " The result , " the report says , " was an unprofessional and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite repeated protestations by the President that he had not intended to trade arms for hostages , the whole Iran operation quickly became a series of frustrating and futile deals . " This sad history , " the report says , " is powerful evidence of why the United States should never become involved in arms transfers. " // * The profits from the arms deal could not be traced , and the commission found considerable evidence but no hard proof that funds were diverted to the contras . Nor was any evidence found that Mr. Reagan knew about any diversion of profits . The report includes embarrassing new revelations , showing that Administration officials were more deeply involved in raising private funds for the contras than previously suspected. // * The United States was receiving intelligence information about Iranian plans for anti-American terrorist operations as the President ' s aides were concluding the arms deal with other Iranian factions . Assigned to Examine N.S.C. The Tower commission , formally known as the President ' s Special Review Board , was originally assigned to study the operation of the National Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advises the President on foreign policy and security issues . Some of the panel ' s harshest words are aimed at the council for taking direct control of the Iran deal , bypassing the Central Intelligence Agency , the State Department and the Pentagon . The panel concluded that Vice Adm . John M. Poindexter , the national security adviser during most of 1986 , and his aide , Lieut . Col. Oliver L. North , " functioned largely outside the orbit of the U.S. Government " and traditional policy-making procedures . " Their activities were not subject to critical reviews of any kind , " the report added ( in Part IV , the section titled " What Was Wrong " ) . // In a section on recommendations , the panel suggested that as a " general matter , " the N.S.C. council and its staff " should not engage in the implementation of policy or the conduct of operations . " It opposed legislation that would totally ban such operations. // The board also opposed suggestions , made occasionally in Congress , that the appointment of the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff aide , the security adviser " should continue to serve only one master , " and that master is the President , not Congress ( in Part V , the section titled " Recommendations " ) . // In analyzing how the Iran operation turned sour , the Tower panel stressed that the Administration seemed " over-obsessed with secrecy , " as Mr. Muskie put it at the press briefing . " Every time that you are over-concerned with secrecy , you tend to abandon process , " he said. // The report describes Mr. Reagan ' s " intense compassion " for the American hostages held in Lebanon by allies of the Iranian authorities . This feeling was conveyed to his aides and helped generate the extraordinary pressure and tenacity behind the Iran deal. // But this emotional response of the President , the board said , led to a policy that contradicted the Administration ' s declared refusal to deal with terrorists and finally proved to be counter-productive. // " The United States never should have been a party to the arms transfer , " the report concluded. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell arms to Iran , in creating incentives for future hostage-taking , in threatening the balance of power in the Iran-Iraq war , in increasing America ' s image in the Arab world as a " creature of Israel " and in raising questions about the truth of Administration statements to its allies. // The report said Mr. Reagan ' s management style generally leaves operational details to others . But at such a critical and risky moment , the report added , the President should have been more diligent in forcing reviews of the policy and insisting upon accountability among subordinates. // " He must insist on accountability , " the report said , " for it is the President who must take responsibility for the N.S.C. system and deal with the consequences. " // The report said that Mr. Regan , who has been under intense pressure to resign , " as much as anyone , should have insisted that an orderly process be observed . " It also blamed the chief of staff for " the chaos that descended upon the White House " when the operation became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William J. Casey , then Director of Central Intelligence , who learned about the Iran arms dealings about a month before they became public . Mr. Casey did not move promptly to tell the President , the report said , " yet his responsibility to do so was clear. " // Admiral Poindexter , who resigned his post after the affair became public , was faulted for not trying to halt the diversion of profits to the contras and for failing to understand the seriousness of that development. // Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger opposed the arms deal , the report said . But instead of pressing their objections , they " simply distanced themselves from the program. " // " They were not energetic in attempting to protect the President from the consequences of his personal commitment to freeing the hostages , " the report said. // The report adds that some aides tried energetically to conceal the facts from the public . The board quotes an interview with Robert C. McFarlane , the former national security adviser , who said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the affair that tried to " gild the President ' s motives " and to leave ambiguous his role. // Mr. McFarlane said the account he helped draft was " misleading , at least , and wrong , at worst. " // He has insisted repeatedly that the President gave his approval to the first arms shipment before the weapons were shipped at the end of August 1985 . Mr. Regan , the chief of staff , has been equally adamant in saying the President endorsed the shipment only after it was made. // The report sides with Mr. McFarlane , saying the President " most likely " gave prior approval to the first Israeli shipment of arms to Iran . While it says that this point can not be proved conclusively , it states , " Even if Mr. McFarlane did not have the President ' s explicit private approval , he clearly had his full support. " // The President has given three different accounts of the matter . On Jan. 16 , he said his approval had come before the shipment of arms . On Feb. 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said he could not recall authorizing the shipment. // Finally , in a letter to the board on Feb. 20 , Mr. Reagan wrote : " I have no personal notes or records to help my recollection on this matter . The only honest answer is to state that try as I might , I can not recall anything whatsoever about whether I approved an Israeli sale in advance or whehter I approved replenishment of Israeli stocks around August of 1985 . My answer therefore and the simple truth is , I don ' t remember - period. " //
