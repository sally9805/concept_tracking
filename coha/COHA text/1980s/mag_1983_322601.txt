A powerful new machine accelerates U.S. high-energy physics <P> As they watched a green line edge across a video screen , the excitement mounted . " It 's going ! " exclaimed one of the exultant scientists . " Keep going ! Keep going ! " shouted another . The control room soon erupted into a chorus of unrestrained cheers . Bottles of champagne were broken out , and toasts resounded . <P> That tumultuous scene last week , reminiscent of a locker-room victory celebration , marked a more esoteric kind of triumph . When the green line made its telltale movement at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory , the sprawling high-energy physics research center outside Chicago , it signified a major scientific achievement . At that instant , Fermilab 's newly rebuilt accelerator ( physicists prefer that term to atom smasher ) climbed to 512 billion electron volts ( GeV ) , * the highest energy level ever reached by the powerful machines used by physicists to study the fundamental secrets of matter . <P> The record , to be sure , was only a minor increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years after its completion , the accelerator hit 500 GeV and has been operating close to that level ever since . But the jubilant scientists nonetheless had reason to celebrate . The test meant that years of work had finally paid off and that the $130 million set aside to make the machine the most complex accelerator ever built had really been well spent . In the months ahead , it will gradually be boosted to 800 GeV and perhaps by next year to a trillion electron volts ( TeV ) . At full operating power , the device will not only live up to its name , Tevatron ( from the Greek teras , or monster , a scientific symbol for a trillion ) , but will also put the U.S. back in the forefront of high-energy physics . Says Fermilab Director Leon Lederman : " The Tevatron is a leapfrog . If we had n't done it , our program would have been seriously compromised . " <P> The ancient Greeks needed only their powerful intellects and imaginations to postulate atoms as the basic building blocks of matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated machines like Fermilab 's Tevatron . By pummeling the nucleus , the atom 's central mass , with protons or other subatomic particles , physicists can literally tear apart the fabric of matter , somewhat like peeling layers from an onion . Every peel , however , requires increasingly powerful and costlier machines . As Stanford Physicist Wolfgang Panofsky notes , " The smaller the objects , the bigger the microscope we must use to see them . " <P> The findings at the other end of those searching instruments have excited the entire scientific world . In the past four years , Fermilab 's major overseas rivals , notably CERN ( the European Organization for Nuclear Research ) , located outside Geneva , have discovered a group of new particles that helps confirm what physicists call the standard model . This divides matter into two basic types of particles : quarks , which are the building blocks of protons , neutrons and other " heavy " components of the atomic nucleus ; and leptons , exemplified by " light " particles like the electron .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
