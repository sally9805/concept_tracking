Blue Chip IBM <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> IBM is American to its core , which is what helps make it so profitable and , possibly , unique July 11 . When I attend company conferences , I feel as if I am in a meeting of the United Nations . I sit among Japanese , blacks , Chinese , Indians , Arabs , Hispanics and women . In confronting its competition , the company is fiercely tough and at the same time ethical . <P> <P> Barry Polisuk San Jose , Calif . <P> <P> IBM , the great sales colossus , is also great to sell to . We are a company that has provided IBM with services for ten years and have found it to be a model customer . It is fair , pays on time and cooperates completely when problems arise . Unlike many other large corporations , which have double standards for buying and selling , IBM practices what it preaches . <P> <P> Robert M.

The Carter-Reagan debate did not determine who won or lost the presidency . The Democrat ; are looking for something to damage Reagan 's image and hurt his chances for reelection . <P> <P> Mark E. Mitchell Doraville , Ga . <P> <P> It does not matter whether President <P> Reagan had knowledge of what was going <P> on at the time of the debate . He knows <P> now and should speak out clearly about <P> the morality of what was allegedly done . <P> <P> Georgia Janewicz <P> Wilmette , Ill . <P> <P> Who took Carter 's briefing book ? Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Challenging Arafat <P> The plight of the Palestinians July 11 is deplorable . But let us not forget the inflexibility shown by the P.L.O . leaders , especially Yasser Arafat . They have refused any kind of compromise and have been the rudest of guests whenever an Arab country has extended hospitality to them . They have also allied themselves with villains like Libya 's Muammar Gaddafi and Iran 's Ayatullah Khomeini . Arafat is getting what he deserves . <P> <P> Mir Fattah Rome <P> The Palestinians ' needs come last even with their friends , Syria and the Soviet Union . With Arafat , the Palestinians rank first 24 hours a day , seven days a week , 52 weeks a year . <P> <P> Pat DeLaney St. Louis <P> Sticks and Stones
