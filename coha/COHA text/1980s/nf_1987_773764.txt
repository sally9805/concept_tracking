txt // Road Haulage ? Up to 3000 undertakings will be compulsorily acquired and 50 000 undertakings will have a net placed around them with little opportunity for expansion . ? C " Licencees ? Trade and industry generally will be vocal about the restriction but will , I expect , be relieved at the reasonable character of my proposals . Wagon Owners will object to losing a facility . Local Authorities will , no doubt , dislike the compensation terms for their trading undertakings . Bus Combines and Docks will probably complain about the uncertainties involved in regional schemes in the future . Trade Unions will regard the provisions for compensation to staff as ungenerous . In spite of prospects of strong opposition from various interests , I am convinced that the present Bill does provide a sound frame-work within which the British Transport Commission , assured of the active support of the government , could provide an integrated system of public transport to the general benefit of the whole community . Some dislocation in the initial stages will be inevitable , but over a reasonable period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national organisation will be achieved . ' 40 The Bill in fact was skilfully drafted to cover numerous procedural and administrative points . It avoided any danger of the Examiner of Public Bills ruling that it was hybrid ' in character . It provided carefully for powers to disclaim agreements entered by the vested undertakings after publication of the Bill ( Clause 15 ) ; for the frustration of any attempt to pay deathbed dividends ' ( Clause 20 ) ; and , following trade union representations , for detailed regulations covering compensation to displaced staff ( Clauses 105 ? 107 ) . But it said nothing at all about the major issues of policy involved by nationalisation such as the method of securing co-ordination or road and rail services ; the future basis of charging for transport ; the basis for rationalising the nation 's port facilities ; the future organisation of road passenger services ; the principles for securing adequate new investment ; the proportion of the budget to be devoted to research ; the principles intended to govern pay and conditions of the staff . All these great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission in the vaguest possible terms ? e.g. to prepare Charges Schemes for submission to the Transport Tribunal , or regional schemes for ports and road passenger transport for submission to the Minister . In other words , the civil servants effectively // protected the Minister from challenge about the major problems of the transport industry over which he was nominally in charge . If , instead of a semi-autonomous public corporation , nationalised transport had been organised as a department akin to the Post Office , the Minister and his civil servants would not have been able to evade being involved in these major problems . Having protected the Minister in this way , the Bill provided that , in numerous aspects of its work , the Commission must nevertheless act in accordance with directions from the Minister ' , or on lines settled with the approval of the Minister ' , or must submit proposals for the Minister 's approval . In other words , the Minister was to enjoy power , especially of a negative character , over the Commission without accepting any responsibility for the outcome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wrote in his diary on 29 November 1946 , The transport nationalisation bill has been published . Of course this is the thing I would like to run as I did so much work on it in 1940 . But I am sure I shall never have any really first class job like this to do ' . 3 Consultation and Opposition It is remarkable that , in all the discussions and negotiations during 1946 and 1947 , there was little or no real consultation between the government and experts in the various branches of the transport industry . On the one hand , the transport operators were unwilling to assist in promoting what they saw as their own demise ; on the other , a government backed by a large Parliamentary majority was not inclined to compromise or review its strategy . The consequences were unfortunate , particularly as regards the railways . On 22 January 1946 , and again on 6 February , Barnes met the railway chairmen but a profitable dialogue did not follow . He offered to listen to their views on the scope of acquisition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he warned that once the Government 's proposals had been made public , he might not be in the same position ' . This warning did not have the desired effect : on the contrary , the chairmen said that they would prefer to reserve their position until the government 's plans were known . Lord Portal , chairman of the Great Western Railway , confirmed this in a letter to Barnes dated 6 February . Later on further meetings between the Minister and the chairmen took place , on 1 June and 24 September 1946 , about the compensation to railway stockholders , but this scarcely ranked as consultation , since Colonel Gore-Browne , speaking on behalf of his colleagues said that his criticism must be destructive ' . All the chairmen argued that the proposed terms were inadequate , comparing the standard revenue ' under the 1921 Railways Act , and the actual earnings in recent years , with the income from the proposed compensation stocks . They had already a sense of grievance in that , under the second Railway Control Agreement the fixed payment to the stockholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue in 1941 , less than 42 per cent in 1942 , no more than 41 per cent in 1943 , and 48 per cent in 1944 . ' The nationalisation terms would reduce the shareholders ' income still further ( as the Chancellor of the Exchequer , Hugh Dalton , had already observed , with pleasure ) . These arguments failed to persuade the Minister , still less the Treasury , to amend the terms . However , on 16 January 1947 Barnes 22 // wrote to Gore-Browne at the Railway Companies Association suggesting that railway officers should discuss with Ministry officials some matters of detail . Gore-Browne asked for a list of the specific points arising ; this was furnished by Barnes on 3 February but turned out to contain nothing of real significance ? through rates for export traffic , inclusion of minor railways in the list of those to be acquired , transfer of existing legal powers of the railway companies , and other subsidiary questions . Lord Portal replied on 11 February agreeing that such discussions should take place , provided the chairmen were sent copies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings with Hurcomb on these minor issues and a Committee of Assistants to General Managers ' was set up to consider the future of the Railway Clearing House after nationalisation . That was all . Contacts with the road haulage industry were even less fruitful . On 6 November 1945 the Minister met the chairman and some members of the Road Haulage Association , initially to discuss the continuance of the wartime Road Haulage Organisation , which the Association urged should have been wound up as soon as the war ended . The RHA were told that the government expected to be in a position to make a statement very shortly upon the future of inland transport as a whole ' . Barnes was asked whether any useful purpose would be served by the Association putting forward alternative plans for coordination without nationalisation ' but replied that he could not commit himself beyond saying that he was always prepared to look at constructive plans ... He could not however encourage the Association to hope that such plans would be accepted as a substitute for nationalisation ... He hoped that the Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . within the limits of the Cabinet 's decision . ' At the next meeting , on 26 November 1945 , the RHA 's chairman reaffirmed the Association 's wholehearted opposition to nationalisation and could not offer any collaboration at this stage . Barnes replied that answers to various specific queries raised by the RHA could only be given if the Association decided to collaborate and set up the necessary consultative machinery . This was not forthcoming ; in fact the then Secretary of the Road Haulage Association has since written : Inredible as it may seem , we had absolutely no contact with the Minister , Ministry or Labour MPs during the drafting of the Transport Bill . There were occasional leaks , mainly through the indiscretions of Licensing Authorities , but none were reliable and until the Bill was published in late 1946 none of us in the industry knew // anything about it . Hurcomb was rather remote in those days and although I must have seen Birtchnell on other matters ( e.g. the abolition of the 20 mph speed limit ) we never had a single exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember my asking him how efficiency was to be secured in a monopoly and his answer was that the establishment of an effective claims department would be a complete answer ! I think the failure to consult was almost entirely due to the attitude of the Road Haulage Association . I urged upon them a policy of collaboration at Ministry level without prejudice to opposition at political level . But they would have none of this ? the very word " collaboration " invoked shades of Vichy ! ' Opposition to the Bill brought the railways and the Road Haulage Association together in a strong publicity campaign . The keynote of their argument was that they had already reached voluntary agreements on post-war co-ordination and that these removed the main reason for nationalisation . These two strange bedfellows now collaborated in an open letter ' to the Minister of Transport entitled The Challenge of Tomorrow 's Transport . It pleaded that statutory controls were already effective to protect the public interest , and that voluntary co-operation was better than integration ' under any National Transport Authority or similar body . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richmond Temple , who had successfully operated on its behalf during the pre-war Square Deal ' campaign . Leaflets and publicity material proliferated , though without any perceptible effect on either ministers or civil servants . Inside the railways , the London Midland and Scottish was perhaps the most active in its propaganda . The Great Western ( conservative with both a large C ' and a small c ' ) seemed incredulous that so heinous an event as nationalisation could really be intended . After all , in 1923 the original creation of Brunel and Gooch had escaped grouping at the eleventh hour , whilst all the other companies had been forced to lose their identity ! Barnes complained that stationmasters were being asked to campaign against nationalisation and that railway outgoing correspondence was being franked with anti-nationalisation slogans ; this came after he had received two protests from the Railway Clerks Association dated 24 January and 12 February 1947 . His letter produced a promise to cease the franking of correspondence , but an assertion that stationmasters were entitled to express their personal opinions on political issues . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London Passenger Transport Board . Lord Ashfield , its Chairman seems to have regarded London Transport as his personal fief , to give away if he thought fit . On 20 June 1946 , without previously calling the Board together , he had met Barnes and told him that he felt that the LPTB should be included in the new British Transport Commission ; he had already , on 15 May , told Hurcomb of his conclusion . ' The members of the Board seem to have been entirely silent , even passive in their attitude to the prospect of nationalisation , though on 3 October 1946 their Chief Legal Adviser placed a paper for information ' before them summarising the provisions of the various nationalisation Acts already passed . Only after the Transport Bill had been published on 25 November 1946 was the Board called to a special meeting , on 27 November , at which in Ashfield 's absence John Cliff ' reported that earlier in the year Barnes had outlined to Ashfield the government 's intentions and had asked his views as an individual and in confidence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Minister ( on 13 August ) and that the Minister had replied on 13 September . The Board were shown the text of these letters and also the draft of a further letter from Ashfield about compensation which was not sent because on 18 November Barnes had already announced in the House of Commons the terms decided upon by the government . At the Board 's meeting on 5 December 1946 consideration was given to a memorandum by the Solicitor which described the effect that the Transport Bill would have on the LPTB . The relevant minute reads tersely Noted ' ; and at a later meeting that month , on the 19th , Ashfield explained that the LPTB stockholders were to be treated on the same basis as those of the main line railways . The Board 's minute on this reads merely the matter to be kept under review ' . Next month too , it was decided to take no action about the provisions in the Bill regarding compensation to officers and staff displaced as a result of nationalisation . ' This submissive attitude of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominance despite his age ( he was seventy-two in the autumn of 1946 ) and his technique of management , which was always to keep the Board 's minutes uninformative , and the discussions also ? all tricky things were put down for discussion without supporting papers . Ashfield would square Cliff and Latham in advance on any difficult one , and push it through ' .9 In the absence of his personal papers , Ashfield 's reasons for // recommending inclusion of the LPTB can only be a matter for conjecture . One reason may have been that he saw this as a continuation of a long process . He had , with Sir Edgar Speyer , masterminded the formation of the London traffic combine ' in 1912 ; he had , with Herbert Morrison , worked towards the creation of the LPTB in 1933 . The same process of unification and integration ' but on a larger scale , may have appealed to him . Another factor may have been the uncertain financial outlook . London Transport was certainly not earning enough to meet its revenue outgoings by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its stocks . Fares had gone up by 10 per cent and costs by 45 per cent ' .10 Not until early in 1947 were fares to be raised enough to restore the position , even temporarily . Yet another reason may have been the need for substantial bus renewals , deferred during the war years , and also for railway investment , including completion of the 1935 ? 40 new works programme , requiring access to outside financing . Quite justifiably , Ashfield may also have felt that London Transport could and should make an important contribution within the new combine ' , bringing in not merely experience of integrating ' road and rail services , but also a great deal of managerial talent , some of which could probably be exported to other parts of the undertaking . A final factor may have been ( though on this the papers yield no evidence ) assurances from Barnes and Hurcomb that he would be offered a seat on the new Commission . Quite unnecessarily , the railway unions sent a deputation to Barnes on 24 September 1946 urging the inclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an open door . " In the road passenger field outside London , the three main bus groups ? British Electric Traction Co . Ltd , Thomas Tilling Ltd , and Scottish Motor Traction Ltd ? initially expected expropriation of the bus companies , and were relieved to see the Scheme-making powers , which offered room for negotiation . The three groups had a meeting with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport on 24 April 1947 , at which they wanted to know what terms of acquisition were in mind . There was already , according to the Ministry 's note of the proceedings , some divergence of view ' between the Tilling and BET spokesmen ; Sir Frederick Heaton would not object to a specific date for the transfer of his undertaking ' but Mr J. S. Wills of BET did not favour any date of transfer being put into the Bill ' . Sir William Thomson of the SMT apparently agreed with Sir Frederick Heaton 's alternative suggestion , that terms of acquisition might be negotiated // in advance of the Bill becoming law . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the whole position open.12 This divergence of view between the Tilling and BET groups was not purely over financial matters . Sir Frederick Heaton had already publicly expressed himself in favour of nationalisation and , as he told the Tilling shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 4 February 1947 , had in 1942 circulated a paper proposing the creation of a National Transport Authority with , below it , regional boards for road passenger services . ( He did not however disclose that he was already favourably considering a voluntary sale of the Tilling bus companies to the British Transport Commission . ) Relations between the Tilling group and the BET group had become much less close since 1942 , in which year the Tilling ? BAT group , which had jointly owned a number of important bus companies , had been split up and the member companies assigned to one or other of the parent groups . And , far from sharing Heaton 's view of the inevitability of nationalisation , BET 's chairman , H. C. Drayton , 13 was to announce that BET would fight nationalisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financier , rather than a transport man like his predecessor Sidney Garcke . With no advantages other than those of ability and personality , he had , from a start on the lowest level , soared to the top ' .15 Unlike Heaton , he avoided contacts with ministers and civil servants . His technique was to manage chiefly through the spoken word ; and he believed strongly in the clean desk ' , so that he left few if any papers for historians to study . His policies however were clear , and were successful inasmuch as , whilst Sir Frederick Heaton and Sir William Thomson expected Schemes to come into force quickly , the BET group took a different view and was able to hold aloof until the National Bus Company was formed in 1968 ? though the diversification of its interests outside the transport field was to continue at an ever-accelerating pace . A somewhat muted response to the Bill came from the Dock and Harbour Authorities Association . This was natural , since apart from the railway-owned ports ( covered by the Railway Companies Association ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction could scarcely anticipate the shape of the first Scheme . And Sir Robert Letch , 16 Regional Port Director for London and an outstanding figure in the industry , had prepared in consultation with S. S. Wilson an important paper for Hurcomb , dated 29 January 1946 . It outlined the needs of the industry for grouping , and eventually complete nationalisation , to remedy what the paper described // as the deficiencies of ports both in physical facilities and administrative and operating methods ' . Sir Robert , who was to become Deputy Chairman of the Docks and Inland Waterways Executive , carried great weight with Hurcomb and much of what his paper proposed was in fact incorporated in the Bill . " On the canals side , the situation of the railway-owned canals was curious . The railway companies , whilst opposed in principle to nationalisation , would at any time have been content to be relieved of their canal holdings , which often involved them in expenditure to meet statutory maintenance requirements for uneconomic waterways . Viable railway-owned canals , such as the Sheffield and South Yorkshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major section of the industry was in a somewhat equivocal position . It formed a Canal Joint Committee , comprising representatives of the Canal Association and the National Association of Waterway Carriers , which submitted a Statement on Post-War Polidy ' to the Ministry on 7 November 1945 . This paper laid stress on the need for investment which would require legislation and financial provision on a large scale ' , but shied away from recommending nationalisation directly . After publication of the Bill , the Joint Committee concentrated upon examination of the compensation provisions rather than developing any concerted policy of opposition . The trade unions , not unnaturally , expected to be consulted about the drafting of the Bill . But they were to be disappointed . As early as 22 January 1946 the TGWU expressed concern that the Minister had been reported as already conferring with employers . Barnes replied that he had no sense of being out of touch with the unions , but he found it difficult to discuss matters in any detail before they had gone through the Cabinet machine . By July 1946 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to mean when applied to road haulage ; it pressed this point again in October , but argument was overtaken by events since the Bill was published on 28 November . The three railway unions agreed to join forces over the Bill and they met Barnes on 24 September 1946 to express concern over worker representation on the BTC and over compensation for displaced staff . The Transport and General Workers Union also set up a small joint committee with the NUR , chiefly to deal with staff compensation . After publication of the Bill , a deputation from the three railway unions met Barnes on 22 January 1947 and urged that the members of the Railway Executive should all be full-time18 they received a nonConsultation // committal answer . The Trades Union Congress also decided to take a hand at a late stage , and on 18 March 1947 sent a deputation to the Prime Minister to express the hope that it would be consulted about the composition of the boards of all the socialised industries . As might have been expected , no undertakings were given by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoiding commitments which might restrict the government 's freedom of action.19 By and large , therefore , trade union influence upon the drafting of the Bill was insignificant . Associations representing particular groups of transport users tended to be Conservative in their political thinking and to oppose nationalisation on ideological as well as practical grounds . Both the railways and the Road Haulage Association quoted objections to nationalisation being voiced by many of the BTC 's future customers . But there was one notable exception , according to S. S. Wilson : The most successful consultations were held with the Transport Users ' Consultative Committee , a joint body of the FBI , Chambers of Commerce , National Union of Manufacturers ' etc , Sir Leonard Browett was prominent in the discussions . It was this body which eventually pushed the Minister off the C. Licence , made a number of useful suggestions and obtained several valuable concessions . ' 20 Had the railways and the road hauliers co-operated with the Ministry in this way , the unwieldy BTC might have been improved in structure . But S. S. Wilson gloomily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bill the only negotiations were with the Trade Unions and with a few traders ' organisations who wanted to know how they stood on the C. Licence . The Road Haulage Association refused to discuss anything ; the Railway Chairmen took a slightly less distant view . The result was that the Department spun its own cocoon without any assistance , either on principle , or on detail and the Bill is correspondingly the worse ' .21 4 The Bill in Parliament The passage of the Transport Bill through Parliament had three main aspects : the amount of Parliamentary time devoted to it ; the quality of the speeches on both the government and the opposition sides ; and the amendments made to the Bill before the royal assent . It is fortunate for a historian that S. S. Wilson recorded ( and has permit-ted to be quoted ) his close observations of the Parliamentary process and the personalities involved in it . The Ministry of Transport 's own analysis of the total Parliamen-tary time ( quoted by Sir Norman Chester ) ' spent on the Bill was shown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 127 Clauses and 12 Schedules , with drastic provisions for reorganising a complex and 30 // diversified industry , even this amount of time may well appear to have been inadequate . But the legislative programme of the government was so overloaded , especially with the complicated Bills for nationalisation of major industries , that the Parliamentary device of the ' guillotine ' was introduced ( by means of an ' Allocation of Time Order ' ) on 3 March 1947 . There had by then been 11 sittings of the Standing Committee , but only Clause 6 had been reached and passed . The Order allocated Clauses to individual sittings , at the end of which discussion was terminated , the next sitting moving on to consider further Clauses ; three days were allocated for the Report and one day for the Third Reading debates . The effect of the guillotine was that about 25 per cent of the Clauses and two-thirds of the Schedules were either not argued in Standing Committee or else their examination was cut short by the conclusion of the sitting . The guillotine of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of amendments , whether placed on the Order Paper by the government or the opposition . It is doubtful whether the guillotine , described by Erskine May as ' an unfortunate necessity , and not to be justified except against obstruction or by pressure of business ' was justified . The Economist commented on 3 May 1947 that ' there has never been another such case of the brutal use of the guillotine ' . S. S. Wilson remarked that ' the guillotine motion was not very well drawn ( there were no precedents for the guillotine in Standing Committee ) and as the timetable was not strictly adhered to it is probably open to some pundit to suggest that the whole proceedings were out of order ' .2 Turning from the quantity to the quality of speeches , Barnes was a poor public speaker and he stuck rigidly to the texts prepared by his ministry . S. S. Wilson commented : ' The Minister never , I think , understood much of the detail of the Bill , but he gave loyal support to any line which the government had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not know when a concession could be made without detriment ' .3 He spoke for an hour and a quarter in the Second Reading debate , almost entirely in general terms about the need for co-ordination , praising the example of transport unification represented by the LPTB . Curiously enough , no interruptions occurred when he described the highly controversial intention to limit the operation of ' C ' licence vehicles to a radius of 40 miles from their base . The chief opposition speaker was Sir David Maxwell Fyfe , 4 whose chief attack was against the granting of monopoly power over // transport , and also the organisation planned for the BTC and its Executives . He argued ? rightly , in the light of later events ? that integration was unlikely to be achieved by the establishment of functional Executives . He attacked the vagueness of the provisions relating to charges , and the excessive powers retained by the Minister over the BTC . The Liberal leader , Clement Davies , ' spoke in favour of road and rail co-ordination , but argued that this was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I would nationalise the railways and canals and have proper supervision but ... I have come to the conclusion that the structure is bad . . . this is a bad Bill ' .6 Expertise on railway subjects was not conspicuously displayed in the debate , though there were no less than 30 MPs sponsored by railway trade unions in the House ? in comparison with only two railway directors . Back-bench contributions to the debate were mostly unremarkable . Speeches on broad party lines were made by Anthony Eden and Captain Peter Thorneycroft , ' then the opposition 's shadow Minister of Transport . The government side was reinforced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer , Hugh Dalton , who stressed the advantages of cheap money which would become available for investment by the nationalised industries . However , he included a sentence which was later often to be quoted against him . I am saying that this railway system of ours is a very poor bag of physical assets ' . The last day 's debate was opened with a restrained speech by the Parliamentary Secretary to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closing speech was made in a more lively style by the Lord President of the Council , Herbert Morrison , who had of course been closely involved with the Bill 's drafting through the SI(M) Committee . On the division , there were 362 Ayes and 205 Noes , a government majority of 157 . Standing Committee B , in which work on the Bill began on 4 February 1947 , comprised fifty-one members , including thirty who were added in respect of the Transport Bill . It dealt with 805 amendments in all , 315 from the government and 490 from the opposition side . Ten of the latter were carried against the government in Committee . The guillotine however was exercised after Clause 6 had been reached ? in effect , when little more than the constitution of the BTC and its Executives had been considered . The timetable thereafter constricted discussion of such key Clauses as those covering the acquisition of railways and canals ( Clauses 12 and 13 ) , the // compulsory acquisition of long-distance road haulage ( Clauses 40 to 45 ) , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating more than forty miles from base ( Clauses 56 to 58 ) , the preparation of area schemes for passenger transport and for ports ( Clauses 67 to 71 ) , and the preparation of charges schemes ( Clauses 79 to 85 ) . S. S. Wilson was disillusioned about the proceedings . In general , the Committee stage in the House of Commons was a flop . Of the sixty members , thirty-five were Government supporters who well understood their function to provide a silent voting machine . This left fifteen or twenty regular members of the Opposition who were so flooded out with briefs from interested parties that they could take no broad view of what was involved . It is a commentary on the Parliamentary system that on a Bill which will involve direct employment for 5 per cent of the working population , and indirectly affect the remainder , the responsibility for intelligent discussion rested on less than 20 members of the Opposition . " 0 By far the most important change made in the Bill in Committee was the deletion of Clauses 56 to 58 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of C ' licence goods vehicles except with a permit issued by the licensing authority after proof of need . It had always been recognised that the restrictions on ownaccount ' transport would provoke extreme opposition from trade and industry . Barnes was very conscious also that the Co-operative movement was an extensive C ' licence vehicle operator . The dislike of the restrictions , voiced by the economists in the Cabinet Office , has already been mentioned ( p. 16 ) , as have Attlee 's own doubts on the subject . On 3 March 1946 the SI(M) Committee had had before it a note by the Lord President covering a memorandum by Douglas Jay which the Prime Minister wanted the Committee to examine , " outlining various ways in which the proposed restrictions on road goods transport could be relaxed . However , Barnes said that he did not think that the relaxations which the Government were prepared to make should be made now , since it would be useful to have something to give away in the course of proceedings through Parliament . ' ' ' By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some Ministry officials seemed to be having doubts over the C ' licences . S. S. Wilson had suggested several ways of modifying the proposals , but in the end it was the volume of opposition that caused Barnes to decide that now was the moment to give something away . He decided // not to put the issue to the SI(M) Committee but raised it in full Cabinet on 14 March 1947 in a memorandum seeking guidance on the question whether the provisions of the Transport Bill restricting the operation of C ' licence vehicles should be modified or abandoned in view of the strong opposition which they had aroused . ' In Cabinet there was general agreement that the wiser course was to abandon the proposals , which would not preclude the government from introducing further legislation at a later date to control the operation of C ' licence vehicles if events showed that their exemption from restrictions was being abused to the detriment of the public haulage system . The Cabinet thereupon agreed that the provisions of the Transport Bill restricting the operation of " C " licence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced immediately before the Standing Committee reached Clause 56 on 20 March . Clauses 56 to 58 inclusive were therefore negatived ; only fifteen minutes ' discussion took place on this crucial change , which was to affect the whole future of nationalised transport . Several Labour members expressed their regret ; Ernest Davies14 said this is one of the occasions when the guillotine boomerangs rather unhappily against us ' ( an interesting mixed metaphor ) .15 Douglas Jay and his fellow economists were very relieved . He subsequently wrote If the Labour Government in the 1947 Act had been so foolish as to forbid owners of lorries ( the " C Licensees " ) to carry their own goods in their own vehicle more than a few miles , they would not merely have been invading ordinary individual liberties much too far ... The ordinary many would have insisted that transport was made for man , and not man for transport . ' 16 But , Morrison , who had been away ill in the winter and early spring , was not at all pleased on his return to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Possibly due ? but only in part ? to a distinct lack of enthusiasm among the Co-operative Societies about surrendering their large road transport fleets , the " C " licence firms were cut out of the Bill . . . I thought this made a weakness in a plan which was undoubtedly imaginative and could have eradicated most of the troubles which beset transport to-day ... Douglas Jay had been hard at work on Attlee to get the provisions about " C " licence vehicles dropped from the Bill . " ' On 20 May the Bill went to the House of Lords where ( as is so often the case ) the political differences were less sharply defined . S. S. Wilson however noted that the Government Spokesmen frankly // knew nothing about the Bill . A team of eight had been selected ; Lord Pakenham , who moved the Second Reading , was far too occupied with Germany to take any subsequent part ; Lord Inman fell sick , with a bad attack of cold feet at the rigours of Part III ; the Lord Chancellor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special concession during the Committee stage ; Lord Nathan was competent on compensation matters , but was not popular with the Opposition ; Lord Morrison and Lord Walkden , who were desperately anxious to take a leading part , could be trusted to get anything they said wrong ; Lord Chorley spoke on occasions ; and the main burden fell on Lord Addison ( aged seventy-eight ) who , in his own words , was always " swotting up the Bill " , and provided that he still remembered the point ( which he could do for about an hour ) did magnificently .. . The Opposition was much better handled in the Lords than in the Commons . By the time the Bill reached the Lords most of the chaff had been sifted out of the Opposition amendments and the residuum contained solid stuff to which a considered answer was necessary . ' 18 In the Lords Committee , the government agreed to the enlargement of the BTC through the inclusion of part-time members , something which they had refused in the Commons . But appointment of the Executives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried against the government , was subsequently to be reversed in the Commons on consideration of the Lords ' amendments . The report stage was reached on 9 July and on 15 July the Bill was passed and returned to the Commons , where on 23 July consideration of the Lords ' amendments began . Barnes advised limiting discussion to the major issues of disagreement , which were : the Minister 's powers of direction ; the appointments to the Executives ; the constitution of an Executive for Scotland ; the doubling of the mileage limit for road haulage ; the exclusion of A ' contract licences for road vehicles and milk tankers ; the onus of proof of need ' ; subordination of the Licensing Authorities ; and the procedures for staff compensation . The government majority of course ensured that these Lords ' amendments were rejected . According to constitutional practice , the Lords did not insist ' upon their amendments and the Bill received the Royal Assent on 6 August , 1947 . The amendments placed on the Order Papers had totalled 1809 , as shown in Table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 127 Clauses of the Bill , and 15 Schedules in place of 12 . In all its essentials , the Bill came // through Parliament unscathed , the one far-reaching change , the continued freedom of own-account transport , having been in effect taken out of Parliament 's hands . The other significant changes in the Act as compared with the Bill were not many . The number of members of the BTC was raised from a maximum of four plus the chairman , all full-time , to eight , of whom four might be part-time ( Section 1(2) ) . The BTC was expressly excluded from engaging in the taxi business ( Section 2(1) ) and severe quantitative restrictions were imposed on the Commision 's power to manufacture road vehicles ? in effect preventing the BTC from entering into competition with outside industry ( Sections 2(4) and 5 ) . The general duty of the Commission was modified by enabling it to discontinue goods transport services ( Section 3(2) and ( 3 ) ) . The Minister 's powers of direction however were not modified except that his power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only to be exercised if he was satisfied that this would not prejudice the Commission 's general duty . The Transport Users ' Consultative Committees were now empowered to consider charges as well as facilities ( Section 6(7) ) . Many detailed changes were made in the Clauses relating to compensation to shareholders in the vested undertakings ' , particularly to frustrate death-bed dividends ' ( Section 18 ) . Compensation for the vesting of private owners ' wagons was to be determined by reference to a table of values contained in a new Schedule , relating these to age and type , instead of each wagon having to be valued on the basis of its age and original cost ? an obvious simplification . Rather ironically , the day that the royal assent was given ( 6 August 1947 ) was also the day in which the Prime Minister had to announce drastic measures to meet the developing economic crisis , including an extra half-hour 's work every day by coal miners , a reduction in food imports from hard currency countries , restrictions on eating in hotels // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of labour , and a reduction in the basic petrol ration . This perhaps gave some point to the anti-nationalisation poster slogan which the railway companies had displayed during the passage of the Bill : Stop the Transport Bill . You 've just had one crisis ? do you want another ? ' 5 Creating the Organisation Transforming a Bill into an Act by means of a large majority in the House of Commons was only the prelude to what might be considered a more difficult task , namely finding people of the right calibre to organise and manage the new transport colossus . Barne 's insistence ? against the arguments of some of his closest advisers such as Hurcomb and S. S. Wilson ? upon himself appointing the Members of the Executives as well as those of the Commission meant that a vast amount of patronage lay in his hands . All appointments would need to be approved by the Prime Minister ; but Attlee , always brisk and business-like , was unlikely to quibble at any recommendations that appeared sensible . However , Morrison also had to be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views to Barnes though in the end Barnes usually got his own way . On the face of it , the Chairmanship of the BTC called for an industrial leader of quite exceptional personality and experience . But Barnes had not moved in the world of big business except with the special atmosphere of the Co-operative Movement . He decided to play safe by entrusting the Commission 's leadership to the man who had worked most closely with him in Ministry and who could be trusted to fulfil the statutory duties of the BTC with meticulous care , namely Hurcomb . The fact that Hurcomb was of retiring age , and was essentially an administrator rather than a businessman , does not seem to have weighed with Barnes or induced him to consider any alternative appointment . Certainly , although the complexity of the problems which the BTC would face might seem to demand a Chairman with transport knowledge and experience , a man drawn from any one sector of the industry ( for instance , a railway manager ) might not be trusted by those Executives comprising former competitors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long years in the Ministry had given him considerable opportunities of appraising the qualities of the chief leaders of the transport industry . He was on excellent personal terms with figures such as Sir William Wood , President of the LMS Railway , and Lord Ashfield of the LPTB , for instance . It is however necessary to consider Hurcomb 's own personality in relation to the enormous demands of his new position . Unquestionably he retained his intellectual powers . He had a phenomenal memory 38 // and the ability to grasp very quickly the essentials of any problem laid before him . His use of written English was admirable , eschewing both casualness on the one hand , and official pomposity on the other . He could greatly improve almost any document placed before him in draft , working rapidly with a small stub of pencil ( he never seemed to possess a new pencil ! ) . But at meetings , the firmness he had shown during the war over , for instance , shipping policy now seemed to have been replaced by obstinacy and a tendency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expect those with whom he dealt always to be reasonable ; and when his arguments failed to persuade people to adopt the reasonable ' attitude , he became extremely irritated . Yet he disliked having to over-rule subordinate authorities , perhaps due to the civil service tradition of departmental rather than individual responsibility for decision-making ; and he issued formal directives only with reluctance . Speakers in the debates on the Transport Bill , as well as press commentators , had drawn attention to the difficult nature of the statutory relationship between the Commission and its Executives , and wondered where the real power would lie . To overcome these difficulties , a Chairman of the BTC with quite exceptional powers of leadership was needed , since personal relationships , above all with the Chairmen of the Executives , could be expected to play an important part . But Hurcomb , for all his formidable intellectual powers and wide experience , was fundamentally a shy and often rather a distrustful man . Someone of perhaps less distinguished intellect , but gifted with the ability to make friends quickly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach a better understanding with the Executives and the trade unions , in ways needed to weld the undertaking together . But Hurcomb had no misgivings about taking on the new task , as in later years he recalled . After working with Alf Barnes ( and at one remove with Herbert Morrison again ) for two years in complete mutual confidence and advising him throughout on the Transport Bill ( Act of 1947 ) I could not refuse his request and indeed flattering offer to become Chairman of the new Transport Commission . ( I had just before told Manny Shinwell , ' then Minister of Fuel , who had offered me the deputy chairmanship of the new Electricity Authority , that I felt bound to leave myself in the Government 's hand and must ask him to consult his colleagues as to what they wished me to do . ) I realised how formidable a task it was likely to be and that , at 65 , it // would close my active career . But I felt equal to the strain and my wife 's death in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would have been if we could have travelled and amused ourselves together . ' z The Chairman 's salary was agreed by Dalton , the Chancellor , at ? 8500 ; but since Hurcomb was entitled to his Civil Service pension of ? 2000 it was suggested by the Treasury ( in a letter dated 16 August 1947 ) that he should only draw ? 6500 ; Barnes objected and eventually ? 7000 was agreed . ' The Treasury seems to have had a curiously myopic vision of the salaries which leading industrialists should command . The BTC was vastly greater than the prewar LMS Railway ? yet Lord Stamp , its former President , had enjoyed a salary of ? 15 000 , as had Lord Ashfield at London Transport . Hurcomb 's view of the background of the Members that he would desire to work with him in the BTC was shown in a minute to Barnes dated 10 January 1947 , in which he wrote : One Member will have to devote his main attention to Finance and Rates and Charges . Another should devote himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably be mainly concerned with Labour and Staff questions . The fourth ... could well devote himself mainly to ensuring a proper co-ordination between the different Executives and the different forms of transport . ' 4 Although Ministry papers do not reveal how the names came to be selected to fill these posts as outlined by Hurcomb ( in all probability , conclusions were reached in private discussion between Hurcomb and Barnes ) , the specification for the first post points to Sir William Wood , ' who had worked with Hurcomb in the Ministry after the 1914 ? 18 war for a time and who was greatly respected by him . No steps were taken to find a scientist or engineer for the second position to deal with technical problems including Research and Development ' . Instead , Barnes appointed Lord Rusholme , ' General Secretary of the Co-operative Union . John Benstead , ' General Secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen , as the leader of the largest trade union with which the Commission would have to deal , was an obvious choice for the third position ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite his age , to give the BTC the benefit of his vast experience , in the fourth position . ' A breif character sketch of these initial nominees may not be out of place . Sir William Wood , now aged 64 , an acute brain and a very attractive personality , was extremely modest for a man who had attained the topmost position in the whole railway industry . He // suffered from a small handicap in that his Ulster brogue , coupled with a habit of speaking very rapidly and quietly ( reflecting the rapidity of his thought ) , and often without removing a cigarette from his mouth , made conversation with him rather difficult . On the railway he had been served by a devoted staff , who , from long practice , could read his mind clearly even if his actual words were indistinct . He had never expected to reach the prominence into which he was thrust by the death of Lord Stamp in an air raid and he both needed and received support , in the Presidency of the LMS , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was steadily to decline throughout his Membership of the BTC , because he appeared relatively ineffective in these unfamiliar surroundings . That was a pity , because his financial and accounting attainments were backed by a wide knowledge of railway history , technology and policy ; he was no cloistered accountant . And , late in life , he had come to support the concept of transport integration as a logical extension of the rationalisation policies which the LMS railway had carried through , largely as a result of his costing studies . Lord Ashfield , who had reached the age of seventy-three , did not yet appear to show much loss of his former intellectual powers ; but he was soon to be overtaken by a fatal illness . In the new surroundings of the BTC he seemed to decline from the unquestioned authority which he had wielded in London Transport . Lord Rusholme had been a very effective General Secretary of the Co-operative Union , with which Barnes had had almost life-long connections ; but he had no transport background , a fact which he candidly admitted . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his considerable powers as an administrator , which unfortunately were never to be properly exercised under Hurcomb . His method of work was business-like and brisk , based upon effective delegation and applying sound commonsense to every question , rather than any Socialist or doctrinaire approach . He was invariably courteous to the BTC staff , by whom he was held in high regard . Some expressed regret that he was not given a more important role ; Hurcomb 's failure to do this may have been one reason for Rusholme 's continued residence in Manchester , staying at an hotel in London for about four days in the week . Benstead , aged fifty , was the youngest Member . He was a capable organiser and skilful at handling political issues , in which he was not a doctrinaire Socialist so much as a practical , careerist official . His native East Midlands burr was overlaid with a Kensingtonian ' accent , and this seemed to give a clue to his complex character . His // manner could vary from the bluff and bonhomous to the cold and ruthless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult situations . These appointments were all formalised by a minute of appointment signed by Barnes and dated 8 September 1947 . Ten days later , by a subsequent minute , Barnes appointed Captain Sir Ian Bolton , ' Bart , OBE , to be a part-time Member of the Commission . This nomination answered those who had pleaded the advantages of including some part-time members , and also the pressure for representation of Scottish interests , since Sir Ian was a distinguished figure in Glasgow financial circles , a partner in a leading firm of accountants , and had been a Scottish director of the LMS railway . Although crippled , he moved with astonishing agility with the aid of a single crutch . He was quick and animated in discussion . Salaries for the BTC members were agreed by the Chancellor at ? 5000 for full-time Members and ? 1000 for the part-time one . Wood 's position was an extremely strong one since he enjoyed a very substantial pension from the LMS railway . Ashfield also was a relatively wealthy man . Their new salaries were attractive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated by the refusal of the NUR to allow him to continue membership of its pension fund , and Treasury objections to making his BTC service pensionable . It took some years before the latter point was conceded . The Times recorded the appointment of the Transport Commissioners ' ( a short-lived title for the Members ) without editorial remark upon their qualifications ; but the Financial Times had a barbed comment , that Age is the price of experience , in transport as elsewhere , and the average age of the Commission is not low ... everyone will wish them good fortune , for they will need it ' .10 Twenty years later , a senior civil servant who had himself been closely associated with the nationalisation programmes of the Attlee government wrote : This was an incredible weight of responsibility to lay on a small group of men ' . " The newly appointment Members began work almost immediately to prepare for vesting day less than four months ahead . They needed accommodation , staff , and settled procedures . The problem of accommodation was quickly settled to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ashfield offered Hurcomb office space on the eighth and ninth floors in the London Transport headquarters at 55 Broadway , SW1 , which Hurcomb accepted reaCreating // dily , because it would enable him to remain in the familiar purlieus of Westminster and Whitehall ; he would have felt an exile in some railway headquarters . Lord Ashfield 's convenience was admirably suited , since he was not put under the necessity of vacating the elegant LPTB Chairman 's room which had been his since 1929 . These satisfactions were not shared by Lord Latham , ' 2 Ashfield 's successor at London Transport , who was unable to occupy the chairman 's room until Ashfield 's death in November 1948 . Nor were they shared by the ejected London Transport staff , who had to be rehoused ; nor by the staff of the BTC who found the attic floors in 55 Broadway inconvenient and Spartan . The Commission would obviously need officers . Hurcomb 's minute to Barnes of 10 January 1947 had suggested that there should be a Secretary who might also deal with some of the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a chief executive officer of the calibre of , say , a railway General Manager . ) However , it was necessary to offer some senior position to Miles Beevor , " then Acting Chief General Manager of the LNER . He had been the railway 's Chief Legal Adviser since 1943 and had been selected by the LNER board in June 1947 to succeed Sir Charles Newton as CGM , though Barnes would only agree to an acting appointment in view of pending nationalisation . Beevor therefore was appointed Chief Secretary and Legal Adviser to the BTC . He was temperamentally more of a manager than a lawyer . He had , like so many railway officers , been opposed in principle to nationalisation but , now that it was a fait accompli , he was prepared to make it work . In fact , he was far-sighted enough to see that transport integration was probably the best guarantee of railway survival in future . He was entitled to expect that he would be the chief executive of the BTC and a significant force in shaping transport policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes of establishing the new order in an effective manner . But Hurcomb 's relations with him were to be very different from those of a railway Chairman with his General Manager . A minor irritant to the BTC 's staff was that the accommodation arrangements approved by Hurcomb were unsatisfactory . Hurcomb 's own room was of a peculiar shape with a large supporting column in the middle , though this did not disturb him , accustomed as he was to civil service standards . A clerk was released from London Transport to allocate rooms to the Commissioners ' and soon two typists followed , also on loan ; but telephones and messenger services had to // be organised entirely from scratch . For a considerable time the BTC , with annual receipts in the region of ? 500 million , had no cash of its own . Small payments such as out-of-pocket expenses could only be made by advances from the London Transport cash office . The Commission 's head office had no entrance or reception arrangements apart from those of London Transport . This dependence upon what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BTC 's staff . Normally , a post in the head office of a huge industrial enterprise would be regarded as conferring some prestige ; this was not the experience within the Commission during the early years . " The Commission met twice a week , on Tuesdays and Thursdays . It soon became apparent that the concept of a full-time body devoid of executive functions , and concerning itself exclusively with policy ' , raised difficulties . Even Hurcomb began to recognise this ; he once said to the present author : After all , policy has to be about something . ' How in fact were the Members to occupy their time , when not sitting in meetings ? Hurcomb resolved this in part by allotting individuals to particular aspects of the BTC 's future role ? Sir William Wood to oversee charges policy ; Benstead , labour , establishment and organisational questions ; and Lord Rusholme , special enquiries , acting as a kind of superior odd-job man . Lord Ashfield was expected to give sage advice on integration ' in the capacity of an elder statesman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BTC was not that of a board of directors entrusting wide powers to a chief executive . Beevor was expected to assume more of a secretarial than executive role , which was little to his taste . He obtained authority to recruit three Assistant Secretaries , covering respectively Staff and Establishment , Works and Development , and Traffic , in addition to an Assistant Solicitor . But the fact that Beevor was not the BTC 's chief executive was underlined by the appointment of R. H. Wilson , 15 as the Comptroller ' , reporting direct to the Commission . Wilson was well known to Hurcomb through his work in the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of War Transport . He set up a substantial organisation , with sections headed by Directors ' , to deal with the major financial tasks that would fall on the BTC immediately after vesting day , throwing himself into this task with great energy and enthusiasm . He decided to demonstrate that the BTC was indeed an integrated ' body through the presentation of its financial accounts , coupled with a statistical portrait of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind . He had had , whilst still in the Ministry , reservations about the // peculiar constitution of a Commission with Executives , and would have preferred a more commercial concept , such as a holding company with subsidiary operating companies ; but he plunged with gusto into rationalising the finances of the huge bundle of undertakings which the BTC was to inherit . Hurcomb would have liked Beevor to take as Deputy Secretary the man who knew most of all about the Transport Act , namely S. S. Wilson . Wilson was in fact interviewed for the post by Benstead , but decided not to accept ; the position was then earmarked for S. B. Taylor , 16 who would , apart from nationalisation , have been confirmed in his acting appointment as Secretary of the Great Western Railway . Taylor was shrewd and careful , but no innovator ; he was an excellent foil to the energetic and sometimes impatient Beevor . Hard on the heels of the BTC appointments came those to the Executives . As early as 12 September Barnes announced the names of the Railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 November . The Chairman was Sir Eustace Missenden , " General Manager of the Southern Railway . The post had been earlier offered to Sir James Milne , 18 General Manager of the Great Western Railway , but Milne had already been soured by Barnes 's refusal to allow him to accept a seat on the GWR Board , to which the Directors had elected him in 1947 , on the grounds that this would be incompatible with his responsibility to the Minister as a member of the Railway Executive Committee . Milne proposed a trial appointment of one year ; Barnes rejected this and also told Milne that Chairmanship of the Railway Executive would exclude holding any outside directorships , whereupon Milne withdrew completely.19 The only railway General Manager then left in the market was Missenden of the Southern , aged 61 , who was accordingly approached and accepted the Chairmanship . Missenden was a highly practical railwayman , but he lacked experience of the business world and the familiarity with politicians and civil servants which had been gained by such railway leaders as Lord Stamp and Sir James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it was made clear that he was not to be in authority over the functional Members of the Executive , but a chairman at meetings , a co-ordinator and a spokesman for the railways.20 Missenden 's career had comprised a steady rise from the lowly post of booking clerk on the South Eastern &; Chatham Railway to the General Manager 's chair at Waterloo , based on sheer professional competence , mainly in the operating function . His was not a warm or // extrovert personality , and some Southern Railway officers disliked the way in which he had persuaded the Board to appoint him substantive , not merely Acting General Manager when his chief and the nominal incumbent , Gilbert Szlumper , was released for war service.21 Missenden was not an original or deep thinker , but he was shrewd and was good at delegating ; he was usually careful to reward those who had served him well . The appointment of V. M. Barrington-Ward ( aged 60 ) as the Member with responsibility for operating , docks and marine matters was a logical one.22 ' B-W ' as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been Chairman of the Railway Executive Committee 's Operating Committee throughout the war and was consequently well known in Ministry circles . His physical presence inspired confidence ; he was slim , tall , clean-shaven , with a high colour and an austere manner . ' B-W ' was famous for his taciturnity ; he was accustomed to give quick decisions without having to justify them . He came of a distinguished family , numbering among his brothers an Editor of The Times , a well-known surgeon , and a dignitary of the Church of England . He was not himself intellectually remarkable , but his professional competence earned him general respect . The personality of David Blee , 23 appointed Member with responsibility for Commercial and Continental matters ( and also temporarily for hotels and catering ) was very different . His appointment arose largely as a consequence of the need to secure a balance between the four grouped railway companies around the Executive 's meetingtable . Milne 's declining of the chairmanship ( and also the refusal of A. S. Quartermaine , Chief Engineer of the Great Western Railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option but to fill the Commercial Member 's post with a GWR man , though Sir Reginald Hill , the Deputy Director General , had urged Hurcomb to consider F. A. Pope , a Vice-Presdient of the LMS who was however destined shortly to move to the chairmanship of the Ulster Transport Authority . Blee was a zealous , ambitious railway officer whose chief interest lay in marketing . He was extremely hard-working and was liked by his subordinates . This esteem was not always fully shared by his Executive colleagues , who found him long-winded both in discussion and on paper . And Hurcomb , with his splendid command of English , was irritated by what he considered turgid passages in papers written by Blee and forwarded to the Commission . As the youngest Member of // the RE , however , ( aged 48 ) Blee might have hoped eventually to become Chairman . The Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Member of the Executive was Robert A. ( ' Robin ' ) Riddles , 24 CBE , aged fifty-four , who had been a Vice-President of the LMS railway and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war . Whilst he was a very competent production engineer , he also retained an infectious enthusiasm for the steam locomotive , which was in later years to call his judgment in question ; but it rather added to the personal charm which he could exhibit . He had been brought up in a department traditionally dominated by autocratic Chief Mechanical Engineers , so that the exercise of authority in his function came naturally to him ; he was impatient of argument or questioning , particularly from a body such as the BTC whose technical expertise he did not recognise . Riddles was also in charge of Scientific Research and Road Motor Engineering matters . The Civil Engineering Member was J. C. L. Train , 25 former Chief Engineer of the LNER , aged fifty-eight . Train , a tall craggy Scot , added a shrewd political sense to his professional competence ; this was later to serve him well and bring him a knighthood in 1957 . Train covered , in addition to civil engineering , the signal and telecommunications function and the department of the Architect , thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railways . His relations with Missenden were slightly frigid . The obligatory Member from the trade unions was W. P. Allen , CBE , 26 General Secretary of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen , who was responsible for labour and establishment , welfare , and medical matters . Bill Allen ' , as he was universally known , was a less complex character than his opposite number on the BTC , Benstead . He was short , plump , with a moustache well waxed at the ends , and had a friendly , unassuming manner which rapidly produced a good rapport with his new colleagues on the management side of the negotiating table . His approach to staff and labour questions was pragmatic and free from any political flavour . He worked well as the member of a team and the politics of envy had no part in his make-up . The Executive 's complement of full-time members was filled by the appointment of a very distinguished figure from outside the railway world , General Sir William Slim , GBE , KCB , DSO , MC.27 General Slim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , // public relations and advertising , estate and rating and police matters . However , he almost immediately obtained the respect and indeed the warm regard of his professional railway colleagues by his quick grasp of the business and at the same time his friendly and unassuming attitude towards them . It was a matter of great regret to all his colleagues when he resigned in October 1948 on being appointed Chief of the Imperial General Staff . Two part-time members of the Executive were also appointed by Barnes , namely Mr C. Nevile , 28 who represented agricultural interests , and Sir Wilfrid Ayre , 29 to represent Scottish interests . Neither was destined to play an important part in the work of the Executive . Mr Nevile suffered from a stutter which rather impaired his effectiveness at meetings , and Sir Wilfrid Ayre only participated in discussions which touched on Scotland or shipbuilding . ( Looking ahead , it may be mentioned that Nevile 's appointment was not renewed when it expired in 1950 , and Ayre declined a renewal that was offered him at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed by Dalton at ? 5000 . For both Barrington-Ward and Train this represented an increment of ? 500 on their previous LNER emoluments ; but Riddles had enjoyed a salary of ? 6000 on the LMS and was thus granted a personal allowance ' of ? 1000 . Blee 's salary on the GWR had been ? 4000 , so that he received a substantial advance . Missenden 's salary as Chairman was ? 7000.3 ? The problem of accommodation was solved quickly . The RE was soon housed in the former Great Central Hotel opposite Marylebone Station , re-designated 222 Marylebone Road . Planning permission for office use had been refused to the LNER , but was granted when the BTC renewed the application on behalf of the Railway Executive . The Transport Act contained elaborate provisions regarding the powers and duties of the Commission , but said nothing regarding the organisation below the level of the Executives which were to manage the various businesses . Nor had the speeches of Barnes or other government spokesmen given any clear idea of what was in mind after vesting day ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be avoided , in answer to criticisms in Parliament . Between the royal assent and vesting day , less than four months was available to make the necessary preparations . The Commission was chiefly concerned about the organisation of the railways . London Transport would clearly be little affected , as it was already an integrated ' , compact , management unit ; the Docks and Inland // aterways Executive presented only minor problems , since the ilway-owned docks , comprising much the most important compoent , were temporarily to remain under railway management . There as no urgency about setting up the Hotels Executive ; and the Road ransport Executive would not start to exercise any major role until the programme for acquisition of long-distance road haulage undertakings got under way . As soon as the membership of the Railway Executive was known , the Commission started to enquire as to its intentions and proposals on organisation . Obviously the simplest course would have been merely to retain the management structures of the four grouped companies , except that the Executive would be substituted for the four boards of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would not have sufficiently demonstrated an immediate move into unification ' . So devolution below Executive level was raised as a matter of urgency by the BTC . The first step was to ask the Railway Research Service , an information bureau funded by the four main line railways , for a memorandum describing the main patterns of railway organisation throughout the world . This was quickly furnished and placed before the Commission on 17 September . At this meeting Hurcomb suggested that the problem was to what extent the Railway Executive should decentralise the present railway organisations . Should there be a limited number of area officers interposed between the Railway Executive in London and the present local District Officers of the railway companies , located at large industrial centres , and could such Officers be given a considerable measure of authority to deal with commercial and possibly some operating questions arising in their particular area ? ' 3 ' This suggests a curiously tentative , almost amateurish approach to questions of railway organisation , in view of the fund of professional knowledge already available . It illustrates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service to a managerial role . The Executive at a meeting with the BTC on 2 October proposed a simple organisation based on five areas ; one for Scotland , and the other four based on the existing main line companies , though with the LMS and the LNER shorn of their Scottish lines . Hurcomb hedged on this , saying that the aim was not to perpetuate the four old areas but to reorganise the unified system in a way which would avoid undue centralisation in London ' . Both Lord Ashfield and Benstead asked for consideration to be given to further subdivision of the exLMS and ex-LNER areas.32 // At a further meeting on 27 October between the BTC and the RE the idea of eight regions , including one for Wales , was put forward as an eventual solution ; but only two days later , the Executive wrote to the Commission stating that it would be possible to sub-divide the exLNER in England into an Eastern Area ' and a North Eastern Area ' , and to this ? since it went part of the way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed . In any case , time was getting very short , since the Executive had now only eight weeks in which to prepare the administrative arrangements for the changeover . A railway officer , A. J. Pearson , 33 was commissioned to put in hand the drafting of the key documents issued to the officers of the new Regions ' ? this term now being adopted in preference to Area ' . Instruction no. 1 came into effect on 1 January 1948 , addressed to the officers in the new Regions situated as follows : Eastern Region ( headquarters Liverpool Street Station , London ) Western Region ( headquarters Paddington station , London ) London Midland Region ( headquarters Euston station , London ) North Eastern Region ( headquarters York ) Scottish Region ( headquarters Glasgow ) Southern Region ( headquarters Waterloo station , London ) . The Regions comprised rather more than just the systems of the four grouped railways , because in the Third Schedule to the Transport Act , no less than fifty-four other railway undertakers ' were to be vested in the BTC . Of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there were a few independent minor railways such as the Kent &; East Sussex Light Railway Company . The task of allocating each of them to a designated single Region was completed by 1 January 1948 . In addition , a number of joint lines ( main line and LPTB ) were absorbed into the system of the London Transport Executive . Instruction no. 1 , in addition to defining the railway system to be comprised within each Region , set out for information the Members of the Executive and the organisational lines of responsibility . The main feature was the dual responsibility of departmental officers to a Chief Regional Officer for all matters coming within the latter 's functions and in all other respects to the appropriate Member of the Railway Executive , who will lay down principles . ' Thus was formalised the functional character of the organisation , intended to unify ' the practices of the four railway companies and assist in obtaining economies expected from standardisation . In order // that Regional ( or former company ) loyalties should not impede realisation of this objective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not general managers : Hurcomb told one of them There can be no question of Regional general management ' .34 No such elaborate preliminary planning was required in the case of the London Transport Executive . The Members were all familiar faces at 55 Broadway . Lord Latham , the Chairman , had been a Member of the LPTB since 1935 , and John Cliff since 1933.35 The appointments of the other three full-time Members ? A. H. Grainger , 36 L. C. Hawkins37 and A. B. B , Valentine38 are discussed in Chapter 12 . Three part-time Members were also appointed , Sir Richard Burbidge , 39 Sir Edward Hardy , 40 and T. E. Williams ( soon to be Lord Williams ) .41 ( Sir Ewart Smith , a Deputy Chairman of ICI , had declined an offer made to him . ) A tentative and curious suggestion from Barnes that R. A. Riddles might join the Executive was squashed in a letter from Hurcomb to Barnes dated 28 August 1947.42 These appointments might well have been made with the intention of disturbing the procedures of London Transport as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been proposed by Dalton at ? 3000 ; Barnes had objected and in a letter dated 29 July 1947 from Dalton a concession of ? 3500 was made , though the Chancellor added my personal feeling is that some of these salaries are really too high ' .43 In fact , however , in order to maintain their previous salaries from the LPTB , personal allowances ' above the Executive standard had to be given to Hawkins ( ? 1500 ) and to Valentine and Grainger ( ? 500 each ) . The part-time members received salaries of ? 750 . The Docks and Inland Waterways Executive was constituted only at the last minute before vesting day , by a minute of appointemnt dated 23 December 1947 . The Chairman Barnes appointed was Sir Reginald Hill , who by then had become a Deputy Secretary in the Ministry of Transport . The other three full-time Members included Sir Robert Letch , who had been Assistant General Manager of the Port of London Authority and Chairman of the National Association of Port Employers ; Robert Davidson , 44 formerly General Manager and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donovan , 45 formerly National Secretary of the Docks Group of the Transport and General Workers Union . Three part-time Members were also appointed ? George Cadbury ; 46 Sir Herbert McNeill ; 47 and Sir Ernest // On vesting day eighteen canals ( listed individually in Part 2 of the Third Schedule to the Act ) were vested in the Executive , but the docks // ( by far the most important component of the Executive 's business ) remained for the time being with the Railway Executive , into whose hands they had fallen automatically with the railway undertakings ' . The same applied to the railway-owned canals , of course ; but it may be commented that the Railway Executive was much readier to hand over the latter as quickly as possible , than in the case of the docks . Accommodation for the Docks and Inland Waterways Executive was found temporarily in St John 's Wood , but the headquarters was soon able to move into two houses in Dorset Square , Marylebone , which the LNER had adapted in 1945 as the railway Chief General Manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evacuation centre , the pre-war accommodation at Kings ' Cross Station having been destroyed by enemy action . The characters of Sir Reginald Hill and Sir Robert Letch could hardly have been more different . Hill had been a very sound ' civil servant and , though in no way a leader of men , was a cultured personality . He found the history and geography of the canals fascinating and concentrated his interest upon this aspect of the Executive 's work , despite its relatively minor financial and commercial significance . Letch had been strongly recommended by Hurcomb to Barnes for appointment as a possible Deputy Chairman of the Executive , in a minute dated 29 August 1947 , which Barnes had accepted . Letch was thus left to take virtually sole charge of the docks side , in which his abilities were to have full play . He was a man of strong likes and dislikes , on occasion ruthless , and yet capable of sentiment ; he once spent hours by the bedside of a dying colleague , deeply distressed . His fight , astonishingly successful , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sense of power which could be exercised either benignly or in the exercise of dictatorial authority . Soon the contrast between Hill , touring the canals and reporting upon their quainter features , and the blind Letch , effectively controlling a great docks empire chiefly by telephone , became noticeable . The standard salaries for Executives , of ? 5000 for Chairmen and ? 3500 for Members , were applied to the DIWE ( Letch 's salary with the PLA had been only ? 3000 ) .49 Before any Executive could exercise its statutory powers it was necessary under Section 5 of the Transport Act for the Commission , with the approval of the Minister , to make a Scheme of Delegation . Accordingly , Schemes were prepared on 22 November for the Railway Executive , on 5 December for the London Transport Executive , // and on 23 December for the Docks and Inland Waterways Executive . All the Schemes took effect on 1 January 1948 . During 1948 supplementary Delegations were made , tidying-up various minor activities , and , more importantly , conferring powers on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , the Road Transport Executive and the Hotels Executive . The Act had provided only that the Hotels Executive should be appointed as from the appointed day ' , whereas the RTE was listed with the other Executives , so presumably had been intended to be created on vesting day along with them . In the event , however , the RTE was not constituted until appointments were formally made by a minute dated 8 March 1948 , although they had been publicly announced at the beginning of the year . The Chairmanship had created some problems . At an interview , Barnes had offered it informally to H. T. Dutfield , 50 the chairman of the Road Haulage Association and then , apparently after an objection from Hurcomb , withdrew the offer . It was also understood that C. A. Birtchnell of the Ministry of Transport was interested in the post , but that Hurcomb , who was not on the best of terms with him , had blocked the appointment , 51 despite the fact that Birtchnell 's experience in creating the wartime Road Transport Organisation might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consolation of being promoted to Deputy Secretary in the Ministry , and in due course knighted . ) Eventually a surprise appointment was made . The post of Deputy Secretary to the BTC had been publicly advertised , and among the applicants was Major-General G. N. Russell , CB , CBE , 52 a professional soldier who had played a distinguished part in the 1939 ? 45 war in the transport sector . Charles Russell , as he was universally known , was an energetic , extrovert , often outspoken character . He greatly impressed Miles Beevor at a preliminary interview and , although the BTC did not retreat from the decision to appoint Taylor , Hurcomb proposed Russell to Barnes as a man likely to make a success of the RTE , and the appointment duly went through . One of his officers in the Road Transport ( later the Road Haulage ) Executive describes him as conspicuously hard working , energetic in seeing for himself , voluble , sometimes irascible ( never one to suffer fools gladly ) , he soon became well-known and popular throughout the organisation ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trade journal Commercial Motor at first wrote rather sourly : We think that someone more intimately connected with the industry should have // been appointed . ' S4 But soon that paper was to be writing about Russell in distinctly complimentary terms . The next Member to be appointed was Claud Barrington , " born 1893 , from 1923 a director of Carey , Davis &; Thomas Ltd , and now Managing Director of Transport Services Ltd , a substantial group of haulage companies soon to be acquired by the Commission . He was a strong believer in grouping of road haulage businesses and he had an engineering background which was to prove very valuable in organising this side of the nationalised road haulage business . Barrington has been described as somewhat over-awed by General Russell . He was a financier , a City type rather than a practical haulier and had come from a financial group within the Drayton empire ' .56 The Member representing the road passenger side was George Cardwell , " a director of Thomas Tilling Ltd . He was well known and liked throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ; his appointment foreshadowed the early acquisition by the BTC of the non-railway interests in the Tilling group of companies , bringing them into virtually 100 per cent national ownership . Negotiations with Sir Frederick Heaton to this effect were in fact inaugurated by R. H. Wilson , the Comptroller of the Commission , very soon after vesting day . Harold E. Clay , 58 former Assistant General Secretary of the TGWU , was one full-time ex-trade unionist Member ; another was Archibald Henderson , 59 who had been Chairman of Traffic Commissioners and the Licensing Authority for Scotland , but had formerly been an officer of the TGWU . A former colleague has written : Archie Henderson and Harold Clay came to RTE from the same stable , the Transport and General Workers Union , both upholders of Ernest Bevin . They were said to have been keen rivals in that unwieldy organisation . Certainly , in their new role , they were often to be found on opposite sides of the argument and there was sometimes a certain coolness ; but at the end of the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumoured that they had at one time been driver and conductor of the same Leeds tram ! ... Archie Henderson was , basically , a party-political animal who fought his way through the hurly-burly of Labour and Trade Union politics .. . Harold Clay was a small , " Father-figure " of a man ... he would have made a good Parish Priest in a rural community . Generally gentle , but ? as befitted his Trade Union background ? quick to put on the gloves if need be and never fearing to stand out against his old colleague , Archie Henderson ' . bo // Three part-time Members were also appointed by Barnes . W. Becket was a trade unionist ( not from a transport union ) who was at the time Deputy Mayor of Preston ( he had been Mayor in the previous year ) . He had had long experience of local government and had been associated with the organisation of municipal transport . Percy J. R. Tapp , aged sixty , as Chairman of the Meat Transport Organisation Ltd , had played a major part in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Organisation . The third part-time appointment caused surprise ? that of Henry Dutfield . Modern Transport described him as the popular chairman of the National Road Transport Federation ' and he was generally considered as the doughty commander of the anti-nationalisation brigade . The paper however commented that Dutfield had hinted in a lecture to the Institute of Transport on 8 December 1947 that he might accept nationalisation as having advantages as well as disadvantages , and since then the Road Haulage Association 's Executive committee had unanimously approved of its Chairman accepting the Minister 's invitation.61 Dutfield 's appointment was clearly intended to sweeten relations between the new Executive , armed with all its compulsory purchase and licensing powers , and the private sector of the industry . In any case , the group to which his own firm belonged was down for early acquisition by the BTC and Dutfield 's acceptance of his new role was realistic . In the hope that it would somehow promote the realisation of road and rail integration ' , the Commission insisted that the Road Transport Executive should share 222 Marylebone Road with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made ready . This was not at first welcomed by the Executive , which was being temporarily housed in St Pancras Chambers ( the former Midland Grand Hotel , long since converted into makeshift offices by the LMS railway ) . Nearly all office services were lacking there , but the move to Marylebone Road was seen as little improvement . Executive minute 3 of 3 February 1948 recorded that It would be more satisfactory if the Road Transport Executive headquarters were not situated in the same building as the Railway Executive . It was felt to be essential to avoid giving colour to any suggestion of road services being secondary to Railways . ' Two days later , at a meeting between the BTC and the RTE , according to the minutes , the Executive expressed some dissatisfaction with the accommodation at St Pancras Chambers , and with their // future move to 222 Marylebone Road . They felt that there would be an undesirable reaction from the road interests if the Executive were situated " under the railways ' roof " . The Executive got short shrift from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the integration of all forms of transport , and to facilitate this it was the intention of the Commission that all the Executives should be in as close proximity as possible . ' 62 Accordingly , the RTE was soon established on the fourth floor of the ex-Great Central Hotel , its officers sharing the RE officers " mess ' ( railway terminology in these matters following that of the Services ) . Whether such physical proximity in fact achieved any meeting of minds , or any replacing of correspondence by personal contacts , is very doubtful . Even in the mess , the RTE officers sat together and seldom mixed with the railwaymen . Before very long , they moved to a separate mess ' . The last Executive to be set up , the Hotels Executive , did not come into being until 7 June , 1948 . After a surprising amount of what can only be described as dithering over the appointments , it comprised Lord Inman as Chairman , 63 one full-time Member , F. G. Hole , ' and three part-time Members , Mrs E. H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. W. Wimble.6 ' The curious way in which the Executive was created is set out in Chapter 13 , which deals with its chequered history . The Executive was temporarily housed in the former LMS Railway offices at Euston station , but soon moved to 222 Marylebone Road , as additional floors in that building were made fit for use . With the appointments to the Hotels Executive , Barnes had made a total of forty-three member appointments ? twenty-eight full-time and fifteen part-time . He had thus made considerable concessions to those who had pressed in Parliament for part-time appointments in order to draw upon a wide range of talent and experience . To identify the most suitable appointees , to make offers , and negotiate conditions where problems arose , was a very considerable task . In the first place , there was not , in 1947 , a comprehensive list of the good and the great ' naming people who might be suitable for different forms of public service , though apparently the Treasury had some sort of list which was not generally circulated . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of professional and technical staff , kept in the Ministry of Labour ; and that department made an attempt to extend its activities over the socialised industries . In a letter from the Director of Appointments , A. Gunn , to Thomas Padmore of the // Treasury dated 17 July 1946 , Gunn wrote I would like to suggest .. . that all vacancies for temporary appointments to these Boards .. . should be handled by the Appointments Department . In addition , if it is necessary to advertise some of the high-level posts for staff . . . I would like to see advertisement done through the Appointments Department ' . ' ' This attempt at departmental empire-building was circulated to the ministries sponsoring nationalised industries . Hurcomb does not appear to have taken any notice of it . He had already received from S. S. Wilson a tenative list of names of persons who might be considered for appointment to the Commission or Executives ; it was made up as follows : Table It included various elderly figures in the transport world such as Sir Osborne Mance ( aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , editor of The Economist ( future Lord Crowther ) , and Gilbert Ponsonby , lecturer in transport at the London School of Economics and a wartime temporary civil servant . The list does not appear to have been used by Barnes or Hurcomb.69 Looking at the total of forty-three appointments made by Barnes , a classification by background yields the following result : // It is not easy to trace any principles ? Socialist of otherwise ? in this list . Most of the appointments would appear to have been made by Barnes on an ad hoc basis . Consultation with the Commission was required by the Act , but in practice this boiled down to discussions with Hurcomb , whose views seem always to have been accepted by his colleagues . Barnes 's personal connection with the Co-operative movement was no doubt reflected in his appointments of Rusholme , Williams and Wimble ; but it had not been until late in August 1947 ? too late in fact to influence Barnes , one might conclude ? that the Parliamentary Committee of the Co-operative Congress asked if it could submit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were already far advanced . The trade unions were no more successful in obtaining either worker control or direct worker representation at the highest level in nationalised transport . At the meeting with Barnes on 24 September 1946 the railway unions had ? among other matters ? asked for the opportunity to submit nominations for representation of the workers on the various Boards or Regional Committees ' . Barnes had given a polite but utterly non-committal answer.70 The demand for workers ' control ' was voiced in articles in the NUR journal , Railway Review , on 11 January , 24 Mary , 9 August and 8 November 1946 ; again on 14 March and 6 June 1947 . Finally , on 8 August 1947 , after the appointments to the Railway Executive had been announced , a disgusted article by F. V. Pickstock ( the author of the previous pieces ) appeared , entitled Government by " Experts " ? End of any ideas of effective Workers ' Control ? ' The Railway Clerks ' Association 's Executive Committee minuted on 21 September 1947 that it regards with dismay and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Minister of Transport ... the Executive views the appointment of only one member from the Trade Unions concerned as a failure to recognise the assistance which can be given by the workers to create greater efficiency and goodwill on the railways ... the staff can not be expected to have confidence in the Railway Executive as now constituted . ' Not may individuals offered themselves for appointment , though a notable exception had been Sir Philip Warier , " who was later to become Deputy Chairman of the BTC . He let it be known that he would be interested in an Executive appointment in August 1947 , at that time without success . Too late in the day , in October 1947 , the SI(M) Committee considered a note by Morrison on The Manning of Public Boards ' . Barnes was briefed by S. S. Wilson for this meeting , with an analysis of the backgrounds of his own appointees , summed up by the conclusion that they were , overall , hard-working , experienced , elderly and safe ' . ' Z It is impossible to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been properly explored . None of the Member vacancies had been publicly advertised ? the only case in which a public advertisement had been involved was for an officer post , and it had thrown up an outstandingly successful applicant , General Russell . The alternatives to advertisement were either a secret comprehensive register ( which did not then exist ) , or a grape-vine ' of personal contacts . The latter was obviously adopted , but it suffered from two disadvantages . The first was the relatively low level of salaries insisted upon by the Chancellor of the Exchequer ; the second was the limited contacts with the business world possessed by Labour ministers and even such senior civil servants as Hurcomb . In consequence , the Commission ? and also to some extent the Executives ? comprised teams of second elevens ' . 6 The Commission at Work The total life-span of the BTC was to be only fifteen years ; and even this relatively short period was to be divided into two phases ? from 1948 to 1953 , and from 1953 to 1962 , with progress towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been created virtually confined to the first phase . Even within that short span , no more than four years could be devoted to the original grand design ' of integrated transport , since the Conservative government which took office in October 1951 quickly made known its intention drastically to revise the provisions of the Transport Act , 1947 ; it thus imposed a virtual standstill upon all those activities of the BTC of which the Conservatives did not approve . One writer has commented that the task before them required at least twenty years of hard , steady and purposeful effort ' ) The Commission certainly started in a confident mood , shown by the early Annual Reports ? massive volumes which run to more than 400 pages . True to his civil service training , Hurcomb insisted that it must be demonstrated that , Section by Section , the Transport Act 's requirements were being met . Administrative arrangements of a tidying-up character were very numerous ; in the 1948 Report they require twenty pages ( over 6000 words of text ) followed by no more than a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal raison d'etre , and the main duty laid upon it by the Act , namely integration . These two paragraphs , which bear the signs of Hurcomb 's own drafting , are confined to cautious generalisations . They start with a platitude ? that to integrate is to combine parts in a single whole ' ? and continue by arguing that the Commission 's task can only be brought to full fruition when the acquisition of long-distance road haulage has been completed and schemes approved for road passenger transport and ports and harbours . Integration must therefore be a gradual process . ' Z It was already clear that the smoothness or otherwise with which the huge BTC undertaking could function was to be determined largely by the relationships of the Commission with the Minister of Transport and the government as a whole , and of the Commission with the Executives . So far as relations with the Ministry were concerned , Hurcomb 's long period as its Permanent Secretary , and his final two years working with Barnes gave the BTC an initial 60 // advantage which lasted until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ministry , a working party was set up under Birtchnell 's chairmanship to consider the future relations between the Minister and the BTC . The report of the working party dealt mainly with the Minister 's powers to give directions ( S.4(1) of the Act ) and to require information ( S.4(6) ) . It agreed that there will be a number of problems important enough for direction which will be more satisfactorily solved by discussion and agreement ... without the issue of a direction . . . Departure from a direction might be the subject of a Question in Parliament designed to show either that the direction was wrong or the Commission disobedient ' . ' In other words , the Minister should be enabled to enforce his wishes without accepting public responsibility for the consequences . On the power to demand information , the working party agreed that two views were possible : one , that this power should be exercised as little as possible ; the other , that the Minister would frequently wish to have information on various matters of which . . . he ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties of rail transport , the trend of transit and turn round times , the quality of the service provided or the progress made in co-ordinating the different types of transport ' . Significantly , the report continued : A request for information would not necessarily mean that the Minister accepted responsibility for the position it disclosed . ' The working party concluded that the latter view was the one which the Department should pursue , and would indeed be forced upon it by events . ' S. S. Wilson , however , prepared a lengthy and strongly worded note of dissent . He argued that the whole philosophy of the Transport Act had been to place responsibility firmly upon the BTC and that the Minister ( meaning , in effect , senior civil servants ) should resist the temptation to meddle , even by way of demanding information which it might be interesting to have , but which could not be said to be essential . He quoted tellingly from Herbert Morrison 's writings the following passage : The Minister will have no right to interfere with the working of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the right to send for the Board or its Chairman and say : " Here is something you are doing wrong ; you must alter your ways and pursue the following policy ... " A mischievous and not too competent Minister could easily ruin any business undertaking if that were permitted , whilst a weak and inefficient management would protect itself against public criticism by spreading the story " there is too much Minister in the running of this show " . ' ' // Wilson went further and floated the interesting idea that the creation of the BTC had made the Ministry 's title something of a misnomer . The BTC , he argued , was unlike the socialised industries providing a single type of commodity or service ; it had to establish a policy for transport as a whole and co-ordinate the various forms in ways that previously might have been regarded as a function of the Ministry . It follows , therefore , that the responsibility of the Minister of Transport is at a stage more remote than that of his colleagues ' .6 The idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the Ministry of Transport redundant , except in regard to highways , had also occurred to some of the BTC staff . For instance , it was suggested that the placing of a statutory responsibility for safety upon the BTC had made unnecessary the Ministry Railway Inspectorate 's continued existence . ' S. S. Wilson 's objections were placed on the file together with the working party 's report , which as a guide-line to practice had little effect in view of the strong and direct line of communication between Hurcomb and Barnes . However , the working party had slipped in a sentence of interest : We would like to stress the importance of cordial informal contacts between Administrative Officers in the Department and their opposite numbers in the Commission . ' In fact personal contacts leading to friendships and better mutual understanding did develop between individual officers of the BTC and of the Ministry , in ways that were often at least as helpful to the former as to the latter , for example in obtaining Ministry support with other departments over such matters as capital investment restraint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timber . But the report of the working party illustrated a general belief among civil servants that they were in a position to exercise some form of paternal supervision over the newly nationalised industries . The SI(M) Committee was for a considerable time interested in some form of efficiency audit ' , but eventually accepted that this was best left to the sponsoring ministries . Sir Reginald Hill , shortly after Hurcomb had left the Ministry for the BTC , and whilst still himself Deputy Secretary , wrote to Hurcomb on 18 September 1947 enclosing twenty copies of Notes to be brought to the attention of the BTC ' . There were eighteen such points . Some were ? especially having regard to Hurcomb 's long involvement with the Transport Act and the motives behind it ? superfluous , to say the least : for instance , The BTC must be essentially a body to make policy decisions . It must at all times take a broad survey and make a universal approach to the // problems of policy in transport and not a sectional approach . ' At the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing rights in the Caledonian and Crinan Canals were not to be disturbed ! Warnings were also sounded against driving private operators out of business by manipulation of charges , and creating excessively large clerical and administrative staffs . These admonitions were supplemented by a list of assurances given by Government spokesmen in relation to points arising on the Transport Bill . Sir Gilmour Jenkins , who had succeeded Hurcomb as Permanent Secretary of the Ministry , wrote semi-apologetically to Hurcomb on 21 October saying No-one is better aware than you of the circumstances and intentions underlying the Notes ... Mr Barnes wishes it to be clearly understood that nothing in the Notes should be construed in any way as a General Direction . ' Hurcomb politely acknowledged . An example of the sort of detailed control that some civil servants expected to exercise arose in a letter dated 1 December 1947 from Alec Johnson , a Principal Assistant Secretary in the Ministry of Reconstruction , to a Treasury colleague claiming that the BTC 's use of Region ' as a railway term was contrary to a ruling of the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for areas coterminous with the regions ' of Government departments , and continuing I do not see how we can allow this one to pass . ' The letter was copied to the Ministry of Transport , where S. S. Wilson ( whose firm grasp of practicalities exceeded that of most of his more bureaucratically minded colleagues ) wrote caustically My view is that this is nothing more than pea shooting , and the Commission can , if they like , call a cat a dog if other people know what they mean ' .8 However , the point was raised with Hurcomb , who ( characteristically ) replied that matters had gone too far for a change in nomenclature to be made at this late stage . In general , Hurcomb 's former subordinates in the Ministry of Transport handled him carefully , in view of his excellent relationship with their minister . Hurcomb himself kept a close watch on the contacts between civil servants and his present officers , especially on matters affecting the Executives , such as overall investment restrictions ; he would cross-question his staff on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commission 's interests were not being subordinated to the views of his own former officials . He also insisted upon all communications with the Ministry being channelled throught the BTC , and , except on very minor matters , through // himself ? despite several attempts by civil servants to obtain information from Executives direct . The civil servants were backed by Barnes , who argued that this would not undermine the position of the Commission if it were confined to fact-finding . But Hurcomb resisted , and Barnes did not insist . Particular concern was caused to Hurcomb by decisions of the Investments Programmes Committee , a Cabinet committee of officials responsible for drawing up the annual allocations of capital investment in physical terms ( use of labour and scarce materials ) . The Commission ineffectively complained in Annual Reports , and also directly to the Ministry , that the needs of transport were being subordinated to those of export industries and fuel and power , especially coal and electricity , in the era of post-war austerity ' . Hurcomb felt that the Ministry of Transport did not support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to justify : but he always bowed to decisions by ministers . One factor simplifying the relationship with the Ministry was the absence of any serious financial problems that might alarm the Treasury , as interest upon the government stocks issued in exchange for the Commission 's assets was never in danger in this period , even though the overall financial results were unsatisfactory , with an accumulated deficit , financed from internal sources , of ? 27.3 million by the end of the first six years . If relations with the Ministry presented no major problem , this was not true of the internal relations between the BTC and the Executives . Whilst the Act had prescribed a duty to integrate ' transport , it had simultaneously made this difficult by providing that each form of transport should have separate managements . There had been no precedent for the curious organisation created by the 1947 Act ; the concept of a small group of men framing policy and planning for the future , but without direct managerial responsibilities , was not easy to translate into concrete terms . Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in permanent session , or be simply a talking-shop ; men of real calibre would desire the satisfaction of decision-making . Hurcomb , although he demanded twiceweekly meetings of the Commission , accepted that in addition the members must have some individual fields of responsibility , even though nothing like the functional organisation of the Railway Executive was in mind . Sir William Wood had been made Chairman of a Charges Committee , composed of members of the Railway , Road Transport , London Transport and Docks and Inland Waterways // Executives ; but the requirement in the Act ( Section 76 ) to submit a draft Charges Scheme to the Transport Tribunal within two years from the passing of the Act , i.e. by August 1949 , was found to be unrealistic in view of the volume of work envisaged , and an extension of time had to be requested by the middle of 1949 . Benstead was fully occupied by questions of labour relations , which brought him into close contact with all the Executives ; he also supervised higher management appointments . Lord Ashfield 's early death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , something which did not escape Morrison 's attention : he more than once prodded Barnes on the subject . Eventually Barnes decided , on Hurcomb 's suggestion , to bring in a railwaymen , F. A. Pope , ' who was appointed a full-time Member in July 1950 . In the same year Barnes appointed Lt Col S. J. L. Hardie10 as a part-time Member , but Colonel Hardie resigned after six months on being appointed Chairman of the new nationalised Iron and Steel Corporation . John Ryan of the Metal Box Company was then appointed in replacement . " In the following year , 1951 , another industrialist , H. P. Barker , 12 was appointed a parttime Member . This steady increase in the part-time element in the Commission was remarkable in view of the many arguments that had been adduced in favour during the passage of the Bill but which , at that time , were strongly resisted by Barnes , who had been committed to the concept of the small , full-time planning team . Whilst Wood and Benstead had fairly clearly defined spheres of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Hurcomb to a variety of odd jobs , which scarcely matched his considerable abilities . To him , as to some others , the Commission meetings were unsatisfactory mainly because Hurcomb dominated the discussions yet at the same time often shied away from clear-cut decisions . Lord Rusholme , business-like and sparing of words , often listened with suppressed irritation to the Chairman 's harangues . But Benstead , with a career still before him , and needing on financial grounds as well as ambition to obtain re-appointment after his initial term had expired , supported Hurcomb loyally . He shouldered any tasks assigned to him in ways that eventually produced some reward , since in January 1949 Hurcomb arranged for him to become Deputy Chairman , an inexpensive promotion that did not require ministerial approval nor bring any increase in salary . Unrest among Commission Members was partly due to Hurcomb 's style of chairmanship . Although he had been an outstanding civil servant , his effectiveness now seemed diminished by just those in66 The Nationalisation of British Transport grained civil service habits of caution , by the avoidance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism , even if quite unjustified . Hurcomb 's dislike of issuing direct instructions was certainly not appreciated by Pope , who commented , soon after his appointment , We have got to get some discipline into this outfit ' .13 Pope had been considered a successful Chairman of the Ulster Transport Authority and hence an exponent of road and rail ' integration ' in practice . But he soon began to share some of the irritation felt by the other Commission Members in dealing with the Railway Executive , where , if the Members experienced some frustration , even more was experienced by the staff , headed by the Chief Secretary . Beevor and his chief assistants ( soon re-designated Principal Officers in an attempt to improve their status vis-a-vis their counterparts in the Executives ) had come from the railway world and were accustomed to an organisation in which policy was mainly evolved within a management team headed by a chief executive or general manager , who submitted his proposals for approval to his Board . Things were very different within the BTC . It received reports and proposals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , usually , a covering memorandum by Beevor ( or Wilson , in the case of financial proposals ) . But Beevor 's views did not now carry the weight that they had done when he had addressed the board of the London and North Eastern Railway . Hurcomb formed his own views independently , though his civil service training prevented him from taking similar action to Pope , who once ripped Beevor 's covering memorandum from a Railway Executive document placed on the agenda , remarking that he was quite capable of forming his own view without the advice of the Chief Secretary . By 1951 Beevor 's outlook was depressed and frustrated . He had endeavoured to improve co-operation between the Commission and its Executives , which he regarded as the sine qua non for effective integration of the transport industry , and had been responsible for the creation of a Common Legal Service which , though meeting with some opposition at first , in fact had come to function with efficiency . He had thereafter discarded the title of Legal Adviser to the Commission and sought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a former railway Chief General Manager ( even if only an acting one ) , he was a natural candidate for the succession to the Chairmanship of the Railway Executive when Missenden retired in February 1951 . This did not come his way ; there are no Ministry papers on the // subject , but it appeared that Hurcomb finally decided to recommend Pope for the position . This must have been a case of the attraction of opposites ; Pope , convivial , a strong delegator of work to his subordinates and no master of the written word , was as unlike Hurcomb as it was possible to be . Barnes however , rather surprisingly , ignored Hurcomb in this instance and instead ( contrary to the formal provisions of the Transport Act ) consulted Missenden , who strongly and successfully recommended the appointment of his former Southern Railway colleague , John Elliot , now Chief Regional Officer of the London Midland Region.14 Hurcomb did not take this very well and , at his first meeting with Elliot after the latter 's appointment ( in Hurcomb 's wretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) 15 made it clear to Elliot that he had not been the BTC Chairman 's choice . By this time Beevor had lost any ambition to continue coping with the mass of clerical and paper work with which he was faced , without the authority of the chief executive position . He had received no proper recognition of his considerable efforts , unlike the Comptroller who had been honoured with a well-deserved knighthood in the New Year Honours of 1951 . He was therefore attracted by a remunerative offer which he received from the engineering industry and this he accepted . It enabled him to resume his former association with Sir Ronald Matthews , the ex-Chairman of the LNER , and he resigned from the Commission 's service in June 1951 . He was succeeded by S. B. Taylor , who perhaps came closer to Hurcomb 's conception of what the Commission ( or he himself ) wanted , a purely secretarial officer who , unlike Beevor , would not formulate or express views on policy . Apart from the upset over the appointment of Elliot , Hurcomb 's relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a peerage , which was conferred in the Birthday Honours of 1950 . ( Benstead , incidentally , was to be knighted in 1952 , under the Conservative administration , but on Hurcomb 's nomination . ) Hurcomb was skilful at forestalling criticisms , whether from ministers or MPs , and at ensuring that any future scrutiny of his actions would find them blameless . As a consequence his staff became accustomed to receiving notes from the Chairman beginning We shall be criticised if . . . ' Those who had come from businesses which were hardened to the experience of criticism in the course of their work sometimes found this ingrained civil service attitude on Hurcomb 's part ? based on long experience of Parliamentary Questions and Public Accounts Committees ? hard to understand . // The BTC Annual Reports were written throughout in a way designed to demonstrate the rectitude with which the Commission was carrying out its statutory duties . Their language ? revised and in many significant paragraphs actually written by Hurcomb ? is that of a government White Paper . In addition , R. H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force in clarity , especially in the presentation of the supporting data and statistics . Their form was officially approved by the Minister in a Direction dated 27 July 1949 , which conformed to the requirements of Section 94 of the Transport Act ; but it had in fact all been the work of the Comptroller and his able supporting team , largely drawn from outside the transport industry . Historians and transport economists alike were now presented with a great mass of information in a readily understandable form , a masterpiece of presentation . The Accounts were supplemented by notes which went far beyond mere explanation of the figures , and which discussed the whole philosophy of nationalised transport financing and the justification for the concept of one undertaking ' , for instance the decision not to allocate central charges and interest between the Executives . If , at the political and administrative level , the Commission was able to repel attacks with argument and figures , it was more vulnerable to Press and public criticism . Hurcomb was by temperament shy and disinclined to make public appearances . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great business in the public eye demanded more than the protection which conscious rectitude could afford . As early as November 1947 he arranged , on the strong recommendation of Lord Ashfield , for the Commission to appoint a Chief Public Relations and Publicity Officer in the person of J. H. Brebner , 16 then holding a similar position with the London Passenger Transport Board . Brebner , like Wilson , reported direct to the Commission ( in practice , to the Chairman ) and not through the Chief Secretary , which once more emphasized that the latter was not the BTC 's chief executive . Brebner was a forceful personality with many friends in the Press , to whom he was always known as Jock . He was far from being a typical civil servant , despite having spent many years with the Post Office . He groomed Hurcomb very effectively for the speeches and public appearances that the chairman of a great public corporation in the public eye must expect to make . Originally these were not very congenial to Hurcomb 's rather reserved and austere nature ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // appearances and eventually even seemed to relish them . Brebner was assisted by a Public Relations Officer , J. L. Henderson , who specialised in contacts with Members of Parliament and also with the Ministry over Parliamentary Questions concerning the BTC . Henderson 's personality and contacts were a valuable counterpart to Hurcomb 's knowledge of the political world as seen through the eyes of an experienced ( and sometimes cynical ) civil servant . Brebner tended to concentrate upon Press relations ; his personality fitted the world of Fleet Street better than that of Whitehall or Westminster , where Henderson 's smoother approach was usually more successful . Accordingly , the Commission was apparently well entrenched in relations with the corridors of power ' , though Press relations continued to be difficult owing to hostility on the part of most newspaper proprietors to nationalisation . It was to be some years before the Commission was to produce more popular publicity to supplement or replace the rather drab volumes that HM Stationery Office published in a standard format for all the major nationalised industries . But , given this secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as the Labour Government remained in office ? the internal situation was very uneasy . Relations between the BTC and the Executives were , as many had foreseen , complicated by the fact that the BTC had no hire and fire ' power over its nominally subordinate organs , owing to Barnes 's insistence that he , and not the Commission , would appoint the members of the Executives . In the case of the Railway Executive , the psychological effect of this was serious and it damaged the BTC 's ability to secure the execution of its policies . After his retirement , Hurcomb unhesitatingly stated that the main weakness of the 1947 Act was that the Commission did not appoint the Members of its Executives ' . " It would be wrong to generalise too completely on this point , because the BTC/Executive relationships were not uniform . There was a difference between the attitudes of , on the one hand , the Railway and London Transport Executives , and , on the other , of the remaining Executives . The first two had inherited existing undertakings with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build up their organisations more or less from scratch . The personalities of Missenden and Lord Latham , and their support from departmental officers imbued with long-standing traditions of management , gave them a self-assurance in dealing with , and on occasion resisting , the Commission that the other Executive Chairmen scarcely possessed . Personal circumstances also played a part : // General Russell , although appointed by the Minister , was well aware that he had been Hurcomb 's nominee and owed him a debt in consequence . Sir Reginald Hill had been Hurcomb 's second-incommand in the Ministry ; and Lord Inman found no reason to quarrel with the relationship of his small Executive to the BTC . The real problem came over the BTC/RE relationship . The Executive considered the powers reserved to the British Transport Commission as merely certain exceptions to the overall Scheme of Delegation , which in fact had transferred the managerial tasks of the railways to the Executive ... The British Transport Commission , on the other hand , and in particular the Chairman ... regarded the Railway Executive and the Commission as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not consider that the specific reservation to the Commission of certain formal powers constituted the limit of their scope in the formulation of policy ' . ' ' Unhappily , therefore , instead of a partnership of minds , the Executive felt it necessary to establish defences against encroachment by the Commission upon what they regarded as their reserved sphere of management ; equally , the Commission were impatient of any attempt by the Executives to limit their field of enquiry , advice and guidance ' .19 The London Transport Executive also , inheriting a tradition of centralised , authoritarian management was not disposed to take the Commission into any real partnership . During the first months of the Commission 's existence , the presence of Lord Ashfield virtually ensured that any London Transport proposal requiring formal BTC consent would receive it automatically . In fact , Ashfield on occasion would summon BTC officers to his room and instruct them in the way in which an LTE case should be put to his fellow-Members of the Commission . After his death in November 1948 the BTC felt more able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and then the barriers were erected . The Executive argued but very seldom gave ground , and never really changed their policy recommendations . It was probably naive of the Commission to believe that it could monitor , and if necessary intervene in , the activities of the Executives by instructing them to submit their minutes to the BTC for information if not for approval . The defensive measure taken by the RE was to prepare two sets of minutes , the official ones ( on white paper ) containing material thought suitable for the Commission 's eyes , and a // second set ( on green paper , and entitled Memoranda of Decisions at Meeting ' ) containing matter which it was desired to withhold . London Transport protected itself by following a procedure inherited from the LPTB under Ashfield 's Chairmanship . The Executive 's formal meetings , attended by both full-time and part-time members , dealt mainly with non-contentious and routine matters ; the BTC found the minutes singularly uninformative . Policy questions were however discussed and minuted at meetings known as the Executive Conference , attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course reach the BTC.20 The Act itself contributed to the difficulty of establishing flexible relationships by its provision for legally binding Schemes of Delegation from the BTC to the Executives , followed by Directions . It was natural that the Executives should interpret these legalistically and resent any attempt by the Commission to extend its authority beyond what appeared to be provided for in the Act . The Commission was probably at fault in scanning the minutes of the Executives and sometimes thereafter writing for further information , or expressing disquiet at some action which the Executives considered to lie within their own authority . But the BTC was anxious that the formal , arm'slength relationship suggested by this procedure should be supplemented by closer , less formal contacts . It instituted regular meetings with each Executive , at which the agenda could include any subjects which either side felt could profitably be discussed . The Railway Executive attended these meetings unwillingly and some of its individual Members expressed the view that they were a waste of time.21 A major change in the organisation , and one which required the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Road Transport Executive the task of preparing schemes for road passenger transport , partly to enable it to concentrate upon its major tasks in the freight field , partly to accelerate progress with area schemes , which had been hanging , the other members being W. Vane Morland , James Amos , William Beckett and Stanley Kennedy . Cardwell , Vane Morland and Beckett were salaried , but Amos and Kennedy were unpaid in view of their salaried Chairmanships of the Bus Groups owned by the Commission and which , at any rate for the time being , remained outside the control of the Executive as such . One of the earliest organisational changes which the Commission // considered desirable was the establishment of common services ' for all the Executives , replacing the specialist departments in most of the Executives for such functions as law , estate and rating , police , scientific research and commercial advertising . At meetings with the Commission , the Executives expressed hostility to this policy ; that was expressed most emphatically by the RE who , when it was clear that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote that if the Commission are determined to proceed with the scheme , the Railway Executive would ask that a formal Direction should be issued to them , as they are unwilling to let it appear that the scheme has been accepted voluntarily ' .22 Although the Commission enforced its wishes in the legal function , and also later in the field of commercial advertising , it was obliged to compromise or defer its proposals in other fields . In research , although appointing its own Chief Research Officer , it failed to give him effective control of the research facilities in the Railway and London Transport Executives , which these bodies managed to keep under their own control by advancing arguments which the BTC found it difficult to refute . As a result , the Chief Research Officer was relatively ineffective . The London Transport Executive also strongly objected to its police being absorbed into a new British Transport Police force , arguing , plausibly , that its police officers ( unlike those of the main line railways ) were very largely involved with the traffic department in the detection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority would weaken their efficacy in this task . The Commission accepted this argument to the extent that the London Transport Police remained a separate unit although associated with the British Transport Police . By contrast , relations with the Road Transport ( later Road Haulage ) Executive were relatively good , reinforced by the fact that the Comptroller of the Commission was , through his Director of Acqusitions , rapidly purchasing the assets to be managed by the Executive . The Docks and Inland Waterways Executive , also in the process of setting up a new organisation for the ex-railway docks , was anxious to enlist the Commission 's support . Unlike the RE and LTE , who came reluctantly to the joint meetings , the DIWE Chairman wrote to Hurcomb on 1 January 1948 suggesting meetings once a fortnight . Beevor pointed out to Hurcomb the practical difficulties in this proposal and Hurcomb agreed that much less frequent meetings would be appropriate.23 But Hill ? probably because of his previous // relationship with Hurcomb ? tended to raise many questions with the Commission , rather than decide them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not needed frequently . The Commission expressed some doubts about the Executive 's draft organisation which Beevor described in a memorandum to Hurcomb as the half-formed ideas now presented ' 24 but these were eventually resolved to the Commission 's satisfaction . Contacts thereafter mainly related to the authorisation of expenditure upon hotel improvements and programmes for building restaurant and buffet cars submitted jointly with the Railway Executive , rather than catering policy , with the details of which the Commission did not concern itself . The relationships between the Commission and its Executives were , therefore , by no means uniform . Personalities undoubtedly played a large part . Missenden not merely heartily disliked the whole thing ' , 25 but extended these feelings towards Hurcomb . Where there was such mutual suspicion , communication became difficult . On the other hand , despite the clumsy nature of the statutory organisation and the overlapping of responsibilities , outside the Railway Executive the clash of interests and the power struggle were less significant . The relationships are described in more detail in the chapters which follow and outline the progress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Creation of British Road Services In the early years of the BTC , the creation of a nationalised road haulage business , offering a country-wide service and dominating the road haulage industry , stands out as a remarkable achievement . For many years transport historians and economists had quoted the road haulage business as one in which the optimum size of undertakings tended to be small ? where the disadvantages of size often tended to outweigh the advantages ) The successful establishment of British Road Services , by the end of 1951 comprising 3766 former haulage firms and 41 265 motor lorries , proved that such views were not necessarily correct . It may be mentioned here that British Road Services ' was adopted at an early stage as the trading name for the future business , owing to the lack of appeal and even intelligibility of The Road Transport Executive ' , soon to become The Road Haulage Executive ' . The general public and the trading community had no idea of the constitution of Executives as compared with companies or firms , still less of their relationship with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adopted British Railways ' for business purposes . As mentioned previously , the Chairman of the Road Haulage Executive had a military background which influenced his style of management . He was by no means a desk-bound administrator and insisted upon frequent personal tours of inspection . But ( a typical touch ) his use of the number-plate BRS 1 ' on his personal car was viewed by his staff with mixed feelings . On the one hand , it certainly showed the flag ; on the other , it markedly assisted the unofficial grapevine through which depots could be warned by telephone of an impending descent by the Chairman ! Eventually the point was taken by Russell , and the plate was changed . His headquarters organisation also had traces of Army practice . It was based on line and staff ' principles , and thereby differed from the functional , centralised organisation of the railways . Each Executive Member had , in addition to his collective responsibility for policy , individual responsibilities for oversight of one or more departmental function , as follows : 74 // Below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a department , who also met as a Committee under the chairmanship of the Secretary and Legal Adviser , G. W. Quick Smith , ' who has written flexibility and common-sense were the keynotes ? what was regarded as the inflexibility of the railways was an ever-present warning of the dangers that faced large organisations ' . ' Below headquarters level , the outline of a future national road haulage organisation was soon developed , with eight Divisions , each sub-divided into Districts , thirty in all . Each District was divided into Groups , numbering about 200 in total , and each Group into depots , of which there were eventually to be around 1000 . Vehicle strength of Divisions ulimately , ranged between 2000 and 5000 vehicles ; of Districts 1000 and 2000 ; of Groups 100 to 300 and depots from 5 vehicles upwards to more than 200 . This standard pattern applied to general haulage work , but the Executive acquired a number of firms engaged in conveyance of special traffic ; including bulk liquids ; explosives and inflammable goods ; household removals ; meat ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquisition ( Section 39(2) of the Act ) . ( Pickfords was an outstanding example . ) They did not fit into the regional management pattern and were grouped in a single Special Traffics Division , operating under titles based on BRS ( Pickfords ) ' . There were several stages before the BRS organisation could assume its final shape . First of all , the former railway-owned haulage firms , forty-five in number , were absorbed as primary undertakings ' and joined by 418 firms which were approached for voluntary acquisition , both to obtain the services of key managers in the // industry and to build up the nuclei formed by the vested ' businesses . Between February 1948 and June 1949 this process led to over 12 000 vehicles being brought in voluntarily . The company structure was retained until August 1949 , whereafter Boards of Directors were progressively replaced by the BRS standard management structure . Subsequently , many secondary undertakings ' were acquired , either by agreement or ? after 1 October 1948 ? by the use of compulsory purchase powers . The remainder were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving of Notices under the Act . In 1948 a good start was made , with 248 predominantly longdistance undertakings owning 8208 motor vehicles , 1717 trailers and 1867 horse vehicles coming under the control of the Executive , either inherited from the main line railways or voluntarily acquired ; between October 1948 and the end of the year 113 notices of compulsory acquisition had also been served . At one stage , firms were being acquired at the rate of ten per working day . One secret of success in this huge operation lay in a separation of the tasks of acquiring the businesses from the tasks of setting up the new organisation and supervising its working . From the start , responsibility for acquisitions was accepted by the Commission itself , the work being carried out under the supervision of a Director of Acquisitions , Andrew Black , 4 who reported to the BTC 's Comptroller , R. H. Wilson . The practical details were worked out and implemented , however , under the aegis of an Acquisitions Co-ordinating Committee at Executive headquarters . All the headquarters Departmental Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surveying , Secretarial , and Finance ? were members of the Committee . Andrew Black was ably represented by John Lunch , one of his team of up-andcoming young Accountants . The Committee met weekly throughout the whole Acquisitions period , every prospective acquisition being subjected to close and often critical survey ; and its recommendations were generally rubber-stamped by the Executive immediately and without quibble ' .5 The initial stages , when large businesses were being bought to form the primary organisation , went comparatively smoothly . The preservation of trading names long known to the public ? Carter Paterson , Pickfords , Houldsworth &; Hanson , Faircloughs and Dutfield ? was a question that exercised the Executive , in view of the goodwill arising from the use of such names . In the end , only the Pickfords title was retained for trading purposes , but steps were taken to avert the risk of // other well-known names being adopted by competitors of BRS . Quick Smith has written : the absorption of these sizeable and usually wellmanaged undertakings was comparatively easy as compared with compulsory acquisitions . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing buyer and a willing seller ... Even so , the exercise was no easy one if only because of the number involved ... completion days came thick and fast ' .6 One particular episode may be mentioned , the acquisition of a block of 53 companies in a single financial group , the Transport Association Ltd . The Executive was told , without forewarning , on a Thursday that completion would take place the following Monday . By Monday evening 53 board meetings had been held , resignations had been received from existing directors and a new standard board of five Executive nominees took the place of the former boards and transacted all the formal and necessary business connected with the handover . As smaller undertakings were purchased , on the take-over day each firm was for a time kept as an independent unit ( with a separate trading account ) but was placed under the wing of one of the voluntarily-acquired " key " undertakings . As time went on these key undertakings with secondaries attached were formed into entities called Groups with one trading account for each Group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to the Group in whose territory they were situated ... in August 1949 the company structure was finally abandoned according to plan and the Division-District-Group structure took its place . ' The majority of acquisitions took place under the compulsion powers in the Transport Act . Under regulations made by the Minister , the Executive served a Notice of Acquisition on the owner of a haulage business deemed to be predominantly long-distance ' in character , and the Notice had to specify a date , not less than ten weeks ahead , upon which ownership must be transferred . On that date the property would vest in the Commission and all relevant contracts were also transferred to the BTC , subject to certain rights of disclaimer ( Section 46(2) ) of the Act ) . The haulier could contest the Notice of Acquisition on the ground that his business was wrongly designated predominantly long-distance ' and in such cases the dispute was carried to the Transport Arbitration Tribunal created for this purpose under Section 105 of the Act . The Tribunal also settled disputes over the amount of compensation payable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the goods vehicles of the firm , other property , goodwill and severance . The price of vehicles was laid // down on a flexible formula ; ' that of property at open market ' value . Goodwill was assessed at between two and five years ' purchase of average net profits , the actual number of years depending upon the likelihood of profits being maintained . The achievement of this rate of growth was by any standards remarkable , as Table 7.1 below demonstrates : Towards the end of the acquisitioning procedure , when a rump ' of small businesses of often rather doubtful value had , under the Act , to be acquired , a short-cut known unofficially as the bag of gold ' was adopted . Firms were visited by representatives carrying cheque-books and empowered to make an immediate settlement , following a quick inspection of the vehicles , premises and books of the business . Few small hauliers failed to be seduced by instant cash ! The rapid pace of acquisitions was justified on the grounds that it was preferable for a major surgical operation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of the industry affected should be left for an unduly long period in a state of confused suspension between public and private ownership ' .9 Meanwhile the procedure for controlling non-BTC haulage through permits issued by the Execu-tive was being worked out . The Act ( Section 52 ) provided that after an Appointed Day ' , carriage of goods ( apart from some special traffics ) more than twenty-five miles from a firm 's operating centre might only be carried on with a vehicle permit , though Section 53 had provided that such permits should be issued automatically to existing pre-nationalisation operators , refusal of a permit entitling the opera-tor to demand that his business be acquired . During 1949 some 17 000 applications for Original Permits ? based on grandfather rights ' ? were received by the RHE . This , and the difficulty of examining each // case , forced the Commission to ask the Minister that the Appointed Day ' be extended to 1 February 1950 . Accordingly , the establishment of the water-tight monopoly of long-distance road haulage was postponed . Soon after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Original Permits ' , of which some 5200 were revoked in September 1950 , leading to demands for acquisition by the BTC . The permit procedure , heavily criticised in the industry and by the trade journals , was loftily justified in the Commission 's Annual Report for 1951 in words that seem strange in view of the fact that the Report was written after the change of government in October 1951 . It is often asserted that it is wrong and unfair that the Commission or the Executive should be the authority for deciding between themselves and their competitors whether or not a Permit should be granted . This ignores the principle of the Act . The basis of the Act was that the Commission should have monopoly of long-distance public haulage . It is for that that compensation was paid and on that basis the extent of any temporary or partial infringements of their monopoly to be allowed was therefore to be determined by the Commission ' .10 The Commission 's words might be considered defiant , addressed to a Conservative Minister committed to de-nationalisation . By the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stock had been paid out , though many cases still awaited final settlement . It must be asked whether the pressure to carry acquisitions through as a short and sharp surgical operation ' had led to compensation being paid on a more generous scale than necessary . " There can be little doubt that had the process been a voluntary one on both sides , the RHE would not have wanted to take over a number of businesses which the Act required it to purchase . A slower build-up , of selected companies of high standing would have been comparable with the methods used by the small number of successful private financial groups within the haulage industry . But from the beginning , the Commission was pressing for rapid completion of the task . There was however one aspect of the enforced cessation of acquisition after the change of Government in October 1951 that was not unfavourable to the RHE . In the main programme BRS had been forced to acquire a whole lot of businesses with vehicles and property they did n't want . But had the final stages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government , several thousand operators ? those left to the last because they were least wanted ? might , upon revocation of their permits , have exercised their option to be acquired . The Executive was at least spared the last bitter dregs ! " 2
