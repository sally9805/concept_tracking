Many have disagreed . Insiders , in fact , are predicting a rarefied place for this exceptionally talented young man . And in a country renowned for its restraint , such predictions should not be taken lightly . Indeed , after Mr. Branagh ' s recent performance in the title role of ' ' Henry V ' ' with Britain ' s most famous drama troupe , the Royal Shakespeare Company ( RSC ) , one long-established London critic went on record as saying he had never been so moved by a portrayal of the warring king - not even Lawrence Olivier ' s. // // Branagh ( pronounced ' ' branna ' ' ) is clearly no flash in BRANAGHBRANAGH // the pan . Despite being in the business only four years , he has behind him a series of rapid-fire successes unparalleled by any British actor of his generation . His rise began upon leaving Britain ' s top drama school ( the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts ) in 1981 , taking with him the coveted Bancroft Gold Medal ; his portrayal of ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in memory . Shortly thereafter , he landed the lead in the West End smash hit ' ' Another Country , ' ' was promptly proclaimed British theater ' s Most Promising Newcomer of 1982 , and he went on to star in a much-lauded drama trilogy for the British Broadcasting Corporation. // Plummier TV parts followed , but Branagh was itching to return to the stage . So , at the tender age of 22 , he precociously produced and financed his own one-man show : a premiere dramatic rendering of Tennyson ' s poem ' ' Maud . ' ' Despite what Branagh calls ' ' the cloud of Victorian gloom ' ' that hangs over the poem , he was fired up by the idea of attempting ' ' to release something which , like Shakespeare , seemed to be book-bound and dull . ' ' It would also be , if it could be pulled off , a great splashy piece for an actor . He adds wryly : ' ' It ' s a tour de force just remembering 1 , 400 lines of verse - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to be made through the venture , mounted in a small theater on the fringes of London . It also meant turning down the RSC , which had just offered him a bit-part contract - something most actors his age would have grabbed . Had Branagh accepted , however , he wouldn ' t have been able to gamble with ' ' Maud ' ' - and his philosophy is that an actor can not be great in a poor part , but he has at least the potential for greatness in a great part. // ' ' I don ' t mean that in an arrogant way , ' ' he explains . ' ' But if you ' re the vessel of something wonderful , then it expands you . So you ' ve got to do what you can to put yourself in the way of those opportunities. ' ' // His philosophy paid off . His one-man show elicited the kind of raves most young actors only dream about . It also persuaded RSC directors to put forward an unprecedented offer : the title role in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance to become the youngest actor in the history of the company ever to play the part. // Branagh , son of a carpenter and raised in working-class Belfast until the age of 9 ( when his family moved to England ) , possesses the kind of commanding presence on stage that eludes most actors , whatever their age. // ' ' Ken is without question an enormously talented young man , ' ' observes RSC director Ron Daniels . ' ' And he ' s got it all : amazing instinct , technique , intelligence . . . as well as being immensely charismatic . . . . Every marvelous review that ' s been given to him he absolutely deserves. ' ' // In person the tousled , blond young man is equally impressive , but in a surprisingly different way . Courteous , thoughtful , disarmingly unpretentious , he exudes an acuity and inner strength far beyond his years . When asked how it feels to be standing on the threshold of uncommon fame , he searches for an honest answer. // ' ' After playing ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' m regarded in a different way , ' ' Branagh says in a warmer , far less clipped English accent than he uses on stage . ' ' I don ' t feel it when I get up in the morning ; but , for instance , I ' m sitting here talking with you . Before ' Henry ' that wouldn ' t have happened . . . . Nevertheless , when people say various things , that I ' m going to be this or that , I simply can ' t think in those terms . I ' m just me . I know where I live , I know who my parents are , I know that I have to go out and buy the milk. ' ' // As it happened , the afternoon on which we met marked a turning point in the young actor ' s life . After a 21-month stint , it was his last day with the RSC . How does he feel on such a momentous occasion , I asked during the rushed interval between a final matinee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Branagh replied , smiling wanly while slumped in his dressing room chair. // Indeed , during his time with the company , he ' s superbly played three other demanding roles . And , as so often with the packed RSC repertoire system , while rehearsing by day he performed late into the night , six days a week . Holidays were few . This underscores a problem for lead RSC actors which has been muttered about for a long while : the punishing schedule that makes two seasons ' work as draining as it is rewarding . Though Branagh has loved the experience , he says it ' s time for a taste of life outside the confines of Stratford and the Barbican . The RSC encourages it . ' ' They like you to go away , just for variety and freshness , ' ' he says . ' ' You come back then really hungry for a part. ' ' // He has much to keep him busy in the meantime . While many British actors expect to average 80 percent of their working year unemployed , Branagh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lined up the leads in two major British TV films - a biography of D. H. Lawrence and Henrik Ibsen ' s ' ' Ghosts ' ' - both of which will no doubt eventually make their way to America. // But Branagh is a man of many talents . Recently a group of RSC actors ambitiously put together an informal drama event , tongue-in-cheekly known as Not-the-RSC Festival . For it he wrote , directed , and scored a bitingly clever musical about the relationship between actors and directors . ' ' Tell Me Honestly , ' ' as the satire is called , was so applauded by critics and audiences ( and directors ) alike , in fact , that it was snapped up by a well-known London playhouse . With so much going for him , it ' s not surprising that Branagh doesn ' t want to limit himself to the stage , or even to acting . ' ' I ' d like to do a bit more writing , and certainly more directing , both on stage and on film . . . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' just to be totally megalomaniacal. ' ' // But if colleagues ' comments are anything to go by , Branagh isn ' t megalomaniacal in the slightest . As one leading RSC actress put it : ' ' Ken is absolutely boundless . There ' s no question about it . We ' re only seeing the tip of the iceberg. ' ' // // // // //
