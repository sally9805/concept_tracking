It is inspired because it allows Olivier to roll his eyes , thrust his tongue against the inside of his mouth , and fly off into outrageous snits . It is miscasting because it calls on him to play opposite Jackie Gleason . " You ' re a man of distinction , class - anyone can see that , " Sir Laurence says obsequiously , and it is absolutely no reflection on Mr. Gleason that under the circumstances this seems like an unlikely honor for him to bear. // For Mr. Gleason , a portly actor , is just sitting there , portraying a retired accountant who wears a red carnation in his blue blazer . One man ' s floral decoration , however , is another man ' s affectation , and the general result is to make Mr. Gleason look like a race track tout . Meanwhile , short of making up Olivier for a character role , there is just no way he is not going to look elegant . Mr. Gleason ' s character should be obsequious to Mr. Olivier ' s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Johnson " is not so much a play as it is a dramatized short story . It begins with Mr. Halpern , who is Mr. Olivier , standing by the grave of his wife , interred that day after a marriage of many years . Mr. Johnson - Mr. Gleason - materializes in the foreground and walks up to the grave . He asks if he may cast a flower onto the coffin . Mr. Olivier regards him suspiciously. // " You ' re not Jewish , " he says. // " Is it that obvious ? " Mr. Gleason replies . " Have I committed a sartorial indiscretion ? " // In fact , Mr. Gleason ' s Mr. Johnson is wearing a big black fedora and a black overcoat with a white handkerchief flowing out of the breast pocket . Presumably , he is dressed this way to show he is serious about attending the funeral , but it really does make him look a bit vulgar . Whether this means he doesn ' t look Jewish is moot , but whatever it means it is certain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sartorial indiscretion . " Ralph Kramden of " The Honeymooners , " however , used words like that all the time , especially when he wanted to impress Ed Norton . Mr. Gleason does himself a disservice by using them here . Right off , his Mr. Johnson is resonant with reminders of a bus driver. // Six weeks after the funeral , Mr. Halpern and Mr. Johnson , who have not seen each other since , meet for a drink in a very gentlemanly bar . Mr. Halpern has wondered why Mr. Johnson was at the grave . After all , he had never laid eyes on him before . Mr. Halpern is full of bonhomie until Mr. Johnson tells him that he had a liaison with his wife , the former Florence Shinkowitz , before she was married . Worse , they had continued to see one another , although in a chaste , platonic way , three times ( or " thrice , " as Mr. Gleason says ) a year. // // And that ' s about all there is to the story , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down - first in the bar and then in an adjoining restaurant . Lionel Goldstein , who wrote the script , has really written an extended anecdote with no dramatic action . Mr. Gleason is full of aphorisms - " Age , " he says , " the only enemy with which man can ' t establish a peace treaty " - and for the most part he is the straight man . He tells the story , leaving Mr. Olivier to react to what he hears. // And what is wondrous is that Mr. Olivier does react . It is wondrous because there is no chemistry between the two actors at all ; they seem to occupy separate planets . And it is wondrous because Mr. Olivier has no more good lines thrown his way than does Mr. Gleason . Moreover , he really has no place to take his character ; he is supposed to be sputtering from almost beginning to end , the rage leavened only by slyness . His Mr. Halpern is a ragbag of cliches and second-hand sentiments. // Mr. Olivier , however , has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . Close up on a big movie screen the face might be overwhelming , but on the small screen it is really rather beautiful . " I ' m so bloody angry , " Mr. Olivier says , choking on the words until they fall back in his throat , while the camera does nothing but stare . There are things going on in that face - hurt , disappointment , anger , a feeling of betrayal - and I don ' t recall Mr. Olivier saying anything else until frustration gets the best of him and he spits out , " If Flo were here , I ' d murder her . " The word murder comes out in a gargle , attenuated over more syllables than it actually has. // Olivier , one suspects , is enjoying himself in much of this , and sometimes he seems to be playing a game with the unaware Mr. Gleason . His Mr. Halpern harbors a secret - that years ago he cheated on Flo with a secretary in the cardbox-box factory . At least that ' s what the script @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Gleason ' s Mr. Johnson is led to believe . But I ' ll bet that Mr. Olivier , rolling his eyes at heaven , insisting that he ' ll " say nothing , " when you know he is dying to tell us everything , isn ' t thinking about a female secretary at all . I think he ' s playing a joke , and if he ' s not I don ' t want to hear about it . There is a moment when he talks about bringing his wife coffee every morning , and then coming back a half- hour later with the toast carefully buttered . He moves his hands magically , showing us the great pains he had to take , and suggesting that Flo was a cross he had to bear . I ' m not sure his Mr. Halpern was ever anywhere near a cardboard-box factory , but maybe it doesn ' t matter at all. // So , chalk up a small point for HBO , which sometimes seems to be giving its subscribers endless showings of Burt Reynolds , Clint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gimmick in " Mr. Halpern and Mr. Johnson , " and although the film is not art , it is at least Olivier . Next month , HBO offers Elizabeth Taylor and Carol Burnett in a new movie , and the other day it said it had signed Glenda Jackson and Jason Robards for another new movie . It also plans to star Sophia Loren in " Callas . " If Olivier can play Mr. Halpern , the possibilities are endless when you think of who might play Aristotle Onassis. // //
