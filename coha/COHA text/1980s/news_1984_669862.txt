Operating profit before taxes , interest and general corporate expenses rose 54% to $159. 1 million in the second quarter from $103. 3 million a year earlier .

CBS led its rivals at American Broadcasting Cos. and RCA Corp.

There was modest improvement in operating profit at CBS ' s publishing and toy divisions , and its musical-instruments business continued to incur losses . CBS ' s total operating profit margin improved sharply during the first half to 21% from 9% in the 1983 period . Although analysts expect CBS to continue to report higher earnings , they say the company won ' t be able to keep up the pace of the first two quarters . Wall Street analysts estimate CBS ' s 1984 per-share earnings at $8. 20 to $8. 75 , compared with $6. 31 in 1983 . Summer generally is a sluggish time for broadcasters , and analysts say the high cost of covering political conventions and the presidential campaigns will affect second-half profit .
