Bernard Hanon , the chairman of the board of Renault , the nationally owned French automaker , was sleeping at the Carlyle Hotel in New York City two weeks ago when the ax fell . At 4 a.m. an aide called from Paris to read him a front- page article from the pro-Socialist daily Le Matin . The paper announced that Hanon , 53 , would soon be replaced by Georges Besse , 57 , chairman of the Pechiney state-owned aluminum conglomerate . Shocked and angry , Hanon caught the next Concorde back to Paris . Summoned to Premier Laurent Fabius ' office early last week , Hanon was forced to resign . Two days later the French Cabinet confirmed Besse 's appointment . <P> Held up by the Socialists as a model of an efficiently run nationalized French industry , Renault has been engulfed in red ink since Hanon took over three years ago . Last year it fell from first to sixth place in sales among European automobile firms and lost nearly $1 billion . <P> Hanon 's defenders argue that he was made the scapegoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the entire French auto industry has been hard hit by recession and government austerity measures ; total car sales in France dropped by 12.9% in 1984 . Moreover , Hanon was hampered by the government in trying to trim his work force of 98,000 . Says one company official : " The government asked too much of Bernard Hanon , to be an effective corporate executive and to run Renault as a social showcase . " Hanon attempted to toe that fine line with a plan that called for a reduction of some 9,000 jobs . Although the proposal did not involve any forced layoffs , it was rejected last month by the unions . <P> Ironically , Hanon had been a major contributor to the firm 's earlier successes . Known jokingly as " l'americain " among his colleagues , he received both an M.B.A . and a doctorate in economics at Columbia University before becoming Renault 's U.S. marketing director in 1959 . Hanon spent his 26-year career at Renault earning a reputation as a visionary car executive . The architect of Renault 's move into the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful R-5 subcompact ( Le Car ) in the 1970s . The company now owns 46% of American Motors and 41% of Mack Trucks . Both have become profitable bright spots in the company 's panorama of gloom . AMC made an estimated $15 million last year , after years of losses , while Mack has been in the black since Renault bought into the heavy-truck manufacturer in mid-1983 . <P> But Hanon could not escape blame for a number of recent strategic errors . Renault 's new Super-5 turned out to be too expensive ( $4,095 ) for a two-door subcompact and looked too much like the old R-5 . Early sales have run about 25% below projections . Conversely , demand for the new top-of-the-line R-25 has far outstripped production levels . Concedes a French government official : " In the all-out war that the auto industry has become , such errors are fatal . "
