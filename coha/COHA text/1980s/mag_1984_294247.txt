She was riding a downtown subway in Manhattan at 3 a.m. on Christmas night when a photographer asked her to pose for a picture . Thus began the modeling career of Lisa Sliwa , national director of the Guardian Angels civilian vigilante group and wife of Angels Founder Curtis Sliwa , 30 . Newly signed by the Zoli agency , the Chicago-bred , 5-ft. 9-in. , 125-Ib. brunette , who says she is 25 , still plans to spend her nights riding the city 's trains with her husband and thinks her new occupation can help the old . " Most women believe modeling is more feminine than patrolling the subways , so I 'll be able to relate to them better , " explains Sliwa . " You do n't have to be a gorilla to defend yourself , and you do n't have to be a Nerf-brain to be a model . " Nor to figure out that a $2,000-a-day modeling fee can buy a lot of subway tokens . <P> <P> Boy George , move over . <P> Joe Namath , 40 , the sexy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donning pantyhose for a TV commercial , has again dropped his pants , so to speak .

" It is not hard to guess that the city is Washington , D.C. , but the identity of the speaker might come as a surprise to those who thought of Rosalynn Carter , 56 , as a down-home sort of woman who was never comfortable with the insider preening and cosseting that embroider life in the nation 's capital . In town last week to see old friends and attend a signing party for her new book , First Lady from Plains ( which will be excerpted in PEOPLE magazine next week ) , Carter acknowledged , " The social scene is a very important part of political Washington , and we probably should have got involved . But even if Jimmy were ever to come back here , I do n't think he would do it differently . It 's just not part of his makeup .
