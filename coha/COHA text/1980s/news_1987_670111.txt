The stock market ' s New Year ' s rally carried the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its first close above 2000 yesterday . Though the market wasn ' t nearly as strong as Wednesday ' s 19-point drive , steady buying by investors was enough to overcome spates of profit-taking and selling by some investors whenever the average pokes above a century-mark milestone . The average closed at 2002. 25 , up 8. 30 . " I ' m excited . This is history , " said Jack Baker , head of capital commitment for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York . " I caught 1000 and 2000 and I hope to live long enough to catch 3000 . " Depressed by tax-related selling at the end of 1986 , the market rally began explosively on Jan. 2 . The industrial average has gained 106. 3 points in 1987 ' s first five sessions . The industrial average has climbed 1100. 94 points , or 122% since August 1982 , the start of the current bull market . This four-year surge has been fueled by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drop in inflation and extremely aggressive demand for stocks from some non-traditional investors such as corporations and foreigners . What has been missing from this bull market has been such traditional elements as a strong economy and robust increases in corporate profits . The economy has grown sluggishly in the past two years , and corporate profits have actually declined about 3% since peaking in 1984 . " If someone told me a year ago that the Dow Jones Industrials were going to rise 500 points with no earnings growth , I would have said they were cuckoo , " says Robert Kirby , chairman of Capital Guardian Trust Co. in Los Angeles . " But lower interest rates have fueled this rally , and that ' s a legitimate rationale " for higher stock prices . By one measure , stock prices have risen far more than earnings . The ratio of the prices of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average to the past 12 months of profit for those companies was 16. 2 on Jan. 2 , compared with 9 in June 1982 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by dividends and corporate earnings . You can only do lower interest rates to a degree , and most of that is behind us , " Mr. Kirby says , " I believe that in 1987 , if we don ' t get higher earnings , the market won ' t go anywhere . " Several other market forecasters are similarly skeptical , although a few are still quite bullish . As for the industrial average ' s move past a millenary milestone yesterday , most market professionals claimed to take it all in stride . For instance , Newton Zinder , a technical analyst with E.F. Hutton &; Co. in New York , observed that 2000 is " one point higher than 1999 . " And in the New York trading room of Jefferies &; Co. , a Los Angeles-based brokerage with an aggressive reputation , it was business as usual . " The old pros here haven ' t batted an eye . They ' re more interested in writing tickets , " said Martin Krouner , manager of listed trading in New York . Jeffrey Skelton , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossing 2000 to " driving into a new state for the first time . For the first 10 seconds , you ' re excited to realize that you ' ve never been there before . But then it ' s just like anywhere else , and you start looking for the McDonald ' s . " For all their efforts to appear blase , though , stock-market professionals said they couldn ' t quite shrug off the 2000 milestone . Logically , 2000 " isn ' t anything more than a coincidence of a lot of individual stock prices , " says David Testa , president of T. Rowe Price Associates ' Growth Stock mutual fund . " But subliminally , we ' re all affected by it . " Many people seem to feel that way , because the Dow Jones Industrial Average has become the most widely watched stock-market barometer , even if not the most highly esteemed by investment professionals . It was developed by Charles Dow , the first editor of The Wall Street Journal and co-founder of Dow Jones &; Co . The first average of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way for Mr. Dow to explain stock-market movements to his readers . The average , published irregularly until 1896 , first crossed 100 on Jan. 12 , 1906 . In 1928 , the industrial average was expanded to include 30 stocks  --  the current number . The index weighed in at 240. 01 in October of that year , just 12 months before the market crash that ushered in the Depression . ( The Dow Jones Transportation Average , which has 20 stocks , was created in 1970 as the successor to a railroad index dating back to 1896 . The utility average , which now has 15 stocks , started in 1929 . ) Crossing 1000 took a lot longer than surpassing 2000 . The industrial average had settled in a range of 500 to almost 1000 for about 20 years . During the bull market of the 1960s , it came close to 1000 several times . The industrial index first crossed the 1000 mark on Nov. 14 , 1972 , but fell back days later . It took until December 1982  --  and an additional 30 temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher ground . Strictly in point terms , the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen about 150% the past two decades , from 785. 69 at the end of 1966 . But what if the index were adjusted for inflation and dividends ? If the index were adjusted for inflation alone , the picture would be grim . Consumer prices have more than tripled since the mid-1960s , while prices of the 30 industrial stocks haven ' t kept pace . M.C. Horsey , a Salisbury , Md. , research firm , computes that in 1966 dollars , the industrial average currently is barely at 600  --  well below its level two decades ago . But that calculation doesn ' t include a steady stream of dividends from the index stocks . If these payouts were reinvested , while steadily adjusting for inflation , the Dow Jones industrials wouldn ' t fare so badly . In fact , calculations by Wilshire Associates in Santa Monica , Calif. , show that in 1966 dollars , the Dow Jones industrials with dividends reinvested would be at 1391 or so today . That amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wilshire says . Yesterday , ironically , the industrial average was the worst-performing of the major market barometers , though it set its fourth consecutive record close . The average had languished throughout much of the session  --  even showing a loss at some points  --  while the broader market was running strongly . Indeed , two other market barometers finished at highs . Standard &; Poor ' s 500-stock index advanced 1. 95 to 257. 28 , and the New York Stock Exchange composite index moved up 1. 12 to 147. 55 . Both indexes surpassed records set the previous day . And the smaller-capitalization stocks in the over-the-counter market continued to outperform the blue-chip issues . The Nasdaq OTC composite rose 5. 05 to 377. 54 , up 8. 23% so far this year , compared with a 5. 6% gain for the industrial average . Extremely important to market participants is that as the rally rolls on , trading activity keeps building .

Climbing crude oil prices continued to hold back transportation stocks . While most of the major indexes advanced strongly , the Dow Jones Transportations Average edged up 0. 85 to 843. 27 .

AMR fell 3/4 to 55 7/8 , Delta Air Lines lost 1/2 to 49 1/4 , NWA dropped 1 to 62 3/4 and UAL declined 3/4 to 53 1/2 .
