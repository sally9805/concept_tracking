' ' Those nuns just fixed the place up , ' ' says Jan , a mason . ' ' It was crumbling before. ' ' // ' ' The Jews should never have come to a foreign city and acted like that , ' ' adds Stefania , a factory worker . ' ' The fence clearly says ' No trespassing. ' ' ' // // ' ' Sure , a lot of Jews died there , ' ' admits Artur , another machinist . ' ' But lots of Poles , lots of everybody , also died here. ' ' // These Roman Catholic Poles live near the former Auschwitz death camp , the ultimate symbol of Nazi genocide . Baffled and saddened , they can not understand why the vigil of 14 Carmelite nuns in a convent on the camp ' s perimeter angers Jews , as well as many non-Jews , around the world. // At issue is not just a theological misunderstanding between the two religious groups over the proper way to deal with death . What ' s been uncovered is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and almost 2 , 000 years of tension between Catholics and Jews. // The convent has become a more emotional subject in Poland than even Solidarity ' s historic assumption of power . Talk to a Pole about new Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki , and he ' ll grumble about difficulties making ends meet . Talk to a Pole about the nuns at Auschwitz , and he ' ll respond with a torrent of words about the sanctity of prayer , Polish suffering in World War II , and his own ties to Auschwitz. // ' ' What terrible timing ! ' ' says Maciej Kozlowski , an editor at the liberal Roman Catholic weekly , Tygodnik Powszechny . ' ' We have so many more important problems at this moment. ' ' // Five years ago , the Carmelite nuns moved into an old brick building on the outer edge of Auschwitz . Erected during World War II as a cinema for Austrian troops billeted in the camp , it was used by the Nazis as a warehouse. // The nuns received permission from the Polish minister of culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers to fix the structure . The adjacent lot was turned into a garden , with a 24-foot cross in the center. // The cloistered nuns spend their days in prayer for those who died and contemplation to prevent such an evil from recurring . As members of the Carmelite Order , the nuns do not speak to each other . Through their suffering , they believe Auschwitz ' s sin can be overcome. // ' ' Poles are a religious people , and in places of crisis , we put places of prayer , ' ' says Leszek Haponik , a guide at the Auschwitz museum . ' ' For us , it is a holy place . Respect should be shown. ' ' // No similar concept of redemption through prayer exists in Judaism . The Jewish prayer of mourning , the Kaddish , exalts God . It does not even mention the dead . From this perspective , Jews found the presence of the nuns at Auschwitz troubling. // ' ' People of good faith here in the church just weren ' t aware of the reasons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gebert , a leader of the small Polish-Jewish community. // After a series of meetings between Roman Catholic and Jewish leaders in 1986 and 1987 , the misunderstanding was thrashed out . Church officials promised to relocate the convent by February , 1989 , to a nearby center for Jewish-Christian dialogue . But when the deadline passed without the relocation , it was clear that something deeper was at dispute - the very nature of the Holocaust. // Approximately 4 million people perished at Auschwitz , of whom at least 2. 5 million were Jews . Some experts contend the percentage of Jews even was as high as 90 percent. // Within Poland , however , the Jewish aspect of the Holocaust long has been underplayed , even neglected . Barracks at the Auschwitz museum have been turned into memorials for all nationalities . Official guides rarely mention Jews . Most often they refer in generic terms to ' ' prisoners ' ' and ' ' victims . ' ' As Mr. Haponik insists , ' ' People from 28 different countries were killed here. ' ' // ' ' Poles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasp the difference between what happened to them and what happened to the Jews , ' ' argues Mr. Gebert of the Polish-Jewish community . ' ' They think of themselves as victims , so it is hard for them to see others as victims. ' ' // Poles believe the world never has appreciated the depth of their own wartime suffering . The Germans leveled most of the country ' s major cities and killed more than 3 million non-Jewish Poles , a larger proportion than in any other occupied country. // ' ' Poles feel they are unjustly treated , ' ' argues Jacek Wosniakowski , editor of the Roman Catholic publishing house ZNAK and author of an article calling on the nuns to leave Auschwitz . ' ' They weren ' t the mass murderers. ' ' // Fueled by this fundamental misunderstanding , the convent dispute escalated . After church officials said that relocation proved more difficult than expected , Jewish groups responded with a series of demonstrations . At one , a rabbi from New York and a group of followers jumped over the convent fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident , televised around the world , caused a sensation . For Jews , it showed Polish anti-Semitism . Polish Catholics were outraged that demonstrators violated the sanctity of a convent. // ' ' All we saw was somebody preventing Polish sisters from praying on Polish soil , ' ' recalls Mr. Kozlowski . This memory , he adds , uncovered other memories of communists closing monasteries in the 1950s , as well as the common perception in Poland that most original Polish communists were Jews . ' ' The violent Jewish reaction , ' ' he says , ' ' provoked a violent Polish reaction. ' ' // It came from none other than Cardinal Jozef Glemp , primate of Poland . Speaking before 100 , 000 people at the Czestochowa shrine , Cardinal Glemp departed from his prepared speech to launch an attack against the Jewish demonstrators . He accused them of wanting to kill the nuns . He accused Jews in general of talking down to Poles and using their ' ' control ' ' over the media to spread anti-Polish sentiment. // His remarks met strong criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even after the cardinal demanded renegotiation of the original agreement to move the convent , only a few intellectuals dared disagree . Most of them failed to perceive the real reasons for Jewish anger . ZNAK ' s Wosniakowski wrote that the convent should be moved , not out of respect for Jewish understanding of the Holocaust , but simply because it offended them. // ' ' Jews should not monopolize suffering , they should realize that other millions were killed , among them Poles , ' ' he said in an interview . ' ' But we signed a contract to move the convent . We should keep it. ' ' // No simple solution seems in sight . Prime Minister Mazowiecki , himself closely tied to the Polish church , has refused comment. // ' ' It would be political suicide for Mazowiecki if he said something , ' ' explains Tygodnik Powszechny ' s Kozlowski . ' ' He would spend the next two months dealing with this issue instead of our more pressing problems. ' ' // But Mazowiecki may not be able to avoid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Polish economy. // To understand Western concern about anti-Semitism and the Holocaust , Poles will need a free open debate . Gebert , the Polish-Jewish leader , points out that West Germany has dealt with the Holocaust legacy in a much more constructive fashion than his homeland . He hopes that Poland ' s new democracy will precipitate a similar soul-searching. // ' ' These problems get worked out in democracies , ' ' he says . ' ' World Jewry might force Polish Catholics to withdraw the convent . It would be much better if we could convince them to understand why the convent should be moved. ' ' // //
