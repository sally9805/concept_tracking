In the noisy confluence of publicity pronouncements , news bulletins , market analyses , gadfly lawsuits and expert pontifications on the momentous Coca-Cola controversy , the Republic seemed to shudder for an instant last week , then right itself and face toward the flag . In the midst of all the foaming and burbling , though , Americans demonstrated some interesting reactions toward the whole process of change . <P> Some things , clearly , they would rather not have changed at all , no matter what any market surveys seem to predict . " Baseball , hamburgers , Coke  --  they 're all the fabric of America , " cried Gay Mullins , the much quoted Seattle real estate man and triumphant noisemaker who filed suit to prevent the company from depriving him of the pause that refreshes . <P> Well , are n't they ? And yet what is more American than trying to change them ? Or arguing about the changes ? <P> Take baseball . Did n't they ruin it when they started using designated hitters instead of letting the pitcher strike out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in lights and started playing at night ? Or when they expanded the major leagues from 16 teams to 26 ? Or the schedule from 154 games to 162 ? ( Did Roger Maris break Babe Ruth 's record of 60 home runs by hitting 61  --  but in eight extra games ? ) Babe Ruth  --  bah ! Some truly venerable curmudgeons share Ring Lardner 's view that they really ruined the game when they introduced the jackrabbit ball during the Babe 's heyday to make home runs easier . <P> The general idea that change is popular , and therefore increases sales , threatens all kinds of cherished institutions . If lots of people can destroy an institution by telling a pollster that they prefer soft drinks to be sweeter and lighter , will the next step be for meat-packers to start producing a low-calorie hamburger by just adding a lot of airy filler ? And will somebody then try combining it with goat cheese ? Is anything safe ? Will Hershey bars be filled with raisins and Oreo cookies with pink icing ? Will apple pie be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if one is inclined to resist change for the sake of change , one must resist the instinct to oppose all change . Some new things are definite improvements on the old . Pampers are better than diapers . Ballpoint pens are better than fountain pens , and cheaper too . LP records are better than the old 78s that could play only about one-fifth of the Fifth Symphony and cracked if you even looked at them too hard . ( But now that we have thrown away all the 78s , do we really have to throw away all the LPs and invest in digital laser-beam compact superrecords ? ) <P> Technology occasionally does bring genuine improvements . Tetracycline and Thorazine heal the sick . The rotary lawn mower does n't get stuck on twigs . The VCR makes it possible for working people who are not insomniacs to look at movies that are shown only at 3 a.m . Does anyone remember that you once had to bend over and give a violent turn to a hand crank before a car would start ?      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
