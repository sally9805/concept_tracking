txt It was the winter of 1776 , near Boston , when a corps of recruits from backwoods Virginia marched into the encampment of Massachusetts ' rugged " Marblehead " regiment . The veterans jeered and hooted at the newcomers ' ruffled and fringed uniforms . Snowballs flew , then fists . Within minutes perhaps a thousand American soldiers were biting , gouging and flailing at each other with fists and feet . A lone officer galloped past , leaped " into the thickest of the melee ( and ) with an iron grip seized two tall , brawny , athletic , savage-looking riflemen by the The Bookshelf " The Revolution Remembered : Eyewitness Accounts of the War for Independence " Edited by John C.

Dann , than in the stiff , aloof figure of Stuart portraits and most history books . This was a warm , caring and wise Washington , alternately father figure and superhero to the foot soldiers , drummers and washerwomen who saw him close-up and lived to talk about It 50 years after the war . Few common soldiers emerged from the Revolutionary War with formal discharge papers . They were in and out of army services repeatedly , often drafted for as little as a month , or recruited for a single march or battle . As Guilford Dudley , who served five terms of enlistment put it , describing the American rout at Camden : " It is well known that everybody , after this disastrous battle was over or during the conflict , discharged himself . " In 1832 Congress granted pensions for all who had served in the Continental Army for six months or more . Some 80,000 pension seekers gave oral accounts of battles , marches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials as evidence of their wartlmg service . John C. Dann , director of the Clements Library at the University of Michigan , read all 80,000 pension applications in the National Archives and picked 79 of the most interesting and accurate for this book . Here are ordinary folks from diverse lifestyles and regions , townsmen , frontier scouts , spies , Indian captives , two women , two blacks who fought and bought their way to freedom , teachers , rogues , heroes , fools . Mr. Dann might have picked fewer of them , say about 60 , for some accounts are tedious , others repetitious . But he has thoughtfully prefaced each with a summary of the highlights , so the dull ones are easily spotted and skipped . What 's here is oral history as their grandchildren must have heard it . It 's still good fun two centuries later , overhearing these experiences of the tumult of everyday life and seeing a frontlines view of one of the most unusual armies ever to fight , let alone win . Their tales of combat , hardship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and create new images to replace some old perceptions . For instance , most of our forefathers were n't wily woodsmen . Richard Vining , lost in the woods during Arnold 's march to Quebec , was alone for three days " without a mouthful of provisions " because he did n't know which berries to eat and it was too cloudy to see the sun . And those fearsome trackers , the Indians , who could chase an enemy at a dead run through densest forests and darkest nights  --  well , they had help . They set their dogs on the enemy 's trail and followed the yelping , snarling pack . Besides a knack for breaking up brawls , Washington had a charisma that could dissuade a single weary soldier from deserting or quell a regimental mutiny , and witnesses recount both . Washington was nearly killed several times , and no wonder . John Suddarth , then serving three months as a substitute for his brother , tells how the Commander in Chief at Yorktown " during a tremendous cannonade from the British " mounted the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as thick as hail " and stood studying the enemy defenses through his telescope . Israel Putnam was almost a folk hero to his own troops . But Joseph Rundel discloses the true story of " Old Put 's " famous ride down the steep steps at Greenwich Meetinghouse to escape capture . Notwithstanding the inscription on the monument erected later by the Daughters of the American Revolution , Put rode only about one-fifth of the way down before he had the good sense to dismount and lead his horse the rest of the way . That makes his flight all the more remarkable , if less dignified ; Mr. Runde ! , scrambling down right behind him , was captured . Snippets of local history abound in accounts of how depredations of guerrilla warfare kept civilian life in turmoil in much of the new nation . Westchester County , N.Y. , was a no-man 's land , with bands of Tories , British soldiers and Americans roving back and forth , reconnoitering , raiding and looting . The beaches of Cape Cod , Long Island and New Jersey were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could . The humor and horrors of war are here aplenty . John McCasland , a Pennsylvania sharpshooter , tells of drawing lots to see who 'd pick off a Hessian sentinel . McCasland lost , but kindly shot the guard in the hip and the man 's comrades immediately surrendered , holding a large bottle of rum " at arm 's length as a flag of truce . " But for William Gipson of South Carolina , frontier warfare was unsparingly brutal . His widowed mother was tied and whipped by Tories , her house burned , her property destroyed . Gipson tells of murdering one Tory prisoner and " spiketing " another ? standing him on a spike driven through a block of wood and turning him around and around until the spike worked its way through boot and foot . John Mersereau , a Staten Islander , tells how easily the British controlled the New York City prison population . They held some prisoners several days without food , then gave them poisoned bread .
