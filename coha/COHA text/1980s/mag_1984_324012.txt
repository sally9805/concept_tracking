Sikhs and Hindus engage in frenzied clashes <P> In normal circumstances , entering the Golden Temple at Amritsar , Punjab , the holiest of Sikh shrines , is a serene and majestic experience . Over the past few weeks , however , the temple has become a formidable fortress . Religious symbols mix with modern rifle muzzles , automatic weapons , swords and battle-axes . Even women are armed , and some children as young as five have daggers hanging from their belts . The Sikhs , a sect of 12 million that broke with Hinduism at the end of the 15th century , are known equally for being charitable hosts and aggressive warriors . Today they seem solely the latter , as they are preparing for what may be the battle of their lives . Their increased demands for political and religious autonomy in the Punjab and their use of violence to enforce those demands have made them virtual enemies of the government and the Hindus who once lived peacefully in their midst . The Sikhs have become a grave concern for Prime Minister Indira Gandhi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest , most volatile crisis this government has faced since the days of partition . " <P> Resistance to Sikh militancy from Hindus in the Punjab and the neighboring state of Haryana has raised the latest violence to alarming levels . Within the past two months , at least 88 people have died and almost 250 have been wounded in frenzied clashes . In one instance , Sikh extremists threw a grenade into a Hindu religious festival in Amritsar . Three people were killed , 51 injured . The Hindus quickly became an outraged mob , charging the police and accusing them of favoring the Sikhs . Unable to contain the crowd with their long bamboo poles , police opened fire with tear gas and finally , in desperation , with bullets . Before the riot was over , the crowd had burned and looted many Sikh shops and smashed to bits Sikh-owned scooters and bicycles . <P> Ever since India 's independence in 1947 , the Sikhs claim , they have faced discrimination . Before then they had enjoyed preferential treatment in the armed forces and civil services , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those privileges were lost , and the Sikhs became politically subservient to the Hindu majority . Soon they began agitating for their own state . In 1966 they were given Punjab by the federal government . Although that state has India 's richest , most fertile land , the Sikhs still felt their portion was too small compared with that of neighboring Haryana , the state created at the same time for the Hindus . Therefore , the Akali Dal Party , the political arm of the Sikhs , began an insistent drumbeat of peaceful protest . In 1973 the Akalis passed a resolution setting out various religious and political demands , among them that Punjab 's capital , Chandigarh , be made a Sikh capital exclusively , and Amritsar a holy city . <P> Two years ago , an extreme right-wing Sikh faction emerged , thus turning the protest aggressive and radical . Its fanatical leader , Sant Jarnail Bhindranwale , 36 , now commands at least 1,000 armed followers from the most sacred room of the Golden Temple . Hindus have begun to fear that the demands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's movement gains momentum . Even when Gandhi assured them that they would not be let down , Hindus organized to combat the Sikh threat .
