txt // a host of technical achievements that made the demonstration such a suc-cess . There were no exaggerated claims made for any major technical breakthroughs . Mention was made of the fact that the Bell Telephone Laboratories had been working on the project for several years and the demonstration required the services of almost 1000 men.67 It was in fact the best demonstration of a mechanical television system ever made to this time . It would be several more years before any other system could even begin to compare with it in picture quality . In April 1927 Kenjiro Takayanagi of the Hamamatsu Higher Technical School of Japan carried out successful experiments using a cathode ray receiver . Takayanagi had built quite an ingenious system around a Tokyo Denki gas-filled oscillograph tube . He used a 40-hole Nipkow disc that rotated at 14 rev/sec . A flying spot system of Rignoux was used with two GE photocells . The use of the Nipkow disc meant that Takayanagi had to have a linear time-base generator . This was supplied with horizontal pulses from the rotating disc , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell . The vertical pulse came from a larger hole in the disc . The scanning currents and sync pulses were fed to the cathode ray tube , and it was claimed that they worked quite satisfactorily . // This is the first recorded use of horizontal and vertical pulses generated by means of a photocell . The received image was about 4 by 5 cm square on a green screen , the number of picture elements about 1600 . The images were recognizable as faces , and " identification was somehow possible . " Takayanagi predicted that future Braun tubes would be both high vacuum and high voltage . And there would have to be some 100,000 elements for the picture to be practical.68 At this time only Takayangi in Japan and the Bell Telephone Labs in the United States were using Nipkow discs for scanning , with Braun tubes for reception . As a result , they were using unidirectional , linear scanning . Belin and Holweck as well as Dauvillier in France were using vibrating mirrors for scanning , with Braun tubes for reception with sine-wave scanning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ray tubes , was also using sine-wave scanning in conjunction with his first electric camera tubes . All of the other pioneers , including Baird , Alexanderson , Jenkins , von Mihaly , and Karolus , were using some form of Nipkow disc , prism or mirror drum for their television experiments . Max Dieckmann seemed to have stopped working on a television system . On April 20 , 1927 , Campbell Swinton wrote to Dr. Alexanderson discussing the merits of cathode ray television . He hoped that someone would " be induced to follow the cathode-ray idea up seriously . " Not knowing of the laboratory efforts of Dr. Ives , who was actually working on cathode ray television at the time , Campbell Swinton stated his hopes to Dr. Alexanderson , who unfortunately never thought much of the idea.69 Meanwhile , experiments were still being conducted with cathode ray reception at the Bell Telephone Labs . On May 1 , 1927 , Frank Gray related the advantages of using a uniform sweep in one direction with a cathode // ray tube . He described the method they were using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scanning disc at the transmitting end . A condenser was charged and quickly discharged through a resis-tance . The voltage across the resistance was applied to one pair of metal plates in the cathode ray tube . As a result , the beam moved across the tube with a practically constant velocity and was quickly jerked back to repeat the motion again . A similar movement of the beam was used in a vertical direction . This resulted in a beam tracing the screen repeatedly in the same direction , at a constant velocity , in a series of parallel lines one after the other . It was possible to receive simple television pictures on a tube operated in this manner.70 Early in May 1927 , Dr. Alexanderson had Ray D. Kell , who was work ing in the Testing Department of General Electric , come to work for him on his television project . By May 21 , 1927 , Kell and Paul A. Kober had developed and demonstrated a television system of 48 lines . It was pro-jected onto a small screen by means of a high-frequency mercury light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Kell was soon to he guiding the General Electric/Alexanderson television project.71 // It was reported that on May 24 , 1927 , John L. Baird had transmitted television images from his laboratory in London to Glasgow , Scotland , a distance of some 438 miles . This was done using ordinary telephone lines . It was claimed that the images were " recognizable " and steady in position.72 In June 1927 J.L. Baird reported that he had abandoned the rotating disc of lenses in favor of two rotating slotted discs with a block of cellular or honeycomb appearance . This was supposed to break up the strips or line images into finer images made up of dots . A similar block at the receiver was used to recreate the picture . At this time it was also reported that Baird had devised a " phonoscope " for recording the television signal . This was a machine for preserving radio pictures by means of phonograph records . Although it was stated that some records had been made and that every object seemed to have its own " sound " there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visual images . An illustration showed a disc cylinder of the old Edison type , not the flat disc of Berliner . This was the first of a long series of " new ideas " created to keep Baird 's financial backers content.73 In July 1927 the television scheme of Georges Valensi , chief engineer of the French Post Office , was described . Valensi was credited with being one of the first inventors to have the idea of using cathode rays for television apparatus . His transmitter was restricted to either slides or opaques . Two powerful lamps illuminated the image , which was intercepted by two " stroboscobic discs . " These discs produced straight-line scanning of the image which was then passed through a collimator lens to a photocell . The discs were connected to the two circuits for creating the magnetic deflection of the electron beam in the Braun tube . A slow motor of 8 cycles/sec and a high speed motor of 800 cycles/sec were geared together so that only one synchronized signal was necessary to be sent to the telephone line . The receiving apparatus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Paris . It used a small amount of gas to concentrate the beam . Only 12 volts were necessary to modulate the beam . An anode voltage of 800 volts was applied to the perforated plate . Four magnetic coils located near the screen were fed wave profiles of isosceles triangles ( straight lines ) in perfect synchronism with the transmitter . No description of the pictures shown was given in this article . It was mentioned that recent experiments had somewhat neglected the cathode ray tube , and the developments of M. Valensi seemed to indicate that in that tube probably lay the solution of the television problem , with regard to cheap , compact and lightweight apparatus . The apparatus was built in collaboration with the Etablissements Gaiffe-Gallot-Pilon.74 In September 1927 an article on the apparatus of Eduoard Belin indicated that he was continuing his work on his television apparatus . The scanning rate was now 10 cycles vertically and 200 cycles horizontally , which meant a picture of 40 or less lines . This was an improvement in that // a radio transmitter had been previously designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meters . The transmitter used a water-cooled vacuum tube built by Holweck to keep down excessive heating on the lower wavelengths.75 On September 5 , 1927 , at the annual meeting of ' the British Association for the Advancement of Science , J.L. Baird demonstrated his newest system of television , called Noctovision . This differed from ordinary spot light scanning ( Baird still had not revealed that he was using this niet hod ) in that the subject sat in darkness and was subjected to a powerful beans of infrared radiation . This eliminates the bright lights but creates problems due to the special response of the infrared as compared to daylight . This demonstration was not very successful , with quite a bit of flicker and apparent fading of the picture . Baird had now settled into a pattern of producing many variations of his basic television system in order to keep his financial backers happy . ( This practice was to have severe repercussions during the next few years . ) Baird had promised to show his Phonovisor but did not . However , the reviewer congratulated Baird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Leeds meeting.76 Of far more importance were the event taking place in the laboratories of Philo T. Farnsworth in San Francisco . It is claimed that on September 7 , 1927 , he was able to transmit an " image " from one of his early camera tubes . It was no more than a moving blob of light that was reproduced on a receiving tube , but it proved that his new system would I work . At this time Farnsworth had the only operating camera tubes in the world . Due to the insensitivity of his tubes , only pictures from slides ( at first ) and , later on , motion pictures could be used . He had assistance from Herbert Metcalf and Bill Cummings . It is claimed that the first tube was built at California Institute of Technology by Cummings in 1926 . It was used for tests , but never transmitted a picture . Farnsworth also had the aid of his brother-in-law , Cliff Gardner , who had learned the art of glassblowing and was now building the dissector tubes.77 On September 14 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electrical Research Products ( a subsidiary of the Bell Labs ) applied for a patent for a system of television using motion picture film at either or both ends of a television system . At this time , the prospects for the " live " pickup of faces and events was quite dim . Even though the flying spot principle had made it possible to transmit pictures with halftones , it was limited to a small area swept by the flying spot . It was therefore planned to use the greater light-gathering capabilities ( higher sensitivity ) of motion picture film and quickly process it so that it could be transmitted by an existing television system . Motion picture film was to be recorded in an ordinary camera . After quick processing , the film was to be projected through a mechanical film scanner ( Nipkow disc ) , where its picture was converted into a picture signal . The accompanying // sound track would also be recorded so that both picture and sound would be in sync . A second variation was to be used for large screen television . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the face of the disc by a film camera , quickly processed , and sent to a special film pro jector , where it was projected onto a large screen by means of the usual arc lamp . Here also , the sound track was placed on the film in its proper position so that when the film was played back it was in sync . This was the first patent covering the recording of a television image for the express pur pose of displaying it on a large screen.78 On November 12 , 1927 , Robert C. Mathes of the Bell Telephone Lab-oratories applied for a patent for increasing the brightness of images on screens such as the Bell Labs large screen device . It was to have means for producing a field of view , the use of a plurality of condensers and means for charging the elements in succession periodically in accordance with the tone values of elemental areas of the field of view . It would also have a plurality of voltage-controlled repeaters associated conductively with the condenser elements and means , controlled by the repeaters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mathes claimed that the image produced by this method was considerably brighter than the image produced when only one clement was being actuated at a time and that it reduced flicker . Both Introduction of the Kinescope Ernst Alexanderson ( left ) and Ray Kell with a 1927 experimental home television receiver . Jr . This was the first demonstration of television by radio using " home receivers " instead of laboratory instruments.3 On January 20 , 1928 , Paul Selenyi of " Tungsram " Budapest-Upjest , Hungary , described a cathode-ray tube which was used to present figures on the end of the tube by dusting the outer surface of the tube with powdered sulphur . Selenyi used a V-shaped glowing cathode which was surrounded by an electrode and connected to a metal cap . The cathode rays passed through a circular opening in a cylinder maintained at a voltage of some 150-300 volts above that of the cathode . The inner surfaces of the glass bulb were coated with magnesium , and this metallic film formed the anode to which a pressure of 3000-4000 volts was being applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 microampere a marking velocity of 30km/sec. was obtained . A patent was filed by Selenyi on February 1 , 1928 , covering this tube for drawing electrical pictures . A further article described a tube with an accelerating field and one free of lines of force . The patent described the use of ' an electrode to concentrate the beam and a magnetic coil to focus the beam . There were means for varying the brightness and for deflecting // the beam in accordance to the phenomenon desired . There was reference to the electric transmission of pictures.4 On February 9 , 1928 , it was announced that John Baird had successfully transmitted an image from London to a receiving station at Hartsdale , New York , at midnight , London time . This was transmitted on 45 meters using 2kw of power . It was claimed that recognizable images were seen at the receiving end.5 Following this , it was later claimed that a television image was received on board the liner Berengaria while a thousand miles at sea . This was done on March 7 , 1928 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Development Company . This was in keeping with the Baird policy of exploring every facet of the new field of television ( and getting much-needed publicity ) to keep the public 's curiosity alive.6 All of this publicity was planned to sell receivers and stock in Baird Television . They put a homemade receiver kit on sale in February 1928 at Selfridge 's Store in London . Also , shares of stock in the Baird Company were being sold by ads , which were more often than not misleading . In March 1928 , the magazine Popular Wireless offered the Baird Company ? 1000 if it would simply televise 5 simple objects over a distance of 25 yards . This challenge was never accepted . By June 1928 , it was reported that " the Baird system is hopeless , after all . " 7 On February 25 , 1928 , the Bell Telephone Labs.gave a demonstration of their system of television using crystal-controlled quartz oscillators to effect synchronization between the transmitter and the receiver . These special oscillators were developed by J.W. Horton and W.A. Marrison . These oscillators also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube a current whose frequency was a simple fraction of it , such as a quarter , a fifth or a sixth . It also included special circuits to slowly change the speed of the motor to affect desired framing of the picture.8 V.K. Zworykin of the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company applied for a patent on a novel photoelectric tube on March 3 , 1928 . It consisted of a base layer of magnesium , which was then covered with a thin film of certain metals such as cesium or rubidium or potassium or a combination of them in order to get almost any desired relation between wavelength of radiation and electron emissivity . Zworykin preferred to use cesium trinitride . He claimed that his method would produce a sensitive , stable photocell that would be simple and cheap to manufacture . This appears to be the first reference to a cesium magnesium cell , which was considerably more efficient than the potassium hydrogen cell that was in more common use . Zworykin claimed that his gas-filled cells yielded about 25 microamperes/lumen , while his vacuum cells yielded about 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 , 1928 , there was a demonstration of large screen ( 18 inches square ) television at Schenectady . It was on 48 lines and used the Karolus light control . // Alexanderson stated that this was probably the first time that a picture of such size and quality had been projected . He credited flay Kell for working out the arrangement.1 ? On March 20 , 1928 , Ray D. Kell of General Fleetric applied for his first patent covering a color television system . It was a two color system in which the light from the scene was scanned by a disc with two sets of spirally arranged holes , in an interlaced scanning sequence . A disc with the two sectors provided the interlaced holes with light from one color to the first set of holes and light of the other color to the other set of ' holes . At the receiver , a similar disc with spirally interlaced holes had two lamps ( of ' different colors ) that illuminated the holes in sequence following the signals from the transmitter.rr On April 3 , 1928 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zworykin of Westinghouse . This was interference #54,922 . He lost another interference , #55,448 , to Dr. Zworykin on July 11 , 1928 . The loss of an interference in the United States Patent Office meant that certain claims had to be given up , the rest of the patent being allowed.r2 On April 17 , 1928 , Philo T. Farnsworth applied for a patent for electrical discharge apparatus . In this patent , he discussed how by applying a coaxial uniform , magnetic field , longitudinal to the path of the discharge around his tube , he was able to focus the electrical image to a sharp point . He claimed that applying this field caused two things to happen : first , the diffused spot focuses to a sharp image , and second , the plane of the deflection causes the alternating transverse field to rotate . He stated that an image formed in this fashion suffered from slight aberrations , the same as if focused by an ordinary lens . He described the paths of the electrons as being in helixes that depend on the electrical strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first patent covering this important application of " electron optics " to a television cathode ray tube.13 Philo Farnsworth applied for a patent for a synchronizing system on April 25 , 1928 . This patent described a shaded border around the picture to be transmitted , which by its nature would have a different frequency from that of the picture itself . It was proposed that a signal would consist of series of high frequencies ( 1500 cycles for horizontal scan ) followed by the random picture frequencies , which would be modulated by the low frequencies ( 15 cycles for vertical scan ) and transmitted . The receiver was to have means for selecting these separate frequencies . This patent showed for the first time in an application by Farnsworth a hot cathode Braun tube that was magnetically focused by a long coil . This long focus coil was used by Farnsworth for both his camera ( dissector ) tube and his picture ( receiver ) tube.14 On April 26 , 1928 , Ricardo Bruni of Italy applied for a television patent of an all-electrical method of television using what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the camera tube , a target was covered with selenium , which was scanned by a beam of electrons from a filament . The target was at an angle to the beam so that // the image from the scene and the elect ron beam impinged on the same side . The receiving Photoscope was also tilted to the beam , and it was planned that by synchronizing the two tubes , the pictures would be made visible by means of phosphorescent material and viewed through a lens.15 In April 1928 the Radio Corporation of America applied for a television station permit for a station to he operated by its Research and Test Department at Van Cortland ! Park in New York City . This laboratory , which had been under the direction of ' I ) r . Alfred N. Goldsmith since 1924 , was charged with the testing and evaluation of existing products and the planning of ' new ones . The television transmitter and scanning equipment were to he installed at 411 Fifth Avenue , the home of RCA Photophone , where convenient studio facilities were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theodore A. Smith , who was in charge of the new television engineering group . It was to use the 48-line , 16 frames/sec system developed by General Electric , who furnished all of the scanning equipment and who were also building some 48-line receivers . The transmitter was to operate on 2000 to 2100kc ( 142.8 meters ) . The Federal Radio Commission issued the call letters W2XBS for this facility . This appears to be the first permit ever issued in the United States for a television station.16 On May 5 , 1928 , C.F. Jenkins gave a demonstration of the projection of motion pictures by television to members of the Federal Radio Commission . His transmitting apparatus consisted of an ordinary 35mm film projector with the intermittent removed , a 48-hole scanning disc about 15 inches in diameter and a very powerful arc lamp . The film passed by the lenses at 15 frames/sec while the disc rotated at 900 rpm . The light from the arc went through the film and was registered on a photocell , which transmitted the picture information . A new television receiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollow drum some seven inches in diameter and about five inches wide . In the center of the drum was a hollow spindle with a thin wall . Within this drum were inset 48 short quartz rods , which were to conduct light to holes on the periphery of the drum . At the very center of the drum was a special neon tube with four targets facing upwards . With a revolving commutator , each of the four targets received its proper picture signal , which was transmitted by the quartz rods to a mirror sitting at an angle of 45 degrees . A magnifying lens was set up in front of the mirror to enlarge the picture . When the lens disc and the rods were properly aligned , a beam of light was transmitted across the mirror . It was claimed that silhouettes were clearly transmitted and the illusion of motion was excellent . This appears to be the first television device to use transluscent rods for the transmission of light to the screen . Jenkins announced that he intended to manufacture and sell " Radio-Movies " instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the regular broadcast receiver.17 There were two important demonstrations of television in 1928 . The // first was by Kenjiro Takayanagi of the Hamamatsu Higher Technical School in Japan . He gave a demonstration of his cathode ray television system before the Japanese Society of Electricity in May 1928 . He had im proved his system since April 1927 , and it was now capable of displaying moving images of hands and faces . He was transmitting 40 line pictures at 14 rev/sec . His article describing this system showed the first published pictures from the screen of a cathode ray tube . Takayanagi continued to improve his system and by the end of 1928 was transmitting pictures of " recognizable " quality ? not merely shadowgraphs , but pictures with halftones . Clearly he had the most ad vanced cathode ray system in the world at the time . He continued to // improve his system and by the end of 1928 was capable of transmitting pictures of " good " quality.18 On May 11 , 1928 , Dionys von Mihaly gave a denuuistration of televi-sion in Berlin which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his older machine , which it seems had never actually worked , and was now using the conventional Nipkow disc scanning , 30 lines at 10 frames/sec . Von Mihaly used an alkali-metal photocell at the trausinitter and a glow lamp similar to that of D. McFarlan Moore at the receiver . The demonstration consisted mainly of moving silhouettes and transparencies on a screen some 4 cm by 4 cm . This appears to be the first public demonstration of a working television system in Germany , and it was credited with creating great interest in the new medium.19 The Bell Telephone Laboratories had built a 36-inch scanning disc with larger scanning holes . It was fitted with a five-inch lens . A ( ' ase Thalofide photocell was used to translate the images into picture signals . On May 10 , 1928 , this disc was taken out of doors and set up on the roof of the Bell Laboratories Building . With it , they were able to transmit full-length pictures of men swinging tennis rackets and other such motions . This appears to be the first successful transmission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . The success of this experiment led 1 ) r . Ives to plan a demonstration for the public within four to six weeks.20 However , it was later claimed that the first demonstration of daylight television was given to the press in London on June 18 , 1928 , by John L. Baird . This is supposed to have occurred on the roof of Baird 's labora-tories in Long Acre and to have been sent to a room four floors below . In spite of the fact that there was no mention of this " demonstration " in either the London Times , N.Y . Times or Nature for 1928 , it was reported in Television in London by three authors.21 On May 22 , 1928 , Roy Bishop of the Farnsworth Laboratories wrote a letter to Mr. C.E. Tullar of the patent department of General Electric , trying to interest him in the Farnsworth television scheme . It was claimed that Farnsworth had given a private demonstration to Dr. James Cranston and Dr. L.F. Fuller of G.E . on March 1 , 1928 . It could n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the coils of the dissector tube . Also , according to Farnsworth 's records , the first " real " pictures from the Image Dissector did not occur until the week of May 7-13 , 1928 . It appears that Albert G. Davis , vice president of General Electric , did not think Mr. Farnsworth 's television scheme amounted to much , but he felt that Farnsworth had done some pretty scientific work with limited facilities . Therefore , General Electric indicated they would be happy to take Farnsworth on the staff with the understanding that they would buy whatever he had invented up to that time , but that " whatever he invents while in our employ comes to us under the regular engineering contract . " // It is known that Farnsworth 's financial backers had decided quite early that his television project be turned over to one of the large electric companies in anticipation of the enormous development costs involved.22 In June 1928 , Campbell Swinton published an article , " Television by Cathode Rays . " He claimed again that he had actually tried some experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and traversed by the electron beam . It produced no results when hooked up to a sensitive galvanometer . This was done with a cold cathode tube operating under high voltages and no means of amplification . He then went on to relate a short history of television , including the 1925 patents of Blake , Spooner and V.K. Zworkyin . He stated that Zworykin 's patent had a convention date of July 13 , 1923 , which was in error ? it was July 13 , 1925 . Campbell Swinton considered it a " very interesting " specification . He stated that cathode ray transmitters , though suggested and even patented , had not been exhibited or even claimed actually as having been made to function . At this time , Campbell Swinton was unaware that the only cathode ray transmitters in the world were being built and operated in San Francisco by Philo T. Farnsworth.23 On June 5 , 1928 , J.L. Baird of Television Ltd. applied for a patent on a color television system . It was for a sequential method of color television in which the scanning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of holes covered the whole image in an interlaced manner . There were light filters of blue , red and green covering the three sets of holes . By means of a commutator and slip rings , the signals were sent to a receiver with a disc similar to the transmitter . Here the signals were sent to appropriately colored lamps to recreate the original scene.24 Dr. Lewis R. Koller of the GE Research Laboratories presented a paper on June 7 , 1928 , to the Radio Division of the National Electrical Manufacturing Association ( NEMA ) . He explained the principles of photoelectric cells and stated that a cell made with a silver bulb coated with a thin layer of some material such as one of the alkali metals ( lithium , potassium , rubidium , cesium , etc. ) would be particularly photosensitive . He mentioned that a potassium cell did not see light the way the eye did as it was far more sensitive to blue and less to red light . Cesium photocells were most desirable for any work involving color . He mentioned the particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Koller described a cell with a silvered inside surface upon which a monatomic film of cesium was coated , with the cesium and silver acting as the cathode . Several curves of sensitivity were shown , the gas-filled tubes being higher than the pure vacuum tubes . A typical vacuum cell could have about 1 microampere sensitivity , while a similar gas-filled tube would have about 12-13 microamperes . It appears that the cesiummagnesium photocells of Dr. Zworykin were being tested by both Westinghouse and General Electric . The introduction of the cesium-silver photocell at this time made possible many advances in both television and // motion pictures . The more common potassium hydride photocell had neither the sensitivity nor the color response needed.25 On June 11 , 1928 , a Hungarian , Kolomon Tihany , applied for patents for complete electric television systems using a cathode ray transmitter and receiving tubes . Tihany described at least four varieties of photoelectric camera plates , each of which was quite novel and important . The first variation indicated a structure of metallic particles which were insulated from one another and had photoelectric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network , with the photoelectric coating being at certain intervals . The third showed an insulating diaphragm with thin layers of photoelectric coating and a thin continuous metallic layer ( 4 ) being earthed for increasing the capacity . The fourth called for the use of a glass plate with square alkali metal cells , having a reverse side of metallic coating to increase the capacity and a grid ( 41 ) in front of the carrier to collect the electrons released by action of the light . The electron beam im pinged on the alkali cells and was then reflected from the carrier plate to either a Faraday or Perrin cylinder . The last two variations were quite im portant as they showed means to store and intensify a charge . Tihany showed all of the elements necessary to produce a practical camera tube of the storage type , and it is claimed that he actually built some tubes to prove his thesis . However , there is no proof that they ever did work.26 The television apparatus of Ulises A. Sanabria was shown at a // a multi- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the " charge storage " principle at the receiving end . ' " In November 1927 C.F. Jenkins published an amide on " Radio Vision . " He gave the April television demonstration of ' the Bell laboratories great praise . He indicated that he was hard at work on the projection of motion pictures by radio , and he published photographs of his transmitting and receiving equipment.80 On December 31 , 1927 , August Karolus of the Telefunkcn Company applied for a patent combining a Kerr cell with a cathode ray tube . Ka roll 's stated that since the same pencil of cathode rays is to be influenced both for the purpose of picture composition and of brightness control , it must fail to fulfill the desired end for the following reason : since the means provided to control the light intensity of the fluorescent spot , that is , the strength of the electron current , alter at the same time as the velocity of the electrons , the deviation of the ray by electric or magnetic fields is made rather uncertain inasmuch as the deflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel of the light spot on the screen fails to be in exact synchronization with the transmitter . Karolus therefore suggested that the cathode ray tube send out a constant stream of electrons free from any deviations and that a Kerr cell be placed between the viewer and the screen , where it would be modulated by the picture signal . This he hoped would solve the problem.81 August Karolus shared the same feelings about cathode ray television as did Dr. Alexanderson and many of the leading television pioneers at this time : it promised the solution to the television problem , but fulfillment was just a visionary dream . Chapter 7 The Introduction of the Kinescope : 1928-1929 On January 7 , 1928 , Alexandre Dauvillier published a three-part paper on " La Television Electrique " in Revue General d'Electricite . The first part was the finest history of television since Korn and Glatzel 's 1911 book . Like most inventors , Dauvillier had compiled a long list of patents and papers on the history of television . He covered the work from Bain in 1848 to that of Schoultz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zworykin . The second part disclosed the efforts of the author to produce a practical television system based on the use of the cathode ray tube . The third part reported the author 's efforts at producing X-ray apparatus using television techniques as early as 1915.1 On January 9 , 1928 , Philo T. Farnsworth applied for his second patent application . This was for an improved dissector tube in that it indicated that the light from the scene impinged directly on the active lightsensitive surface . It also mentioned the use of secondary emission , which gives from five to twenty times as much current as can be obtained from photo-emission alone . The dissector tube , being an instantaneous device , was to be plagued by a lack of sensitivity and caused Farnsworth to devise many new secondary emission schemes to overcome this deficiency.2 On January 13 , 1928 , the General Electric Company gave a demonstration of television from its Research Laboratories station in Schenectady . The broadcast was under the supervision of Dr. Alexanderson . The picture was transmitted from 2XAF on 37.8 meters . The sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The picture was 48 lines at 16 frames/sec . A flying spot system was used at the studio , and it was claimed that the pictures could represent every detail in faces . The special receivers used the neon lamp of D. McFarlan Moore . The image was about 1 ? inches long and 1 inch wide , with a magnifying glass being used to bring the image size up to about 3 inches . It was claimed that three receivers in different parts of Schenectady were receiving pictures as good as those in the laboratory . They were located in the homes of Dr. Alexanderson and General Electric executives E.W. Allen and E.W. Rice , 108 // meeting of the Radio Manufacturers Association ( RMA ) in Chicago on June 13 , 1928 . This was the first time that television equipment was shown at a radio convention . The machine was built by A.J. Carter Company of Chicago . The transmitter had three spirals of holes of 15 each to produce a 45-line picture at 15 frames/sec.27 On June 22 , 1928 , Coryton E.C . Roberts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dissector type . It described a camera tube in which the entire electron stream was projected through an aperture in an // anode " A " in sequence to create picture signals . 11 showed various means for moving the electron stream across the aperture , and several interesting variations were described . It is known that Roberts later huilt several tubes of this kind but never did get any of them to work.2 ' On July 3 , 1928 , it was reported that John L. Ilaird gave the first demonstration of color television to the press and a party of scient is ' s . The transmitter used a scanning disc with three sets of spirals , each spiral being covered with a colored filter ( green , red and blue ) . A similar disc was used at the receiver , except that the color was provided by three special cells , neon for red , helium for blue and mercury for green . It was claimed that a demonstration of faces and flowers was vividly shown.29 On July 12 , 1928 , the Bell Telephone Laboratories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the roof of the Bell Telephone Laboratories in New York . It was claimed that the camera was portable enough to be taken anywhere for broadcasting . Scenes of a sparring match , a golf exhibit and other motions were demonstrated . Dr. Frank Gray operated the camera while Dr. Herbert E. Ives controlled the receiver.30 C.F. Jenkins applied for a patent on a cell persistence transmitter on July 16 , 1928 . In this patent , Jenkins described a means for storing the charges in a multitude of cells until they were discharged . He stated that as the light charged the cell to its full capacity , it could be discharged by a commutator , each cell being discharged in turn . If this current light translation occurred at the right time , to illuminate an elementary area of the transmitter , then an exact facsimile of the scene at the transmitting station would be reproduced at the receiving station . A multi-lamp receiver with some 2,304 bulbs was actually built to be operated by a commutator in a fashion similar to the Bell Telephone Labs large screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up of a multiplicity of photo cells was to be built . But no more was ever heard of it . This patent became the subject of interferences #62,727 and #67,440 with Dr. Zworykin of Westinghouse , which Jenkins lost.31 On July 26 , 1928 , Dr. Alexanderson made some tests of the General Electric television equipment in ordinary daylight . He first used the 24-line scanning disc mounted in a box . He could transmit simple figures of men boxing . Later , he used the 48-line transmitter , and he claimed that one could clearly see the skyline of the factories and smoke from the chimneys . Dr. Alexanderson presumed that the Bell Telephone Labs results were from some " radical improvements- in photoelectric cells . " 32 The Bell Telephone Labs never did reveal that they were using the Case Thalofide cell with such remarkable results . On August 8 , 1928 , the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company of East Pittsburgh demonstrated a system of " radio-movies " at their radio station KDKA in East Pittsburgh , Pa . The demonstration was under the auspices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave credit to Dr. Frank Conrad for bringing the device to its present state of perfection . The broadcast was sent two miles by land line to the // broadcasting station , and then two miles back to the receivers . The system operated on three frequencies : picture signals on 150 meters , sound on 63 meters and a special synchronisation signal on 90 meters . Dr. Conrad was transmitting a 60-line picture at 16 frames/sec . A special 35mm film projector was used with a 60-hole disc . The light from the film went to a cesium photocell and became the picture signal , which was converted into electrical impulses and broadcast . A 5000-cycle signal from a tuning fork was transniittecl on a special carrier wave . This was used at the receiver to synchronir.e the synchronous motors used there . At the receiver , a special " mercury arc " was to be used to provide the light for the picture . The image of the arc lamp was projected through the scanning disc and allowed the image to be projected onto some kind of screen or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still trying to equal the technical performance of the Bell Telephone Labs television system . It was to take the efforts of both General Electric and Westinghouse to do so . Since General Electric was obviously ahead with the transmission of " Radio Television " ( produced " live " directly from the studio ) , it remained for Westinghouse to perfect the technique of " Radio Motion Pictures " from 35mm film . It appears that the Westinghouse television project had been dormant since Zworykin 's failure in 1925/26 and that this effort had only recently been undertaken . Conspicuously missing from the Westinghouse television demonstration of August 8 , 1928 , was Dr. V.K. Zworykin . He had not been part of the Westinghouse television project under Dr. Conrad , having been engaged in research on photocells , film sound-recording and picturefacsimile apparatus . Dr. Zworykin was in Europe during the summer of 1928 inspecting various electrical laboratories . He visited Germany , Belgium , Hungary , Great Britain and France . It is known that he was particularly interested in the work being done in France by Dauvillier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom were engaged in cathode ray research . In Paris Zworykin visited the laboratories of Etablissements Belin and was shown all of their work in progress . He saw the Belin phototransmitter , which was very similar to a device Dr. Zworykin had been working on for Westinghouse . Here he met Gregory N. Ogloblinsky , chief engineer for Belin , as well as Fernand Holweck and Pierre Chevallier . He was shown a very crude cathode ray tube that used electrostatic means for focusing the beam . It appeared to be a two-piece glass tube that was continuously pumped to maintain a vacuum . It had a glowing cathode encased in a metal structure . Two disc anodes were used to focus and accelerate the beam . Only one set of deflection plates was built into the tube . The fluorescent screen appeared to be insulated from the rest of the tube by the glass structure . There was no connecting anode from the screen to the cathode that would have allowed the electron charge on the screen to be returned to the electron gun.34 // While the idea for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of Rogowski and Grosser ) or in America ( with the work of R.H. George in 1927/28 ) , it appears that Holweck and ( ' hevallier were among the first to build such a tube and actually get it to operate.35 Dr. Zworykin was quite elated with this disclosure and ret iirned to the United States sometime early in September 1928 with ( I ) a Ilolweck vacuum pump , ( 2 ) a Holweck demountable cathode ray tube , and ( 3 ) Gregory N. Ogloblinsky as a future Westinghouse recruit . ( ) globlinsky was soon to become a most valuable addition to Dr. Zworykin 's stalf. ' 6 Dr. Zworykin saw in electrostatic focus the answer he was seeking for a practical television picture tube . It would eliminate all of the problems associated with the gas-focused Western Electric tube of Johnson . Dr. Zworykin planned a permanently sealed , high vacuum tube with a pure electron discharge . In addition , he decided on separation of the function of beam modulation , deflection of the beam while at low electron velocities , and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high-voltage second anode in the form of a metallic coating on the inside of the glass bulb . This would provide a path for the electrons to return to the electron gun , thus preventing the screen from charging up . As is true of many great inventions , while all of these elements were in existence , it took Dr. Zworykin 's genius to put them together properly . This was Dr. Zworykin 's greatest triumph . Harley Iams , who had been working with Zworykin on facsimile at Westinghouse , was put to work on the television scanning deflection circuits sometime in November 1928 . It is claimed that Dr. Zworykin soon fabricated a crude tube from a Dewar flask in order to prove that it would work.37 In spite of the great promise of this new tube , Zworykin could not get Westinghouse to go ahead with his new idea . Therefore Sam Kintner , vice president of Westinghouse , suggested to Dr. Zworykin that he go to New York to visit David Sarnoff . This famous meeting ( of which the exact date is impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late in December 1928 or at the latest , January 1929 ) took place before Sarnoff left for Europe to participate in the German Reparations Conference from February 1 , 1929 , through June 1929 . David Sarnoff , who was then executive vice president of RCA , asked Dr. Zworykin how much it would cost to produce a workable television system . He was told that " it could be done in two years at a cost of some one hundred thousand dollars . " Zworykin informed Sarnoff that the " basic instrument was already operative but required extensive and expensive development . " ( There have been inferences that a crude camera tube was the instrument referred to by Zworykin , but it is known that Zworykin had no camera tube either being built or working at this time . He did have a crude picture tube built from the Dewar flask operating in his laboratory ) . David Sarnoff was convinced and had Westinghouse give Zworykin additional financing , staffing and equipment . In addition , an order was // soon given for a shipment of glass picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1928 , Francis C.P. Henroteau of Ottawa , Canada , applied for a United States television patent ( serial number 298,809 ) , which was never granted . This was basically concerned with a nonconducting photoelectric screen that was scanned and discharged by a beam of light . Henroteau sent copies of this application to C.F. Jenkins on August 16 , 1928 ; to I ) r . Lewis Koller of General Electric on August 30 , 1928 ; to Dr. Zworykin of Westinghouse on October 1 , 1928 ; and to Lee De Forest on December 14 , 1928 . This patent application was abandoned and a new one applied for in May 1929.39 It is claimed that John L. Baird actually demonstrated stereoscopic television at the Baird Laboratory in Long Acre on August 10 , 1928 . He used a scanning disc with two sets of spiral holes , each spiral having its own light source . Thus two sets of images were transmitted simultaneously . At the receiver , a similar disc with two sets of holes in spirals was set up with each hole staggered so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Thus an alternating image was presented to both eyes . An ordinary stereoscopic viewing device , consisting of two prisms , caused the images to be blended into a three-dimensional one . One observor claimed that " the illusion is very striking . " 4o On August 21 , 1928 , General Electric attempted the first outside remote broadcast using television cameras . This was to cover the acceptance speech of Governor Al Smith at the capitol in Albany for the Democratic nomination for the presidency . The " camera " was the new portable flying spot scanner of General Electric . It was a simple box in which the light from a 1000 watt bulb was projected through a 24-hole scanning disc . This box was accompanied by two tripod-mounted photoelectric cells , which were to pick up the reflected light from the subject and convert it into electrical signals . Technically , although it was a daylight pickup , the main source of light came from the camera , the same as used indoors with a flying spot scanner . The transmitter camera , which was operated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 miles away to where Aida Bedford was to monitor it and have it broadcast on Station WGY . According to Kell , the rehearsals went well , but the real event was spoiled when the enormous arc-lights of the newsreel cameras wiped out the picture.41 D.N . Sharma of Edinburgh applied for a patent for apparatus using cathode rays on August 24 , 1928 . The camera tube was very similar to Dauvillier 's 1925 patent ( see page 74 ) in that there was a special " composite plate " which was to reflect ' the light from the scene to a photocell . This special transparent or semitransparent plate was to be made of such material as zinc-sulphate with a trace of Thoria , etc . A cathode ray beam was to scan this special plate and as this plate received the light from the scene it would have a pattern of the scene impressed on it . As the // cathode beam scanned the rear of the plate , it was to render the plate more or less opaque ( depending on the amount of light t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varied its brightness , a photoelectric cell which faced it was to provide a varying signal , which became the picture signal . l'here is no record of this device ever having been built.42 On August 24 , 1928 , Philo Farnsworth of the Crocker-Bishop Research Laboratory of San Francisco gave a private demonstration of the Farnsworth television system to two members of the Pacific I elephone Company , Mr. J.E . Heller and L.A. Gary . They reported that the picture was of rather low intensity on a screen about 1.25 by 1.50 inches . Inrages were hard to identify , but motion was easily followed . They were inr pressed by the photoelectric transmitter tube ( the dissector ) and that all scanning was done electrically.43 This was followed by a demonstration to the press on September 3 , 1928 , and reported in the San Francisco Chronicle . This article featured the first photograph of an electric camera tube . Philo was shown holding a dissector in one hand and a cathode ray receiving tube in the other . In the background was one of his early " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of sending some 20 pictures/sec with about 8000 elements of light . ( This would be about a 50- or 60-line picture . ) The image was described at only 1.25 inches square with " a queer looking little image in bluish light now , that frequently smudges and blurs . " However , it was claimed that the basic principle had been achieved and that perfection was but a matter of engineering . It mentioned that the laboratories were at 202 Green Street in San Francisco and that the financial backers were W.W. Crocker and Roy N. Bishop . At this time , Philo Farnsworth had the only operating camera tubes in the world . Yet , to this day , Farnsworth 's pioneering efforts have gone relatively unknown and unappreciated.44 On August 31 , 1928 , there was a television demonstration given for the first time at the Berlin Radio Exhibition . The equipment of Dionys von Mihaly was operating and on display . There was also the television equipment of Dr. August Karolus of Telefunken . It was a device using a mirror drum and the Karolus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 by 10 centimeters . Only diapositives ( transparencies ) were transmitted , and it was claimed that the results were not as good as Baird 's television.45 The General Electric station in Schenectady , WGY , " telecast " the first television drama on September 11 , 1928 . This was a presentation of " The Queen 's Messenger " by J.H. Manners . The picture and sound were broadcast over separate channels . Three " cameras " were used , each containing a twelve-inch , 24-hole scanning disc driven by a small synchronous motor . Behind the disc was a 1000 watt lamp , the light of which was concentrated by a lens . Another lens on the outside of the box projected the light onto the subject . Each was mounted on wheels and had its own bank of photocells in a wooden box mounted on a tripod . Each cell was about seven // inches in diameter . ( These were the same as used in the Albany " remote " pickup . ) There was one camera for each of the two characters . The third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The director had a monitor screen to watch the progress of the program and controls for fading from one camera to another . The program was witnessed by a group of newspapermen and scientists gathered in one of the buildings of the General Electric Company , a short distance from the transmitter . It was claimed that the pictures were small , sometimes blurred and confused , not always in the center of the screen and hard on the eyes because of the flicker.46 One of these General Electric cameras was on display at the Radio World 's Fair held in New York City on September 21 , 1928 . It was part of the General Electric exhibit , which also included a demonstration of a large-screen television projector of Dr. Alexanderson . ( This was not the Alexanderson seven-beam device . ) It was claimed that this machine projected pictures some 12 by 12 inches onto a silver screen by a 5-inch projecting lens . There was also a television exhibit by the A.J. Carter Company , which had built the Ulisis Sanabria equipment . Its disc had three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was driven at 15 pictures/sec . This gave a 45-line picture . A third exhibit was given by the Daven Radio Corporation , which was using equipment with 48 holes on a 24-inch disc.47 On October 2 , 3 , and 4 , 1928 , General Electric attempted a series of long-distance transmissions of television signals over ordinary telephone lines . The test originated from a portable 24-line General Electric camera set up in a booth at the NBC studio at 711 Fifth Avenue in New York . The first test was from the NBC studio to the WGY studio in Schenectady . It was claimed that a face was recognizable , with very bad line reflections and four pronounced transients . A fan-shaped figure was received , which was very sharp but distorted due to the fact that the high frequencies were retarded more than the low frequencies . A second test was transmitted some 3000 miles from NBC in New York to Chicago , back to NBC , and finally to Schenectady . This was a total failure as no faces were recognizable and even the most simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Ray Kell and Merle Trainer proved that pictures sent over a long telephone line without phase correction were impractical.48 On October 4 , 1928 , Dr. Gillis Holst of Eindhoven , the Netherlands , applied for a patent on an early form of " image tube " for photographic recording . It was to be used for converting visible images to electrical images , both still and moving . In operation , the optical image was sent to a Opposite : Behind the scenes at the telecast of the first television drama : The Queen 's Messenger , September 11 , 1928 . Three cameras were used , with picture and sound broadcast separately . // plate , where it was converted into a charge pattern that was then sent en masse to an anode , which then emitted visible rays for viewing . The purpose was to provide means whereby the actinic effect of light rays may be materially increased.49 At this time in 1928 , there were about 12 stations actually broadcasting pictures in the United States at some time during the day or were about to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were using 24-hole scanning ; and one each were using 60 , 45 , and 36 holes . The number of pictures/sec varied from 7V to 21 . As a result , the Radio Manufacturers Association ( RMA ) formed a " Television Standards Committee " on October 9 , 1928 , to try to solve this problem . In order to slow the spread of television in the broadcast band , stations were allowed to broadcast only one hour per day and forbidden to do so between the hours of 6 and 11 P.M. The Federal Radio Commission restricted the hours of all still-picture transmission and television until January 1 , 1929 . After that date all television would be in a special band above 1500 kc.50 On October 10 , 1928 , John L. Baird applied for a patent for a television recorder . This patent was concerned with a self-contained player for gramophone records . This invention later was called Phonovision . On October 17 , 1928 , the BBC turned down the Baird Corporation 's request for a television station.51 G.W. Walton applied for a patent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strip on October 25 , 1928 . The strip could be recorded on film as a one-dimensional picture . It would be received and scanned on a similar film and reconverted to a conventional two-dimensional picture.52 The Bell Telephone Labs reported on October 29 , 1928 , that work was progressing on a 72-hole disc to replace the 50-hole disc which was then in use . It would require a bandwidth twice that of the older 50-hole system . It was demonstrated to Mr. F.B. Jewett on November 22 , 1928 . On October 31 , 1928 , Dr. Frank Gray of the Bell Telephone Labs reported on means for the recording of television images on film by the use of a strip source of light using a continuous motion of the film . The labs had previously considered means for the slow recording of television images on film that could be transmitted by telephone wires to theaters all over the country , thus making it possible to transmit newsreels within a few hours . It was hoped to send 200-line pictures at anywhere from 5 minutes to 12 minutes per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied for a patent , the first one to show the standard form of dissector that was to be used for the next several years . It had an added feature of dual apertures which were supposed to separate the high and low frequencies.54 John Hays Hammond , Jr. , applied for a patent for a system of television on December 6 , 1928 . Most of the patent dealt with the recording of events in order to present them under better conditions than would // otherwise be possible . " Figure 12 " of the patent shows his representation of a video recorder , the first American patent covering this important device.55 On December 12 , 1928 , M. Knoll , L. Schiff , and C. Stoerk of Berlin applied for a patent on a new cathode ray oscillograph . The patent described several cathode ray oscilloscopes as well as a complete television system . In addition , it mentioned the use of a new arrangement based on electrostatic effect for the focusing of the electron beam . This consisted of fixing at certain intervals , coaxially with and symmetrically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( e.g. , alternately perforated metal cylinders with small washers of large diameters ) , connected alternately with appropriate voltages . In this manner were produced divergent electric fields with stress acting obliquely to the direction of the beam in such a way as to compress the beam radially . If the voltage were sufficiently high , one single pair of electrodes might suffice to effect this concentration . The divergent fields could be obtained by various types of electrodes . If a controlling voltage were supplied to such a device , the intensity of the electrons in the beam , and thereby the intensity of the focal spot , could be varied without inertia . The patent also showed a figure containing a complete television system . Another figure showed a circuit for producing oscillations of linear voltage for use in television and picture telegraphy work , and another the wave-shape of the linear oscillation produced by such a connection . Waves were linear and followed a sawtooth pattern.56 On December 14 , 1928 , Ray Kell of General Electric reported on the results he had obtained using a standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to put a grid into a tube but had finally given that up . Instead , he had added a vacuum tube into the circuit feeding the television signal to the shield to vary the brilliance of the spot . Kell had devised a linear scanning circuit to feed currents of 480 cycles and 20 cycles to the plates in the tube . By making contact with the scanning disc at 480 times/sec he claimed that the electron beam followed very closely the spot at the transmitter . Kell claimed that with this device , he had " been able to produce pictures of fair quality . " 57 Fritz Schroter of Telefunken GmbH in Berlin applied for a patent describing a television recording device on December 23 , 1928 . It used a photochemical process in which a glow tube ( using a filament ) impressed its light onto a strip of photographic emulsion in such a manner as to create a visible image . It was an accurate system in that it had six rotating glow lamps that scanned across the emulsion . There was a slit between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines . Another variation showed the use of the emulsion between two electric poles to produce the electrical impulses ( six positive poles passing a negative pole ) to create a picture on the top side of the paper , which became immediately visible.58 // Philo T. Farnsworth received nationwide publicity in January 1929 . On February 15 , 1929 , he hired Harry L. Lubcke , a young electrical engineer from the University of California . Lubcke 's main project was to help Farnsworth develop a completely electric scanning generator . Farnsworth had been using 500-cycle motor generators to generate his sine-wave scanning currents . The use of sine-wave scanning created several problems ; it produced double images , since it was impossible to keep the two-half cycles in exact phase , and it produced " shaded " pictures as a result of the variable speed with which it scanned the picture . Farnsworth then turned to tuning forks as a means of synchronization and finally to vacuum tubes to produce his scanning pulses . By July of 1929 , Farnsworth and Lubcke had developed an electric scanning generator that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scan line . This gave Philo Farnsworth the first allelectric television system in the wot " Td- . He now had in his laboratory an allelectric camera device ( the dissector tube ) , a magnetically focused high vacuum cathode ray viewing tube , and a vacuum tube scanning and pulse generator . There were absolutely no moving parts in the system . " In January 1929 , the terms for the purchase of the Victor Talking Machine Company of Camden , New Jersey , by the Radio Corporation of America were set . The purchase price was some $154 million , which was paid to the banking house of Speligman and Speyer . It appears that in October 1927 the RCA board of directors , at the request of David . Sarnoff , had recommended that RCA be provided with a separate manufacturing unit to which the General Electric Company and Westinghouse Electric would transfer elements of their radio facilities and staff . A second committee in April 1928 recommended this consolidation in principle but put a ceiling of $25 million on RCA production.60 However , by 1929 the purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey ( that Sarnoff had long coveted ) but also principal interest in the Victor Talking Machine Company of Japan and the Gramophone Company Ltd. of Great Britain . It also included a well-organized system of distributors and dealers . The Gramophone Company Ltd. had made an agreement with the Marconi Company to acquire the business and rights of the Marconiphone Company in the field of home entertainment . Therefore David Sarnoff became a director of the Gramophone Company Ltd. in March 1929 . One immediate result was that the Gramophone Company started to receive the RCA patents and began a limited research program into television.61 The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company , as the RCA licensee in Great Britain , was also receiving the RCA patents and registering them in Marconi 's name . The General Electric Company was assigning their patents to the British Thomson-Houston Company , while Westinghouse Electric was either keeping them under their own name or in the name of Metropolitan Vickers . David Sarnoff had very little interest in the talking machine . He made // immediate plans to begin the manufacture of radio sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Camden during the first part of 1930 . This included the important work that Dr. Zworykin and his staff were now doing at Westinghouse in East Pittsburgh.62 Actual work on the new Zworykin television system began on February 1 , 1929 , with the arrival of the first shipment of glass bulbs from the Corning Glass Company . As I ) r . Zworykin did not have a camera tube working at the time , he decided to use a standard Simplex movie projector that had had its intermittent removed as a source of picture signals . An oscillating mirror was to scan the motion picture frame . A relay lens system focused the beam onto one part of the photocell . It was planned to use sine-wave scanning for the horizontal scan as it simplified the scanning process with both the oscillating mirror and the scanning coils being fed by the same simple sine-wave generator . Vertical scan was a linear process , however , with a toothed wheel driven by the film to indicate the start of each frame . A contact on the wheel would discharge a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of one motion picture frame . This process was described in a patent applied for by Dr. Zworykin on March 26 , 1929 . While the patent went into great detail about the transmission system using a film projector there was very little said about the receiving tube . The patent was mainly concerned with the synchronization of the film frames . Details were given only of a control grid being connected to the negative end of the battery and an alternating potential representing the picture signal . There was no hint given of a revolutionary new picture tube.63 As promised by David Sarnoff , Dr. Zworykin had several engineers assigned to his project . Among them was Harley Iams , who had started the project in November 1928 . John Batchelor arrived in April 1929 , Arthur Vance in May 1929 , Gregory N. Ogloblinsky in July 1929 and Randall Ballard in September 1929 . W.D . Wright was the optical engineer for the group . Batchelor and A.J. Harcher were building the picture tubes . Video amplifiers , deflection circuits and high voltage supplies were designed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Skypzak . The radio receiver design was by Ballard . The general layout of the receivers was designed by Harley lams and a student engineer by the name of Pepper . ( Because of ill health , Iams left the project in December 1929 , as did W.D . Wright , who had to return to England because of family problems . ) The first satisfactory picture tube was produced by the middle of April 1929 . The film projector was completely assembled by the end of April . The development of a suitable electrical circuit was undertaken , and on May 10 , 1929 , the first demonstration was given of a movie film over three separate pairs of wires . Finally a circuit for the transmission of moving pictures over a radio channel was developed using a single radio channel for both picture signals and synchronization.64 // Dr. Frank Gray and John R. Hofele of the Bell Telephone Labs applied for patents on February 2 , 1929 , which were important as they were the first to reveal the spatial distribution of the video signal . I hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internals , leaving huge gaps with relatively little information.65 On February 3 , 1929 , it was reported that the General I : leetr ie ( ' ompany had transmitted both the picture and voice of the noted lilni director D.W. Griffith from their studios in Schenectady to Los Angeles by means of their short wave station W2XAF operating on 31.48 meters . The voice was carried by station 2XO on 22.5 meters . Although the audio was fine for the entire fifteen minutes , the picture lasted only a few minutes . This seems to be the first nationwide telecast of both sight and sound.6 On February 11 , 1929 , Frank Gray revealed that the Bell Telephone Labs had developed equipment suitable for the " real-time " recording of television images on 35mm motion picture film . By the use of a special quartz , capillary , mercury lamp , and a special rotating disc with a series of slots , it was possible to form a beam of light in successive parallel lines across a piece of continuously moving film . Dr. Gray claimed that they were actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these recordings have survived . ) " Thus the art of " television film recording " was born in the Bell Labs some time early in February of 1929 . This apparatus was considered to be part of the Bell Telephone Labs scheme for the projection of television images on a large screen almost simultaneously with their reception.67 On February 11 , 1929 , Leon Nemirovsky of Paris applied for a patent for a secret transmission system using a rotating magnetic wheel with a multitude of recording and reproducing coils.68 Jean Thibaud presented an article on February 27 , 1929 , which showed the effect of the longitudinal magnetic current on a slow ( lowvoltage ) electron beam . This article mentioned the research on " electron optics " ( this seems to be the first time this term was actually used in the literature ) and the ( 1927 ) work of Hans Busch and others . There were figures showing the effects of the longitudinal magnetic field on the beam either to concentrate or magnify it . The spiral path of the beam under the influence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the similarity between the action of a magnetic field to that of a lens to light.69 The First Annual Exhibition of the Television Society was held on March 5 , 1929 , at the Engineers Club in London . Historical devices of Mr. Llewelen B. Atkinson were shown . These were apparatuses presumably devised some 47 years before ( 1882 ) . The apparatuses consisted of mirror wheels at both transmitter and receiver . In order to avoid electrical reproduction , the light from the scene went to a point representing a selenium cell and back to the transmitter . A crude form of light modulator was also displayed . Capt . Wilson of the Baird Television company showed a complete shadowgraph transmitter and receiver . A Mr. Troutbeck of // Standard Telephones and Cables showed a cathode ray oscilloscope loaned from his company.70 Baird Television Ltd. gave another demonstration to the BBC in March 1929 in an effort to get facilit ies granted . The generally poor quality of the Baird system in London had led the Postmaster General to make a statement concerning participation with the Baird Company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievement " but con-sidered that the system had not reached a sufficiently advanced stage to warrant its occupying a place in the broadcasting of programs . He had no objection , however , to Baird using a BBC station for this purpose outside of broadcasting hours.71 Having had very little luck with the British Post Office , Baird decided to take his equipment to Germany . It seems that the secretary of state and high commissioner of broadcasting , Dr. Hans Bredow , and two assistants had been in London in December 1928 and had witnessed a successful demonstration of the Baird system and had invited Baird to bring his equipment to Berlin and use their Witzleben transmitter . Baird did so , and he used the Berlin transmitter from May 15 , 1929 , to June 13 , 1929 , when he apparently discontinued its use as a result of many difficulties . At this time , von Mihaly also had permission to use the Berlin transmitter for his " Tele-Cinema " and did not fare as well as Baird did . But Baird 's statements to the press that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmission than you are " was not lost on the BBC . With great reluctance , the Post Office agreed to allow Baird to use their facilities at radio station 2L0 with signals from Baird 's Long Acre laboratory using the 30-line , 12 ? frame/sec system . The most important result of Baird 's trip to Berlin was the formation of Fernseh A.G. on June 11 , 1929 . This was formed with Baird Television , Zeiss Ikon , Robert Bosch , and Loewe Radio and registered on July 3 , 1929.72 The installation of television equipment by the Van Cortlandt Park Laboratory at 411 Fifth Avenue was completed by mid-March 1929 . RCA had decided to go with the Westinghouse standard of 60 lines at 20 frames/sec ( instead of General Electric 's 48 lines at 16 frames/sec ) and on April 13 , 1929 , had presented a paper calling for some tentative standard-ization of the television signal.73 On April 14 , 1929 , Dr. Alfred Goldsmith reported on the progress be-ing made by RCA 's station 2-XBS , indicating that some form of television receiving device would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper report so distressed Gen. J.G. Harbord , president of RCA , that he wrote a letter of admonishment to Dr. Goldsmith , telling him that from now on all of his publicity releases would have to be cleared first with RCA . This action of course was a result of RCA 's and Sarnoff 's policy not to interfere with the highly successful radio operation of the National Broadcasting Company.74 R.H. Thun of Germany applied for a British patent on May 18 , 1929 , // for a method of variable scanning or variable velocity in which the brightness of the portion of the picture being scanned was varied by the speed of the scanning device while its brightness remained constant.75 On May 25 , 1929 , J.W. Horton of Electrical Research Products applied for a patent for an intermediate film system ( similar to their September 14 , 1927 patent ) except that this was for a color intermediate film system . It showed three sets of photocells at the transmitter and three sets of light valves at the receiver . At this time , Bell Labs were finishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed to he in operation by June 10 , 1929.76 On May 29 , 1929 , F.C.P. Henroteau of Ottawa , Canada , applied for a patent for a television process in which a nonconducting photoelectric screen had an image formed on it . A beam of light passed through a filter and a slit through an aperture in a rotating disc , causing an emission of electrons . The beam was cut off by this disc and the mosaic was charged by the light from the scene . A shutter then cut off the view and the cathode was scanned from two rotating discs which caused regular displacement of the beam . It was planned that the intensity of the beam should he greater than the light from the scene . A British patent was allowed on October 6 , 1930 , but although the American patent was also allowed , Henroteau 's attorneys decided to withdraw the patent but not abandon it.77 The French Television Society was formed on May 30 , 1929 . The first president was Edouard Belin . Among the charter members were Edouard Branley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valensi.78 On June 27 , 1929 , the Bell Telephone Laboratories gave a demonstration of color television . It was claimed that the same light sources , scanning disc and synchronizing systems as the monochrome system were used . New were the type and arrangement of the photoelectric cells and the type and arrangements of neon and argon lamps at the receiving end . A new type of photoelectric cell was revealed that used sodium rather than potassium . The Bell Telephone Labs chose sodium as it was easier to work with than either rubidium or cesium , and they claimed that it had response into the deep red . These cells were developed by A.R . Olpin and G.R. Stilwell . This was a simultaneous color system , the first one in television history . The three primary colors were displayed at the same time , rather than in sequence as Baird had done in his earlier color demonstration . Three sets of photocells were used , each covered with a set of colored filters ( orange-red for red , yellow-green for green , and greenish-blue for blue ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight with green filters , and two with blue filters ? was used according to the relative sensitivity of the cells . Three sets of amplifiers were used to transmit the signals . A mirror arrangement was set up with three lights ? two argon , one with a blue filter and one with a green filter ? and a neon lamp for red . // A standard 16-inch scanning disc was used , and it was claimed that when properly adjusted , an image was seen in natural colors with the general appearance of a small colored movie screen . fhe system used the 50-hole disc rotating at 18 rev/sec . The scene was viewed through a pair of semitransparent mirrors set on an angle of 45 degrees . The Bell Telephone Labs claimed that the colored images produced by this method were " quite striking in appearance , in spite of the rather low bright Hess and small size characteristic of the present stage of development . " By June 1929 , the RCA television station W2XBS was now telecasting some two hours daily ( 7 to 9 P.M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was reported in July that not only was " conservative RCA " broadcast i ng television on a regular schedule but there were rumors of " impending RCA television receivers . " 80 All was not well at RCA when David Sarnoff returned from Europe in June 1929 . A new plan involving the Victor Company had been formulated that perpetuated the old system of having three sets of engineers and managers , each going his own way in the Camden plant . Sarnoff ohjected strenuously , and offered to resign if the plan was not changed to have a single , united management under his control . On October 4 , 1929 , Sarnoff 's plan was adopted , and on December 26 , 1929 , a new entity , RCA Victor Company , was incorporated . RCA owned 50 percent of the company , General Electric owned 30 percent , and Westinghouse , 20 percent . However , this new plan was soon to run into two difficulties . The first was the onset of a deepening depression in the United States , and the second was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Justice.S1 On June 27 , 1929 , T.A . Smith of the Radio Corporation applied for a patent for a method of interlacing ( staggered manner so that successive lines are reproduced out of sequence ) . It was claimed that this arrangement reduced or eliminated picture flicker at the receiving station.82 V.K. Zworykin of Westinghouse applied for a second patent on his new system on July 5 , 1929 . This was the same basic patent as the March 26 , 1929 , application with the addition of separate synchronizing pulses , one for each oscillation of the mirror and one pulse for the end of each complete frame . It was planned to send all of the signals on a single radio wavelength.83 This was successfully accomplished , and pictures by radio were demonstrated to a group of General Electric and RCA engineers , including Dr. Alfred Goldsmith , on August 17 , 1929 . Management was so pleased that they asked for nothing to be changed except to package the parts into six home receivers to be sold by Christmas , 1929.84 On July 19 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patent for a television system using a film projector similar to Dr. Zworykin 's except that it used a Nipkow disc and a mask to limit the beam to the picture portion of the frame . However , the use of a Nipkow disc predicated the need for a linear scan with quick return . This was similar to the film projector // systems of C.F. Jenkins , Dr. Ives and Dr. Gray of the Bell Telephone Labs , and Dr. Conrad of Weatinghouse.85 Dr. Zworykin , having had considerable success with his new picture tube , now decided to develop a cathode ray tube for the transmitter as well . With the knowledge he had gained in the development of his picture tube , i.e. , the use of electrostatic means for sharp focus and the use of a pure electron discharge in a vacuum , as well as the newly developed techniques for using cesium as the photoelectric substance , Dr. Zworykin started ex perimenting with the demountable Holweck cathode ray oscillograph pur chased from Belin in France . Gregory N. Ogloblinsky had arrived at Westinghouse from Paris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a study of its performance and proper alterations , a transmitter was assembled for 12-line pictures . " From all indications , it was constructed using the Holweck demountable tube into which was inserted a crude mosaic consisting of several rows of rivets or pins placed within an insulated target . The side of the plugs facing the lens was photosensitized with a layer of cesium . The beam was focused upon the rear of the target . Some form of screen was used to collect the discharged electrons and provide the picture signal . According to the report , " the result proved to be quite promising . A rough picture was actually transmitted across the room using cathode ray // tubes for both transmitter and receiver . " It also mentions that an interesting principle ( charge storage ? ) was found and verified experimentally . " The solution of the direct vision problem is thus considerably advanced and may be the next point of attack in the practical development of television . " No more work was done on the camera tube until the move to Camden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only inventors working on cathode ray tubes using electrostatic focus at this time . In January 1929 Roscoe H. George of the Engineering Experiment Station , Purdue University , Lafayette , Indiana , described a new type of hot cathode oscillograph . The important feature of the new oscillograph tube was the " new " electrostatic method of focusing the beam . It was a metallic tube that was continuously pumped . The oscillograph would operate at any beam potential from 500 to 20,000 volts . Dr. George had been working on an oscilloscope since 1927 , and it was claimed that a portable machine of this type had been in operation since August 27 , 1928 . The circuitry included automatic devices for recording lightning surges that start the beam some to ? microseconds after the surge voltage begins to rise from zero . George indicated that the focusing of ' the electron beam had always been the most difficult problem in cathode ray design , since the positive ion method of Johnson does not function well at beam potentials in excess of 200 volts and the magnetic method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The oscilloscope was run from a 110-volt line and the vacuum produced by means of a rotary oil pump . On September 14 , 1929 , Roscoe H. George applied for a patent on this device . The patent related to the principle of electrostatic focus , which was quite important , but nowhere was there mentioned means for modulating the beam . So it appears that George was mainly concerned with a fixed high brightness cathode ray oscillograph tube as a means for recording certain high speed electrical phenomena.87 The Berlin Radio Exhibition was held in August of 1929 . The German Post Office sponsored the television exhibit . It furnished a 30-line , 12 ? frame signal from a telecinema transmitter . On display was the von Mihaly apparatus , which received the Post Office transmission on a special receiver . Its quality was considered quite good . Dr. August Karolus of Telefunken had two sets of receivers on display , one that received the Post Office transmissions and a separate one that operated on 48 lines . The receivers used his special Kerr cell , which projected a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 48-line receiver had the best picture at the show . For the first time , Fernseh A.G. had an exhibit which included receivers of the Baird design , the only difference being that the scanning direction was horizontal rather than vertical . It was indicated that some production of ' receivers was contemplated at the time.88 On August 20 , 1929 , the Baird Television Development Company had // transmitted their first talking pictures using a Mechau projector . Up to this time , Baird had shown very little interest in transmitting motion picture film . It was claimed that voices were very clear and that the pictures as good as could be expected at this state of the art . The Baird Television Company had also sent much experimental equipment to New York City and gave a demonstration of both sight and sound on September 2 , 1929 . This was sent by wire from the Paramount Building to a laboratory at Forty-l " ifth Street.89 On September 30 , 1929 , the first experimental broadcast took place from the Baird st udio in l , ong Acre through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame system . Only the picture was telecast since only one transmitter was available . It was claimed that " fairly clear images " were transmitted . This was quite a victory for the Baird Television Company " Pierre E.L . Chevallier applied for a French patent for a cathode ray tube incorporating electrostatic focus on October 25 , 1929 . Basically , this patent related to the reduction of the section of the electron beam , or what may be characterized as focusing of the electron beam . Chevallier described means of focusing the beam by means of difference of potentials to create an electrostatic field to focus the projected electrons to a sharply defined point . The patent showed two versions : first , a completely metallic tube that was continuously pumped , and second , a glass tube that was to have its interior metallized . However , the same mode of operation was claimed for both . The proper ratio of voltages for focusing the beam was from to 1/2 of the potential applied to the tube wall and the cathode . The modulating voltage was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patent referred to certain researches involving the use of a cathode ray oscillograph . It is almost certain that Chevallier , working with Holweck , had a crude version of this tube operating in the Belin Laboratory in Paris when Dr. Zworykin visited it in the summer of 1928 . How advanced it was , or how well it operated , has never been ascertained . There is no evidence that Belin ever tried to develop it further in spite of its potential . A patent was filed and was issued in France on February 16 , 1931 . On June 16 , 1931 , the RCA patent department became involved in the American patent application , processed it and gave it the title " Kinescope. " 91 Another researcher , Manfred von Ardenne of Berlin , delivered a manuscript on October 2 , 1929 , describing a new cathode ray tube for photographic recording . Von Ardenne stated that this tube provided extreme brightness for instantaneous exposure . He claimed this brightness was due to ( 1 ) the use of a calcium tungstate ( CaWO2 ) screen which possessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) the use of electrostatic concentration of the beam using a Wehnelt cylinder with negative bias with a trace of a rare gas to prevent divergence of the ray after leaving the anode , and ( 3 ) the use of potentials of up to 4500 volts . // Since this tube still relied on the gas to focus the beam , it was closely related to the Johnson Western Electric tube . It was claimed to have a sensitivity of 1.5 millimeters with an anode voltage of 400 volts . This tube was later ( 1931 ) to be placed on the market by E. Leyboldt Nachfolger A.G. of Bayenthal , Cologne , Germany , and was to be used quite extensively by the British at that time in their early research in radar detection . It was very useful for oscillographic purposes that did not demand modulation of the beam.92 On November 16 , 1929 , V.K. Zworykin of the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company applied for a patent for a vacuum tube . Dr. Zworykin claimed that up till now it had been substantially impossible to focus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of the intensity of the ray . Dr. Zworykin stated that he now proposed a cathode ray tube improved in the following ways : ( l ) capable of operating under acceleration potentials of thousands of volts ; ( 2 ) not // requiring continuous pumping , ( 3 ) having electrodes simple in construc tion and having small volume , ( 4 ) focusing the ray totally unaffected by the control potentials , ( 5 ) having a spot that is well defined at all points of deflection on the screen , ( 6 ) having an acceleration potential so large in respect to the intensity controls that the deflection of the heanr is not in fluenced by said control potentials and is the same for all intensities , and finally ( 7 ) having a tube wherein the electrons are accelerated i rr t wo stages , one at low potential and another at high potential , and wherein deflection of the electrons occurs between the two said stages . Dr. Zworykin described a tube of high vacuum , containing no gas . 11 had a second accelerating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t lie inside of the large portion of the tube . All of the deflection devices , one magnetic for horizontal deflection , and the other electrostatic for vertical deflection , were external to the tube . It was suggested that the screen could have a long persistence phosphor in order to decrease the number of ' frames/sec . It could have a cooling fan , or be provided with a cooling jacket if the beam had to remain in one position too long . The patent was granted with six claims , Claim Four relating to the electrostatic field effec tive to focus the ray onto the screen.93 On November 18 , 1929 , Dr. Zworykin delivered a paper describing his new picture tube to the Institute of Radio Engineers at Rochester , New York . First he described the transmitting equipment . An ordinary 35mm film projector with its intermittent removed used a vibrating mirror to focus the light from the film onto a photoelectric cell . A scanning speed of some 480 cycles was used . This was sine-wave scanning , but Dr. Zworykin claimed that the nonuniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent to the eye , so no precautions were used . A description of the receiver , with its picture tube or " Kinescope " as it was now called , was given . It had been found that three sets of signals ( picture , horizontally scanning frequency , and framing impulse ) could be combined into one channel . At the receiver , the output of the radio receiver was amplified and divided into three parts : the synchronizing fre quency , the framing impulses , and the picture frequencies . The synch ronizing frequency was applied to the deflection coils , the framing impulse and the picture signal to the control electrode of the Kinescope . The same voltage that modulated the control grid was impressed upon a bandpass filter , which was tuned to the frequency of the AC voltage used for the framing impulses . The output of this filter was amplified , rectified and used to unbias a discharging triode , which was normally biased to zero plate current and which took its plate voltage from the condenser that pro vided the vertical scanning voltage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ( 1 ) the // picture was green ( rather than red as with a neon light source ) ; ( 2 ) it was visible to a large number of people ; ( 3 ) there were no moving parts ; ( 4 ) the framing of the picture was automatic ; and ( 5 ) it was brilliant enough to be seen in a moderately lighted room . There have been several reports that Zworykin gave a " demonstration " of the Kinescope on November 18 , 1929 , at Rochester , New York . But careful investigation shows that only a paper was read . ( Too many times the press was careless in announcing a so-called " demonstration " when only a lecture was given . ) While Westinghouse did have several working receivers at the time , there is no evidence that any were on display at the meeting.94 // Seven receivers had been built by November 1929 , with one of them going into Dr. Zworykin 's home four miles from K I ) K A for experimentation . It was reported that KDKA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1929 , using the Conrad television system . Dr. Zworykin used the Westinghouse television transmitter late at night ( between 2 and 6 P.M. ) some three times a week to telecast quite satisfactory pictures . This was on the 150 and 90 meter wavelength . Dr. Zworykin claimed that film of 60-line definition ( at 12 frames/sec ) was quite well received at his home . This appears to be the first reception of television by radio to an all-electric receiver , with absolutely no moving parts . In addition , at this time , a second film transmitter was built for transmitting both pictures and sound . A special film was prepared for use with the 12 pictures/sec frequency , and it was claimed that sound pictures were transmitted across a laboratory room.95 However , the disclosure of the Kinescope changed the history of television for all time . For Dr. Zworykin had produced a simple hut ingenious picture tube which made it possible to have a practical receiver in the home of the viewer , a device which the average person could operate , that required absolutely no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost normal lighting conditions . Zworykin 's tube was the most important single technical advancement ever made in the history of television . Yet it was greeted with skepticism by most of the " experts " working in television at the time . They knew only too well of the limitations of the " standard " cathode ray tubes available and found it hard to believe that Dr. Zworykin had actually accomplished a breakthrough . Some of this can be blamed on the secrecy that quickly descended over the Kinescope : It was reported that even as Dr. Zworykin was giving his speech , someone from the Westinghouse Patent department was giving him signals not to go on with his lecture . There were absolutely no public demonstrations of this device until May 1932 , and most of the descriptions of its operation came from reporters , none of whom had ever seen the tube in operation.96 On November 20 , 1929 , W.J. Hitchcock of General Electric applied for a patent for camera tubes having targets and a minimum of capacity to their surroundings and well insulated from each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plurality of small conducting sections or spots mounted on vitreous supports.97 The Baird Company gave a demonstration of its television equipment in New York City on December 20 , 1929 , featuring Mayor Jimmy Walker . It featured " live " telecasts of both picture and sound . It was claimed that " the image was recognizable and the music in perfect step with the picture . " 98 i-In December 1929 the magazine Radio published a photograph of a Farnsworth television image . It was claimed that the original was approximately 3 ? inches square and consisted of 20,000 elements . This appears to be the first photograph published of an image produced by an all-electric television system with no moving parts.99 // Also in December 1929 , Isaac Shoenberg left the Marconiphone division of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company after 15 years and joined Columbia Graphaphone Company as the manager of patents at the request of Louis Sterling.10 ? In France almost all work on television was at a standstill . It appears that the loss of Gregory Oglohlinsky to Westinghouse signaled the temporary cessation of French research into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of Belin and Holweck . Dauvillier had turned to the field of cosmic physics . The only experimentation being done was by one Rene Barthelemy of the Compagnie pour la Fabrication des Compteurs et Materiel d'Usines a Gaz of Montrouge , who was concentrating on the synchronization of mechnical television scanning systems ) 0 ' In the United States , the important work on cathode ray transmitters was being done by Dr. Zworykin at Westinghouse in Pittsburgh and Philo Farnsworth in San Francisco . The only other work on cathode ray receivers was that of Frank Gray of the Bell Telephone Labs and Kenjiro Takayanagi in Japan . It appeared that at this time , television was finally going to emerge from the laboratory and take its place in the entertainment industry . But the end of 1929 found the United States and Europe about to enter a deep economic depression . This depression was to have a profound effect on the fledgling television industry . Chapter 8 Back to the Laboratory : 1930-1932 On January 3 , 1930 , David Sarnoff became president of the Radio Corporation of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to be concentrated in the new facilities at Camden , New Jersey . In addition , General Electric was to turn over its Harrison Tube Plant and Westinghouse Electric its Lamp Works at Indianapolis to RCA . Dr. W.R.G. Baker of General Electric became chief engineer of RCA Victor . Two engineering groups were set up at Camden under L.W . Chubb . There was an Advanced Development Division , headed by Albert F. Murray . Under Murray were ( a ) Radio Receivers , under George Beers ; ( b ) Acoustics , under Dr. Irving Wolf ; and ( c ) Television , under Dr. V.K. Zworykin . Albert Murray seems to be the only executive coming from outside the General Electric/Westinghouse Electric empire . He had been assistant chief engineer of the Wireless Specialty Company of Boston , owned by John Hayes Hammond , Jr. , who was one of the large RCA stockholders.2 . There was also a General Research Group under the direction of Elmer W. Engstrom , who came from RCA Photophone . The Technical and Test Department , under Dr. Alfred N. Goldsmith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifth Avenue . In January 1930 John Baird 's television experiments over the Brookman 's Park transmitter were then extended to two half-hours per week for night transmission . In March 1930 , two wavelengths were assigned to the Baird system so that both sound and picture could be transmitted together . This transmission started on April 1 , 1930 . Vision was on 356.3 meters and sound on 261.3 meters.3 Also in January 1930 , it was announced that Jenkins Television was producing television sets . Jenkins had two transmitters in operation : W3XK in Washington , D.C. , and W2CXR in Jersey City . On January 14 , 1930 , Jenkins applied for a patent which proposed to use his rotary drum-type scanner as a means of flying spot scanning . He claimed that the light pipes would conduct the entire amount of light to the subject without material loss of intensity.4 General Electric made two long-distance tests of television images 147 // from Schenectady on February 18 , 1930 . The first was from Schenectady to Australia , relaying the image back to Schenectady , where it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schenectady to California and back . The image was it simple rectangle drawn on white paper . The received image afternated from single to multiple images and at times was quite sharp . The California test gave better results.s Alan Archibald Campbell Swinton died on February 19 , 1930.6 He was never to know that at this time camera tubes very similar to the ones he described in 1911 were being built in the RCA Laboratories by V.K. Zworykin in ( ' amdcn , New Jersey . It is claimed that Dr. Zworykin started work on two - sided camcra tubes as soon as he moved into the new laboratories in Camdcn . On March 3 , 1930 , P.T. Farnsworth applied for a patent covering an electron multiplier . This was to be done by modulating an electron stream , and using a pair of opposed surfaces to liberate electrons by secondary emission . The final electron flow was a function of the potential through which the electrons fell between impacts , and the number of impacts. ? Hans Hatzinger of Frankfort am Main , Germany , applied for a patent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was in the form of a multitude of mirrors arranged in a spiral along an axis . This seems to be the first mirror wheel patent . It was presumed that this device would produce brighter pictures than either the Nipkow disc or mirror drum.8 At this time , there were several reports on the new picture tube of Dr. Zworykin . In the United States , an article in Radio-Craft in February 1930 was followed by a similar article in Radio News . In Europe , however , an early article by W.G.W. Mitchell in Television gave no real information as to its performance and was very misleading . For instance , there was nothing said of its two anodes , the use of electro-static focus , or the fact that it was gas-free . Another article by Dr. Neuberger in Fernsehen ( the first German television journal ) was along the same lines . Thus the European reports did nothing to indicate the tremendous breakthrough that had been accomplished.9 However , reports of the new Zworykin tube seemed to have two immediate results . On March 26 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported on the work that had been done with a " new " Bell oscillograph , which was of the high vacuum type ( no gas ) , used magnetic focus and had a lead in front of the hot filament in order to control the beam . Gray reported that this new tube , " gives television images equal in quality to those on the disk and of the same order of brightness . " 10 In Japan , Kenjiro Takayanagi also started to build high vacuum cathode ray tubes . He filed two patents on March 28 , 1930 , for tubes of this type . It is reported that by May 1930 he was able to demonstrate bright and distinct pictures on tubes some 15 and 30 cm in diameter . " April 1 , 1930 , was the official date of the changeover of all television research from the General Electric Company , Westinghouse Electric &; Manufacturing Company , and the Test and Development Division of Van // Courtlandt Park to the new laboratories of RCA in Camden , New Jersey.l2 At this time , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gramophone Company , RCA extended 1ui imitation to A.W . Whitaker , who was in charge of Advanced Development ( Research ) , to come to the United States and see the work being done by ( icnerd I-:ICCt ric , Westinghouse and RCA in Camden , New Jersey . On April 2 , 1930 , he witnessed Zworykin 's television system and reported that , " his high voltage cathode ray tube presented a 5 inch image and was so bright t hat it could be viewed in a brightly lighted room . " This seems to be the first report on the new Zworykin Kinescope.13 On April 3 , 1930 , Dietrich Prinz of Berlin applied for a patent for means of synchronizing the horizontal and vertical scanning frequencies in a television system . They were locked together through frequency multiplication and demultiplication devices . As far as can be determined , this is the first patent covering this important feature . Although it was assigned to Telefunken , it became part of the RCA patent structure due to the relationship between Telefunken and RCA.14 The Television Society in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College on April 9 , 1930 . There were exhibits by Capt . Wilson , C.P. Garside , T.C.M. Lance and C.F.C. Roberts . It appears that Roberts had a display of his " dissector " tubes , none of which were working . " 15 On April 9 , 1930 , the Bell Telephone Laboratories gave their first demonstration of a new two-way television system . There was an increase in the number of scanning lines from 50 to 72 , which gave twice the image detail . It was claimed that a bandwidth of some 40,000 cycles was necessary in order to transmit this amount of detail . Synchronization was by means of a 1275-cycle alternating current , controlling motors rotating at 18 frames/see . The flying spot featured a blue color to which the eye was relatively insensitive . The system was in operation between the Bell Laboratory Building and the main offices of the American Telephone &; Telegraph Company in New York City . A demonstration of this new system called the " Ikonophone " was reported later in May 1930.16 Early in April 1930 an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratories of Philo T. Farnsworth in San Francisco . The early effects of the deepening recession were being felt , and some of the stockholders of the Farnsworth Television Laboratories were anxious to sell out and were actively seeking new ownership . The firm of Carroll W. Knowles Company had acquired an option to buy the stock of Farnsworth Television Laboratories and had sent out an invitation to RCA to inspect the laboratories and its patents . It appears that this was done without Philo Farnsworth 's knowledge . lowcvcr , when Farnsworth found out that Dr. Zworykin was to come , it is reported that he was delighted and prepared to show him all he // had accomplished . Farnsworth knew of Dr. Zworykin 's work ( from the many patent interferences between them ) and had very high regard for him . As a result , he welcomed Dr. Zworykin as a future ally or at least as a source of much-needed financing . Also , Farnsworth felt that Dr. Zworykin would understand his language and would have proper appreciation of what he had attained . On April 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent three days at the Green Street laboratory . He was gracious in his praise of Farnsworth 's results and seemed tremendously impressed with what he saw . He was shown in detail all that had been accomplished . Sitting at Farnsworth 's desk on the lirst day after his arrival , in the presence of Jesse McCarger ( presiden ( of Television Laboratories ) , Donald Lippincott ( patent attorney ) and George Everson ( financial backer ) , he paid him high tribute by picking up the dissector tube and saying , " This is a beautiful instrument , I wish that I might have invented it . " This of course , pleased Philo Farnsworth very much . Later , Cliff Gardner showed Dr. Zworykin the success that he had had in sealing an optically clear disk of Pyrex glass onto the end of the dissector tube . Dr. Zworykin had been assured at both Westinghouse and RCA that such a seal could not be made . So it was arranged to have Gardner show Dr. Zworykin how he accomplished the sealing process . Dr. Zworykin seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straightforward in design , it was a remarkable camera tube . With sufficient light ( from film or slides ) it was an excellent transmitter . It had no " shading " problems ( uneven distribution of the electrical charges making up the picture ) , delivered a clear distinct picture , was inherently a direct-coupled device with a constant ( black ) reference level and could deliver all of the background information . However , Dr. Zworykin was not at all impressed with Farnsworth 's cathode ray picture tube , which could produce only small , dim pictures compared to his newly developed Kinescope . On his way home , it is reported that Dr. Zworykin stopped in Los Angeles and wired Dr. E. Wilson of Westinghouse ( they had developed the cesium-magnesium photo cell together ) and requested him to make up several dissectors for future experimentation . Of course , this is standard practice ? for one laboratory to build or construct devices of another laboratory in order to verify or challenge its findings . It is known that several were built and operated . ( One has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the RCA Patent Department . ) While Farnsworth was still using some form of potassium hydride as his photoelectric element for his tubes , it appears that Dr. Wilson was able to use the new cesium surfaces that had been developed in both the General Electric and Westinghouse laboratories and as a result produced much more sensitive tubes.17 Dr. Zworykin wrote a report on the Farnsworth system , which must have raised much curiosity about it . Dr. Zworykin obviously could not // admit that the dissector tube at this time was much superior to the crude , two-sided experimental camera tubes he was building in the RCA Laboratories . However , he could comment that his new dcvrlopnwntal Kinescope was far superior to the Farnsworth picture tube , or " O " Cillite , " as it was to be known . The report is not available , and all we can find is the reaction From Dr. Alexanderson , who stated , " Farnsworth had evidently dune sonic very clever work , but I do n't think that television is going to develop along these lines . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service as a competitor to the Radio Corporation group by settling this provided he has financial backing . If he should be right , the Radio Corporation ran afford to pay more for his patent than we can justify now . " Of course , it is known that Dr. Alexanderson was not in favor of any cathode ray system ( including Dr. Zworykin 's ) at this timer$ At any rate , RCA then sent Albert Murray and T. Goldsborough ( the RCA patent attorney ) to San Francisco to again investigate the Farnsworth patent applications . One thing is certain : the advanced look at the Farnsworth system certainly spurred Dr. Zworykin to improve his new television system . Upon his return , Dr. Zworykin continued his efl'orts to build a practical camera tube . On May 1 , 1930 , Zworykin filed for his first patent on a camera tube since July 13 , 1925 . This was for a very different type of'tvuosided tube . It was thought that the great advantage of a two-sided tube was that the target plate would insulate the beam from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the gas from the oxide would poison the photo surfaces and render the tube inoperable . The tube could be made in two forms , either " linear " or " planar . " The " linear " form was to be used for scanning motion picture film . It would be composed of a single line of cells . As the beam repeatedly scanned this row of cells , the upward movement of the film compensated for any need of vertical scanning by the electron beam . Tubes of this type were the easiest to construct ; thus the first camera tubes built in early 1930 were in this form . The full screen or " planar " device was to be of such size as to capture the entire view . This meant as many rows of cells as there were scanning lines . This kind of device was very difficult to build . It is known that several of the " linear " camera tubes were built to prove that the principle was sound . The patent application showed a camera tube that resembled Dr. Zworykin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had a second anode for focus and acceleration . The target was two-sided , consisting of a multitude of pins or rivets which penetrated the supporting plate . One side of the target was to be photosensitized with cesium oxide , and the other side was to be a common plate that was connected through a resistance to an amplifier . In front of the target was a plate or screen that furnished the polarizing voltage and was connected to the other side of the // resistance through a battery . This plate furnished the picture signal . A cathode ray beam from an electron gun was to scan the rear of the plate systematically . Each of the rivets or pins was to act as a single photoelectric cell , as they were isolated from each other . They were to form an electrostatic pattern according to t he amount of light each cell was subjected to . They were to be charged continuously and only discharged when the beam struck the rear of the plate . Unfortunately , the problems of building uniform and hlenrish-free targets of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they operated , but not very well.They certainly were not as good as the Dr. Wilson Image Dissectors they were testing at the time . In fact , Dr. Zworykin wrote Harley Iams on June 20 , 1930 , that " Ogloblinsky got very nice results with the transmitting tube , which is a modified Farnsworth type . " He continued , " The sensitivity is quite high , and I hope to get a direct vision pretty soon . " Of course , direct vision was Dr. Zworykin 's dream ? that is , to be able to pick up a " live " image direct from a scene by means of its own reflected light.20 On May 5 , 1930 , Philo Farnsworth applied for two patents ( one with Harry Lubcke ) covering the production of electrical scanning generators which produced slope-wave ( sawtooth ) currents to control the scanning of the electron beam , means for extinguishing the beam during the return portion of the cycle and use of an extinguishing impulse to synchronize both transmitter and receiver . According to the records , generators of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laboratory as early as July 1929 . These appear to be the first sawtooth generators not using pulses from a disc or photocell , but generated electrically . The patent also included means for suppression of the DC component ( the black level ) at the transmitter and reestablishing it at the receiver.21 On May 20 , 1930 , Dr. Frank Gray of the Bell Telephone Labs made a summary of the various means for electrically scanning a picture . It appears that Dr. Gray had been interested in electrical scanning since April 29 , 1929 , but this was the first time that an interest in this approach was seriously considered . Dr. Gray mentioned scanning by a moving beam of radiation as well as a cathode ray beam . He suggested the use of the photosensitivity of insulators and/or high resistance plates , and the interactions of two different types of radiation on a light-sensitive material . He stated that " storage of photoelectric charges over an image cycle presents the possibility of greatly increasing television signals and perhaps transmitting television signals under ordinary conditions of illumination . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrated in Camden under the direction of Dr. Zworykin , the General Electric group led by Dr. Alexanderson decided to publicize their research efforts with a demonstration of large screen television . This took place on May 22 , 1930 , in Schenectady , New York . // Dr. Alexanderson 's group had developed it large screen television projector using the Kerr cell originally devised by Ur . August Karolus of Telefunken . This equipment was moved to Proctor 's I heater ( RKO ) in Schenectady . With the assistance of Ray Kell and Merrill Rainer , they were able to present television images on a six-foot-SLIUM e u ? reen . the picture was about half as bright as that of the regular motion picture with good shading up to the limits of illumination . The projector was a standard 175-ampere motion picture machine . The scene was picked up in the television studio at Schenectady by a regular 48-hole disc using the " flying spot " method . The picture was transmitted by a 140-meter transmitter to an antenna on top oft he theater . The 48-line , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swaying of the image . However , the large size of the screen proved startling . The picture was accompanied by the sound from a pair of loudspeakers transmitted on 92 meters . The program consisted of an announcement by Mr. Trainer , a series of vaudeville acts , and it Imate , an orchestra number with the conductor directing from the television studio a mile away.23 At this time , the unification of RCA was underway . In essence Westinghouse Electric and the General Electric Company were reduced to partners , having large stock ownership and powerful representation on the board of directors of RCA . But David Sarnotrs desire for complete independence came unexpectedly with the aid of the United States government . On May 13 , 1930 , it was announced that the Department of Justice had filed an antitrust suit against RCA , the General Electric Company , Westinghouse Electric , and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company . It wanted the new agreement scrapped , the patent pool disassembled and all exclusive contracts ( both home and abroad ) made nonexclusive ; further , the Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the production and sales of radio and other electrical equipment . Coming at this time , as the depression was deepening , could have been fatal to the Radio Corporation of America . For RCA to agree to the terms of divestment and the changes in the patent structure would have been a disaster . But largely through the efforts of David Sarnoff , a satisfactory agreement was reached with the Justice Department.24 On June 14 , 1930 , Philo Farnsworth applied for his first patent on a cathode ray receiving tube . This was to be known as the " Oscillite . " It was to be used for both oscillographic and television use . Farnsworth planned to focus the electron beam by means of a long magnetic coil that extended the length of the tube . The tube had a concentration electrode that caused an electrostatic field to accelerate the beam in such a manner that it passed through an aperture , although slightly convergent . Then it was planned to focus the beam sharply as it struck the screen by means of the long magnetic coil.25 // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image amplifier on June 14 , 1930 . He described an advaiwed dissector tube in which he formed an electron image , dissected its iniape into steps of elementary width and applied the strips of said elect roil image charge to control the intensity distribution of space current ol ' clongated cross-section to form successive partial images of greater intcwits. ' c , Starting in June 1930 , Philo Farnsworth made several attempts at transmitting his television pictures by both wire and radio . H e t ri cd t o send television signals of 300 kc bandwidth on a 1000 kc carrier over an ord i nary telephone line . He also tried to transmit signals on a four-meter radio link . Neither test was very successful , with the radio signal showing . seven multiple reflections . However , this was the first transmission of an all electric television signal by radio . Due to costs , no further tests were made after August 1930.2 ' On July 7 , 1930 , the Technical and Test Laboratory of RCA turned over the operation of the RCA television transmitter at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air on July 30 , 1930 , and at this time the test laboratory under Dr. Alfred Goldsmith was dissolved . " There was much dissension at the new Zworykin Television Research Laboratory in Camden , New Jersey . It seems that the two groups , c iencral Electric and Westinghouse , could not agree as to which path to follow . " I'hc Westinghouse Group was for electric television . The General Electric peo ple still insisted that mechanical scanning had merit . It was decided to evaluate the two systems at a test house in Coll ingswood , New Jersey . This evaluation took place around July 15 , 1930 . According to Bucher , Zworykin 's group had developed a complete tele casting system based on 80-line scanning and the use of the Zworykin cathode ray picture tube for reproduction . There was a television film transmitter using a Nipkow disc . A mechanical impulse generator was used to keep the transmitter and receivers in synchronization . Elmer Bucher also claimed that there was a " camera " developed for studio pickups . But there is no record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setup was the " camera " referred to by Bucher . ( The best information available is that the Zworykin Group was using the two-sided experimental camera tubes for slides and film only . These tubes simply did not have enough sensitivity for " live " pickups at this time . Of course , they did have the Wilson " image dissector , " which was operating quite well , but it is known that it also did not have enough sensitivity to be used in a studio . There was to be no studio camera for at least another year . ) The General Electric Group relied on its flying spot scanner and the projection system of Alexanderson/Karolus . Both systems were shown and evaluated , and the cathode ray system of Dr. Zworykin was shown to be far superior . Yet the General Electric // people insisted that their method had merit . It was finally decided to allocate 90 percent of the funds to the Zworykin television system and 10 percent to the General Electric system . It was decided to abandon mechanical scanning at the transmitter as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of perfection . The results obtained with his equipment were so superior to those of any other or prior system that some enthusiastic observers declared the system ready for public service . But the conclusion was overly optimistic ; a larger and more detailed picture was deemed essential for a telecasting service to the home.29 On July 14 , 1930 , Baird Television gave its first demonstration of a large screen television system . It was some five by two feet . Baird had returned to his very first patent and developed a large screen consisting of 2100 tiny metal filament lamps set in a cubicle covered with ground glass . Each of the 2100 lamps was connected to a commutator , which contacted each lamp in its proper time sequence . A 30-line picture was projected some 12 ' /z times/sec . It was claimed that the inertia in each lamp helped to create an image that had greater brilliance and less flicker . This screen was demonstrated on July 14 , at Long Acre , as Baird Television presented its first television play , " The Man with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large screen and claimed that " the image greatly and rapidly varied . " This large screen was made portable and was first shown at the London Coliseum on July 28 , 1930 . It was then transported to Berlin where it was demonstrated at the Scala Theatre on the week of September 18 , 1930 . It was also shown at the Olympia Cinema in Paris and the R6da Kvarn Cinema in Stockholm. - ' ( ) // On July 17 , 1930 , V.K. Zworykin applied for his first television patent for RCA Victor . It was a slightly advanced version of his May I , 1930 , patent for Westinghouse Electric . It was for a camera t uhe Veit h a target structure consisting of a plurality of conducting plugs having a light-sensitive head element extending through insulating apertures . Iwo f'me mesh screens enclosed the conducting plugs . Since each of these clemews formed a condenser , they were continuously charged by the electron cmission from the light-sensitive plug . Much was made of the fact that the condensers continually charged until they were discharged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6400 elements in evenly spaced parallel rows of 80 evenly spaced elements . The rays from the cathode ray beam reach the positive screen at a velocity corresponding to the potential difference between this screen and the cathode . Part of these electrons are absorbed by the screen and pass or leak to ground by way of a battery and a conductor . Those electrons which pass through the openings of the screen strike directly a spot on the exposed side of the composite anode , the remainder striking the surface portion of an electrode immediately adjacent to or above this anode . The target worked in the following manner . When all of the lightsensitive elements are uncharged , the same number of electrons strike each of the surface portions of the electrode for all positions of the cathode ray beam with respect to the composite anode . This causes a direct current to flow through the resistance by way of the battery and ground to cathode . But when the value of the charges on the conducting plugs varies , a corresponding current from the electrode goes through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other methods of fabricating the mesh cathode and the composite anode were mentioned . Several of these tubes were built and operated . On July 30 , 1930 , Major Edward Howard Armstrong filed for the first of three new patents on a system of wide-band frequency modulation ( FM ) . Armstrong had invented four of radio 's most important developments : the regenerative or feedback circuit in 1914 , the heterodyne in 1917-18 , the super-regenerative circuit in 1921 and the super-heterodyne in 1922 . On August 5 , 1930 , Telehor Akt-Ges of Berlin , Germany , applied for a patent for television receivers . It was to use a rotating mirror system in which the mirrors were in strips corresponding to the width of the picture . The mirrors mounted on a spindle , which was rotated by a phonic drum . Since there were more strips than picture lines , it was planned to secure a phase relationship by moving the mirror system axially . Although a similar mirror system could be used for scanning at the transmitter , it did not appear in the specification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patent for a new type of light valve on August 15 , 1930 . Basically , the invention called for the use of a local light source of constant intensity which was modulated by the action of a special screen in its path . The screen was to be constructed with a series ol'apertures and cooperating plates so that as // it was struck by the modulated cathode ray beam , it would vary the amount of light transmitted by the screen to develop a picture . This appears to be the first patent covering the use of a cathode ray beam to modulate a special screen to produce large screen television images.34 The 1930 Berlin Radio Exhihit ion was held during the week of August 21-31 . It featured the Fernseh A.6. transmitter built for the German Post Office . It also showed a standard tcicvisor developed by Fernseh using the patents of the Baird Company . I'hc only other equipment was that of the Telehor Company which was featuring receivers , both finished and in kit form . Telefunkcn did not exhibit the apparatus of Dr. Karolus at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the General Electric Company applied for a patent covering the generation of pulses at the end of each scanning line , which would substantially correct any imbalance in light and dark portions of the line . By this time , Alda Bedford , Ray Kell , Merrill Trainer and several other General Electric engineers had been transferred from General Electric to RCA Victor and were working under W.A. ( Doc ) Tolson in a new division called the Development Television Test Section.36 On October 4 , 1930 , Dr. Herbert E. Ives of the Bell Telephone Laboratories applied for a patent covering the use of the new Kodacolor lenticular film for a color television system . In this process , the film was covered with a series of ridges ( lenticules ) in such a manner as to separate the three colors by means of an objective lens provided with a plurality of different contiguous color filters . This created a group of striations that represented the various colors . This was done with ordinary black and white emulsion . To get color on playback , another special lens similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now reproduced the picture in full color . In the television system the light was divided by mirrors and sent to three photocells . Their output became the color television signal.37 Dr. Ives delivered a paper on this system for the transmission of images in color from motion picture film on October 7 , 1930 . He mentioned the relative ease of transmitting images from motion picture film , while admitting that the practical simultaneity of an event was lost when film was used . However , the advantages to be gained over the material transportation of film especially in the home were considerable . But considering the cost of Technicolor film , he proposed the use of the relatively new Kodacolor film in which the images were produced in black and white on lenticular film . This produced a triple linear mosaic which represented the three colors . By projecting this film through a lens with three apertures , covered by red , green , and blue filters ( similar to those used in recording ) , the picture would be reproduced in full color.38 On October 20 , 1930 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nonvisual television recording system . The inventor called it the Stixograph process . The recording was to be made by continuously impressing // the photographic exposure on a moving recording surface . It could be made photographically on a film strip , in spiral form on a disc , or on a cylinder in the form of a helix . The record material could be either opaque or transparent . Playback seems to be with the use of a suitable optical system as described in a previous patent . This seems to be the first nonvisual television recording process using photography similar to a motion picture sound track.39 E. Hudec of Berlin applied for a patent covering an electric scanning generator in which synchronizing pulses were sent at the end of each line on November 11 , 1930 . The patent also covered an electric scanning generator for cathode ray television scanning.ao In November 1930 Philo Farnsworth described his all-electric television system in detail for the first time . It consisted of an " Image Dissector " tube , which converted light into electrical impulses ; a wide-band amplifier flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sawtooth form , which also turned off the beam on its return path ; and a picture tube , which was a modified Braun oscillograph or " Oscillite " ( also called the Oscillight ) which was magnetically focused and deflected . The horizontal frequency was some 3000 cycles , and the vertical frequency was 15 cycles , so that 200-line images were produced . The dissectors had cathodes coated with potassium hydride , which
