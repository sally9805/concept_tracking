A word about the crime and the punishment : Assuming Ronald Radosh and Joyce Milton are right , toward the end of World War II an Army sergeant ' who was working as a machinist at Los Alamos came home one day.and at his brother , **30;2736;TOOLONG his sister 's knowledge ) drew , a-pict ) . ir ' : ? from memory that had something to do with the atomic super-weapon than was secretly in production , and gave it to a man he had never seen before .

The picture did n't tell our Russian allies anythini'thex had n't already-been told infar greater detail ' by the physicist Klaus. ? uchs , - but it may have had corroborative value : As punishment ? the sergeant was sentenced to fifteen years in prison , the go-between was sentenced to thirty years ( as was a classmate of the brother-in-law who was vaguely ' said to.fmow something about it ) , The brother-in-law andsister were sentenced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on June 19 , 1953 , they were executed at Sing Sing prison in Ossining , New York . The interesting question is , How come ? What was it in our history , our political culture , our circumstances that led the judge , the higher courts , politiCians at every level on up to the ' President , and the mainstream press to endorse a punishment that today looks not merely disproportionate but vastly worse than the alleged crime itself ? ' At the time , , these " atom spies , " as Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were called in the headlines , were said to have " stolen the secret of the atom ( Continued From Front Cover ) bomb " and given it to the Red enemy , causing casualties " exceeding 50,000 " - ( Judge Irving R. Kaufman , on sentencing ) or " tens of millions " ( President Eisenhower , on the day they were executed ) . But who was counting ? The ' early 1950s consensus was that a coven of City College subversives , acting on behalf of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , triggered the Korean War and put the free world itself in jeopardy . Now , however , it is generally agreed that there was no single " secret " of the A-bomb , certainly not one that could be transmitted from memory by a high school graduate ; that what the Russians ' own scientists had n't already figured out they had learned from Klaus Fuchs , the world-renowned physicist who had passed them technical information even as he worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos . While it may be against one or another law , sharing such marginal information as the Rosenbergs were convicted of having conspired to procure , with a wartime ally on one 's own initiative , hardly seems the " crime of the century " ? certainly it did not deserve the death penalty . Throughout our history , as historian David Brion Davis has observed , " there has been a striking discrepancy between the pitiful weakness and incompetence of most conspirators and the willingness of many Americans to believe that a powerful , monolithic and virtually infallible organization was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of The Rivals , Buckley 's speech rhythms could do wonders with Mrs. Malaprop 's linguistic pratfalls .

Just Buckley , in a ring of conservative showmen , uttering fatuities to the rhythm of tambo and bones . throw the Republic . " Were the exaggerated fears generated by the Rosenberg case merely one more instance of a pattern that has persisted from the time of the first subversive plots of the British crown against our free institutions ? Or were cold war myths , fears and suspicions sui generic ? What role , if any , did the Holocaust play in setting the stage for what was , after all , largely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their counsel were all Jews demonstrating their patriotism before a - gentile audience ) ? What were the psychological mechanisms by which so many dedicated civil servants , politicians and statesmen persuaded themselves that these unhappy two had jeopardized our survival ? What were the enduring consequences of this tragic episode to our people , our polity , our spirit ? These are among the important questions raised by Radosh and Milton 's The Rosenberg File : A Search for the Truth ( Holt , Rinehart &; Winston , 608 pp. , $22.50 ) . Unfortunately , the authors chose not to grapple with them . Instead they preferred to embark upOn what they call " a search for the truth " ? to sort out not the meaning but the facts , to say once and for all that the Rosenbergs and their co-defendant , Morton Sobell , were or were not guilty as charged . That 's too bad . The sociology of countersubversion is a critical and much misunderstood subject , and no case would seem better suited to exploring it than this cold war spy drama which captured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tandem with the Hiss case and the Smith Act prosecutions that preceded it . But it is not for me to tell Radosh and Milton what book they should , have written , and searching for the truth is never an ignoble or irrelevant enterprise . Besides , in a case that has been beleaguered by ideologues , if indeed Radosh and Milton had " suCctimbed to the facts , " as Walter Goodman put it in The New York Times Book Review some weeks ago , that in itself would be a considerable service . That , of course , is exactly what they claim to have done  --  to have looked at the facts as independent scholars without ideological blinders . Their claim seems enhanced by a conclusion that appears to split the ideological differ , enee : The Rosenbergs were gifilty of low-level espionage ; the state was guilty of political murder . Their credibility is not hurt by their backgrounds , particularly that of Radosh , a sometime Nation contributor who as a high school student participated in the Union Square deathwatch vigil for the doomed couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading member of the Committee to Re-Open the Rosenberg Case . In fact , it was n't until his friend James Weinstein , editor of In These Times , told him a story that his " suspicions as , a trained historian were aroused , " and he embarked on thiS study ( first with former Ramparts editor Sol Stern , who seems to have conducted most of the interviews , and after he dropped out , - with journalist JOyce Milton ) . Among their key findings : ? Julius Rosenberg organized and ran at least one " spy ring , " which consisted primarily of City College alums who engaged in industrial espionage and passed on the fruits ; of their labors to the Soviet Union . ? The key witnesses against Julius , ? Divid Greenglass ( Ethel 's brother ) and Harry Gold , the go-between , an odd character with a history of fantasizing  --  told the truth at the trial . ? Although there was no secret of the A-bomb , the sketch of the lens mold passed on by Greenglass to Gold , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - knew about the theft of the A-bomb information and was probably complicit . ? The evidence against Ethel was at best weak , but the government 's strategy was to use her as a " lever " to get Julius to talk . - ? The behind-the-scenes conduct of virtually everyone involved , from the judge to the prosecutors to the general counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union to the F.B.I . to the Rosenbergs ' own lawyer to the leaders of the American Communist Party , was improper , immoral , , corrupt and /or inept , thereby depriving the Rosenbergs of a fair trial and of fair post-trial consideration of their appeal for clemency. - Lots of questions are left hanging . Thirty-thousand F.B.I . documents remain unreleased and critical portions have been censored from the rest . Using the same mass of papers as Radosh and Milton , Walter Schneir and Miriam Schneir came to a diametrically opposite conclusion on the question of the Rosen-bergs ' guilt in their updated Invitation to an Inquest* ( Pantheon , 522 pp. , $8.95 ) , and have taken 3,500-word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Books ( " ' Invitation to an Inquest ' : An Exchange , " September 29 ) . Nonetheless , the mainstream press has hailed The Rosenberg File as establishing the " basic truth " about the case . As Prof. Alan M. Dershowitz of the Harvard Law School wrote on the front page of The New York Times Book Review , " All future discussions about the Rosenberg case , at least those that are reasonable , will have to begin with the historical fact that Julius Rosenberg was guilty of espionage . " Dershowitz 's point is worth ponder-. , ing not only because of his essay 's influence  --  that comes with the venue  --  but because of his ostentatiously non ' ideological stance . Like Radosh and Milton , he virtuously claims to be more interested in the truth than in its ideological consequences . And his test of truth relies on evidence , sources , methodology . By those criteria he finds that the evidence that Julius played a central role in " a Soviet spy ring " emerges " from so many independent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " This focus on cross-confirmation , documentation and the quality of sources is apropos . A reviewer can not , after all , replicate the original research  --  collate hundreds of thousands of pages of government documents , ferret out pseudonymous missing persons such as the Greenglasses , gain access to restricted archives . One can , however , spot-check available sources , analyze a random sample of the files , weigh the logic of the argument and make sure it does n't venture beyond the evidence . This would seem a critical task to undertake before concluding , as did , for example , Prof. Alan Brinkley of Harvard , in The Washington Post , that " rather than use the Rosenbergs to settle old ideological scores they have risen above the passions surrounding the case and produced a work of remarkable balance and restraint . " In fact , Radosh and Milton are not . ' always quite so scrupulous as Dershowitz , Brinkley and others suggest . Sometimes they accept F.B.I . files at face value ; sometimes they make dubious use of their sources ; sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those practices entirely random . It is true that Radosh and Milton noisily reject the shibboleths of those they call extremists on both sides ; it is also true that they are as merciless on the prosecutors as they are on the defendants and their defenders . Nevertheless , two biases seriously skew their research . First , there is their resistance to unresolvabie ambiguity ; second , despite their condemnation of cold war injustice , they maintain the dubidiu-s1 cold war assumptiOns of liberaPtaiiiii-i communism , especially in the way they link the American Communist Party to the Soviet espionage apparatus . These biases assert themselves particularly in their handling of F.B.I . files . Frequently , the authors check the raw data in the files against other documents or the memories of participants . But frequently they do not . Consider their discussion of the F.B.I . ' s first interview with Al Sarant , who was , according to Radosh and Milton , a key member of the Rosenberg spy ring and who was recently reported to have died in the Soviet Union in 1975 . Sarant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his talks with Julius Rosenberg he " had had the distinct feeling that he was being ' sounded out ' for espionage work . But , ' he told the agents with some . satisfaction , ' I did not bite . ' " Whe* one refers to the chapter notes one finds a reference to a " summary of interviews " with Sarant conducted by the F.B.I . So , one asks , how do Radosh and Milton know that this is indeed what Sarant told the F.B.I . " with satisfaction " ? Perhaps , Sarant told the agents that he had been " sounded out " or perhaps the agents asked him whether he had ever been sounded out , and he said , " Well , if I was sounded out , I did n't bite . " - The point is not that Sarant did or did n't say what he is reported to have said , but that , given J. Edgar Hoover 's famous obsession with the internal Red menace , it is naive  --  and too convenient  --  to take F.B.I . files @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " unbiased " facts of an interview , but just as often he may write up a file to make a record , to justify further investigation , to impress a superior , to make himself look good , tilIate Hoover or tell him what he ' wits to hear , to open or close a case . fn the absence of independent corroboration , it is a significant lapse to rely on an agent 's version of a conversation about or with a security suspect as anything more than a clue to what actually was said . The Radosh-Milton record on sources is no more reassuring . I do not refer here to the eleven ( out of forty-two ) " interviewees " who , although acknowledged in the book , claim they were never interviewed . There my sympathy lies with the authors . Definitions of " interview " differ , and the memory of one-time interviewees is notoriously short , especially about projects that extend over a period of years and for which they may have developed a distaste , My suspicion is that Radosh and Milton listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom could be expected to be hostile to their conclusions , in an attempt to give their research an air of across - theboardism that it did n't quite deserve . At most , that 's a venial sin . More serious is their misleading treatment of the three former Communist Party officials quoted to the effect that they knew of the Rosenbergs ' involvement in espionage long before their arrest . Former editor in chief of The Daily Worker John Gates told them , they say , that " ' Julius Rosenberg was very active in the party in City College . . . and one fine day he disappeared . We knew .. . it could have been for only one reason , since he certainly had n't changed his political views . ' " And that reason , Gates made clear , was espionage : * In support of his statement , Gates - recalled that when the Rosenbergs left the Party their subscription to the Daily Worker was also canceled , not in the regular manner by the subscription department but by a direct order from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us by Junius Scales . . . . And Scales recalled hearing from a colleague at the time the Rosenbergs quit the Party that " the task of canceling their ? subscriptions was handled at the very highest level at the time . It was n't done routinely . " But wait a minute . Gates was away in the armed services when the Rosenbergs ' subscription was supposed to have been canceled . How could his " memory " be " confirmed " ' on something he was n't there to know about when it happened ? Junius Scales , the former chairman of the American Communist Party in North Carolina , sent a letter to The New York Times Book Review claiming his interview was " outrageously distorted " : The authors depict me as not being surprised when the Rosenbergs were arrested and charged with espionage because of my knowledge that their subscriptions to The Darly Worker had been discontinued by a top Communist leader some time before , thus helping to " clear " them for work with Soviet agents . In fact , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they were arrested . Max Gordon , senior . editor of The Daily Worker , has completely repudiated Radosh and Milton 's handling of his interview . If the Rosenbergs had been embarking on an espionage career , one would assume they would have done better simply to let their subscriptions lapse , as did thousands of innocent others . But 377 Radosh and Milton seem to have cooked their interview data to make a point not just about the Rosenbergs but about the party . Namely , that the party , the U.S. arm of the international Communist , monolith , was actively involved in spy recruiting and when one went " underground " or into " secret work , " . one became a spy . That certainly was the image of the party held and spread by the F.B.I . and other agencies of the cold war . ' But Radosh and Milton omit to mention that former party members like Max Gordon inconveniently insist that the party 's policy was to steer clear of espionage . And the fact is that at vari , ous points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went underground for a variety of reasons . In the early 1940s some members severed formal . party relations to work as organizers in heavy industry . Later some fled to Mexico or Europe , fearing that fascism was around the corner . In the early 1950s the party sent scores of members underground and put others " on ice " to avoid any roundup of its members . Indeed , some believe the Rosenberg prosecutioh was intended to link the party with spying just , as the Smith Act prosecutions of the party 's leaders were intended to " educate " the public to its subversive , conspiratorial nature . Radosh and Milton 's assumption that the party was in fact a spy recruitment agency perhaps explains their reading too much into the anecdotes of the three ex-Commu.nist sources , but the effect is to reinforce cold war mythology without documenting its validity , and to undermine our confidence in their interviews with critical sources such as the Greenglasses ( who have taken new identities and are not available for additional interviews ) . Radosh and Milton 's obsession with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rosenberg attorney Emanuel Bloch , whose monumental courtroom blunders they attribute less to overwork , understaffing , lack of funds and inexperience at litigation than to his willingness to serve the party at the expense of his clients . It is also apparent in their erroneous history of the Committee to Secure Justice for the Rosenbergs , which they say got off the ground only in November of 1952 as an attempt on the part of Communistt to neutralize the charges of anti-Semitism emanating from the executions of Rudolph Slansky and ten other , mostly Jewish , leaders of the Communist Party in Czechoslovakia . Actually , the committee was formed in the fall of 1951 , sparked by William A. Reuben 's pioneering articles on the case in The National Guardian , from which time its rallies had attracted thousands rather than the handfuls the authOrs report ; and the reason the Party did not get involved earlier probably had nothing to do with orders from the Kremlin , but rather with its ignorance of just what the Rosenbergs had and had n't done . Perhaps my sample is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , abusing a source there , too often taking the F.B.I . at its word , being biased against the party and intolerant of ambiguity may be unscholarly but do not really affect Radosh and Milton 's case . Consider , then , the authors ' treatment of the James Weinstein story , which led Radosh to undertake the book in the first place . It 's worth looking at in some detail , since it is the only time the authors claim to provide " independent confirmation of the existence of a postwar spy network . " And that claim is echoed by others . Thus the sole example Dershowitz provides of the authors ' method of cross-checking : An informer who had been in jail with him Rosenberg told the FBI a de- , tailed story about an espionage trip Julius Rosenberg took to Ithaca , New York . One of the alleged witnesses to these events was subpoenaed by the Federal Grand Jury but refused to talk . Thirty years after , in the belief that the time had now come to set the record straight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal in 1951 . Through many checks on those facts , the authors confirmed the details of the informer 's story and Julius Rosenberg 's role . The informer  --  the man to whom Julius allegedly first told this vague tale  --  was one Jerome Tartakow ( who , as the Schneirs point out , already had a record of convictions for pimping , armed robbery and interstate auto theft ) . The " alleged witness " is James Weinstein , a former member of the Communist Party . The " espionage trip " had Julius going to Ithaca to see Al Sarant , who was running a contracting business . " As to precisely what Rosenberg might have gone up to Ithaca to pick up from Sarant , " write Radosh and Milton , " Tartakow was vague . All he could recall was that Julius had mentioned to him that Sarant had two contacts at Cornell , one a man named Bedda ( pronounced phonetically ) and the other a man named Morris or Morrison . ' " The " independent confirmation " of " the details " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Maxwell Finestone , his friend from Cornell and later his roommate in New York City , once said he had quit the party to do " secret work . " ( Weinstein had no idea what his friend was up to , report Radosh and Milton , " and he knew enough not to ask for details . " ) ; that Finestone frequently borrowed Weinstein 's Buick convertible and once asked him to give a friend named Julius a ride back to New York ( Rosenberg sat in the back and-did n't say a word until they reached the George Washington Bridge , where he got off ) ; and that some months later , after Rosenberg paid an unannounced visit , Finestone turned " white as a sheet " and exclaimed , " He knows he 's not supposed to come here . " Two weeks later- , Weinstein saw a picture in the paper of Julius Rosenberg being arrested as an " atom spy , " and , Radosh and Milton write , he " became enraged at Finestone , not so much for his clandestine activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " Weinstein told Radosh and Milton that this old roommate never tried to explain , but merely said , " I thought it would look better . ' " In May 1978 , Radosh interviewed Maxwell Finestone and asked him to comment on Weinstein 's tale : - , Finestone said that Weinstein was mistaken on several points in his account . On Weinstein 's driving Rosenberg f ' back from Ithaca , Finestone said : " I remember Julius being in Ithaca but I do n't remember that incident . " On Rosenberg appearing at their shared apartment in July 1950 and asking for him , Finestone denied that the incident ever occurred . " I think Jim is fantasizing . I never said to Jim , ' I told him never to come here , ' That is pure fantasy . " Weinstein , he added , was simply " remembering things I just do n't remember . " Finestone did confirm that he dropped out of the Communist Party at Cornell in the middle of his senior year , but claims it was because of schoolwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage in " secret work . " That 's it . That 's the " independent confirmation of the existence of . ' a postwar spy network : " That ' s 11 Ftlfez. " detailed story " - of the " espionage trip " . Julius took to Ithaca . That 's the whole thing , at least according to Radosh and Milton ( according to Tartakow and according to Weinstein ) . But what was confirmed ? Tartakow 's report  --  based on what he claimed Julius told him  --  that it was an " espionage trip " was not confirmed by Weinstein , Finestone , Radosh or anyone else . ( When asked about it at the trial , incidentally , Julius said it was a business trip . ) What Weinstein confirmed was that Julius rode in the back of his car , period . What Radosh confirmed was that the F.B.I . conducted extensive investigations of " Bedda " ( the nuclear physicist Hans Bethe ) and " Morris or Morrison " ( physicist Philip Morrison , co-holder of the patent on the atomic bomb ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And what I confirmed when I checked Weinstein 's F.B.I . file was that Radosh and Milton are guilty of selective use of the files . They neglect to mention that the same sort of circumstantial evidence they use to cast suspicion on Rosenberg , Finestone , Sarant et al . could be used against Weinstein whom they ( and I ) consider above suspicion . A fat sheaf of documents shows that because Weinstein sold his car two days after Rosenberg was arrested , the Bureau suspected Weinstein himself of being tied in with the spy ring . By Radosh and Milton 's ) logic there is as much reason to list Weinstein as a spy suspect as there is to suggest that Finestone was one . It was his car that carried Julius , he roomed with a man he admits told him he was doing secret work , and an F.B.I . memorandum points out that the amount of ) oney he got for the car was approxi- ately the same as the amount of money a girlfriend of another spy suspect mysteriously attempted to deliver to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleveland ! And by F.B.I. ? logic , since Radosh covered up Weinstein 's car deal , there is reason to suspect Radosh , etc. , etc. , etc . Or , in the words of the old song , " Who 's gon na investigate the man who investigates the man who investigates me ? " None of which is to say that Radosh and Milton are necessarily wrong in their surmises , merely that the case is not proven . And what goes for the Weinstein story goes for the other troubling circumstantial evidence Radosh and Milton produce , only more so . For every explanation of guilt there 's an equally plausible one for innocence . The " flight " of Morton Sobell and Sarant and the " disappearance " from his Paris apartment of one Joel Barr , another alleged member of the spy ring ( who is reportedly living in the Soviet Union ) , can be explained as the flight of guilty men to avoid the chair or the emigration of someone who lost his job because of politics ( Barr ) , - who took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , reading of the arrest as an " atom spy " ? of his friend Rosenberg 's brother-in-law , feared implication in a political frame-up ( Sobell ) . Al Sarant 's Morton Street apartment , the subject of countless F.B.I . memorandums , may have been passed from one Communist to another because they were all members of the same spy ring and it was used for microfilming or because there was a stwar housing shortage and , like e erybody else , Communists kept their low-rent apartments in the family . The fact that Harry Gold first told the F.B.I . that he thought the password was " I come from Ben " and only later came up with " I come from Julius " may indicate a refreshed memory or a planted story . The irreconcilable dates on the Hilton Hotel registration card which the government used to corroborate Harry Gold 's story about his visit to Green-glass , may be the result of an F.B.I . forgery ( Walter Schneir and Miriam Schneir ) or Hilton incompetence ( Radosh and Milton ) . The premature destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inertia ( Radosh and Milton ) or careful F.B.I . calculation , ( the Schneirs ) . I submit that a fair reading of the Radosh/Milton-Schneirs exchange in The New York Review of Books is a standoff . My own bias leads me to give the Schneirs a slight edge , especially in their interpretation of F.B.I . materials relating to the independently discredited Elizabeth Bentley and the credibility of Gold , whose imaginary life included a nonexistent wife and children , and Greenglass , whose wife said he had a " tendency to hysteria " ( all witnesses for the prosecution at the trial ) . Also , I think the Schneirs have the better of the argument over whether another member of the alleged spy ring checked out classified materials from Columbia 's Pupin Laboratory . On the other hand , they have not persuaded me that Radosh and Milton forged documents or that the available evidence proves that the Rosenbergs were framed , any more than Radosh and Milton have persuaded me that it proves them guilty . In places where the Schneirs and Radosh and Milton cite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no way of knowing who , if anyone , is guilty of selective research , or whether the files themselves are inconsistent . The evidence , then , is inconclusive ; it cuts both ways . That 's too bad and it 's anticlimactic , but it raises the question of why so many reviewers and commentators are rushing to reconvict the Rosen-bergs on facts that , to use Norman Mailer 's phrase , might turn out to be merely factoids . In his own review of The Rosenberg File , in In These Times , James Weinstein writes that " since the overwhelming majority of Americans  --  if they have any knowledge of the case  --  already Assume that Julius and Ethel were guilty , " the effect of the book . . . will be to discredit the prosecutors of the Rosenbergs and certainly not to heat up the new cold war . " That would be nice , but look around . What 's stirring up the old cold warriors and the neoconservatives is not that Morris Ernst offered to serve as the Rosenbergs ' counsel so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Eisenhower denied clemency because of erroneous information he received from the Director of the F.B.I. , or that the evidence against Ethel was inconclusive , against Sobell invisible . Rather , it is that two self-advertised lefties have found the - Rosenbergs guilty : there was an internal Red menace all along , it is n't so awful to have electrocuted two traitors or even to have abandoned those who defended them , and , besides , it all goes to show that you ca n't trust the Russians . Perhaps the ghost can be purged from the banquet after all . Had the Rosenbergs ' sentence been five or ten years , today we might not remember their names . Had The Rosen- , berg File come out in the 1960s , when the revisionist historians were in the saddle , its guilty verdict might not have been so quickly celebrated , its bias so easily overlooked . But we live in a period of polarization . Affirming the guilt of the Rosenbergs thirty years after the fact turns out to be a way of buying into the Zeitgeist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no room in a polarized culture for a split decision . But to the extent that they are intolerant of ambiguity , they have contributed to that polarization . Even if their facts are correct ( and in my view reasonable doubt persists ) , at best they suggest that the Rosenbergs were bungling conspirators , bush league industrial spies of misguided moral resisters against our nuclear monopoly . Instead , Radosh and Milton undermine their own material by operating from cold war assumptions which permit them to view the Rosenbergs only as instruments of calculated evil . Paul Berman argues interestingly in the September issue of Vanity Fair that the Rosenberg case , brought after the Soviet Union exploded its first atomic bomb , marked the beginning of the nuclear arms race : He goes on , however , to suggest that the old left 's inability to mount an effective opposition was due to its fatal Soviet/K.G.B. links , symbolized by the Rosenberg case . That the old left collapsed in the aftermath of the Rosenberg conviction is true . But cold war mythology notwithstanding , whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the idea that its most serious wounds were self-inflicted rather than the result of the Red hunt , is not credible . Whether or not the Rosenberg family was part of a conspiracy , the significance of the Rosenberg case has to do with what we did to them , not what they did to us . It is a fact of our history , and particularly the history of the cold war years , that the countersubversives did far more damage to our country and our culture than those we choose to label spies and conspirators . One would not understand that from this book . ?
