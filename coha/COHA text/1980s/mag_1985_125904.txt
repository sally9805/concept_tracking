On Sept. 23 Ben Rose , 26 , stood beside a white pine tree in Warren , Vt. , hammer in hand . As co-blazer of the Catamount Trail , a cross-country ski route that covers the length of Vermont , Rose was about to nail the trail 's first marker to that pine . Standing next to him was Steve Bushey , 26 , who helped Rose blaze the trail . // " This is a historic day , " Rose told a group of ski enthusiasts . If that sounds a bit grandiose , he can be forgiven , for he had a right to be proud . Rose and Bushey had spent nearly three years realizing their private dream , to make Catamount the longest Nordic trail in the Northeast . The 300-member Catamount Trail Association has now marked 45 miles of the trail with blazes incorporating the association 's logo , a cat 's pawprint . When the trail is completed in the early 1990s , Bushey and Rose expect it to run 280 miles and connect 21 ski-touring centers along the backbone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the route using a map produced by Bushey and Rose . // " The trail offers something for every level of cross-country skier , " says Bushey . " There 's easy terrain , difficult terrain . You can do short tours or ski from inn to inn , breakfast to bed . Catamount Trail represents the quintessential Vermont style of skiing . " // Bushey and Rose know their subject . Bushey , a native of Williston , Vt. , has been cross-country skiing , hiking and camping since he was eight . " I began winter camping and mountaineering with our outing club at Champlain Valley Union High School , " he says . He and Rose met there in 1974 . " Steve taught me orienteering with a map and compass , " says Rose , " and we did a lot of winter outings together . " // After graduation in 1977 , Bushey enrolled at the University of Vermont ( major : geography ) , while Rose went to Yale ( major : sociology ) . They stayed in touch , however , and during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eastern Canada . // In 1981 , while participating in a Vancouver-to-Vermont bicycle trip , the pair began wondering how to bring the pleasure of day-to-day sports and travel closer to home . Bushey had the answer : Why not ski the length of Vermont ? " I looked at maps and guidebooks and saw a definite geographic pattern for a route along the Green Mountains , " he says , " one that would link a number of existing cross-country trails and ski-touring centers. " // During a camping trip in August ' 82 , he presented his idea to Rose and Paul Jarris , 27 , a friend from college . Both were enthusiastic . That September , Bushey entered the master 's program in geography at Carleton University in Ottawa . He decided to do his thesis on the trail . " It was a way of researching the best route for the trip , " he says . " But more than that , from the beginning I had always envisioned the route as a permanent thing . The thesis became my feasibility review . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rose and Jarris set out on skis from Rowe , Mass. , near the Vermont border . Bushey had arranged lodging at 14 inns along the route . " Before the trip , " says Rose , " none of us had associated Jacuzzis and fine dining with the outdoor experience . We discovered we liked that stuff . " // When the trip ended three weeks later , Bushey and Rose kept moving , forming the Catamount Trail Association ( P.O. Box 897 , Burlington , Vt. 05402 ) , a nonprofit organization of dues-paying volunteers whose function is to develop linkages between existing parts of the route and to maintain the trail overall . This fall , with Northern Cartographic , Inc. , Burlington-based mapmakers , they produced a detailed map of the trail , showing inns and services along its skiable sections . To date , those include 20-mile stretches through Craftsbury , Stowe and South Lincoln , a 15-mile stretch near Camel 's Hump in north central Vermont and shorter sections in the Waitsfield Valley , Mount Tabor and Stratton areas . // " In Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interconnected trail networks and inn-to-inn skiing has been around for years . U.S. trail developers could learn a lesson from them . " // They could learn a few lessons from Bushey and Rose , too .
