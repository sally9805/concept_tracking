Nakasone wins a vote of confidence , sort of <P> His name appeared nowhere on the ballots , but Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone acted as if it did . He carefully screened the candidates who would represent his ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , then took to the hustings to campaign on their behalf . Occasionally , the voters seemed to think that Nakasone was running too . In Maebashi , 60 miles northwest of Tokyo in the heart of his own Gumma prefecture , Nakasone was greeted by posters bearing his picture and hundreds of cheering supporters . At one point he recited a haiku praising the local shrubs , and by inference his local constituency . Looking at ajisai hydrangeas , I feel homesick for Gumma . <P> When the polls closed , Nakasone had reason to smile-if somewhat thinly . In the first national contest since the LDP designated him to be Prime Minister last November , the party picked up an additional three seats in the 252-member upper house of parliament , boosting its total to 137 . ( The LDP already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower house . ) <P> The vote was quickly interpreted by partisans as an endorsement of the new Prime Minister and his strong pro-Western views . Nakasone has been particularly outspoken in his support of the Reagan Administration 's position that Japan should increase defense spending and further open its markets to imports . The election also buoyed Japan 's business community : the Tokyo stock market hit record highs twice last week . On the other hand , the Prime Minister intentionally had skirted foreign policy issues during the campaign . The LDP fell short of its goal of a five-seat gain , and the voter turnout of 57% was the lowest since World War II . The apathetic response could be blamed partly on changes in the electoral system that while designed to focus attention on issues rather than personalities , only confused voters . <P> The big loser was the opposition Japan Socialist Party , which gave up four of its 48 seats . Plagued by factional fighting , the Socialists alienated themselves from their constituents by arguing over such issues as whether Japan should opt for unarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The party failed to win a single seat in some of the largest districts , including Tokyo and Osaka . After the election , many members called for the resignation of Chairman Ichio Asukata , 68 , who had led the group since 1977 . <P> The upper house will be more fragmented as a result of the election . The Communists gained two seats , raising their strength to 14 , while the moderate Buddhist-backed Komeito Party broke even with 27 . Most surprising of all , a clutch of single-issue parties that sprang up especially for this election won representation . The Salaried Workers Party , which called for lower taxes , took two seats , while the Welfare Party , which opposed cuts in social services , won one .
