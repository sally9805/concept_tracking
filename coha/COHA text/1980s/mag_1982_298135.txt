Iraq holds the line , but Khomeini plans to step up the war <P> Under the cover of darkness last Wednesday night , the invading Iranian forces of the Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini launched a large-scale artillery barrage that lit the eastern sky . Tanks rushed forward in long columns , flanked on either side by Iranian Revolutionary Guards carrying rifles with fixed bayonets . Thus resumed the fierce battle for Basra , Iraq 's second largest city , which lies only 14 miles from the Iran-Iraq border . Once again the fighting involved tens of thousands of soldiers on both sides , and in scope and intensity resembled the desert battles of World War II . The Iraqi forces of President Saddam Hussein fought tenaciously to hold their positions , and at week 's end had managed to blunt the Iranian attack . <P> The Iranian tanks were met by fierce fire from Iraqi artillery and helicopter gunships . Khomeini 's troops advanced in waves , stepping over their own wounded on the battlefield , before many fell to join them . " If you ever wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the site , " you should have seen how they advanced and how they were mowed down . Then the flies began to swarm over the Iranian dead . That 's all you could see : the sand , the flies and the corpses . I have never seen anything like it . " <P> The Iraqis claimed that 1,564 Iranians had been killed in the clash and 65 Iranian tanks had been destroyed . For their part , the Iranians claimed that 2,100 Iraqis had been killed or wounded , and that 372 Iraqi tanks and armored personnel carriers had been destroyed . Whatever the truth , casualties were heavy on both sides , and , as U.S. intelligence satellites confirmed , the Iraqi lines had held . <P> Late in the week , fighting continued a mile or two inside Iraqi territory to the east of Fish Lake , the site of an Iraqi victory a few days earlier ( see box ) . The Iranians are still hoping to break through the Iraqi positions and advance quickly to Basra ( est. pop . 500,000 ) , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Iraqi capital . But Iraqi officials suspected that the attacks in the vicinity of Basra might be a diversionary tactic aimed at distracting the Iraqis from a larger and more serious threat to the north . If the Iranians should attack along the central border , where their troops are reported to be concentrated , they would be threatening Baghdad from a distance of only 75 miles . <P> Speculation that the Iranians were on the verge of opening a second front increased Wednesday when two Iranian F-4 Phantom jets staged a dawn air attack on Baghdad . One Iranian plane was shot down and the other dropped its bombs on the wrong target , hitting a hotel instead of the conference center where a meeting of nonaligned nations is scheduled to be held in September , against the strident objections of the Iranian government . <P> <P> Iraqi officials were struck by the fact that the raid had involved only two Iranian planes , and that the pilot of the downed jet turned out to be Major Abbas Dowran , who was famous in the Iranian air force for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected that Iran , in its preparation for an all-out assault along its central border with Iraq , had sent the Dowran mission not only to bomb the Iraqi capital but also to survey and test the city 's air defenses.
