One of the least publicized but most unusual positions taken by the nation ' s oldest civil rights organization here last week was its opposition to the proposed split of the Fifth Circuit of the federal court system . Almost every other civil rights organization or group working for black equality has endorsed the move or chosen not to oppose it . Most of the Fifth Circuit judges , including Frank Johnson , who gave George Wallace fits in the 1960s , want the Fifth divided . So why does the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) oppose this proposed split of a federal court district which nearly everyone agrees has grown too large and too unwieldy ? A succinct answer came from the NAACP ' s general counsel , Thomas I. Atkins , who says , with good reason , " We ' re suspicious of it . We always get suspicous when things that work well for us are the target of proposed changes . " The Fifth Circuit has been by far the most vital and most effective federal court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil rights decisions , no other circuit comes close in the number of significant decisions which have advanced the blacks ' quest for equal access in the nation . Nearly all of the laws aimed at desegregating the nation ' s school system came out of the Fifth Circuit , including the use of public transportation and busing to facilitate school desegregation . Under the proposal , the circuit , which includes Mississippi , Alabama , Georgia , Louisiana , Florida and Texas , would be divided into two districts . One would cover Texas , Louisiana and Mississippi ; the other , Florida , Georgia and Alabama . As Atkins put it , this proposal would transform " a known giant into two unknown entities which may be midgets . " What heightens the suspicion of Atkins and the NAACP is the speed with which it ' s being passed by Congress and the strong support it ' s receiving from the American Bar Association , the same group which has opposed the confirmation of President Carter ' s two black nominees to the Fifth Circuit , Fred Gray and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their illustrious civil rights records , both nominees to the federal bench in Birmingham , Alabama , have been the victims of uwarranted attacks in the Birmingham press and other newspapers , and overly critical reports submitted by the ABA to the Senate Judiciary Committee . As one observer recently wrote , the double standard was indeed at work . The three white nominees to the Alabama bench were treated by the local news media " with gentle respect " and were hardly subjected to the exhausting hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committe as Gray and Clemons were . Clemons was finally confirmed last week , but Gray ' s case is still before the committee , allegedly because it is " more complex . " An example of the types of charges made against Clemons was a local news story that he had been arrested for speeding in 1977 . Further investigation found he had not been arrested and the paper had to print a correction . Another story had Gray guilty of " ambulance chasing " ( a term for soliciting clients ) . But it was later found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statute of limitations on the charge had run out . " We looked at the allegations , and we are convinced that the principal reason why they have been opposed as vigorously as they have is because of their uncommonly uncompromising position on justice for black people . On this issue they were unwilling to give an inch to the establishment . They were unwilling to be compromised , to be had , " he said . With Gray ' s confirmation still being held up , and the nomination of another black , Andrew Jefferson of Houston , still pending , Atkins and the NAACP think approving the split beforehand is akin to putting the cart before the horse . Atkins suggests that the approval process for the division " slows down " until it is known who some of the new judges will be and how they operate . He wondered whether the ABA would be so strongly supportive of the split circuit if it knew Jefferson and Gray would also be confirmed . Of course , it is well known that a split federal circuit would mean more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempting to forestall as many nominations as possible in hopes of a Ronald Reagan victory in November . That would give Reagan a chance at more nominations . This should be all the more reason why the status of Carter ' s judicial nominees should be resolved before Congress approves the split of the Fifth District . It would be unfair to say that Sen. Edward Kennedy , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , is responsible for any delays in this process , although Atkins feels " effective leadership " from Kennedy at this time would be a positive asset . Kennedy ' s staff has been active in trying to get the nominations , including Gray ' s , through the committee . The onus then , should be on Congress to slow the Fifth Circuit proposal until it sees clearer who the new judges will be . Atkins summed up , " The Democratic process is capable from time to time of working with great sped . We just don ' t want it to be one of those aberrations. "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
