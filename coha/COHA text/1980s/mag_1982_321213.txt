" He was referring to the seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran by Iranian militants who took scores of Americans hostage . The date was Nov. 4 , 1979 , and for the next 444 days , " I listened to every proposal " for freeing the hostages , " no matter how preposterous , including dropping an atomic bomb on Tehran . " <P> The hostage crisis is the centerpiece of TIME 'S concluding excerpt from Keeping Faith , Carter 's account of his four years as President . Carter describes the high expectations and dashed hopes that punctuated the long-running drama . He tells how he tried to deal with the Ayatullah Khomeini as if he were " a rational person , " even though , Carter writes , he " was acting insanely .

Almost two years later , and for 14 months afterward , there would be real grief in our country because of Iran . <P> Mohammed Reza Shah Pahlavi tolerated little political opposition at home , but allegations were increasingly heard in the U.S. that his secret police , SAVAK , were brutalizing Iranian citizens . The Shah was a likable man-erect without being pompous , seemingly calm and self-assured in spite of the tear gas incident , surprisingly modest in demeanor . The air of reticence in his first conversations with me could not have been caused by his unfamiliarity with American Presidents .
