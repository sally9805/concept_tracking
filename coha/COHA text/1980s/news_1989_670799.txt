In interviews over the last several weeks , some Japanese defense officials , officers and industrialists said they feared that opposition by many in Washington to the fighter , the FSX , revealed a basic mistrust of Japan that would spill over into future high-technology projects between the two allies. // Even though the Bush Administration ultimately pushed the $8 billion Japanese-American " co-development " deal for the FSX through Congress , the dispute appears to have stepped up a drive within the Japanese military to minimize technological dependence on the United States . <> <> ' There Will Be More Problems ' // Officially , Japan says it is satisfied with the compromises struck on the FSX project and eager to deploy the plane around 1997 . But some Japanese officials suggest that the harsh exchanges during the FSX debate - particularly Congressional charges that Japan planned to divert the fighter-jet technology to build its commercial aerospace business - had marked a change in tone in the postwar military alliance. // " This was the first case in which America stopped giving us the technology " for mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Japanese fighter forces at the Misawa Air Base here , where the FSX will be deployed less than 400 miles from the Soviet Union ' s major Far East military port at Sakhalin Island. // " In the future , I think there will be more problems . " <> <> Little Effect on U.S. Troops // On the surface , the changes are hard to see and will have little effect on the 60 , 000 American troops stationed in Japan . At bases like Misawa , jointly run by American and Japanese forces , General Ishimoda ' s pilots and their American colleagues roar off the runway every few minutes - the Americans in 50 modern F-16 ' s , and the Japanese in aging , Japanese-made F-1 ' s that young pilots openly criticize as awkward and slow. // But senior military officials and bureaucrats now regard it as virtually certain that the United States will begin withholding technologies that were previously transferred to Japan as a matter of course , especially " dual use " equipment with clear commercial use. // So several weeks ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keidanren , suggested that the time was long overdue to double the country ' s budget for military research and development , an oblique way of saying Japan had to design its own weapons rather than produce American models under manufacturing licenses. // Last Wednesday a senior military official talked openly in Parliament for the first time about the possibility of building a small Japanese-designed " defensive " aircraft carrier , Japan ' s first since the end of World War II. // And after battling with Congress and the Bush Administration to obtain computer software codes from the F-16 for use in the FSX , Japanese military officials are now considering a plan to ignore the American technology , in part so that Japan is forced to develop its own . Officials say some of the American software would require extensive alteration in any case to accommodate a new radar system and changed aerodynamic features on the FSX. // " We still do not have a clear idea of whether to depend on the U.S. , or to do as much as we can ourselves , " said Jiro Hagi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agency . " But I think that whenever we can , we are going our own way . " <> <> Most Arms Based on U.S. Designs // For Japan , that approach represents a signficant change of strategy . With the exception of the 15-year-old F-1 fighter , and a few tanks and small missiles almost all of Japan ' s military hardware is based on American designs - though it is produced by Japanese manufacturers under license. // At the bases here at the tip of Honshu Island , troops drive around military bases here in American-style jeeps made by Mitsubishi , and track Soviet submarines in Lockheed P3C surveillance aircraft produced by Kawasaki Heavy Industries and brimming with Fujitsu computers. // A result , experts here say , is that Japan can make many weapons and design relatively few . It spends only 2. 3 percent of its military budget on research and development , or less than $1 billion , though most NATO countries average 10 to 12 percent . Moreover , Japanese industry will not design weapons on its own , because Japan ' s longtime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic market. // Even before the FSX debate , Japan ' s military was pressing for more " indigenous " Japanese weapons . " We realize that no country can obtain perfect self-sufficiency , " said Ryozo Tsutsui , director general of the Japan Defense Agency ' s Technical Research and Development Institute . <> <> ' Technology as a Deterrent ' // Mr. Tsutsui denied that Japan was moving away from its reliance on American aid in the wake of the FSX decision. // But he said , " I believe Japan should keep to the highest state of the art in military technology as a deterrent. " // The institute , little discussed in a country that does not like to be reminded of its military , has laboratories specializing in electronic warfare and also develops lasers and builds aircraft and rocket engines . Another branch works on acoustic system and magnetic equipment for detecting submarines in the straits between Japan and the Soviet Union . Institute officials say they observe Japan ' s ban on nuclear , biological and chemical weapons. // " Our technical capabilities are somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the United States ' new Advanced Tactical Fighter , not yet in production , was " way beyond our skills . " <> <> Bitter Over ' Stealing ' Charges // Mr. Tsutsui ' s advocacy of self-sufficiency is hardly new . When the FSX project began , he argued that Japan should build the craft itself , designing it specifically for Japanese needs . But the Defense Agency was overruled by Yasuhiro Nakasone , then Prime Minister , who decided that the United States should take part to help slacken trade tension . Under the current plan , General Dynamics , which manufactures the F-16 , will get about 40 percent of the FSX development project. // But if the FSX project began by breaking down Japan ' s resolve to build its own advanced weapons , it has now stiffened it . Many Japanese officials , clearly bitter about charges that Japan was " stealing " American technology , contend that France or West Germany would have never faced such virulent criticism . Others say weapons purchased outright from the United States have been rife with quality problems. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Defense Agency now say that they have no incentive to go into new projects with the United States , " a senior official of the Japanese Foreign Ministry said . " They don ' t have a desire to go through the FSX again. " // But Japanese officials point out that the change will come slowly . Japan is still far from a consensus on building major new pieces of military hardware , especially aircraft carriers . <> <> A ' Non-offensive ' Carrier // Until now aircraft carriers were usually considered ships with " war-making capabilities " banned by the Japanese Constitution . But Akira Hiyoshi , chief of the Defense Agency ' s Policy Bureau , said that such regulations would not prevent Japan from building a carrier equipped with antisubmarine helicopters and vertical-takeoff jets for solely defensive purposes . Mr. Hiyoshi ' s comments marked the first time the Government has discussed equipping a carrier with jets. // It is unclear how the United States will respond to the new Japanese initiatives to design its own equipment . On the one hand , American officials have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will find it hard to argue against a doubling in research-and-development funds. // On the other hand , as trade tensions between the two countries grow , any plan to replace American weapons with Japanese models seems bound to prompt new charges that American manufacturers are being cut out of the Japanese market . During the FSX debate , many critics of the deal said Japan should simply buy the F-16. // A tour of military bases showed that those critics had a good deal of support in the Japanese ranks . " I like what I hear about the FSX , " a Japanese officer said , watching with a pilot ' s jealous eye as an American F-16 took off on a training mission . " But we need it now . Instead , we have to wait eight years. " //
