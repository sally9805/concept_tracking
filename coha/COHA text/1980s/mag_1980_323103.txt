Japan jostles the U.S. for supremacy in semiconductor sales <P> Autos are the most visible and painful example , but far from the only one . In recent years one stumbling U.S. industry after another-from shipbuilding to textiles to color television sets-has succumbed to the onslaught of aggressive and efficient foreign competitors , especially from Japan . <P> Now come signs that Japan is looking to add yet another scalp to its lengthening collection of industrial trophies - the $4.8 billion U.S. production of integrated circuits , the hottest and most highly competitive field of advanced industrial technology . The worldwide semiconductor market is expected to soar to $100 billion annually by the end of the century . Moreover , the industry 's key product , the confetti-size sliver of silicon known as the microchip , is revolutionizing everything from giant computers to tiny home appliances , making possible a whole new generation of low-cost machines that can " think " and " talk . " Says Electronics Analyst Benjamin Rosen : " Within 20 years , microchips will be as economically important as autos , steel , energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim to be a first-rate power . " <P> Japan is quietly trying to displace the U.S. , where integrated circuits were developed early in the 1960s , as the world 's leading designer and producer of computer hardware . Already Japanese companies control nearly 25% of the world chip market . Japanese manufacturers have made serious inroads in the 16K RAM ( for random access memory ) chip , which is capable of containing 16,384 separate bits of information . Japanese producers now control 40% of that U.S. market . <P> The foreign challenge traces back to the 1973-75 recession , when orders for circuits plunged and the industry reacted by slashing capital spending in new plants and equipment by 52% . During 1979 , however , demand for the chips surged as toymakers and electronics companies incorporated them into TV computer games and " smart toys " for tots . But domestic producers such as Intel , Advanced Micro Devices and Texas Instruments were unable to fill the orders . Japanese manufacturers quickly filled the gap . <P> To keep their industry forging ahead , Japanese semiconductor firms are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electric and Toshiba are already either taking over existing U.S. semiconductor firms or else setting up plants in the heart of the industry in Santa Clara County 's " silicon valley , " southeast of San Francisco . Japan 's ten largest chip makers plan in 1980 to spend $610 million , vs. $476 million last year , to boost production . While American firms have shipped much of their semiconductor production to countries where labor is inexpensive and work can be done by hand , the Japanese are putting money and expertise into automation . Says Kaiichiro Odagawa , one of Toshiba 's top chip research executives : " We 're using automatic bonding machines , which assure uniform bonding to attach the microscopically thin wires to the chip . " The results are high quality and reliable products .
