Ford Motor Co. said it agreed to buy Sperry Corp. ' s New Holland farm equipment unit for $330 million in yet another consolidation in the ailing farm-equipment industry . Most analysts said the move makes sense for the Dearborn , Mich. - based auto maker , which also makes farm tractors . The merger would allow Ford to expand its product line to include New York-based Sperry ' s haying and harvesting equipment and to take advantage of New Holland ' s U.S. and overseas distribution network . " It makes us a much stronger entry in an industry that is consolidating , " said Philip E. Benton , Ford ' s executive vice president , diversified products . " The players in the game obviously are becoming much bigger and much more integrated , and this puts us right in the lead of the pack . " Wall Street had been expecting the sale of the New Holland division , because Ford and Sperry had been talking for two years about a consolidation of operations , first as a joint venture and most recently as a merger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for information processing , defense and aerospace markets . Analysts said Ford obtained a bargain price for New Holland . Joseph Phillippi , an analyst with E.F. Hutton &; Co. , estimates " they are buying it for 50 cents on the dollar . " Ford also will assume $110 million in liabilities from the Sperry unit . Sperry said it will take a fiscal second-quarter , after-tax loss of about $220 million in connection with the unit sale . In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Ford closed at $45. 50 a share , up 75 cents , and Sperry closed at $48. 375 , up 25 cents . After the acquisition , Ford ' s tractor and farm-equipment business will have combined annual sales of more than $2 billion . New Holland , once a growing business , was hit by the general slump in the farm economy in the past few years . The division ' s profit before interest , corporate expenses and taxes fell to $34 million in fiscal 1985 from $71. 8 million a year earlier , and had peaked at $168. 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $715. 1 million . Gerald G. Probst , Sperry ' s chairman and chief executive officer , said the New Holland division " has continued to outperform the industry in the present weak market . " In an industry plagued with over-capacity , consolidations have been common . In January , Tenneco Inc. paid $301 million in cash and $187 million in Tenneco preference stock for International Harvester Co. ' s farm-equipment business , reducing industrywide tractor capacity as much as 40% . In May , Kloeckner-Humboldt Deutz AG of West Germany acquired Allis Chalmers Corp. ' s agricultural-equipment business for $107 million , which reduced tractor capacity an additional 7% to 8% . Ford ' s New Holland acquisition leaves only a few major players in the industry , including Deere &; Co . , Tenneco ' s J I Case , Deutz-Allis Corp. and Massey-Ferguson Ltd . " This should be the last major consolidation , " said Roy W. Uelner , president of Deutz-Allis . However , the acquisition won ' t immediately reduce production capacity , because Ford and New Holland have little product overlap . Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a consolidation of dealers . Yet few farm-equipment makers see any significant change in demand in the next year . Sales of large farm tractors dropped 10% in the first eight months of 1985 and sales of combines fell 26% , according to the Farm and Industrial Equipment Institute . Analysts pointed out that , in general , Ford and New Holland have been profitable . " This certainly won ' t be a drain on Ford , " said E.F. Hutton ' s Mr. Phillippi , particularly because farm equipment is such a small part of the auto maker ' s operations . Ford ' s 1984 sales were 52. 4 billion . Sperry said the after-tax loss it will take on the sale is expected to be about $220 million , or $3. 86 a share , in its second quarter ended Sept. 30 . This suggests that Sperry will have an overall net loss for the quarter . The company wouldn ' t comment . In the year-earlier quarter , Sperry had profit from continuing operations of $99. 5 million , or $1. 80 a share . Sperry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will use the sale proceeds to concentrate on the electronics business . Sperry ' s electronic systems accounted for 88% of the company ' s $5. 69 billion in revenue in the fiscal year ended March 31 . " The sale will mean that we will be totally an electronic systems supplier , well positioned to expand in our chosen business areas through internal growth , acquisitions and joint ventures , " said Mr. Probst , Sperry ' s chairman and chief executive . Michael Geran , an E.F. Hutton analyst , said Sperry ' s shedding of its troubled farm-equipment business would improve the company ' s full-year earnings by about 20 cents a share . Noting that Sperry has pledged to spend $2. 7 billion on research and development in computers and electronics during the next five years , Mr. Geran said the New Holland sale " marks another step in Sperry ' s strategic decision to play the game in its core businesses . " The sale also reinforced analysts ' belief that Sperry has decided against selling the entire company . Earlier this year , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then with Burroughs Corp . Ford also was mentioned as a possible suitor for all of Sperry.  --  - Ford Increases Dividend DEARBORN , Mich.  --  Ford Motor Co. raised its quarterly dividend on common stock to 70 cents a share from 60 cents , payable Dec. 2 to stock of record Nov. 1 .
