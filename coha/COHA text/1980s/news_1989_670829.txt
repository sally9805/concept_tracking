" I hate hot , sunny weather , " the 45-year-old meteorologist and television star confessed . " I prefer it cold , rainy and miserable. " // Such sentiments are akin to heresy here . In Britain , a nation known for its rainwear , people speak of sun-filled summers the way the French boast of vintage wine years . And this summer is shaping up as a record-breaker , rivaling if not surpassing " the summer of 1976 , " a phrase Britons utter with reverence. // England is enjoying one of its sunniest summers this century . This year is already running ahead of 1976 for the late-spring and early-summer months . A survey taken by Britain ' s Meteorological Office found that the total sunshine in May , June and July amounted to 839. 5 hours , compared with 810 hours in 1976 and more than in any other year this century . <> <> ' More Like Los Angeles ' // The figures for August are not in , but it has been a month of mainly cloudless skies . There have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , and today was cool and overcast , but the sun is supposed to return on Monday . And so far , the month is producing about 35 percent more sunshine than the typical English August , according to a spokesman at the London Weather Center , an arm of the Meteorological Office. // " It ' s been more like Los Angeles than London , " he said. // The effects of all this sunshine - caused by high-pressure air masses lingering a bit longer and farther north than usual - are many and varied . There is , for example , the all but previously unheard-of phenomenon of the homegrown suntan , with bronzed Britons acquiring their glow in the backyard instead of at a traditional place like the Costa del Sol . Sales of bottled water , soft drinks and ice cream are way up . Air conditioners are rare in England , but sales of home units , or " window rattlers , " as they are known here , are buoyant this year . Swimming pool installers are working as never before . Ornamental banana trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summers , are sprouting real bananas. // Still , Mr. Fish is not alone in his disdain for the hot , sunny weather . There are sufferers . The unaccustomed heat has prompted some court judges to allow barristers to remove their wigs . Tempers have also risen with the temperature . Relate , a marriage guidance counselling service , said calls for help have increased by more than 15 percent . Some London hospitals report an upsurge in knife and gunshot wounds treated . <> <> The ' Hosepipe Hooligans ' // Yet the casualty that has stirred the deepest concern is that grand English institution , the garden . Throughout much of England , the shortage of rain has meant reservoirs are low and water companies have imposed a ban on using water for purposes deemed not essential . The use of " hosepipes , " or garden hoses , falls into that category , much to the outrage of the nation ' s gardeners . A few have decided simply to ignore the ban . The offenders have been dubbed " hosepipe hooligans , " by the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of watering was fined $320 last Tuesday in a court in Devon . A retired builder , Norman Read , said he felt " bitter and cheated " by the verdict against him and vowed to save his garden at all costs. // " I ' ve paid for the water and I ' m entitled to use it , " Mr. Read said . " It ' s not my fault if they haven ' t got it. " // Keith Snell , the prosecutor for the water company , said , " The antisocial nature of this offense can not be overstated . " <> <> Climate Is Volatile // To an outsider , the land of the stiff upper lip seems to be overreacting to its summer . Daytime temperatures are actually averaging just above 75 degree Fahrenheit . The hottest day so far this summer was July 22 , when it reached 93. 6 degrees . And if the gardens are a bit thirsty , they people are not . There have been no bans on drinking water or flushing toilets. // But if the English are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is perhaps understandable . England enjoys a moderate maritime climate in general , yet the weather here can be quite volatile from day to day , or hour to hour . " For a populated area , we have some of the most changeable weather in the world , " observed Mr. Fish , the BBC meteorologist. // Rain is a good example . It is not uncommon to wake up to a sunny day , be caught in rain an hour or so later , and bask in the sun again at noon . In England , the person who does not carry a collapsible umbrella in his briefcase at all times is deemed an unbounded optimist or a fool - except this summer . <> <> Blaming America ' s Depressions // In meteorological terms , it is the combination of the Atlantic Gulf Stream , the uneven land configurations of northwest Europe and the atmospheric depressions coming from North America that make England ' s weather so volatile and often rainy . " It ' s all those depressions that come across and zap the British Isles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got rid of America , we would have sunny weather all the time. " // The on-screen style in Britain of the television weather presenter is very different from that of his counterpart in the United States . Asked about American weather telecasts , he replied : " It ' s entertainment , all singing , dancing and telling jokes . The weather seems to come in almost as an afterthought. " // The other big trans-Atlantic difference is money . The highest-paid television weatherman in the United States is Willard Scott , appearing on the NBC News program " Today . " His salary is reported to be more than $1 million a year . Mr. Fish , by contrast , is a British civil servant , assigned to the state-owned BBC by the Meteorological Office . Though a national celebrity of sorts , his civil-service salary is estimated at less than $40 , 000 a year. // " The only way I can get paid more is working overtime , evenings and weekends , " Mr. Fish said. //           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
