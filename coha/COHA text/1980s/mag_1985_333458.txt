" The inevitable end of a protracted financial adventure . " That was how State Controller Yitzhak Tunik , the government ombudsman , described Israel 's bank- stock crash in a harsh report released last week . Tunik 's 107-page document concerned the financial turmoil of October 1983 , when investors sold off shares of Israel 's major banks , forcing the government to shut down the Tel Aviv stock exchange for two weeks . By the time trading resumed , bank stocks had lost a third of their dollar value , and the government had pledged to buy the shares at precrash prices to keep investors from taking a beating . The collapse heightened an economic crisis that drove Israel 's inflation above 1000% , at an annual rate , last October and continues to threaten the country 's political stability . <P> After a year of investigation , Tunik blamed the banks for bringing on " a catastrophe for the economy " and faulted the government of former Prime Minister Menachem Begin for doing nothing to prevent the crash . The roots of the trouble go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israeli banks started buying and selling their own shares on the Tel Aviv exchange to help regulate the stock prices . In 1979 Israel 's inflation passed 100% , and the public bought bank stocks as a hedge against rising consumer prices . The banks encouraged this speculation and helped keep the bank-stock values climbing by dipping more heavily into the market to buy their own shares . As a result , bank-stock prices rose faster than inflation . <P> But in the process , the Tunik report concluded , the stocks ' value reached a level that was nearly three times the banks ' capital . Tunik said that the bankers ' strategy of buying shares amounted to " manipulative regulation " and helped send their prices to an artificial height and an inevitable fall . The report noted that Meir Heth , chairman of the stock-exchange board , predicted the collapse , but his warnings were ignored by the Israeli Treasury and the central bank . <P> Tunik estimated that by 1988 the government 's pledge to support the bank- stock prices will cost it at least $2.5 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2.6 billion in aid the U.S. plans to give Israel this year . The cost of the crash is a heavy burden for Prime Minister Shimon Peres , who is trying to cut the Israeli budget as a way of fighting inflation and reviving the country 's economy . <P> Last week 's report is only the beginning of the investigations of the bank- stock fiasco . Tunik accused no individuals by name , but called on the Knesset to appoint a full-scale commission to delve deeper into the financial disaster . Ha'aretz , a prominent Tel Aviv daily newspaper , demanded a probe " to determine who is responsible and to recommend steps to be taken against them . "
