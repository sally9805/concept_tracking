In most countries on that continent an ' ' official ' ' language competes with the language of the dominant tribe , which competes with a number of other tribal languages . Not everyone has the opportunity to learn the ' ' official ' ' language or to be a member of the dominant tribe . The result : Language is a barrier to many people and a tool of discrimination for others. // The United States government has debated over the years whether or not the citizens of this country should have an ' ' official ' ' language . This question grows ever more pressing as refugee populations around the world begin to rise and the US considers taking in more. // // With millions of illegal immigrants crossing its borders every year , the US can no longer push the question aside . The US needs to make a commitment to English as its national language and begin putting many more resources into public and private institutions specifically for English instruction. // Minority populations ( that will one day no longer be in the minority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will say it is an attempt to handicap them , to make them adhere to white , middle-class standards , make it difficult for them to apply for welfare , and to strip them of their cultures and traditions . Spanish-speaking Americans , the second largest language group in the US , will be the most vocal . Many want Spanish to be in the running for ' ' official ' ' language , or at least be given equal status. // The issue , however , is not prejudice , nor the alienation of certain peoples , nor stripping them of their identity . It is whether the US will make a political and financial commitment to one language and thus ensure that all Americans , including those who count English as their mother tongue , communicate well . It is a question of having one common element , amid our rich diversity , that gives each of us an essential tool for working within our communities and economy. // A single ' ' official ' ' language would not , in fact , oppress certain groups , but give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two young Soviet friends , we ' ll call them Rudolf and Vladimir , illustrate this point. // Rudolf , when I met him , had been in the US about nine months . His English was still minimal . He was collecting welfare , having exhausted his refugee monies , and sort of looking for work and admittance to one of the local universities. // Vladimir spoke near-fluent English upon his arrival . In about four months he had his own apartment , he had been accepted to one of this nation ' s most prestigious universities , and he had a job teaching Russian to English speakers . Rudolf , even a year after Vladimir ' s arrival , was still on welfare , working ' ' cash-paying ' ' jobs on the side , and still hoping to enter a university . The key difference between the two : English skills. // I have observed , in my years of working with refugees , that those who commit themselves to learning English are far more able to take care of their own basic needs - employment , shelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when these needs are met , new Americans are able to give thought and time to protecting their culture and traditions from the onslaught of Western culture. // They have the time and energy to devote to this - through community ethnic groups , festivals for dancing and feasting , and , most important , through teaching their children to appreciate their heritage . They also have the time - and the skill - to share this heritage with Americans who might otherwise be ignorant of it and seek to oppress it. // Most immigrants who come slowly to English , or never learn the language , spend their days in a hand-to-mouth existence . They work two to three jobs and have little time for taking part in ethnic-oriented activities . And they have little time to spend in passing their native tongue and an understanding of their cultural heritage on to their children. // Indeed , in families that lack a commitment to have all members learn English , home relationships often break down . Parents find that their children , who more readily acquire the new language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the parents , because of inadequate language skills , are left to menial and poor-paying jobs that leave no time to nurture and maintain family ties , their language and traditions will never get to the children . In fact , many of these children begin to associate the native language and culture with the poverty of their parents and the lack in their own lives . The ' ' old ways ' ' become the focus of resentment. // Closed off from the world their children are experiencing , these parents are often unable to bridge this gap - an abyss far more complicated than the so-called ' ' generation gap . ' ' These are some of our nation ' s most ' ' dysfunctional families. ' ' // In a very real way , the country ' s inability to commit itself , politically and financially , to the English language , is responsible for such family woes . By admitting tens of thousands of refugees every year without requiring that they acquire the most basic tool for survival , the US sets them up for failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their children have to offer. // This nation can no longer afford its lack of commitment to English . It is paying too much in welfare , social services , and bilingual education programs that often drag on and on because the immigrants do not have the one thing they need to get a job . It is paying more dearly through the turmoil in the personal lives of immigrants and the loss of contributions these people could make to society. // The US immigration system should be reformed to include , as part of the refugee ' s initial financing , six months of intensive English instruction at a facility accredited to teach English as a Second Language ( ESL ) . This is especially necessary for adults . This would mean establishing many more affordable ESL programs . Today , there are not enough spaces for the refugees who want to learn English. // All of this means putting a great deal more money into the refugee ' s first months here . But if the US would make this one commitment , it would find that most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lingering , like Rudolf , for more than two years collecting welfare. // This step toward a one-language policy must be backed by a similar commitment to English and good communication skills in the public school system . It ' s not only the immigrants who have a hard time filling out job applications and writing a cohesive paragraph . We shouldn ' t demand that immigrants learn English while allowing many native-born American to escape a command and appreciation of the language. // Additionally , these steps must be followed by a system that requires every well-educated English speaker to have a working knowledge of a foreign language . Our national security and our ability to compete in foreign markets demand more bi- and multilingual Americans . This will keep a one ' ' official ' ' language policy from reinforcing a mentality is already pervasive in the US : that English is the only language anyone needs to know. // It ' s not . But it is the most essential tool for beginning life anew in the US . And it is a key element to keeping our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
