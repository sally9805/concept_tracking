The diversity and virtuosity of artisanship is stunning in this presentation - the first major Tang art show held anywhere in 30 years . Giuseppe Eskenazi , a leading dealer in this field , who has long been among the most prominent buyers of major Tang works at auctions , assembled the 41 offerings during the last four years . Remarkably , none of these objects , including the three unglazed figures that may have been recovered in the numerous Tang tomb excavations completed during the last 10 years - had been in auctions. // The response by collectors and museums was immediate and impressive . By last weekend , 25 works had been sold , three to museums - the Dallas Museum of Art acquired a pair of tomb guardians , and the Cleveland Museum of Art purchased an earthenware ewer. // The wealth of objects , ranging across most of the dynasty ' s reign , from A.D. 618 to 907 , documents the Tang taste for pageantry and a delight in foreign influences in three major areas - metalwork , Buddhist stone and bronze sculpture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energetic realism , a quality visible in more than a score of the show ' s selections. // Many of the more compelling objects are functional - not merely bibelots or well-crafted conceits conceived to satisfy the taste of scholars or esthetes . Outstanding among the silver is a pierced spherical censer , a tour de force of metalworking , its surface aswirl with chased flowers , fruits , leaves and parrots . Worn on a chain pinned to clothing to scent the air around the wearer or to repel insects , the hinged ball opens to reveal a tiny cup for incense or perfume that pivots on an axis so that the contents never spill. // The vessel is one of five works sold before World War II by the Hakutsuru Museum in Kobe , Japan . Another of these Hakutsuru treasures , an eighth-century silver cup , is a study in undulating movement - from the vines scrolling over its surface to the gracefully curved tab end on the ring handle. // Mediterranean and Oriental motifs merge on these and other silver miniatures - cosmetic boxes , cups , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punched , embossed and engraved decoration . The patterns are alive with fantasy and movement . A pair of baroque silver earrings depict writhing dragons with bulging eyes , scaly heads and tails of flames and flowers . On mirrors , boxes and plates , dancers are depicted leaping , lions crouching , phoenixes flying. // Earthenware Tang figures - especially horses and camels - are as eagerly sought today as status symbols in decorating as Tiffany lamps were a decade ago . The exhibition includes several boldly scaled figures of a horse , camel and tomb guardians in brilliantly colored ceramics . Sculptural realism is combined with the epoch ' s new mastery of polychrome glazing in which greens , browns , cream and orange dramatize shimmering surfaces , as can be seen on the pair of tomb guardians purchased by the Dallas Museum . Even ewers , Iranian in form , Chinese in decoration , show a rare sophistication in modeling and glazing . Two of these vessels , which have ridged spherical bodies , narrow necks , dragon handles and beaked heads , are washed in free-flowing colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morris Louis paintings . The Cleveland museum purchased the more expressive example of the two. // The palette on other ceramic works is sometimes simpler . A caramel-colored horse is depicted without a saddle , one foot poised to prance , head turned slightly , mouth open - with a splash of cream on its forehead . The camel - a cream-toned , striding beast with hairy brown humps , throat , mane and hooves - has a thick stripe of green defining one side of the face , from nostril to ear . The tallest work , an unglazed guardian standing 31 inches , is the fiercest and among the most ambitious in coloring , from its pink face , black brows and mustache , to its gilded breast plate and multicolored armor. // The show ' s handsomely illustrated catalogue ( $50 ) presents historical and esthetic explanations of the style in a clear , insightful essay by William Watson , an art historian who formerly headed the Percival David Foundation of Chinese Art in London and is professor emeritus of Chinese art and archeology at the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from $1 , 600 for a tiny eighth-century cosmetic box to $360 , 000 for the camel or pair of tomb guardians . Mr. Eskenazi gave several examples of how Tang works have skyrocketed in price since 1970 . A figure of a tall Tang lady of the court that he purchased that year at $18 , 000 reappeared last year , and he purchased it again - for $365 , 000 . A polo player figure handled several times by Mr. Eskenazi more than doubled in value between 1974 , when he purchased it at Christie ' s in London for $120 , 960 , and 1986 , when he acquired it again at Sotheby ' s in London for $269 , 056. // Tang pottery figures - a camel , groom , horse and woman - and a small gilded bronze of a lion are elements , too , of the show at Gerald Godfrey Far Eastern Art at 104 Mount Street . The Hong Kong dealer , who heads Charlotte Horstmann and Gerald Godfrey Ltd. , opened in London last fall with an exhibition of Chinese paintings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from archaic bronzes to contemporary paintings and ceramics. // The earliest works are among the most impressive , whether a pottery jar of the Warring States period , dating from 475 to 221 B.C. , or a massive pottery Tang horse . The horse , one of two pieces sold as a lot at Christie ' s in New York , was purchased by Mr. Godfrey , competing against Mr. Eskenazi , on June 4 for $572 , 000 . Mr. Godfrey had the groom and horse crated swiftly and flown to London for the show . The prices are $800 , 000 for the horse and $145 , 000 for the groom. //
