The son also rises <P> So little is known about the second son of North Korean President Kim II Sung that Westerners are not sure about even the facts of his birth . Kim Jong II is thought to have been born in February 1941 , somewhere in the Soviet Union , to Kim II Sung 's first wife . According to the best surmise , he attended East Germany 's air academy . He may have graduated with an economics degree from Pyongyang 's Kim II Sung University about 1965 . In the early 1970s , Japanese visitors were told that he was involved in the " three-revolution " movement in North Korea , an attempt to rebuild the country ideologically , technologically and culturally . After 1977 , he disappeared from even the private conversations of Pyongyang officials . Speculation in Seoul and Tokyo had it that the young Kim had been badly injured in a traffic incident , perhaps during an attempt on his life . <P> As it happens , Kim Jong II is very much alive and well in Pyongyang . The Sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anointed him as heir apparent of his dictatorial father . From the outset of the congress , when the 29 members of the Communist Party Presidium took their seats on the stage of Pyongyang 's Cultural Palace , the purpose of the conclave was clear . When Kim Jong II was introduced to the 3,230 party delegates , there was a perceptible stir in the hall : the young Kim was accorded no less than fifth place in party precedence . The congress , in fact , did better . Before it adjourned last week , it confirmed Kim Jong II as No. 4 in the Politburo Standing Committee , No. 3 in the sensitive Military Affairs Committee and-most significant-No. 2 , after his father , in the party Secretariat . <P> What was behind Kim Jong Il 's eclipse-and his subsequent emergence into party leadership ? Observers could only guess . Many noticed that Kim II Sung 's younger brother , Kim Yong Ju , once considered a possible successor , was nowhere evident on party rosters . One guess was that Kim Yong Ju had lost out to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party struggle . <P> Pyongyang watchers predicted that Kim II Sung will concentrate on foreign affairs , his son on domestic problems . If he is elevated to the presidency , Kim Jong II is not likely to soften his father 's hard line toward South Korea . He is feared as a hawk in Seoul , where one analyst said darkly : " Our relations with North Korea are about to enter a new era of cold war . "
