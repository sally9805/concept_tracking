BLACKPOOL , England  --  Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will receive a standing ovation here this afternoon when she strides to the rostrum to address the Conservative Party ' s annual conference , two days before her 60th birthday . Reelected in a landslide two years ago , she talks about becoming the nation ' s grandmother and serving for another decade or more . So these should be balmy days for Mrs. Thatcher , who is surely Britain ' s best-known leader since Winston Churchill . But she and her party are in deep trouble , and almost everybody here knows it . " We have to recognize that the policies don ' t seem to have dealt with our problems , " says Edward Heath , the former Tory prime minister and no friend of Mrs. Thatcher . " People just seem to be growing tired of her , " says Peter Riddell , political editor of the Financial Times and author of a careful and often sympathetic analysis of Mrs. Thatcher ' s first six years in office . " They believe she has failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led by an increasingly unpopular prime minister , is bad news for the United States . Britain is the U.S. ' s loyal partner and Mrs. Thatcher and President Reagan maintain a high regard for one another . The alternative to this woman and this government is Neil Kinnock and the Labor Party , who vow they will remove all nuclear weapons from Britain and send home the Americans who operate them , or David Steel and David Owen , leaders of the Liberal-Social Democratic alliance , who are still struggling to put together a cohesive program . It is the Conservatives ' standard line that the problems will go away when Britons realize just how much this Tory government has accomplished . This is accompanied by a broad attack on the press for failing to report the " good news . " Typical was Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson ' s reference Wednesday to the British Broadcasting Corp. as the " Britain Bashing Corp . " Opinion-makers in Britain , he says , tend to be " unpatriotic . " So the party has embarked on a vast public-relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Thatcher . " We have been pitiful  --  pitiful !  --  in getting our message across , " says Jeffrey Archer , the best-selling author and now the unpaid deputy party chairman . And there have been positive accomplishments to boast about . This government won a difficult war with Argentina in the South Atlantic . Mrs. Thatcher was tough , resolute and altogether commanding . Her ratings in the polls surged . Inflation rates that had leaped to more than 28% have been cut to 6. 2% and should continue to decline . Dozens of state-owned industries have been successfully returned to private ownership . In a series of fierce showdowns , the brutal power of many left-wing trade unions has been cracked , if not broken . Hundreds of thousands of working-class Britons have purchased the public houses in which they lived  --  and now view politics as members of the property-owning class . Industrial productivity is up . But there remain more than three million Britons out of work and on the social-security dole . The unemployment rate is more than 13% and nothing the government does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are asking the oldest political question of all : What have you done for us lately ? Not much , they seem to be saying . And , if polls being spun out each day this week by BBC can be believed , they aren ' t very encouraged about what Mrs. Thatcher can do for the country in the future . There is a problem here . Part of it is the way Mrs. Thatcher is perceived by Britons . " Her style is simply out of synch with the times , " says Mr. Riddell , the author-journalist . " People are fed up with her hectoring them constantly , " adds Robert Worcester , a poll taker . The prime minister springs from very ordinary roots . Her father was a grocer in small-town Grantham . But she no longer sounds ordinary . Her voice is upper class , the slight plumminess developed , it is said , during her time at Oxford University where she studied chemistry . ( She is also a qualified lawyer . ) " I am not as posh as I sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who finds small talk difficult and who suffers fools not at all . There are almost no anecdotes about her to indicate she has a sense of humor or any sense of her own vulnerability . Unlike her friend , Mr. Reagan , the no-stick Teflon president , she has no reserves of good will to fall back on when things go wrong . She gives no quarter ; she takes none . The lady , as people say , is not for turning . Even loyal friends wonder if much can be expected of a public-relations campaign aimed at giving the nation a " new " Margaret Thatcher . " More and more , " says Robin Hodgson , a former Tory MP attending the conference here , " we are moving toward the American system . Mrs. Thatcher has had so much exposure it ' s hard to believe you could adjust her image . I think we have to stick to policy . " She had her big chance to institute sweeping change following her party ' s landslide victory in 1983 . But , critics say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the one to abolish the big-city , left-wing governing councils , especially the Greater London Council . She won the war , but the GLC achieved a public-relations triumph , convincing Londoners the GLC was good for them and leaving many voters bitter . What she had set out to do in her first term was turn this country upside down , roughly the way Mr. Reagan was proceeding in the U.S. She wanted to introduce more competition in industry , in the health service , everywhere . She vowed to privatize state-owned industry and break the back of the big unions . More importantly , she wanted to make Britain a nation of entrepreneurs . She was partly successful . She managed to address many of the symptoms and she came up with a few of the cures . More and more , in her second term , though , she has been seen to be losing her steady grip . Timing is frequently bad . She announced big pay hikes for her senior ministers , for example , when teachers and others were struggling for more modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the way tax rates are established , only to be forced to back down . She has preached Victorian morality and law and order , only to witness staggering increases in the crime rate and flaming disorder in the inner cities . Now , admittedly deep in mid-term doldrums , she and her associates seem to be adrift on questions of where to go from here . On the one hand , her leaders in the House of Commons urge her to move cautiously . Build on past accomplishments , they say , and don ' t rock the boat between now and the next election two years away . Other advisers remind her that she was elected as a radical and she should rock just as many boats as she can . The evidence is accumulating , though : Mrs. Thatcher is becoming more and more cautious . Stimulate the economy with whopping tax cuts ? No , her advisers say privately ; that might work in America , but it won ' t work in Britain . People here are different ; they ' re not very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No , her advisers say , privately again , Britons  --  even Tories  --  like their welfare state . This Tory government , once so radical , wants everyone to know , in fact , that it has expanded the welfare state . There will be no bold new initiatives . The government will try to hold the line , consolidate the gains and convince errant Tories they should come back to the fold . " We can win , " says Mr. Hodgson , the ex-MP , " if we can consolidate our traditional support . " It will get rough . The Tory strategy is to attack and attack again . Keep the opposition on the defensive . The party ' s new chairman , Norman Tebbit , introduced the strategy at this conference . Labor , he said , is " red " and dangerous . The alliance , perhaps the real threat to Tory hegemony , is divided in its leadership , confused in its policies and opportunistic in its ambitions . " History ' s verdict on Mrs. Thatcher , " says Peter Riddell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dished her party . " Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
