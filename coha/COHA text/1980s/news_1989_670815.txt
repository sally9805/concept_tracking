So proclaims the 70-year-old , exhausted-looking scalawag Onizawa ( Rentaro Mikuni ) in Juzo Itami ' s fine , scathing new comedy , " A Taxing Woman ' s Return , " which opens today at the Lincoln Plaza. // Onizawa , the self-styled Chief Elder of a bogus religious sect called Heaven ' s Path , has been brought in for questioning about some illicit real estate deals and a sizable amount of unreported income. // Having begun on a note of poetic confession , Onizawa seizes the banner of patriotism. // " I open land for Japan , " he tells the startled tax investigators . " Tokyo must be an international center , but there isn ' t office space . We must build more buildings , but where ? You ' ll never use eminent domain . That ' s why we must act . " The bureaucrats aren ' t ready for Onizawa ' s passion , but then they don ' t know Onizawa. // The old man works himself into a froth . " To revitalize Japan , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , Tokyo will be bypassed by Hong Kong and Seoul . Do you want that ? Do you want Japan to become a second-rate power ? " // He rises from the table and begins to bash his head furiously against the white wall . Blood drips from both the wall and Onizawa as he screams : " I ' m being tortured ! I ' m being tortured ! " // Onizawa , his head bandaged , his nostrils stuffed with cotton , returns home from the interview very pleased with himself. // Onizawa is a vicious , lecherous , crafty old rogue , who , when he must , deals in murder . That he also is unexpectedly engaging is due in part to the rich performance by Mr. Mikuni , a kind of Japanese Raimu , whose face is collapsing but whose eyes remain implacably fixed on the prize. // Mostly , though , the character is a reflection of the particular satiric talent of Mr. Itami , who wrote and directed " The Funeral , " " Tampopo , " " A Taxing Woman " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // Mr. Itami plays against expectations . He loves having the wrong people say things the audience might think are right , or almost . In allowing Onizawa to be so persuasive , he gives folly and corruption a human face . Had this most witty and original of contemporary Japanese directors made " Mr. Smith Goes to Washington , " Mr. Smith would have been a secondary character . Mr. Itami is far less interested in celebrating virtue than in dissecting mendacity. // " A Taxing Woman ' s Return " is a sequel , but it ' s a very different kind of movie from the first , which introduced the " taxing woman , " Ryoko ( Nobuko Miyamoto ) , the former housewife who , after one setback and another , finds self-realization as a tax inspector. // In the new film , Ryoko is a fully formed character , one who functions much in the way of the lead of a television series . " A Taxing Woman ' s Return " is about Ryoko ' s further adventures , this time with Mishima ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as her partner. // Their immediate objective is the Heaven ' s Path religious cult , which is suspiciously rich for what looks to be a comparatively modest collection of fanatics . Their work isn ' t easy . It turns out that there are more registered religions in Tokyo than there are barbers. // Onizawa and his wife , the Holy Matriarch ( Haruko Kato ) , drive around in his and hers Rolls-Royces . The Holy Matriarch has a special fondness for floor-length sable coats and Onizawa for women , especially for Nana , the pig-tailed 16-year-old who has been left with him as collateral on a loan. // The movie proceeds as a cat-and-mouse game as Ryoko and Mishima investigate the Heaven ' s Path cult and discover that Onizawa is , in fact , the front man for a group of crooked businessmen and corrupt members of the Diet. // This unholy alliance is changing the skyline of Tokyo , evicting tenants , buying land and putting up the sorts of spectacular high-rises that now dominate the city ' s western district of Shinjuku . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the traditional Tokyo in which form has , until now , followed function . The " new " Tokyo could be the last Tokyo. // This is the subtext of the movie , which goes out of its way to disguise its serious concerns. // In " A Taxing Woman ' s Return , " Mr. Itami employs the mechanics of movie melodrama with unabashed gusto - stake-outs , car chases , disguises , secret chambers and even the kind of mysterious jewel that might turn up in an " Indiana Jones " adventure . With the exception of Onizawa , the movie is less interested in character than in scene , which is tumultuous and often Bunuelian. // Nothing could be more Bunuelian than the wintery love affair of Onizawa and the innocent Nana . She comes to adore the dirty old man who makes her pregnant and who then , as a sign of his undying love , proudly buys her a cemetery plot next to his mausoleum. // There is also something of Luis Bunuel in Mr. Itami ' s eagerness to disorient his audience with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the lingering image of a corpse that ' s been some weeks in the water. // Representing the film ' s conscience are Ryoko , Mishima and their comically gung-ho colleagues though , except for a parting glance at the end , they never betray their feelings in any overt fashion . Miss Miyamoto , in her Louise Brooks bob and wearing modishly baggy slacks , is a steadfast charmer , and a far more endearing crime buster than Batman. // As photographed by Yonezo Maeda and scored by Toshiyuki Honda ( who is to Mr. Itami what Nino Rota was for Federico Fellini ) , " A Taxing Woman ' s Return " has the flashy look and romantic sound that have become the director ' s singular style. // However , don ' t be deceived by the cool , breezy manner of " A Taxing Woman ' s Return . " It scalds. // It ' s another major film from the man who is possibly the only true social satirist at work in movies today . <> <> Tokyo for Sale <> <> A TAXING WOMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in Japanese with English subtitles ; director of photography , Yonezo Maeda ; edited by Akira Suzuki ; music by Toshiyuki Honda ; production design by Shuji Nakamura ; produced by Yasushi Tamaoki and Seigo Hosogoe ; a New Yorker Films Release .
