" Like a shootout in a cowboy movie , only it wasn ' t a movie <P> The clatter of mess-hall cleanup had just given way to the nocturnal sounds of the jungle when Sergeant Manit Kammung and 800 other Thai Border Patrol Police suddenly received orders for a maneuver in the north . Armed with assault rifles , grenades , recoilless rifles and rocket launchers , the men clambered aboard trucks and rode all night through the newly harvested rice fields of central Thailand . Finally the trucks began to growl up the narrow roads that climb to the Golden Triangle , the opium-rich territory where the borders of Thailand , Burma and Laos converge . <P> At daybreak the convoy reached the border town of Ban Hin Taek , the fortified mountain stronghold of Khun Sa , the most powerful opium warlord in Asia . Their objective : capture the town and crush the 2,000 mercenaries of Khun Sa 's Shan United Army , who ran the opium refineries and ruthlessly held sway over the entire region . The Thai soldiers promptly took up battle lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ten yards away stood the surprised drug traffickers , many of them routed from bed and still in their underwear-but heavily armed with automatic weapons . <P> " You are under arrest for smuggling , possession of weapons and insurgency , " shouted Colonel Thong-Aun Charoen-sam . " Lay down your guns and surrender . " <P> The bedraggled Line of Shans , some of whom had been passing a bamboo bong filled with marijuana when the Thai soldiers arrived , looked startled for a moment , then raised their weapons and opened fire . " It was like a shootout in a cowboy movie , only it was n't a movie , " recalled Sergeant Manit . " I 've been in many battles with Communist insurgents , but they were nothing compared with this . " <P> The house-to-house battle for the town late last month lasted three days . Only with the support of OV-10C aircraft , which strafed the dense surrounding jungle , were the government forces able to defeat the opium mercenaries , who fled across the border into Burma . At least 51 mercenaries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thai soldiers picked their way through the rubble afterward , they were amazed to find that Ban Hin Taek in no way resembled a jungle village . It was a modern town with tennis courts , a soccer field and shops stocked with electric guitars and leather furniture . Officers and chemists in Khun Sa 's narcotics army lived in spacious villas with manicured lawns . The warlord himself kept a hilltop aerie outfitted with a television in every room , an elaborate stereo system and a swimming pool . There were even photograph albums of family vacations in Hong Kong . The soldiers also discovered huge caches of weapons , ammunition and communications equipment . <P> Khun Sa , who at 50 is regarded as the undisputed " king of the Golden Triangle , " proved as elusive as ever . Born in Burma to Chinese parents , he turned to soldiering at an early age and adroitly manipulated a princely marriage for his mother and connections with the Burmese government to set himself up in the drug trade . Since 1964 , he has successfully challenged the opium operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their armies sought sanctuary in the triangle in 1950 and developed the lucrative drug trade .
