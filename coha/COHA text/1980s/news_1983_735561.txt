txt American Surgery Centers limped onto the health-care scene just over two years ago with an initial public offering of four million shares at 50 cents a share and has been bleeding red ink ever since . So far , the company operates just one surgery center in Indianapolis , providing low-cost facilities for minor surgery that does n't require an overnight stay by patients . But some Wall Streeters have been buying the stock recently on the theory that the Phoenix , Ariz. - based concern could make money in the health-services industry . The stock traded as high as 44 in 1981 on this hope but fell back to around 2 through most of 1982 as investors realized the company lacked capital to launch an expansion program . Interest in the company has arisen again , however . American Surgery shares started advancing near the end of December and have nsen about 55% in the past two weeks to finish yesterday 's session at 4 1/16 bid in over-the-counter trading . Volume also jumped ; in the same penod , nearly 15% of the company 's 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company recently secured $25 million in credit lines from an unidentified financial institution . Also , it expects to receive a major equity investment for about 25% of the company by Feb. 15 : Lynn R. Singley , American Surgery 's chairman and a consultant for 10 years to the surgery-center industry , says the buyer will be a " large , well-known insurance company . " Kramer Capital Consultants , a consulting and investment-banking firm specializing in the insurance industry , says it has agreed to try to arrange a private equity placement for American Surgery . Laurence E. Levine , Kramer Capital 's senior vice president and director of investment banking , says several insurance companies and financial institutions have " expressed an interest " in American Surgery and that one of them may wind up committing cash . Even without the equity financing . Mr. Singley says , the company will open three centers in the first quarter and " at least " six more by year-end . The company plans to own 52 centers within three years . he adds , but the equity infusion could double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say American Surgery also is negotiating a potentially large contract to build and oper02e centers in Saudi Arabia . Investor enthusiasm comes from projections that outpatient surgery will boom in the 1980s and 1990s as pressure grows to keep hospital costs down . Surgery-center operations typically cost half as much as similar operations in a hospital . Several major health insurers , including Aetna Life &; Casualty , pay policyholders more liberal benefits for minor operations performed in surgery centers . The benefits still would cost insurers less than they would pay for similar hospital services . Mr. Singley says American Surgery should earn 32% pre-tax on centers operating above 20% of capacity . Above 50% of capacity , he says , margins should expand as costs level off . He estimates that a center running at capacity-10,000 operations annually  --  can generate $4.5 million a year revenue . Mr. Levine says he spent several months investigating American Surgery before agreeing to attempt a private placement for it . He and others conclude that the company 's key to success will be whether it can win support among doctors . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to sell it to the doctors , " he says . Mr. Singley , 44 , through a consulting firm he used to own , has helped set up about 80 of the 130 surgery centers in the U.S. Analysts say he is the company 's strong suit . Jerry Blythe , an Indianapolisbased money manager and securities analyst , says , " Lynn knows this business from the ground up and just about everybody in it . If anybody can make a large-scale success of this business , he can . " While the concept seems timely and logical , the company still is losing money . Some analysts estimate a net loss of about $400,000 for 1982 and only a modest profit for this year as startup costs continue to depress earnings . As a result , analysts say , the stock may languish until the company begins to report significant earnings growth , possible in 1984 . Also , some analysts think major hospitalmanagement companies wo n't sit idly by as the surgery-center industry grows . " The risk is that community hospitals wo n't allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. Cosgrove , an analyst at Bateman Eichler , Hill Richards in Los Angeles . " Doctors still control the patient , and if they decide they want to remain loyal to the hospital , they might forgo moving a patient to a surgery center . " As a result , Mr. Cosgrove is more cautious than most about the company 's potential for earnings growth . " It 's a slow iirocess , " he says .
