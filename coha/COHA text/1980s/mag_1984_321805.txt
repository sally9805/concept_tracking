The President 's triumph ranks with the biggest ever <P> For an utterly predictable election , it managed to generate surprising suspense and even a bit of tension at the very end . Not about who would win , of course , or even whether it might be close ; the public opinion polls had pretty well answered that . Rather , the question was whether Ronald Reagan would win re-election by a historic landslide . The verdict came almost the moment the count began : a resounding yes . <P> On television maps it showed up as a tide of blue ( or red , depending on the network ) rolling inexorably south to north , east to west , and as a vaulting column of electoral votes for Reagan towering over a nearly invisible stack for Democratic Challenger Walter Mondale . Partisans on both sides were awestruck . " Embarrassing , just embarrassing , " muttered Mondale 's campaign manager , Robert Beckel . Democrat Nancy Dick , conceding defeat in her bid for a Senate seat from Colorado , lamented , " My loss is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In the Reagan camp , Pollster Richard Wirthlin crowed early in the evening , " If these numbers hold , it 's not just a landslide . The whole mountain will have moved . " <P> The numbers in the end did not hold up quite that well , but almost . Reagan failed by an eyelash to get the 50-state sweep he had aimed for , but he carried 49 states , only the second time that has been done ( Richard Nixon was first in 1972 ) . <P> Reagan 's margin , 525 electoral votes to 13 for Mondale , was exceeded in modern times only by Franklin D. Roosevelt 's 523-to-8 crushing of Alf Landon in 1936. * As of Wednesday morning , Reagan was winning 59% of the popular vote , a share not much below Lyndon Johnson 's record 61.1% in 1964 . Ironically , Reagan came close to the 63% vote garnered two days earlier by the Marxist Sandinistas in a Nicaraguan election that Washington had denounced as rigged . Mondale was left with ten electoral votes from his home state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 41% share of the popular vote was little more than Republican Barry Goldwater won in 1964 or Democrat George McGovern in 1972 . <P> The Republican surge was so all embracing as to make almost superfluous the elaborate demographic analyses conducted by political experts . Mondale won an overwhelming percentage of blacks , and thinner majorities among Jewish voters , union households and those earning less than $10,000 a year . Period . Reagan took everything else , sweeping every imaginable category of voter : young , middle-aged and elderly ; low , middle and high income ; Protestant and Roman Catholic ; professional and blue collar . <P> Yes , and women too . Before the polls opened , the campaign 's chief claim to a place in the history books had been the Democrats ' nomination of Geraldine Ferraro for Vice President . But the presence of a woman on a major party 's national ticket for the first time did not widen the gender gap . Polls of people leaving the voting booths indicated that some 54% of female voters pulled the lever for Reagan . That did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male voters . But it indicated that if the election had been conducted solely among women , Reagan would still have won-big.
