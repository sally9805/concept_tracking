Insurance Underwriter Joann Murphy moved to Oak Brook , Ill. , 25 years ago " for the quiet and the country . " But now her home in Du Page County is bracketed by office buildings and a huge shopping mall . A 31-story tower obliterates the view of trees and grass from her windows ; its construction , still in progress , has sent clouds of dust and bursts of noise into her home . Laments Murphy : " This is like living in downtown Chicago . " <P> Well , not exactly . If Du Page and dozens of other fast-growing counties all over the U.S. are beginning to look like spread-out cities , most of their residents can still loll in a hammock in a spacious backyard on a late-spring evening . But these counties are hardly suburbs anymore , at least in the traditional sense of being bedroom communities for nearby cities . Not only jobs but also gourmet restaurants and chic stores are close at hand . As a result , people like Engineer Daniel Nee , a resident of Gwinnett County , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months or more without feeling any necessity to take their families downtown . <P> What are these places then ? They are a form of urban organization  --  or , sometimes , disorganization  --  so new that demographers have not yet coined an accepted name for them . But outside almost every major American city , one or more counties are developing the characteristics of Du Page or Gwinnett or Fairfax County , Va. , across the Potomac from Washington , or Orange County , between Los Angeles and San Diego , or Johnson County , Kans. , next to Kansas City . These sprawling , increasingly dense suburbs might be called megacounties . <P> Nowadays they are where the growth is  --  in population , construction , jobs , incomes . Gwinnett County 's population has almost quadrupled , from 72,300 in 1970 to 250,000 today ; since 1984 it has been the fastest-growing county in the nation . Oakland County , near Detroit , has got 40% of all jobs created in Michigan since the 1982 recession . Tysons Corner , an unincorporated area of Fairfax County 13 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a gas station ; today it contains more office space than either Baltimore or downtown Miami . The Corporate Woods office complex in Overland Park , Kans. , boasts 275 businesses and 5,000 jobs ; built on 300 acres , it has room for more . " Corporate Woods is the fastest-growing commercial area in either state , Kansas or Missouri , " says Planning Consultant Myles Schachter . <P> $ It is less sheer growth than the type of growth , however , that has given the megacounties their distinguishing mark of self-sufficiency . The first great wave of American suburbanization that began right after World War II was a migration of the middle class from the cities to newly created bedroom communities . But for the past dozen years or so , that movement has been immensely reinforced by a flight of jobs following the people . It is being powered by some of the mightiest currents in modern life : the communications revolution and the switch from a manufacturing to a service economy . Says George Sternlieb , professor of city planning at Rutgers University : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible a life-style that could only be dreamt about a few years ago . "
