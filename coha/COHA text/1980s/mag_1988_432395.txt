 | Isabella Rossellini is probably the world 's most famous ? and maybe highest paid ? model . Her fabulous face , with its mixture of freshness , sensuality and luminescence has helped boost the sales of LancSme cosmetics 25 percent a year since 1982 . But Rossellini 's movie career has been rougher , littered with duds like " White Nights " and " Tough Guys Do n't Dance . " The exception was her 1986 succes de scandale in David Lynch 's controversial " Blue Velvet . " As the vulnerable , masochistic nightclub singer , Ingrid Bergman 's dark-eyed daughter won both praise for her courage and criticism for participating in such harrowing scenes as the ritualistic rape at the hands of the psychopath played by Dennis Hopper . In another shocking moment , she emerged from shrubbery , naked and bruised , desperate for help . " I loved the film , " says Rossellini , " but the consequences were almost too high a price to pay ? the criticism of it , the talking about it and trying to explain yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed , is here in the form of " Zelly and Me . " In this low-budget film , Rossellini , 35 , blossoms in her best performance yet as the charming , compassionate French nanny to a poor little rich girl ( Alexandra Johnes ) . Beneath the film 's surface , as genteel and polished as old family silver , is an undercurrent of secret violence ? but unlike " Blue Velvet , " it is psychological , not physical , and Rossellini is the rescuer , not the victim . Her charge , Phoebe , is an orphan in the care of a rich grandmother ( Glynis Johns ) ? a lonely , possessive woman who loves the child but is determined to break her willful spirit . Rossellini as Zelly is the empathetic counterpoint , but she is not flawless ? her attraction to child 's play is her escape from reality . Even her love affair with a man on a neighboring estate ( David Lynch in his acting debut ) turns out to be based on fantasy . Made under the auspices of David Puttnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Zelly and Me " is an impressive debut for writer-director Tina Rathborne . Rathborne , 37 , a graduate of Harvard and Columbia , admits the movie is " semiautobiographical " ? though the grandmother who raised her after she was orphaned , she says , was nothing like the one in the film . From the start , Rathborne wanted Rossellini " because of her warmth , down to earthness and depth of feeling , " says the director . " She 's very funny , too ? she has a gooney side and a witty kind of body and face . I wanted to tap into that . " Especially endearing are Rossellini 's scenes with Lynch , her off-screen love . " I never @#  | thought I 'd like Isabella as much as I liked her in Blue Velvet ' " he says . " But this in many ways is her best work . It may have been a more natural role for her . " Working with Rathborne had strange echoes with Rossellini 's past . When she saw a TV drama Rathborne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spare style reminded her a bit of her father , the great Italian realist director Roberto Rossellini . The camera moved when it was necessary , ? never to entertain your eyes , " recalls Isabella in the lilting accent that sometimes sounds exactly like her famous mother 's . When she learned that one of the themes in " Zelly " is the child 's fascination with the story of Joan of Arc , she was stunned . " My mother , like Phoebe , was an orphan , " says Rossellini , " and she had kind of an obsession with Joan of Arc . " Ingrid Bergman played Joan of Arc several times , on the stage and in two films . At the top : Isabella , her twin sister , Ingrid , and their older brother , Robertino , grew up mostly in Rome after their parents split up when the twins were five . ( Today Ingrid , who is divorced , lives in New York with a son ; Robertino is a stockbroker in Monte Carlo . ) Isabella came to New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her first small role was in one of her mother 's worst movies , " A Matter of Time . " She started modeling late , when she was 28 , but oegan at the top , with a Vogue cover . Then came the lucrative Lancome deal ; her current contract is reportedly worth more ? than $2 million over four years . Rossellini turns out to be neither a crazy child of showbiz nor an airhead . She 's not one to fuss : no jewelry , little makeup ( " I like red lipstick because it 's cheerful " ) and hair cut in a plain bob . Photographer Francesco Scavullo loves the look : " Very , very clean skin and she just looks like a fabulous Italian girl . " Ever since Rossellini caught a glimpse of her Lancome boss 's closet while at his house for a dinner party ? it contained all gray suits and six identical pairs of shoes ? she 's pared her wardrobe to an enviable simplicity , everything in black and gray . She must exercise because of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoliosis and spent 18 months in a body cast . Growing up around film sets , with family friends such as Federico Fellini and Vittorio De Sica , Rossellini has naturally been attracted to directors . " I once fell in love with a physicist ! " she swears ) . Divorced from director Martin Scorsese and from Jonathan Wiedemann , an aspiring filmmaker , her current romance @# with Lynch is bicoastal . " It 's difficult but David wants to live in Hollywood , " she says . " I have my daughter in New York . " ( She and Wiedemann split the care of their child , Elettra Ingrid , four . ) Rossellini and Lynch talk for hours on the phone about movies ? he has a small part for her in his next film , " Ronnie Rocket , " which he 's trying to finance . The death of both parents ? her father in 1977 , her mother in 1982 ? is still painful , and it 's hard for her to watch her mother 's late films . Once in West Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lynch , her hosts surprised her by playing a rediscovered taped interview of her mother . When she heard the voice , its hesitations and giggles , she froze : " For others she 's a star , for me she 's my mother . " Sunnier outlook : If Rossellini resembles Bergman , she has her father 's sunnier Italian outlook . " Once in a while I get very depressed ? I say it 's my Swedish days , " she says . " She laughs constantly , " says her friend and " White Nights " costar , Mikhail Baryshnikov . " She tells very funny stories from her childhood with a very appealing rhythm , a sort of Italian crescendo . She 's a very happy person . " " My way of exorcising fear is to understand , " says Rossellini , explaining her constant analyzing of people and roles . " She has the ability to go into the mind of the character , " says Lynch . " She really has this love of psychology and why people do what they do . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather go to the extremes of human behavior . But Isabella likes to get to the basic truth . " This may exempt her from classic Hollywood material . " I think I would be intimidated to play a very sexy , attractive , seductive lady , " she says with a sly smile , " if they do n't give me the reasons . If this woman is very attractive , seductive ? well , is she insecure ? Why is she so forward with men ? She 's obviously having a problem . " Truth-seeking , of course , extends even to herself . " Oh , yes , I analyze myself ? but I see an analyst for those few things I deny ! " she says , and lets out her sunny little Italian laugh .
