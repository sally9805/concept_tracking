txt If the Soviets are able to perform a miracle of missiles , they have a somewhat different problem with the more traditional miracle of the loaves . No matter how they juggle the statistics and fiddle with the figures , they can not seem to make wheat grow . Yet they try . Figures on grain production presented to the Supreme Soviet by planning boss Nikolai Baibakov showed a 12 per cent increase in grain production during the current five-year period , as compared with the last five-year period . That seemed fairly good . However , kremlinologists took out their pocket calculators and their copies of the Soviet Statistical Yearbook and calculated that this year 's crop was only 181 million tons , 55 million tons below plan . That is not quite catastrophic , but it certainly is no miracle . It means that the Soviets will have to import vast amounts of grain from the West or else present their people with severe shortages of meat and milk , and perhaps even a shortage of loaves . The obvious source of imports is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exporter . We have sus pended grain exports because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , of course ; but there has been strong pressure from farmers to get the embargo lifted , and Ronald Reagan has promised to do just that if he is elected . It would be a mistake , however , to present the Soviets with that particular miracle . It is also unnecessary . The U.S. farm belt has suffered its own crop troubles because of the summer drought , and will not have as much grain to export as expected . And to make up for the loss of their Soviet customers because of the embargo , they now have the Peoples Republic of China , which has agreed to buy between six and nine million tons of grain a year from the United States over the next four years . That will not fully make up the loss in Soviet sales , which would have been around 17 million tons this year . But there are other countries than China that need to import grain  --  crops worldwide have been mediocre , creating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to keep the embargo In effect  --  to tell the Soviets that they can eat our bread or they can eat Afghanistan , but they ca n't have both .
