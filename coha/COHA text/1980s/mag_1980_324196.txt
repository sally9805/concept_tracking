HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS by Joanne Greenberg <P> Holt , Rinehart &; Winston ; 194 pages ; $9.95 <P> In this collection of ten short stories , Joanne Greenberg seems eager to make things go bump in the daytime . Take the case of Aunt Bessie , a nice Jewish woman who one day stops believing in God . Watched by a cautiously admiring niece , Bessie goes on to renounce faith in banks , germs and electricity , although her unplugged television set somehow still carries whatever programs she wants to watch . Only when Bessie decides that all natural laws , including gravity , are myths does she receive her alarmingly literal comeuppance . Her niece finds her floating like a balloon about the house , being hectored and scolded by mysteriously televised rabbis . She pleads her disbelief , to no avail . " Foolish woman , " a rabbi replies , " a soul goes in and out of belief a hundred times a day . Belief is too fragile to weigh a minute on . You stopped running after Him , looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned from ! " <P> Although the whimsy in this story is nicely done , Bessie 's punishment strikes a censorious note that is less happily picked up throughout the book . Greenberg draws a number of characters only so that she can quarter them . A young man smuggles cocaine from Mexico into the U.S. and meets up with a malakh , a Jewish angel who subjects him to humiliating lectures : " Whenever the Lord has been convinced to widen His mercy or extend His patience it has been at the behest of a fool . You are such a fool . " <P> In other tales , a couple trying to submerge their heritage in a Wasp suburb are threatened by an old yenta ; if they do not give money to her charities , she will expose them to the smothering tolerance and curiosity of the Christian community . " On Passover , " she warns , " you will be the Jew on the fellowship committee ; you will explain in the schools , you will explain in the churches , you will bare your souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " And a mother meditates caustically on the thought processes of her two teen-age children : " Instant communication , total openness , family life and sex ed. at school , and now everyone knows everything in a pop-psych , literal , pea-brained way . " <P> A reader may agree wholeheartedly with such statements and still have an uneasy feeling . Greenberg displays little of the sympathy she expended on the mentally ill in I Never Promised You a Rose Garden ( 1964 ) and on the deaf in In This Sign ( 1972 ) . People in these stories are self-maimed , and get treated accordingly . The artistic regimen is ascetic . " Talmudic Law , " one of her characters explains , " forbids the overdecorated letter , a letter for art 's sake and not for the formation of legible words . " Nothing is overdecorated here ; Greenberg spends little time telling where her characters live or what they look like . In one story , a parent complains about a wayward son , but it is impossible to tell whether the speaker is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
