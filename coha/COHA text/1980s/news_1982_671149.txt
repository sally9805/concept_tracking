" It ' s not a referendum on Reaganomics or anything , " said Ed Weber , a freshman Republican Congressman from Toledo , a normally Democratic slice of Ohio now reeling from the auto industry ' s problems. // " I think it ' s individual against individual , candidate against candidate , " Mr. Weber said . " I think it ' s a referendum on whether I ' ve done the things I was elected to do . I come home every weekend . I know people appreciate that I ' m in touch with the voters . I don ' t want people to think I ' ve sold my soul to Ronald Reagan. " // Moderate Republican senators such as John C. Danforth of Missouri , David Durenburger of Minnesota , John H. Chafee of Rhode Island , Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut , and Robert T. Stafford of Vermont , fearful that they may become the political victims of voter dissatisfaction with the economy and Mr. Reagan ' s policies , have been stressing differences with the White House and playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Label // Despite the President ' s drive to cut social programs in favor of increased military spending , Republican candidates are taking a different tack . From West Virginia to Oregon and from Michigan to California , at the same time they boast about their party ' s success in cutting taxes and slowing the growth of government , they increasingly stress their ability to deliver services and federally financed projects for their districts . As they seek political distance from Mr. Reagan , they soft-pedal their party label when they attack their Democratic opponents , // Some now even join Democrats in favoring job-creation bills or suggesting that the White House is pushing military spending too far too fast. // Many are following the advice of one Republican campaign consultant , who has detected signs of a public shift toward Democrats . As quoted by a Pennsylvania Republican , he counseled : " Stick to local issues . Don ' t get dragged into defending the President . Stick to promoting your own accomplishments . Don ' t lean on rhetoric like ' stay the course . ' And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political strategists call this " the fiefdom strategy , " meaning that they encourage Republicans to identify closely with their own districts while national party advertising urges voters to " stay the course " with the Reagan program . Democratic candidates call it " Republican schizophrenia. " // The Democratic tactic has been the opposite : to link Republican incumbents to Reagan policies , the recession , and 10. 1 percent nationwide unemployment and local layoffs , bankruptcies or farm foreclosures . <> <> He ' Asked for a Referendum ' // " The President is asking for a referendum and he ' s going to get it , " said Peter D. Hart , a leading Democratic poll taker . " He didn ' t need to go that far . The biggest cost to him is giving up the Presidency to act as the leader of the Republican Party. " // In a Massachusetts battle between two incumbents , the liberal Democrat , Barney Frank , has persistently attacked Margaret M. Heckler , a seven-term Republican moderate , for supporting Reagan tax and budget cuts in 1981 . Tying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hecklereaganomics. " // " My opponent chooses to run against the President , " responds Mrs. Heckler , who has clashed with the White House this year over cuts in social programs and who has lately tried to focus attention on votes by Mr. Frank in the state Legislature on pornography and prostitution . " As proud as I am to be a Republican , " she asserts , " I am unbossed , I am unbought , and a very independent Heckler. " // In Lansing , Mich. , home of Michigan State , Representative Jim Dunn , a conservative Republican who steadily backed the President in 1981 , defensively describes himself as " fair , strong and independent " and as a principal protector of student aid programs against Reagan cuts . " I do not support Reagan economics , I support Michigan economics , " he says. // In eastern Pennsylvania , another conservative Republican freshman , Jim Coyne , uses his television ads to emphasize personal efforts to obtain local flood disaster relief and $5 million in subsidies for steelworkers laid off because of foreign imports. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Michael Staton , Republican freshmen who won seats long held by Democrats , put their main line of defense on constituent service . " Denny Smith did what he promised to do : to return to Oregon and hold town meetings , " said Greg Walden , Mr. Smith ' s campaign manager . " He ' s held 55 town meetings in two years. " // At a press conference and later at a fund-raising dinner Tuesday in northern New Jersey , not only the incumbent Republican Congressman , Harold C. Hollenbeck , but Vice President Bush avoided using Mr. Reagan ' s theme of " staying the course . " In his campaign handouts , Mr. Hollenbeck stresses that he fought for $2. 2 million for a New Jersey rail maintenance facility , resisted the transfer of a New Jersey office of the Federal Aviation Administration , and worked for " new , safe affordable senior citizen housing " in various communities. // In spite of Republican efforts to defuse the unemployment issue and diffuse economic fears and frustrations , President Reagan and his program are a hovering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Visit // This is enough of a political liability that Republican strategists privately acknowledge that very few Republican campaigns want a Presidential visit in the homestretch. // " A month ago , the President was picking and choosing where he was going to dine , " commented one Republican campaign consultant who asked to remain anonymous . " But now he ' s finding out that his invitations to dance are not being picked up. " // Republican strategists are so uncertain now about " the Reagan factor " that advisers to the Republican gubernatorial nominee in California , state Attorney General George Deukmejian , asked the White House last week to have the President forgo a planned political trip. // Another indication of the shifting public mood from a year ago is the degree to which Democratic candidates feel free to attack Reagan proposals for accelerated military spending and the defensive echo of Republican candidates that the Pentagon budget must be carefully scrutinized to cut the " waste and fat " or else that it must be included in across-the-board budget cuts. // Representative Paul S. Trible Jr. of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running for the Senate , has taken to straddling on the military budget even though his home region includes the naval shipyards at Newport News . " We need to do more - we need to make up for a decade of neglect , " he told the Alexandria Chamber of Commerce . But he hastened to caution : " I don ' t think we can throw money at defense. " // Even in the pro-military constituencies of Texas , a Republican aspirant like Jim Bradshaw , running in a new district around Fort Worth , says money can be saved by close scrutiny of the Pentagon budget. // In New Jersey , Representative Hollenbeck repeatedly stressed the amendment he offered this year to cut back the pace of President Reagan ' s proposed increases in military spending . Mr. Hollenbeck said that his own polls showed that voters favored slowing down and that fewer than 20 percent backed " drastic increases. " // In areas where Democratic voters outnumber registered Republicans , Republican candidates have for years soft-pedaled their party label . Many are doing it this year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan connection but also to make a traditional appeal across party lines. // Senator Harrison Schmitt of New Mexico , the Republican incumbent in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans roughly 2 to 1 , offered a simple explanation for why he and many others leave their party affiliation out. // " There ' s no need to beat your Democratic friends over the head with the fact that you ' re asking them to vote Republican , " he said. //
