The hijackers commandeered an American plane and couched their demands in anti-American , Islamic rhetoric . But their goals involved Israel , too. // The hijackers demanded that Israel release more than 700 Shiite Lebanese prisoners it is holding . They also demanded that Israel fully withdraw from Lebanon and dismantle the South Lebanon Army , a militia it funds and arms. // // Israel found itself in the painful position of having to decide whether to free the Shiite prisoners to save the lives of the American hostages remaining on board the commandeered flight. // Israeli experts on terrorism said Sunday that Israel ' s moral position was compromised by its own release last month of 1 , 150 prisoners - including terrorists - in exchange for three Israeli prisoners of war. // The experts said that Israel can expect to have more confrontations with the Lebanese Shiites , who gained enormous political and military clout in Lebanon during Israel ' s three-year occupation. // Dr. Ariel Merari , an expert in the psychology of terrorism at Tel Aviv University , said that the demands made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jihad ( Islamic Holy War ) organization . Islamic Jihad is believed to be an umbrella for extremist , fundamentalist groups that have varying degrees of connection with Iran. // Islamic Jihad claimed responsiblity for the hijacking in a phone call to a news agency Friday , then disclaimed responsibility 24 hours later. // ' ' The 24-hour difference is significant , ' ' said Dr. Merari . ' ' I believe the Iranians were afraid of creating a pretext for American retaliation. ' ' // The Reagan administration has in the past said it would retaliate for terrorist attacks on American citizens . The problem in the case of the latest hijacking , another Israeli expert on terrorism said , is that ' ' there is no address. ' ' // An official curtain of silence descended in Israel as the hijacking drama unfolded . Sunday , the Cabinet met and was briefed by Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin . Prime Minister Shimon Peres instructed ministers to keep silent on the crisis. // A deadline the hijackers had set for the release of the prisoners came and went with no Israeli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hijackers had said they would allow Red Cross officials on board the aircraft in Beirut to help the passengers if Israel and the United States agreed in principle to their demand that 50 Arab prisoners be immediately freed from Israeli jails. // There were reportedly as many as 12 gunmen aboard the TWA flight Sunday , after it had shuttled four times between Algiers and Beirut . It was believed that between 30 and 40 passengers - all American men - remained on the flight , which originally carried 153 persons . Up to 12 passengers with Jewish-sounding last names were believed to have been forced off the plane in Beirut Saturday night . It was not immediately known where they were taken , or who held them. // In the past , Israel has taken an uncompromising stand toward terrorists . It has insisted that no deals should be made that would allow terrorists to emerge victorious from hostage situations . That position is backed by the United States. // The Israeli government was widely criticized - both in Israel and internationally - last month when it agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Palestine Liberation Organization headed by Ahmed Jibril. // Anti-terrorist experts in Israel at the time warned that the exchange would be interpreted as a softening of Israel ' s stance and would lead to further kidnappings and demands. // ' ' There is a definite connection with the prisoner exchange , ' ' said Yoram Schweitzer , a researcher with the terrorism research project at Tel Aviv University . ' ' Israel is vulnerable to such demands because it broke its tough position . Even if the hijackers don ' t achieve their goal of freeing the prisoners , they will gain other benefits - from the harm this will do to Israel in American public opinion. ' ' // The hijacking plunged Israel ' s government from one embarrassing and sensitive dilemma in Lebanon into another . Just Saturday , the South Lebanon Army ( SLA ) , Israel ' s policeman in the four- to nine-mile-wide ' ' security zone ' ' above the border in Lebanon , finally released 21 Finnish soldiers of the United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon. // The Finns had been held for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained and armed by Israel . The SLA alleged that the Finnish UN troops had disarmed 11 SLA soldiers and allowed them to be captured by Amal , the Shiite militia that dominates south Lebanon. // The 21 Finns were released only after the 11 SLA militiamen , all of whom were Shiites , wrote letters to SLA commander Antoine Lahad , saying they did not wish to return to the SLA. // Although Israel tried to distance itself from the incident , it was held responsible both by the Finnish government and UN Undersecretary General Brian Urquhart , who personally negotiated the Finns ' release last week. // Mr. Urquhart had suggested to reporters that the UN forces in Lebanon would consider using military force to free the Finns if Israel was unable to persuade the SLA to release them. // Both the Finnish incident and the hijacking indicate Israel ' s vulnerability as it hesitates over how to deal with the continuing threat from southern Lebanon. // Israel has all but left Lebanon , although it continues to patrol in the narrow security zone . Israeli officials say their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many factions are active just across the border , the Israelis are inclined to maintain some sort of control that will allow them to retaliate quickly against terrorist attacks . But , as Urquhart argued to Defense Minister Rabin and other officials last week , Israeli troops and the SLA are acting as a magnet , focusing the attention of various extremist groups. // The Israelis fear that if they pull out completely and abandon the SLA , if will be more difficult for them to strike across the border and protect their northern settlements . UN officials and many Israeli military experts argue , to the contrary , that only by complete withdrawal will Israel deflect the wrath of most of the mainstream Shiites. // Amal , the mainstream militia run by Lebanese Cabinet minister Nabih Berri , stands a better chance of controlling Shiite extremists if the Israelis withdraw , these experts argue. // The rise of terrorist cells in Lebanon like Islamic Jihad accelerated in the wake of both the Iranian revolution and the Israeli invasion of Lebanon . Israeli - and American - soldiers became easy targets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawal , a power vacuum has occurred in Beirut and southern Lebanon . Syria , which had policed much of this region before the 1982 Israeli invasion , still dominates the Bekaa valley but has not moved back into the Beirut environs from which these terrorist cells mainly appear to spring. // The PLO , which once also controlled the Beirut region , was routed by the Israelis - and its remnants have been attacked by Syria , Palestinian splinter groups , and , most recently , by Shiite militias. // In this anarchic environment , forces like the Islamic Jihad operate with impunity . <> <> WA Flight 847 - chronology of a hijack // 9 a. m .
