Japan 's Tora-San films stretch on and on and on <P> Hollywood in 1983 will be banking heavily on sequels , everything from The Sting II and Porky 's II : The Next Day to Superman III and The Revenge of the Jedi . But it will take a long time to catch up to the Japanese . While crowds are still lining up to see the newest sequel in the Tora-San film series , No . XXX to be exact , they can already start thinking about XXXI and XXXII , both of which will be out before the end of the year . <P> As was the case with I through XXIX , No . XXX has the same basic cast and follows the same basic plot : the half-sad , half-funny adventures of a middle-aged ne'er-do-well through a bustling modern-day Japan . The collective title of the series is A Man 's Life Is Tough , but Get Out Your Handkerchiefs might be more apt . <P> Tora-San is a peddler who hawks his wares at local fairs around the country . He spends the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop in Tokyo 's working-class Shibamata district and do little else but eat noodles , prepare to eat noodles or sit around the noodle table . He almost always wears the same outfit , a double-breasted check suit flapping open without a tie , and a green hat . He is a boor , and he treats his long-suffering family like servants . But the Japanese , who know all about pearl fishing , believe that beneath that crusty shell is a treasure of kindness and concern . <P> In each of the films , Tora-San ( Kiyoshi Atsumi ) falls in love with a handsome woman . At the end it does n't work out for one reason or another . He always looks as if his heart will break , and audiences all over Japan cry on cue . Since the first movie was introduced in 1969 , an estimated 40 million people have been drawn to that familiar story , and 4 million more are expected to see the latest , which opened in theaters just before New Year 's . Atsumi , 54 , has become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is considered a true success until she has played a Tora-San heroine . <P> By Hollywood standards , the latest Tora-San budget , $1.6 million , would fall under the heading " Etc . " Yet the one now playing , in which Tora-San plays a Nipponese Cyrano de Bergerac , is almost certain to gross $8 million . <P> If the plot sounds as if it was borrowed from television , the reason is simple : it was . Tora-San began in 1968 as a TV series , but failed to impress network executives . When Tora-San dropped dead after being bitten by a snake , infuriated fans clogged switchboards in protest . The chief fan was Director Yoji Yamada , 51 , who persuaded a reluctant film company to let him make just one Tora-San film for general release . <P> That snake venom should be patented . The picture proved such an instantaneous hit that Yamada was ordered to turn out three more in four months . Since then the pace has slowed , and dedicated Tora-trekkies know that their hero will visit once in August and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they are made , the movies are surprisingly polished . After so much time on the assembly lines , the actors are pros , and Yamada keeps the action moving smartly .
