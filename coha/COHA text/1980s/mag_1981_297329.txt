Associate Editor Richard Corliss was 16 years old when a viewing of Ingmar Bergman 's The Seventh Seal in Corliss 's native Philadelphia transformed a budding romance with film into a serious relationship . " I had grown up thinking of movies as something to eat popcorn with , " says Corliss . " Bergman and the other European directors were the first ones to open my eyes to film as art . " Though Corliss has since cut down on popcorn , his taste for movies has broadened to include " mass " as well as " class " films by directors in all parts of the world . His experience as a film reviewer has also broadened . Before coming to TIME as a film and television critic in June 1980 , he worked as a reviewer for the National Review , New Times magazine , Maclean 's and the Soho Weekly News . <P> Corliss , who views more than 500 films a year , is dismayed by what he sees as the " new conventionality and conformity " of the film industry . Says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which means pandering to a younger audience with a taste for romantic comedies and slick horror films . At the current rate , senility should hit Hollywood about March of 1990 . " When he is not reviewing for TIME , Corliss is busy preparing new issues of Film Comment , a bimonthly journal ( circ. 30,000 ) that he has edited since 1970 . He has also written two books : Talking Pictures and Greta Garbo . Once a year , Corliss interrupts his hectic schedule to serve on the selection committee for the New York Film Festival , which means screening as many as 200 films over a period of seven weeks . " Film festivals are usually part summer camp and part penal camp , " he says . " But it helps to know that amid the rubbish , it is still possible to recognize a truly fine film when it surfaces . " <P> In his three-page contribution to this week 's cover package on Actress Meryl Streep , Corliss delved into the literary and structural artifices that characterize her new movie The French Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cover story on the prime-time television soap opera Dallas , found Harold Pinter 's transmutation of John Fowles ' multilayered novel into a film-within-a-film a challenging experiment . Concludes Corliss : " Because of its complexity and cerebral detachment , The French Lieutenant 's Woman is a difficult film to fall in love with-but the performance by Streep is not . It marks the coming of age of a potentially great screen actress . "
