So when U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko exchanged pleasantries at the start of their long-anticipated meeting last week , the talk quite naturally turned to the weather . " You have to come to the U.S. to find out how cold this winter is , " said Shultz . The Soviet diplomat was quick with a comeback . " I 've read all about it , " replied Gromyko .

Sorting through the confusing mix of mild words and harsh retorts , diplomats at the 35-nation conference were left wondering what the next move could be in the fumbling superpower two-step .
