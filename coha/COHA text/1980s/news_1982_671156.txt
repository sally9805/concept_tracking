If his hunch is right , he will change the direction of sportswear , which has long been a pillar of the American fashion establishment . In the last decade his clothes , along with those of a handful of other sportswear designers , including Ralph Lauren and Perry Ellis , have become the symbol of American style . Mr. Ellis was whimsical and Mr. Lauren ' s collection is still to come. // Mr. Klein ' s showing yesterday - in an atmosphere as tense as at any of the French fashion presentations , which self-consciously aim at affecting the course of fashion - exchanged the wind-swept , nomakeup look of athletic , casual women for a more contrived , sophisticated style . Most of the models wore hats and high-heeled pumps or ankle-strap shoes . They also wore leather gloves and masses of jewelry , and inexplicably carried handkerchiefs that floated at their fingertips . The handkerchiefs , which picked up the dotted pattern of the blouses , were symbolic . Along with the watch fobs that looped from the lapel pin to the breast pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of Mr. Klein ' s new look for women for spring is a short jacket with a double row of buttons the size of quarters ; it is usually paired with a skinny , short skirt , but can also be worn with trousers . For evening , there are strapless tops , satin tunics with flaring peplums , beaded butterflies at the waistline and bodices paved in rhinestones. // " The whole feeling of sportswear has changed , " the designer said after the show . " It is no longer unconstructed jackets . " The jacket , he went on , is " the pivotal part " of the outfit for day , determining the choice of blouse and skirt or pants . The success of more elaborately styled jackets in his fall collection gave him the confidence to continue the same theme for spring . The change in his style , he insisted , was heralded by the clothes for fall , which are now in the stores. // He acknowledged that the emphasis on accessories was a key part of his look . Hats , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " I am seeing more women wearing hats , " he observed . As for shoes , " I don ' t like flats at all - for me , women look beautiful in high heels. " // Though the clothes look constricting - a pleated silk choker circles the neckline of many blouses , over a collar that rises still higher - he insists they are comfortable . " Ask the models , " he said . " They will tell you they ' re not uncomfortable . The jackets aren ' t restrictive , and the skirts usually are buttoned up the side . I like to leave the last button open , but you could also open two buttons if you need more room to walk . " Not all the skirts are skinny , he adds . He also does some full styles in black linen " to provide a choice. " // Still , the freewheeling , un-self-conscious look associated with sportswear has been replaced by a more studied and more formal style , which has more in common with what is going on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look of American separates . In addition to suits , Mr. Klein showed many more dresses than he usually does , some in flower prints , others in white pique . When they have flaring tops , snugly belted waistlines above flaring peplums and short skirts that are wrapped in front to bare the knees , they go beyond mere seductiveness. // " American design started with sportswear , " he said . " The world looked to us for easy , uncontrived clothes . Now women are ready for clothes that look more designed , that have more excitement . Clothes have to be bright , alive , snappy and sophisticated if people are to buy them in today ' s economy. " // If he is right , and people are longing for a more formal way of dressing , it will not be the first time he has changed his style . He began as a coat and suit designer , opening his own company in 1967 . After a few years , observing the popularity of more casual clothes , he switched to sportswear , emphasizing simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensing a change , he paid more attention to suits than he usually does. // " Everything is still made as separates , " he said . " Any of the jackets can be worn with any of the skirts or pants . There are plenty of cashmere sweaters , as well as blouses to go with them . That is the essence of sportswear . It ' s just that the styles have changed. " // Not all the seasonal changes in the spring fashion shows were that dramatic . Diane Von Furstenberg , who scored a big success a decade ago with a simple wrapped dress that flattered most figures , has expanded her repertory enormously . She has a vast assortment of colorful prints involving such combinations as orange , turquoise and brown in bold tropical designs ; full skirts hiked up to show white petticoats , and trousers of all lengths . The idea , she says , is to be able to carry a change of clothes in an attache case . She makes it all seem possible. // Betty Hanson continues the sportswear look along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrates on white linen , with a soup , con of beige and some pale , washed blues , and makes his basic , somewhat familiar shapes come alive . The blouses are often the core of his assemblages , to which vests or three-quarter coats are often added . Knee- or calf-length skirts alternate with trousers for day , and sprays of beads decorate evening styles , which are in the same easy , casual shapes as the day clothes . Some abstract art motifs decorate white crepe blouses or crepe dresses in a lively , contemporary manner. //
