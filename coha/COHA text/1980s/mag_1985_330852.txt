Star Wars , arms control , the military budget . Name the subject and the Pentagon 's response is to stress its responsibility to counter actual and potential Soviet threats . Over coffee with editors of TIME last week , Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger expounded on that view in detail . Excerpts : <P> On the Soviet Star Wars program . They spend at least as much on defense as they do on offense ; we think a little more . We know that they have not only done a lot of research , but done some testing and development in the use of lasers for the destruction of missiles , and we have not . I think they want to maintain a monopoly . ( Soviet Leader Mikhail ) Gorbachev said almost as much in Paris . He said we have quite enough arms competition on the ground , and we do not want to have it in space . The President is aware that it could be destabilizing if you give one side a shield that the other could not penetrate , and therefore that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has said that if we find that we can do this , before we deploy we would share it with the world . What kind of world would it be if the Soviets get this without the slightest intention of sharing it with anybody ? <P> On the American SDI . We are making much greater progress than we anticipated . The barriers we saw to progress are crumbling . For one thing , we are making very great progress with being able to focus and project laser beams through conditions that used to distort them in the atmosphere . One reason this is expensive is that we are pursuing about five different methods of trying to destroy missiles outside the atmosphere . We are not working down one path and giving that up if it does not work . I think if the Soviets see that we are obdurate and not going to , as the President has said many times , take away this hope from the world , then maybe they will regroup and decide how much they want a reduction in offensive systems and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms-reduction offer presented last week in Geneva . There is finally a Soviet proposal . There has not been one for a long time , and so I think that is encouraging . But a great concern that I always had is that when you start out with an asymmetrical situation and you propose equal reductions , it still leaves the gap . Our proposals were sharp reductions that brought us down to parity . I do not think this Soviet proposal would do that . The other thing that I think is of concern is the composition of it . They would count everything , no matter where it was , that might hit the Soviet Union . They would not draw any distinction between aerial bombs and missiles . In order to get the reductions , we would be brought down very far below the number of their warheads . There is a limitation on range of cruise missiles that we would find very disadvantageous . Finally , I personally think what they intend is no new systems deployment permitted . The Soviets having deployed their new systems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Midgetman ) missile , the MX , the " Stealth " ( bomber ) .
