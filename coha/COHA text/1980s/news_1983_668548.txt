" I ' ll never forget it , " recalled Walpole boys ' soccer coach Lee Delaney . " It was my second game as coach . We ' d won the first game and we were leading Dedham , 1-0 , and looking to win . All of a sudden , this freshman kid comes streaking down the field and ties up the game with a bicycle kick goal . " He left his feet and kicked the ball over his head . We lost the game , and from that day on I knew who Tong Kun O was . He ' s haunted me ever since . " Those sentiments are prevalent around the Bay State League . Tong Kun O scored eight goals as a sophomore , and last year as a junior , he had 21 goals and nine assists and was voted the league ' s most valuable player and an EMass All-Star . " He ' s fast as lightning , " says Dedham coach Jake Santamaria . " One quick move and he ' s by the man covering him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really been keeping an eye out for him . " After the death of both his parents in 1978 , Kun O left Korea to live with his sister and brother-in-law . He did not play soccer or speak English until he arrived in this country , but he has done a remarkable job mastering both . Kun O claims that both have come easily to him . Although he may have a grammar problem now and then , soccer is a different story . Santamaria feels Kun O ' s athletic ability comes from his natural speed and coordination . Kun O also plays tennis , and Santamaria who doubles as tennis coach , says that Tong will be the No. 1 singles player this spring . " Usually , people who grew up playing soccer aren ' t that good with their hands , " said Santamaria . " But Tong has natural ability in tennis . " Kun O , 5-4 , credits his success on the soccer field to the hard work of his teammates . " Jay McHugh has taken some of the pressure off of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defensive play of fullbacks Rob Reynolds and Brian Keigan and halfback Mark Black have been a lot of help . " Dedham is 7-1-2 , largely without Kun O , who missed five games due to an ankle injury sustained against Wellesley . " He wanted to play so badly , " said Santamaria . " He couldn ' t even walk , but he was begging me to let him in . But it is great to see him back ; a part of Dedham is not on the field when Tong ' s not there . " I ' ve been around Tong for five years and really watched him mature . He ' s gotten physically stronger and a lot smarter . Soccer should be part of his life for quite a while . " Kun O is back , although heavily taped . He played in the team ' s 2- 1 victory against Norwood and was credited with an assist ( his fifth ) on the winning goal . " I think we will be contenders , " said Kun O. " Needham and Wellesley will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost to Bridgewater-Raynham in the semifinals ( 4-2 ) and they went on to win the tournament . " Kun O is optimistic that he will be playing soccer while majoring in computer science in college . " I think that Tong has a good future in soccer , " said Milton soccer coach Tom Herget . " Everytime he has the ball he ' s a nuisance . He ' s a very dangerous passer , I think it ' s his best feature . "
