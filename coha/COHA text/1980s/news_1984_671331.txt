But running Woodhull has been nearly as complicated as building it . In its first year of operation it failed two state medical inspections and suffered a string of technical problems and unforeseen structural renovations that have cost an extra $15 million to set right. // Patients have had to be transferred because too few beds are available , and it has been difficult to attract new people to the staff , according to senior doctors at the hospital. // Hospital officials say that the worst problems are over and that the city ' s newest public hospital has begun to offer the quality medical services to the impoverished neighborhoods of north Brooklyn that it was originally built to provide. // // ' This Is a Special Hospital ' // With 278 of its more than 600 planned beds open , Woodhull is still only working at about half speed . Senior hospital doctors say , however , that in October the hospital easily passed its third state inspection , and last month more than 11 , 000 patients went through its doors. // Woodhull , which its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambitious modern public health-care project , is a case study in the difficulty of converting a giant , technologically sophisticated medical facility into a working community hospital. // " This is a special hospital , " Dr. Eli A. Friedman , Woodhull ' s acting chief of medicine , said in an interview . " We are really trying to create a primary-care service to meet the needs of the urban poor. " // From the outside , Woodhull is impressive . A 10-story , 4-block-long , exposed-steel complex , it rises starkly above surrounding tenements at the intersection of Flushing Avenue and Broadway in the Williamsburg section . <> <> Emergency Room Rebuilt // But inside , Woodhull ' s combined linen- garbage chutes did not work when it first opened . The chutes were built at such a steep angle that the garbage bags broke when they were dropped in. // The emergency room was too small and had to be rebuilt . Special corridors divided into three lengthwise sections proved difficult to monitor , and the psychiatric ward ' s roof and windows were not secured against severely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of $5 million. // " It ' s like a car with all the options - there ' s more to break down , " said Thomas D. Ricke , a spokesman for the city ' s Health and Hospitals Corporation , which oversees the city ' s public hospital system. // The difficulties have delayed the opening of hospital wards and increased costs since staff and construction expenses still have to be paid at a time when the hospital does not have as many paying patients as it was budgeted for . Another consequence of the delays , senior doctors say , is that many patients have had to be transferred to Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn , // " There are far too many transfers because there aren ' t enough beds , " said Dr. Lewis R. Goldfrank , director of emergency medical service at Bellevue Hospital Center , who has been helping set up Woodhull ' s emergency service . " This has affected emergency service and morale. " // When it was planned in 1968 , Woodhull was to cost $85 million . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million . Unlike any other public hospital in the city , it was built to give every patient a private room . But the hospital staff soon discovered that there was virtually no space for nurses ' stations , doctors ' conference rooms or medicine storage cabinets. // They had to be created by converting former private rooms and fusing others into three-bed units . The result is a design that has begun to work , but now only 60 percent of the rooms are private . <> <> Problems With Security // Concern for security revealed another design flaw . Woodhull ' s corridors , as long as football fields , are hard to police , and several stairways lead outside the hospital . Carlos Loran , the hospital ' s executive director , said in an interview that microscopes , typewriters and up to 20 percent of the hospital ' s sheets had disappeared. // " It ' s a sieve - things walk , they walk , " Mr. Loran said . He has begun closing all nonessential stairways. // Almost all of Woodhull ' s patients come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely black and Hispanic Brooklyn neighborhoods of Williamsburg , Fort Greene , Bushwick , Greenpoint and part of Bedford-Stuyvesant. // For most inner-city residents , a visit to the doctor means a visit to the impersonal emergency room at a public hospital . Woodhull has tried to change that by assigning patients to a special team of doctors and nurses who continue to see them on subsequent visits . <> <> Hospital as ' Family Doctor ' // " We are trying to give people more attention , " said Robert M. Morrison , Woodhull ' s specialist on neighborhood clinics and family care . " This is a low-income area where we are most people ' s family doctor. " // Hospital officials say 74 percent of Woodhull ' s patients are now returning as planned to see their own doctors. // In a further effort to make a large , bureaucratized facility more accessible , two satellite clinics are taking medical care into local areas , especially helping the elderly who have difficulty traveling to the more distant hospital . Two more clinics are preparing to go into operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Thirty-seven percent of Woodhull ' s patients suffer from diabetes , one of the most common afflictions of the urban poor , according to Dr. Friedman . To meet the need , he has started a program to educate such patients . <> <> Community Advisory Board <> <> // Dr. Jay A. Sher , a co-director of the program , estimated that it would take three years to educate the community thoroughly on proper diabetes care . The program is designed to help prevent the kidney failure and blindness that can result when diabetes is not recognized early and properly treated , he said. // Woodhull officials also helped organize a community advisory board to answer questions and complaints , and to publicize the hospital ' s services . Iris N. Rodriguez , a member of the board who lives in Bushwick , said that there had been a small number of complaints about dirty corridors and long waits in the emergency room , but that they had been seen to promptly. // " I think the hospital ' s still in the womb , " Miss Rodriguez said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They ' re trying. " // Less effort would have been required , Dr. Friedman said , if Woodhull had not failed its first two state medical inspections . It was cited for poor record keeping and inadequate cleaning services , both consequences of rushing to open with a new staff and little preparation , hospital officials say . <> <> Communications Problems <> <> // " We held rallies to keep our spirits up , " recalled Dolores F. Jackson , the director of nursing. // Woodhull has also had difficulty attracting graduates of American medical schools , hospital officials say , because of bad publicity and because its residency programs have not yet been nationally approved by the American Medical Association ' s Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. // Academic affiliation with the State University of New York ' s Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn provides Woodhull with American-trained senior physicians , according to Dr. Donald E. Wilson , chairman of the Department of Medicine at Downstate . But Dr. Wilson said that all but one of Woodhull ' s 48 interns and residents are graduates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were from Burma , the Soviet Union , India , Pakistan and Jordan . One American resident said he was a graduate of St. George ' s School of Medicine in Grenada. // Though the foreign-trained residents are medically qualified , Dr. Friedman said , language and cultural differences occasionally make communication with patients and staff members difficult . The situation is expected to change . Woodhull ' s internal- medicine residency program was inspected last week , and if it is approved the hospital is expected to have no difficulty attracting American-trained residents. <> <> $22 Million Loss This Year <> <> // Finances have also required extra attention . Mr. Loran compared a public hospital like Woodhull to a bank , constantly seeking payments , settling loans , worrying about debts. // Medicaid , Medicare and other third- party insurance funds will pay about $60 million of Woodhull ' s estimated $82 million budget this fiscal year , Mr. Loran said. // The remaining $22 million is an operating loss that will be paid by the city . Next year , when all the beds are expected to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall to about $8 million. // Woodhull ' s daily Medicaid rate of $568 , which covers all hospital expenses , services and the cost of a room , is the second highest in the city , according to Health and Hospitals Corporation figures . North Central Bronx Hospital is the most expensive , with a $580 rate . <> <> Charges All-Inclusive <> <> // According to Mr. Ricke of the Health and Hospitals Corporation , $230. 10 of Woodhull ' s daily rate goes toward paying off construction and financing costs , with medical services accounting for $337. 90. // While conceding that the hospital was expensive to build and that operating costs are high , Mr. Loran , Mr. Ricke and other officials say that a hospital like Woodhull would cost even more to build today . And unlike private , voluntary hospitals such as the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan , Woodhull ' s rate is all-inclusive . If a patient needs emergency surgery , it is already paid for. // At Memorial Sloan-Kettering , which offers some of the most sophisticated medical care in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that does not include extra costs for a surgeon or anesthesiologist , according to Suzanne Rauffenbart , a spokesman for that hospital. // Mr. Loran , former acting director of Metropolitan Hospital , a municipal hospital in Manhattan , said that by the end of this summer Woodhull should be operating near capacity with a full psychiatric ward open to the public. // " To be frank , it had a reputation as a white elephant , " he said . " But the hospital is here . The community needs it . And I intend to make it work. " //
