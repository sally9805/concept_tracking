After an ingredient used in rat poison turned up in some of its pills , SmithKline Beckman last March recalled all its Contac cold-remedy capsules ( 1985 sales : $55 million ) . The episode came soon after a Peekskill , N.Y. , woman died from taking a cyanide-laced Tylenol capsule . The decision to remove Contac from the market cost SmithKline $8 million . <P> Now the company says that Contac will be back on the market this fall . The new capsules will have a transparent coat and will be sealed with red gelatin , which will make it more difficult for anyone to tamper with them . For those who are still wary , Contac will also be available for the first time in elongated tablets called caplets.
