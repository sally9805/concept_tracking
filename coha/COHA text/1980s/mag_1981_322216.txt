Each year at this time , Sir Geoffrey Gabb , George III professor of history at Cornwallis University , lectures his freshman students on a little-known but decisive episode in American history . Last week marked the 200th anniversary of that event . To commemorate the occasion TIME went to Cornwallis to record Sir Geoffrey 's idiosyncratic and provocative comments : <P> You have all heard of the battles of Hastings and Agincourt , and I doubt that there is anyone in the room who does n't know all about the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 . But I suspect that only a handful of you have even heard the name of what I believe is the most important-and glorious-victory in our nation 's history : the Battle of Yorktown in October 1781 . <P> You can learn the details of the fighting in Chapter 7 of my book The Triumph of British America : 1776-1843 , which sells for a modest 5.6 in the Coop . It is enough to say here that British forces , led by Charles Earl Cornwallis , for whom this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the French and rebellious Americans and took prisoner their commander , George Washington . If you 're interested in such peculiarities , you can see his brandy-stained teeth , which were fashioned out of hippopotamus tusk , in Prince Charles Hall , right next to Pocahontas ' feathered headdress . <P> With the capture of Washington-he was , poor chap , taken to London and hanged as a traitor-the rebellion collapsed , and no one else had the stature or the stomach to start it up again . That ancient rogue Benjamin Franklin , who had persuaded King Louis XVI to bankrupt his treasury in the rebel cause , was content to remain in Paris , for instance , chasing young ladies and flying kites in thunderstorms . Thomas Jefferson , the greatest propagandist of the age , also sought refuge in Europe , where he lived with his beautiful black mistress and continued his mischief-making for another 43 years . A fascinating , tragic figure , Jefferson became an inspiration to generations of novelists , poets and composers . Sir Walter Scott used him as the hero of Monticello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian villa , Shelley was moved to write : <P> <P> Hail to thee , blithe spirit ! Man thou never wert , That from Heaven , or near it , pourest thy full heart In profuse strains of invigorated art . <P> <P> And in my opinion the loveliest sounds in all opera occur in the final act of Verdi 's Tommaso Jefferson , when the desolate exile sings an aria to a lost ladylove in America : " O , Susannah , non piangere per me ! " ( O , Susannah , do n't you cry for me ! ) . But I am an old man and I digress . If you want to know more about these colorful characters , you can purchase my book Romantic Rebels , which is a mere 4.9 at the Coop.
