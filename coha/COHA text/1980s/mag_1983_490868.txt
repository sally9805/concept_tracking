THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment A YOUNG woman writes : The carpenter is at my house replacing the frames and glass panes of some windows . She ( it is a woman , a round , fair woman who looks more like a cook than like a carpenter , but she is a good carpenter , as I soon see ) has around her strips of wood , panes of glass , a glass cutter , a large portable electric saw , nails , hammers , and something called a caulk gun . She measures , she saws , she cuts , she sighs : it is a much more complicated job than she at first thought , the house being a very old and crooked house . The work is taking place in a bedroom , and I sit on the edge of a bed all the time , watching her . There are many things for me to do around the house ; I should also go out and run some errands . But I can not leave the carpenter 's presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ; perhaps she will say something to me . My father was a carpenter , and a cabinetmaker , too . In the world ( and it was a small world : a hundred and eight square miles , a population of sixty thousand , no deep-water harbor , so large ships had to anchor way offshore ) , my father was the second-best carpenter and cabinetmaker . The best carpenter was Mr. Walters , to whom my father had been apprenticed as a boy and for whom he had worked when he was a young man . Mr. Walters had been dead for a long time , even before I was born , but he was still the best carpenter and cabinetmaker . My father was so devoted to this man that he did everything just the way Mr. Walters would have done it . If , for instance , in 1955 you asked my father to build you a house and make you some simple chair to sit on in it , he would build you a house and make you a chair exactly like the house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My father left our house for work every weekday morning at seven o'clock , by the striking of the Anglican church hell . If it was his first day on a new job , one of his apprentices would come by a little before seven o'clock to pick up my father 's toolbox . If it was one of the older apprentices , he could walk along with my father , and they might talk . If it was one of the younger boys , he would have to walk a few steps behind . At around four o'clock in the afternoon , my father returned home . If he saw me then , he would say , " Well , we got everything in place today . " And I would say , in reply , " Oh , sir , that 's very good . " After that , he would disappear into his shop , where he made furniture . In my father 's shop , everything was some shade of brown . First , there was the color of his skin ; and he wore khaki trousers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt hat . He smoked cigarettes ( Lucky Strikes ) one after another , and he smoked so much that the thumb and the index and middle fingers of his right hand were stained brown . His hands were stained another shade of brown from handling stained wood , wood oils , and glues . Everything was brown , that is , except the red , flat carpenter 's pencil ( such an unusual , distinctive shape for a pencil , I thought , and I was sadly disappointed when I discovered that it was not a good writing pencil ) that he carried perched always behind his right ear . Sometimes when I went to watch him work , he would tell me little things about himself when he was a young man . He would talk about himself as if he were someone he used to know very well , someone he thought really an admirable person , someone he would like very much . Mostly , they were stories about himself as a cricketer . He never told me that he was good at playing cricket ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everybody said so  --  especially my mother , who would then point out that unfortunately none of this furni-ture was in our own house . I think almost every time she saw my father make something she would say to him that it would be nice to have one like that , and he would then promise to make another one , for her specially . But he never did . Finally , one day , he told her that the reason he was reluc-tant to make us up lots of furniture was that the furniture in Mrs. Wal-ters ' house ( the widow of the man to whom he had been apprenticed ) was really his : that he had made it up for himself when he was a very young man ; that he had lent it to Mrs. Wal-ters after her husband died and she had moved into a smaller house , the house she still lived in ; that he had always meant to ask for it back one day ; and that he would ask her for it soon . He never , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could bring himself to . My mother could not believe that we were never to have that beautiful Furniture ; that at Christmastime , when our friends stopped by to have a glass of rum , if too many of them came by at once some of them would always have to sit on the floor . My father would visit Mrs. Walters quite often , and every once in a while my mother would go along with him . Afterward , she would always be furious that she had had to leave what she began call-ing " my furniture " behind , and she would have a big row with herself , for my father never quarrelled with anyone  --  not even his wife . Once , my father took me with him on one of the visits . I got a good look at the furniture , and I began to understand my mother 's point of view . There was a dining table with six matching cane-bottomed chairs ( my father did all his own caning ) ; there was a little round table the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorative carvings on its sides and , above it , a mirror in a frame with decorative carvings that matched the ones on the table ; and there was a sofa , a cabinet with delicate woodworking on the glass front , and two Morris chairs . ( At the time , I did not know  --  nor , for that matter , do I think anyone else knew  --  that there was someone named Morris who had made chairs of which these two were replicas . ) We had nothing like any of this in our house . Once , my father got sick , and the doctor said that it was his heart , and gave him some medicine and told him to stay home and rest . My mother , looking up heart diseases in one of her numerous medical books , said that the sickness was from all the cigarettes he smoked . At the same time , I took sick with a case of hookworm , and my mother , looking up hookworm in one of her numerous medical books , said that it was because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was true that I did that . ( I was disappointed when it was discovered that I had hookworm , and not beriberi . I would have liked to say to my friends when they asked why I was n't in school , " Oh , I have beriberi . " ) Since my father could n't go to work and I could n't go to school , we spent all day together . In the mornings , I would go and lie with him in my parents ' bed . We would lie on our backs , our hands clasped behind our necks ( me imitating him ) , and our feet up on the windowsill in the sun . We would lie there without saying a word to each other , the only sound being pttt , pttt from my father as he forced small pieces of tobacco from his mouth . He continued to smoke , though not as much as before . At midmorning , my mother would come in to look at us . As soon as she came into the room , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we would do it right away , but as soon as she left we would put them back . When she came , she would bring with her little things to eat . Sometimes it was barley water and a special porridge , made from seaweed ; sometimes it was a beaten egg-yolks-and-milk drink , sweetened with powdered sugar ; sometimes it was a custard of some kind . Whatever it was , she would say that it would help to build us up . Before she left ; she would kiss us on our foreheads and say that we were her two invalids , the big one and the little one . In the afternoons , after our lunch , my father and I would go off to look for a wild elderberry bush and pick elderberries . He was sure that a draught prepared from the elderberries would make his heart get better faster than the medicine the doctor had prescribed . In fact , I think he took the medicine the doctor gave him only because he thought my mother might perhaps die herself if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would go and sit in the Botanical Gardens under a rubber tree . Then he would tell me stories about his own father . He had not known his father very well at all , since his father was always going off somewhere  --  usually somewhere in South America  --  to work , but he never said anything that showed he found , his father at fault . Once , he said , his father had taken a boat to Panama to build the Panama Canal . The boat got caught in a storm and sank . His father was in the sea for eleven days , just barely hanging on to a raft . He was rescued by a passing ship , which took him on to Panama , where he built the Panama Canal . For a long time , I thought that my father 's father had built the Panama Canal single-handed except perhaps with the help of one or two people , the way my father himself built things single-handed except with the help of one or two people . ? ? Closing Time WE have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the departing year but to the Teheran , a Persian-ItalianAmerican restaurant that has survived stoutly for the last thirty-odd years at 45 West Forty-fourth Street , which is an easy amble across from our office building , and an amble that has become something between habit and ritual for many of our colleagues . The Teheran has grown as familiar to many of us as our own dinner tables , JANUARY 3,1983 and the members of its staff we think of as old friends . When the first rumors of its closing seemed to be hardening into fact , we went across one lunchtime to hear at first hand about the Teheran 's rumored doom from Mr. Hank Mazzucca , who has managed the restaurant since 1951 . Hank is a gracious , soft-spoken man with a noble profile and corrugated white hair , and we watched him hovering over the lunchtime crowd , dropping a word to a waitress , shaking an occasional hand , adjusting a table , and keeping a quiet over-all eye on the buzz and clatter of lunch . Hank told us once that , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will quite often know all but four or five by sight . As the lunchers began to thin out , he came over to our table . " I first got the brutal news in the form of an official letter from my landlord , " he told us . " My lease still had time to run , and there is a clause in my contract saying that only under the condition that the building is to be demolished will I have to leave . Well , it seems that the Seymour Hotel , on Forty-fifth Street , and the New York Yacht Club , on Forty-fourth Street , have yielded up some space to a party whose name we have n't even been told yet , which plans to mount a tall building above our heads here . I imagine that the Seymour will disappear , but the Yacht Club , being a landmark building , will be spared . The entrance to the prospective building is to be from Forty-fourth Street  --  a better address , I guess  --  and that means tearing down the Teheran , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobby . Where we 're sitting now is plumb in the middle of the lobby-tobe . I brooded a bit , as you can imagine , and then I just decided to accept it , that 's all . I thought of starting again , but it would be prohibitive now in this neighborhood , and I do n't think I have the heart to do it all over again . I 'll take some time off , and then I 'll think of something . I would n't mind managing a club . The Teheran has always felt like a club , would n't you agree ? " We would indeed , considering the many times we have taken shelter , solace , and sustenance in the Teheran . It is a long and narrow two-story restaurant , with something of a Persian decor : the mirrors along the east wall have minareted tops , and on the opposite wall is a subdued mural picturing a pastoral Persia that probably never THE NEW YORKER. was . Whatever the time of day or the weather outside , the Teheran maintains inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose all track of outside time . Hank reminisced about the Teheran 's beginnings . " It actually started up in 1949 , and at the time I was offered a partnership in it , in 1951 , it served only Persian food . When I took the whole thing over  --  with my partner , Ms. Wally Colombo , who moved with me from Guidetti 's , on Forty-fifth Street , and is still with me today  --  I wanted to call it the Fifth Estate , but changing a restaurant 's name is a hazardous business , so I kept it the Teheran , although everybody referred to it as the T. I did change the menu right away , though , keeping a selection of Persian dishes but serving both Italian and American food as well , for nobody wants to eat Persian food five times a week . It was successful from the start , and I 've been very content here . It 's really people that make a restaurant  --  staff and customers  --  and I 've been lucky with both . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famously . I study my customers , and know a lot of them quite well . You remember that trouble in 1980 , the year the hostages were being held in Teheran ? Well , when President Carter began to come down on Iranian students there was some quite strong anti-Iranian feeling , and I got a hunch of threatening phone calls . Some people tried to get me to change the name of the restaurant . I got so annoyed that I put up that notice outside the entrance  --  you remember it ? I can recite it still . It said , ' We do not believe we should change our name because of a deplorable and , we hope , temporary situation . ' We weathered that one quite well , but I was just saying to Wally that what the Ayatollah could n't accomplish , the wrecker 's ball will . " It is not just the Teheran 's human customers who will lament its passing . Hamlet , the resident cat at the Algonquin , a few doors down the block , has developed a habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat . " I wish there was a way to explain things to Hamlet , " Hank said , shaking his head . " I hate to think of him turning up and finding everything gone . That 's hard on a cat . " Hank told us that when he first took the restaurant over he did a good bit of the reconstruction himself , on Sundays , when the place was closed . " My mother died a couple of weeks after I took over , " he said , " so I put some things of hers  --  a kitchen spoon , other things she used  --  into the walls I was building , for luck . I 'd rather not be around when these walls go down . " We will be left , however , to see a hole open in the block , a missing tooth , and we are hound to feel , for a month of lunchtimes , a small stumble in the rhythm of our days . Goodbye , Frances , goodbye , Margie , goodbye , Penny , goodbye , Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will recite the Teheran 's menu as a requiem . Goodbye , Wally ! Goodbye , Hank ! We keep you warm in our memory , and we wish you all well . Hoover HOOVER , an eleven-year-old harbor seal in Boston who can say " Hoover " and " Hello , there " and " Hi ! How are you ? " and " Hey , come over here " and " Get out of here , " is the only talking seal in the world  --  if you do n't count Salisbury , a younger Boston harbor seal , who can manage a " Hello ! " that sounds more like a couple of coughs , Hoover is also the first nonhuman mammal ever to have produced these particular sounds . In 1962 , Dr. John Lilly reported that a dolphin could say " Speak up ! " and " Louder ! " but that was twenty years ago . There are accounts of porpoises imitating the movements of seals , and a 1973 issue of the scholarly Dutch journal Behaviour mentions two porpoises that imitated movements of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wash the tank window , and one day a porpoise held one flipper against the window while wiping the glass with a feather and bringing up bursts of bubbles , just like the breathing of the diver . On another occasion , a second porpoise , a baby , swam past the window and saw somebody smoking a cigarette . The smoker , noticing the porpoise , blew smoke at it . The porpoise went to its mother , got a mouthful of milk , and came back and blew the milk at the smoker . In the water , the milk dispersed much as the smoke had in the air . Some remarkable activities have been reported of seals . Andre , a twenty-one-year-old harbor seal from Rockport , Maine , used to spend winters at the New England Aquarium , in Boston , and now spends winters at the Mystic Marine Life Aquarium , in Connecticut . Released into neighboring ocean waters in the spring , Andre always makes his way back to Rock port in only a few days . An old Scottish book mentions a seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pamphlet mentions a Boston seal that could turn a hurdy-gurdy . But , until Hoover , harbor seals  --  harbor seals are small seals that live mostly on or near northern ocean shores  --  had been thought not to do much vocalizing of any sort . They were known as " the silent seals . " Hoover talks in a deep , friendly , raspy bass voice that has the flattened " a " s of New England ; what he says really sounds like " Hoo-vuh , " not " Hoover , " and like " How-wah-yah " and " Come ovuh heah . " He also says , " Hello , dere , " and he has a distinct laugh ? " Heh-heh-heh-heh . " Several scientists have likened his voice to that of a wino , but when we first heard him we thought he sounded more like a cheerful retired Boston cabdriver . As it turns out , we were n't far wrong . Hoover and eleven other harbor seals live in a rhomboid-shaped concrete pool just outside the New England Aquarium , a magnificent institution that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than two thousand fish , and Lobzilla , a thirtyfive-pound lobster . The Aquarium also has a floating auditorium that five times a day presents sea-lion-anddolphin shows based entirely on animal behavior  --  no unnatural stunts  --  and it runs a notable Marine Mammal Rescue Program , which last year alone took in twenty-three stray harbor-seal JANUARY 3,1983 pups and was able to save the lives of many of them . Hoover weighs two hundred and sixty pounds . He is five feet seven inches long and eats at least fifteen pounds of herring or capelin a day . He has a sleek , well-blubbered body , a spotted gray-andkhaki-colored coat , black front and back flippers , large , lustrous , humanlike brown eyes , no ears ( harbor seals have ear slits ) , oversized pussycat whiskers , and a blunt snout , like that of a Labrador retriever . When we heard him talking , he was standing upright in the water and leaning his head back so that his eyes were under water . His mouth barely moved , but he seemed to be moving his tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest . Hoover talks only when he wants to , and he seems to want to more often in the spring ; some days he only mumbles . According to Aquarium records , which meticulously document Hoover 's behavior since he arrived there , as a four-month-old pup , in August , 1971 , Hoover first began making unexpected noises , described variously as grunts , growls , gurgles , buzzes , squawks , shrieks , and bloodcurdling screams , when he was two years old . Then there is the careful note on August 7 , 1976 , " NEVER HEARD BEFORE ! MADE SOUNDS , kS IF TALKING , " followed two years later , on November 11 , 1978 , by the definitive " SAYS ' HOOVER ' IN PLAIN ENGLISH . I HAVE WITNESSES . " Biologists and animal trainers at the Aquarium are convinced that Hoover does not know what he is saying , but they are not sure what function his talking serves , or why he says precisely what he says or seems to talk with a Boston accent . They are fascinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seal pool , and a female named Roo as well , are starting to produce unexpected noises , and they have begun a long-term investigation of the whole phenomenon of harbor-seal vocalization and mimetic behavior . Mr. George H. Swallow , of Cundys Harbor , Maine , thinks he can clear up some of the questions . Mr. Swallow and his wife , Alice , looked after Hoover for almost four months in 1971 , after her brother THE NEW YORKER found the baby seal on the beach . Hoover 's mother had been shot by a fisherman . The Swallows put the seal in their bathtub , and when he refused a bottle they mashed up mackerel in a meat grinder and force-fed him . " After a day , " says Mrs. Swallow , " he started to eat like a vacuum cleaner , so we had to name him Hoover . He ate nine mackerel in one day , and he looked like a football with a head and a tail . He was the greatest pet we 'd ever had . " George and Alice Swallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 're always babysitting some lame duck , " Mr. Swallow says . They have taken in foxes , mink , raccoons , crows , and a skunk ( briefly ) , and one winter they had a great blue heron in the house . Right now , they have a porcupine in the back yard which likes to eat apples . Mr. Swallow is sixty-eight and works as a caretaker , and he has also worked as a machinist and a florist , and he has made guitars and raced cars . He was born in a small town near Boston . Hoover outgrew the bathtub in a few days , and the Swallows placed him in a freshwater pond behind their house and put up a pup tent for him to sleep in . Hoover liked to take Mr. Swallow 's hand in his mouth , and Mr. Swallow taught Hoover to jump through a life preserver . Hoover spent a lot of time sitting in the sun , and occasionally he would come up the back steps and through the kitchen into the living room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He 'd look around , and we 'd laugh and pet him we 're a laughing family  --  and then he 'd go outside again . " Neighborhood kids liked to take Hoover for a ride in an old wheelbarrow . Mr. Swallow never tried to teach Hoover to talk ( " I would n't know anything about how to do that " ) or rewarded him with fish for any behavior he displayed , but he hollered at Hoover a lot ( " Come over here ! " " Get outa here ! " ) , and when Hoover started making gargling noises out in the pond Mr. Swallow would imitate him . " Every evening when I got home , " Mr. Swallow says , " I would get out of the car , slap my hand hard against the side , and yell ' Hey , stupid ! ' Hoover would climb out of the pond and waddle through the tall grass up toward the house , and as soon as he came into sight I 'd always say , ' Hello , there . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful lot like ' Hello , dere . ' I looked at him kind of funny and did n't think anything more about it . But a few days later some of the kids who were always hanging around the house told me my seal kept saying hello to them . That 's when I really thought he was talking . I do n't know today that I think he was talking , but I do think he was trying to he friendly . After a while , it got so I could say ' What 's your name ? ' and he 'd say ' Hoover . ' When we took him to the Aquarium  --  we felt terrible , but he was eating seventy dollars ' worth of fish a week , and it 's not right to keep a wild animal too long  --  I told a fellow there , ' I think he can talk , ' but he gave me such a look I never mentioned it again . " A year and a half ago , the Swallows visited Hoover in Boston . Mr. Swallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and took Mr. Swallow 's hand in his mouth and tried to pull him into the seal pool . There 's something else . Hoover sounds exactly like Mr. Swallow  --  except , as Mr. Swallow himself points out , when Hoover says " Hoover . " Then , Mr. Swallow says , Hoover sounds more like the daughter of a neighbor of his who used to hang around the pond and liked to tell Hoover what his name was . According to Dr. Bruce Moore , a psychologist at Dalhousie Univershy , in Halifax , Nova Scotia , who is interested in mimetic behavior , and who has an African gray parrot that can say almost two hundred words , Hoover 's behavior , although he himself has never before heard of its appearance in a seal , accords with the way mimetic birds imprint themselves on human speech : they imitate voice tones as well as words . There 's a parrot in Halifax that can say hello like the man who owns it , like his mother , and like his British uncle . For Mr. Swallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it 's that , hearing about Hoover , people may realize how much they have to learn about animals and that they might he able to learn something from animals . " I could sit and watch an animal all day , " he says . " They know a lot about the woods we do n't  --  which plants to eat , for instance . I think they can sense whether you 're looking for them or not . And they only take what they need for themselves . They believe in live and let live . They know what it 's all about .
