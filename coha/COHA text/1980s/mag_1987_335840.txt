When E.F . Hutton talks to its employees these days , they are expected not only to listen but also to take out their crayons . Last week the firm began distributing , at a cost of $50,000 , The Hutton Neighborhood Coloring Book and a box of crayons to its 18,500 workers . The purpose is to boost staff morale , which was battered by Hutton 's 1985 guilty plea to a check-overdraft scheme and further bruised by the company 's $90 million loss last year . <P> The book tells of troubles in the E.F . Hutton neighborhood : slumping lemonade sales and rough times with kids like Merrill Lynch . Presenting a " vision of what we can be , " the book urges employees to do " much more with much less . " But the attempt at spirit lifting may backfire . " Disgusting , " said an executive . " We would prefer to think that management could communicate with us in an adult fashion .
