Like more and more people in Britain these days , Lady Diana ' s parents , Earl Spencer and Frances Shand-Kydd , are divorced . And in a country where divorce and the monarchy are antithetical , by both church law and long tradition , that fact about the parents of the future queen is a startling reminder of how quickly things have changed. // " The royal family have recognized , sadly , that divorce is now a fact of life , " said a spokesman for Buckingham Palace . And so has everyone else . According to Government figures , Britain has the highest divorce rate in Western Europe , and the number of marriages dissolved last year was nearly half as large as the number of weddings. // The surge in the divorce rate , which dates from a substantial liberalization of the law 10 years ago , has touched off a national debate on the subject , with troubled Britons asking themselves what has gone wrong . <> <> Conservatives Decry ' Epidemic ' // " The future of marriage is now being questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study last spring , referring to divorce as epidemic and suggesting that the Government ought to " resume responsibility for preserving marriages. " // Within the Church of England , which still forbids the remarriage of divorced people , a meeting of the general synod next month is expected to be dominated by a contentious proposal that the ban be eased . The theological debate was heightened recently by the disclosure that an Anglican bishop in Derbyshire , a 62-year-old widower , had himself married a divorcee. // " Obviously , a good many of the old rules are changing and we in the church must adapt , " said a London clergyman , upholding the decision not to discipline the Bishop. // The British monarchy has always been particularly sensitive on the subject of divorce because the monarch , as " Defender of the Faith , " is the head of the church . It would still be unthinkable for Prince Charles to marry a divorcee , as it was for the last Prince of Wales , his great-uncle , who caused a Government crisis over the issue 45 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Love ' // Denied permission to marry Wallis Simpson , a twice-divorced American , King Edward VIII decided that he could not " discharge my duties as King as I would wish to without the help of the woman I love , " and he abdicated. // In the most traditional of Britain ' s ruling circles , there are still some people who question Charles ' s decision to marry the daughter of a divorced couple , acquiring as parents-in-law two people who until not long ago might have been barred from the Royal Enclosure at Ascot. // Because of this kind of sensitivity , the official souvenir program of the royal wedding , in a two-page article about the Spencer family , mentions Lord Spencer ' s wives but does not say that he divorced the first one before marrying the second one , and it makes no mention at all of Mrs. Shand-Kydd ' s present husband. // According to Anthony Holden , the most authoritative of Prince Charles ' s biographers , the divorce of Lady Diana ' s parents " would until recently have disqualified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the throne . This change in attitudes at Buckingham Palace is reflected most starkly within the life of a single member of the royal family - Princess Margaret . <> <> Another Dramatic Statement // In 1955 she made the painful decision not to marry Group Capt . Peter Townsend because he had been divorced . In a public explanation no less dramatic than her uncle ' s abdication statement , though with opposite effect , Princess Margaret said : // " Mindful of the church ' s teaching that Christian marriage is indissoluble , and conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth , I have decided to put these considerations before any others. " // And yet 23 years later she was herself divorced , from Lord Snowdon , who promptly remarried and now lives with his wife and a new baby a few blocks from the Princess in South Kensington. // The dissolution of Princess Margaret ' s marriage , which brought divorce closer to the throne than it had been since the days of Henry VIII , was accomplished under a 1971 law that permits divorce after two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <> <> Proof of Adultery Was Required // Before that , divorce was very difficult to obtain in Britain , often requiring proof of adultery . That helped to make sensational newspaper copy out of the divorces of the well-born , including Lady Diana ' s parents , who were married in Westminster Abbey in 1954 before a congregation of 1 , 500 that included Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip. // They were divorced in 1969 in a bitter and well-publicized case in which Lady Diana ' s mother was established as the so-called guilty party , and custody of their four children was awarded to Lord Spencer . Lady Diana , who was 7 years old at the time , has told friends that the traumatic divorce was the major event of her childhood. // That year , there were 50 , 000 divorces in Britain ; last year there were more than 150 , 000 . And although the rate of divorce here is still considerably below that of the United States , the obvious conclusion is that making divorce easier in Britain has damaged the institution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagrees. // " Easier divorce without recrimination does not weaken the institution of marriage ; it strengthens it , " he said . " Those who want to stay married will do so , and those who want divorce will no longer remain artificially and perhaps hypocritically married because of legal technicalities . " <> <> No Longer a Lifetime Union // On the other hand , the Law Commission , in a study last fall , found a growing body of opinion " that marriage can no longer be regarded as a life-time union , " and the recent Conservative lawyers ' report warned : // " In the space of a decade , the law and the church - the two pillars which supported marriage - have both collapsed . Divorce is now a matter of personal choice. " // Into this rapidly changing situation come Charles and Diana , representing , as the monarchy often does here , stability and the reaffirmation of old values . A few years ago , Prince Charles told an interviewer that when he finally got married he expected to be " forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because I ' ve been brought up in a close-knit , happy family. " // His ability to represent happy family life to a nation in which it seems more and more threatened is one reason that the royal wedding , despite large doses of commercialism and trivia , is important to Britain . The Most Rev. Stuart Blanch , the Archbishop of York , put it this way : // " While the royal wedding will be a personal act of commitment similar to any other wedding between any couple in any parish church , it will also be a recognition of the interdependence of spiritual and political authority in the life of the nation , which we must surely continue to value.
