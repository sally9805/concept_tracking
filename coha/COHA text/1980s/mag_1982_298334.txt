Palace intruder is innocent <P> Asked why he had committed the alleged burglary and drunk wine belonging to the son of the owner of the premises , the defendant replied that he was " obeying a little voice in my head . Security was so bad I wanted to show as an example that I could get in . " As for the alleged theft , he said , " I was thirsty and could not find a tap . The wine was in a cupboard . I was just waiting to be captured . " As courtroom explanations go , they were certainly imaginative . But they were enough to convince a jury at London 's Old Bailey that Michael Fagan , 34 , had not acted criminally . After deliberating for only 14 minutes , the jury found the unemployed laborer not guilty of burglarizing Buckingham Palace last June 7 , when he drank half of a $5.40 bottle of Riesling belonging to Prince Charles . <P> Fagan was arrested not during that visit but on a more famous one a month later . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palace . After wandering the corridors , he entered Queen Elizabeth 's bedroom and woke the sleeping monarch . Police did not charge Fagan with a crime for that intrusion , since he had not threatened any harm to the Queen or stolen any possessions . Under British law , trespass without causing actual damage or harming anyone is a civil matter and does not carry the risk of a jail sentence . Fagan was on trial for a burglary only in connection with his earlier , undetected breakin , which he confessed to police after his arrest . Yet to make the Burglary charge stick , the prosecution had to prove that Fagan had entered the palace with the intention of stealing something , a notion the jury rejected . <P> However correct in law , Fagan 's acquittal prompted public expressions of outrage and raised the possibility of legal reform . Home Secretary William Whitelaw said a change in the law of trespass may be considered to make it possible to charge trespassers with criminal penalties . Said the tabloid Sun : " Next time you are walking along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buckingham palace for a glass or two ? "
