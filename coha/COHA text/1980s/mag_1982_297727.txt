A special prosecutor is named <P> " It is a serious investigation , a matter that requires diligence and attention to detail . " So said New York Attorney Leon Silverman last week after his appointment by a panel of federal judges as a special prosecutor to investigate the scandals swirling around Secretary of Labor Raymond Donovan . <P> Silverman , 60 , who describes himself as a political " independent , " is a senior partner with the corporate law firm of Fried , Frank , Harris , Shriver and Jacobson .

The judges , however , empowered Silverman to investigate " any other allegation or evidence of violation of any federal criminal law by Secretary Donovan . " Unlike the Justice Department in its inquiry , Silverman will have authority to grant legal immunity to any key prosecution witnesses . Should the inquiry find supportive evidence , Silverman can impanel a grand jury to seek criminal charges . <P> Interviewed by TIME , Silverman said that if they seemed relevant to his investigation , he would seek access to court-sealed FBI tapes of conversations by a Schiavone subcontractor , William Masselli , a convicted hijacker and alleged Mafioso . TIME has learned that federal court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a close relationship between Masselli and Louis Sanzo , the union boss who allegedly pocketed $2,000 in Schiavone funds at a restaurant in New York while Donovan looked on . Until now the Justice Department has maintained that no evidence links Sanzo with Masselli . But Masselli has appeared in court as a defense witness for Sanzo , and in a 1978 taped conversation with an undercover agent , Sanzo clearly describes Masselli as a " very dear friend of mine . . . he 's great .
