txt Up to the moment they boarded a Mobil Corp . chartered jet last Monday , Cecil Kersting and his wife were unhappy about President Reagan 's request that they come home . Mr. Kersting , a 52-year-old geologist , spent 10 years working here for Mobil . On weekends , he liked to ramble in the Libyan Desert pursuing his hobbies of archaeology and bird watching . During all that time , the only run-in he remembers having with the Libyan authorities was when he went bird watching along the coast with a pair of binoculars . " I 've never felt endangered or Jeopardized here , " Mr. Kersting said before leaving . He echoed the sentiments of nearly all the 68 Mobil employes and dependents who left Monday . The Americans leaving Libya are refugees who do n't want to be evacuated . Most of them are surprisingly enthusiastic about life in Libya . They angrily  --  and sometimes tearfully ? reject the Reagan administration 's request last Thursday that they leave the country because they are in " danger " from the regime of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its request for the evacuation was made to protect American lives and to avoid a possible hostage situation . However , since the move will deny Libya the skills of American technicians , there are those who see it as a retaliation against what U.S. officials charge is a Libyan plot to assassinate President Reagan and other top U.S. leaders . Libya has denied the plot allegation . The effect of the U.S. move on Libya will probably be limited , according to diplomats , Libyan officials and oil-company analysts here . They say that as long as the U.S. companies that work in partnership with the Libyan government are allowed to maintain a corporate presence here , they can probably replace U.S. technicians with non-U.S . employes  --  and keep the oil and Libyan profits flowing . " There might be a bit of a dip in operations , but I think Mobil can get by here without American technicians , " said Ed Gaughan , a 54-year-old Mobil geophysicist , before he left Monday . The Americans who are reluctantly leaving here are a tough breed . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots where oil is produced . They have long ago become accustomed to environments that most Americans would find intolerable . Moving Around The Kerstings , for example , have lived in the heat of Venezuela , in Turkey during a coup , in Libya under the regime of King Idris , in chaotic Indonesia and in the Libya of Col. Qadhafi . After a Christmas holiday in Michigan , Mr. Kersting hopes to return overseas , perhaps to Cameroon . " I 've been at it so long , it 's a way of life . " he said of foreign assignments . Mr. Gaughan , a lanky West Virginian , was in Libya for most of the last 16 years . Before that he was in Saudi Arabia for four years and in what is now Bangladesh for three years . " I do n't like to leave , " he said glumly . He hopes Mobil will send him next to Egypt or Nigeria . Here in Libya , the American oil technicians have lived with angry anti-American rhetoric so long that they hardly bat an eye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country is a nice place to live . The anger at being asked to leave ? for what many of the Americans here believe are political reasons  --  is pervasive even among the young Americans who are enrolled at the Oilfield Companies School here . Youthful Exuberance Christine Hagar , an 11-year-old student at the school , summed up the American community 's sentiments with yOuthful exuberance in a protest letter this week to President Reagan : " I really would like to tell you what I think of your ordering Americans back to America , " she wrote . " If that 's your idea of freedom , you belong in a funny farm .... " I know right now you 're probably saying , ' What 's a girl of 11 years telling me what she thinks of my idea ? ' But being American and being in Libya , I have everything to do with this . You say there is danger in Libya . Ha - Ha . The people here are very nice and would n't harm Americans for a million years . " The school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , symbolizes the effort of the American expatriates to make the best of their time In Libya . Besides high educational standards , It boasts such amenities as a baseball diamond and tennis courts . But as the American community has slowly dwindled here in recent years because of U.S.-Libyan tensions , the number of American students has declined to about 100 out of a total enrollment of 750 . Nearly all the teachers are still Americans . however , and it looks as though they will have to leave soon  --  to the regret of many . " I feel much safer living here than in Philadelphia , " says Gloria Weber . a sixthgrade teacher . " This is my home . " She adds that she remembers how Libyans protected her and provided her with food during the 1969 revolution that brought Col. Qadhafi to power . Ruth Monson , an administrator at the school and the wife of its principal , gets so upset in discussing the departure of Americans here that she bursts into tears . With the American teachers leaving soon , she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be forced to close its doors ? and its students will be scattered around the world . " We are n't afraid of this end , " Mrs. Monson says of the Libyan government . " We 're afraid of the other end " ? meaning the Reagan administration . What frightened her most of all , she says , was last Friday 's announcement that the U.S. Sixth Fleet was standing off the Libyan coast , ready to " rescue " Americans . The major U.S. oil companies here are Mobil , Occidental Petroleum Corp .. Amerada Hess Corp .. Marathon Oil Co. and Du Pont Co. ' s Conoco Inc. unit . ( Exxon Corp . ' s Libyan unit has already announced that it plans to leave Libya entirely . ) The departure of the oil-company employes comes Just at the time when Libyan authorities are trying to make oil production here more profitable for the U.S. concerns . The official Libyan selling price now is $37.50 a barrel ? down substantially from $41 before this year 's oil glut . And changes in tax and royalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts have helped Libya increase its output this month to an estimated one million to 1.3 million barrels a day . That is up sharply from the 600.000 to 700,000 barrels a day that Libya produced during the height of the oil glut last summer and this fall , but still below last year 's average 1.6 million barrels a day . For the oil companies here , the departure of American employes will mean a complicated juggling of people . To accomplish that and to negotiate new contracts with the Libyan government , the companies are hoping that top U.S. managers can stay here a few more weeks or months . Meanwhile , the U.S. companies have been requested by the State Department to provide what a cable terms " daily , repeat daily " reports to Washington about how many Americans have left the country . For the oilmen , the body count is regarded as an added nuisance . As far as their staffing problems are concerned . " The companies can find a solution . I guess , " says a Libyan manager with Conoco here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the oil business , " he says , " you trade people back and forth from one country to another anyway . "
