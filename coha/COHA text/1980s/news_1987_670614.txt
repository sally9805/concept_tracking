This observation comes after my first two experiences shooting a slide-action repeating shotgun. // The gun - it ' s brand-new - is built to handle the nontoxic steel shot that is already required for waterfowling in many states or in portions of them . The steel shot will be mandatory throughout the nation in 1991 , in shells and in loose form for muzzle-loading weapons. // One of the disadvantages of such pellets is that , being much harder than lead , they can damage the barrels of older shotguns , particularly fine vintage doubles , whether side by side or over and under . Bite the pellet , I have advised those who own such waterfowling pieces . Hang them on the wall and purchase a new gun that can take the pounding dished out by the steel loads. // The over-and-under gun that I have been using to hunt ducks and geese in the past decade is middle-aged rather than venerable , but I didn ' t want to take the chance of harming it , so early this year , I set about finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double gun , but that would have set me back more than $1 , 000 , and my New England frugality would not allow such profligacy . That limited my choices to the less-expensive pump guns ( repeaters ) or semi-automatics. // The latter , I knew , would probably be easier for me to deal with , because all one has to do for the next shot is pull the trigger . I was fearful that , never having used a repeating shotgun in my life , I wouldn ' t remember to pump a new shell into the chamber after a first shell had been fired . In spite of this , I settled on a repeater . It is cheaper than an automatic , and several longtime duck-hunting friends told me that it is less likely to malfunction , particularly when hunting in coastal areas where wind-driven sand can work its way into a gun ' s innards . All but one of those friends said that the Remington Model 870 pump was the gun to get because it would go on forever . Expecting to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as yet unfired 870 and a box of steel-loaded shells , I joined my oldest son , Steve , for a few hours of duck hunting a short while ago. // It was a poor day for waterfowling , mild and still , conditions under which the birds tend to bask in the sunlight on the water rather than seeking shoreline shelter . But it was the only day in the week on which we both felt comfortable getting to work at 9 A.M. rather than 7 : 30 or 8 . We rose at 4 : 30 and had a few dozen decoys , mostly bluebills , on the water in front of our blind before sunup. // To the south of us , about half a mile away , a large flock of bluebills had congregated against the barrier beach , diving for food and frolicking on the smooth water . When the sun rose over the ocean , they couldn ' t be seen in the blaze of shimmering light . It was obvious that they were not going to come our way , but out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and forth . These hardy , vivacious , fast-flying little ducks , frequently called butterballs , are not prime quarry for the waterfowler . They eat large amounts of crustaceans , and many hunters find their flesh unpalatable because of this. // Both Steve and I enjoy dining on buffleheads , so when three of them came to our decoys , Steve shot two and I dropped the third . We used only three shells to accomplish this , so I had no opportunity to see if I could work the action of the gun rapidly enough for a second shot . I did , however , note that I didn ' t remember to jack in a new shell until after the birds hit the water . A few minutes later , we bagged two more with one shot each , and again I was slow in getting a fresh shell into the chamber. // A lone mallard drake flew past well out of range , then wheeled and landed 150 yards away against the shore . Steve gabbled at him , and he began to paddle toward us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleaming in the brilliant sunlight . Always a gentleman , Steve insisted that I take him . I stood , the bird burst from the water and I fired and missed. // It was an easy shot that I sometimes muff , forgetting to " cover " the rising duck with the gun ' s muzzle at the instant the trigger is pulled . I was not too concerned , however , for the mallard was still less than 45 yards away . I pulled the trigger for the second shot and nothing happened ; perhaps two seconds later , I realized that I had forgotten to work the gun ' s action. // We filled our limit of four buffleheads each in the next half-hour . Again I was able to fire only one shot at each of the bunches of birds that came in , and it was clear that unless I could mend my ways , my new pump gun was , for practical purposes , nothing more than a single-shot weapon with a convenient receptacle for storing two extra shells. // I brooded on this occasionally in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Late on a dark afternoon , I went to a pothole , put out one oversized decoy - I was after black ducks or mallards - and huddled in the bushes as a half-gale from the northwest churned up sizable waves on the main part of the salt pond , bending and tossing the marsh grass and the tall , tousled-headed phragmites before me . Two mergansers flew past far out on the pond . The setting sun slipped through the clouds for an instant , bathing the marsh , the meadow , the pond , the barrier beach and the unrolling scrolls of surf in a holy light . Less than three minutes from sundown - at which , waterfowling must legally stop - five mallards came in low over the meadow and headed for my lone decoy . I shot the lead bird and , after a short hesitation , pumped in a fresh round and shot the last one as it appeared for an instant through an opening in the phragmites. // I was content . I hadn ' t mastered the new gun , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 20 minutes at 450 degrees - are excellent fare , particularly if one serves them with wild rice and a thin , tart sauce of beach plum or currant jelly , orange marmalade , mustard and grated lemon rind. //
