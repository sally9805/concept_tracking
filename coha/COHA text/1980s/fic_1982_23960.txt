THE BRAHMS LULLABY A Story by Nicholas von Hoffman I N FOR a penny , in for a pound . Ellen had decided to make caponata , the delicious but complicated eggplant hors d'oeuvre . It was her domestic year , her year away from the law office , her year to be a mother , and in the course of it she had found herself assaulting the distaff arts . Her projects had not always worked out well , and seldom on schedule , so she was up later than usual finishing the caponata and putting it in Mason jars . While the jars sealed themselves in their bubbling water bath , Ellen turned on the TV and learned about the crisis from Ted Koppel on ABC News ' " Nightline . " His eyes were too close together , an unattractive feature , but his baritone voice was authoritative . The square way he faced into the camera indicated he was a person you could depend on , and he said it was a crisis , a true crisis , and that the world was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility of atomic war . " which disturbed Ellen . She was of the opinion that if you do n't want something to happen , it is best not to talk about it . Superstition , but if you 're living in a half-timbered Tudor cottage in the sylvan outskirts of an exurban village called Groton-on-Hudson , the rubbing of amulets. the knocking on wood , and the performance of certain other private , secret . and personal rituals is your only hope of influencing world affairs . Ergo , Ted Koppel had erred , seriously erred by mentioning the unmentionable . It was bad enough to think the unthinkable , but you ca n't help doing that from time to time , no matter how often you say to yourself , " What 's the use of thinking about it ? There 's nothing anybody can do . " After tucking her jars and Ted Koppel away . Ellen tiptoed into Bruce Jr . ' s bedroom to check on him and then slipped into Bruce Sr. 's bed . Nicholas von Hoffman Husband and father was so deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifted off to dream of Armageddon . The clock on the cover of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists was whirring and the minute hand was trembling , about to tick over to midnight . As the first bell of infinity tolled , Ellen burst into the locker room of the New York Rangers hockey team , somewhere in Madison Square Garden , and shouted at the boys , " It is fifty-eight seconds before nowhere . Your last chance . " Whereupon she stripped and dropped onto the floor slippery with soap and athlete's-foot remedies while the men lined up , much the way they did when they skated into the arena , dropped their pants , and had her , one by one . In her dream , she and Western Civ perished in the smell of liniment and arnica , orgasms exploding in her , the bomb exploding over the Empire State Building . " Not with a whimper but a bang , " Ellen said , waking up holding a bouquet of emotions , fear , lust , guilt , and apprehension for her loved ones . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her subconscious , that it would stoop to a pun about the end of the world . She rolled over , intent on attacking Bruce , but instead of his sparse muscles , there was pillow and cold sheet . Six twenty-five already . He would be well into the final phases of his daily five-mile jog . Not a sound from the baby . How could two such intense parents have such a laid-back baby ? Soft eyes and gentle , curved cheeks , Bruce Jr . got in his eleven hours of zees and woke up wet but chuckling . There was time to ponder the dream . It was the bad girl in her , Ellen thought . the bad girl she 'd never been able to expunge or emancipate , but Ellen had resolved her difficulties by marrying a good boy . She could hear her good boy in the kitchen . He was making Tiger 's Milk . Why do n't those health people call it lion 's milk ? And Bruce would clean up after himself . He was so good . so considerate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she heard him go into the bathroom and turn on the shower , an activity that drew her out of bed and into the bathroom , where she took off her nightgown , reached through the curtain , and goosed him . " Ellen ! " he shouted . She was in on him , touching him , pressing up against him . " Lordy , you do have the cutest little buns . It 's the jogging . Promise me you 'll never stop jogging . I could n't stand it if you were to develop derriere spread . Do you want to hear my dream last night ? It was in color . I screwed the New York Rangers , all of ' em . " " Ellen ! " Bruce yowled . " You never get the important parts clean , Bruce , " she said , going after him with the soap as he squirmed away . " It 's one of those new gels . You 'll love it . Sensual but not threatening . " " I 'm going to miss my train , Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a beautiful body if you do n't use it ? I did all those horrible exercises to keep my breasts tight after the baby and do you know how long it 's been since we 've made love ? " " You do n't want to make love . You want to screw and I 'll miss my train and Judge Magruder  --  do you remember Punctuality Magruder ? ? will throw me out of the courtroom . We can make love this evening . " " What if the world ends this afternoon ? What if they drop the bomb ? " Ellen asked , but he was already in the bedroom . " You 'll be sorry , " she said softly in the shower and noticed she was crying . She stopped that and wondered if her period was due . to the doctor 's and been told she only had a year left of life . Now the year was up and she could look back on it and tell herself that it had been a year of extreme joy in the small joys , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current events , knitting uneven rows , discovering you can make catsup out of plums and get lost taking care of a baby . In the middle of an afternoon consecrated to canning the rest of the caponata , " General Hospital " went off the air in mid-sentence . ( Bruce Jr . had been solemnly threatened not to tell anyone that Ellen had started watching soaps . ) The picture faded into squiggly lines , and a voice said , " For the next sixty seconds this station will conduct a test of the Emergency Broadcast System . " There was a whistling sound for a minute and then , " This has been a test of the Emergency Broadcast System . The test is not over . The test is not over . Please turn your dial indicator to Channel 5 . " The other channels on the rotary were also squiggly lines and snowy dots . Channel 5 had a face . It was Diane Sawyer 's , the CBS News blonde with the contralto voice . Ellen , without thinking or knowing why , picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with grave and delicate diction , " To repeat . . . the red alert has been extended from the armed services to include the seacoast states . The concern , the Pentagon has announced , has to do with the possibility of certain persons entering the United States via a seaport . If you are not a resident of a seacoast state , your area is not under an alert . If you are in a seacoast state , you are asked to turn to this channel every hour or so for a status update . Regular programming is resuming on all other chan-nels . " Ellen put Bruce Jr . back in his high chair and switched to " General Hospital . " The program had lost its zest . She dialed Bruce Sr. in the city but a recorded message told her the circuits were busy , so she put the baby in the car and drove twenty miles to an organic health-food store that charged 25 percent more than the other stores and loaded up on what Ellen called Bruce 's beta blockers . Of late Bruce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least , called beta blockers . They were supposed to prevent heart attacks , although Ellen was convinced men like Bruce with cute little fannies were immune to cardiovascular disease . She would prepare a beta-blocker feast for him when he came home . She would stuff him with every life-giving substance . Block his betas and his alphas and his gammas if he had any of them . On Channel 5 , Diane Sawyer was gone , replaced by Edwin Newman , whose tones were fatherly . He had a reassuring manner , although he did put Ohio on red alert . Not good . She turned the box off , bounced the baby , changed his diapers , and put a John Lennon record on the stereo . On went the TV . It was the late-afternoon period of interlocutors sitting about on U-shaped couches with movie stars with new movies and authors with new books . Black noise . Back to Channel 5. where Edwin Newman had been relieved by John Hart , who was saying that the inclusion of Ohio on the red-alert list was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also Hawaii . His voice was all empathy and care . God ! They 're putting all the lovable ones on so as not to scare us . CA N'T handle this , " Ellen began to announce to herself , and then changed her mind . " I can too . I am a tigress . I mean I am a tiger . No , damn it , I 'm a lioness . Man cats are no good for nothing and I am a mean cat , a female feline defending my young and there is my young . A boy , would n't you know ? I 'm a tigress , I 'm a tiger . Hell , I 'm a wifey . It 's time to pick up Bruce at the station . Well , I said I wanted a year of exactly this . " The amiable baby turned cranky when his father slipped into sight . " I 'll drive , " Bruce said . " No , you hold Junior , " Ellen replied in her testiest tone . " I 've asked you not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whenever Ellen was in a no  --  mood-to  --  you fill in the blanks  --  she called the baby " Junior " and it unfailingly got a rise out of Bruce . " It was tacky to name him Junior , " she replied . " It 's the most natural thing in the world for a man to want his son to carry on his name . " " You are the most natural fool in the world , Bruce , " she told her husband as he surrendered , got in on the passenger side . and picked up the cranking baby . When they got home she popped the baby in his high chair and began heating the little bottles of baby food in a saucepan of water . Bruce vanished , to reappear in his jogging suit . " You did that already today . How about feeding the carrier of your name his supper while I go jogging . I have been trapped in this house with the baby and the news reports all day and I 'm getting near not being able to handle it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm all suited up . " But Ellen was back in control . She could get him to do what she wanted if she played her biochemistry right . " Bruce , I 'm feeling very anxious . 1 think my endorphin levels are much too low . I really need this jog . " Bruce had been reading about endorphins , a substance in the blood that was created , he said , by exercise and that gave you " a natural high . " As Ellen would readily admit , she did n't know the difference between an endorphin and a beta blocker and she wondered if Bruce did , but when you put something to him that way , in his own healthful language , he immediately gave in . He was a good boy . Ellen ran , thinking about . Edwin Newman and John Hart and Diane Sawyer , attending physicians at the death of the world . A good bedside manner , cool but friendly , competent but relaxed . Global Hospital . Ellen ran some more until her injured spirit subsided and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a tree , bend over , her hands on her knees , and rest , gather herself up , and run some more . The pain of body , being more acute , masked the pain of the soul , and when she reappeared at the back A door . Bruce had put Bruce Jr . to bed and was doing sit-ups in the bedroom . " I love you , " Ellen said , to which dear Bruce grumphed an affectionate reciprocation . After showering , she said she had to lie down before fixing dinner , but when Ellen awoke it was after 11 . Getting up from the living-room couch , she went into the bedroom . where Bruce snoozed in the dark . " I had a beta-blocker feast for you and you went to bed without anything , I 'll bet . " With which 52 the cat scraped fur against her leg and Ellen , picking up the small house tiger , stroked its head and asked , " Smedley , did he feed you supper ? " Ellen had determined that Ted Koppel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her mental health . She would not watch the pinch-eyed , beak-nosed baritone speaker , but Ellen did . She heard him say that it had been determined , it had been ascertained . that it was necessary to make the other side believe we were n't kidding , that if they pushed us , we would push back . To make our determination " credible " it had been decided that certain selected urban areas , to be announced tomorrow , would be evacuated . Ellen noticed she had a fist in her mouth and was making a sound that , when she stood back and listened to it , was identical to a squeak . She was squeaking . The Koppel voice continued to amplify and explain . Ellen got up and walked a lopsided figure eight . Leaders had been summoned . Ellen was fumbling with something on the dining-room table . Bipartisan unity . Ellen was opening kitchen cupboards . Congressional leaders agreed to expedite . Ellen was looking for a bottle of endorphins . The Joint Chiefs of Staff arrived also . Oh , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bottles , but they ought to have it in capsule form in case of late-night anxieties . The National Security Council summoned . At a quarter of twelve one ca n't go jogging to pump up the endorphin supply . Ellen switched to Channel 5 . It was John Hart saying the president would talk tomorrow . Ellen decided her legs hurt too much to make endorphins by running . There must be something in a bottle in the medicine cabinet , to which she went and swallowed some pills that she thought were for sleeping but might have been stale penicillin . They could make you small , she thought , and went to sleep saying , " I want to be small . " Bad Girl Ellen took her spirit down the Hudson and into the Rangers ' locker room , only tonight she got there after they had fin-. ished the game . The team was sitting on two benches opposite each other , fully clad , even their helmets on , their sticks between their legs , their gaze on the slimy floor . Ellen walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair but prevented by their armor from doing so . She struck her sexiest pose . They did n't look up . " Gang-bang an upper-middle-class , college-educated , professional woman . Socioeconomic abasement . Gang-bang a lawyer , you 'll never be able to fuck the bar again .. Gang-bang , bang , bang . " bedroom the amiable but now sopping baby made a polite whimper . Ellen got Bruce Jr . up and fed him . She tried to call her mother , but the long-distance lines were still clogged , so she called the woman who was supposed to come in and take care of the baby that afternoon . Ellen wanted to know if she might be able to come over earlier . Ellen was strangling , marooned in the house , but the woman said her family was driving to Beloit . Wisconsin , that morning , " and you 'd best get out of here , too . " ? A LL THE channels on the dial displayed the president 's face . He seemed self-possessed and said he was " the first president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Appalachia . " The male gender is hypnotized by the recording of firsts , Ellen decided , and then she said to herself , " I hate the man . " The man then said there was no cause for alarm . " The best way to avoid an atomic war , " he continued , " is to show the other side we 're not afraid to fight one , so I am ordering certain steps to be taken to make our determination credible to the Soviet Union . " He then discussed freedom in terms that made Ellen think that , like oil , its price had zoomed . Next the president said he knew he could count on Ellen and her fellow countrymen and women . He specifically said " countrymen and women . " so that Ellen exhaled air , looked at the gurgling baby , and said . " So now we get equal billing . " She leaned over and wiped a small blob of Gerber 's pudding off Bruce Jr . ' s face , looked at her son , and in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of this child ? " 54 The baby looked startled and , as the notes of Ellen 's imprecation died in mother 's and child 's head , the even timbre of presidential speech reasserted itself in the room . The chief executive was repeating the need to be calm and to follow the instructions of " the wardens , marshals , and other national-emergency officials in your community . " Ellen took the stubby spoon away from the infant , who was ? but occasionally able to transfer some pudding from his dish to his mouth . She cleaned up his face and made as if to go about the business of feeding him with the dispatch of one stoking the coal box of a furnace . The baby , however , commenced a happy , distracted chirping as he looked down over the rim of the high chair at Smedley , the cat , who sat on his haunches , front legs stiff and together , staring back into Bruce Jr . ' s eyes , opening and closing his mouth so that a small , rough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taking in the vignette between child and cat , Ellen put down the spoon , jumped up from her chair , stood still , then walked over to the wall and rested her forehead against it . When old people , when sick people , suffer a long dying , the world has quit them before they quit the world . Shut in , closed down , sight and taste and sound traded in for helpless pain , ? they leave what they ca n't enjoy . Ellen had lived through the bad deaths of close ones , but not dying when you can still jog , when you have the last droplets of milk in your breasts . She opened her blouse and , picking up the child , gave him her nipple , but the baby was already weaned , so that he played with the rosy object rather than sucked it . Yet Ellen , holding his head against her breast , looking down at him once more in that familiar position , Ellen , the mother , tasted the remembrance of giving her child milk and life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce Jr . into his playpen , Ellen sat down to watch " General Hospital . " She knew in a formless way she should n't . She ought to be making plans , preparing , at least dialing Bruce in the city . She did , but received only a medley of beeps , cheeps , and echoing boings . She hung up with force and turned back to the soap opera in time to read an announcement on the screen requesting her to turn to Channel 5 , the Emergency Broadcast System . A voice from the loudspeaker pro- , nounced the same words she was reading . She did what she was told . There Ellen beheld the archetypal television anchor desk , convex toward the viewers . Affixed to the front of the desk were plaques with the seals of the various branches of the armed forces , and behind it to one side was an American flag . Dominating the center was the Great Seal of the Republic , in front of which was Walter Cronkite . On one side of him sat Eric Sevareid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , white-haired with wisdom and experience , the familiar guides through the catastrophes of the twentieth century , reassured Ellen . It would be all right . II " I need a mood elevator . How about a drink ? " Ellen heard herself say as she found her way to a beer and sat down in front of the tube , absentmindedly giving Bruce Jr . a rubber elephant and picking up a recalcitrant Smedley to stroke . Walter Cronkite was explaining how it would be carried out . As much as possible , the Emergency Broadcast System , your show of shows , would be structured to repeat previous viewing experience . It would be handled like an election , with the white-haired electronic Nestors doing the big picture , younger persons at the regional " desks , " and the overseas studio operating somewhere in Europe near NATO headquarters . The camera cut to John Chancellor , who occupied an intermediate position in the room , not old enough to be a big-picture person but too distinguished for the youthful regionals that were being held down by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad for Koppel 's being there . John Chancellor explained that although this " news-a-than , if I may be permitted a jocular note in a very grave situation , is naturally unsponsored , we are going to cut away from time to time for commercials . The feeling here is that we in the studio are used to commercials and we think you out there are also . We are a society of eight-minute bites separated by commercials . " The commercials , he went on to say , would be either of the public-service kind or old ones advertising merchandise no longer offered for sale . " We might , " he said with a deprecatory chuckle , " show an old Edsel commercial . " " I ca n't deal with this , " Ellen said and dropped the cat . Cut back to Walter Cronkite , who began speaking as they do when they say , " We have the first few scattered returns coming in , " but instead he said in tones Ellen could not remember not hearing , " Scattered fighting between Warsaw Pact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing more is known . Also , a commercial jetliner arriving from Chicago has crashed at New York City 's John F. Kennedy Airport . The event is not war-related except that the communications snafus we 're experiencing may have had something to do with it . " Where are the Carpathian Mountains ? They sounded sinister to Ellen . Fighting in the Carpathian Mountains and no " General Hospital " in Groton-on-Hudson . Why did n't Bruce call ? What was he thinking of , going to work today ? Walter Cronkite was explaining that the evacuation order of the nation 's twenty-five largest cities should not be taken to imply that our government expected them to be bombed . Emptying them was merely a signal that the Russians could not hold them captive to the threat of bombing them . The word " credibility " was being used over and over on the television . When it 's war , it 's credibility , when it 's human relations , it 's sincerity , and when it 's religion , it 's faith , Ellen thought , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they were bobbing into a dark slick . Was she being punished , she asked , for being a bad girl ? Her dreams , her urges . The New York Rangers , three men , not counting that peculiar night with George . " We emphasize , " Walter Cronkite was saying in a voice both warm and matter-of-fact , " that the evacuation of New York , Los Angeles , and Chicago , the very biggest cities , is partial ... limited to lower-income sections where people do not have their own transportation . Others naturally are free to make their own arrangements and go . Our regional desks will list the various towns and rural areas that have been designated host communities for the evacuees . But first I want to ask Eric Sevareid to give us his unique perspective on these events . Eric ... " A S. THE sage of the airwaves began to talk about Dolly Madison and the evacuation of Washington during the War of 1812 , Ellen fled to the telephone . No dial tone now , but then it clicked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , the phone made all the wrong noises , so Ellen dialed the operator to plead and complain that she had been trying for hours to call her husband . " We 're sorry , the circuits are overloaded . Please place your call later , " the operator said . It was a man 's voice , causing Ellen to be pleased , as she always was when she got a male operator , that old distinctions were breaking down . " Like everything else , " a voice in her head added . In the village , people were parking illegally , zigzagging and jay-walking in the erratic fashion of machines with damaged gyroscopes . Strangers were talking to each other and friends were scarcely recognizing friends . A general psychic disorder was apparent to Ellen as she got out of the car and put the baby in what Bruce Sr. called her kangaroo pouch , a canvas sling for transporting infants . Sal , the manager of the village 's up-market grocery store , stood by the establishment 's glass door , to which a crayoned sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was turning away , her mind fixed on where she might go , when Sal beckoned to her . " Oh , thanks . Sal . I only need a few things . " " Only regular customers today an ' you better hoard all you can . I do n't know when we 'll get another delivery . Have you heard ? " " Heard ? " Ellen asked . She 'd heard everything and nothing the last forty-eight hours . " The government 's busin ' in every nigger in New York . We 're a host area for the South Bronx , can ya believe it ? " " I can believe it , Sal . " " If your husband does n't have no gun , ya better get one before they begin shippin ' in the animals , " Sal instructed Ellen , locking the door and shaking off a would-be customerthrough the window . " Nuthin ' fancy . Just get one that makes a big hole ... we 're gain ' to war to protect the right to rape . " Ellen had her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short-sleeved blue shirt , neat with tie and tie tack . Pushing the cart toward the canned goods  --  they did n't have to be refrigerated  --  Ellen thought about the several times when she 'd called people on such words . Not today . Around her she noticed women , Vogue women turned out in Adolfo suits , sweeping goods off the shelves into carts . Several of them had brought their black maids . It reminded Ellen of Hattie McDaniel in Gone With the Wind , and she found herself pushing whatever was left into her cart . A woman rushed by her so fast and carelessly she knocked Ellen back against the shelves and bruised the baby , who began to cry . " God ! Watch where you 're going ! " " What 's wrong with you  --  bringing a baby into a place like this , " the woman , a silver-haired dowager of grandmotherly mien , snapped . " Why did you bring him here ? " Misunderstanding her , Ellen shouted back , " Because I did n't believe in abortion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her mania so she could focus on Ellen and Bruce Jr. , who cried , less for the pain in his leg than for being hurt inconsiderately . No one had ever been mean to him before . " Oh , my dear , my clear , " the woman said , " I am sorry , I am truly sorry . Forgive me , " she implored . She kissed Bruce Jr . on the top of the head and rushed on . Batteries , candles , dried milk . Ellen had the presence of mind to think of some important things as she loaded the cart till it could not possibly carry another item . It was then that she paused in front of the cat-food section . There was no room , but she took a bag of it anyway . telling herself , " I 'm not giving up on anything . " The cash-register stalls were empty . No checkers , no baggers . " It do n't matter about the cart . Leave it where your car is , " Sal said as Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na do with money ? Pay me next time you see nae . " " Thank you . Thanks , " Ellen said to him as the press of emotions receded in her enough to wonder at this man , three pens in his shirt pocket protected by a translucent plastic guard , who had forsaken his family  --  he must have one  --  to come to the store , which he did n't own , to supervise its looting , to make sure the food went to the steady customers . Ellen wanted to say more to him , but he took the lead : " You go to Peck &; Rodney 's , the gun store . Get a gun on your way home . Hear ? " 56 " Yes , Sal . " He helped her get her cart out onto the street and shouted after her , " Do n't worry about the Russians . Watch out for the jiga-boos . " " I will , " Ellen heard herself saying as she pushed the cart down the sidewalk , with the baby complaining and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , dear baby . At length she got the supplies in the car and the baby in the baby seat and herself behind the steering wheel , on which she dropped her head for a few seconds . As Ellen opened her eyes and looked out of the windshield she saw the drugstore . Giving Bruce Jr . a toy and making sure he was strapped in , she ran across the street to the store , going immediately to the prescription counter . which was manned only by a high-school student . " Welcome to drug city , " he said . " I need a mood elevator , " Ellen said . " Who does n't ? " young Mr. Wiseass answered . " It 's one of those days , " he smirked . " Sleeping pills . Something . " " You can have anything you like , lady , if you have a prescription for it . " " Well , I do n't and I need something . I mean , I 'm not an abuser . I jog . I keep in very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back here where they mix these concoctions , that is , where they did when we still had a pharmacist , I 'd be happy to see if you do keep yourself in good condition . Then , if you 're not an abuser , we can see what 's in the bottles still left . " " You mean ... ? " Ellen did n't know what word to say next . " This way , please , " he said , bowing her through a small swinging counter gate and passing her through to the hidden part of the druggist 's work area . " Blouse first , " he said , and Ellen raised her hands to comply . The world-saving orgasmic flash , the life-giving sexual detonation , the positive explosion . Ellen imagined that was what she and this not-tooattractive adolescent , he of the cool , snide manner , could accomplish . ? " Oh , never mind , " he said , turning away from her . " I could n't get it on for Bo Derek today . " He went over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here and I 've stolen the combination ... I 've seen you in here before . I like older women . I 've watched you . Older women have beautiful skin . No zits . " He bent over and came up with a largish bottle of tablets . " You were all set to do it , were n't you ? Christ , yesterday I could n't have talked this way to anyone in the world but , oh , the things I could have done to you , lady . Now I can 57 She took the gun . She had never handled one before . Oh , it was heavy . Metal , gunmetal , so precisely made . Ellen could see it was a quality instrument , not the way they made so much junk these days . " I hope you do n't think I 'm prejudiced for wanting this . But so many , you know , inner-city people coming ... I just thought .. . " " There 're a few of us , " the man said , his liver-spotted hands running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon , as he would say , " there 're a few of us who 're going down to Tshimingo , you know , where Route 11 comes up from the city , to turn ' em away . I defended my country twice before , you know . " Ellen offered to pay , but the man refused . " There 's a complete breakdown happening . Social collapse . No one 's takin ' money anymore for their merchandise or nuthin ' . We might as well be livin ' under communism . You keep your money , lady , and you take care of this little soldier . You grow him up to be a good citizen . Do that for me . " A T HOME , the child and goods were unloaded in the house . Smedley began laying violent cat fists on the door , his demand to be let out . " No ! " Ellen rebuked him , " all my men here . " Except Bruce , and the phone still could not get through to the city . So she turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that NATO forces believed they could stabilize a front on the Elbe River , or , if worst came to worst , on the Weser . A cutaway to a commercial urging viewers to renew the war against cystic fibrosis and another telling women not to be ashamed to report a rape . Ellen had a beer on that one as Walter Cronkite returned , to repeat , as he said , an earlier bulletin about a statement from the Supreme Soviet , reassuring the world that Russia would never cast the first atomic stone . Ellen looked over at the playpen . The baby was zonked out , sleeping , a tranquil picture of curves and circles . How could straight limbs like arms and straight parts like toes be expressed in so many pink , fleshy spheres ? Not just a bad girl , she thought . looking at her child . Channel 5 could n't be the result of something she had done . Ellen walked outside . The neighborhood was still , quieter than on an ordinary afternoon .

" A pause . The repeated message that it was necessary to stay calm and stay put . Yes , there has been an attack , but it is nonatomic , repeat , not atomic , not an atomic attack but an attack by Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles armed with conventional explosives , nonatomic explosives .

He had n't heard . Meet the train . Meet the train . It occurred to Ellen she could now go next door . Bruce had called . She could get out of this damn place and be with somebody . But she could n't leave . Bruce might call back . Anyway , it was no time to abandon one 's home , although it stood to reason Indian Point would delay the evacuation of the inner city . No rapists , and therefore no rapes to be reported to the rape crisis center or the police . Was this the end of sex in America as we knew it ... her ? Walter Cronkite was talking now , saying that it was ironic that Diablo Canyon , " the object of protests because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an earthquake , should have been hit by a Russian rocket , but , as good fortune would have it , the Santana , the devil wind blowing from the desert toward the coast , has swept California clear and clean of any unhealthy radiation . " Night had fallen . She had gone to sleep in the kitchen chair listening to the transistor radio . Damn . Now Ellen was wide awake and she 'd /earned it was easier to face this when you were sleepy . The baby was calling for her in the dark and  --  yuk ! ? was he wet . A flashlight . Diapers . Ellen changed Bruce Jr . in the dark and then bethought herself . There has not been a successful copulation in America for two and a half days . Congratulations , Lance Devlin of Laramie , Wyoming , and Clara Apfel , a counter girl at Wendy 's in the same community . You are the last two Americans to make it to-58 gether . She shrieked at herself to stop it , stop that dirty , mind-wandering gibberish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train is always late , even without the possibility of atomic war . ergo I should bring a bottle of milk for Bruce Jr . and a bottle of Kahhia for me and the bottle of sleeping pills and the gun in case they are evacuating the inner city . After she had loaded the car and gotten ? the baby in it , Ellen remembered Smedley . She went back into the house and found him . picked him up , and dumped him in the car too . No streetlights and no traffic lights , so be careful going down the hilly roads to where the railroad station sits next to the Hudson , where the high cliffs line the water for miles and miles down to the city . Considering that people had been ordered to take cover , there were a lot of headlights , cars moving in the same direction as she . Ellen almost hit someone in an intersection . Even after the noise of the brakes had ceased in her head , she could n't collect herself . She pulled over to the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended , both hands tight on the steering wheel , when she heard Smedley purr against her ear . Disengaging the cat 's claws from her dress , she brought him around so that the woman and the animal were face to face . " Smedley , Smedley , Smedley , " Ellen said , crying as she opened the car door and put the animal out . As Ellen drove into the station parking lot , she saw it was packed with cars . Oh , my God , other wives waiting for other husbands . The last train for Tuxedo Junction , Larchmont , and other green places , and then in the distant sky an eruptive pinkness . She turned on the car radio , looking for the Emergency Broadcast System . After a long pause , there was a woman 's voice , recognizable but not recognizable , saying how inferior Russian technology was to ours . The hydrogen bomb meant to detonate at ground zero , the Empire State Building , had missed its target and exploded in the Jersey Meadows . Manhattan still stood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would mean for the train . Would the train be late ? Would the train run ? No one could say . Occasionally a young boy would put his ear to the rail and swear he could hear the train down the line , coming toward them . The first two times . people stirred and went to the platform ; now they waited in clusters , listening to their car radios , waiting for their husbands to come . The Emergency Broadcast System was optimistic . There was a communique from Europe that NATO forces were attacking , forward 59
