txt CHRISTMAS DAY , 1073 , was gloomy and cold In London . At dusk all the streets , from usually bustling Oxford Street to the most hidden cul de sac , were deserted . Suddenly we four Chicagoans spotted a light in a pub on a tucked  --  away corner , and raced toward it . Just as we got to the door it opened and a man in shirtsleeves came out . , He looked exactly the way the landlord of a pub should look . His face was red and his hair was black , His nose was sharp and over his shirt and ' trousers his large apron was very white . ' Sorry , " he told us . " We 're just about to close . I 'm locking up now . " " Do you know where we might find some Christmas dinner ? " No one had warned us , when we booked a charter flight , that most London restaurants close for the holiday and reservations for the few places that remain open have to be made months in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding the door half ' open . " Well now , that 's hard to say . " He looked at the four of us , standing there tall and miserable in our heavy coats . " All of you Americans , are you ? " " Hold on there , " a female voice called from inside , and a small woman with glasses and brown frizzed hair came out , holding a white poodle . " Reg , my dear , you know we ca n't turn anyone away on Christmas day . " All of us were bundled inside , served sherry , and sent upstairs . There We found a long table already set and several people in place around it . Among them were a'West Indian with his British wife . There was a scrawny fellow , mate on a freighter , in town on shore leave . . A fragile woman with bleached hair , now retired , used to be a dresser in the theater . Four additional places were quickly laid and yet the table was big enough so that we could all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turkey , and trim . ' mings , there was no doubt this was a true Christmas feast , with enough for all ,
