txt // treatment rapidly and without any severe effects such as increased mortality ( which is common with the starvation and water-deprivation methods ) . Feeding laying hens a low-sodium diet to induce a pause in egg production is gaining popularity . Naber et al . ( 1980 ) have shown that water and feed restriction is unnecessary to induce molt ; a low-sodium diet combined with light restriction ( 6 hr per day ) produced the desired effect with minimal trauma to the birds . Some additional feed restriction is advised in coastal areas where low-sodium diets may be difficult to obtain . Earlier studies have suggested that this technique may be more humane than starvation and water deprivation to induce molting , and that no specific behavioral problems appeared . Behavior problems such as toe and foot pecking have been reported under field conditions in birds on low-sodium diets . Hughes and Whitehead ( 1979 ) investigated this behavioral question and found that increased cannibalism occurred in two strains of birds receiving low ( 0.0003% ) and intermediate ( 0.03% ) levels of sodium , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The effect was more marked in the medium than in the light hybrids . High calcium levels had no effect . The authors concluded that the problem is a husbandry and management one and that , despite these adverse effects , " sodium depletion remains a useful method for inducing a pause in egg production . " Hughes and Whitehead also addressed the ethical question of depriving birds of an essential nutrient . They concluded that it has not yet been established how much suffering is involved when an animal is deprived of an essential nutrient , but it may be substantial if the deprivation period is a long one . They theorize that suffering is less in the case of sodium than in the case of calcium , for example , for the following reasons : 1 ) the very weak selection response suggests that there is little positive postingestional feedback , implying that the adverse effects that are being reversed are not severe ; 2 ) the birds do not lose body weight as they do under most nutritional stresses ; and 3 ) there is evidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into sodium homeostasis . Hughes and Whitehead suggest that use of low-sodium diets would be more acceptable from a welfare viewpoint if the birds were kept in small groups of no more than 4 per cage under reduced illumination . They noted that , in their experiments , " the incidence of pecking damage was heightened by the conditions under which the birds were housed , thus nullifying the welfare advantages normally associated with the sodium-depletion method . " Forced molting is another aspect of accelerated productivity that may be a further stressor to birds ; few live over 1 ? years ( they are killed after the first laying cycle wanes ) . Under less intensive systems a hen can produce for 5 or more years , with body-restoring natural rest periods between laying cycles . Under intensive farming , the hen has a shorter life span in the interests of economic efficiency . // Stocking Density Bird density ( number per cage ) continues to be a controversial issue in spite of the considerable research that has already been completed on this topic . Ruszler and Quisenberry ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size and bird density on the economic performance traits of laying hens , drew the following conclusions . At low density ( 465 cmZ/bird ) 5 ? 10 birds in a large cage gave the best results , whereas at high density ( ( ( 465 cmZ/bird ) best production was from birds at 2 , 3 , or 5 per cage . These results , like those of Heitman et al . ( 1961 ) with pigs , show that single factor analyses ( such as cage size or numbers per cage ) are questionable , and that multifactorial studies are needed since productivity is influenced by multiple causal variables . Ringer ( 1971 ) , in a detailed review of confinement rearing of poultry , notes that unfortunately economics often dictates the severity of the stress imposed by dust , noise , ammonia , etc. that commercial operators are willing to tolerate . He concludes that on overall performance there is a breaking point at densities where laying hens in battery cages are allowed less than 465 cmZ per bird . The National Research Council of Canada recommends housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although it is still common practice to keep 4 and even 5 birds in such a cage . Syme and Syme ( 1979 ) also concluded that density has a greater influence on egg production than group size . A study in Britain ( Hill , 1977 ) comparing three different group sizes and space allowances on productivity and profitability of two strains of Leghorn type layers should make the poultry industry reconsider present standards . Placing 3 birds per battery cage and allowing 387 cmZ per hen were found to be the best criteria for optimal productivity . Productivity and profits were shown to be lower in larger groups and with less space per bird , yet it is common practice to place 4 ? 6 birds in a cage and to allow each bird 345 cmZ or less . Bell ( Feedstuffs , March 2 , 1981 ) has shown that crowding of cage layers , often done to elevate temperature in order to lower feed consumption , will adversely affect productivity . Virtually irrespective of cage size , there is an average loss of 16 eggs per bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird added to the cage . Floor and feeder space also influence productivity , and Bell concludes , from his extensive review of many studies , that shallow cages , which offer more feeder space , are superior to conventional cages . He recommends the following standards : 310 cmZ or more floor space ; 4 hens per cage or less ; shallow cage depth ; and 10 cm or more feeder space . Even though crowding pays during high ( but not low ) margin periods , Bell believes that contracts with growers should be written that recognize the need for less crowding because , he contends , overcrowding of battery cages is a major factor in reduced profits for the egg industry . With regard to the birds ' welfare and producers ' optimal gain , 3 birds per 30.5 x 46 cm cage should be mandated . ' // B. L. Reid reported ( Feedstuffs , May 21 , 1979 ) that crowding laying hens in cages does not reduce the energy needed for maintenance by reducing physical activity , as is generally believed . Rather , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ density . Reid found that in experiments run with 3 , 5 , and 7 birds per 46 x 61 cm cage , net energy balance left from production decreased from 103 kcal to 85 kcal to 77 kcal as cage density increased . In the warmer southern states and in more northerly states in the summer , overcrowding should therefore be avoided . The practice of overcrowding in order to heat buildings with the birds ' own body heat in winter months may also be counterproductive in view of these findings . Providing better insulation and supplemental heat from a solar unit or heat exchanger may be a more humane , and in the long run more economical , way of housing battery hens . Overcrowding thwarts wing flapping , causes a reduction of bone strength of the humer , and thus increases susceptibility to fractures ( Simonsen and Vestergaard , 1978 ) . Overcrowding and cage design also affect the integument of birds , extensive feather damage being a significant economic and welfare concern ( Simonsen , 1980 ) . Hughes ( 1975a ) has published one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for maximal egg production . He shows that increasing colony size depresses egg production , increases mortalities and raises food consumption . Also decreasing the living space per bird depresses egg production , lowers food consumption and body weight gain , and increases mortalities . He concludes that colony size should always be small and , especially when food costs are high , the area allotted per bird should be large , in order to ensure the maximum biological efficiency of the bird . Hughes states clearly that " the economic studies all demonstrate that when feeding stuffs are expensive and the margin of income over cost is small , then returns are greatest when hens are stocked in small colonies with generous space allocations . " He also urges that " modern batteries should be designed to be inherently flexible in cage size and shape , allowing full advantage to be taken of developments in husbandry practices or genetic changes in birds without imposing unacceptable stress . " According to poultry scientist Dr. D. Conrad ( Feedstuffs , March 12 , 1979 ) , hens housed under crowded conditions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires 24 hr for an egg to be formed , sealed , and laid . The egg may crack or ridge within the oviduct while still soft . Normally the hen will repair this before it is laid , but under the pressure of social stress this natural repair mechanism may be inhibited . Eggshell quality is therefore potentially useful as a stress indicator . Several studies have also been done on the behavior aspects of overcrowding . According to Vestergaard ( 1978 ) , the wire floor of the battery cage reduces the incidence of actual fights but is correlated with an increase in aggressive pecking . Vestergaard ( in Moss , 19801 found , in a study of hens on // wire floors , that provision of a dust box was correlated with a marked decrease in the amount of aggressive pecking and threats . Prip ( 1980 ) said that in Denmark , 7 ? 8% of farms have had problems with hysteria in flocks kept on wire floors ( hence their wanting to change to cage systems ) , but Vestergaard reported that Danish farmers had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 per m2 or less . Hughes ( 1979 ) finds an increase in aggression in laying hens just before they are about to lay only when they are in battery cages , a finding that may be indicative of frustration and the fact that battery cages , as they are designed today , may not be conductive to the birds ' welfare . Hughes ( 1980 ) reports a reduction in time spent wing flapping , dust bathing , and ground scratching and more time head shaking , preening , and wing/leg stretching in hens in battery cages compared to those on litter . " A hen on litter constantly changes her behavior , whereas a caged hen continues doing the same thing over a long period . " Moving caged birds to deep litter at 30 weeks of age resulted in a sharp increase in some of these reduced behavior patterns , indicating that they can remain latent over a long period . Hughes also found that caging makes the birds less active and more flighty , as did crowding , and that it resulted in increased agitated pacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nesting behavior that may lead to aggressive pecking . Hughes noted also that aggression is reduced in battery cages partly because " threat displays require more space than the cage can provide , and partly because aggression is inhibited by close proximity to a dominant bird . " Both Hughes ( 1980 ) and Vestergaard ( 1978 ) emphasize that this reduction in aggression may be due to fear and is not therefore indicative of improved welfare . Both authors state that aggression is greater when birds are debeaked . Flightiness/hysteria is reduced by housing fewer birds together in cages and by providing perches and nest boxes . Craig ( 1982 ) also notes that increased feather loss , vent pecking , and cannibalism are likely to occur around the time when pullets begin to lay , possibly in relation to elevated levels of estrogen and progesterone . Reducing visual contact may help reduce the effects of overcrowding , hence the rationale behind raising poultry or hogs in semidarkness or red light . Visual contact can also be reduced in poultry by using opaque " spectacles " that pinch onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Report ( Brambell , 1965 ) in the U.K. spoke out against such devices , a substantial increase of up to 10% in egg production has been shown in one study ( Arbri et al. , 1978 ) . McBride ( 1975 ) has shown that restriction of space is not so critical as the way in which the living space is designed . By using baffles to break up a broiler breeder pen into smaller units , daily weight gains were enhanced at high stocking density ( 1 bird per 557 cm ' ) but not at lower density 1 I bird per 696 cm ' ) . Baffles or opaque partitions ' as described by Tauson ( 1978 ) 1 between battery cages may therefore he an effective and more humane // alternative to fitting plastic spectacles onto the birds . When large numbers of animals are massed together , as in deep-litter poultry operations , Kilgour ( 1975 ) suggests that , although the lights can be dimmed " perhaps better still the sheds can be constructed with a number of visual barriers which allow the signalling system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one time , rather than thousands of birds in the open shed . " Kilgour also offered some humane alternatives to keeping animals in semidarkness in order to reduce fighting and cannibalism . He noted that the presence of a dominant cock will inhibit others from fighting , and a broody hen will inhibit aggressive pecking as it develops in her growing chicks . He observed : " we have tossed both the alpha male and the broody hen out of our intensive systems and I wonder if pecking is not therefore aggravated among hens in situations where it would not normally occur . " Welfare Issues8 An innovative study by Dawkins ( 1977 ) allows us for the first time to question precisely how life in a battery cage may be for a laying hen . Battery-housed hens were given a T-maze choice situation between various parameters : 1 ) battery cage or an enclosed run in a garden ; 2 ) the garden run and an empty cage situated between two adjoining cages , each containing a hen unfamiliar to the subject hen ; 3 ) solitude or battery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battery cage ) or more room in the run . Most chose the freedom of the outside run and all eventually sought open space and solitude from the stresses of the battery cage system . Perhaps the key to defining optimal criteria for raising poultry and other farm animals is to study their natural inclinations and preferences . One can then establish a golden mean between what they want and what is economically feasible instead of basing husbandry criteria on tradition , intuition , and operator convenience . Two valuable studies from Norway ( Eskeland , 1977 , 1978 ) consider the behavioral and physiological criteria of hen welfare . Behavioral comparisons of birds kept at various densities in either battery-type cages or deep litter pens demonstrated the following results . At high stocking density in both systems , less time was spent feeding , especially for low-ranking birds , although the same amount of feed was consumed . Also , less time was spent preening and dust bathing . More preening was recorded at lower stocking densities in both pen and cage groups . At high density , more time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ litter pens , and there was more pecking at the wire in cages . Although debeaking is outlawed in Norway , birds with trimmed beaks in this study had no reduction in preening , spent less time pacing , ground scratching , and dust bathing , and spent more time resting . No cannibalism was seen in either normal or beak-dubbed birds . There was less tension in beakPoultry // trinuned groups , and less stress and therefore higher productivity in low-ranking birds . The second study ( Eskeland , 1978 ) measured several physiological indi-ces of welfare and compared hens under the following conditions : 6 or 12 hens per square meter of floor area in pens of 6 and 9 m2 ( low and high density , respectively ) and 2 , 6 , or 12 hens in 96 x 45 cm colony cages . ( In Norway , no less than 700 cm2 per bird is permitted , normal density thus being about 6 birds per battery cage . ) The other type of cage was a single-hen cage ( 40 x 38 cm ) in which 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was found that increased bird density in pens resulted in higher level of plasma corticosteroids , cholesterol , and glu-cose , decreased content of adrenal cholesterol , and hypertrophic adrenal and thyroid glands . No significant difference was found in plasma corticosteroids between different population densities in either of the two types of cages used , and glucose level increased significantly with increasing density in hens in both types of cages . Beak trimming lowered the plasma corticosteroids , and weights of adrenal and thyroid glands were reduced . Adrenal ascorbic acid content was depressed in normal as compared to beak-trimmed hens . When hens in colony cages and pens are compared with hens in the smaller ( single-hen ) cages , levels of plasma corticosteroids , cholesterol , glucose , and urea nitrogen were lower and adrenal cholesterol levels and weights of adrenal and thyroid glands were higher in hens in the smaller cages . Plasma cholesterol concentration was significantly higher in hens in colony cages . On the basis of the physiological data gathered , it was concluded that hens in the smaller cages , with no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than hens housed in colony cages . ' Brantas ( 1978 ) has reviewed his extensive comparative studies of battery cages , wire-floored pens , and deep litter housing systems for hens . He con-cluded that layer hen welfare problems included lack of space , lack of litter , lack of laying nests , lack of feeding space , lack of water , lack of social quietness , and cannibalism . These welfare impediments must be evaluated by taking into account the penetrance ( number of animals affected ) , the expres-sivity ( the continuousness of the impediment ) , and the seriousness ( the grade of the affection ) . Out of such an evaluation it is quite clear that battery cages must be evaluated worst , wire floors better , and litter housing best . The bases of these conclusions are shown in Table 2 . This constitutes an excellent model for evaluating and comparing the welfare of various husbandry systems from the animal/ethological point of view . Each factor , penetrance , expressivity , and seriousness , is graded on a scale of Ito 5 , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // animal suffering from a particular disadvantage may suffer continuously ( 5 ) or only very occasionally ( 1 ) . Also , being pecked to death is very different from being kept waiting for food . The total sums of the products of the scores for penetrance , expressivity , and seriousness for all the criteria is an approximation of the disadvantage of each housing system . Brantas emphasized that the figures are only tentative and do not pretend to be exact . Nevertheless , the differences between the sums are so great that it is Brantas ' opinion that the battery cages and wire floor systems must be rejected in the ethological evaluation of animal welfare . Brantas ' discounting of the birds ' need for " freedom " may be justifiable , since such a concept is anthropomorphic . A bird may want to escape or to have more living space at high stocking density , but to interpret such motivation as a need for freedom may be inaccurate . To support this contention , Dawkins ( 1978 ) has shown that hens prefer larger over smaller cages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is floored with grass and not wire mesh . In spite of their strong motivation to stay together , social attraction was weaker than their preference for an open run . Birds still chose to go into the run even if it meant moving away from companions . Future Trends Gowe ( 1977 ) has made some important inferences vis-a-vis the future of battery systems . He sees a gradual decrease in the use of antibiotics and other drugs in the egg industry as husbandry systems improve , implying that it is bad husbandry that necessitates their use . He expects disease losses to decrease , growth rates to increase , and egg production to increase as husbandry methods are improved , particularly following effective vaccination programs , selective breeding for adaptable and productive strains , and more effective control of diet and ventilation . Gowe raises a very salient point concerning stocking density . With a relatively high density , great economic savings can be made in the winter since little or no supplemental heat is needed in the battery house . The birds produce sufficient body heat to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be possible unless the ventilation was to be reduced , and this could be extremely detrimental to the birds ' health . Although attention to animal welfare and humane treatment may enhance productivity , there is unfortunately no inevitable correlation between the two . For example , Folsch ( 1977 ) has shown that poultry with extensive injuries ( such as extensive peck wounds or cage lacerations that expose bone and infected tissues ) may not be adversely affected according to a productivity criterion alone ( see also Tauson , 1978 ) . Of 26 severely injured battery hens , 5 ( Y ' 4i maintained normal egg production when placed in separate cages to protect them from further injury , even though the existing injuries received no treatment . The claim is often made by agribusiness that " productivity is an // infallible sign of health and general well-being . " This is certainly not true , and for ethical reasons alone husbandry systems should be designed to optimize both productivity and animal welfare ( see Chapter 6 ) . Luescher et al . ( 1982 ) have devised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be automatically raised or lowered to allow birds a given amount of perch time and freedom to move in the cage when perch is lowered . Preliminary findings indicate that birds with the perch system are more productive and in better feather than those without . Bareham ( 1976 ) described the Gleadthorpe or " Get-away " battery cage , which provides layers with a nest box and perch as well as a separate feeding area . Birds were not only more productive in this cage system , but also showed a more complete range of normal behaviors and reductions in aggression , feather picking , foot problems , nervousness , and stereotyped behaviors . Initial and final body weights and food consumption were comparable in birds kept in regular battery cages and in Gleadthorpe cages . J. Konig ( personal communication ) and Sainsbury and Sainsbury ( 1979 ) have also explored alternative systems of egg production where hens are not kept in battery cages . Although more labor intensive , such alternative systems as loose housing on deep litter in aviaries or covered straw yards certainly appear to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may be economically viable alternatives for many local marketing areas ( see Appendix B for details ) following further research improvements . Further research is also needed to prove the long-term financial advantages to the commercial producer in adopting a more humane system such as this . For example , a special egg grade at the retail level , indicating that the eggs were humanely produced , could offset producer 's additional costs since many conscientious and informed consumers would be willing to pay a little extra for such eggs . This has apparently occurred in Holland , where such a system is now in operation . In Switzerland , Austria , and Holland there have been widespread changes in egg production from battery systems to open housing ; a law was recently passed in Switzerland banning the sale and importation of battery-laid eggs . These studies demonstrate that commercial systems can be designed in which there is minimal modification of the behavior patterns of the chickens through provision of more spacious and complex environments . The more that the behavioral needs of farm animals are determined ? for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may come to understanding their needs and to designing facilities that optimize both production and the animals ' welfare . Recent studies in layer chickens lend some support to the concept of " nutritional wisdom " and of allowing farm stock to choose what they eat . Hunton ( Shaver , Focus , October 1979 ; see also Feedstuffs , November 26 , 1979 ) reports studies conducted in collaboration with S. L. Leeson and J. D. Summers of the University of Guelph . It was found that if layer chicks arc given // a choice between a high-energy ( iron ) and a high-protein ( soybean meal ) diet , they will so " formulate " their feed intake as to take in more and more protein with increasing age . This is in reverse of the standard practice of starting the chicks off on a high-protein diet and then gradually reducing the protein percentage as they mature . The " self-formulating " birds had essentially similar subsequent laying house performance . Adopting a " step-up " rather than " step-down " protein percentage formulation has the advantage of con-siderable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue of this study is that it demonstrates how critical experimental design can be . There are many hidden advantages when the animal itself is studied and when it is not constrained by limiting factors in the design . More studies are needed in which the animal is an integral part of the design as a collaborator rather than as a passive subject for experimental manipulation and control . New insights may then be gained , and traditional practices and concepts reevaluated . In contrast to layers , broiler chickens have a shorter and generally less stressful life . Broiler systems vary considerably ; in some the birds are finished at 7 weeks of age in flocks of 2000 to 5000 , and in others the birds are killed at 34 days ( as " Cornish " hens ) or kept for 92 days and sold as " roasters . " Twenty years ago it took 15 weeks and 5.4 kg of feed to make a 1.6 kg broiler . Now , after much research on genetics and nutrition , it takes 8 weeks and 1.8 kg of feed ( after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because broiler chickens now reach slaughter size at an age early enough to avoid what is regarded as the age-correlated peak in peck-order fighting , both male and female chicks are used in broiler production , thus reducing the unnecessary and often inhumane destruction of male chicks at the hatchery . Chickens maturing at a later age would most likely have to be debeaked again prior to slaughter and mortality rates would be higher if they were kept under the crowded conditions that are now commonplace on deep litter ( P. Siegel , personal communication ) . On arrival from the brooder ranch or unit , broiler chicks are usually kept in large flocks of 10 ? 75 thousand on deep litter ( see Figure 4 ) . They are given about 900 cm ' per bird and usually have 24-hr light to stimulate eating . Some ranches give 23-hr lighting and 1 hour of darkness to get the birds used to darkness ; otherwise , in a power failure , they may panic and injure each other . As the birds mature , and therefore increase in size , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A new practice is on the increase in the broiler industry ? a central company supplies all feed and chickens to farmers , who simply raise them to slaughter age . The company supplies veterinary field advisors and ready-mixed food ; computers are used in teh food mill to work out the most economic diet on // the basis of current market prices . Larger companies also do their own screening for pesticide contamination . Antibiotics are less often used in poultry feed than in hog feeds , but anticoccidia drugs are added to all poultry feeds . Arsenic is added to stimulate appetite and pesticides are used to control external parasites , notably feather mites . Drugs have to be withdrawn from the feed a certain period before marketing to ensure that they are not passed on to the consumer ; such federal regulations are not always effectively enforced , however . Although the rate of technological progress and increased performance in poultry ( egg and broiler production ) has been greatly facilitated by such vertical integration , Rogers ( 1979 ) states that " it is also argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husbandry has declined materially over time , " necessitating provision of performance standards and supervision of contract growers by companies involved in this type of poultry production . Cage-raised Broilers Because of increasing labor costs and the fact that catching crews are a " dying breed " ( according to a Holly Farms broiler chicken company executive ) , the time may come when broilers will be raised in cages . This would be a difficult and costly change-over for the broiler industry . More adaptable hybrid strains would have to be developed , not to mention the additional costs for installing rearing cages . Some of the advantages of cage systems that are often cited include high-density housing , since more birds can be kept per square meter of building in stacked cages than with conventional deep litter . Also , with higher densities , energy savings can be made since the birds will keep the building warm with their own body heat . The problem of breast blisters and enlarged , infected feather follicles in cage-raised broilers is associated with rough wire flooring , and therefore research is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrews ( 1978 ) compared the performance of broilers on conventional deep litter floors with others raised in cages on plastic or hard or soft rubber mats . Conventionally raised broilers were heavier ( i.e. , grew better ) , and had fewer- , missing wings compared to those raised in cages . Swollen feather follicles were most prevalent in those birds raised on plastic mats . By the end of the study the rubber mats had deteriorated badly , whereas the plastic ones were still in good condition . Tests have been done on the raising of broilers in battery-type cages that can be fork-lifted onto a truck and transported to the slaughterhouse . Although this eliminates the acute stress of capture in an open deep litter shed , the birds can suffer the same problems seen in laying hens in battery cages ? boredom , frustration , feather pecking , and blisters as their breasts ulcerate on the wire floor . Rizk et al . ( 1980 ) found that curled toes and perosislike leg abnormalities developed in cage-raised broilers and were correlated in most instances with // weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidence of these problems ( 12 ? 13% compared to 20 ? 60% ) . Reducing the photoperiod from a 24 hr day to a 12 hr day substantially reduced the incidence of leg deformities in cage-raised birds , but also reduced the growth rate . Deaton and co-workers ( Deaton , 1974 ) , in a comparative study of cage-reared versus floor-reared broilers , found a greater incidence of breast blisters and weak or deformed legs in cage-raised birds even though a resilient material was used over the wire floor . Although leg weakness was worse in cage-raised birds in the summer , these birds put on more weight during the summer than birds on deep litter , indicating that being on the hot and poorly ventilated deep litter is stressful and counterproductive during the hotter months . These researchers also cite other studies showing greater incidence of bone breakage in cage-raised broilers and " flabby " bodies and fragile bones in egg-laying stock maintained in cages . The lack of exercise in cage-raised birds may lead to birds having fragile bones , resulting in deformed feet , leg weaknesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producers are not in favor of the battery cage system because the only human advantage is the elimination of capture trauma for transportation . Husbandry Issues Stocking Density The tendency to overcrowd broiler chickens to in-crease productivity ( based on how much can be produced per square meter of floor space ) should be reconsidered in the light of recent research findings . Syme and Syme ( 1979 ) found that crowding stress ( i.e. , density ) , but not competition for feeding space or group size , had an adverse effect on weight gain . Proudfoot et al . ( 1979 ) studied the effects of four stocking densities on broiler carcass grade , the incidence of breast blisters , and other performance traits . They raised broilers at four stocking densities at 929 , 743 , 557 , and 372 cm2 of floor space per bird with 552 , 692 , 920 , and 1300 birds housed per treatment . ( No restrictions were imposed on feed and water space . ) They found that increased bird density resulted in a significant linear reduction in body weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a significant increase in the incidence of breast blisters in females , with the linear effect approaching significance for males . 11 Interestingly , with increased stocking density , the monetary returns per bird declined linearly . An opposite and significant effect occurred when returns were based on units of floor area . This underlines how critical it is to evaluate the parameters that are chosen to measure efficiency and productivity . // Ringer ( 1971 ) concludes from available data that " somewhere between 6.2 ? 4.65 cm/bird there exists a breaking point for optimum body weight by broiler density . " Stocking rates ( as determined for body heating ) are higher in winter and lower in summer in the warmer states , ranging from 600 cmZ to 900 cmZ per bird . Poultry production scientists are of a consensus that stocking den-sity down to 650 cmZ per bird has no adverse effects and that stocking density down to 465 cmZ per bird has only minor effects on weight gains , mortality , and feed efficiency . Producers who rate productivity on the basis of how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be subjecting their birds to unnecessary stress and suffering . A high mortality rate can be offset by overstocking , thus proving the point that productivity ( depending upon how it is assessed ) is not necessarily a reliable indicator of animal welfare . Another consequence of housing so many birds together is that the reactions of one or two birds can be magnified abnormally to create mass hysteria . A sudden disturbance can evoke mass panic , leading to the crushing or suffocation of many birds confined to such a relatively small space . Occasion-ally an epidemic of hysteria will afflict an overcrowded broiler house . As one poultry company specialist told this author , " it was like an ocean wave that swept from one end of the house and then to the other with birds piling up six or ten deep against one wall and then they would roll and tumble the length of the house ' til they piled up at the other end . This had been going on for several days until the farmer called me , and he looked like his birds : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hysteria was quickly corrected by putting a tranquilizer in the birds ' water trough , but several hundred birds had been crushed to death . Some researchers believe consideration should be given to providing broiler chickens not necessarily with more floor space but with more environ-mental complexity . Perches may make them less skittish , since birds that can not get off the ground to roost may be more nervous . " This might also reduce the incidence of breast blisters . Also , providing low upright floor panels with specific marks ( white circles , squares , triangles , etc. on a black back-ground ) at intervals may help the birds form smaller stable groups and have a sense of place . Such visual " placers " could also help in moving chicks out to fill the shed as they mature ; chicks raised next to familiar objects will tend to follow and stay close to them , and the panels can simply be moved farther apart . Artificial Lighting Artifical lighting is used to extend day length and to stimulate the birds to eat . This can be extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regimen of low illumination is used to reduce cannibalism . Some modern buildings are windowless in order to facilitate control of ligh intensity ; sudden power failures in such buildings can cause mass panic 4 Intensive Livestock Farming ijuries , and deaths . Continuous low illumination may be less beneficial than n intermittent light/dark cycle of 1:2 or 1:3 hr because the birds may be less ctive , feed less , and develop joint problems and other growth-related disorders hat might affect productivity through reduced activity . Sainsbury and Sainsbury ( 1979 ) make the following suggestions for mproving the lighting system for broiler chickens : There is an increasing interest now in growing broilers on the intermittent lighting patterns , which were once popular , as they appear capable of some improvement in growth rate , but more particularly in the food conversion ratio . They are capable of improving digestion with suitable rest periods , decreasing activity and reducing boredom eating ' . There will also be a reduction in electricity usage which will result in at least a marginal cost saving . A suitable lighting pattern would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 1 hr off in 24 hr ) 3 ? 5 weeks cycle 3 hr on and 2 hr off 5 ? 7 weeks cycle 2 hr on and 2 hr off 7 weeks cycle 1 hr on and 3 hr off onwards If , however , intermittent lighting programmes are used , it is vital that the highest generosity of feeder and drinker space available be provided , as the pressure will be greater . In a study entitled " Feeding behavior of chicks under three lighting regimens , " Squibb and Collier ( 1979 ) found that dark-adapted chicks grew just as well under 24-hr total darkness as they did under continuous illumination , although feed efficiency was poorest in those kept in total darkness . Those kept on a 12-hr light/dark cycle had poorer performance ; it was reasoned that they did not eat sufficient food during the 12-hr light period and did not eat when the lights were off . Those under total darkness and total light ate in shorter ( 12 ? 15 min/hr ) bouts than those on the light/dark cycle ( 25 min/hr ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three groups . Chicks spent more time eating when the caretaker was present between 8 and 9 A.M. This could be a confounding source of experimental error if not controlled . It is also worth further investigation from the point of view of routine husbandry practices : more frequent visits to the birds might actually stimulate growth . Many poultry producers spend as little time as possible with their birds and this could be counterproductive . Welfare Issues Broiler flocks are still not without problems . Outbreaks of cannibalism are not uncommon ( as with overcrowded layers on deep litter ) . With intense crowding , disease outbreaks are a constant threat , necessitating the use of vaccines and of antibiotics and other drugs in the feed . Heat stress in the summer and chilling ( luring winter , or stress and airsac disease from inadequate ventilation in // winter , are major husbandry and engineering concerns . Poor ventilation , especially when the rate of air exchange is reduced to conserve heat in winter , together with the dust and ammonia from the deep litter , make respiratory diseases a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " roaster " deep-litter farm in the winter ( when the ventilation rate is low for heating purposes ) resulted in acute respiratory problems for two of the observers because of the ammonia , humidity , and dust ( see Figure 5 ) . Cannibalism was high in these flocks , and many birds were crippled with viral arthritis . Improved insulation and ventilation design , water misters to create evaporation cooling in the summer , and improved monitoring and clearing of moisture and ammonia build-up are some of the areas where poultry engineers have made considerable progress . With good insulation in winter , fans can be used more often to ventilate the broiler house because more heat will be conserved . Also , stirring floor birds in hot weather could help disseminate heat and increase feeding . D. Hooge ( Broiler Topics , November/December , 1981 ) built a human dummy suspended from an overhead track to move up and down a broiler house to simulate a caretaker . A slight , but statistically nonsignificant , improvement was found in flock weight , feed conversion , and mortality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the additional equipment investment was not considered sufficiently cost effective . Ringer ( 1971 ) has provided an extensive review of the literature on optimal temperature , light , and ventilation for poultry production and has also reviewed poultry health aspects of " air pollution " in confinement buildings . From a welfare viewpoint , stressful ammonia levels are common in broiler houses , especially in winter , and the clear evidence of economic loss and poor health are obvious incentives to the broiler industry to instigate much-needed reforms . According to D. D. Carveney ( Feedstuffs , April 30 , 1979 ) , ammonia levels as low as 23 parts per million ( ppm ) in the broiler house can result in decreased growth rate , reduced feed efficiency , more low-grade carcasses , and a decrease in carcass shelf-life . Levels as low as 20 ? 50 ppm increase susceptibility to bronchitis , and higher levels cause keratoconjunctivitis and retarded growth . Broiler chicks are usually brooded on litter on which chickens have been previously grown . This could be stressful if the litter is producing ammonia and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at . ( 1979 ) showed that exposure to very low levels of ammonia for only the first 4 weeks of life will adversely affect the birds ' welfare , as reflected in reduced weight gains and lower body weights at market age . " Litter burns , " lesions on the breast bone that may or may not be associated with breast blisters , have been linked with high moisture content ( above 45% ) and ammonia levels in the litter ( M. Opitz , Feedstuffs , March 29 , 1982 ) . The complex etiology of the " sudden death syndrome , " or acute cardiac arrest in broiler chickens ( which is referred to by growers as " heart attack " or " flip-over " because the birds simply flip onto their backs and expire ) , has been // examined by Ononiwu and co-authors ( 1979 ) . Mortality rates were found to be particularly high in the biggest and fastest growing birds around 3 ? 4 weeks of age , and were higher in cockerels than pullets . Continuous lighting produced more sudden death syndrome mortalities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest that social ( crowding ) stress and aboveoptimal light intensity , which can lead to cannibalism , excitement , fighting , and piling , would adversely affect the more rapid-growing birds in a flock . The fertility of broiler breeding flocks is now lower than a decade ago . The problem may or may not be related to color sexing , where males that are sexually imprinted to birds with certain markings may be sexually inhibited by differently marked birds . This problem may also be related to the inverse correlation between rapid growth and fertility or to males becoming lame ( a common problem in breeder flocks ) or obese ( Siegel , 1983 ) . Hulan and Proudfoot ( 1981 ) and Hulan et al . ( 1980 ) have demonstrated the economic and welfare benefits of giving a low ( 16% ) protein " starter " diet to broilers and roasters , which results in cost savings , lower mortalities , and reduced lameness associated with too rapid growth early in life . Such a feeding regimen will also help reduce obesity , a common problem in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a genetic basis for broilers to voluntarily consume a volume of food that approached the capacity of their gastrointestinal tract , whereas layer strains eat more in accord with their metabolic needs . Sainsbury ( 1979 ) proposed that a combination of a highly concentrated diet low in fiber , together with other changes , has often produced metabolic disease problems and has contributed to behavioral stress problems such as cannibalism and feather pecking . Less intensive , more fibrous rations may not produce the very highest productivity , but this might be more than compensated for by the animals ' better health and an absence of metabolic and stress problems . Routine health procedures such as vaccinating the birds or medicating their feed , should be carefully re-evaluated since many accepted practices , in the light of recent advances in knowledge , may be highly questionable . For example , in a survey of " normal " broiler chicken mortalities , Blaxland and Borland ( 1977 ) discovered how stressful handling of birds for vaccination can be . They also found that routine vaccinations are of questionable value and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ susceptible to colisepticemia , a debilitating bacterial disease . The authors found that the vaccination procedures against Newcastle 's disease and infectious bronchitis were not producing adequate immunity against a possible challenge by a virulent virus of either type . Also , it was suggested that " the administration of these vaccines appeared to be causing stress sufficiently severe to be one of the factors predisposing to a high incidence of colisepticaemia . " On the basis of such studies , it seems that every routine husbandry procedure needs to be // // properly researched and evaluated in relation to the pluricausal , multifactorial etiology of many poultry diseases and behavior problems . Future advances in the broiler industry may lead to birds being ready for slaughter by 6 weeks of age . Since vaccinations and debeaking cause a 1 ? 2-day loss in growth , the efficacy of these practices ( possibly with the exception of vaccinating against Marek 's disease ) needs to be reconsidered . There is a growing trend to let an epidemic on a broiler farm takes its course and , rather than treating afflicted birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medication in feeds ( except for coccidiosis ) may soon be dropped for both economic and human health reasons . Fewer vaccinations , some of which may be immunosuppressants , may also be more economical and better for the birds ' general health . The key to health is in good preventive husbandry practices ( especially adequate ventilation and temperature control ) . For example , contract farmers receive bonus incentives for producing " clean " birds . With the right management incentives , corporate integrators can do much to improve the quality of husbandry , thereby enhancing the quality of production , as well as the degree of humaneness in the rearing , transporting , and processing of broilers . GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS FOR HUSBANDRY According to Poultry Tribune ( July , 1977 ) " basic poultry management i.e. , good husbandry has disappeared . " They quote a farmer 's wife who stated at a meeting , " You egg farmers are so entangled in today 's marketing problems ... that you are neglecting good poultry management . " A recent survey by the author ( Fox , 1981 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare concern in the poultry industry showed that the highest ranked concerns are : 1 ) methods used to destroy chicks at hatcheries ; 2 ) forced molting of laying hens , e.g. , starvation stress for several days ; 3 ) battery cages for laying hens and wire cages ? battery systems for broilers ; and 4 ) slaughter methods . ( Some poultry scientists also contend that the trauma of catching broilers prior to shipment for slaughter is the most serious welfare concern ; see Chapter 4 . ) Questionable welfare issues warranting more research were : 1 ) cannibalism and vent picking ; 2 ) foot problems and breast blisters in hens in battery cages ; 3 ) improved ventilation in broiler houses ; and 4 ) summer heat stress and overcrowding of broilers . The U.S. Animal Welfare Act states that the animal 's owner " shall provide sufficient space to allow each animal to make normal postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement . " All livestock , including poultry , are excepted from this act , but a poultry ranch that has laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally incapable of making some improvements . Reducing the numbers of birds per cage , removing ; cage partitions to double cage size , and providing ; perches and nest boxes could improve the quality of life and quality of production per individual bird . Animal suffering and privation is not justified by the economic savings of high ( but not maximal ) overall mass production , which buffers , if not masks , the relatively low productivity per bird . Improvements in debeaking , improved husbandry , and selective breeding to reduce the necessity of debeaking are needed . The common practice of forced molting also requires attention . Since the mechanisms are hormonal , research on neuroendocrine trigger mechanisms that can be activated without resorting to prolonged water deprivation and starvation should be explored as potentially more humane alternatives . A most startling finding with regard to the influence of environmental temperature on antibody production raises concern over the high temperatures ( and humidity ) in which confined animals are often kept ( Rao and Glick , 1977 ) . Chronic exposure of chickens to cold ( 45 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 90 ? F and above ) had a depressant effect . It is not known how applicable these findings are to other species but it should be of great concern . It may well be that a normal cyclic pattern ( with evening " cool off " ) , mimicking natural diurnal variations in temperature , may be optimal for confined livestock . Improvements in husbandry and humane care may well reduce mortalities and increase profits such that there would be no increased costs in the long run . However , it should also be emphasized that , in the U.S. , government regulations ( such as EPA and OSHA standards ) have raised the investment necessary to start a farm and have essentially eliminated the possibility of broiler processing by those who do not have considerable capital : a " Catch-22 " situation for the small and would-be independent producer . Chapter 2 Swine Production and Husbandry GENERAL OVERVIEW : SWINE PRODUCTION IN THE U.S. The number of pigs raised each year for human consumption in the U.S. is around 84.6 million , with the per capita annual consumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A recent survey by Rhodes , Stemme , and Grimes ( Feedstuffs , March 5 , 1979 ) shows that there is an increase in the size of commercial hog farms ( of 1340 large-volume producers responding to the survey , the average size of the operation was 10,192 head for 1978 ) . An estimated 10% of all operations designated as corporations were family owned . On some farms , pigs are still raised and fattened in the old tradition in fields or dirt lots with a movable ark or stye for shelter . However , the growing trend is to raise pigs entirely indoors under controlled conditions . An estimated 8700 new confinement buildings were constructed in the U.S. in 1963 compared to some 30,000 to 40,000 in 1973 , reflecting a rapid change in the cornbelt states from the more traditional methods of pig production . Table 3 shows the types of facilities utilized in the U.S. as a whole and in the various hog-raising regions . The most prevalent system is total confinement with environmental control . Partial slats with liquid manure handling was the most widespread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented 28.3% of reporting operations , and 30.2% handled solid waste and 23.6% utilized a liquid flush system . Arsdall and Gilliam ( 1979 ) , in a review of pork production in the U.S. , note that the extra stress from raising pigs in confinement , " an increasing production practice over time , also can adversely affect animal performance . " The number of pigs farrowed per litter increased from 6.3 between 1940 and 1949 to 6.8 between 1950 and 1959 . Between 1960 and 1969 a national average of 7.2 was attained , and for 1970 to 1978 the figure remained the same at 7.2 . However , death losses have actually increased . Losses averaged 2% of production before the advent of antibiotics and decreased subsequently to 1 ? 2% in the mid- I 960s . However , Arsdall and Gilliam ( 1979 ) found that " subsequently losses rose toward the 2 percent level with more intensive confinement , // increased production in the hazardous seasons of the year , and much larger numbers handled per worker . " Breeding Stock Sometimes breeding sows may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are then taken indoors , but increasingly breeding stock are kept indoors throughout their lives ( see Figure 6 ) . Some farms will put several sows or gilts together in the same pen in groups of 5 to 20 where they have freedom of movement and are able to interact socially . Being indoors all the time is claimed to be more conducive to the sows ' well-being , since they will not be exposed to the elements nor will they pick up parasites and other diseases from overused and contaminated fields . On many pig farms the sows are released to run with the boar when they are in heat , after which they are tied up or penned again until they are ready to deliver . Larger farms are now employing artificial insemination , making for a more efficient use of the boar ( since the semen can be diluted and one ejaculate used for several sows ) . With such a system , the sows may remain tethered or penned constantly since there is no need to free them to be with the boar for breeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sows using Pros taglandins so that labor can be timed to occur when an attendant can be on hand , thus reducing labor difficulties and piglet mortalities . The effects of artificially inducing labor with such drugs remain to be determined . Boars are generally kept in a separate unit in single pens . The social deprivation imposed on these animals can be detrimental to libido and sperm count . Also , sows deprived of the social and pheromonal ( body odor ) stimu lation of a boar may also have lowered fertility and fecundity . Lowered fertility in confined sows and boars is a well-recognized problem ( Kiley-Worthington , 1977 ) . Farrowing When the sows are due to deliver , they are driven into the farrowing unit and placed in separate stalls ( see Figure 7 ) . The stall design varies greatly . Many farms use the Swedish " iron maid , " a 61 x 183 cm tubular iron stall in which the sow is confined and unable to turn around . She may or may not be released from this when the piglets are 4 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crated until the piglets are weaned . Other farrowing systems involve variations on iron crate design , wherein the sow may be chained or constrained by a yoke or by the narrowness of the crate . The object of restricting the sow 's movements in these ways is to prevent accidently lying on and crushing of the piglets. ' // If the pen has a slatted floor , strips may be placed between the slats to stop the piglets from falling through and injuring themselves , at least during the first week . Few farms provide hay or straw nest material and a crawl-in nest box for the piglets . This helps cut down mortalities but does involve some additional labor costs and the risk of blocked drains . A warm heater pad or infrared light is used to provide the piglets with warmth , since the sow is unable to construct a warm nest for them because she is not usually provided bedding material for this purpose . Indeed , it is highly unusual to see any bedding at all in modern pig farms , even for heavy sows kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was found to be a major contributing factor in nipple necrosis , a common problem in piglets . Pigs farrowed on slatted concrete floors had a higher incidence of necrosis , the lowest incidence being in pigs reared on pasture or in farrowing facilities having plastic-coated expanded metal floors . The provision of bedding for 2 or 3 days postfarrowing significantly reduced the incidence of this problem from 27.2% to 5.2% for piglets reared on concrete floors ( bedding also reduced abrasions of the knees and hocks ) . Research by Baardson and Froseth ( Feedstuffs , June 29 , 1981 ) has shown that nipple necrosis is of economic importance because it causes total or partial loss of milk production in the affected teats , thus decreasing the value of replacement sows . Breeds with longer and more prominent nipples were more affected than other breeds , and the incidence of nipple necrosis was higher in females than in males . Weaning Weaning is accomplished as early as possible , around 3 to 5 weeks of age , and the sow is bred again as soon as she comes into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piglets receive their first series of vaccinations and have their tusks snipped and tails docked . Young boars are castrated at 7 to 10 days of age . This habitual practice , performed without anesthetic and often resulting in temporary growth setbacks and more serious secondary infections , is a costly practice that could probably be eliminated . Castration is thought to be of value in reducing aggression in finishing hogs ; however , such surgery is performed primarily to reduce the development of adult sexual pheromones , which taint the meat and which consumers find disagreeable . Since pigs mature more rapidly now than in the past , the age at which they are slaughtered is generally such that boars would still be immature and have very little taint in their meat ( Kiley-Worthington , 1977 ) . Therefore , the swine industry would like to see this outmoded procedure eliminated . Pig International ( November/December 1977 ) ran a major editorial on this subject . Apparently castrating male pigs at or soon after birth is being characterized in many countries today as a waste of ' time and effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , for no return to the producer . Entire boars grow faster and use feed more efficiently than barrows and gilts , and carcasses are leaner , need little or no trimming of excess fat , and have a higher meat yield . Separate rearing of boars and gilts on the farm , and adjusted abattoir techniques , may be necessary if all male pigs were kept entire for finishing , but such added costs would be offset by lower feed costs and leaner carcasses . This controversial issue can not be easily resolved , since changes in age and weight at slaughter and in public and packer acceptance of " boar " meat are needed . The trend toward early weaning of piglets in order to breed the sow sooner ( because she quickly comes into heat once the litter is removed ) has some major contraindications . The earlier the piglets are weaned , the greater can be their growth delay . Pigs weaned at 2 or 3 weeks of age were not equal in weight to pigs weaned at 4 weeks until they attain 6 weeks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the piglets may suffer lowered adaptability to the postweaning environment . Attempting to improve the reproductive efficiency of the sow as a breeding unit by early weaning therefore has serious costs , not the least being the stress and suffering to immature piglets . Bareham and Vestergaard ( 1981 ) , in their review of the deleterious consequences of early weaning of piglets , report a number of abnormal behavior patterns including massaging and playing with the tongue and massaging ( belly nosing ) and sucking the bellies and appendages of other piglets , which can lead to damage to the skin and infection . Such behavior is related to hunger and non-nutritive oral activity resulting from deprivation of normal suckling behavior . Early-weaned piglets are more emotional ( in open field tests ) than those raised with the sow . Increased adrenal weight and pathological changes in the small intestine have been also attributed to the stress of early weaning . Coalson reports that piglets should not be weaned until around 5 weeks of age if they do not have an optimal environment ( Feedstuffs , March 5 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 3 weeks ) was designated as consisting of 100% underslat ventilation and flush systems with excellent temperature control . The flooring recommended was steel , plastic , or aluminum slats or expanded metal . A " fair " environment ( for weaning at 4 weeks ) was described as consisting of one-third slats , two-thirds solid concrete flooring , solid partitions , electric heat on the floor , and good temperature control . A " poor " environment was described as consisting of one-third slats , two-thirds solid concrete flooring , solid partitions , and poor ventilation and temperature control . Laying down an expanded metal flooring over the slats and solid concrete floor can do much to enhance the piglets ' welfare and growth in these " fair " and " poor " categories , and adopting an " all in , all out " nursery facility , which makes thorough disinfecting between batches possible , is advisable . There is a new trend toward weaning piglets early and raising them in wire // battery cages , much like the stacked-cage system used for poultry . Ruth Harrison ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pigmamma " system , which is also in use in Europe , as follows : This is a cage system for newborn piglets . The cages are banked to allow for automatic feeding , watering , and cleaning , in a similar way to battery cages for laying hens . Individual cages are 2 ' 0 " deep by 1 ' 0 " wide by 1 ' 0 " high . Piglets are put in them for 28 days and then moved into pens . Milk substitutes are fed automatically into bowls in each cage every 90 minutes . Piglets are kept in the dark except for a few minutes at each feed time . Pig American ( July/August , 1978 ) describes research on a system , new to the U.S. , of raising weaned piglets on a flat deck . These nursing pens are raised off the ground and are therefore warmer than on-the-floor concrete pens ( see Figure 8 ) . Necessarily , pigs above may defecate upon those below ; however , since those below may eat such excrement , which contains some undigested food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , personal communication ) . The piglets are kept in a 1.2 x 2.4 m pen on 10-gauge 3/4 " expanded metal flooring with a 60 cm wide solid overlay in the center of the pen . Although these piglets gained 22% faster and were 11% more efficient than those raised on concrete slats , the research report stated that they require only 0.16 ? 0.19 m2 per pig to 20 kg body weight , whereas conventional rearing systems normally require 0.28 ? 0.37 m2 per pig . Greater productivity notwithstanding , to allow such little space per pig should be questioned on humane grounds . It was claimed that Coalson 's criteria for optimal weaning environments could be met by well-designed elevated flat deck pens ( see Reese and coauthors , Feedstuffs , March 9 , 1979 ) . Researchers recommended keeping small groups of littermates together ( or two litters that have had time to mix between contiguous sows prior to weaning ) . Large or mixed groups may suffer from crowding stress , since the flat decks used are around 1.2 x 1.2 m or 1.2 x 2.4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 0.2 m2 of floor space per pig up to 20 ? 23 kg . This is 0.1 m2 less than recommended for other nursery systems , which may be pushing the pigs ' adaptive responses to the limit . Kornegay et al . ( 1980 ) have studied the performance of 21- to 28-day-old piglets housed in triple deck cages . They concluded that 10 pigs can be housed per 1.2 x 1.2 m cage for 5 ? 12 kg pigs and that a maximum of 8 pigs may be housed at weights from 12 to 22 kg . Performance was similar for pigs on expanded metal , woven wire , and quarry wire ( oil-tempered wire cloth ) floors , although pigs had more foot cracks , abrasions , and cuts on the latter surface . Algers ( 1980 ) finds that piglets weaned at 3 weeks of age and kept in cages had significantly inferior health status at the age of 3 ? 8 weeks than 3 ? 8-week-old piglets kept with the sow until 6 weeks , and also were in poorer // health than piglets 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks and kept in pens with the opportunity to choose separate eating , lying , and dunging areas . The lowered health consisted mainly of a significantly higher incidence of traumatic injuries . These injuries were attributed partially to the nature of the cage design and partially to behavior changes in the piglets . These behavior changes were attributed to the barren environment offered to the piglets in the cages in combination with the stress of being weaned at 3 weeks of age . Algers concludes that the pathological changes that characterized the deteriorated state of health in piglets kept in cages were such that they would seem to have caused the animals unnecessary suffering . Although , several companies in the U.S. are now promoting them , in Europe , these flat deck systems are losing popularity . The flat deck has been used in Denmark for several years following the practice of early weaning of piglets ( at 3 ? 4 weeks ) . No more than 9 ? 12 pigs per group should be kept together , since with larger groups on flat decks , tail biting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is considered essential to have an " all in , all out " rearing system since , with different age groups on flat decks in the same building , problems can arise . Feed intake should be restricted for at least the first 4 days on the deck , since ad-lib feeding can result in severe diarrhea . Alarm systems to indicate a power failure in treating or ventilation are essential with the flat deck system , but unnecessary for the more laborintensive " two-climate " early-weaning system . After detailed studies the flat deck system is now being questioned by several scientists . The research of Dr. Paul Holmgaard of the Danish Building Research Institute has been reported in some detail in Pig International ( January/February 1978 ) ( see also Holmgaard and Feenstra , 1978 ) . On the basis of extensive comparative studies , he favors a Danish " two-climate " pen layout over the flat-deck system . The former consists of an insulated and unheated piggery where pigs can come out of their boxes to a slatted central dunging area . In contrast , the raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most confinement houses , the piglets are usually kept in semidarkness on expanded metal or concrete slat floors over a liquid manure pit or flush system and are not provided bedding . Dr. Holmgaard states that such a system is expensive and can represent a stress to both pigs and staff . Bure ( 1981 ) , van Patten ( 1981 ) , and Schmidt and Adler ( 1981 ) , in independent studies , report that battery-caged piglets show a disrupted resting rhythm , a high incidence of abnormal behaviors ( excessive nibbling , rooting , massaging , sucking , and tail biting ) , and a marked decrease in play behavior . Mortalities are significantly higher , but daily gains are better than in piglets raised in an open barn on straw . All these authors concluded that early weaning and battery-cage rearing are stressful and not conducive to the piglets ' welfare and that alternative systems need to be developed . Swine Production and Husbandry 51 Fattening/Finishing The piglets are moved to nursery pens after weaning ( 20 ? 25 pigs per 1 x 4 m pen ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finishing " pens ( see Figure 9 ) . As they grow , they may be broken up into smaller groups . For example , they may initially be stocked at 75 piglets to a 3 x 12 m pen and later reduced to 40 to 45 pigs in the same size pen . This stocking density , irrespective of pen size , may be too great . Lindvall ( 1981 ) has shown that average daily gain was adversely affected , postweaning , with increased stocking density , whereas the efficiency of gain ( feed per unit of gain ) was not adversely affected . The average piglet is finished and ready for slaughter at about 100 ? 113 kg . They are raised under varying degrees of confinement ( see Table 3 ) . Some houses are windowless , with electric lights and fans controlling illumination and ventilation . Many confinement buildings have a waste disposal gutter that can be flushed out regularly . Unfortunately , this leads to high humidity on top of high temperatures in the summer . Humidity is further increased by spraying the pigs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a manure pit are also popular , but there are problems with humidity and build-up of gases . It has been found that 35 ? 60% of all pigs raised in confinement buildings are affected with mycoplasmic pneumonia to the point where weight gain is adversely affected ; this may be a factor in so-called building fatigue ( see below ) . Use of slats in finishing pens ( as well as in flat deck systems ) can create additional problems . Holmgaard and coworkers ( Pig International , July 1977 ) have shown a decreasing health status with increasing use of slats . Feed conversion and daily weight gains are better in pigs kept on straw-bedded concrete floors than in pens where slats made up 27% or more of the floor area ( i.e. , slats were restricted to the dunging area ) . The latter were preferable to the 100% slatted floor design . Tail biting increased if straw was not provided and also increased with increasing percentage of slatted flooring . Danish re-searchers believe that because of the greater incidence of health problems such as diarrhea and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social ranking of the pigs occurs , which leads to increased aggression and tail biting . Sig-nificantly , although the pigs showed an unstable social order when they were sick , a stable hierarchy ( and therefore reduced aggression ) was seen once they were healthy again and were kept on a straw-covered solid floor . " Social confusion " may also result from high stocking density , as field observations in Pig American ( July/August 1977 ) suggest . Young pigs were reported to be unable to recognize more than 29 other individuals in a group , 13 which means pigs in batches of 30 or fewer suffer less from stress and grow // faster than those kept in batches of 50 or 60 . One English producer , who has adapted his housing ideas accordingly , says " we are getting heavier pigs at a lower cost per pound liveweight from the new unit , mainly because of the smaller groups in the weaner pools . " Finishing houses are costly to heat and therefore many rely on the body heat generated by the animals to keep the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventilation ( rate of air exchange ) may be insufficient to keep the animals cool and comfortable in the summer . Second , the ventilation rate must be reduced in winter and this may lead to stagnant and ammoniated air , which stresses the pigs and increases their susceptibility to pneumonia . Hot and humid air in the summer may act as a similar stressor and also intensify the effects of crowding stress , leading to increased fighting , loss of condition , and secondary disease problems . New energy sources , notably solar heating for pig houses and methane gas derived from anaerobic incubator tanks filled with liquid manure , are still at the research and development phase . In a significant comparative study of an environmentally controlled total confinement system and a modified open front system for hog production , Fritschen ( 1973a ) concluded that , on a least-cost basis , the latter system is as efficient , production-wise , as total confinement during the winter months , and is superior in the summer months . It is less costly to construct and less prone to equipment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more vulnerable to birds and flies in the summer . Odors are less of a problem than in total confinement systems . Total confinement for hogs would therefore seem to be a relatively inefficient and questionable practice . In the 1979 Nebraska Swine Report ( summarized in Feedstuffs , February 12 , 1979 ) two significant findings were published that may help move the hog industry away from total confinement rearing and adding antibiotics to the feed . In a modified open front , gravity-ventilated building , fattening hogs performed equally as well as those in an environmentally regulated building ( other recent studies indicate that in the latter system , growth rates may actually be depressed ) . The most significant difference noted was the weekly utility cost of 56 cents for the open front system compared to $169 for the environmentally regulated system . Escalating energy cost may soon result in an end to total confinement , environmentally regulated hog buildings . Considering the many limitations of confinement hog operations , one may well wonder what advantages there may in fact be . Sprouse et al . ( 1975 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded that advantages of the outdoor system were the low fixed investment cost per pig , the less intensive management required , and the greater flexibility compared to the confinement system . However , the confinement system would allow experienced producers with available capital to expand more rapidly and to produce a greater volume of hogs . In other words , in spite of their many disadvantages and obvious welfare concerns , confinement systems as mass 4 Intensive Livestock Farming roduction factory-scale operations have a competitive edge over other sys.Nms , and are likely to increase in popularity ; hence the need for a rigorous assessment of hidden costs and animal health and welfare . Cunha ( 1978 ) states : Much remains to be learned about handling sows in complete confinement . A top swine producer using high-quality pasture can wean 10 pigs per litter . Until a top swine producer can wean equal numbers in complete confinement , there are problems to be solved . The top producers are weaning 8-8. 6 pigs per litter in confinement away from pasture and dirt . They are also experiencing problems with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per conception , increased sterility , and decreased litter size . Reproduction appears satisfactory when sows are first moved from pasture into confinement , but reproductive problems usually start to occur after the first or second litter . In a more in-depth , economic evaluation of total and partial confinement Ind pasture swine production systems , Kliebenstein and Sleper ( 1980 ) drew the ' ollowing conclusions : 1 ) the pasture system had the lowest per-sow ownership ; osts but had the highest feed costs per sow ; 2 ) during relatively low input posts ? output prices , the pasture system provided the highest return above all : osts per sow ; 3 ) during relatively high input costs-output prices partial : onfinement gave best profits ; 4 ) for given levels of market hogs produced , the partial confinement and pasture systems provided the highest level of profits per sow , fewer pigs per sow per year being needed to break even for these systems than for total confinement ; and 5 ) the pasture system required the lowest level of feed efficiency to break even . Furthermore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest return above all costs per sow for all swine price and feed cost levels involved . Total confinement systems had the greatest economic risks associated with market price fluctuations , and in order to recoup costs these systems need to be utilized continuously . CONFINEMENT PROBLEMS Stocking Density Heitman et al . ( 1961 ) , in a study of space allowance and performance in finishing hogs , found that , given more space , pigs were more active , spent less time resting and sleeping , and had better feed conversion and faster growth rates than those with less space ( 0.5 mz versus 0.9 or 1.9 mZ each ) . With increasing numbers of pigs per pen ( 3 , 6 , or 12 ) they found better feed conversion and lowered food consumption . These findings , because of the interacting effects of pen size and population size per pen , show the importance of multifactorial analyses . The interactions between the size of the group and the density of animals ( how much space is allowed per animal ) have also received some attention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) conclude that , with less than 0.6 m ' of // floor space per pig , productivity will be adversely affected . Group weight gain may decrease in groups over 12 in number ( pigs seeming to be more efficient and productive in small groups ) , yet it is common practice to raise hogs in pens of 20 to 40 or more . Gehlback et al . ( 1966 ) have made recommendations for minimum floor space allowances for growing-finishing swine in confinement housing , and have found that smaller groups of pigs ( 8 or 12 ) gained sig nificantly faster than 16 pig groups in warmer weather . An optimal mix of both density and group size seems to be essential for both animal welfare and productivity . Wingset ( Feedstuffs , July 20 , 1981 ) has shown that hogs given 1.9 mz of space in confinement per animal gained faster and reached market weights quicker and on less feed than hogs given 1.4 m2 or 0.9 m2 each . Tail biting and lameness were also reduced by providing more space . Wingset concluded that : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per animal in their facilities because rising construction costs make larger total confinement areas prohibitively expensive . However , with outdoor confinement the investment per hog in 20 sq . ft. of concrete is only $5.70 greater than pouring 10 sq . ft. per animal . Wahlstrom and Libal ( Feedstuffs , May 10 , 1982 ) doubled the pen space of pigs in total confinement ( allowing 1.3 per pig ) during the finishing period . These pigs consumed more feed and gained faster than pigs given 0.66 m2 , thus demonstrating that the standard 0.7 m2 allowance per pig is suboptimal . Plumlee and coworkers at Purdue University ( 1976 ) have shown that increasing pig density will reduce feed conversion rates after the pigs have reached 68 kg . Preliminary studies by Kelly and coworkers ( Feedstuffs , May 3 , 1982 ) show that crowded pigs ate and grew less than controls and started to develop stomach ulcers , even though changes in plasma cortisol , an anticipated stress indicator , were not found . ' ' Limited access to feeder space was controlled for and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Oct. 12 , 1981 ) have found that simply moving pigs from pen to pen in the growing-finishing period resulted in faster gains . Changing pens stimulated the animals ' appetites , confirming the investigators ' hypothesis that " boredom " depresses the feed intake of confinement-reared swine . Growth Depression and " Building Fatigue " The length of time spent in confinement can be related to the health and growth rate of pigs . Confinement rearing ( versus group rearing ) in hogs resulted in reduced average daily gain and impaired feed conversion efficiency . Indi vidually penned animals developed osteoporosis , lameness , or posterior weak ness , which was attributed to lack of exercise with resultant poor muscle tone . // Elliot and Doige ( 1973 ) concluded that these findings " could have important implications with respect to leg problems in sows confined in tie-stalls or crates for long periods with minimal exercise . " Freeden and Sather ( 1978 ) contribute further to the increasing body of evidence that confinement rearing can have adverse effects on the welfare of growing pigs . Three populations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 119 male castrates ) reared in confinement were examined after slaughter . The frequency of moderate to severe damage joint damage ranged from 12% to 50% , and the highest frequency of fully normal cartilage in any population was only 20% . The longer the duration of confinement , the greater was the incidence and severity of joint abnormalities , and individual confinement produced greater damage than confinement in groups . The incidence of joint pathology was significantly reduced in one population that had been taken out of confinement and put out to pasture . Thus group feeding , reduction in the amount of time spent in confinement , and access to pasture will lower the incidence of joint damage and facilitate cartilage repair in confinementcrippled hogs . Moving pigs from confinement ( a totally enclosed building ) to an open front facility at various stages of growth will significantly increase daily gain , according to reports at the South Dakota State University 's 22nd Annual Swine Day . These reports are some of the first to demonstrate that continuous total confinement rearing of hogs may be economically counterproductive , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either an open front building ( uninsulated wooden houses ) with two 2.4 x 1.8 m pens and an outside concrete area ( 1.8 x 3.7 m ) where feeders and water were located or in an enclosed confinement building ( insulated , ventilated , with totally slatted floors , pens 1.1 x 2.4 m excluding self-feeder area ) . Pigs housed in the open front building gained 11% faster daily between 23 and 54 kg of weight . Moving pigs from the enclosed to open front buildings at 54 kg improved gain compared to those left inside during this period . Pigs moved to the enclosed building did not gain as well as those left outside . Gains were also improved when pigs were moved to outside lots at 73 kg . Although feed conversion efficiency did not seem to be affected by the type of housing , feed consumption was greater for pigs housed outside . Fritschen ( in Hog Farm Management , pp. 92 ? 94 , 1979 ) has drawn similar conclusions from his extensive studies of growth rates in finishing pigs . Pigs in complete confinement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 63 kg of body weight . Animals kept in a modified open front building performed better , even in winter , than those kept in an environmentally controlled ( i.e. , closed ) building ( see Figure 10 ) . Fritschen states that : If we assume that arrested growth is more common in environmentally regulated buildings we may begin to explain why this occurs . In reality , is n't part of the problem in some buildings due to the constant , mundane , consistent conditions // where the extremely narrow range of environmental variation apparently has a depressing effect on some aspects of performance ? In other words , the environ-ment does not stimulate performance , but actually serves as a depressant ... A variation of building fatigue is perhaps seen during the breeding phase as well . Research is beginning to emerge , documenting the previously assumed situation where conception rate is often considerably lower in total confinement than in open lots . Is this an expression of confinement depression upon the hormonal system ? // Three different experiments were conducted by Wahlstrom and Libal ( 1980 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems ? enclosed building and open front building with outside feeding area ? on performance and carcass development . These authors showed that the enclosed building ( confinement ) rearing resulted in inferior performance . Provided that pigs are kept in draft-free quarters with a dry sleeping area , they can adapt to a wide range of temperatures when kept in open buildings . Wahlstrom and Libal were not able to identify what factor was linked to the decreased rate of gain and feed consumption of pigs confined in the enclosed building . High levels of ammonia , dust , and hydrogen sulfide , common in hog confinement buildings , were not considered significant because a continually operating pit fan was used to lower the content of these components below levels normally found in confinement housing . No health problems were found in animals in either environment.15 Socha and Cunningham ( 1974 ) have further confirmed that the average daily gain of pigs on dirt lots is greater than those penned in an enclosed building with slatted floors . Ventilation and humidity may be additional variables , together with stocking rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related issues , multiple measures are needed in comparing two or more different husbandry systems . Such problems as lameness , tail biting , or poor growth are more likely to be pluricausal and multifactorial rather than single cause and factor specific ( such as dirt versus concrete surface ) . Confinement and Infertility Confinement delays the onset of puberty , a serious factor in lowered fertility in breeder-sows . Rampacek and Kraeling ( University of Georgia ) reported that , in gilts raised in confinement , 35.7% exhibited estrus by 250 days , whereas nonconfined gilts had a 75.9% incidence of estrus ( Feedstuffs , January 29 , 1978 ) . The U.S.D.A. estimates that the incidence of anestrus is 30% in confined gilts . These researchers theorized that confinement could be either too stressful or actually not sufficiently stressful . Tethering gilts has been shown to delay sexual maturity and to make the detection of heat cycles difficult , and a number of tethered animals have exhibited infantile genital tracts at 10 ? 12 months of age . They also have heavier adrenal glands than normal , a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Christenson ( 1981 ) has shown that confinement rearing ( versus non-confinement rearing ) resulted in a 12% reduction in the average percentage of gilts showing regular estrus cycles from 5 ? 9 months of age , and that 71.3% were cyclic by 9 months compared to 85.2% of nonconfinement-raised gilts . // Season of sexual maturation and breed also influenced the onset of puberty and estrus activity , with confinement per se having the most significant negative influence . Tuinte ( 1971 ) has shown that leg defects and other diseases such as parturition and infertility problems responsible for culling can be 1.5 times as high in individual housing systems as in group housing for sows and gilts . If exposed to a boar , gilts raised in confinement are more likely to come into heat . Thompson and Savage ( 1978 ) , for example , reported that 19 of 58 gilts exposed to a boar for 30 days showed signs of estrus , while only 3 of 61 gilts came into heat when not exposed to a boar . Thus , for hog breeders , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or adjacent to boars . The presence of females will also have a positive effect on the boar 's libido.16 Pig International ( May/June 1976 ) summarized the research of Signoret and co-workers in France , who showed that when gilts were kept isolated from boars only 49% came in heat . The sound of a boar triggered heat in 71% and the smell of a boar in 81% . Together , these two stimuli had the desired effect on 90% of the gilts , and this was increased to 97% when the females were also allowed to see the boar . The figure finally came up to 100% when they were permitted contact with him . Social deprivation from the boar may not be the only factor in decreased fertility rates in confinement-raised sows . Thompson has shown that con finement per se is stressful for young sows , causing an increase in ad renocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) ( a stress response hormone ) that in turn causes fertility problems ( National Hog Farmer , October 1976 ) . Thompson believes that there should be more selection pressure for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasis on their growth rate . His studies of ACTH and cortisol levels and fertility showed that gilts susceptible to stress , particularly the stresses of confinement , prove to be late breeders while they remain under the stressful conditions . Hemsworth et al . ( 1981 ) have shown that the reproductive performance of sows is enhanced when the animals are treated with " tender loving care , " as reflected by their lack of fear toward strangers ( observers ) . Stockmen who spend little time with the animals , so that they are not well socialized to people , will have sows that are easily disturbed and even fearful of human proximity which , as these researchers have shown , adversely affects productivity ( 16.5 live piglets per sow per year versus 21 on farms where there was a good sow-farmer relationship ) . Lack of exercise , or more correctly , activity , may also contribute to obesity and infertility in breeding sows . Feedstuffs ( October 1977 ) published a news item on a research project by O. M. Hale that addressed the lack of // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bred gilts are either tethered by the necks or shoulders in individual stalls , free only to get up and down , or they are confined to a small pen where they get only limited exercise . Working on the theory that pregnant sows do not get enough exercise during gestation confinement , Hale subjected them to a " jogging " program . For 15 minutes each day the sows are placed on an exercise treadmill , especially constructed for 136-kg sows , equipped with a timer . Hale then followed these sows through the gestation period to monitor their performance . Boars The husbandry of stud boars is beginning to receive more attention in view of infertility and lameness problems that often develop under certain management practices . Hemsworth et al . ( 1978a ) showed that either lack of physical contact or lack of physical and visual contact with other pigs during early life impairs subsequent copulatory behavior . Thomas et al . ( 1979 ) , in their study on the effects of housing and rearing on age at puberty and libido in boars , found that boars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier and demonstrated greater sexual aggressiveness compared to contemporary-age boars kept in confinement in concrete and reared either singly or in groups . Age at puberty was not affected by the presence of females , but , interestingly , boars reared without females attained a higher libido score . It would appear that the more traditional methods of boar husbandry may be more conducive to overall performance and that housing young boars on concrete in confinement should be critically reevaluated . Floor Types Undoubtedly one of the most serious aspects of pig husbandry , from a humane as well as a production standpoint , is the floor of the confinement house . Some pig facilities have solid wooden floors , with a slatted area for farrowing and for weaned piglets . Wooden flooring , in the absence of bedding , is probably more comfortable , less slippery , and less chilling than either concrete or metal flooring . A plastic-coated expanded metal wire floor system is now in the research and development phase and may be a more humane and effective flooring for sows and piglets where wooden flooring is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce labor , facilitate cleanliness , and reduce parasite infestations . The urine and feces of the pigs pass through the slats into a drain or tank below . This may be pumped directly to treatment lagoons or aerated with mechanical paddles to break down the manure rapidly . Because of the fact that straw bedding would clog up this waste disposal system , together with the costs of purchase and spreading , very few piggeries provide bedding for starter and finishing hogs . // Sainsbury and Sainsbury ( 1979 ) emphasize that the larger the pig , the wider the slat that can be used without sacrificing cleaning efficiency because small pigs provide less traffic to work waste material through the slat spaces . They have used , with considerable success , 125-mm wide slats with a 25-mm gap between them , with a slight camber on the surface and pencil-smooth edges and bevelled sides . With such a slat , they find the pens keep very dry and the flooring appears to be extremely comfortable for the animals . Slatted floors come in a variety of designs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fattening pigs . Concrete slats are cold and often slippery , and cause splayed legs , lameness , and arthritis . Smaller piglets frequently get a leg caught , especially where the concrete is chipped ( thus enlarging the slat ) . Death ( from being crushed by the mother prior to weaning ) and severe lameness and fractures can result . Metal slats have been employed in the design of some pig facilities , but these too are not always conducive to optimal comfort and health . In one design , the slats were such that a sow could slice off a teat if she got up the wrong way after lying down over the slats this did apparently happen according to Dr. Stan Curtis ( personal communication ) . Other areas affected by poor floors are the elbows and hocks and the forward teats of the young gilts . Nipple necrosis may develop , and the tips of the necrotic teats may often drop off , leaving the gilts nonfunctional and hampering their usefulness as replacement sows . Penny et al . ( 1980 ) suggest the following preventive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baths , extra bedding , plastic spray , adhesive tape , and even bras for the gilts . A durable plastisol-covered expanded metal ( steel mesh ) floor surface has been developed and marketed as Tenderfoot ( Pig American , November/ December 1977 ) . This is an extremely promising innovation for nursing and weaned pigs ( and some laboratory animal species also ) . This flooring is claimed to greatly reduce the incidence of spraddled legs , sprains , sore feet , and knee abrasions . Given a good footing , the piglets massage their mothers ' udders better , resulting in better milking and less mastitis . Sows on pads show no broken or cracked feet , and no evidence of arthritis . It was also claimed that the " waffle " nature of the plastisol coating on Tenderfoot pads traps air and has an additional insulating effect , minimizing the mastitis problems caused by udders on cold floors . In a study of different floor systems , concrete slats , then concrete slabs without pads or bedding material gave poorer daily weight gains than rubberpadded slabs or earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et al . ( 1977 ) reported that pigs housed on slats require extra food or extra time to reach the same slaughter weight as pigs raised on straw . Shorter carcass length , lower lean/fat ratios , and a higher percentage of back fat was also reported in pigs raised on slatted concrete floors . More feed and lower growth rates were found in another study of hogs raised on narrow concrete slats ( Jones et al. , 1968 ) . Where partially slatted floors are used and some solid flooring allowed for the // animals , overcrowding may force some pigs to spend more time on slats , which will reduce feed efficiency ( Alsmeyer et al. , 1970 ) . Also , feed requirements per unit gain increase as the amount of slatted flooring is increased ( Fritschen et al. , 1971 ) . Otto et al . ( 1979 ) found that the performance of fattening pigs on 100% slatted floors was poorer than on partial slats , and Steiger et al . ( 1979 ) , in preference studies and performance tests , concluded that partial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be provided . Ludvigsen ( 1980 ) is also critical of 100% slatted floors , noting that : The introduction of totally slatted floors to minimize the labour required to maintain clean pigs and pens turned out to be detrimental to social hierarchy and the health of the pigs , because of uncontrolled aggressiveness leading to tail biting and other physical damage . As a result most of the totally slatted floors have been changed to various types of partially slatted floors . Studies support the importance of the position of the slatted area . It has been shown that slatted floors close to the feeding area stimulates aggressiveness but slatting in the dunging area only reduces aggressiveness and the incidence of tail biting and locomotor disturbances . Newton et al . ( 1980 ) studied the effects of four different types of floor slats on the performance of swine and on the growth and soundness of their feet . Slat materials were porcelainized steel , concrete , plastic surfaced , or aluminum . Several significant differences were found , notably that pigs housed on concrete developed the most hoof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of lesions than steel or aluminum . Hogs raised on earth also have fewer foot problems than those raised on concrete , steel , or aluminum floors , the latter causing the highest level of injuries ( Fritschen and Cunningham , 1973 ) . National Hog Farmer ( October 1976 ) published a major review emphasizing that badly designed and laid floors in confinement units caused foot injuries to 65% of the pigs sent to slaughter ( according to the Scottish Farm Buildings Investigation Unit ) . In another survey , R. H. C. Penny ( University of London Royal Veterinary College ) found that 100% of sows examined at slaughter had some degree of foot injury , 35% of suckling pigs were affected , 41% of the weaning-age pigs had foot injuries , and 66% of the finishers had foot lesions of some type . The various lesions and claw anomalies that developed in pigs kept on totally slatted concrete floors healed rapidly once the animals were transferred to a natural earth surface ( Fritschen and Cunningham , 1974 ) . Confined sows and boars , especially those kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can seriously interfere with performance . Smith and Mitchell ( 1976 , 1977 ) , Smith and Robertson ( 1971 ) , and Fritschen ( 1973b , 1976 ) have all shown that lameness is a serious welfare and economic problem in confinement-raised hogs kept on slatted floors . Prolonged immobility or a reduction in activity may well be a significant factor in lameness in pigs . Possibly , hogs on slats tend to move less because once they // attain a secure and comfortable position for their feet they are reluctant to give it up . In one study , boars provided with daily exercise on a treadmill were compared with others kept in confinement ( Perrin and Bowland , 1977 ) . At slaughter there were no differences in feed conversion ( i.e. , no " waste " associated with exercise ) . However , exercise had reduced the incidence of leg anomalies such as bow legs , flexion of the carpus , and sickle leg . Geyer ( 1978 ) offers further insights into the pigs ' susceptibility to lame ness . He has found that the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per 28 days ) than in sows ( 5 ? 6 mm per 28 days ) , and lack of wear can soon lead to deformities . The area of the bearing surface of the lateral claw is often greater than that of the medial claw in pigs housed on slats and concrete ; this finding is considered to correspond to the greater weight born by the lateral claw . In an environment with a soft surface ( e.g. , field , straw yard ) the medial claw develops to have a greater surface area . Animals with malproportioned lateral and medial claws should not be used for breeding , because splits are more liable in the lateral claw . The claw can also give an excellent indication of the quality of the floor . The spaces between slats are , ideally , related to the size of the claws , and the spaces are often too wide , resulting in a high incidence of damage to the coronary band . Geyer urges that all new types of flooring should be tested , preferably for a prolonged period , before becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that slat dimensions remain constant while the growing pigs ' feet change . Young pigs need narrower slats , since widely separated slats cause injuries , but on narrow slats at a later age they get too dirty and thus more prone to infection . Steiger et al . ( 1979 ) found that , given the choice , 30 ? 90-kg pigs preferred wide ( 100-mm ) wooden slats rather than narrow ( 50-mm ) wooden slats for standing , walking , and running . Observation of the pigs ' walking ability confirmed that they walked sub stantially better on the wide slats . Smith ( 1981 ) notes that in a review of fattening systems these observations are in close agreement with the recom mendations attributed to Geyer ( 1978 ) of maximum gap widths of 18 ? 22 mm for pigs at about 20 kg , 22 ? 26 mm at about 40 kg , and 24 ? 28 mm at around 100 kg live weight . Interestingly , Metz and Oosterlee ( 1980 ) found lower antibody levels and therefore greater disease susceptibility in pigs kept without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sows and pigs kept in pens with straw . Confinement of Sows : Tethering , Farrowing Crates , or Loose Pens ? " Because of " bullying " in the sow pens or yards ( which often occurs simply because the animals are bored or overcrowded ) , penning or tethering sows in // separate stalls is now gaining popularity ( see Figure 11 ) . These totally confined sows must be kept on restricted diets , or they become obese and suffer from lowered fertility as a result of lack of exercise . Prof. H. H. Sambraus and coworkers from the University of Munich studied the behavior of sows kept in different systems of husbandry . They showed that sows kept in separate stalls ( either penned in or chained down ) may seem superior to those kept in social groups if productivity is used as the sole criterion . However , close observations of behavior and functional cycles revealed that , in contrast to group-kept sows , " those kept in individual pens showed numerous behavioral disturbances in particular concerning feeding habits . It is thus concluded that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorial in Confinement ( July/August 1977 ) highlighted several aspects of the sow tethering question . It was noted that successful breeders have tried it and given it up . One commented : " Sows will go crazy , break bones . They 're hell to move from gestation to farrowing . " Two arguments often given in favor of the tether are savings in space and protection from the rest of the herd . Other points in favor of tethering are that sows are more accessible for any kind of treatment , and that they have more freedom than in a farrowing crate and more room to grow if they are kept after having had one or two litters ( some hog farmers only keep sows for the first or second litter ) . One would certainly have anticipated some research in the tethering of sows , but apparently progress still occurs through trial and error , often at the farmer 's expense and at the cost of animal suffering . The Australian Livestock and Grain Producers Association ( Brown , 1981 ) considers the phasing out of tethering sows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare resulting from producerfunded research . " Research into various husbandry systems have convinced Australian swine producers that stalls are preferable to tethering according to Brown 's welfare report . Sows are placed in farrowing crates to prevent piglets from being injured when the mother moves or lies down . However , not all farrowing crates are designed to maximize sow comfort . A circular crate , allowing the sow space to move , but protecting the piglets , may be superior to many commercial designs of narrow steel crates that are marketed today . Some farmers only keep their sows crated for the first few days after giving birth , whereas others keep their sows crated until the piglets are weaned , which may be at any time after 3 weeks of age . Backstrom ( 1973 ) and Peo ( 1960 ) have both shown that sows in farrowing crates have more problems than those kept in pens : dystocia , agalactia , higher litter death rates , and wasting disease the thin sow syndrome ( Ludvigsen , 1980 ) . Some successful pig farmers deplore the farrowing crate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on long tethers or free to move in a much larger farrowing pen . A sow that does have freedom of movement is // surely less likely to injure its offspring . One hog farmer ( personal communication ) found that " more piglets were crushed with the crate system than in an open floor farrowing pen , " so at considerable cost he returned to the latter system . Hojgard-Olsen and Nielsen ( cited in Baldwin and Vestergaard , 1981 ) found that the provision of straw for loose-housed sows increased the number of live-born piglets , the weight gain of the piglets , and the milk production of the sows . A recent report in Pig American ( September/October 1978 ) reviews the // research of the Swedish Livestock Institute demonstrating that pregnant sows placed in large pens with straw bedding are considerably more productive than sows placed in the usual farrowing stalls or crates that have no bedding . Nest-making behavior18 is not frustrated and , in these free farrowing pens , the sows have lower incidences of inflamed udders ( agalactia ) . Also , fewer needed hormone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confinement conditions ( see Table 4 ) . There was a reduction in the number of piglets suffering from chilling or suffocation in fetal membranes at birth and there were also fewer cases of inflamed joints in the legs of piglets born in free-movement pens . Significantly , the article states that : And finally , a positive benefit advanced for the idea of less restriction up to point of farrowing was that it meant less stress for the sow to endure . Farrowing is a difficult time for her , but being able to move around , rummage , and nestle in the bedding of her pen seemed to offset the tension so that she was quieter , apparently more relaxed , when farrowing started . Although this system is labor intensive , the advantages of providing bedding and freedom of movement are obvious , productivity complementing the humane concerns of good animal husbandry . Unfortunately , in many farming regions straw is in short supply and too costly for use as bedding on a regular basis . Ekesbo ( 1980 ) has reviewed the performances of several thousand sows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in confinement stalls . His findings have led to 85% of all sows in Sweden being housed in straw pens . He found that confined sows had twice the disease incidence , longer labor and greater incidence of dystocia , a greater incidence of stillborn and mummified piglets , and a higher incidence of traumatic injuries to the sows ( 6.1% in stalls versus 0.8% in pens ) .19 For optimal health and welfare , swine need separate feeding , dunging , and lying areas , i.e. , a free-choice environment to satisfy their basic biological needs . Swine that are tethered or otherwise confined can not satisfy these basic needs and , according the Ekesbo and several studies cited in his review , their health and welfare will suffer as a consequence . Piglet mortalities were consistently lower : when their dams are free in the pens with 18Prostaglandin hormone , routinely injected into sows to induce labor , causes an intense increase in motivation to build a nest ; if sows are restricted in a narrow farrowing crate , such treatment raises a significant welfare question . The provision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nest-making actions ( which will be executed in the absence of straw ) , is desirable in sows so treated ( Blackshaw , 1983 ) . 19From further extensive studies in Scandinavia , Gravis ( 1982 ) concludes : 1 . Although housing systems for free sows are more expensive than for locked sows , increased productivity of the free sows will probably compensate for increased costs . 2 . Free sows expressed a more " natural " behavior than did the locked ones . The behavior of free sows was more effective for environmental adaptation . 3 . On the basis of conclusions I and 2 and general opinion , we may therefore for Scandinavian countries recommend loose housing systems for lactating and dry sows . ( See also Gustafsson , 1982. ) // the piglets ; when pen space is increased ; when straw bedding is provided ; and when solid rather than slatted or partly slatted floors are used . Simensen ( cited in Baldwin and Vestergaard , 1981 ) found increased piglet mortality as space allowance and width of the farrowing pen decreased . Svendsen et al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose versus confined sows through gestation , as well as shorter farrowing time and fewer piglet mortalities . Hurtgen and Leman ( 1980 ) found in their survey that sows confined to gestation crates after breeding had a 13.8% higher farrowing rate than sows kept in groups , while there was no difference in fertility rates for gilts bred in confinement or outdoors ( 65.5% ) . Otto et al . ( 1979 ) found differences in sow husbandry to have no effect on piglet mortalities or growth rates up to weaning . Simensen and Karlberg ( 1980 ) reported that preweaning mortalities of piglets averaged 22.2% and that good management was the most significant factor ( above and beyond the husbandry system employed ) in reducing losses . Attendance at farrowing resulted in a 2.8% increase in survival . Generally , the larger the litters , the greater was the mortality , and mortalities increased after sows had their fifth litter . A 3.1% lower mortality was found where family members , rather than hired hands , cared for the animals , and provision of straw bedding resulted in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence of dry sows in the same building as farrowing sows . Contrary to earlier studies , there was no evidence of increasing losses with increasing herd size . Lower piglet mortalities ( by 2.8% ) were found on farms only breeding for sale to finishers , while higher mortalities were found with integrated production operations , especially when fatteners were in the same building as farrowing sows . Simensen 's earlier observation that small farrowing pens ( less than 5 m2 ) were associated with lower piglet survival was not confirmed in this study . Tail Biting , Cannibalism , and Other Behavior Problems Pigs may develop a number of behavior problems , especially when kept in confinement under overcrowded , humid , and poorly ventilated conditions or in separate stalls . These are indicative of stress and engender both humane and economic concern since their performance will be adversely affected . Boredom may lead to excessive oral behavior , including bar chewing , ear chewing , and navel sucking . Crowding and other environmental stresses may increase fighting , tail biting , and cannibalism . Ewbank and Meese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbreaks of aggression in confined hogs : the pig may not possess a ready means of inhibiting intraspecific aggression ( such as rolling over onto one side as does a dog or wolf ) . Instead , it simply depends on the ability to flee from the aggressor . Thus , restriction of escape distance brought about by increased population density could perhaps he a contributing factor in // sudden outbreaks of violence in intensive confinement-type swine operations . Overcrowding and lack of opportunity for defensive escape would thus be both inhumane and contrary to the interests of good husbandry . Also , aggressive activities may increase by as much as 175% in frequency in pigs in small pens ( Ross and Curtis , 1976 ) . Any component of the pig 's environment that may make it uncomfortable may be expressed as tail biting or other antisocial vices . It is probable that tail biting in many cases arises as a response to close confinement , lack of possibility to escape ( when bitten ) , and a need for play and manipulation in an impoverished environment . The tails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nibbled ; as stress continues the nibbling turns to biting . For these reasons , pigs have their tails docked ; nevertheless they may still find an outlet in biting each other 's ears or shoulders . As Fritschen ( Confinement , September 1976 ) states : Docking the tail at birth or within 1 week after birth is successful in preventing tail biting . However , the environmental conditions that provoke tail biting may still be present even though the pig is tailless . When the tail has been docked , the pig may express its discomfort in more subtle ? but economically significant ? ways , such as reduction of gain , increase in feed required per unit of gain , or even ulcers . . . . Until the behavioral characteristics of confinement-reared pigs are studied more thoroughly , we must depend on known management factors for prevention or cure . Penny and Mullen ( 1976 ) have also found some evidence that docking to prevent tail biting in pigs increases the frequency of ear biting . Thus docking the tail merely removes one symptom of stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that external parasites , causing a greasy exudation behind the ears or under the flank , may attract other pigs to such areas and lead to cannibalism . Anemia may cause increased tail biting , and lack of bedding on cold concrete floors has also been implicated . Also , adequate amounts of protein in the ration has been found to reduce cannibalism among confined swine . In a study conducted at Purdue University ( Vet Med/Small Animal Clinician , February 1977 ) , severe ear biting occurred among hogs fed a ration containing 12% protein . Severity of cannibalism was increased by crowding . However , no undesirable behavior was seen when the hogs were fed a ration containing 15% corn-soy protein , even when they were crowded into a space of 0.43 m2 per animal , although crowding did reduce the rate of grain and feed conversion . Interestingly , Kelly et al . ( 1980 ) found that when pigs from different groups are mixed ( for finishing ) , pigs fasted 24 hours beforehand engaged in more biting activity than pigs fed at libitum . The provision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter . The use of olfactory masking agents , such as vanilla extract or perfume sprayed behind the ears and into the snouts of such animals would have been a useful addition to this study , since some hog // raisers believe such treatment is effective in reducing aggressive behavior in freshly mixed groups of pigs . McGlone and Curtis ( 1981 ) have found that aggression in pigs can be reduced simply by the provision of small compartments in the pen into which pigs can hide their heads . Most , if not all behavior problems are symptoms of stress related to one or more adverse husbandry practices . This being the case , one should question the wisdom of eliminating the symptoms , as by amputating tails or feeding the animals tranquilizers or other psychoactive drugs such as lithium ( Dantzer and Mormede , 1979 ) . Preventive management to enhance the comfort of the animals and to reduce behavioral anomalies and secondary stress-related diseases should , according to Fritschen , address the following basic variables : Floor space ( on partially or totally slatted floors ) 0.3 m2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 27 ? 45 kg ; 0.7 m2 at 68 kg to finishing weight and 1.3 ? 1.5 m2 for sows . Feeder and waterer space ? competition over feeder and waterer space can cause serious problems . One feeder hole per 4 pigs ( rectangular feeder ) or one hole per 5 pigs ( for circular feeder ) are recommended . Allow one cup-type waterer for 25 ? 30 pigs and one nipple-type waterer for 15 ? 20 pigs . Climate control ? No specifications for temperature , humidity , or ventilation are available , but these are critical , as are extreme changes in ambient temperature and humidity , in the genesis of behavior-stress problems . Miscellaneous Other Problems Semiconfinement Systems Although a number of pigs may be kept in semiconfinement systems ( i.e. , climatic rather than environmentally controlled ) where the pigs are under a half-roof with half of the pen outdoors , problems comparable to those encountered in complete confinement are seen . The tendency to overstock , crowding stress , heat problems in the summer ( in spite of sprinkler-water coolers ) , and serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semi-confinement systems neither trouble-free nor wholly conducive to the animals ' welfare . Modified open front buildings are perhaps closer to the ideal . Bedding , to provide some warmth in the winter , is rarely provided . At least the animals tend to suffer less from respiratory diseases in climatic and modified open front houses , compared to those in poorly ventilated total confinement buildings , and are not exposed to the same risks of a mechanical or power failure in the ventilation system . A propos of providing a bedded area , Madsen and co-workers ( cited in Baldwin and Vestergaard , 1981 ) reported that straw bedding given to growing pigs reduces the rate of incidence of all common causes of swine mortality , with the exception of respiratory diseases . // Hypostimulation Lack of stress ( i.e. , hypostimulation ) itself may be a negative factor in confinement rearing of hogs , as has been found by Gross ( see Chapter 1 ) to be a significant factor in increasing the susceptibility of poultry to certain diseases . Optimal social stimulation may provide a sufficient degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of behavioral stress factors in the development of arteriosclerosis in swine , according to Ratcliffe and co-workers ( 1969 ) . Socially isolated swine become withdrawn and develop arteriosclerotic lesions , a factor to consider in certain hog systems where boars and breeding sows are kept in separate stalls , especially when they do not even have visual contact but instead face a feed trough and a wall . Providing the animals with some visual contact with each other may greatly reduce these social-deprivation stresses . Hypostimulation may also underlie lowered fertility in confined sows . The minor yet potentiating stress of changing environment and group housing resulted in 10% fewer reproductive failures than in unstressed breeding sows ( Fahmy and Dufour , 1976 ) . Riley ( 1981 ) has shown that subnormal psychosocial stress ( as by caging mice singly ) dramatically increases the growth of lymphosarcoma . This is believed to be due to the immunosuppressive effects of " hypostress . " Riley showed that " eustress " of housing mice in groups had a protective effect , thus raising an important question relevant to the monotonous low-stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monotony and understimulation of single-penned sows , boars , and veal calves is not only a humane concern ; it should also concern the stockman economically , in terms of disease , infertility , and other problems . Pen Design and Layout In stable groups of fattening pigs that are not stressed from overstocking and are not disturbed by other factors , the animals will use one area of their pen as a latrine . Another area will be kept clean as the lying and sleeping place . If pigpens are not conducive to such behavioral needs ( such as those with all slat floors or with no clear , comfortable and , if possible , raised lying area ) , then the pigs will lie and defecate and urinate anywhere . They will be dirty and more susceptible to disease . These problems are aggravated further when the pens are overstocked and when the amount of living space per pig decreases as they grow . Proper design of pens , to satisfy the most basic needs of these intelligent and hygienic animals , is essential for good husbandry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even on university research farms . Fritschen and co-authors ( 1974 ) reported details of their studies on the type of building and percentage of slatted floor on health and performance of fattening pigs . It was concluded that , because of winter freezing , slatted floors should be under a roof and that , for best performance , no more than half of the floor in each stall should be slatted . Pens in the modified open front buildings , which was the best system compared to total confinement , environmentally // regulated ( ER ) , and open front buildings , seldom required scraping ; the ER system required the most cleaning out . Fritschen ( Confinement , November/December 1976 ) reported that pigs will keep their sleeping area clean provided the feeder and waterer and slatted dunging area are properly laid out . Apparently hogs will keep the feeding area clean if it is near or in the sleeping area . Placing the waterer near or over the slatted area may help set a pattern in the group to use the slatted portion of the pen , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop when the feeder is located too near to the waterer and slats , 20 or when the sleeping and feeding areas are separated by a section of slats . Also , in many confinement houses , dry sows and gilts are kept on slats with iron stalls to move into for feeding ( the free rather than tethered stall system ) . Few will lie in their dung and urine on the open slatted area behind these stalls . Such houses again reflect how little consideration has been given to the behavioral needs of the animals . To quote Fritschen : " This is an example of the manager being more concerned about his convenience than the likes , dislikes , or well-being of the pig . " Humidity A high humidity is often maintained in some hog units , and the environment is not unlike a sauna bath . High ammonia levels associated with this atmosphere may be stressful to hogs and humans alike , and may create respiratory problems ( especially when the lungs are being stressed by migrating ascarid worm larvae ) . It is remarkable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an atmosphere that could be cut with a knife . Possibly the aerosol spread of certain pathogens is reduced by the precipitation effect of high humidity on droplet nuclei . However , swine " sauna " houses may be bor derline pathogenic environments . For example , Dent and co-workers ( 1976 ) exposed 12 21-day-old Yorkshire pigs to 40% , 60% , and 80% relative humidity ( RH ) in seriatum with a daily temperature cycle of 21 ? 37 ? C over a 6-week period . They found that stressed animals had a significantly lower per formance , which was improved by various drug treatments . Plasma cortisol levels were markedly depressed for the first 12 ? 24 hr of each stress period , after which time the cortisol level returned to near normal levels . Humidity stress also resulted in a 25 ? 30% decrease in serum thyroxine levels , an increase in blood glucose levels , and depressed insulin levels . ( These latter findings are a typical reaction to high cortisol levels , and suggest that growth impairment during stress was due to an inavailability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1981 ) report that optimally controlled tempera ture and humidity resulted in faster gains , improved health , elevated serum gamma globulins , lowered pulse and respiration , and quieter suckling piglets than those exposed to suboptimal conditions . Older pigs exposed to relatively // high CO2 levels ( around 0.20% , which the authors have recorded in swine confinement buildings ) showed a marked increase in pulse and respiratory rates . Air cooling in the summer resulted in an increase in gamma globulins and phagocytic leukocyte activity , and increased daily gain and food conversion efficency . Similar changes were reported during winter when the air temperature , humidity , and ventilation exchange rate ( to control CO2 buildup ) were optimal ( optimal temperature was 21.3 ? C ? 0.4 ? ; optimal humidity was 66.1% ? 0.82% ) . Lighting The pig 's retina contains a large number of cones and is almost as sensitive to the full color spectrum as that of man ( Klopfer , cited in Dow , 1980 ) . However , the amount of illumination that pigs require in confinement has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involve greater exposure to artificial lighting , as in the " photoacceleration " of poultry . Pig International ( May/June 1976 ) reported that D. V. Klotchkow in the U.S.S.R. has exposed gilts to 17 hr of daylight per day and found that they have a longer estrus , a greater conception rate , and an increased litter size . The additional light was given from 10 ? 20 days before mating until the 40th day of pregnancy , and came in the form of 100 ? 200 watt incandescent bulbs suspended above the pigs . Often pigs are kept in semidarkness with the idea of reducing aggression . Yurkov ( cited in Vestergaard and Bareham , 1981 ) has found that low illumination levels in confinement-raised pigs reduced their immunological response to disease . Many pigs are housed in complete darkness , yet if given the , opportunity , they will " work " and press a bar in order to obtain light ( Baldwin and Meese , 1977 ) . Pigs kept in darkness , according to Van Putten ( 1969 ) , live in a state of high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , and will sit for long periods on their haunches in what he calls a depressed , " mourning attitude . " Sainsbury ( 1974 ) addresses this important practical and ethical question of raising livestock in darkness , noting that in all farm livestock fattening is assisted by keeping the animals in dim light , because this age old practice makes them calmer , quieter , and less aggressive . However , Sainsbury states that : the clean habits of pigs are promoted by lighting the dunging area to a brighter intensity than the sleeping area and it may be said of the stockman that he is more likely to keep the house hygienic if the lighting is good . It is for this latter reason especially that one decries the use of the windowless house for what sometimes seems to be no more than a popular fad . The correct procedure is to have as much light as can safely be used for the benefit of the stock and if this can be natural light , then it is clearly the sensible thing to do . Also uniformity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread out evenly over the pens and , together with temperature , humidity , and air // movement , can have a significant influence on the health of the livestock . Techniques are available to enable the animal welfare scientist to obtain objective and verifiable data , so the animals ' preferences can and should be measured . Waste Disposal Systems/Poisonous Gases Prof. M. J. Twiehaus ( 1974 ) expresses his concern over total confinement factory farming of pigs with the following frank statement : Man has built a hog house primarily for his own convenience , and in my opinion , has done a poor job ? stuffed the pig in the house with little or no concern as to the ideal environment for the four-legged animal . Do we know why some swine vomit in confinement that are over pits , could these be just greedy pigs ? I doubt it . We do know that some of the gases from decomposition of swine waste may cause nausea at certain levels . Ekesbo ( 1976 , 1977 ) has reported deaths in pigs and cattle that are associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emanating from liquid manure pits under the slatted floors of their enclosures . Improved ventilation in confinement houses may not always be adequate , and there is always the attendant concern of human health . Solid floors , " dry " manure removal , and the provision of some bedding eliminate these and other problems associated with the slatted floor system with liquid manure tanks beneath . Flush cleaning and ventilation under the slatted floors are also improvements over the manure-tank design . One of the most costly aspects of intensive pig farming is the question of waste disposal . Experiments are being done in the U.S. on the possibilities of recycling waste material : filtering the " water " from liquid manure tanks and supplying it back to hogs as their sole source of drinking water , and feeding the washed fecal remains ( which contain considerable quantities of undigested nutrients ) back to the pigs . However , the concept of recycling eliminated fecal and urine waste material , in spite of the logical economic benefits , overlooks the physiological fact that a variety of toxins and metabolic end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are antibiotics and other feed additives . The hazards of feeding meal containing feces contaminated with parasites ( especially roundworm eggs ) , bacterial pathogens , drugs , and other chemicals remain to be overcome . Also , such systems require great quantities of water ; purified water from a second treatment lagoon may be piped back to the animals , but , with inadequate water treatment , exposure to noxious agents present in the dissolved fecal material will occur . Thus , feeding these materials back to animals may be cutting corners too close . Esthetics aside , economic savings may be significant since increasingly liquid manure is not used on the land and is wasted in oxidizing ( aerobic ) lagoons . In Missouri , only an estimated 25% of farmers reuse the slurry directly on their pastures . This figure may decrease even more if fewer and fewer // farmers raise their own crops to feed their pigs and instead trade in their independence for the convenience of the food integrator . Good manure from farm animals should go back onto the land , not directly back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land of this essential resource ( which is not a " by-product " but an integral part of the whole system of farming that is being broken ) , have not been computed . Like many aspects of " factory farming , " the recycling of waste material may be an economical measure that in the long run may cause more problems and need more bureaucratic regulatory supervision than it is actually worth . HEALTH AND PREVENTIVE HUSBANDRY Unshelm ( 1982 ) has shown that , in the Federal Republic of Germany , the incidence of several swine diseases causing mortality has increased with increasing confinement ( from 2.85% in 1960 ? 1962 to 6.13% in 1977 ? 1979 ) . Lindquist ( 1974 ) , in an extensive study of different systems of hog production , found that the system of rearing has the greatest influence on animal health . He concludes that 250 ? 300 pigs per building is optimal , higher densities having greater incidence of diseases such as pleurisy and pericarditis . Also , better health was correlated with : trough rather than on-the-floor feeding ; free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-in , all-out ) ; a spatial volume of at least 3 m3 per pig ; a total area of at least 0.7 m2 per pig ( lying area and area in dunging passage ) ; and a solid manure handling system . Lindquist 's study clearly indicates that the slatted concrete floor/liquid manure system so popular in the U.S. is definitely an inferior system , conducive to several diseases ( especially pneumonia ) and to poor performance . A serious aspect of intensive confinement farming is the gradual buildup of infections.21 With a continuous farrowing operation , for example , the indoor environment may build up a heavy contamination of pathogenic bacteria such as certain strains of E. coli , viruses , transmissible gastroenteritis , atrophic rhinitis , and internal and external parasites . In a study by Rhodes et al . ( 1979 ) , operators were asked to indicate their two worst farrowing house problems . E. coil diarrhea was identified as the most prevalent , with baby pig starvation and sow **27;434;TOOLONG syndrome as the next in importance . For these reasons , rigorous health precautions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential . Although it is generally believed that isolating animals may help reduce the incidence of infectious diseases . Hogg ( Feedstuffs , March 12 , 1979 ) has shown that social isolation may increase disease problems . Specifically , if gilts // are not allowed to comingle with older sows , they do not become infected with parvovirus . The parvovirus does not cause any overt illness , but the " vaccination " via the older carrier sows develops an immunity in the gilts that prevents the virus from reaching the fetuses when they later become pregnant . Gilts not acquiring such immunity are more likely to have stillbirths and smaller litters , since the parvovirus seriously affects the fetus but not the mother . These findings are extremely important to our conceptualizations of the ecology/ epidemiology of diseases . Under natural conditions , older animals may constitute an essential source of active immunity for younger animals in the flock or herd . Separating age groups may therefore disrupt this natural system of immunization and could increase susceptibility to various pathogens as well as making normally nonpathogenic organisms potentially more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reducing stress and disease in swine and other livestock . Sainsbury ( 1974 ) observes that many of the disease and behavior problems in intensively housed stock arise from the mixing of animals taken from different families and varying backgrounds . Because of this , there is a great interest in rearing stock from birth to death in the same pen and house and wherever possible keeping animals in their original family groups . This helps to prevent behavioral problems , reduce disease problems , and eliminate much labor and other expenses involved in moving the animals and disinfecting the pens . It also eliminates the need to put antibiotics in the feed as a preventive measure when the hogs arrive for finishing . Drugs in Feed The continuing use of antibiotic feed additives , particularly in the U.S. , is a costly and counterproductive husbandry practice for the following , often overlooked , reason . Newly arrived stock such as hogs or steers coming to the farm for finishing or fresh breeding stock are usually put on low levels of antibiotics as soon as they arrive . Such " protective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be infected may have their symptoms suppressed . The presence of disease is masked , not eliminated , by treating the animals with subtherapeutic doses of antibiotics in the feed . Worse , some animals may become carriers and infect others later , or succumb to disease themselves if they are stressed . A better practice may be to allow diseases to show themselves so that they may be recognized earlier and appropriately treated . The 1979 Nebraska Swine Report ( summarized in Feedstuffs , February 12 , 1979 ) demonstrated that antibiotic feed additives used during the finishing phase only slightly improved performance . The finishing pig 's ability to go without antibiotics was demonstrated when additives were withdrawn without any detrimental consequences . Well designed and managed hog confinement units for breeding and finishing are in operation in the U.S. , in which no // antibiotics are ever given in the feed . With good husbandry practices ( including showers and changing rooms to prevent spread of infection between buildings ) the multiple vaccination programs needed to keep confinement hogs " healthy " can be abandoned . Sainsbury ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of livestock production from a welfare viewpoint : Modern systems of housing and husbandry must at all costs endeavour to provide a naturally obtainable healthy environment but very many fall far short of this . It should be of concern that poultry have to be reared or maintained with a constant background of drugs , antibiotics and vaccines . I am not antagonistic in any way to the proper and controlled use of the excellent prophylactic and therapeutic measures that modern science has given us and the fine research that has enabled us to control disease on even huge livestock units is remarkable . It is exciting to see the enormous efforts made by the scientists to produce better vaccines and improved antibiotics and drugs but it would be even more encouraging if we could see specific investigation being made into husbandry systems that may eliminate so much dependence on coping with disease by artificial means . The next great challenge to the veterinarian and animal scientist is to develop those husbandry systems that do not necessitate or create a dependence upon drugs and vaccines . Although the appropriate use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and habitual use is to be deplored . We have long been guilty of such misapplication of science and technology , treating symptoms rather than underlying causes . This often creates more problems in the process , which necessitate more symptom-oriented intervention : a treadmill that gets nowhere . The answer is in the application of appropriate ( rather than traditional ) technology , in spite of arguments to the contrary by pharmaceutical companies and believers in the drug cult of modem farming . The solution is for farmers to live with " pests " and bacteria and not to drug their fields and animals " clean , " which can create ecological and health problems . Insect and bacterial populations should be carefully monitored and treatment only given when they are out of control and the reasons for the imbalance can not be rectified by a change in husbandry practices . FEED SYSTEMS Types of Food and Feeding Until all feeder pigs are finished on the same farm in which they were born , the hog industry will continue to lose millions of dollars annually . There are many stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeder-finishing farm ( often with an added stopover at an auction yard ) . Even the form of the food is involved since Tribble ( Feedstuffc , February 26 , 1979 ) reports that pigs fed a pelletized form of sorghum-soy bean diet suffered less // weight loss during shipping than pigs fed the same diet in a meal form rather than pelletized . The reasons for differences in weight loss and shrinkage between those fed meal or pellets is not known . Roughage ( fiber ) in the diet may be a significant factor . Most pigs are rarely given feed in a pelletized form because of costs . A dry sandy meal is used , resulting in considerable spillage from the food troughs or dispensers . Several studies have documented that esophagogastric ulcers can be aggravated by feeding fine-ground meal , by confinement , by overcrowding , and by selecting for an overly heavy , meat-type pig . ( Reiman et al. , 1968 ; Handlen et al. , 1969 ; Pickett et al. , 1969 ; Buerruecos and Robinson , 1970 ; Maxwell et al. , 1970 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet the losses in productivity due to ulcers are generally regarded as less costly than the savings derived from feeding nonpellitized ulcerogenic feed . Baird ( Feedstuffs , December 17 , 1977 ) makes some pertinent comments on this subject . He observed that pelleting of swine feeds has been found to produce about 20 kg more pork per ton . At a cost of $3 per ton for pelleting , the practice appears worthwhile at current market prices . It is hoped that a shift toward pelletized feed will follow from these findings , and reduce the problem of gastric ulceration and inappetence associated with feeding dry meal " sand . " A new development , more common in Europe , is to feed growing pigs an all-liquid diet . This has caused serious problems on some farms , such as pigs dying from salt poisoning . In hot weather or when a pig has mild enteritis or a fever , more water must be drunk , but on the all-liquid diet , the animal is denied this . Together with inappetence , an ailing pig on an all-liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Borland , 1977 ) . Although sows are carefully fed their rations individually under varying degrees of automation , fattening pigs are usually fed ad-lib ( i.e. , food is constantly available ) . They are also provided with ad-lib water , usually by a lick-activated nozzle hose . Fritschen and Moser ( 1979 ) report that newly arrived feeder pigs have a lower and delayed incidence of diarrhea as the fiber content ( oat level ) of the diet is increased . Also , limited feeding on the floor was found preferable to ad-lib feeding from the self-feeder during the first few days after arrival at the feeder-finishing farm . Van Putten ( 1980 ) is a proponent of environmental enrichment for finishing-fattening pigs , noting that a handful of straw per pig per day will give an average of 1 ? 5 hr of occupation daily , with a quantitative ( threefold ) reduction in types of behavior interpreted as indicative of conflict and reduced well-being , although growth and feed conversion were not affected . The influence of group size on the productivity of growing finishing pigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad-lib or restrictively ( i.e. , at set intervals rather than having free access ) . No significant differences in performance were found in pigs kept in groups of 8 , 16 , or 32 provided they were // fed ad-lib . If fed restrictively , size of group had a significant effect on performance , groups of 8 pigs gaining weight faster and more efficiently and having a better carcass quality than those from groups of 16 or 32 per pen ( Petersen and Nielsen , 1977 ) . Jonsson ( cited in Craig , 1981 ) found that castrated male pigs gained more weight if housed in groups than if penned singly ( because of sound facilitation of eating ) , but if gilts were housed with them , the gilts had a poorer weight gain ( because of competition at the feeder ) . Interestingly , gilts gained faster than barrows ( castrates ) when housed individually . However , rapid growth may be a contributing factor in joint lesions in fattening pigs . Perrin et al . ( 1978 ) found evidence of articular cartilage lesions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and proximal femur . No correlation was found between breed or floor type on the incidence or severity of cartilage lesions . However , a correlation was found with increas ing weight , especially between 60 and 120 kg live weight . Lack of exercise may also be a contributing factor . Observations by Reiland ( 1975 ) support the notion that accelerated growth may cripple farm animals.22 His research shows that the main cause of the symptoms of leg weakness in pigs is a generalized skeletal disease termed osteochondrosis . The incidence of this disease is strongly correlated with rapid growth and is affected by genetics and nutrition . Reiland believes that this condition is not unique to pigs . It exists today in all intensively fed , rapidly growing farm livestock . Genetic selection for rapid growth and a high protein and energy diet , coupled with possible mineral and other deficiencies in formulated rations and suboptimal flooring in confinement houses , most likely contribute to this distressing and widespread disorder . Lameness in pigs involving the feet may also be correlated with a dietary insufficiency of biotin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigs . " Skip " Feeding Although it is common practice to " skip feed " sows ( i.e. , feed on alternate days ) or to reduce the sow 's daily ration in order to prevent obesity , the concept of feeding them only twice a week is questionable from both ethological and humane considerations . In a report by Mahan and Murray of the Ohio Ag ricultural Research and Development Center ( Pig American , January/February 1978 ) , pregnant sows were kept in groups ( i.e. , not tethered or kept in single pens ) and were fed twice a week , having access to food for either 24 hours or 8 hours . The authors found that twice-a-week gorging resulted in good gestation
