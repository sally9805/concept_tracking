THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment IN the first days of the new year , the world appeared to veer abruptly off into an unfortunately perilous direction , as though it had decided to regard the advent of the year 1980 as marking the beginning of a new era . In Afghanistan , Soviet forces , having overseen the execution not only of the country 's President , Hafizullah Amin , but of several of his relatives , were said to be approaching the border of Pakistan , and there were fears that the Soviets might launch incursions into that country . To the already highly combustible and unpredictable mixture of Middle Eastern oil and Islamic revolution was now added the danger of a confrontation between the superpowers . However , it was difficult for anyone to say for certain just where the Soviet troops were or what they were doing , because foreign newsmen were being expelled from Afghanistan . Some observers were calling Afghanistan an inverted Vietnam , in which the Soviet Union was trying to prop up a puppet government while the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obvious : whereas the Vietnam War was shown on television to the whole world every evening , the Soviets had so far kept their war in Afghanistan in complete darkness . Not even their own people had been informed that Soviet troops were now at war . The resulting un certainty , by increasing the chances for miscalculation by other powers , itself contributed to the peril of the crisis . Meanwhile , the Soviets were filling the vacuum of information with deceptions , many of them of the most startling kind . For example , they were depicting President Amin as the political creature of the United States , when in fact he had been the Soviets ' own loyal ally , and had been described as such in the Soviet press just a few weeks before his overthrow and execution . This invention and others like it were probably believed by almost no informed person on earth , yet they nevertheless had a peculiar effectiveness as a sort of aggression against the peace of mind of anyone who was trying in good faith to find his bearings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to look as though the Islamic revolutionaries there had seized hostages from the wrong superpower . While they were shaking their fists at the United States and shouting " Death to Carter ! " the Soviet Union was approaching on the horizon behind them . The ever more chaotic and fragmented Iranian government  --  a disharmonious , uncoordinated aggregation of Islamic clergymen , Western-trained bureaucrats , and street mobs of various persuasions  --  condemned the invasion ( or , at least , the Foreign Minister did ) , but the Communist Tudeh Party , which officially supports the government , vaguely welcomed it , and thereby deepened the fear that the Soviets might one day try to intervene in Iranian affairs . As the confusing , bloody drama unfolded , other peoples  --  Kurds , Baluchis , Azerbaijanis  --  were brought into view under the restless spotlight of world press coverage . Most Americans knew little or nothing about them , yet it was turning out that our fortunes were indissolubly tied to theirs . Here in the United States , President Carter recalled our Ambassador to Moscow for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty , and a series of unfavorable comments on the President 's policies were heard from rivals for his office . In any case , ap proval of SALT by the Senate seemed impossible for the time being . Its defenders had consistently argued that the treaty , far from being a concession made by the United States to the Soviet Union , was actually in our country 's best interests , even when these were defined in the narrowest military terms . They had pointed out that under the treaty the Soviets would he restricted to placing ten warheads on each of their three hundred and eight heavy missiles , for a total of three thousand and eighty warheads , whereas without the treaty the Soviets would he able to place perhaps as many as thirty warheads on those same missiles , for a total of nine thousand two hundred and forty warheads . Now that approval of the treaty had receded into the indefinite future , the margin of six thousand one hundred and sixty warheads and the corresponding number that we would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took on frightening concreteness . At least for the present , the only forum that the United States and the Soviet Union had ever set up for dealing with these and other nuclear matters was closed . In the Soviet Union , one private voice  --  that of Andrei Sakharov , the dissident Soviet physicist  --  sounded with special clarity and courage , " The situation is so tragic , dramatic , and dangerous that we must all concentrate on how to prevent a chain reaction that , in this nuclear age , could have unpredictable consequences for mankind , " he said . He went on to say , " The Soviet leaders must have known how provocative their action would seem to the United States and other countries . They must have calculated that the damage to their foreign relationships would he temporary but the gain in power terms would be permanent .... What is essential now is for the United Nations to convene and put pressure on tht .

Alternatives THE other day , we bicycled across the Charles River from Boston to visit a retail store called the Cambridge Alternative Power Company . The store , a remodelled old filling station nestling under a new forty-three-font windmill , sells just what its name says it does : wood stoves , kerosene lamps , solar equipment , and a lot of energy-saving stuff we had n't even known existed . The place has been open for business just over a year , and its business is booming . So we were told , seriatim , by two of its three owners : its president , Nelson B. Robinson , who is a bookstore proprietor and also a prime mover in New England Sierra Club circles ; and its vice-president , Bertram B. Johansson , who is a retired Christian Science Monitor journalist , and who built a house twenty-five years ago that is , in today 's environmental terminology , " passive solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other member of the triumvirate is Chairman of the Board Dr. Alfred Kraft , a no-nukes dentist , who plans to heat a new apartment of his with wood . ) When we asked the president and the vice-president for some details of how things were going , both beamed warmly . " A year ago , we had only one and three-quarters people working for us , and now we have eight , " said Mr. Robinson , who is forty years old , has thinning brown hair , and wears horn-rimmed glasses . " Ten , " said Mr. Johansson , a burly man in his sixties with a white mustache . " We figured our sales might be big from September through December , when people usually start worrying about winter weather , but since the Iranian crisis and the Three Mile Island affair things have been moving at such a clip that there probably wo n't be any vacations for any of us at any time . We have people coming in from places like Westchester and sniffing around and pretending to be customers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a store like this back home . There was also a Harvard graduate student recently who asked a lot of probing questions , but he turned out to be merely a devout gas-station buff making inquiries about this site on behalf of the Society for the Preservation of Industrial Antiquities . " " The thing we 're proudest of is that so much of our store is itself an example of energy conservation , " Mr. Robinson said . " We actually depend for our operation on the equipment we sell . " He waved a hand toward a cozily warm cast-iron wood stove , with a **29;6250;TOOLONG price tag . " This little number will give you the best B.T.U.s for your dollar , " he said . He pointed ceilingward to an odd-looking light fixture . " That bulb is fluorescent rather than incandescent and has its own built-in transformer , " he said . " It burns twenty-two watts and gives out a seventy-two-watt light . We have solar collectors on our roof that provide us with hot water . Professor George Wald stopped by while they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he seemed also when we had a belly dancer perform at a party fora woman who has written a children 's book about solar energy . " Mr. Robinson moved a few feet and flicked a switch , and another bulb glowed . " Power from the windmill outside , " he said . " For Christmas , we put a tree on the windmill platform , and the windmill lit up its bulbs . " Switching the light off again , he continued , " The bedrock of our business is multifuel boilers . You can burn almost anything in them  --  oil , wood , coal , gas . They cost about thirty-five hundred , installed . Did you know that every time you burn a cord of wood you save between a hundred and fifty and two hundred gallons of oil ? " " Our finest wood stoves are jowls , from Norway , but they 're hard to come by right now , " Mr. Johansson said . " There 's been an explosion of demand for them in Scandinavia . I understand that jowl sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " A lot of our customers have five acres or more of woodland , " Mr. Robinson said , " and with half a dozen acres , depending on how much wood you hum , you can keep yourself nicely supplied if you far m your wood right . " Mr. Johansson excused himself to attend to a young woman in a quilted thermal jacket who needed two pieces of pipe for a secondhand J0tul she 'd been lucky enough to pick up somewhere else . " We have merchandise to suit every purse , " Mr. Robinson said . " Some of our biggest pre-Christmas sales , as sort of stocking presents , f guess , were in- ? ? sulators  --  only two dollars and fifteen cents per  --  to put behind the switch plates of electrical outlets . That 's one area where people unwittingly squander enormous amounts of energy . Some of our customers are beginning to show a lot of interest in do-it-yourself chimney brushes , with a fibre-glass rod that bends ninety degrees , so you can sweep your chimney from your hearth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , this season  --  right up there with our water-conserving shower heads . The bestsellers among our three hundred and fifty book titles are , month in and month out , the Bibles of our field ? The Solar Home Book , ' The Passive Solar Energy Book , ' and ' The Solar Greenhouse Book . ' " Tohansson rejoined us , and said , " The academic people seem especially attracted to our solar beanies , which have a propeller that whirls in a dead calm , and to our solar music boxes , which are powered by a photovoltaic cell . One Cantabrigian dropped in the other day and said that he had given his wife one of these for her birthday , and that she had it on a window ledge , and that she was feeling terribly depressed about Three Mile Island , and that suddenly the sun came out and ' Edelweiss ' began playing , and she smiled and said , ' My God , there 's still some hope .

Can you believe it I mean to say , he was an American and he told me a piece of cauliflower was a cruditi ..

At Avery Fisher Hall one evening , Luciano Pavarotti , large , cheerful , and overwhelming in a navy-blue suit , was rehearsing some of the songs he was planning to sing in several forthcoming concerts , including one on New Year 's Eve . He stood gripping the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sailed through Verdi 's " Celeste Aida " ? normally a tenor 's nightmare  --  with the casual enthusiasm of a folk singer recalling one of his favorite ballads . He took the final high B-flat in mezzo voce  --  as it was written with a broad smile on his bearded face , and held the note until we thought his lungs would crack . Then he released his grip on the piano , turned to Mr. Wustman , and said , " Basta . The sound is O.K. Now we must decide on some happy encores for the New Year 's Eve . " Mr. Wustman suggested several titles , and Mr. Pavarotti picked out " Tra voi , belle , " from Puccini 's " Manon Lescaut , " and sang it through . As he finished , ABC and NBC tele vision crews hurried in , and , after some consultation with Mr. Pavarotti 's manager , Herbert Breslin , Mr. Wustman struck up the opening bars of " Auld Lang Syne . " Mr. Breslin handed the singer a very large empty champagne bottle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sing , " Domani in nu lascerai , E non tornera ; . " Halfway through the song , he forgot the Italian lyrics and , rolling his eyes toward the ceiling , began to hum , beating time with the champagne bottle . " I must learn exactly for tomorrow night , " Mr. Pavarotti said when the music stopped . " You know , in Italy we do n't sing this song at capo d'anno . We sing it when a friend we love is leaving us . We sing it when somebody goes into the Army , and we always cry . But it is for you a happy song . " " No , it 's really a memory song , " said Mr. Breslin . " But all memory songs are sad , " Mr , Pavarotti insisted . He turned the empty bottle sidewise , held it up to his mouth in a flute-playing position , and began to whistle an intricately florid coloratura passage from " Lucia di Lammermoor , " using his eyebrows to punctuate the high notes . " Maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said as the circle of photographers broke into laughter . Mr. Pavarotti 's eyes crinkled with amusement . " If I sing the mad scene from Lucia like that , " he said , " there are very many sopranos who would kill me dead . " " Especially if you sing it accurately , " said Mr. Breslin . " Now , Luciano , open the other bottle and let 's all have some champagne . " ? TWENTY blocks to the south , in a rehearsal studio at the Minskoff Theatre , Ron Field , the choreographer , was polishing a series of dance routines he had invented for " Baryshnikov on Broadway , " a television special that will he taped on the West Coast in mid-January . At one end of a large , hare room , a pianist and a drummer were collaborating on the title song from " Hello , Dolly ! " In front of a wall of mirrors , the two stars of the show  --  Mikhail Baryshnikov and Liza Minnelli  --  were dancing up a storm . They were dressed in baggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes , and broad-brimmed straw hats , and they carried polished black canes . Side by side , they soft-shoed across the floor in a series of complicated crossover steps , mugging at their reflections . Then they turned away from each other and strutted around the room and back to the center to hoof in place for a boffo vaudeville finale . " It 's the trenches , " said Minnelli . " It 's what ? " said Baryshnikov , looking puzzled . Baryshnikov , who was decompressing from twenty years of rigorous ballet training , was obviously fascinated by his new dance vocabulary . He threw out one hip , thrust his shoulders forward in a Tenth Avenue slouch , bent his knees , and turned in his feet , watching the results carefully in the mirror . Minnelli plunged into the routine with unself-conscious abandon , and the impact of her energy and theatricality on the rather cool Baryshnikov persona raised the temperature in the room . For the next number  --  a Charleston from " The Boy Friend " ? the two dancers faced each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flailing mass of frantically kicking arms and legs . Then they did a hit of the " Wilkommen " routine from " Cabaret ; " a sensuous " Big Spender , " from " Sweet Charity " ( during which Minnelli unexpectedly let her big voice bounce around the room ) ; a hit of stamping flamenco from " West Side Story ; " and a hot enough " Too Darn Hot , " from " Kiss Me , Kate . " The rehearsal ended with a rambunctious cancan ( from the show of the same name ) , which began with a mild flirtation ( Minnelli pranced around Baryshnikov , inviting him to dance ) and ended with some spectacular scissors leaps ( from Baryshnikov ) and the traditional high kicks and splits ( from Minnelli ) . Halfway through this number , Minnelli , who was just managing to keep up with her partner , failed to make a tricky inside turn that was supposed to bring her down front and to the left of Baryshnikov . Field stopped the music and asked if she 'd like him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head vehemently and said , " Criminy . I did n't make it this time , but I made it before , did n't I ? Well , if I did it once , I can do it again . " Baryshnikov , evidently impressed by her determination , walked over and danced next to Minnelli , counting the beats slowly and marking the steps to make sure that she reached the right spot at the right moment . " Here in the corner , you turn flat , " he said , demonstrating a quick spin on the heel with knees bent , his right shoulder down , acting as a pivot . Minnelli followed him and then sank into a split on the floor as Barysh nikov whirled around on one toe next to her . " Now , that 's one place where I ca n't possibly catch you , " she said , looking up at him with a grin . When the two dancers threw themselves on the floor to rest , Field sat down nearby and told us that Baryshnikov had picked up jazz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrible time making the transition to jazz , because it 's a totally different kind of body movement , " he said . " They are trained to a style that involves flowing movement and graceful gestures . But jazz dancing , as it 's been developed by jack Cole , Michael Bennett , and Bob Fosse , uses the whole body more aggressively , to make a point in an intensely personal way . It requires total control  --  the relaxed , ' loose ' look is strictly an illusion and , technically , it 's a way of making the chest , the hips , and the knees come right out at you and say Hi , want to buy ? ' to the audience . At the moment , Liza , who 's danced with me for fourteen years , can do my particular style of work better than Misha can . But there 's a great sense of friendly competition developing between them , and in three weeks they 'll be absolutely together .
