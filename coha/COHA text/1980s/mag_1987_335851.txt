Jim Cantrell , the chief financial officer of a San Diego diving-suit manufacturer , has been known to drive ten miles to his office on a Saturday just to play Starflight on his IBM Personal Computer . Jim Bonevac , a senior economist for the state of Virginia , likes to spend lunch hours playing APBA Baseball and other games on his Leading Edge computer . Peter , a San Francisco marketing representative , uses lunch breaks to get in rounds of Mean 18 golf on an IBM PC Model AT , although he feels guilty enough about fooling around on the company computer to shut off the game the moment he hears the boss coming his way . <P> Who said office computers could only be used for work ? Machines designed to juggle equations , balance budgets , process words and draw graphs are now also capable of bringing a little fun and adventure to the corporate routine  --  either after hours or on the sly during the workday . Of the 15 million personal-computer games sold in the U.S. last year , according to Ingram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed for the most popular business machines : the IBM PC , the Apple Macintosh and such IBM- compatible brands as Compaq , Epson , Leading Edge and Tandy .

" The general thinking was that the average player was a 17-year-old geek with pimples who wanted to blow up spaceships , " says Chris Crawford , a former game designer at Atari who now writes programs independently for both business and home computers . " Publishers are just beginning to realize there is another market out there . " <P> To exploit that market , software houses are busy developing adult-oriented games that are more sophisticated than Pac-Man and Donkey Kong and can be played as easily on a keyboard as with a joy stick . Programmer Crawford 's current best seller , for example , is Mindscape 's Balance of Power ( $49.95 ) , a foreign policy simulation in which the player tries to check Soviet expansion in as many as 62 different countries without starting a nuclear war . In Starflight by Electronic Arts ( $49.95 ) , players explore some 270 star systems and 800 simulated planets , zapping aliens all the way . Infocom has even come out with an " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $34.95 to $39.95 ) , which features a band of Martian sirens bent on turning earth into their " private pleasure palace .
