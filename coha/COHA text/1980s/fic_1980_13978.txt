Night in New Mexico is dark and flat . And if you are alone , you are always lost , even if you think you know where you are going . There are two strays in this night , headed straight for each other , but they do n't know that . We see their faces but we did n't know where they are . We only know that they are alone , and they are dealing with their respective problems as best they can , determined to reach what they think is a safe place , the company of other humans . The Outlaw takes his saddle off the horse and ties up the cinches so he can carry it . And he talks . THE OUTLAW Well , old girl , I 've shot better horses than you , but never one I felt so kin to , at the moment . ( And now , from another part of the blackness comes a terrified voice , a shaky praying voice . ) ARCHIE Jesus God in heaven , it 's Archie Tucker from Clovis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I know you can see that coyote that 's following me and I do n't know if he 's alone , but I 'm alone and I need you to keep him back there till I can run for the cookshack , which should n't be too much longer , now , thank you so much , Amen . THE OUTLAW ( Taking off the bridle . ) I just do n't have any choice about shootin ' you , see . I ca n't just leave you here to die by yourself . And I ca n't hobble along with you or I 'll miss Lily . I told her I 'd be there at midnight , sharp . Nice and easy , girl , here it comes . ( And we hear the gunshot , and Archie hears it too , but he has other concerns. ) p. 3 ARCHIE Uh , Lord , you gave me a gun , I know , but Henry , that 's my brother , he 's got it standing guard back at the cookshack . So it 's just you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him but I imagine I 'd die , if you know what I mean . People die out here all the time and nobody ever knows . Tell you what , I 'll run when I can . THE OUTLAW You know who I miss ? That gelding . Suzy . Snaggletooth horse . She was ! Who am I talking to . Just pick up your gear and walk , old man . Just another mile , buddy . Lily always ha an eye for horseflesh , did n't she ? She 'll bring you somethin ' sweet to ride , you can count on that , at least . ( And we hear him begin to walk . ) ARCHIE Uh , Lord , in case you saw me ride into town today , maybe you got me mixed up with the rest of the boys stayed in town toall right , but I do n't like to even say it . They stayed in town to drink beer and abuse women . I am not one of them , I am saved and I need some help here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot . Well , listen , forget about everybody else for a while . This is serious . THE OUTLAW Well what have we got up here ? Looks like some kind of cookshack , some wheat-threshing crew I guess . Well sure it is . It 's the water hole , is n't it ? Only water for twenty miles , as I remember . Think she 's here yet ? Think she 's as old as you are ? Think she 's gon na show up at all ? What do you do if she do n't , huh ? p. 4 ARCHIE ( His voice showing his relief . ) Oh now , there 's the cookshack , I can just about make it now . Thank you so much . ( Screaming . ) Run , Archie ! THE OUTLAW ( Hearing Archie . ) What the hell ? ( And now we see the cookshack and the barrels and benches that huddle around it . It is a small wood building on wheels with one door , one window , and a metal chimney for ventilation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground on all sides protecting the sleeping area underneath it . You wonder how it continues to stand up , but you have no doubt that it does . There are some curiously modern-looking machine parts lying around , but otherwise , the scene looks almost pre-Civil War . And Archie runs up to the cookshack terrified . ) ARCHIE Henry ! Hey in there , Henry Tucker ! ( Banging on the cookshack door . ) You got ta hear what just happened to me when I 'm coming back from town just now . ( Jumps up to the window , trying to wake Henry . ) Henry ! Wake up ! I know you 're in there , Henry , and you know who this is so you open this door , Henry . ( Still no answer . ) Did you know they were gon na stay in town all night ? Get cleaned up , that 's what they said . But then ( Screaming . ) Henry ! ( And the door finally opens. ) p. 5 ARCHIE Nobody acts right out here . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train runs both ways , Archie . ARCHIE You 're not gon na believe what happened , Henry ! HENRY ( Starting to build the fire back up , not eager to hear anything . ) It wo n't be worth wakin ' up for , I can tell that already . ARCHIE I jumped off the train , only right away I 'm not alone , see . I turn around and there he was , standing sideways in the road , the biggest coyote I ever saw . So I started up walking again , but when I speeded up , he speeded up and when I slowed down , he slowed down and finally , I got where I could see the cookshack and took off running and here I am . HENRY And that 's your big story ? ARCHIE I mean , I could hardly breathe there for a while . HENRY You run away ? Damn right it 's your big story . Got a problem ? Call Henry or run away . Runt coward . You make me sick , Archie . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along . Dad 's probably still laughing at me stuck out here with you . ARCHIE I 've got as much right to be here as you do . They hired us both . Mr. White says I 'm a good worker . p. 6 HENRY They hired you because they could n't get me unless they took you . What do you know about threshing wheat , Archie ? They all laugh at you , you know . You 're a joke , Archie . ARCHIE Well just how hard do you think the boys would laugh if they saw your pillow full of outlaw books , huh ? Every spare minute you get , sneaking off to ride with the Wild Bunch , fighting the Johnson County War . HENRY The Wild Bunch did n't fight the Johnson County War . ARCHIE Well who cares whether they did or they did n't ? That stuff is made up , Henry . People write those books just to find out if anybody 's dumb enough to believe it . HENRY ' Bout like the Bible , I guess . ARCHIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the water and get swallowed by whales , Archie ? ARCHIE It has to be the truth , Henry . What do you think God 's trying to do , entertain ? HENRY Just leave me alone , okay . Just go to bed , Diddly . ARCHIE Do n't call me that ! HENRY Just do n't say one more word to me , you think you can do that ? I get rid of you for one night in my whole life and what do you do ? Take the train right on back here . p. 7 ARCHIE You 're just mad about Corbin in town spendin ' all your pay you gambled off last night . It serves you right , pulling your gun like one of your outlaws , for God 's sake . I hope you learned your lesson . HENRY They 've had it in for me since the beginning of this job , Archie . I do n't know who they think they are , these cowboys , they 're just as dumb and just as worn out as everybody else I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I showed ' em , that 's all . Now , you just watch and see if anybody ever tries to cheat Henry Tucker again . What do I want to go into town for anyway ? Have a good time with that bunch of know-it-alls ? Fat chance . ARCHIE Oh I almost forgot ! Guess what else I saw in town ? Marines signing up men for the war . It 's all over the papers too . Some Archduke Somebody-or-other got killed and it 's all about to blow up ! HENRY ( Not the least bit interested . ) What is ? ARCHIE The world , Henry ! Unless we get there in time ! HENRY So why did n't you join up ? ARCHIE Mother would kill me ! HENRY So would a war , Archie . ARCHIE You could go ! You 're exactly who they 're lookin ' for ! They 're gon na fly airplanes in this war , Henry ! You 'd like that , zoomin ' around the sky . You could be The Outlaw of the Air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take you , Archie . You 'd be out there on the front lines , walk over to the enemy and say , " Hi there ; my name is Archie and these are my buddies , this is Ralph and this is Joey and we 're from New Mexico , " and you 'd be the first marine who ever died in the middle of a sentence . ( Archie turns away . ) HENRY What 's the matter with you ? Guys like us go to war and we do n't get to fly airplanes . We just stand on the ground and get shot . Do n't make any sense at all , Archie . I can do that here . ARCHIE He told me I could learn to fly a plane . I asked him and he said , " Come on . " HENRY Just shut up . You do n't know what you 're talking about . ARCHIE Okay . Okay . ( And then , in a moment of silence , they hear a twig break just behind the cookshack . ) ARCHIE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fear . ) Well , it sure as hell ai n't the marines . ( Henry picks up a stick of wood from the fire and Archie backs away , toward Henry for protection . The Outlaw appears , gun raised , from the other direction , surprising them both . The Outlaw looks quite different than when we saw him before . Maybe it 's the effect of the gun in his hand . Maybe he likes horses better than people . Whatever it is , this is somebody you do n't want to fool around with . This man looks dangerous. ) p. 9 THE OUTLAW Keep on talking , boy . ( Waving the pistol at Henry . ) Hands high , cowboy . ( Henry is reluctant . Archie raises his hands . ) THE OUTLAW Not you , boy . You sit . Over there . Him . Up . ARCHIE Henry ! THE OUTLAW That 's better . Do n't need any heroes here . Just a little hospitality . ( Starts to search Henry . ) HENRY What do you want , gramps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Oh , I do n't know . What have you got ? ARCHIE Anything you want . You just name it . HENRY ( Turning quickly . ) Shut up , Archie . THE OUTLAW ( Poking Henry with the gun , not liking that fast turn . ) Careful , cowboy . ARCHIE His name 's Henry . HENRY Shut up , Archie ! ( Then quickly . ) How long have you been out there ? THE OUTLAW ( Still very threatening . ) Long enough . You do n't look a thing alike . p. 10 ARCHIE He takes after Dad . That whole side of the family is  --  HENRY Shut up , Archie . The man 's not here to get a family history . What do you want , mister ? THE OUTLAW Eggs . Cooked . HENRY No . ARCHIE I 'll make ' em , Henry , if you want me to . HENRY I said no . THE OUTLAW Yes . And if you got a gun in the cookshack , there , you just bring it right on out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you go get it and then you 'll draw on me and I 'll kill you . Wo n't be anything personal , just how it happens to me anymore . I get what I want . Now , I want some eggs . HENRY Any man can walk in hungry and ask for eggs and I 'll make ' em , any day , but you ai n't asked . THE OUTLAW Are we gon na fight over a mess of eggs ? ARCHIE ( Trying to be reasonable . ) I said I 'd make the eggs . The man 's a stranger here and we should  --  HENRY ( Stops him , rough . ) Do n't you move . You do what I say . p. 11 ARCHIE Then you do what he says . HENRY Do n't tell me what to do ! ARCHIE I 'm not . What do I know ? It 's justyou do see the gun , do n't you , Henry ? We 're just talking about some old eggs , Henry . THE OUTLAW Do n't you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he heads for the cookshack . ) THE OUTLAW And bring me some whiskey . ARCHIE We do n't have any whiskey . We got a rule about it . THE OUTLAW If you did n't have any whiskey , you would n't have a rule about it . ( And now , the Outlaw walks behind the water barrels to retrieve his saddle and a leather satchel . He puts the saddle over a bale of hay to make a kind of seat , but he does n't sit on it . Archie watches as long as he can before he talks . ) ARCHIE Are you gon na kill us ? THE OUTLAW I 'm gon na eat first . ARCHIE That 's not fair ! We 're minding our own business . It 's Saturday night . We threshed wheat all week , we work hard . Then we get a night off and you come up and shoot us . It 's not fair . It 's not civilized . We 're a state now . It 's 1914. p. 12 THE OUTLAW Do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says a funny thing to some other person and the other person laughs ? ( No response . ) THE OUTLAW Do you ? Joke ? Ha-ha ? ARCHIE I know that . THE OUTLAW Then why did n't you laugh at my joke ? ARCHIE Are you gon na kill us or not ? THE OUTLAW Are you always like this ? ( No response . ) THE OUTLAW What time is it ? ARCHIE Oh , you 're meeting somebody here ! What a good idea . It 's a perfect place for it . Why did n't you say that in the first place . Maybe we 've seen ' em already . Nope . Nobody for hours now , well , what do I know ? I just got back myself . Maybe Henry saw somebody . Who 're we lookin ' for ? Tall ? Thin ? THE OUTLAW I just asked you what time it was . ARCHIE Oh . Right . I do n't know . Dark . THE OUTLAW What does Henry do ? How come he 's out here with everybody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could come back anytime , you know . There 's twenty-five or more . Big men . p. 13 THE OUTLAW ( Screaming . ) I want those eggs , cowboy ! ( Then normally . ) They call you Archie ? ARCHIE Or Doc . Some of ' em call me Doc . ( The Outlaw nods , but does n't ask why . ) ARCHIE I was sweet on Doc Porter 's girl , Sarah . They started calling me Doc because , well , Doc Porter runs the drugstore in Clovis . I 'm courting a Doc 's daughter so they call me Doc . It 's a joke . THE OUTLAW It is n't very funny for a joke . ARCHIE Or fork-pitcher . It 's what I do . I fork up the wheat and  --  THE OUTLAW  --  pitch it on the wagon , I know . What 's that big machine out there ? ARCHIE It 's a brand-new separator . Thing threshes ten times as much wheat as the old one in half the time . Gon na change everything . THE OUTLAW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Henry comes out of the cookshack carrying a steaming plate of eggs , and now wearing a light jacket . ) HENRY ( Heartily , as though he 'd cooked for a friend . ) Six eggs . Hot and ready ! ARCHIE I told you he 'd make the eggs . p. 14 THE OUTLAW ( Referring to the coat . ) Got your gun , I see . HENRY Cold out here . Eat up . That 's a clean fork . THE OUTLAW ( Walking toward Archie , picking up a forkful of eggs . ) I was asking Archie , how come you pulled this guard duty while the rest of the boys are in raisin ' hell tonight . ( He pushes the bite of eggs in Archie 's mouth . ) HENRY Somebody has to . THE OUTLAW Yeah , but why you , cowboy ? What happened last night ? HENRY It 's none of your business . THE OUTLAW Oh yes it is , too . I want to hear it . Archie will tell me , wo n't you boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archie . ) You do and I 'll  --  THE OUTLAW ( Demanding . ) Archie ! ARCHIE ( Beginning rather helplessly . ) It was just another stupid poker game . Corbin was cheating and I saw it . I told Henry and Henry drew on him That 's all . THE OUTLAW If that was all , Archie , Mr. Corbin would be out here eatin ' hay , not Henry . p. 15 HENRY ( Before Archie can start . ) You shut your mouth , priss . ( The Outlaw plays with his gun , just to terrify Archie . ) ARCHIE The gun is why Henry 's out here . Not supposed to have guns in camp , that 's all . THE OUTLAW ( Not satisfied . ) Go on . ARCHIE ( Compulsively . ) All right ! When Henry drew his gun he dropped his cards and there 's not supposed to be two ace of hearts either ! ( The Outlaw laughs . ) ARCHIE They woulda killed each other if Mr. White had n't been here . They woulda both lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square miles of wheat to thresh next week . They were acting like some saloon characters from twenty years ago . THE OUTLAW Man 's got to protect himself , Archie . ARCHIE Yeah , but he 's supposed to use his brain , not his gun . THE OUTLAW Well , you want to use the quickest thing you got , whatever that is . ARCHIE You should n't cheat till you learn how to play , Henry . HENRY You started it all , Archie . I 'd be spendin ' his money right now if it was n't for you and your big mouth . " Corbin 's cheatin ' , Henry , " like a damn idiot . p. 16 THE OUTLAW Henry 's right , Archie . You talk too much . HENRY There 's a horse comin ' . THE OUTLAW ( Quite calm , having heard it already . ) Uh-huh . HENRY ( Nodding in agreement . ) Sounds like a Morgan horse to me . THE OUTLAW ( Watching Archie , playing along . ) Black , withwhite feet . HENRY Seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't a horse by now . ) Still got all his teeth , though . ( And they laugh and Archie was completely taken in . ) ARCHIE It 's the rest of your gang , I guess . ( Then quite dispirited , to Henry . ) He asked me while ago what time it was , Henry . HENRY Relax , Archie . It 's just Mother comin ' to collect you for prayer meeting . ARCHIE I hear it now . It does n't sound like a horse at all . It sounds like an auto mobile ! ( They laugh . ) ARCHIE It does ! HENRY Archie , the closest road is five miles from here . p. 17 THE OUTLAW ( Very amused by now . ) So if it is a car , it 's a damn fool drivin ' it . ARCHIE ( Feeling quite anxious . ) How did you get here ? Where 's your horse ? THE OUTLAW ' Bout a mile back . ARCHIE I could get him for you . THE OUTLAW You could have her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shot her . ARCHIE You saw the fire and walked to here . THE OUTLAW Oh there 's no foolin ' you , is there Archie ? ARCHIE ( Staring out into the night . ) It sure is a car all right . Are they lost or what ? Who 'd come out here in a car ? ( Then as Henry and the Outlaw are both very anxious , and clearly not willing to speculate about who this might be , Archie goes on babbling . ) ARCHIE Was she a good horse ? HENRY Would you shoot a good horse , Archie ? Yes , you would . Archie would shoot a good horse if Mother told him to . ARCHIE Good horses get sick . p. 18 HENRY ( Testing the Outlaw . ) A man shoots his horse is shootin ' off his pecker , Archie . THE OUTLAW Shut up , cowboy . HENRY I was saying not to ask about it . It ai n't your business , Archie . It makes you feel bad to shoot your horse . As bad as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off your pecker so do n't make jokes about it . ARCHIE I was n't joking , I was asking . THE OUTLAW ( As the car stops . ) Archie do n't use his pecker anyway , so he would n't know . ARCHIE I do too . Use it . ( Henry and the Outlaw laugh . ) ARCHIE I water the garden . ( They laugh and he continues . ) ARCHIE I put out fires . ( More laughter . ) ARCHIE Cuts the dust right off a wagon wheel . THE OUTLAW ( Getting his gun out again . ) Go on . ARCHIE That 's all . THE OUTLAW ( Covering his nervousness about who 's coming . ) You just been doin ' chores with it ? You ai n't had any fun with it ? p. 19 ARCHIE Leave me alone . THE OUTLAW Any girls took a peek at it ? HENRY Hell , he does n't even look at it . ARCHIE Whose side are you on , Henry ? ( And now , from offstage , we hear a voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HENRY What is this ? THE OUTLAW Sounds like a lady came in a car . ARCHIE Tom ? Is that your name , Tom ? ( And Lily rushes onstage , wearing a Barney Oldfield-type duster over her long split riding skirt . It also looks very expensive , but is clearly western and meant for hard use . ) LILY Tom ! THE OUTLAW ( Reacting to the duster . ) What the hell ? LILY ( Thrilled to see him , but stops herself from running to him once she sees Archie and Henry . ) You are ! You 're still alive ! THE OUTLAW ( Concealing whatever he feels . ) Well I would n't write you to tell you I was dead ! LILY But anybody could 've written that letter . Your handwriting 's not as  --  p. 20 THE OUTLAW Take that thing off . Let me look at you . LILY ( Delighted to . ) Just a minute . I almost did n't find this place , you know . They cut down that cottonwood tree . Good thing the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . ) Now ! THE OUTLAW Oh that 's much better . You have n't changed a bit . LILY ( Walking into his arms . ) It 's going to work-out just fine , is n't it ? I 'm getting old and you 're going blind . ( And the Outlaw turns Lily around to them , not able to give her quite the greeting he wanted to , but still obviously desperate to touch her . ) ARCHIE Did you really come all the way out here in a car ? LILY Big black Buick . Go see for yourself ! ( Archie starts off toward the car , but Henry stops him . ) THE OUTLAW Lily , this is the Tucker Brothers . Archie and Cowboy . ARCHIE His name 's Henry . THE OUTLAW Boys , meet Lily . LILY ( She nods to them , but talks to the Outlaw . ) What a ride ! That 's at least forty miles ! And there 's no road at all for the last five ! p. 21 THE OUTLAW ( Starting for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you sit down a minute and  --  HENRY ( Disgusted . ) Look , folks . This ai n't exactly Main Street out here . Could you take your visit on down the road so we can get some sleep ? THE OUTLAW ( Ignoring Henry and walking her to the bench . ) There 's no road , remember ? LILY Boy , we 're in big trouble if we have a blowout out here , I guess I could have rented a horse , but oh , Tom , ( In a mock scolding. ) where have you been ? HENRY ( Irritated ? but beginning to be curious . ) How come he could n't meet you in town ? Been a helluva lot easier to find . THE OUTLAW ( Breaking away from Lily . ) Can you shut your mouth and do whatever I tell you to do ? Can you get the lady a drink and not ask any stupid questions , cowboy ? ( Henry does n't move . ) THE OUTLAW And I told you while ago I wanted some whiskey but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I ? Move ! HENRY One drink and you go ? THE OUTLAW Get it . ( And Henry goes into the cookshack and the Outlaw turns back to Lily. ) p. 22 THE OUTLAW Why the hell did you buy an automobile ? LILY For the horn . I like the horn . A little man brought it . I kept him too . Heworks on it . ARCHIE That 's where I saw you ! Outside that fancy hotel in town . LILY Oh Tom , you would n't know the old place now . It 's solid white paint , no wallpaper . There 's actually trees growing in barrels all along that front hall . Oh and the dining room is this bright green and Roy Luther hooked me up a waterfall , inside the dining room . And I 'm about ready to go order another automobile to pick up my guests at the train station . They come in hot and thirsty and see those trees and that waterfall and they feel like staying a week . ARCHIE I saw that car too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think she 's pretty ? ARCHIE She 's pretty . THE OUTLAW You got any money ? ARCHIE I worked hard for it , if I do , and I 'm not handing it over , no sir . THE OUTLAW Money for the lady . How much you got ? ARCHIE I 'm not interested in that . LILY And the price has gone way up , mister . p. 23 THE OUTLAW You squirmy little mole . Tell me how much money you got ! ARCHIE Twenty-eight dollars . THE OUTLAW You could have this pretty lady , all day , all night for a solid month with that money . All to yourself , just you and her . You ever thought about that ? ARCHIE No . ( Henry comes out with the whiskey . ) THE OUTLAW Do you know what you 're going to be when you grow up ? ARCHIE No . THE OUTLAW Sorry , that 's what . ( And the Outlaw and Henry have a good laugh about that . ) LILY Do you know what year this is ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's a hotel now and I own it . THE OUTLAW ( Clearly annoyed . ) A little pride goes a long way , girl . LILY I told them you were still alive . I just knew it . Roy Luther said Bob Ford got you . HENRY Bob Ford got Jesse James . LILY Daisy said it was Frank Canton . HENRY ( More energy than we 've seen from him all night . ) He got Nate Champion at the Johnson County War . p. 24 LILY Gus figured it was the Pinkertons . Chase you down like Kid Curry . HENRY Kid Curry killed himself . THE OUTLAW And I bet you know where . HENRY I do , that 's true . Parachute , Colorado . ARCHIE Henry believes in outlaws . HENRY Shut up , Archie . LILY ( Laughs . ) Roy Luther swore he saw it in the papers . THE OUTLAW He saw Bill and Fred . They got Bill and Fred . HENRY Bill Carver ? THE OUTLAW Bill my brother . His boy Fred . Nice boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . HENRY What name ? THE OUTLAW ( Ignoring Henry . ) Well , how do I look ? Old ? HENRY Hey , your eggs got cold before you finished them . How ' bout some more eggs . THE OUTLAW We are n't gon na be here long enough for that , cowboy . HENRY Sure you are . The lady 's tired and you could use some more food , pops . It looks like it 's been a while . You want anything , ma'am ? Might be a corn stick left from supper . p. 25 LILY No thank you . HENRY Well , you just let me know if you change your mind . And just take your time there . We 're glad to have you . Gets awful lonely out here . ARCHIE ( Dumbfounded but pleased by this change in Henry . ) See how nice Henry can be when he wants to ? LILY Have you seen Bub Meeks ? THE OUTLAW Lost a leg in prison , last I heard . HENRY They shot him trying to escape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well you 're a real Outlaw expert , are n't you cowboy ? HENRY Want your eggs sunny-side up this time ? THE OUTLAW ( Now eager to get rid of him . ) That sounds good . HENRY Comin ' right up . ( He goes into the cookshack . ) LILY Anybody else ? THE OUTLAW They 're in Bolivia , you know . Butch is alive . ARCHIE That 's in South America . THE OUTLAW Thank you . ARCHIE I go to school . p. 26 THE OUTLAW Or dead . Bolivia or dead . ARCHIE I do n't get it . THE OUTLAW I was n't talking to you . ARCHIE Your folks , is that it ? THE OUTLAW Yeah , boy . My folks all died . ARCHIE Or went to Bolivia . THE OUTLAW ( Ignoring Archie . ) I 've got a new picture with me . I want you to take it to the Western Union and switch it . Burn that one from Telluride . LILY I always thought it was better of Butch than you . THE OUTLAW This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture made for my birthday . Beside my Buick . In front of my hotel . Wearing my duster and goggles . Looks like I cut it out of a magazine but it 's me all right . ARCHIE Are we talking about a wanted poster ? THE OUTLAW We were . LILY Well actually , he was . ARCHIE You want them to catch you ? THE OUTLAW No , I do n't want them to catch me . But I do want them to know what I look like now . I got my pride . ( To Lily . ) You 're prettier than you were . p. 27 LILY It 's the money . Are you going to Bolivia ? THE OUTLAW It 's a long trip , but I bet they 'd make you the goddamn queen of Bolivia . ARCHIE Do you speak Spanish ? They speak Spanish . THE OUTLAW ( Furious with him . ) If I want to go to Bolivia , I 'll go to Bolivia . They have tin mines there . Did you learn that in school ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green bananas and I 'll lay around with this lady and have our dinner cooked by some mountain kid about your age who knows not to say a goddamned thing like who are you or what do you want . Except he will say good morning and thank you , muchas gracias . And we 'll have a wonderful time and we wo n't think about you or all the people like you back here building houses and running for mayor . ARCHIE This is the best country in the world ! I could be president ! THE OUTLAW That 's why we 're talking about Bolivia ! What 's the matter with you ? LILY You ca n't go to Bolivia either . The trip alone would kill you . And how do you know you like bananas ? THE OUTLAW Do n't you want to see the lady 's car , boy ? ( And Archie gets out of there quickly , knowing they want to be alone. ) p. 28 THE OUTLAW Got a kiss for the old man ? ( They kiss and we see him relax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) You look awfully tired , Tom . I heard you were working horses in Montana , but you look like you 've been living in a cave . THE OUTLAW ( A sense of purpose now ) I 've beenseeing your face . LILY This face ? Or the old one . The young one ? THE OUTLAW I meanI think about you . LILY I waited for you to come back , you know . I kept eggs in the house for two years for you . THE OUTLAW Well , here I am , girl . LILY ( She has a small laugh . ) So I see . THE OUTLAW ( Impatient as always . ) You know what I want . Yes or no ? LILY Yes or no what ? I 've seen you one day in the last twenty years ! THE OUTLAW Helluva day . LILY What do you want , Tom ? THE OUTLAW ( Her directness backs him off . ) Well , like I said in my letter , I ( The more he looks at her , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles to say . ) I had some business down this way . p. 29 LILY What business ? Twenty years is a long time . Things happen . Tell me what your business is . Tell me what you want me to say yes or no to . Then ask me . A girl needs to hear a man talk a little . THE OUTLAW About what ? LILY No , do n't say anything now . I 'm rested enough , I think . Come back to town with me . You 'll be safe enough . They all think you 're dead anyway . And if anybody asks who you are , which they wo n't , I 'll say you 're my father . ( He backs off even further . ) I 'll get you whatever you want to eat and you can stay as long as you like . You 'll like the hotel , there 's lots of fancy eastern folks coming through all the time and we 're getting out telephone next month so  --  THE OUTLAW Whatever happened to your rancher friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right I did . LILY ( Trying to regain his attention . ) He died . Tom . Roy Luther is dying to see you . It 'll be just like you remember . You 'll get a bath and some sleep and you can tell me everything you 've done for the last  --  THE OUTLAW You want to hear me talk ? LILY I want to know if you 're still the man I knew , that 's all . p. 30 THE OUTLAW Well , the girl I knew LILY Is right here , Tom . THE OUTLAW Woulda brought me a horse . ( And the Outlaw stands up now , and Henry opens the cookshack door , and Archie returns from looking at the car . ) ARCHIE ( Running up to Henry , a conspiratorial tone in his voice . ) He 's an outlaw , Henry . They 've got his picture at the Western Union . HENRY He 's no outlaw , Archie . Just some old prospector lost track of the mother lode , huh , pops ? You were pannin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we got plenty more inside . Take this one when you 're through with the eggs . ARCHIE Henry , he 's with Butch Cassidy in this picture . They 're at Telluride in this picture . HENRY ( Appreciating the clue . ) Is that so ? Well , Cassidy 's in Bolivia , now , Archie , and if this guy was anybody he 'd be down there with him , so maybe they were just in a bar together sometime or Cassidy sold him a horse . LILY Butch sold you a horse , oh that 's funny . HENRY ( Very cagey . ) Yeah , Cassidy did n't know much about horses , did he ma'am . The real expert was that doctor 's son in the gang . What did your old man do , mister ? p. 31 ARCHIE They 're going to Bolivia , Henry . That 's what he came to ask her . HENRY Only she wo n't go . Or I know , she wo n't go on a horse and he wo n't go in a car ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him any ideas , Henry . ( The Outlaw laughs . ) THE OUTLAW Would you like to see a holdup , Archie ? LILY Come on . Eat your eggs and let 's get out of here . HENRY Relax , Archie . A holdup is quick . A holdup would be over by now . Unless of course , you forgot how to pull one . ARCHIE ( Trying to stay in Henry 's good graces . ) Yeah , you 're supposed to bust in here . No , first you ride up on your horse . You do n't shoot your horse first . ( Expecting Henry to be pleased . ) You ride up on your horse , you slam open the doors , you say everybody does what I say and nobody gets hurt . ( The Outlaw laughs . ) ARCHIE And then you say up against the wall . HENRY No wall , Archie . ARCHIE The cookshack and spread your arms . THE OUTLAW Situation like this , I 'd say down on the ground , Archie. p. 32 ARCHIE Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Pointing the gun at them . ) All right . Down on the ground , boys ( They hesitate . ) THE OUTLAW Now ! LILY What are you doing ? ARCHIE Her too ? THE OUTLAW I rode a thousand miles to see her . I do n't want her dirty . LILY If this is for my benefit , you can stop right now because I 've seen it , outlaw . Get up , you two . We 're leaving right this minute . ( And as Lily starts to move , the Outlaw grabs her , rough , and pushes her back down on the bench . Archie sees this and ducks his head even further into the ground . ) ARCHIE Throw our money over to you ? HENRY Why do n't you just shut up , Archie . THE OUTLAW Yeah , let 's have your money . HENRY Do n't have mine on me . ARCHIE Mine 's in my bedroll , inside . THE OUTLAW See , Archie ? I knew that already . ARCHIE She could get it for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HENRY So what are we doin ' with our face in the dirt ? THE OUTLAW ( Laughs . ) Ask Archie . It was his idea . ( Henry sits up , furious with Archie , and slaps him hard with his hat . ) ARCHIE Can we sit up ? THE OUTLAW Sure . ARCHIE ( Aware of Henry 's rage . ) Could you just tell us what you want so we could give it to you so you could go on , wherever you 're goin ' ? THE OUTLAW Who says I 'm goin ' anywhere ? I 'm gettin ' what I want . A visit . Hear some stories , see some people . I have n't seen any people for a long time . ARCHIE Why not ? LILY Because he acts like this , Archie . ARCHIE I mean , what is this ? Who are you ? HENRY You mind your own business . ARCHIE This feels like my business to me . HENRY It 's his past , it 's his business . ARCHIE I can ask the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why should I ? So he wo n't know we 're scared ? HENRY I 'm not scared . I 'm sick to death of you . ARCHIE Me ? What about him ? He 's the one ordered you around all night . He 's got his gun in our face and you 're sick to death of me ? I do n't get you , Henry . HENRY You never have . You do n't know a thing about me . ARCHIE Oh I get it . If she wo n't go with him , you will , is that it ? You 'll just disappear to Bolivia like one of your books come to life and I 'll have to tell Mr. White what happened in the morning ? Let Dad sit around the rest of his life wondering whatever happened to Henry while I 'm out doing your work on the ranch ? Well , why do n't you tell him how many shots it took you to nail that coyote in the barn last year . HENRY ( Slaps him hard . ) And why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I 've had you hanging around my neck as long as I can remember and if I decide to cut you loose , Diddly , nobody 's ever gon na know . ARCHIE What does that mean ? THE OUTLAW It means he 's not on your side , Archie . Nobody is really , when you get right down to it , out here . LILY ( Trying a different approach . ) Look , I 'm sorry you two got in the middle of this . It 's just two old friends getting together someplace safe , all right ? We 'll be on our way now . p. 35 HENRY He ca n't go into town , girl . His draw 's so shaky he would n't last two minutes . THE OUTLAW ( Drawing his gun as he turns . ) Shoot him first ? HENRY ( Grabbing Archie like a shield . ) Him first ! THE OUTLAW That 's fine . Get you both with one shot . HENRY ( Jumping away from Archie . ) God that was fast ! You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let 's see if the kid can dance ! LILY Now you look here ! THE OUTLAW ( Laughs . ) Shoot at his feet , you mean ? ARCHIE Henry ! You 're not reading this in some book . What the hell are you doing ? HENRY Something I should 've done a long time ago . Looking out for myself . He needs somebody to ride with him and I 'm it ! We 'll take two of the horses off this place and be on our way . THE OUTLAW ( Quickly throwing Henry a rope . ) You better tie him up so he do n't follow us . HENRY ( Catches the rope and grabs Archie . ) Yeah boy ! p. 36 LILY Tom ! Put that gun away ! This is ridiculous ! ( The Outlaw is just as surprised as Lily is that Henry is willing to tie Archie up , but he does n't show Henry that . ) ARCHIE What did I ever do to you ? HENRY Are you kidding ? My whole life I spent so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airplanes , so you could go to church . I 'm out there feedin ' half-starved cattle and raisin ' scrub crops , still workin ' for Dad when I ought a be long gone all because you ca n't do nuthin ' and never could . The most help you can ever be is just get out of my way , Archie . All you ever think about is where your next bath is comin ' from and tell ' em , Archie , what are you saving your money for ? LILY ( Furious . ) I 'm leaving right this minute and Archie 's coming with me . Get whatever you need and let 's get out of here . ( Henry trips Archie to make him fall down and to make it clear that Archie 's not going anywhere . Henry starts to tie Archie up , and he 's real rough about it . ) ARCHIE ( An appeal to Lily . ) I 'm saving for a buggy . I already ordered the lap robe and harness . ( Then to Henry . ) You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't even ask . I 'm gon na be somebody . p. 37 HENRY Somebody 's aunt , that 's what you 'll be . Dad took Archie to the Hart Ranch . They brought in forty-eight hundred head of cattle , Dad picked the hundred he wanted , then they rode with the drivers bringing the cattle back to Clovis . Know what Archie had to say about the trip ? The ranch house was dirty . ARCHIE Noisy . We slept in a room where a man was killed . There was a bullet hole in the door ! HENRY ( To the Outlaw . ) See what I mean ? ARCHIE You coulda gone on that trip except Dad knew you 'd get drunk . HENRY You ai n't goin ' nowhere now , kid . LILY What kind of man ties up his brother ? ( To the Outlaw . ) And you ! You ask me to meet you out here in the middle of nowhere after twenty years and then you wo n't even talk to me . And they do n't play this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , all right , but it 's when the school lets out for recess . Or when we celebrate Frontier Day . HENRY There . Done and tight ! That 's what I felt like my whole life , Archie . How do you like it , huh ? ( Kicks him . ) ( Henry is proud of his work . The Outlaw takes his time coming over to him. ) p. 38 THE OUTLAW Now , who are you ? HENRY What ? THE OUTLAW You heard me . ARCHIE Why do n't you tie yourself up now , Henry . HENRY Who am I ? THE OUTLAW Hard to say , huh ? HENRY You mean how old am I ? THE OUTLAW Start there , sure . HENRY Thirty . THE OUTLAW Go on . HENRY Not married . Live at the ranch . ARCHIE Lives at home . THE OUTLAW Big ranch ? HENRY Pretty big . THE OUTLAW You ride ? HENRY Ride . Good . Good rider , yeah . Rope . Shoot too . THE OUTLAW What . HENRY Shoot what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl ? This what you wanted to hear ? HENRY I shot a Navy Colt before , but a Winchester 's what 's around most of the time . If you need somebodyif it 's got a safe in it , I know Hercules powder and dynamite . p. 39 THE OUTLAW Where 'd you learn that ? ARCHIE He did n't . He 's lying . He reads Police Gazette in the barber shop . HENRY Shut up , Archie , or we 'll gag you too . THE OUTLAW Well , you look strong enough all right . HENRY Would I be inside or outside ? Lookout ? Horse-holder ? THE OUTLAW What are you like , cowboy ? HENRY What do I like ? Same as everybody . Money and a good time . THE OUTLAW No . Something you did once . Where you 've been . How you are . How you'dbe . HENRY I do n't understand . ARCHIE Something you did once , Henry . A story . HENRY Deaf Charley and Peep O'Day do n't tell stories . THE OUTLAW They 're dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you bet . The Wild Bunch . O'Day was a horse-holder . ( Turning to the Ontlaw . ) Was n't he ? ARCHIE All the outlaws are dead , Henry . HENRY ( Vicious . ) What do you know about it , Archie ? Shut up ! p. 40 LILY Do you want a blanket , Archie ? Something to drink ? ( She comes over to Archie and moves him out of their way . ) ARCHIE Why do n't you go on . This is n't gon na be a very good time here . I know Henry when he gets like this and there 's no stopping him . They wo n't hurt me . I hate this place . LILY Tom , stop this . Come home with me . Wherever you 've been , it 's been hard , I know , but I want you with me now . We 've got some catching up to do . THE OUTLAW ( Interrupting her . ) You got ta tell me something , cowboy . HENRY You know about Hole-in-the-Wall and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? THE OUTLAW You set traps for ' em ? Trail ' em through the desert ? Use your shotgun , what ? I never been on a egg hunt . ARCHIE Tell him about breaking horses , tell him about threshing soybeans with a stick . Tell him about your life , Henry . HENRY I get thirsty . It 's the same thing all the time . ARCHIE It has to last longer than that , Henry . HENRY Good story would be good company , I guess , at night . Hiding out . ( No response from the Outlaw. ) p. 41 HENRY Okay . I 'll tell you about egg hunts and you tell me about Hole-in-the-Wall . THE OUTLAW Go . HENRY ( Not enjoying this at all . It feels like school . ) The week before Easter , Mother would give us each a dozen eggs , each of us boys , marked so we 'd know whose was whose . We 'd hide ' em around the farm , this was back in Oklahoma . Then all week we 'd look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hunt for each other 's eggs and when we found some we 'd hide ' em again in a harder place where only we knew so that at the end of the week on Easter morning , the boy with the most eggs won . Now it 's your turn . THE OUTLAW Won what ? HENRY ( A sudden hostility . ) Just won . If you were smart , you buried your own eggs and ate the other ones you found . ARCHIE We knew you were doing that . THE OUTLAW You cheated at egg hunt ? HENRY I won , did n't I ? I wanted to win . ( Now brighter . ) You can start with Flat Nose Currie . Did a horse really kick him in the face ? THE OUTLAW Never knew the man . Before my time . p. 42 HENRY Well , when was your time ? THE OUTLAW I forgot . HENRY We made a deal ! THE OUTLAW So maybe I 'll cheat . You have a Christmas tree ? HENRY ( Disgusted . ) The man says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas tree . ARCHIE He 's crazy , Henry . It does n't matter who he is . He does n't have any gang to take you into . He 's just crazy . Tell him about Christmas . HENRY You 're Tom McCarty , are n't you ? THE OUTLAW McCarty is dead . Tell me why you never have any money . Tell me how you done nuthin ' for so long , Henry . Tell me why you 're still living at home . HENRY It 's none of your goddamn business ! THE OUTLAW Tell me why you tied up your brother . Nobody I know ever tied up his brother . Why 'd you do that ? I mean , we got rules out here for this sort of thing , or used to . Is this how people do now ? ' Cause if it is , I do n't want any part of it . I 'm goin ' right back where I been and I 'm stayin ' put this time . ( Now as much to Lily as Henry . ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while and look what we got for boys now . And you 're drivin ' a car and talkin ' hard , girl . p. 43 HENRY You tell me who you are ! THE OUTLAW ( Grinning . ) Kilpatrick . HENRY Dead . THE OUTLAW Sundance . HENRY Bolivia . THE OUTLAW ( Laughing , mocking . ) Nope . Dead . I 'm Billy the Kid . I 'm Jesse James . ( Henry pulls his gun , insisting on an answer . ) THE OUTLAW Okay cowboy . Now we all saw your gun . Now put it away . ( Henry cocks the pistol . ) ARCHIE Please , mister ( Then to Lily . ) Or you tell . Tell Henry who he is . THE OUTLAW ( Cooling down a little . ) I killed Tom McCarty . That help any ? HENRY ( Uncocks the pistol . ) How ? ARCHIE ( Thinks this is all ridiculous . ) Who is Tom McCarty ? HENRY Tom McCarty taught Butch Cassidy to rob banks . LILY Handsome , funny . HENRY They got ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business . HENRY Tom McCarty was smart ! LILY Smelled like wild mint and wore a long leather coat , aspen gold . HENRY I do n't believe you killed him ! LILY I loved that coat . And a green scarf around his neck . Oh my . HENRY Who are you to kill Tom McCarty ? LILY I figured somebody 'd kill him for his money someday , he had so much of it . I should 've married him . ARCHIE Did he want you to ? THE OUTLAW He did . LILY Well why did n't he say something . I was crazy for him ! THE OUTLAW He was scared . LILY You know what you have to do to forget a man like that ? You have to buy an automobile , for God 's sake . HENRY ( Finding the Outlaw 's satchel now . ) How do I know you killed him ? THE OUTLAW You do n't . ButI got his watch . ( Pitches it to Henry to make him drop the satchel . ) Maybe I bought it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I got his satchel , there . Maybe I was his friend . p. 45 HENRY This McCarty 's ? LILY Does it say Forget-me-not , LTK on the back ? HENRY It does . LILY It 's McCarty 's . I gave it to him . HENRY How did you kill him ? No . Tell us what happened to his money . She said he had a lot of money . What 's in that suitcase ? THE OUTLAW Whatever it is , it 's mine . ARCHIE What a great idea , rob an old guy out in the wheat field . LILY There 's no money in that case , Henry . It 's old wanted pictures , newspaper articles , books about his friends , books with his name in them . HENRY He 's no outlaw . Some whore sold him that watch . He 's just some horse thief , some gone-crazy sheepherder . Just a copperhead , prissy-ass grandpa . He sneaked up on the smartest bank robber in the West and shot him in cold blood . A worm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HENRY You 're gon na tell us how you killed Tom McCarty , if you killed Tom McCarty , and then we 're gon na tie you up and turn you in . Get a hundred dollars ! Outlaw Killer Killed . THE OUTLAW Look cowboy , relax . I apologize for playin ' with you like this . I 've just turned mean or something . Let 's untie the kid here and  --  p. 46 HENRY ( A serious threat . ) You touch him and you 're dead , mister . THE OUTLAW ( Much more carefully . ) That is money in that case . You 're absolutely right . I liked your eggs . I 'll give you some . HENRY ( Fairly contemptuous . ) I 'm gon na take it all , after you tell me your " story . " THE OUTLAW It 's not much of a story . McCarty did n't want to hide , and did n't want to run . He asked me to do it . HENRY Shoot him ? THE OUTLAW Bury him . ARCHIE After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just outside of Delta , Colorado . HENRY ( Quietly , but firmly . ) I know who you are . THE OUTLAW ( Bitterly . ) It 's pretty exciting , is n't it ? HENRY ( His excitement building . ) Well , I think so . They 're looking for you all over this country ! Nobody knows what happened to you or where you are and you 're sitting right here . What do you know about that ! I 'm taking you in ! p. 47 THE OUTLAW Come and get me then . HENRY You do n't think I can . THE OUTLAW Listen , Henry , I 've done this over and over for twenty years now . I know how it goes . Somebody wants to kill me so they pull a gun . They yell and scream or they sneak up from the back , it does n't much matter . It never works . I live . They , you , end up dead . I swear it 's the truth . It 's only fair to tell you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HENRY Well I know what happened at Delta , Colorado . You were holding the horses behind the bank . You heard one shot and you ran . And you 've been hiding ever since ! Boy are the boys in town gon na be happy to see you at the end of a rope ! Swing in the breeze , mister outlaw ! THE OUTLAW I do n't think I 'd take too well to jail , Henry . Just shoot me . I 'll get close enough so you do n't miss and I 'll put my gun in my hand so it looks fair and all . HENRY You never even went back to see they got buried , did you ? LILY Stop this right now ! Both of you ! THE OUTLAW ( Very firm . ) You know what to do here , Lily . Get out of the way and stand still ! HENRY Bill and Fred , remember , Archie ? Your brother Bill . His boy , Fred . You left their horses for ' em and you ran . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it was me in there ! That 's just how it worked ! HENRY They shot a man in the bank so they broke through the back door , but you were n't there . So they got on their horses and Freddie boy lit out toward Third Street on that big roan . THE OUTLAW Gelding . Suzy . HENRY You do n't know what happened , do you ? Well , how could you if you 've been hiding ever since . This is some story , Archie . Some guy Simpson shot Freddie boy right through his left ear , loaded his gun , got where he had a better aim at Bill and took the back of his head clean off . Scalped him ! THE OUTLAW You shut up ! You read about me while you got your hair cut . HENRY The shot blew Bill right out of the saddle , but Fred 's body kept riding around till somebody plugged the horse in the belly . Damn strong horse though . Made it all the way to the post office hitching post where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , squashed Fred 's body underneath , flat as flat . And where were you ? THE OUTLAW Shut up ! You just shut up ! HENRY You were riding as fast as you could . Took West Gulch to that little island in the Gunnison River , picked up your fresh horse and disappeared . Left two mighty good fresh horses behind . Did I leave anything out ? p. 49 THE OUTLAW Youoff hoping me or somebody like me would come save you from being a nobody all your life just by sticking a gun in your face . HENRY You 're a coward ! The smartest one of the bunch is nuthin ' but a miserable coward ! ARCHIE Stop it , Henry ! HENRY I just told him a little story . See , Archie , you do n't know all the stories . ( Making a lunge at the Outlaw . ) Now , you 're coming with me and  --  THE OUTLAW Do n't touch me , cowboy ! ( Henry cocks his gun again , aiming squarely at the Outlaw 's back . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Why does it have to be you ? Why could n't it be somebody I  --  HENRY What are you waiting for , coward ? THE OUTLAW You 're asking me to kill you , boy . HENRY I 'm daring you . You think you can say you 're an outlaw and that makes you an outlaw ? You ran . Real outlaws , real outlaws THE OUTLAW It went wrong for me once in my life , Henry . It ai n't gone right once for you . All you got in your life is my story to tell . p. 50 HENRY And everybody 's gon na know it was me that found you . THE OUTLAW Yeah , that 's right . You got one shot . Turn me in and get your name in the paper . HENRY And my picture with you propped up dead on the ground beside me . Change my whole life . LILY He 's warned you , Henry . This is n't a game to him ! He 'll kill you ! HENRY Yes sir . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my miserable hot life ! ARCHIE Sit down , Henry ! He wo n't shoot you if you sit down ! HENRY He do n't have to fight back . He can just stand there if he wants , but I 'm taking all that money . I 'm taking you in ! THE OUTLAW My brother dies so you can read about it in the barbershop ! ARCHIE Run , Henry ! HENRY ( Taking a step toward the Outlaw . ) Nice and easy , now , pops . Throw your gun over there . THE OUTLAW ( Standing still , his hand on his gun . ) I ca n't do that , cowboy . HENRY Then I 'm coming after it . You draw and you 're dead , mister . THE OUTLAW That 's fair . ( And instantly the Outlaw pulls his pistol , both men fire , and Henry falls dead . Lily screams. ) p. 51 ARCHIE Henry ! THE OUTLAW ( Taking a step backward . ) He was n't married , I hope . ARCHIE He was my brother ! THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! THE OUTLAW He did it himself , really . I 'm sorry . You should n't draw if you ca n't shoot . ARCHIE ( Straining against the ropes . ) Henry ! ( Lily walks over to the Outlaw . ) LILY ( In a cold fury . ) Is this what you do now ? Ride around daring people to kill you ? THE OUTLAW It 's not my fault he missed , girl . I stood still , did n't I ? LILY You are disgusting . THE OUTLAW He did n't give me a chance , honey . LILY Give me the gun . Now your knife . Nowstay put . ( She walks over to Archie . ) THE OUTLAW I 'm fine . Just a littlestiff from riding . ( Lily cuts the ropes tying Archie . Archie gets up quickly , runs to Henry and , crying , embraces him , as Lily turns to face the Outlaw. ) p. 52 LILY ( Hands the Outlaw 's knife back to him . ) Want to start carving the notch now ? THE OUTLAW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance and you know it . THE OUTLAW I tried to tell him . ARCHIE I tried to tell him . THE OUTLAW Well , then . It was a fair fight . ARCHIE ( Standing up , nearly screaming . ) Fair ? You told him he would die ! That 's not fair . Fair is when both guys got a chance . Fair is when nobody knows how it will come out ! You pulled him right in , did n't you . You dared him ! If he could kill you , then he could be somebody . THE OUTLAW Henry wanted to kill an outlaw . Ca n't kill Indians anymore . Kill an Outlaw instead . Everybody out here feels that way . Must be the water . ARCHIE What water ? ( And he stoops to pick up the gun . ) What 's the matter with this country ? This is n't what people are supposed to do ! He 's not supposed to tie me up and you 're not supposed toHe was my brother and he was no good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think that makes me feel ! THE OUTLAW You have to believe me , Lily . I 'm tired of killing these boys , but they wo n't leave me alone . p. 53 ARCHIE Henry ! Henry ! ( Lunging across the stage , Archie attacks the Outlaw in a fury of ineffective but desperate punches and kicks , which the Outlaw absorbs fairly passively . ) THE OUTLAW I 'm sorry , boy . I said I was sorry . Jesus , kid , come on . ( Archie sinks to the ground . ) THE OUTLAW It 's okay . You 're a baby . It 's all right . It 's all gon na be over in just a little bit . ARCHIE Why did you have to come here ? Nobody asked you to come here . THE OUTLAW I came to see her . ARCHIE ( Not listening to him . ) You did n't have to say anything about being an outlaw . THE OUTLAW I did n't ! You did ! She did ! He did ! ARCHIE You did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'd have given you the eggs . But no ! You sit around playing outlaw and my brother ends up dead . You could 've lied about the money . If Henry did n't know you had money in that case , he 'd have never told that Delta story and he 'd still be here ! Jesus God . Mother . What am I gon na tell Mother ? THE OUTLAW You say this old outlaw wandered into your camp , hungry . He had a sack full of money and Henry wanted it . They fought . Henry died . Simple . p. 54 ARCHIE Simple ? Who 's gon na believe an old outlaw came here . All the outlaws died . THE OUTLAW I wish . ARCHIE Just tell me your name . I have to have something to tell . Just sit down and tell me your name and then you and her can ride off . THE OUTLAW I 'm Tom McCarty . ARCHIE That 's who you said you killed . THE OUTLAW That 's right . ARCHIE You killed yourself ? THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fred and I was the only one left . I gave it up . Disappeared . LILY So why did n't you come to me then ? THE OUTLAW Because you 're exactly where they thought I 'd go . I could n't put you in that kind of danger and you know it ! I had to hide and I did . And then it got harder and harder to show back up , that 's all . ARCHIE Is there money in that case ? THE OUTLAW Forty , fifty thousand . Hard to spend that kind of money out here without attracting attention . ARCHIE So give it back . THE OUTLAW I do n't know whose it is. p. 55 ARCHIE You know what bank you got it from . THE OUTLAW Banks . Trains . It 's a problem . ARCHIE What were you doing stealing it if you did n't really want it ? What did you think you were going to do with it ? You are one sorry outlaw , mister . THE OUTLAW I need a place to sleep , Lily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . I 'll give it to Dad , for Henry . THE OUTLAW It wo n't help . His son is dead . ( Now trying to be lighter . ) But I got ta admit . " Henry 's dead , here 's forty thousand dollars , " sounds a helluva lot better than just plain , " Henry 's dead . " ( They do not laugh . ) THE OUTLAW I should 've got it in the back . Gunned down on Main Street . But no . I was so smart . I got away . ARCHIE I do n't want to hear it . LILY ( To Archie . ) What are you going to do about Henry ? His body . ARCHIE We 'll bury him . There 's three barrels . We 'll put him in the barrels and bury him . LILY But your mother . Wo n't she want a funeral ? What about the family ? Your father wo n't want to see you without Henry , I bet . p. 56 ARCHIE Well , he 's not out here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You want me to watch him be dead till morning ? Then what do I do ? Carry him home in a sack ? It 's three days . He 'd smell . I 'd have to tie him on the horse . He 'd fall off . I 'd get off , tie him back up , ride on a little bit , he 'd fall off again . Three days ? No . We 'll bury him . ( To the Outlaw . ) But you 're gon na dig this grave , " outlaw . " THE OUTLAW ( Fiercely . ) I never dug a grave in my life ! ( Sees Lily 's commanding look . ) But I do n't have to go just yet . I could help , I guess . ARCHIE You 're not going to help . You 're going to do it . THE OUTLAW ( Still looking at Lily . ) That 's what I said . LILY That 's what I thought you said . THE OUTLAW ( After a moment . ) Good . Ready . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll do . Dig it as deep as you want , you just tell me . Yes sir . You got a shovel ? ARCHIE ( Fairly disgusted now . ) Around back there . THE OUTLAW ( To Lily . ) You just watch and see , girl . Be the nicest grave you ever saw . Real comfortable . Be everything a man could want . p. 57 LILY I 'll make us some coffee . THE OUTLAW That 's a good idea too . Everybody 's just full of good ideas . ( They stand there . ) ARCHIE I hate this place . Nobody acts right out here . ( And then aware that they are staring at him . ) Shut up , Archie . THE OUTLAW That 's the spirit . ( Wanting to get on with it . ) Okay . One grave , comin ' up ( And the Outlaw heads around the side of the cookshack and Lily starts up the steps into the cookshack and the lights come down. ) @x Lights come up as the Outlaw is shoveling the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave . Archie sits back quite disturbed but not saying anything . The Outlaw seems invigorated by his physical labor . THE OUTLAW ( Resting on the shovel . ) There . All done . Rest in peace . ( To Archie . ) Want a cross or anything ? Marker ? ( No response . ) THE OUTLAW I could make one outta  --  LILY Tell him what you want , Archie . Do you want a marker ? ARCHIE No . Just be in the way . The boys , coming back in the morning , still drunk , they 'd trip over it . ( His anger building . ) It 's in the wrong place anyway . You dug the grave in the wrong place . This is right where we sit down to eat . THE OUTLAW Why did n't you say that before ? ARCHIE I did n't want you to stop digging . THE OUTLAW I 'll do another one if you want . Just getting used to the shovel , really . How about over there ? ARCHIE I want a funeral . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral . If you 'd wanted a funeral , you should 've taken him home . p. 59 THE OUTLAW ( Still so cooperative . ) I 'll dig him back up . ARCHIE ( To Lily . ) We 're having a funeral . I 'm the family . He 's the preacher . THE OUTLAW I killed him . I ca n't preach over him too . Would n't be right . ARCHIE If we were doing what was right around here , you 'd be locked up by now . You dug the grave and now you 're gon na preach the funeral . And then you 're gon na get the hell out of here and you 're gon na take her with you . THE OUTLAW No sir . LILY You 're preaching the funeral all right , but I 'm not going with you when you 're through . THE OUTLAW Yes you are too , girl . That 's what I came for . LILY Why did n't you say that right off ? We could be in my bed by now . Asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Wild West Show . THE OUTLAW What did you think I wanted if I did n't want you ? LILY I have my own life now , Tom . And if I had any thoughts about going with you , which I might have had , seeing you early on tonight , I 've sure forgot ' em all now , after what you did . Now , you owe this boy a funeral and I 'm staying just long enough to see that he gets it and then I 'm getting in my car and going back to town and tell the sheriff you 're out here , in case he 's interested . You 're dangerous . And , I might have been in love with you once , but nowI 'm a good citizen . p. 60 THE OUTLAW Well why did you come out here , then ? LILY I did n't believe you were still alive . THE OUTLAW ( Furious and hurt . ) And that 's the only reason you came all the way out here ? You were curious ? You just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . Well I sure hope you 're satisfied , girl . Contrary to popular opinion and in spite of everything I 've tried , I am still alive . ( Quickly to Archie . ) All right . What do I say ? ARCHIE You 're the preacher . THE OUTLAW ( His anger taking another direction . ) We had a good time together , in case you forgot . LILY I remember . THE OUTLAW I 'm the only man man enough for you , girl . I 'm exactly what you need . LILY I needa whole night 's sleep and a hot bath and a month 's vacation some-place green and a glass of gin , a couple more bartenders and running water , but I do n't need you . And I do n't know who does . You were mighty entertaining all those years ago , but we 've got traveling comedians now and a circus once a year and I guess Pancho Villa could probably use a broken-down gunslinger , but other than that I just do n't know . You even look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took my time getting back here , I 'll grant you that . But I 've seen these new people . ( Looking directly at Archie . ) There 's nothing to ' em . All talk . ARCHIE ( Has heard enough . ) We 're having a goddamn funeral . Now will you get on with it ! Preach ! LILY Watch your language , Archie . THE OUTLAW I wish it was me there instead of him . ARCHIE That ai n't what I had in mind . THE OUTLAW It 's the truth . ARCHIE You start out , " Family and friends " THE OUTLAW ( Stalling . ) If he 'd killed me , would you make him preach over me ? ARCHIE Henry ? He 'd have drug your body into town to have its picture took by now . THE OUTLAW Well , if you 're gon na take a picture , it 's good to do it quick . ARCHIE Will you get on with this ! I 'm managin ' to stay calm right now , but I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OUTLAW If you think you might get really mad , I 'll wait . ARCHIE So you can kill me too ? Uh-uh . Preach or go . p. 62 THE OUTLAW ( Looking at Lily , hoping to see her change her mind as he preaches . ) I 'll preach . ( To Lily . ) You sing . ( She starts to hum . ) THE OUTLAW Friends and family . Here lies Henry ( He looks to Archie . ) Middle name ? ARCHIE Jackson . THE OUTLAW Tucker . Born ? ARCHIE 1884 , Thomas , Oklahoma . THE OUTLAW Moved to ARCHIE Clovis when he was twelve . Lived there ever since . THE OUTLAW He just had a short time on this earth , but he spent it , well , to tell the truth , he pretty much wasted it . ARCHIE ( Objecting . ) Hey ! THE OUTLAW But it was his time . And if he wanted to waste it , well that was his business . His business was ( He looks to Archie. ) ranchin ' ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real good at the stuff you had to be a real sunuvabitch to do . Lie , cheat , steal . ARCHIE Go on . You 're doing just fine . p. 63 THE OUTLAW He was bored so he read outlaw books . And he hated himself , but he took it out on everybody else . Now he 's dead . Leavin ' behind a mother and father ? ( Archie nods yes . ) THE OUTLAW Some brothers and some other family , I guess and maybe some children , who knows ? They might miss him , but I would n't know why . So , rest in peace , Henry Tucker . The rest of us sure will now that you 're gone , so you might as well . You did n't have much love for this brother of yours , Archie , but he done more for you than you would have for him had I killed him instead of you and I want you to take note of that . ( Bitter , personal . ) You did n't have to die , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't listen . Well , you were gon na die anyway , we all are , someday . But you were lucky . You had help . Unlike me . Yes sir , Henry Tucker , things are pretty bad when you ca n't count on somebody else to kill you . Dyin ' just ai n't something you should have to do for yourself . ARCHIE You 're gettin ' off the track here . THE OUTLAW Okay . Heaven and hell . I 've got some bad news for you , Henry . But you might as well hear it right now , ' cause you 're gon na be findin ' it out for yourself pretty soon . I 've been thinking about heaven and hell a lot here lately , like how they decide where to put you , and I think what it is , is that they put you in a big room forever with people exactly like you , how you were in life , I mean . And that 's what makes it heaven or hell . Now you , you hated yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hell . You 'll be in with a whole bunch of ranch hands that never amounted to nuthin ' and died mad . p. 64 ARCHIE I got something to say . I didn'twe did n't get along , you and me , Henry , but you 're my brother and I respect that . Rest in peace . ( Goes on , knowing they expect more from him . ) Lotta times I thought I was ready to kill you , Henry , and I know you really did try to drown me at least twice , so no , I did n't care much for you , but I sure did n't like seein ' you die . Tell you what , Henry , the story I 'm gon na tell about how you died , it 's gon na be some story when I get through with it . If you 're ever listening , you 're gon na be real proud . I think that 's about all I can do for you now . ( To the Outlaw . ) Now , finish up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's it . I did n't know him . ARCHIE We need something from the Bible . LILY " Man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble . " THE OUTLAW God that 's gloomy . Where 'd you pick that up ? LILY At my rancher 's funeral . You 've never read the Bible in your life . What do you know ? ARCHIE " The Lord is my shepherd , I shall not want . " THE OUTLAW Are we through now ? I ai n't prayin ' to no sheepherder. p. 65 ARCHIE " For yea , though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil , for thou art with me . Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies , my cup runneth over . " ARCHIE AND LILY " Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever . " THE OUTLAW Dust to dust , an eye for a tooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Say you feel bad . Say you 're sorry . THE OUTLAW I am sorry . I do n't know anything to say . I 'm lonelier than I thought . ARCHIE Pray . THE OUTLAW I do n't know how . ARCHIE Well , what do you want said at your funeral ? Say that . THE OUTLAW What do I want said at my funeral ? How ' bout , " Okay boys , reload ! " LILY I do n't believe this ! You 're not a bit sorry about this . This is just one more dumb boy that missed . What did I ever see in you ? This is not a joke , here . This is a dead boy in the ground . Oh I wasted so much time waiting for you . Well no more ! This is the end . I am free of you for good and praise the Lord for it . p. 66 THE OUTLAW I am sorry . ( Louder . ) I 'm sorry , Henry . ( Genuine . ) I really am sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Getting crazed . ) I 'm sorry . ( Reaching quickly into his pocket . ) Okay . I 'll show you , Henry Tucker . ( Swallowing the stuff he took from his pocket . ) That 's how sorry I am . LILY What was that ? THE OUTLAW I sure am sorry . I 'm also jealous . You got something I want , Henry , so I 'm comin ' after you . Archie figured out what to do with you and I trust him to figure out what to do with me . It 's not in your honor , Henry , it 's just that now that you 're gone , it feels like family and a man should die at home . ( To Lily and Archie . ) There ! How 's that for sorry ! That was morphine . I 've killed myself ! ARCHIE ( Contemptuous . ) Well , that really is sorry . LILY Anything for a little excitement , huh Tom ? ARCHIE Yeah , how do we know it was morphine ? THE OUTLAW You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sit down . Who is the sheriff now anyway ? LILY Nobody you 'd know . Kid from St. Louis . Do n't worry about him . He thinks you 're dead . p. 67 THE OUTLAW I was n't worried . What ever happened to Daisy ? LILY ( Lunging at him . ) Throw it up ! You 're going to throw it up ! ( He fights her as she 's trying to get her finger down his throat . ) LILY Go ahead , bite me ! Vomit ! You ca n't do this ! ARCHIE So this is an outlaw . This is how outlaws die . THE OUTLAW ( Breaking away from Lily . ) Nobody knows how to die , boy . LILY How much did you take ? THE OUTLAW ( Pacing , raging . ) Nobody knows how to shoot anymore either ! You 'd think just one of these lousy cowboys could ( Then like a drunken comrade . ) See , Archie , the problem with hiding is there 's nothing to do . ( Then back to Lily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a little late for that , Tom . THE OUTLAW After I go here , Archie , shoot me . Just once . Do n't overdo it . And turn me in . There 's got ta still be a reward out somewhere . Buy yourselfsomethingBuick , something . ( Getting angry now. ) p. 68 LILY ( Pacing . ) How many times did I get asked to get married ? Only once . And you heard about that and came chasing across the country to shoot him . Then did you ask me to marry you ? Or come with you even ? No ! You take off and I do n't see you for another ten years . That rancher was rich ! THE OUTLAW You got rich on your own , girl . LILY ( Angry . ) Yes I did . THE OUTLAW See ? Say thank you . ARCHIE I 'd leave the two of you alone , but I ca n't see sitting out in the wheat all night . I 've got no place to go . THE OUTLAW I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe it . ) Did you take enough to kill you ? Goddamn you . You never even asked me to go to Bolivia with you . You just talked about it and then killed yourself ! ( The Outlaw slumps a little . ) ARCHIE Why did n't you take the morphine out in the desert ? Big bravery this is . Take it where there 's people to see you , cry over you . You make me sick ! THE OUTLAW ( Trying to defend himself . ) I went back to Hole-in-the-Wall and I did n't know anybody and there werefences , everywhere , and I could n't do it . And I 'm dying in front of Lily because I want her to have my money . Not like she needs it , of course , but well ( A silly , drugged smile on his face. ) she 's who I thought of first . It 's time for it , that 's all . p. 69 ARCHIE I should 've helped Henry shoot you . What kind of thing is this to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drug has produced . ) If you 'll just shut up , this will all be over . How am I supposed to sleep with you yelling at me ? ARCHIE ( Irritated at the outlaw 's pleasure . ) Putting on quite a show , are n't you ? Well , I do n't feel a bit sorry for you . Go ahead . Go to sleep . Things getting dark yet ? THE OUTLAW Hey , this is pretty nice , here . Just about perfect way to die , seem to me . It do n't hurtthere 's no mess to clean up . My heart 's on this side , here . Put it right here . ARCHIE ( Furious at the vanity . ) Keep your head clean for the picture ? THE OUTLAW ( To Lily , much more quiet . ) The doctor gave it to me when I broke my leg last year . He said , ( An uncomfortable laugh . ) " You take this all at once , McCarty , it 'll kill you , so go easy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I might getthe horse might fall on me sometime out where ( Beginning to have trouble talking now. ) where I could n't get tonobody around to help me and might not want tocould n't just wait for itor if you did n't want mewere n't around ( The Outlaw drifts off here for a moment , his speech getting very slurred . There is a sudden , awesome quiet and they both know he has really taken the morphine  --  something about the way his body looks leaning against the cookshack . Lily backs away and Archie seems hypnotized by the sight of him . Lily finally turns to Archie . There is no pleading , there is simply a decision to be made . Archie looks at her , then back at the Outlaw , and then to Henry 's grave. ) p. 70 ARCHIE Salt water will do it . If we can get it down him . ( Starting for the Outlaw . ) Well go on ! It 's inside somewhere . ( Lily rushes for the cookshack . Archie grabs the Outlaw and jerks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ! THE OUTLAW ( Jolted awake . ) You do n't have to squeeze . I 'm not going anywhere . ARCHIE What am I doing ? THE OUTLAW I was about to ask you that . ARCHIE ( Yelling to Lily . ) He killed my brother . I ca n't save his life ! LILY ( Yelling back . ) Where 's the water ? ARCHIE Oh , hell , it 's out here . LILY ( Rushing out . ) Where ? ARCHIE On the ground . All we had was in the barrels . Take too long to draw another bucket . Get some vinegar . LILY And salt ? It 'll kill him ! THE OUTLAW Bring it on . ARCHIE Get it . ( Lily goes back inside. ) p. 71 THE OUTLAW Dark . Things are dark . ARCHIE It 's night . Things are dark at night . THE OUTLAW My feet feel real heavy . ARCHIE Your boots are heavy . Your feet are in your boots . Your feet only feel heavy . THE OUTLAW That 's what I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you doing in there ? Come on ! LILY ( Coming out with the salt and a big unmarked can . ) It 's dark in there . This is something sloshy , but I do n't know what . Could be cherries or beansGot an opener ? THE OUTLAW If I wanted my life saved , I picked the wrong crew . ARCHIE On the wall over the stove . LILY I looked already . You go . ARCHIE ( Handing the Outlaw over to her . ) Jesus God ! ( Rushing for the cookshack . ) LILY You cold ? THE OUTLAW Yeah . You know what happened to my coat ? LILY I loved that coat . p. 72 THE OUTLAW Dirty little Navaho took it . Stole it . Stole my coat . Little boy LILY ( To Archie . ) Hurry up in there ! ARCHIE ( Running out , having opened the can . ) Coming . Hold his head back . Come on , Tom . Open up now , drink this . LILY What is it ? ( The Outlaw swallows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LILY Ahtomatoes . ARCHIE Once more , Tom . You did just fine . ( Archie forces more down the Outlaw 's throat with the same result . ) ARCHIE I just had a bath , too . THE OUTLAW Tastemouth ( As he tries to reach in his pocket . ) Get ARCHIE I 'll get it . What am I looking for ? THE OUTLAW Mint . ARCHIE ( Looking at Lily . ) Women really like this mint smell , huh ? ( Finding some , putting it in the Outlaw 's mouth . ) THE OUTLAW I like it . ( Then he chokes again. ) p. 73 ARCHIE We have to walk around . Keep him moving . We ca n't let him sit anymore . ( Puts the Outlaw over his shoulder . ) You 're gon na talk , you . You 're gon na tell me your whole life story . Now , where were you born ? Got any children ? What color hair did your mother have ? THE OUTLAW I 'm all right . Justlatetired ARCHIE ( Slaps him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't keep moving . Kick your leg . Here ! ( Kicks it for him . ) Kick . Kick . ( Archie feet get tangled in the Outlaw 's feet and they both fall . ) ARCHIE Oh God . ( Trying to get a rise out of him . ) They 'll write about this . You killing yourself . How 's that going to sound ? Last Outlaw Kills Self . THE OUTLAW Bad . Sound badLily LILY Look at me , Tom . THE OUTLAW Pretty . LILY We can save you if you 'll help us . You threw some up but there 's still plenty left in you . You have to keep moving . Stay awake . ARCHIE Do you want us to save you ? We have to know right now . THE OUTLAW I do n't want to die . Do n't let me die p. 74 ARCHIE ( Again trying to force him to talk . ) Why not ? Why should n't we let you die ? You killed my brother and who knows who else ? You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Die or not . THE OUTLAW Not . Not . Archie . Please . Lily ARCHIE ( Pulling Lily away from him . ) Prove it . Stand up . Stand up and we 'll save you . Why do you want to live ? You did n't a few minutes ago , and things have n't changed all that much . THE OUTLAW ( Trying to talk . ) Pretty . ARCHIE Pretty ! That 's why you want to live ? Because she 's pretty ? THE OUTLAW ( Making it , standing up . ) Up . Live . ( And immediately , be falls back into Archie 's arms . ) ARCHIE She 's a whole lot better than pretty . Walk . Walk . LILY Give me his other arm . ( They shoulder the Outlaw between them . ) ARCHIE ( After a moment . ) You cold ? LILY Freezing . ARCHIE I do n't know what I can do . I 'd get you a coat but he 'd fall . ( She nods ) p. 75 ARCHIE I know . Take his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some . ( They struggle to take his jacket off as they continue to talk . ) ARCHIE That 'd be good . We save him and you die of pneumonia . LILY You 're cold too . ARCHIE Yep . Sure am . And so is Henry . That makes four of us . All cold . ( And he has awkward boyish awareness that now the two of them have to talk for what might be hours . ) LILY ArchieI 'm sorry about Henry . ARCHIE ( Not wanting to talk abut it , starts to walk the Qutlaw around again . ) Henry used to make Mother so mad . We 'd be in church and Henry and some of his buddies would sneak up to the wagons parked out front . There 'd be babies or little kids sleeping in the wagons and they 'd switch the babies . People got home and found they had the right blanket with the wrong baby in it . LILY Is that how you got in your family in the first place ? ARCHIE ( Surprised that she guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too when he 's mad at me . Which is always . I do n't mind , really . You got ta have a mean streak like you got ta have a mule out here . p. 76 LILY You do n't have that mean streak , Archie . ARCHIE ( Does n't want to talk about that either . ) Dad wanted an orchard like we had back in Oklahoma . But the ground was so hard , we had to put dynamite in each hole to shake the dirt loose so the roots could take hold . Dad made me haul water on a sled for two years to keep those peach trees alive . LILY Did they make it ? ARCHIE No . He 's mostly raising cattle now . He 's got this fool idea that the government 's gon na need mules for the war , so he 's just bought fifteen wild mares to start breedin ' ' em . LILY There could be money in that . ARCHIE Hell , the war 's gon na be over before the mules are old enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Archie , find a place that suits you better . What are you waiting for ? ARCHIE I ca n't leave , Lily , I was born here . Did Tom really shoot your husband ? LILY We 're all at the church . Saloon 's even closed for the event . Roy Luther , tending bar , said he would n't believe I 'd get married unless he saw it himself . Tom came in late . Sat at the back . Nobody saw him . ARCHIE But when the preacher said , " Anybody got any reason why I should n't marry these two , " Tom stepped out in the aisle , said " Draw mister , " and shot him . p. 77 LILY Actually no , the rancher shot first , but Tom is quick , you know . ARCHIE I know . LILY He came by later . Said he rode three straight days to get there . Said they 'd be after him so he had to go . ARCHIE Got on his horse and rode off . LILY Well , not right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't send a posse , after all . People knew the rancher was about to buy a herd of sheep and it got to be a joke . Roy Luther said I really did know how to take care of a sheepherder , all right . The town painted my house for me , to say thanks . ( A pause ) I thought Tom was dead . The man just disappears . ARCHIE But he wants people to know him . LILY Well , he does n't want to be forgotten , that 's true . But he does n't want to be recognized and shot either . ARCHIE What he wants is you . LILY ( Quickly . ) He wants it to be like it was . Every sheriff in  --  ( The Outlaw stirs at the word " sheriff " He stands on his own , ready to fight , then breaks away from , them , charging around . ) THE OUTLAW Sheriff ! God , it 's Hazen ! I can smell him he 's so close ! ( Crouching as if in battle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . ) There 's no way out ! There must be twenty ! THE OUTLAW ( Now creeping around as if behind rocks . ) Keep firing one at a timeslip through . Take Teapot north . ( Now slumping as quickly as he awoke before . ) Brakemanshoulda killed the brakeman . LILY ( Slapping him . ) Tom ! Tom ! ( But he does n't recover . ) That 's how we have to do it ! Who else is there ? ( Then quickly , yelling at the Outlaw . ) Jim Averill ! It 's Cattle Kate ! We got a mess comin ' , honey ! THE OUTLAW ( Charging around again , firing his gun . ) The Regulators ! Is it the Regulators ? ARCHIE ( Wanting to help . ) It 's the Regulators ! THE OUTLAW You 're not taking me , Robert Connor . I got you , Bothwell ! ( The Outlaw grabs Archie as if to strangle him , then collapses and they both fall . Archie pulls the Outlaw up to sit on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archie massages the Outlaw 's face and neck , trying to think of some way to continue the conversation with Lily , as she is momentarily out of breath. ) p. 79 ARCHIE So . Were you really a whore or not ? LILY ( Quite annoyed . ) What difference does it make ? You would n't be helping me if I were ? ARCHIE No , I just meant , well , you do n't seem like , you know LILY No , I do n't know . ARCHIE If you were a whore , then LILY You might be wrong about whores , huh ? You might be in big trouble if you had the money ? ARCHIE ( Eager to change the subject . ) Tom ! Hey Tom ! ( Then to Lily . ) Come on . All I know is Remember the Alamo . LILY Frank Canton ! THE OUTLAW ( Jerking up instantly . ) Kill Frank Canton ! Come out here , Frank Canton ! ARCHIE ( Yelling . ) They got him , McCarty ! THE OUTLAW Got who ? ARCHIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Nate ? They got Nate ? ARCHIE ( Attempting to revive him . ) It was Nate all right ! p. 80 THE OUTLAW ( Reviving . ) Light those fires , Brown . Burn ' em to kingdom come ! ( Then the Outlaw falls unconscious . Archie knows by now not to let him charge off by himself in these moments of being awake . As a result , Archie is dragged around the stage , as the Outlaw relives his past . Archie and Lily put him between them and begin to walk again . ) ARCHIE ( Trying to talk to Lily again , this time more carefully . ) Were you born out here ? LILY I do n't talk about my life . It sounds like one of those books . ARCHIE I got it . Your family came out here homesteading and they got wiped out in a drought and your mother died having a baby so your daddy left to join up with the Mexican army , leaving you in the house alone . Some preacher 's wife took you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barn raisin ' . They left you everything they had , which was two oil lamps and a Bible , so you moved to the city and gotwork . LILY ( Has to laugh . ) Very good . You 've been reading the books . ( Archie is pleased . ) LILY Your mother isuha little fat lady who wears her hair in braids wrapped around her head and sits out on the stoop at night to wash her feet before she goes to bed . p. 81 ARCHIE That 's her all right . When I think about her , away from home like this , all I see is a big white apron . She pays me ten cents for every turkey nest I find . Turkeys hide their nests , you know . LILY ( Distracted . ) No . I did n't know . ( Yelling again . ) Hainer 's gon na give himself up ! THE OUTLAW ( Charging out of his unconsciousness . ) Claverly , you lay one hand on meI 'll kill you . I 'll give you all six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapsing again . ) LILY ( Defeated , worried . ) Why did he do this ? How are we supposed to go on ? I ca n't do this all night . I do n't know any more names . Why , Tom ? ARCHIE But where did you get the money for the hotel ? LILY ( Suddenly depressed and bitter . ) It 's none of your damn business . ARCHIE I know what you did ! It was a big ranch . You sold it ! LILY And everything on it ! Kicked out the whores and turned the place into a hotel . That rancher was rich . I had money left . I built a school . I named it for the rancher . Least I could do , you know . ( Irritated again . ) Do n't you even know one sheriff 's name ? One deputy ? p. 82 ARCHIE ( Stares at the Outlaw , then yells . ) Daniel Boone ! ( The Outlaw slumps even more . ) ARCHIE Sorry . LILY No . I 'm sorry . Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess . It was n't as much fun as we said it was . ARCHIE I bet you did n't get too many proposals after what Tom did . LILY ( Very hostile . ) Ca n't we talk about something else ? ARCHIE Look . I know you 're scared . But he 'll make it . You 'll see . His pulse is stronger already . Do n't you think ? LILY I do n't know how to take it . ARCHIE You just count . You remember if you 're counting faster than you did when you counted before . LILY I did n't count before . ARCHIE ( Much too cheerful for Lily . ) So you 'd count next time . I counted before . I think he just might make it . LILY And then what ? ARCHIE And then what ? LILY No , you do n't say what I said . You say something new . p. 83 ARCHIE I do n't know what to say . I do n't know what we 're talking about . LILY So what you know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LILY Ever seen a girl without any clothes on ? ARCHIE Just my little sister . LILY It 's not the same , you know . ARCHIE Yeah . It 's different . LILY Real different . So what have you been doing ? ARCHIE Do n't make fun of me . You wo n't tell me anything , so I wo n't tell you anything either . And I know a lot of good stories . I could fill up this whole night telling you my life . How I learned to rope calves or the time Bill got his hand eat by a catfish . ( Gets tickled in spite of himself at this memory . ) But I 'm not telling ! It 's private ! What do you care anyway ? LILY I have everything all set and then he just drops in and tries to kill himself . And we 're trying to save him ! And all you know is stories . Well , you 'll get a good one out of this , wo n't you ? ARCHIE Do you want him to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a damn fool carrying him around all night . He killed my brother ! p. 84 LILY That 's what we 're talking about . He 's a killer . ARCHIE I 'll drop him on the ground right now if you say to . LILY You would not either . ARCHIE Go sit then . See what happens . LILY We should turn him in . ARCHIE Let 's save his life first . LILY No . Now . While he 's asleep . Let 's put him in my car and take him into town and turn him in . ARCHIE He 'd die on the trip . If you want him to live , we have to keep walking . LILY That car is the only reason we even stayed here two minutes , is n't it ? He would n't ride in my car ! Outlaws do n't ride in cars , I guess . Well how 's he going to get around anymore ? What is he going to do if we save him ? ARCHIE What will you do if we do n't ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one good reason for saving his life ! It 's over anyway and he knows it . That 's why he pulled this stunt . ARCHIE You were his last chance , Lily . He had to take it . LILY Yours is the life worth saving here . If you leave right now , you can hop that early train . When the crew comes back tomorrow , I 'll explain everything and you 'll be on your own . p. 85 ARCHIE I could n't just disappear , Lily . LILY There 's nothing for you here except winding up like Henry . ARCHIE I 'm nothing like Henry and you know it . LILY Not now you are n't , but you wait . You 'll get his work now that he 's gone , wo n't you ? It was that work that killed him . You 'll dry up , Archie , just like he did . ARCHIE I 'll get his share of the ranch , too , if I do his work . LILY Is that what you want , Archie ? Twice as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without you . What are you so afraid of ? ARCHIE Was that story true , about Delta , Colorado ? LILY Yeah . Roy Luther told me the same thing . He ran away . Fast as he could . ARCHIE But why ? LILY To get away , Archie . To live . So he could hide . It 's not fair . I hare it . ARCHIE There 's no way you can hide out here . I stand in the middle of our land and I think the only way out is straight up . I can see for fifty miles in any direction . I mean , if I could be in two places at once , I could ride a horse for a whole day and see myself . ( Lily does n't understand. ) p. 86 ARCHIE I could see where I started from where I got to after riding all day . The only thing that ever really gets out of where we live is the train . THE OUTLAW ( Sudden , unprovoked . ) Bill ! Fred ! ( Then falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He woke up on his own that time ! LILY ( Almost tenderly . ) Whenever they were planning to rob a bank , Tom would always work a local ranch for a few months first . Get to know the town , you know . I always thought some of those ranchers missed his working their horses more than they missed their money in the bank . I guess he thought I 'd bring him some beautiful horse to ride back tonight . I justdid n't think about it . Iforgot . ARCHIE What was it like when youthe old days , with him ? LILY He 'd blow in like the breath of God , horse sleek and black , and all you 'd see was his flyin ' coat and this big hat , and he 'd make everybody else I 'd ever met look real tired . And he knew you wanted him , and you did . Soon as you saw him you had to have him . That 's still true . That 's what happened to Henry . ARCHIE He 'll make it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all you have to do is take that new picture he 's got for you and burn it . Henry was an expert and Henry would n't have recognized him if Tom had n't said Delta , Colorado , Bill and Fred . p. 87 LILY He would never let me do that , Archie . You saw how proud he was of that new picture . ARCHIE So burn it . LILY But then what do I do with him ? Drug his coffee when he gets mean ? ARCHIE He loves you . He 's old and he needs you . LILY But what about me ? I 'm not as old as he is . I 'm not through yet ! ARCHIE I do n't blame him for wanting to look at you again . LILY He could 've just asked me to send him a picture . ARCHIE No , I mean it . Your skin looks so soft . LILY And I have all the softest parts covered up . You should see them . ( She means this to sound irritated , so she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seductively . ) ARCHIE Now why did you say that ? LILY Sounds good , huh ? ARCHIE I just never heard it before , that 's all . LILY You really are a virgin , huh ? Saving yourself for some church girl could be a real mistake , Archie . ARCHIE Dad says not to worry about it . There 's nothing to it . p. 88 LILY Dadis wrong . ARCHIE ( After a moment . ) Well , if you want to tell me something I should know , you know , just one or two little things just to get me started THE OUTLAW ( Eyes opening , slowly gaining consciousness . ) Lily ? ARCHIE He 's alive ! LILY ( Smiling at Archie . ) Right here , Tom . THE OUTLAW Archie ? ARCHIE ( Really pleased . ) You bet . THE OUTLAW Henry ? ARCHIE No Henry . THE OUTLAW Oh that 's right . I 'm sorry . ARCHIE We 've been through that already . LILY Can you sit up ? ARCHIE ( Reaching in the Outlaw 's pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nice piece of mint . Gon na cut that bad taste in your mouth . Here , open up . ( Taking some for himself . ) Thanks . Do n't mind if I do . LILY I never knew how he got that mint smell . I do n't think it grows wild around here . He must have it planred somewhere . p. 89 ARCHIE From what I feel in his pocket , he could have it planted in there . ( She laughs . ) ARCHIE Tastes good . I see why he likes it . THE OUTLAW What happened ? LILY You tried to kill yourself . You took the morphine . ARCHIE You threw some of it up . That 's tomatoes there on your coat . And we walked the rest of it out of you . THE OUTLAW Why did you do that ? It would be all over by now . ARCHIE You asked us to . You said do n't let me die . THE OUTLAW Well , damn . ARCHIE We saved your life . You should say more than well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archie . You walked for me all night , and now you 're gon na talk for me all day . What do you want me to say ? ARCHIE Ask Lily to marry you . THE OUTLAW I ca n't . I do n't have any money . ARCHIE You 've got a suitcase full of money ! THE OUTLAW No . ARCHIE There 's forty-fifty thousand dollars in that case ! p. 90 THE OUTLAW I said no . Look for yourself . ( Archie goes over and opens the satchel . He bends over it , looks through several layers and closes the satchel without saying anything , but he is shocked by what he sees . ) THE OUTLAW I 'm so sleepy . ARCHIE ( Very sympathetic . ) We wore you out , I guess . Kicked you , punched you , slapped you . Fought the Pinkertons with you all night . You took a real beating all right . ( To Lily . ) Is it okay for him to sleep now ? LILY I think so . I think it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . ARCHIE You were going to ask Lily to marry you . THE OUTLAW You saved my life . I owe you something . ( To Lily . ) Lily , I 've always loved you . I 'm not much anymore . Will you have me ? Will you marry me ? LILY ( A fairly serious look . ) What do you think , Archie ? Should I marry this out law ? ARCHIE ( Beaming . ) It was my idea ! LILY I think you 're right . Yes , Tom , I 'll marry you . But it better be tomorrow or I do n't ever want to see you again . p. 91 THE OUTLAW I ca n't live in town . LILY I have a farm . There 's a house . There are horses . THE OUTLAW Good horses ? LILY Not yet . ARCHIE That 's your part . You got work to do when you wake up . THE OUTLAW Farm . ( And he drifts off into what looks like normal sleep . ) LILY We should sleep too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never saved anybody 's life before . The way I feel , I could thresh this whole field myself before they get back . LILY ( Enjoying his thrill . ) I bet you could , Archie . ARCHIE We did it ! We saved his life ! We really did it ! The fight was Henry 's fault anyway , mostly . He got to telling that story and things just got all out of hand . Tom tried to tell Henry not to come after him . Why , as far as Tom 's concerned , it was just about self-defense , do n't you think ? LILY I 'm not thinking about it . ARCHIE Saving somebody 's life ! That 's got to be the best feeling in the whole world . LILY It 's in the cop three anyway . p. 92 ARCHIE Did you see , Tom even knew my name when he woke up . He 'll have you , that farm , those horses . He 'll have a whole new life . And you , you 'll have him . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out till morning , I 'm sure . How old are you , Archie ? ARCHIE Seventeen . LILY ( Standing up . ) That 's old enough . I need a favor . ARCHIE Well you just name it ! I done all I could for both of them and they neither one deserved it probably . So you just tell me what it is and I 'll do it . LILY I want you to take me in the cookshack or wherever your bed is , someplace warm where  --  ARCHIE God , yes . You must be exhausted . LILY  --  we can lie down . I want you to take off all these hotel clothes I 've got on and I want you to make love with me . And if you 'd like to dance first , that 's all right . Or if you want to have a drink of whiskey , that 's fine too . The only thing you ca n't do is say no . Do n't say anything . ARCHIE You do n't have to thank me , if that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just let him die here . LILY ( Very firm , and very fast . ) I said you could n't say anything . You must learn to shut up , Archie , and you must nevereverassume that you know why anybody is doing anything . p. 93 ARCHIE ( Gets the message . ) I said I would do whatever you wanted and I meant that . LILY ( Now much more personal . ) I do n't know what 's going to happen in the morning . He could wake up mean and kill us both . Or he could take off for Bolivia or just disappear for another ten years . Then again , he might take you up on your offer and marry me . So , this is just a little waiting time before we know what is going to happen . It 's free clear time . We might as well be all alone in the whole world . And whatever happens in the morning , I wo n't be seeing you very often , and you are the first person I have genuinely liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat , I 'll end up helping you , and it 'll kill me . This way , unless I 've forgotten what to do , which is possible , because it 's been ten years I 've spent waiting for that man , we 're both going to feel a lot better . Now , take my head in your hands and kiss me . ( Her speech has affected a considerable change in Archie . He seems taller , more poised . ) ARCHIE ( After the kiss . ) Dancing , or drinking firstwould just waste our time , do n't you think ? LILY You 're going to do just fine . ARCHIE You are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen . p. 94 LILY You 're catching on real fast , Archie . I knew you would . ARCHIE I even have one of Mother 's quilts . LILY Sh-h-h . ( And Lily smiles and a single light remains on the sleeping Outlaw as Archie and Lily step into the cookshack . There is a change in the lighting as we go from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archie and Lily walk out of the cookshack , Archie carrying a coffeepot , Lily a skillet and some eggs . Lily has a quilt around her shoulders . ) ARCHIE I guess it would be an engineer . The railroadI do n't know , It 's important to me . I could sit there all day , swap stories with the fireman , check my pressure gauge , watch the sky cloud up , look out back at where we 've been , see our smokeChief engineer on the Overland Flyer . What a job . ( Pauses . ) Or the war could need me , I guess . ( They sit down near the fire . ) LILY The war would 've had you already if they 'd elected that Teddy Roosevelt . ARCHIE My dad says President Wilson is just plain yellow . Would n't last two weeks as sheriff of Clovis . LILY I 'd like to see New York . ARCHIE Me too . Know what they 've got there ? Crowds . ( She laughs. ) p. 95 ARCHIE I want to bump into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . I do n't know what I 'm talking about . Do you believe there 's airplanes ? LILY ( Laughs . ) Oh , Archie . This is going to make you so mad . I 've seen one ! ARCHIE You have not ! You saw a picture of one . I 've seen a picture of one . I want to see one fly over my head . Would you ride in one ? LILY Three years ago , I took the train to St. Louis . It 's as far east as I 've been . That Teddy Roosevelt was up in an airplane with somebody called the Wright Brothers Flying Team . We were all down there watching him . He was waving to us . We were waving at him . He got so excited waving he almost fell out of the plane ! Oh , it was the best day . People were standing around saying things like takeoff and air pocket . ( Her excitement is unlike anything we 've seen from her to this point . ) ARCHIE Why did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only story I know . I was saving it for you . ARCHIE It 's the best story I ever heard . LILY There are plenty more out there . All you have to do is get on the train . ARCHIE ( Defensively . ) Things happen here . Things are changing here too . I want to be here when it happens . People like me have to stay here and make it happen . p. 96 LILY When it happens here , Archie , it will be secondhand . But I 'm not going to say any more about it . You know what I think . Now , tell me how your brother got his hand eaten by the catfish . ARCHIE No , you tell me what else you saw in St. Louis . ( Before Lily can answer , the Outlaw stirs and we see that he is awake . Lily and Archie exchange pleased looks . ) ARCHIE ( Much too bright . ) Good morning ! THE OUTLAW Hold it right there ! ( The Outlaw is seriously disoriented , and at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then dives back down beside the cookshack and holds the gun on them . Archie protects Lily by moving in front of her . ) ARCHIE Easy , buddy . It 's just us THE OUTLAW Buddy ? LILY It 's all right , Tom . THE OUTLAW ( Very grumpy , stands up . ) The hell it is ! ARCHIE How do you feel ? THE OUTLAW Bad . LILY We 've got the coffee all ready . ARCHIE How about some eggs ? p. 97 THE OUTLAW ( He grabs his satchel . ) I got ta get out of here . LILY We can have some coffee first . And I 'm hungry . THE OUTLAW Good-bye , Lily . Boy . ARCHIE Now , you wait a minute . We walked you around for hours , just the two of us , and it was cold out here and you 're heavy , mister . We saved your life last night . THE OUTLAW Yeah , and if I do n't get going , that threshing crew will come back and you 'll get another chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your brother is dead , but your crew boss is gon na care that he 's a man short today . I already said good-bye . That 's all you 're gon na get ! ( Turns to go . ) ARCHIE You 're on foot , remember ? ( A pause . ) Only way out of here 's in that car of hers . ( Then having a little fun . ) If you act nice , though , she might let you drive . LILY How many eggs , Tom ? THE OUTLAW Just two . LILY And bacon ? THE OUTLAW I 'd rather have peaches . Are there any peaches ? LILY ( Getting up , starting for the cookshack . ) I 'll look . Archie ? p. 98 ARCHIE I 'm not hungry . THE OUTLAW You are too . You should have some eggs . You like peaches ? ARCHIE ( Setting the frying pan on the fire . ) Okay . Same as him . ( Lily goes into the cookshack as the Outlaw sits down . ) ARCHIE They wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's Sunday . Ca n't miss church . ( The Outlaw nods . ) ARCHIE Do you remember what you said last night ? THE OUTLAW I did n't say a thing . ARCHIE You asked Lily to marry you . She said yes . THE OUTLAW Out of my head , I guess . ARCHIE ( Angry now . ) And you asked me to look in your case , there . ( This disturbs the Outlaw . ) THE OUTLAW ( Firm , hostile . ) Nobody looks in my case . ( Lily comes out with the can of peaches and some bowls , which she hands to Archie . ) LILY ( Starting to cook the eggs . ) Now , it wo n't be but just a minute . p. 99 THE OUTLAW ( Brightly . ) So , got away again , did I ? LILY You had help . THE OUTLAW I guess I should thank you . ARCHIE ( Angry . ) I wondered when you 'd get around to that . THE OUTLAW You did n't have to do it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you always know the right thing to do , boy , well you do n't . Maybe I was ready for it . Maybe if you knew about anything besides egg hunts , you 'd have let me die . I mean , what do you know about anything , Archie ? ARCHIE It was Henry told you about the egg hunts . And Henry 's dead . I know about that . LILY ( Insisting that they both calm down . ) We 'll just eat out of the skillet , here . ( She hands them each a fork and we have a moment of peace . ) THE OUTLAW ( As they begin to eat . ) I love eggs . Thing I do n't understand is how something so good can come from a chicken . A chicken ! ARCHIE ( Matter-of-fact . ) I like fried chicken . THE OUTLAW Me too . With biscuits and gravy . p. 100 LILY There are chickens on the farm . ARCHIE Her farm . Remember about her farm ? Where you 're going to live with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me nervous . Dirty animals . Should n't even be called animals . ARCHIE They 're not . They 're birds . THE OUTLAW They 're ugly . They ca n't even fly . ARCHIE They lay eggs for you . They die to make your fried chicken . THE OUTLAW I could n't live with chickens and that 's the end of it . ARCHIE Cattle ? THE OUTLAW Cattle are dumb . ARCHIE Crops ? THE OUTLAW Work . LILY Just horses then . The horses on the farm are  --  THE OUTLAW Have to be young to work horses . LILY There are young people for hire . THE OUTLAW I do n't like young people either . Jumpy . I do n't like any of it . I only like eggs . LILY No chickens . I promise . THE OUTLAW No . No nuthin ' . No marriage . No farm . No nuthin ' . ( And there is a terrible pause , while everybody understands what has just been said. ) p. 101 ARCHIE You are so dumb . Nobody cares about outlaws anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was your last real admirer and you shot him . LILY ( Trying to be calm . ) How are we going to wash these dishes ? ARCHIE ( Bitter , hostile . ) Leave ' em . They 'll figure it out ! A new grave and dirty dishes . Somebody came in here , killed Henry and ate breakfast . THE OUTLAW They 're gon na think you killed him ! How about that ! After we leave , there 's gon na be one gun with one shot fired and one dead man with one bullet in himand you . Dammit all , you 're gon na get the credit for my good shot . ARCHIE You killed my brother and I saved your life ! THE OUTLAW And I would n't tell anybody if I were you . ARCHIE ( Defensive . ) They 'll understand . It was the exact right thing to do . THE OUTLAW It 's as wrong as it can be , boy . It 's one of your new ideas and it 's nothin ' but trouble . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OUTLAW If you had an inch of guts you 'd kill me back , and that 's what they 're all gon na say , the crew , your dad , all of ' em ! Are n't they . I can hear ' em now . " So what 'd you do , Archie ? " You did what , Archie ? " That 's exactly what they 'll say . Is n't it ! p. 102 ARCHIE I do n't know what they 'll say . THE OUTLAW You do too . It 's exactly what they 'll say ! ARCHIE What if it is ? That does n't make it right . It only means they 're as backward as you and Henry . THE OUTLAW No , boy . You should 've shot me . You have to kill ' em while you got the chance , or else you 'll just have to fight ' em again some other day . ARCHIE Well I do n't believe that . THE OUTLAW Well I 'm glad I 'm not gon na be there for the future then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . This is how things arehere . ARCHIE ( Very strong . ) Werehere . THE OUTLAW ( Stronger still . ) Are ! Everywhere ! ARCHIE No ! Not anymore . Not everywhere ! No ! Just out here in this damn scrub country . We 're so far away from everything , everybody acts like there 's no rules at all and anybody can just do whatever they like  --  well they ca n't . Or if they can , I do n't have to sit here and watch them , not anymore . I 've got my own ideas about how people should live and this ai n't it . No sir . THE OUTLAW I shot the wrong boy all right . You 're scared . p. 103 ARCHIE ( Rejecting both ideas out of hand , suddenly seems very alert , self-possessed , proud . ) I am not . I 've got a better idea . ( Picks up the Outlaw 's satchel . ) THE OUTLAW That 's mine . ARCHIE ( Triumphant , taking charge . ) I 'm going to burn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that down ! They 're all I 've got ! ARCHIE She 's all you 've got but you do n't know it . Once they 're gone , you 'll have a chance of finding that out . THE OUTLAW ( Pulls his gun . ) You give them to me ! ( Archie pulls a wanted poster out of the satchel and crumples it up . ) ARCHIE You 'll have to kill me for them . I do n't think you will . Would n't be fair . Actually I like that about you . That and the mint . ( Throwing the poster in the fire . ) THE OUTLAW ( Archie is right , puts the gun away . ) It wo n't make any difference . They 'll still know who I am . ARCHIE Good then . I have your permission . ( Archie upends the satchel , dumping all the newspaper articles , wanted posters and other bits of evidence of the Outlaw 's exploits on the fire. ) p. 104 ARCHIE ( Very formal . ) All the outlaws are dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LILY And the only picture we have of him is twenty years old , so who is this old-timer we got here ? ARCHIE ( Now much more personal . ) You ca n't just keep riding around . She loves you . You can forget everything that 's happened and start all over . THE OUTLAW If I forget everything that 's happened , then what do I have that she would want , boy ? ARCHIE How should I know ? But she said she would marry you so there must be something . THE OUTLAW ( To Lily . ) Look , I was pretty groggy last night . I do n't remember any of this . LILY That 's what I said all right . THE OUTLAW Boy I sure do n't know why . ARCHIE Maybe she likes your talk . ( Pauses a moment . ) Come on . Do you ever know why anybody does anything ? LILY I also said it better be today or I never want to see you again . ( And there is another pause but this one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it. ) p. 105 THE OUTLAW ( Looking at Lily , but talking to Archie . ) Go ahead . Burn the satchel too , why do n't you ? ARCHIE ( Holding it out to him . ) That 'd be wasteful . Nice case . THE OUTLAW ( Looks at Lily , then at Archie . ) Keep it . ARCHIE ( Dusting it off ; looking at it . ) Thanks . I will . I 'm gon na need something like this . ( To Lily . ) Do me a favor . LILY I owe you one . ARCHIE Write to my mother . It 's Olivia Tucker , Clovis . Tell her to take care of herself . Tell her  --  LILY  --  You did what you could . You 'll write when you can . ARCHIE Yeah . Thanks . THE OUTLAW Running away , huh , Archie ? They 'll know you did it for sure now . Gon na go east ? Where they do things civilized ? ARCHIE I do n't know where I 'm going . I 'm just getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some town that makes some sense . THE OUTLAW Go east . You 'll fit right in . ARCHIE Prissy little boy like me. p. 106 THE OUTLAW Exactly . ( And Archie heads for the cookshack to gather up his things . ) ARCHIE ( As he steps up into the cookshack . ) He needs a bath . THE OUTLAW The hell I do ! LILY I 'll see that he gets it . ( As Archie is inside the cookshack , she and the Outlaw try to talk again . ) LILY It was the car , was n't it . If I had come on a horse , none of this would have happened . You just did n't want to ride away in an automobile . THE OUTLAW Just seemed awful fancy , that 's all . LILY That did n't used to be a problem for you . THE OUTLAW I liked a fancy girl , all right . I sure did . LILY Well , then THE OUTLAW I 'm gon na need a new coat . Long , gold color . LILY I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there a moment , just looking at her . ) THE OUTLAW Now just how , exactly , are you gon na " see " that I get my bath ? LILY Oh I 'll draw the water , hand you the brush , get myself a beer , pull up a chair and watch . You remember . p. 107 THE OUTLAW Yeah , it 's all comin ' back to me now . LILY But we 'll have to call you something else in town . Tom McCarty is dead . THE OUTLAW It wo n't work . Roy Luther will know it 's me . LILY He 'll call you whatever you want . He 'll call you Clara Mae if you buy him a beer . THE OUTLAW I could be Doc . How about Doc . I was courtin ' a Doc 's daughter so they called me Doc . It 's a joke . LILY Doc is good . THE OUTLAW Doc it is . ( And now Archie comes out of the cookshack carrying his things , one of which must be his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to him , kissing him . ) Good-bye , Archie . ARCHIE I 'll send you picture postcards , so do n't sell the hotel or move or anything . LILY Send me one from France . ARCHIE From the war if I get there . LILY From France . From New York . From France . ARCHIE ( As the Outlaw takes her arm . ) You bet I will . Good-bye , Lily . p. 108 THE OUTLAW Come on , girl . ( Practically dragging her now . ) A war is just what you need , runt . ARCHIE The name 's Archie . THE OUTLAW That 's a runt name , for sure . Come on , girl . ( Walks offstage . ) LILY ( Backing away toward the Outlaw . ) Goodness and mercy . ARCHIE Huh ? LILY ( A blessing. ) follow you all the days of your life . ARCHIE ( Affectionately . ) Oh yeah . What do you think the chances of that are ? LILY I do n't know . Fair . ARCHIE Good-bye , Lily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Let 's get out of here . They could be back anytime . It 's almost noon . ( Archie watches her go , then walks up to Henry 's grave and takes a look around the camp area . Finally , he seems ready to go . ) ARCHIE Jesus God in heaven , it 's Archie Tucker from Clovis , New Mexico . And I know you can see me , so you must 've seen everything that went on down here tonight and listen , I want to know ( Very flip and irritated . ) Was this all your idea ? ( Pauses . ) Because if it wasgo work on somebody else for a while . I 've got things to do . ( Starts to walk off , then stops when he hears Lily 's voice. ) p. 109 LILY Well , what are you waiting for ? Get in . The handle 's right there on the door . THE OUTLAW Just getting the feel of her , that 's all . Real smooth , is n't she . LILY Real shiny too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( And as we hear the car doors slam , Archie has something else to say to God . ) ARCHIE Well , okay . I do appreciate what you did for me with that coyote back on the road there , so I 'm grateful . Thank you . I mean , I do want to stay in touch . ( Archie pauses , knowing he wo n't be in touch as often as he has been in the past , but excited about what lies ahead for him . We hear the cars engine start , then drive off . ) ARCHIE Tell you what . First time I get up in one of those airplanes . You keep your eye on ol ' Archie Tucker . I 'll ( Raises his hand in a fond salute and smiles. ) wave to you . ( The lights , which by now are down to a single light on Archie 's face , black out , as the sound of a train whistle and the faint strains of some World War . I song end the play. )  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
