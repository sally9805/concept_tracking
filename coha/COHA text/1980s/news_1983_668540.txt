Just want to let you know that the fact that the Celtics are far , far away , doesn ' t mean I haven ' t been thinking about them . Therefore , may I share a few exhibition-season thoughts with you ? Item - Robert Parish stages a work stoppage . I see an endless landscape of gray here , and I can not comprehend the moralizing taking place on the part of many members of the media . I agree that any big-name , big-money player who signs a contract in these volcanic economic times must understand the No. 1 rule of the game : He Who Signs Last Signs Biggest . However , I draw a distinction between what I shall term Outside Forces ( i.e. , what another team does for its personnel ) and what I shall refer to as Internal Insults ( i.e. , what a team does for a teammate ) . If Robert Parish signs a nice contract with the Celtics , and Ted Stepien promptly pays a journeyman such as James Edwards more than Parish , that ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s tough luck . But if Robert Parish signs a nice contract with the Celtics and the Celtics go on to pay Kevin McHale substantially more money , Robert has a legitimate moral grievance . I assumed from the minute I heard about McHale ' s new contract that the Celtics would come to Parish for a significant " contract adjustment . " They had to be ready for a beef if they had an iota of common sense . The thing worrying me is this : Do the Celtics believe they need McHale more than Parish ? If so , I find their reasoning dubious . My sympathy for Parish is limited , however . His refusal to suit up at the current time is a cheap stunt . He had all summer to confront the team . Item - The Celtics have four guards who merit a considerable amount of playing time . Four is one too many . That ' s my belief , anyway . Hey , Red Auerbach wrote the book on a solid regular eight , plus role players . One of the big problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would do what , and for how long . The ideal backcourt situation in the NBA is to have a clear starting pair of guards , a third guard who ( theoretically ) can play either guard spot and a fourth guard who has a specialty . Look no further than Philadelphia , where Andrew Toney and Maurice Cheeks are backed by Clint Richardson and Franklin Edwards , the latter being a shooting machine . A third guard is one thing ; a fourth guard is something else entirely . There is only one certainty about the Celtics ' backcourt situation . They have a computerized third guard , and his name is Gerald Henderson . This is why he was put on this earth . So K.C. should start with that premise . Red isn ' t asking me , but here ' s what I ' d do : Market Quinn Buckner for a No. 1 draft choice . It doesn ' t even have to be for 1984 , just as long as it ' s a No. 1 . I really like Quinn Buckner , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' d start Danny Ainge and Johnson , make Henderson my third guard and wouldn ' t worry about either Charles Bradley or John Schweitz because I ' ve still got Scott Wedman to move in as an occasional big guard . K.C. should be lying awake nights figuring ways to get Wedman into the game , anyway . I ' m just trying to do him a favor . Item - With K.C. Jones as coach instead of Bill Fitch , the Celtics are suddenly the Good Ship Lollipop . Wonderful . I ' m happy for them . And I ' m sure they will play hard for K.C. at the start of the season . The test will come after the new year , when the season settles into its deadly pattern of dreary practices , tedious games and boring trips . Let ' s see how they react following a tough loss on the road , or after one of those NBA specials when a bad referee does more damage to them than a Moses Malone . Bill Fitch , for all his faults , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won ' t drive them in the same manner . This year we ' ll find out exactly how many men - and how many babies - we have on this team . Before I forget : Orioles in six .
