In the future these terms - push and pull - should continue to apply to the way the two nations relate to each other. // Pushing the two countries together will be the continued rapid growth of the border region , with its resulting environmental and infra-structural problems . Urbanization will be especially fast in Mexico . Population gains for Mexico ' s northern border are the highest in the country , surpassing even Mexico City. // // Also pushing the countries together will be policy shifts in both nations allowing more official communication and decisionmaking at the local and state levels. // But some border-region observers also foresee a number of factors tending to pull the two sides apart . One is a falling peso , which could force Mexicans along the border to look away from the north and more to the interior of their own country . In addition , Mexican mistrust of US motives and perceptions of American arrogance vis-a-vis the border region could continue to pull the two sides away from each other. // Lino Vega exemplifies the cooperation that has brought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superintendent of the Nogales International Wastewater Treatment Plant , Mr. Vega oversees treatment of sewage from both Nogales , Ariz. , and Nogales , Sonora - two cities separated only by the international border. // ' ' Considering the terrain , a combined plant is really the most logical solution , ' ' says Vega , noting that at Nogales , the flow of water is into Arizona , where the plant is located. // Payment for water treatment is determined by the two countries ' International Boundary and Water Commission ( IBWC ) , according to the volume of water treated from each side , and respective treatment standards . Thus Mexico does not pay for chlorination of the effluent , since that is not the practice south of the border. // Yet a solution that appears logical to Mr. Vega is unlikely to be repeated along the border . The trend for at least a decade has been for each side to treat its own sewage - a solution that has not always meant quick remedy of border water pollution problems. // In San Diego , which has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to treat the southern city ' s wastewater in the US were terminated when Mexican authorities opted to build their own treatment plants. // ' ' That was a political decision by Mexico , ' ' reflecting a desire to maintain sovereignty over its own affairs , says Manuel Ibarra , secretary of the US section of the IBWC . Yet other border specialists say the decision reflects Mexico ' s distrust of US actions along the border. // The slowing of border crossings to a snail ' s pace this summer after drug-related violence in Mexico against US government agents is a case in point . Such a step ' ' shows the Mexicans what we ' re capable of doing , ' ' says Joseph Nalven , associate director of the Institute for Regional Studies of the Californias at San Diego State University . The Mexican concern , Mr. Nalven says , is that if joint water or sewage-treatment projects were developed , ' ' What ' s to stop ( the Americans ) from some day shutting off the pipes ? ' ' // Just the lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides of the border . Said Julio Torrescoto Mazier , Tijuana ' s assistant director for planning , in a recent San Diego speech , ' ' While you may be worried about pollution on your beaches , we are concerned about having enough water to go around in our community . ' ' Noting that 50 percent of Tijuanans don ' t have running water , he added , ' ' If we have to choose between a sewage line and a water line , we ' ll choose the water line . The pollution of Imperial Beach will not be our priority. ' ' // In spite of these differences , Mr. Torrescoto is one border-region official who speaks optimistically of policy shifts on both sides that should enhance local control and communication. // In 1983 , a highly centralized Mexico began allowing states and municipalities more autonomy in setting priorities and responding to their own specific needs . That trend , Torrescoto says , promises perhaps no immediate ' ' binational planning along the border , but at least to facilitate the flow of communication and information. ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan ' s New Federalism - that is to say , decreases in federal assistance to states and municipalities - is also leading to a greater emphasis on local solutions on the American side. // In 1982 , California established the Office of California-Mexico Affairs , and the state Legislature has begun holding hearings on issues affecting the two sides of the border . In Texas , state agriculture officials signed an agreement with Mexico this summer to promote joint research , reduce trade barriers , and aid farmers on both sides of the border by matching growers with markets. // ' ' Most of us along the border agree we can solve our own problems better without interference from either federal government , ' ' says Howard Applegate , a civil engineering professor at the University of Texas at El Paso who specializes in border pollution . Noting that the IBWC has been reluctant to add air quality to its charge , Dr. Applegate says local governments should take advantage of their increased autonomy to address joint pollution problems. // Along those lines , some border experts advocate extending the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regional government along the border. // Ellwyn Stoddard , an anthropology and sociology professor at the University of Texas at El Paso , proposes a 200-mile zone along the border in which local authorities could make regional agreements . ' ' In everything from health care to local pollution and planning , ' ' says Dr. Stoddard , ' ' we who know best about the special circumstances we face down here would be able to address our own problems. ' ' // Stoddard says his proposal differs from that of a border trade zone , recently proposed in Congress , because it would go farther in addressing the border ' s problems by ' ' removing bureaucracy , not adding to it . A free-trade zone would mean three borders instead of the one problem we already have. ' ' // Economically , a falling peso is likely to continue its profound effect on border relations . Now at about 500 pesos to the dollar , some experts do not rule out a tumble to 1 , 000 pesos to the dollar by the turn of the century. // Currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s income is spent in the US . The fallout from any abrupt drop in Mexican spending across the border , as occurred after a major devaluation of the peso in 1982 , is mixed : hardly felt in big and diversified San Diego County , but crippling in more isolated border towns farther east. // Some experts predict the peso ' s continuing decline will force border Mexicans to reorient themselves away from the US , and toward the interior of their own country. // Gustavo del Castillo , a research fellow at the Institute of the Americas in La Jolla , Calif. , notes that California-Mexico trade fell about 60 percent , from more than $3 billion to $1. 5 billion , after the 1982 peso devaulation. // Another research fellow at the institute , David Barken , says the Mexican border region ' s growing ' ' inward orientation ' ' will be positive , because it will force Mexicans to produce goods , especially food , for domestic rather than foreign consumption. // ' ' At this point in history you can ' t close off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also director of an economic development institute in Mexico City . But reduced reliance on American products , he says , will necessarily entail the kind of economic development the Mexican border region needs. // Yet even if a declining peso forces Mexican consumers to spend more at home , it will also make Mexico an even better bargain for American tourists and businesses seeking cheap labor . And this will only increase the country ' s dependence on its northern neighbor. // In any case , most border observers see the penetration of both sides by its neighbor as continuing in spite of fluctuating economic conditions. // ' ' The ( Mexican ) border states are highly influenced by their proximity to America , ' ' says Guillermina Valdez Villalva , a social psychologist in Cuidad Juarez with the Center for Northern Border Studies . ' ' Much of the country has been suspicious of . . . ( northern Mexico ' s ) orientation , ' ' but she says that perception is changing. // ' ' Before the North was the black sheep . Now it ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the future of Mexico as a modern industrial state. ' ' // And from the US side , IBWC secretary Ibarra says he ' s confident the border ' s ' ' cooperative mechanism ' ' will continue to be strengthened . ' ' It may not be perfect , but at least we see the communication increasing . For a border region that could almost double in population to 14 or 15 million people by the year 2000 , that ' s important. ' ' // //
