For more than 40 years , the dead weight of domination by the U.S.S.R. and repression by Stalinist regimes crushed political culture in Eastern Europe . Now , with the encouragement of the Kremlin , reformers are lifting the boulder . But in the midst of burgeoning democracy , personal freedom and national independence , some verminous creatures are crawling into the sunlight . The ugliest and most poisonous is anti-Semitism , which has a long and robust history in that part of the world . <P> A recent issue of the Soviet weekly Ogonyok , which has campaigned against anti-Semitism , printed some of the hate mail it has received : " You Jews started this damn revolution , and now your plot to ruin Mother Russia has succeeded " and " We must not let you slink out of the country , or we 'll have to hunt you down like Trotsky . We 'll get you here , because that way it will be cheaper . " <P> Earlier this year Poland 's Primate , Jozef Cardinal Glemp , objected to an agreement among four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carmelite convent that had been established at the Nazi death camp of Auschwitz . Although he later backed down , Glemp compounded the insult to Jews , charging " Your power lies in the mass media easily at your disposal . " <P> " The Glemp episode is a reminder of the genteel anti-Semitism that has always been just below the surface and , in the current , more permissive climate , can come poking through , " says Charles Gati , an expert on Eastern Europe at Union College in Schenectady , N.Y . Gati has found thinly disguised Jew baiting back in fashion in his native Hungary . One of the top-ranked soccer teams , MTK , was heavily financed by Jews in the 1930s before more than half of the Jewish community was murdered by the Nazis and their Hungarian offshoot , the Arrow Cross Party . Now , half a century later , the historical association lingers : when the team runs onto the field , the crowd sometimes shouts , " Goose merchants ! "  --  a barnyard variation on the odious stereotype of Jews as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain that post- Communist Eastern Europe will fully embrace Western values . " <P> When George Lorinczi , a Hungarian-born Washington lawyer , visited Budapest last month , he heard racial epithets on the street directed at people around him . In the anti-Communist tirades of self-professed liberals , there were pointed references to the predominance of Jews in the regime of dictator ! Matyas Rakosi in the early 1950s . " People are now rolling words off their tongues that would have made them jailbait two years ago , " says Lorinczi . <P> Nor is the phenomenon confined to the snarls of the lumpen proletariat or the cafe chatter of polite society . Western diplomats in Budapest say some leaders of the opposition Hungarian Democratic Forum have made Glempish noises about the undue influence in the media of " alien forces "  --  code words considerably less obscure than " goose merchants .
