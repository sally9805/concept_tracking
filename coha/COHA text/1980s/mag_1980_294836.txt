ALTERED STATES Directed by Ken Russell ; Screenplay by Sidney Aaron <P> This one has everything : sex , violence , comedy , thrills , tenderness . It 's an anthology and apotheosis of American pop movies : Frankenstein , Murders in the Rue Morgue , The Nutty Professor , 2001 , Alien , Love Story . It opens at fever pitch and then starts soaring-into genetic fantasy , into a precognitive dream of delirium and delight . Madness is its subject and substance , style and spirit . The film changes tone , even form , with its hero 's every new mood and mutation . It expands and contracts with his mind until both almost crack . It keeps threatening to go bonkers , then makes good on its threat , and still remains as lucid as an aerialist on a high wire . It moves with the loping energy of a crafty psychopath , or of film makers gripped with the potential of blowing the moviegoer 's mind out through his eyes and ears . Ladies and gentlemen , welcome to Altered States . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Harvard Medical School . Years before , he had studied the nature of schizophrenia by immersing his subjects-and later himself-in a dark tank of warm water . Now , continuing his experiment under the apprehensive eyes of his wife Emily ( Blair Brown ) and his colleagues ( Bob Balaban and Charles Haid ) , Eddie determines that " our other states of consciousness are as real as our waking states . And that reality can be externalized . " He imagines , or remembers , himself as primitive man ; he becomes that lithe , voracious ape-human . <P> He views the birth of the world , of the soul ; he enters into it , becomes it . Clearly , the experiments of this modern mad scientist have got out of hand - and too far into himself . Can he return ? This is a question whose application here can be debated and debunked by those familiar with the work of Dr. John Lilly , the behavioral scientist whose use of tank therapy prefigured Eddie 's . But most moviegoers will be enthralled by the fiction in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a love story ? Yes : of man as the eternally curious child and woman as the maternal source and resource . It is also , implicitly , the story of Jesus and Mary . Eddie is consumed by the dream of transcendence , of return to the modern godhead of the self . He is off on a perilous trip down through the memory of the race , and his only connection to reality is the umbilical cord of his need and , finally , his love for Emily . He often curls naked into her side as if wounded , seeking succor , reliving the Pieta . Again and again , Eddie dies and is reborn ; each time he finds the action frightening , and " supremely satisfying . " At the end , the couple fuse and are redeemed through the power of love . Altered States opens in New York and Los Angeles on Christmas Day . <P> <P> One expected some kind of combustion from the meeting of those sacred zanies , Paddy Chayefsky and Ken Russell , but one hardly dared hope it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nice-guy naturalism of Marty , onto the fast track of madhouse satire :
