Has Rupert Murdoch finally found someone to buy the New York Post , his money- gulping tabloid ? Murdoch does n't want to part with the 187-year-old Post but is under pressure to do so as early as next month , or be in violation of a federal law barring ownership of both a newspaper and a TV station in the same city . Last week the media mogul was on the brink of selling the daily for about $40 million to Manhattan Developer Peter Kalikow . The agreement leaves so many escape hatches , however , that the outcome is far from certain . Kalikow can walk away from the deal if the Post 's unions balk at the wage concessions he plans to demand . Murdoch has the right to back out if he overturns the cross-ownership ban in court or if he gets a better offer .
