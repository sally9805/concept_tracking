So , 1 , 300 years before him , did Chang Chien , emissary of the powerful emperor Wu-Ti of the Han Dynasty , spying out the ' ' western regions ' ' and hoping to obtain the swift horses of Ferghana for his master ' s cavalry. // So did a host of generals , officials , merchants , priests , plunderers , and adventurers from east and west , seeking conquest , or riches , or religious enlightenment , on what Westerners came to call the Silk Road from China to Persia and on to Byzantium and Rome. // The Silk Road thrived when China was strong , when the emperor ' s writ ran from the Central China Plain to the steppes of central Asia . It declined when , under the Ming Dynasty ( 1368-1644 ) , Chinese armies withdrew behind the Great Wall , and the sea route to India and Europe became safer and more reliable than camel caravans across the Gobi Desert. // Today , under the People ' s Republic , China is strong again . But for the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Turfan , the Silk Road is a memory , useful mainly in attracting tourists from distant Europe and America. // The two-humped Bactrian camel has been retired from service as the ship of the desert , except to carry occasional scientific expeditions . You can pick up a camel in Dunhuang for 300 yuan ( less the $200 ) , less than what a good mule or horse might cost . You can use a camel to pull a cart , but he eats too much and is not as versatile as a donkey or a horse in plowing a field or taking goods to market. // Instead of being exotic staging posts on the way to Europe , cities farther along the Silk Road , like Kaxgar or Aksu , are sensitive military garrison towns , closed to most foreigners , alert to what the Soviet Union may be planning on its side of the central Asian frontier. // China no longer looks outward along the old Silk Road , as it did in the spacious days of Tang , when merchants from Persia and holy men from India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight streets of Changan , present-day Xian. // Instead , it has paved and slightly rerouted the Silk Road , paralleling it with a railroad that ties Sinkiang  --  for many years known more romantically in the West as Chinese Turkestan - more closely to what used to be called China proper than any preceding dynasty. // The railroad , an extension of the east-west Longhai line from Sian through Lanzhou to Urumchi , capital of Sinkiang , fulfills Dr. Sun Yat Sen ' s vision of a unified China securely held together by trunk lines crisscrossing the country east to west and north to south . Lanzhou , the jumping-off point for excursions along the old Silk Road , has become not only a metropolis of 1 million inhabitants , but also a communications hub , with rail lines radiating east to Sian and Shanghai , north to Inner Mongolia and Peking , west to Urumchi , and south to Sining nd Golmud in desolate Qinghai Province . The Sining-Golmud line will eventually extend to Lhasa , capital of Tibet. // One thing the Lanzhou-Urumchi line definitely will not do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the early 1950s , the days of euphoric Sino-Soviet brotherhood , such a link was planned . It would have had the modern version of the old Silk Road ending in Moscow. // Nevertheless , as one voyages from oasis to oasis along the modern version of the Silk Road , sometimes by bus or car , sometimes by slow-moving train still pulled by hissing steam engines , one is aware of moving out along the fringes of Chinese civilization , culture , and language into an area of marches where the ethnic Chinese presence is progressively diluted by Tibetan , Mongol , and Turkic minorities until , crossing from Dunhuang , the last ethnic Chinese oasis , into Sinkiang , the Chinese themselves , or the Han , as Peking calls ethnic Chinese , have become a minority. // Of Sinkiang ' s 12 million people , 7 million are non-Han , according to Wang Wenheng , chief spokesman on minority affairs for the Chinese Communist Party in Sinkiang . The largest ethnic group , the Uighurs , number slightly more than the next largest group , the Han @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a veritable crazy-quilt pattern of peoples , from Kazakhs and Hui ( Chinese Muslims ) to Kirghiz , Mongol , Tajik , Sibo , Tatar , Uzbek , Manchu , and even 1 , 000 Russians who hold Chinese passports. // Already , in Gansu Province ( of which Lanzhou is the capital ) , taking the bus from Jiayuguan ( where the Great Wall ended in Ming days ) past the Yumen oil fields , the ruined Fortress of Qiaowan , the oasis town of Anxi , to Dunhuang , verdant in the desert now as it was in Marco Polo ' s day and for at least 1 , 000 years before that , one is aware of the majestic line of the Qilian Mountains , perennially snowcapped , keeping one company from oasis to oasis. // Behind the Qilian Mountains are the Tibetans , who repeatedly marauded the oases until a wise Tang emperor sent his daughter , the Princess Wenching , to marry the Tibetan king of those days . Northward stretches the Gobi , across which Marco Polo traveled from Dunhuang to Karakhoto ( Heicheng @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present-day Chengde ) north of Peking for his first audience with Kublai Khan . The Gobi is Mongol , even today . It is only the narrow strip of the Gansu corridor , stretching 600 miles from Lanzhou to Dunhuang , that remains ethnically Chinese , and even here one can come across Tibetan peasants and Mongol or Kazakh herdsmen. // The flat wheatfields of the North China Plain , the square-hulled junks and the green rice paddies of the Yangtze Valley seem far away . Here all is sand and stone , fine dust and baked mud . The trucks that roar past on the modern Silk Road may be carrying oil-drilling equipment for the Cai dam in Qinghai or Karamai in Sinkiang . Who knows ? Under the tarpaulin may be top-secret nuclear or rocket materials for the missile testing station at Lop Nor near the ancient ruins of Loulan . Marco Polo might be bewildered by the gas-guzzling behemoths that have replaced his two-humped camels . But he would be reassured by the donkeys and mules still plodding along in the trail of the dust raised by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must halt for their own security when sudden swirling sandstorms turn the sky black and rain basalt pebbles against their windshields. // He would know that as in his day , so in ours , the most welcome sight in these desolate parts is the green of trees , the sparkle of water . Man and his inventions have changed along the old Silk Road , but nature remains the same. // //
