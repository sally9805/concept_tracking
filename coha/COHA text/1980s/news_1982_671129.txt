Englewood ' s Pontiac dealer and its Chevrolet dealer had gone under before Mulliken Ford . These are grim times in the automobile business , and not just in Detroit . In the New York metropolitan region , high car prices , high interest rates that have only recently started to drop , high rents and stiff Japanese competition have combined to do in dozens of newcar dealers . <> <> Dealer Outlines the Problems // Mr. Mulliken talks about " security problems , " by which he means crime , and a " deteriorating business climate , " by which he means a loss of customers . He also talks about domestic manufacturers , which he means to include the Ford Motor Company , who have failed to provide " a product readily salable in our market segment , " meaning cars with options and at prices that can compete with foreign imports. // In the New York City-Westchester County-Long Island area , there are 32 fewer new-car dealers than there were just two years ago , according to the Automobile Dealers Association of Greater New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New Jersey , according to that state ' s Automobile Dealers Association. // The Greater New York area - New York City and Westchester , Nassau and Suffolk Counties - has 435 new-car dealers , down from 467 at the end of March 1980 , the dealers organization said . New Jersey has 710 , down from 820 at the beginning of 1980. // The loss of dealers nationwide has been heavy , too . In the first six months of this year , according to Automotive News , a trade publication , 556 dealerships went out of business , compared with 325 in the first half of 1981 and 930 in the first half of 1980 . Automotive News puts the current number of domestic-car dealerships nationwide at 21 , 124 . <> <> First Drop Was the Worst // " We took our bath in the first half of 1980 , " said Charles Walton , executive vice president of the New Jersey dealers group . " For that entire year , we dropped 64 dealers , but 40 of them went out during the first six months. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexperienced guys , " Mr. Walton said . " The men who are left own their own property , have pared down their staffs and are digging in . They ' ve made the decision to stay and they are the strong operators who will make it. " // Not all dealers agree . " It ' s been bad but it ' s going to get worse , " said Edward Mullane , a Ford Dealer in Bergenfield , N.J. , and president of the Ford Dealers Alliance , a maverick group that spars with the parent company in Detroit . " There ' s a good chance that the business will never come back , " Mr. Mullane said . " The consumer has gotten out of the new car habit . Volume will never be the same again. " // " The factory keeps talking about pent-up demand , " he continued . " There is a good chance that this pent-up demand doesn ' t exist . Certainly not at present price levels . " <> <> Japan Went Unchallenged // Mr. Mullane is highly critical of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so large a share of the American market. // " Ford has one model with front-wheel drive , " Mr. Mullane said . " Toyota , Honda , Datsun - they offer front-wheel drive , diesel options , fuel injection , all the new innovations . And the car body fits together. " // According to the most recent figures , imports make up 31 percent of the new-car market in this country , and Japanese cars make up 80 percent of that share. // Al Burns , editor of the Car Dealer ' s Insider Newsletter , a trade publication , sees high rents and taxes as major problems for automobile agencies . <> <> Real Estate Is a Factor // " If they own their own place , " he said , " they discover that it ' s often worth more as real estate . So they sell it or build apartments and go into the real estate business . People need a place to live more than they need a car. " // A major Manhattan auto agency , one of the few left , is up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a couple of prospective buyers , " he said , " but they backed off when they discovered that the real estate is not included. " // Dealer attrition in the New York region has tapered off , Mr. Burns believes . " We never did feel the full impact of the recession here , " he said , " and we will probably come back sooner. " // Also , he noted , most aggressive dealers in the region have at least one other franchise , either for a domestic car or an import . " You ' ve got to be dualed to survive , " he said . <> <> Resentment Turns to Regret // One dealer who has not " dualed " is Lawrence Tynan , who sells Chevrolets in Middletown , N.J. Mr. Tynan , who resented the Japanese intrusions into the American market , now regrets not having taken on an import several years ago . " The good franchises are gone now , " he said. // " A Chevrolet agency used to be like an annuity , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we thought Chevy would always come up with the right cars at the right price at the right time . Now they are renting their empty plants to the Japanese , like the one in California they are turning over to Honda . They are building cars against us. " // His agency , Town Chevrolet , is selling 60 percent fewer new cars than it did as recently as 1979 . " We get by on parts and service , used car sales , and car rentals , " he said . " I ' ll stay in business , but it won ' t be easy. " // So far this year , New Jersey has lost 14 dealers and gained three : a Saab agency in Trenton , a Subaru agency going to a man already selling Buicks in Jersey City , and a Chevrolet agency in Berlin , near Camden . <> <> Dealer Leader Is Pessimistic // Irwin Katz , president of the Greater New York Dealers Association and a Chevrolet dealer in Croton , N.Y. , also expects more dealers to disappear before the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It should be incumbent on them , " Mr. Katz said , " to take action to buy out or relocate troubled dealerships . We had buy-out programs in the 1950 ' s and the 1960 ' s . Now , they don ' t even hope for attrition . They ' re only too anxious to reopen any dealership that closes . They ' ve eliminated a few , but only because they could ' t find some sucker to come in and take the spot. " // One glimmer in the gloomy automobile picture is the resurgence , slight though it might be so far , of Chrysler . Chrysler had a net increase of 10 dealers nationwide in the second quarter of the year , compared with Ford , which lost 80 , and General Motors , which lost 140 , from a much larger base . <> <> Chrysler Gains a Convert // Al Mangiacapra used to sell Fiats . Now he runs Hillcrest Dodge in Huntington , L.I. " It was obvious that Fiat was going nowhere , " Mr. Mangiacapra said . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened in March and have done very , very well. " // " It ' s not just the cars , " said a Ford dealer who has not switched over . " Those guys are really following Iacocca . " Lee Iacocca , who was dismissed as president of Ford , is widely credited with having given Chrysler a new life and a new competitive spirit. // The Ford dealer , who declined for reasons of business to be named , said that while he continues to sell Fords , he keeps a picture of Mr. Iacocca in his office. //
