For generations , Britain has reveled in a system of weights and measures that confounds the outside world . Instead of using the no-nonsense metric system , Britons measured their cricket pitches in chains ( 22 yds. ) , their horse races in furlongs ( 220 yds. ) , their meat in pounds and their beer in pints . Bowing to a proposal of the European Community , however , the British have tentatively agreed to convert their systems to metric , starting in 1994 . <P> But not all of them . It 's goodbye to the pound , the ounce , the gill ( 4 fl. oz. ) and the rod ( a quarter of a chain ) . But the furlong will stay because it occurs only in sports , as will the troy ounce ( 31 g , vs. 28 g for the standard ounce ) because gold-bullion operations could n't survive without it . As for the pint , the measure of morning milk and evening ale for millions , London hopes the Community will agree that it just would n't be cricket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
