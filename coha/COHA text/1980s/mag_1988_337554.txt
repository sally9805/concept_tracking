O Baltimore , city of Edgar Allan Poe and H.L. Mencken , of Johnny Unitas and Brooks Robinson , of aluminum-siding salesmen and rampaging transvestites ! How lucky thou art to have two sublimely eccentric moviemakers , Barry Levinson and John Waters , as native sons who sing your praises ! Levinson set his two best movies , Diner and Tin Men , in the Baltimore of the late ' 50s and early ' 60s . Waters has made all eleven of his pictures , from the coprophagous comedy Pink Flamingos to the all-stinking Polyester ( filmed in Odorama ) , in his hometown . <P> At first Waters worked on outlaw subjects and weeny budgets . Now that few moviegoers can be outraged by the antics of his crass menagerie , this past master of bad taste has pulled the ultimate shockeroo : he has made a PG movie . Even more horrifying , Hairspray is in imminent danger of becoming a mainstream hit . Baltimore may never forgive him . <P> Welcome back to 1962 , when the city had already established its reputation as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collins ' TV dance party , white teenagers perform all the latest dances  --  the Madison , the Continental , the Pony  --  and are local heroes to every adolescent . Chief among these starlets is Amber Von Tussle ( Colleen Fitzpatrick ) , a snooty princess whose dad ( Sonny Bono ) is the " richest man in East Baltimore " and whose mom ( Debbie Harry ) , Miss Soft Crab of 1945 , pours all her ambition into Amber . Every afternoon the pouty miss must practice the cha-cha and the Mashed Potato under Mom 's eagle eye . " I want you to get more close-ups on that show , " Mom admonishes , " or I 'm sending you to Catholic school ! " Eeuuuu ! <P> Amber soon finds she has a zaftig rival : Tracy Turnblad ( Ricki Lake ) , who is plump , perky and , pound for bouffanted pound , the snappiest Caucasian dancer in town . The girl has that je ne sais quoi called Star Quality . Soon Tracy is outshining Amber on TV , modeling dresses for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by insisting that black teenagers be allowed to dance along with whites on Corny 's show . <P> Stardom proves no cinch for our heroine . The school authorities declare that Tracy 's hairdo is a " hair-do n't " and exile her to the special ed class . She and Link Larkin ( Michael St. Gerard ) , her " common-law boyfriend , " are ostracized from their keen teen group . Her best friend , Penny Pingleton ( Leslie Ann Powers ) , is denounced as a " checkerboard chick " for dating a black student and is tortured by a loopy psychiatrist . And Amber 's mom starts a catty rumor about Tracy : " For all we know , she could be high yellow . " <P> For his story about integration , Waters has aptly miscegenated two irreconcilable movie genres : the teen flick and the message movie . He has invaded John Hughes territory , but with his own road map . No Molly Ringwald needed ; Lake is the dream image of every girl who has ever craved that eighth Twinkie . No teen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and matching mother-daughter outfits of a more naive era . No anxious parental conflict , at least when Tracy 's mom is played by Divine , the 300-lb. actor who always looks the height of fashion in a housedress . And no sweat , Baltimore : Waters has done you proud . Watch the moon shimmer in a puddle ( as a rat crawls through it ) . See Tracy triumphant , in her pink roach-patterned evening gown . See Hairspray too . It 's light and airy , but it will stick around : the first aerosol movie .
