But , before he can do so , Mr. Perelman must win a fight that would give pause to even the most experienced of corporate raiders. // // May Have Met Match // Indeed , as a fledgling at the hostile takeover game , Mr. Perelman may have met his match in Michel C. Bergerac. chairman of Revlon , The head of the cosmetic and health-care giant is fighting to fend off Pantry Pride , the corporate vehicle Mr. Perelman is using in his $1. 9 billion takeover bid , by denying him access to the very treasures he is seeking . Through recent Revlon board action , the company ' s balance sheet would become highly leveraged if a hostile acquirer appears on the scene . Legal restrictions would also make it difficult to sell off assets or to tap an overfunded pension fund for extra cash. // Despite Wall Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perelman insists he intends to continue . In his first interview since announcing his hostile bid for the health-care and cosmetics giant , Mr. Perelman yesterday sounded far from vanquished . He labeled Revlon ' s debt-for-stock takeover defense offer " outstandingly absurd and horrendous " for shareholders , adding that Pantry Pride would proceed this week with plans to sell the $900 million in notes that it would need to pay for the proposed acquisition . <> <> Other Possibilities // If Revlon falls through , however , there are plenty of other companies Mr. Perelman said he would consider buying . He currently has two staff members working full time at coming up with a list of possible acquisitions . Revlon , he added , is only one of 50 on that list. // The battle for Revlon marks Mr. Perelman ' s first hostile takeover attempt since he left his father ' s Philadelphia metal-fabricating business in 1978 and struck out on his own. // Mr. Perelman ' s father , Raymond , clearly had a big influence on his oldest son , who began to sit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After earning a master ' s from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1966 , Mr. Perelman ' s joined his father ' s business. // Why did he leave ? " It wasn ' t enough , " he said . " I wanted to create an entity on my own , without the constraints of the familial relationship. " // Mr. Perelman clearly takes offense at Revlon ' s description of him as " a bust-up artist. " // " We are not liquidators , " he said , adding that he views himself as " a builder " who has " maximized the inherent value of the companies we purchased . " <> <> Run the Gamut // Revlon ' s cosmetics operations ( Mr. Perelman plans to sell its health-care businesses ) would join an empire whose businesses run the gamut from licorice extract and chocolate to theatrical film processing , video casettes and cigars. // Mr. Perelman , 42 years old , predicted that in 1985 , MacAndrews &; Forbes Group , his operating company , would generate revenues of $750 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million . That is excluding Pantry Pride , in which Mr. Perelman holds about a 37 percent stake. // Despite MacAndrews &; Forbes modest size , Mr. Perelman is no stranger to executives of far larger corporations . He hobnobs with such film executives as Martin S. Davis , chairman of Gulf and Western Industries , Lew R. Wasserman , chairman of MCA Inc. and Terry Semel , president of Warner Brothers . He also counts among his friends Ace Greenberg , managing director of Bear , Stearns &; Company , the investment banking firm . Referring to his company ' s film-related activites , Mr. Perelman said , " In that business , personal relationships are required . " <> <> Three Lieutenants // For the most part , Mr. Perelman allows the men he has hired to run his businesses to do just that . Working out of MacAndrews &; Forbes headquarters in Mr. Perelman ' s Manhattan town house , Mr. Perelman and his three MacAndrews &; Forbes lieutenants - vice chairman , Howard Gittis , senior vice president and chief financial officer , Fred L. Tepperman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Mr. Perelman scorns the flashy image that he seems to have acquired . His marriage to Claudia Cohen , entertainment reporter for WABC-TV in New York , and a lavish wedding celebration that his in-laws threw for him at the Palladium , a chic Manhattan night club , helped him earn that image. // Describing himself as a man who is " conservative in nature " and who shuns publicity - he has only granted one other interview - Mr. Perelman said his idea of a good time is to go to sleep by 10 P.M. <> <> Tough and Shrewd // Those who have negotiated with him describe him as a shrewd and tough opponent . But in at least one deal , he may have outfoxed himself . He originally negotiated to buy Consolidated Cigar from Gulf and Western for $104 million , and then withdrew from the deal . When he later purchased it in 1984 from management , the price was $124 million . Mr. Perelman defends the price , noting that debt reductions and operational changes made it " worth more to me. " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and larger deals since his first acquisition in 1978 of 40 percent of Cohen-Hatfield Industries , a jewelry distributor and retailer listed on the American Stock Exchange , for $2 million. // In 1980 , Cohen-Hatfield then paid about $45 million for MacAndrews &; Forbes Company , a big supplier of licorice extract and chocolate . Cohen-Hatfield took the MacAndrews &; Forbes name . <> <> Acquisitions Snowballed // Since then , Mr. Perelman ' s acquisitions have snowballed . In the last two and a half years , he has spent a total of $353 million for Technicolor Inc. , the big film processor ; Consolidated Cigar ; Video Corporation of America , a major manufacturer of home video cassettes ; the film-processing assets of Movie Labs , and the controlling interest in Pantry Pride. // What is the common denominator in businesses that are as different as , well , licorice extract and professional film processing ? " We look for companies that are strong cash-flow generators and are free from major capital expenditure requirements , " Mr. Perelman explained . High tech and " fad " companies do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Investments // Mr. Perelman appears to be able to spot companies where there is a chance to sell off assets and whose earnings problems are masking some tremendous strengths . In the last eight years , Mr. Perelman has proved himself a master at paring down acquisitions to their highly profitable cores and recovering his investment very quickly. // While he was negotiating the purchase of MacAndrews and &; Forbes , Mr. Perelman convinced the company to sell a failing polyester operation . After purchasing Technicolor , Mr. Perelman decided to keep only its theatrical film-processing unit . Five other divisions - ranging from a new chain of one-hour photo processing stores to a film library - sold for approximately $60 million , and the sale of some of Technicolor ' s London real estate is expected to fetch about $8 million . These divestitures go a long way toward reducing what had seemed like a steep $105 million price he paid for Technicolor. //
