NEW YORK  --  When Beatrice Cos. shareholders vote today to sell out to a group that will take the giant food company private , they will also be placing a crown on the deal ' s architects , the investment banking firm of Kohlberg , Kravis , Roberts &; Co . With a value of $6. 2 billion , Beatrice is the largest going-private agreement ever , while the $45 million that Kohlberg Kravis will get for arranging it is the largest single investment advisory fee on record . Riding the takeover boom of the 1980s , Kohlberg Kravis , or KKR in Wall Street lingo , has rocketed to prominence by taking companies private via purchases heavily financed with bank debt , a technique called the leveraged buyout . In the process , the firm and its four partners have helped change the face of corporate America and have made themselves wealthy . Sixty-year-old Jerome Kohlberg Jr . ; Henry R. Kravis and George R. Roberts , both 42 , and Robert I. MacDonnell , 47 , are individually worth between $150 million and $500 million , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , KKR guards its affairs with Garbo-like secrecy . Numerous requests for interviews for this story were politely rejected . But KKR can ' t be ignored . It is paramount among about 200 organizations that construct leveraged buyouts , or LBOs . Including its Storer Communications Inc. and Union Texas Petroleum Co. buyouts  --  each worth over $2 billion  --  KKR accounted for a total of over $6 billion in buyouts last year , or about a third of the record $18 billion total . Fees from such arrangements are changing the lives of the firm ' s partners . Mr. Kravis last year moved into a 16-room , $5. 5 million , two-fireplace Park Avenue apartment in a building where John D. Rockefeller Jr. once lived . Mr. Kohlberg bought an exclusive estate in northern Westchester County , a short drive from the mansions of such Wall Street titans as Carl Icahn and Ivan Boesky . But these are critical times for KKR . Because of the bullish stock market , which has made buyouts more expensive , plus restrictions by bank regulators and possible removal of a federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far this year is far behind the 1985 pace . The buyout boom was spawned by a number of factors . By going private , a company can prevent a hostile takeover , eliminate both the need for public disclosure and the pressure to show short-term earnings gains , and provide incumbent managers and venturers like KKR with a chance to reap large profits . Under a leveraged buyout , a group of investors buys a company ( or a division of a company ) from public shareholders , usually using a combination of bank loans and high-yield , high-risk " junk " securities . The group generally includes the investment-banking firm that designed the deal , company management , and financial institutions such as insurance companies , pension funds and endowments . If the price is right , shareholders approve the agreement without much fuss , so today ' s vote by Beatrice shareholders is only a formality . The bank debt of a bought-out company is reduced via cash flow and often by the sale of some assets . The company pays little or no federal income tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And its assets are marked up as though it were a new company , giving it large tax deductions for depreciation . Later , after most of the bank debt is repaid , the company is likely to be sold again to the public or to another company , giving members of the original buyout group a chance to make big profits . " LBOs are an absolutely ingenious invention , " says Michael C. Jensen , a Harvard Business School professor . " Public companies may grow fat and sloppy . LBOs put management on the razor ' s edge to create efficiencies so the debt can be paid off . " Others aren ' t so certain . Says Scott Cowen , the dean of the management school at Case-Western Reserve University : " We ' ll need several more years of experience with LBOs before we ' ll know whether they create any overall value . " The test , he says , will be when more of these companies " come back public and we see what their market share and earnings look like . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move designed to curb the use of junk bonds , adopted a requirement that shell-type companies , often set up to do leveraged buyouts , must use at least 50% cash to finance their acquisitions . And the comptroller of the currency may soon issue tighter guidelines on LBO loans , a spokeswoman says . " The comptroller once considered LBOs a good thing , " says John Lyons , a New York bank consultant , " but recently it has been scrutinizing LBOs as possible tax gimmicks " that don ' t enhance the value of the bought-out company . Moreover , proposed federal tax revisions threaten to crimp LBOs . One would bar write-ups of assets for most types of companies going private via an LBO . The House has passed the measure , but the Senate hasn ' t yet acted . Such attitudes may help explain the marked going-private slowdown this year . Through March 15 of this year , about $533 million of buyouts has been completed , or less than one-ninth of the $4. 9 billion a year earlier , according to Mergers &; Acquisitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly raise the 1986 total , investment bankers note that it was announced in 1985 , before the bull market and expressions of regulatory concern . Nonetheless , KKR is poised for more deals . It recently put together a $2 billion fund , its fifth and largest , to invest in new LBOs . Participants in its previous funds have included Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. , the pension plans of General Electric Co. and the state of Oregon ; and the endowment funds of Yale , Harvard and the Salvation Army . Investment gains or losses aren ' t logged until a company is sold again . Then , although KKR ' s stake in its investment partnerships is small , it gets , as general manager , 20% of any profit . But in the meantime , money still flows to KKR . It receives an annual management fee of at least 1. 5% of a fund ' s value for each of its buyout funds , plus fees for acting as an investment adviser and management consultant . In addition , KKR places some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the board of a bought-out company , and they get directors ' fees . KKR ' s partners and executives shared $160 million in fees last year , estimates an LBO expert at a rival investment firm . In part , it was a kinship affair : Mr. Kravis and Mr. Roberts are cousins ; Mr. MacDonnell is Mr. Roberts ' s brother-in-law ; Mr. Kravis ' s father , Raymond , a wealthy retired oil geologist in Oklahoma , is a KKR investor ; and Mr. Kohlberg ' s son James is a KKR executive . How have KKR and its co-investors fared ? On balance very well , although the jury is still out on the majority of their transactions . " I ' d back them in anything they did , " says John Canning , the president of First Chicago Venture Capital Corp. , a unit of First Chicago Corp. and an investor in 20 KKR transactions . First Chicago Venture ' s returns , Mr. Canning says , have exceeded 40% overall , even counting one loser , which he didn ' t identify . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion fund , KKR said that the firm and its partners had bought a total of $1. 5 billion in stock in 25 buyouts . The average annual compounded rate of return , the firm said , was 46. 8% on deals that reached the payback stage . The KKR circular and other documents indicate that the firm has carried out at least 29 LBOs . Twenty haven ' t reached the payback-to-investor stage ; four have been sold for a total investor profit of $482. 4 million ; and three have been partly sold at a profit to investors ( KKR remains an investor in each ) . Two  --  Foresthill , a timberlands investment and F.B. Truck Line  --  were sold at a total loss of $5. 7 million . Oregon ' s employee-benefit plan in two years got back $18 million on a $5 million investment in Golden West Broadcasters , an administrator of the plan says . And Oregon last year , he says , made a net profit of $67 million on a $27 million investment in Norris Industries Inc. , a 1981 KKR-sponsored buyout . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other state pension plans . " George Roberts came here and spent about six hours explaining how it worked , " recalls Robert Zobel , an official with the Wisconsin Investment Board , which recently invested $75 million in KKR ' s new fund . " They also sent us tons of materials . We met with them in their New York office , and we talked with other investors . They ' re a no-nonsense , yet personable , group . " Low-key is the description most often used by investment bankers who have dealt across the bargaining table from KKR people . Only once , some recall , have they seen Mr. Kravis , who usually leads the KKR contingent , become irritated . That occurred in 1984 after Gulf Corp. , facing a hostile suitor group headed by T. Boone Pickens of Mesa Petroleum Co. , took the unusual step of paying KKR a $7. 5 million fee to make a friendly bid for Gulf . In a meeting with Gulf executives , Mr. Kravis became angry and stormed out of the room when Gulf advisers questioned KKR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer . The offer has been estimated at $14. 5 billion , but no figure has ever been released . Shortly thereafter , Gulf directors formally rejected KKR ' s bid because of such " uncertainties " as financing and timing . At the same time the Gulf board rejected a bid by Atlantic Richfield Co. and approved Standard Oil Co. of California ' s all-cash offer of $13. 4 billion , the largest acquisition price in history . Mr. Pickens ' s Mesa group had the consolation of selling its Gulf shares for a net gain of $214 million after taxes . By contrast with his anger at the Gulf meeting , Mr. Kravis was composed last February at a grueling meeting with Beatrice directors . Mr. Kravis , a flyweight wrestler in prep school , withstood stinging questions from a director who wanted to know why KKR had reduced its per-share offer from $43 in cash and $7 in preferred stock to $40 in cash and $10 in preferred . " We ' d have to go back to the banks and explain why we needed more loans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks , " Mr. Kravis reportedly said . Banks are lending $3. 5 billion for the Beatrice purchase . Mr. Kravis is the only KKR partner to come slightly into public view . He is known as a collector of 19th-century British oil paintings , and he is on the board of the New York City Ballet , to which he is said to make six-figure annual contributions . Last year he was seen publicly at such swank restaurants as the 21 Club with Carolyne Roehm , a 34-year-old dress designer . Later Mr. Kravis divorced his first wife and married Miss Roehm , whom he had financially backed in her career . Her creations , which sell for up to $6 , 000 , aren ' t designed for just anybody . " It ' s a big love of mine to design for people who have a need to dress up in the evening , " she says . But then , neither are KKR investment pools designed for just anybody . Each investor must commit at least $20 million . " Investors in the Fund will be limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says the circular for the latest fund.  --  - HOW KKR AND PARTNERS HAVE FARED ( In million of dollars ) Table Total KKR Investment Company Buyout Year Cost* Investment** Status Storer Communications 1985 $2 , 408. 0 $200. 0 Still hold Union Texas Petroleum 1985 2 , 007. 0 250. 0 Still hold Pace Industries 1984 1 , 600. 0 190. 1 Still hold Wometco Enterprises 1984 1 , 075. 0 72. 7 Still hold Motel 6 1985 881. 0 126. 0 Still hold Malone &; Hyde 1984 708. 0 114. 6 Still hold Red Lion Inns 1985 600. 0 N.A.
