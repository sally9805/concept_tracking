In the Red Dog saloon in Juneau , the sawdust on the floor gets changed biweekly come fog , downpour or the occasional shard of sunlight . Behind the bar , there 's a bumper sticker that was temporarily stapled up last spring for laughs . It reads , GOD , PLEASE GIVE US ANOTHER BOOM . WE PROMISE NOT TO P THIS ONE AWAY . <P> A stiff hike up the hill from the Red Dog , nobody in the state capitol building sees anything to chuckle about . When Steve Cowper , the new Governor of the largest state in the union , looks out his third-floor window , his horizon does not stretch far enough to see another boom , or even a boomlet . What he sees is a budget deficit of $882 million and diminished prospects for the state 's heretofore pampered citizens . A man who favors cowboy boots and long silences , Cowper says sardonically , " It 's a four-year term unless they burn me out of the mansion . " Cowper idly contemplates that unhappy prospect because after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Alaska , went bust . <P> Overnight , it seems . Back in the early ' 80s , the state had so much oil money that State Representative Hoyt ( " Pappy " ) Moss proposed to bail out Chrysler , Cleveland and a couple of other basket cases in the Lower 48 . A few years before that , the legislators , in a gesture of unprecedented largesse , did away with the state income tax . In its place , they substituted a state- sponsored giveaway . Each and every resident was paid an annual " dividend " of some $500 merely for living in the state . The big spenders in Juneau also voted to give residents 65 and older an additional $250 each month as a longevity bonus . Says Cowper : " Government was in the business of dividing up the loot . " <P> When OPEC and oil prices went south , there were minicelebrations at gas pumps across the Lower 48 . In Alaska , as in Kuwait and Dubai , there were rude awakenings . Alaska derives a higher percentage ( 86% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other oil-producing state . As the price of a barrel of crude oil tumbled from the high 20s down through the teens to about $9 , the state began to run on empty . <P> Out in Bethel , a town scattered across the Kuskokwim River delta , there is apprehension about what budget cuts will mean . A region in western Alaska the size of Oregon , with about as many residents as Rutland , Vt. ( pop . 18,436 ) , the delta is representative of problems throughout the state . For example , the just completed $4 million Yukon-Kuskokwim youth correctional facility will probably never open its doors . There is no state money to operate it . " So much of our economy has been artificial , " says City Councilwoman Diane Carpenter , speaking of a generation of pork-barrel construction projects expensively built on pilings above the shifting permafrost . " Now that there are no jobs for young people , there will be social dislocation , anger and bitterness . " <P> Some of that dislocation will occur in the 56 villages for which Bethel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Yupik Indian who was born upriver in Kalskag , earned a doctorate at Stanford and now is the interim Bethel city manager , sees it coming . " The villages are going to feel it the most as teachers ' aides get cut . And 99% of them are native . " That will ripple back to Bethel . " Everything is one big question mark , " says Dave Foster , 46 , general manager of Swanson 's , the largest retail store in town . " I do n't think we 've seen the worst of it . "
