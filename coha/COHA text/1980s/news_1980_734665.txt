txt President Carter , we 're afraid , is dealing with the problem of undesirables among the Cuban refugees just as he has dealt with many controversies in the past . That is , he has issued a stern statement about it in response to popular feeling , evidently hoping that this will settle the matter . If it does n't , of course , he can make an equally resolute statement in a week or two saying something different . On Saturday , Mr. Carter ordered some 800 refugees sent back to Cuba . They included people with criminal pasts , plus 100 or so who staged a destructive riot at Ft . Chaffee , Ark. , last week to protest delays in finding homes for them . That seemed a firm and welcome action ; even Americans who welcomed the refugees were furious at the way they abused their hospitality . Mr. Carter 's ringing words , however , have not been followed by a plan of action ; in fact he himself does not seem quite sure what he meant by them . In practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be detained somewhere until the Castro government can be persuaded to let them come back , however long that may take . That is a feeble hope . The desperate , months-long exodus of some 112,000 Cubans from their homeland has disgraced Fidel Castro and his shoddy government ; about the only advantage he could get out of it was to palm off on the United States a number of criminals and misfits unwanted in Cuba or anywhere else . Since he has absolutely nothing else to boast about , this cheap littletriumph will have to be ballyhooed as a real achievement , and Mr. Castro wo n't want to be deprived of it . The question Mr. Carter has avoided will not go away : What exactly is to be done with the unwanted refugees who undoubtedly include Castro provocateurs ? The rioters can at least be charged under U. S. law , but what about those whose crimes were committed in Cuba , and are known to U. S. authorities only by hearsay ? Can they be imprisoned indefinitely just because we do n't know what else to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such plan out of the water . Since the administration does n't seem to have any ideas , we 'll suggest one : Send . these people to the U. S. base at Guantanamo and confine them , preferably near the border fence . They would the at least be on Cuban soil , and we would n't have to worry much about their escaping in fact , escapes over the fence might be tacitly encouraged . There is a certain offbeat logic to this . After all , the usual punishment for an escaped criminal is to send him back to prison with a lengthened term , and Cuba qualifies admirably for that purpose . The danger , we suppose , is that " free " Cubans watching through the fence while the detainees got three meals a day might break Into the Guantanamo base and join them . The plan is not , let us say , perfect . But until the Carter administration can come up with a better way of getting unwanted Cubans back to Cuba , it is somethina to think about .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
