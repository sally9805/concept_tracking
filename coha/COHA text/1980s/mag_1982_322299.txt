As the deadline nears , supporters mount last-gasp drives <P> With the June 30 cutoff for passage just three weeks away , the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution is still three states shy of the 38 needed for ratification . But supporters are not yet willing to call it quits . Heartened by a recent Harris poll showing that public support for passage has increased since January from 50% to 63% and a huge outpouring of money ( more than $ 1 million a month in contributions to the National Organization for Women since December ) , ERA activists have intensified their last-ditch push for ratification . Says NOW President Eleanor Smeal : " Women want to be equal and they refuse to believe that their country would vote that they are not . " <P> But ERA proponents were dealt a double blow in the Carolinas last week . In South Carolina the state legislature concluded its regular session without bringing the amendment to a vote . And in North Carolina , the state senate voted 27 to 23 to table the ERA , virtually eliminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrated in Oklahoma , Florida and Illinois . In Oklahoma , where a ratification resolution was voted down in January , ERA supporters have collected 25,000 signatures petitioning Governor George Nigh to convene a special legislative session to reconsider passage . Nigh has rejected a special session for the moment , but aides say he would call one if one or two more states ratify the amendment . <P> In Florida , Governor Robert Graham , an ERA supporter , will call a special session this month to take up the ERA . Hopes for belated ratification rose when the Florida supreme court ruled that all 40 state senators must face re-election this year because their districts were altered by a new reapportionment plan ; normally only 20 are up for re-election in a given year . The senate has been the main obstacle to the ERA 'S passage , rejecting it four times since 1972 . Says Gloria Sackman-Reed , Florida NOW coordinator : " Legislators are in the position now of voting against the amendment and then facing the voters three months later . It will be an issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the odds remain heavily against passage . Says State Senator Harry Johnston , an ERA supporter : " I do n't see anything yet that will change any votes around . " <P> Most immediate attention , however , is focused on Illinois , where ERA activists are pressuring legislators to make a rules change that would require only a simple majority rather than a three-fifths plurality to approve a constitutional amendment . Fasting and civil disobedience have become lobbying tactics . Last week 20 ardent ERA supporters chained themselves to the brass railing outside the senate chambers in Springfield , Ill . Said Mary Whitmore of Bellevue , Wash. : " These chains dramatize the economic slavery we are in . " <P> Seven other women , on a hunger strike since May 18 , sit in the capitol rotunda for three hours each day . One of the fasters , Sonia Johnson , 46 , who was excommunicated from the Mormon church for her support of the ERA , has been hospitalized twice for muscle spasms and an adverse drug reaction , and is in a wheelchair ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
