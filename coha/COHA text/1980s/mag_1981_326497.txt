Reactions to the tax bill range from delight to horror <P> " Something of a minor miracle , " said Michael Evans , a Washington , D.C. , economist . " Fiscal graffiti " and " a huge disaster " were the capsule descriptions offered by Economist Joseph Pechman of the Brookings Institution . Both men were referring to congressional approval last week of the Reagan-endorsed tax bill . Reaction to the program ranged from sheer delight to unspeakable horror ; business leaders were generally pleased , while angry labor chieftains charged that the program was a giveaway to the rich . <P> Compromised though it was by last-minute sweeteners designed to secure the votes of key Congressmen , the tax bill was essential to the Administration 's radical experiment in Reaganomics . The key question , of course , was whether it would work . Will it , as the Administration hopes , create more jobs , increase productivity and incentive , reduce inflation and make American industry more competitive in world markets ? Or will it , as critics charge , only make inflation worse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the rich richer and hurt the poor ? No one knows for sure , no more than anyone knew whether the equally controversial big spending , big deficit schemes of Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal would work when they were proposed in an earlier time of radical change . Some major provisions of the tax bill : <P> <P> The 25% Individual Tax Cut . This , the centerpiece of the program , will start showing up in the paychecks of 98 million working Americans after Oct. 1 , when federal withholding taxes will be reduced by 5% ; this will be followed by two more cuts of 10% each in July 1982 and July 1983 . The initial 5% cut will amount to only a few dollars for most individuals , but it will cost the Federal Treasury $25 billion during the first year . As further cuts kick in , the cost will rise to about $104 billion by 1984 . <P> Will that money go toward a massive national spending spree , driving up inflation as too many dollars chase too few goods ? Or will it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , given the certainty of three years of tax cuts , people will put away more than the 4.7% of earnings they now save . An increase of only 1% in the savings rate from U.S. personal income of $2.1 trillion would provide $21 billion in extra money for new plants and equipment , increase industrial output and jobs , making the economy grow . <P> But some critics have grave doubts that that will occur . One of them is Brookings ' Pechman , who says that the cut , together with all the other goodies tossed into the package , will only increase the federal budget deficit without contributing to increased productivity . Says Pechman : " The zeal to cut taxes is so great that they Congressmen do n't pay attention to the deficits . " Among businessmen there seems to be a consensus that the first small returns from the cut will be spent and not saved : they will , after all , appear in paychecks some time before Christmas , and some retailers are already preparing " tax cut special sales .
