By making the Soviets feel more vulnerable , the MX could derail arms control <P> President Reagan 's nationally televised speech last week was a tour de force . It is difficult to imagine a more effective , persuasive and reassuring presentation of his decision to pack the MX densely into a remote corner of Wyoming . He demonstrated something like perfect pitch in fine-tuning his appeal for support of the largest nuclear weapons system in American history and the simultaneous pursuit of deep reductions in the arsenals of the superpowers . But it will take more than rhetorical skills to dissolve the doubts that have been cast on the wisdom of the MX decision . In fact , the way in which the President sought to justify Dense Pack intensifies questions not only about this particular weapons program but about the Administration 's management of national security and arms control as a whole . <P> If , as the Administration maintains , the MX is absolutely vital to American safety-if we quite literally can not live without it-then why put a hundred of the missiles in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is supposed to solve , which is the vulnerability of American missiles to a Soviet preemptive first strike ? Asked this question on the eve of the President 's speech , an Administration official charged with helping to sell the program shrugged his shoulders and conceded that there was " something counterintuitive " about the concept . That is a fancy way of saying it defies common sense . Many experts suspect it does not make scientific sense either . <P> For years , viewers of the TV evening news have been treated to animated illustrations of ways that the Soviets might be able to destroy the MX in its various Rube Goldberg basing schemes , including this latest one . Designers of the various plans have responded that the Soviets could not be sure of knocking out all of the MXs . Therefore the existence of the MX would introduce a cautionary , salutary factor of uncertainty into Soviet calculations . Maybe so . But the same argument can be turned around . There is always some doubt about any new weapons system , especially a nuclear one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nuclear war . But with Dense Pack , the level of doubt is more than normal-and more than acceptable . Uncertainty on the American side about whether the MX could withstand and retaliate against a Soviet attack is just exactly what the U.S. does not need in its own defense planning .
