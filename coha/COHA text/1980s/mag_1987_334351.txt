Just try to avoid calcium these days . The miracle mineral of the moment , it is being added to everything from baking flour to bread , from orange juice to Tab . Meanwhile , such familiar products as milk and yogurt , as well as Tums and Total cereal , are being touted for their high calcium content . And calcium supplements are flooding the market , with sales of liquids and pills surging from $18 million in 1980 to $240 million last year . Those who gag on the tablets , which are huge gullet pluggers , can even try getting their mineral boost in a novel way  --  EZ-CAL Soft Calcium Whip , an aerosol can filled with calcium foam that was introduced in test markets last week . In short , just about anything consumable has been laced with the stuff . <P> The main propellant for the craze has been the presumption that calcium can ! help prevent osteoporosis , the degenerative bone disease that afflicts an estimated one-quarter of elderly men and half of elderly women in the U.S. Three years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advised Americans to increase their daily intake of calcium to 1,000 mg ( compared with the Government RDA of 800 mg ) ; the recommended level for postmenopausal women was an even higher 1,500 mg . Calcium fever soon swept the country . <P> Last week researchers , concerned by the commercial hype , met once again at NIH headquarters in Bethesda , Md . While reiterating their earlier counsel on daily intake , they sought to " bring calcium down a peg or two , " in the words of one , and to caution against unbridled enthusiasm . " Calcium is not a panacea for osteoporosis , " declares Washington University 's Dr. William Peck , who was a leader at both gatherings . " The ads promise more than calcium is going to deliver . " <P> In fact , both the disease and calcium 's role in bone development are still poorly understood . During normal youthful maturation the body readily absorbs calcium , which helps to build bigger and denser bones . After about age 35 , however , the process begins to reverse . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood , which needs the mineral for other organs , begins to leach it out of bones , leaving them weaker . Women suffer in particular because their bones are smaller and less dense than men 's . More important , for reasons that are not yet known , menopause speeds up bone loss . Osteoporosis is the excessive form of this natural process . <P> An extreme consequence is a bent frame and the so-called dowager 's hump . In Cincinnati , retired Registered Nurse Daisy Randle Smith , 76 , has a hump now , and despite wearing a brace , she has had spinal fractures in nine of the past ten years ; one fracture was caused by a slight sneeze . " I 'm in pain most of the time , " she says , " and I 've lost 5 1/2 inches since 1977 . " The loss of height is irreversible , as is the brittleness . Fractures like Smith 's are common  --  1.2 million occur in the U.S. each year . Almost half are to spinal vertebrae , and one-fifth involve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those with hip fractures die within six months .
