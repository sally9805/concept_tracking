" Undecorated decorating " is how William Diamond , a New York interior designer , describes the process he and his associate William Baratta went through when they renovated an old bungalow in upstate New York for Kim and Michael Schwartz . " The biggest mistake would have been to do too much , " he said . " What the Schwartzes wanted was really a kind of grown-up summer camp. " // Which is exactly what he designed . In the tradition of camp living , a commodious screen porch 50 feet long was placed along the front facade . It is definitely the summer living room . " Michael can play Ping-Pong , I can read and Nina can ride her tricycle here , " Mrs. Schwartz said. // " All we wanted was a very simple house , " said Mr. Schwartz , " Although the process was a lot more complicated than I ever dreamed it would be . " Indeed , Mr. Diamond did renovate the bungalow from stem to stern , and the results are exactly the comfortable and carefree style that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Diamond used a wood-block dining table and early 1950 ' s chairs in the kitchen dining area . The white-painted furniture in the living room and on the porch are a rattan , 1920 ' s-style sofa and chairs , which he designed for Bielecky Brothers , and an old Alvar Aalto dining table that has been cut down to coffee-table height . In the front hall there is a maid ' s room dresser bought at auction , a brass bed is in the master bedroom and 1920 ' s flowered wallpaper covers the walls of the entrance hall . In addition , Mr. Diamond had all the architectural details - wainscoting , moldings and doors - custom made with a 1920 ' s flavor . Even the bathroom has a period flavor , with a pair of old-fashioned pedestal sinks placed side-by-side . And all the floors , including the porch , are painted with dark green enamel. // Achieving this rustic look sometimes means doing almost nothing . Gary Hager , a designer with Parish-Hadley , admits he found it hard not to tamper with the Hamptons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The biggest challenge was not to do it up , " Mr. Hager said . " To tart up this house would have been to destroy it . " So the rustic World War I army barracks , tucked into the dunes , looks very much as it did in the 1930 ' s when it was moved by barge from Delaware . Although shingled siding was added at the time of the move , the shacklike feeling of the building is evident inside and out. // Mr. Hager ' s house is basically one large square room , 40 by 40 feet , with four tiny bedrooms in each of the corners . Twenty-seven-foot-high raftered ceilings in the main room could easily seem cavernous , but because a large portion is a skylight , the unfinished wood walls are bathed in sun most of the day . " The skylight suggests that this house once belonged to a sculptress , " Mr. Hager said . Several sculpture stands were left. // Because of its size the room had to be carefully organized . " The right things had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He divided the space into several separate areas : a seating group of Adirondack and rattan chairs around the fireplace for chilly evenings , an entertainment center including a Ping-Pong table , stereo and bookshelves , and a dining area with picnic table. // The kitchen , near the entrance to the house , is simplicity itself : open wood shelves and vintage equipment . In fact , the house has been left fairly much as Mr. Hager found it . " The biggest expense was for a few comfortable beds , " Mr. Hager explained . " Many of the pieces are rustic carpenter-built objects made as they were needed , " he said. // The few touches the designer added were inexpensive : straw rugs , hurricane lamps and 1920 ' s Indian blankets slung over sofas and chairs. // If Mr. Hager found his house full of the relics of past tenants , the Schwartzes found a totally unlivable shell . In fact , the cottage was such a shambles they briefly considered tearing it down and starting from scratch . " It went beyond gutting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first renovation , one addition had been bought from a Sears catalogue 50 years ago. " // The tiny bungalow had cramped , dark rooms that faced away from the view . " By adding the screen porch and one large room , we literally doubled the size of the house , " Mr. Baratta said. // The two new additions made the bungalow into a 2 , 000-square-foot house and the large new room became the kitchen , dining and living area . With an open peaked roof and a large round window rescued from a Vermont church , the room is a generous 18 by 30 feet , with a ceiling that reaches 24 feet high . The uncomplicated kitchen area has butcher-block counters , a Formica work island and plain glass-front cabinets . The former living room became the Schwartzes ' master bedroom . The old kitchen is now the room of their 3-year-old daughter , Nina . Mr. Diamond also broke through a portion of the attic in the master bathroom to create 11-foot-high ceilings and install transom windows , so most rooms have a view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s backyard and he has only a small back porch furnished with Adirondack chairs . Like the Schwartzes , he appreciates the casual way of life that his shack provides . " The best part is that there ' s absolutely no upkeep , " he said . " The less you do the more gracefully the house ages. " //
