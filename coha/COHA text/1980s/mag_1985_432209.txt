 | Margaret Thatcher once told an audience of 5,000 women , " If you want something said , ask a man . If you want something done , ask a woman . " The room broke into thunderous applause . Millions of Britons , male and female , must agree with Mrs. Thatcher 's analysis , for in June 1983 she was overwhelmingly voted into a second term of office as Britain 's first woman prime minister . And today , almost two years later ? despite mounting problems of unemployment and the crippling cost of a bitter coal miners ' strike ? her personal popularity with the people still appears stronger than that of any potential rival . Just who is Margaret Thatcher ? Is she the " Iron Lady " the Russian news agency Tass once dubbed her ? ( And to which Mrs. Thatcher retorted , " They were right . Britain needs an Iron Lady . " ) In part , she is . But this 59-yearold wife and mother is by no means just the cold politician such a term implies . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thatcher was receiving report after report of ships being sunk and lives being lost , she wept ? and she admitted it . " You ca n't help it , " she commented ,  | " but you pull yourself together very quickly . " Her outbursts of temper can be strong , but her stomach quakes at the prospect of telling an employee that he 's fired . She works her staff very hard , but after keeping her chauffeur out for a late-night engagement , she has given him flowers to take home to his wife , along with her personal apologies . And no visitor walks into her office without being asked , " Have you eaten ? Would you like some tea ? " To know who Margaret Hilda Thatcher is , you have to return to her roots . She was born on October 13 , 1925 , in a room above her parents ' grocery shop in Grantham , a small town about 100 miles from London . She was the second daughter of Alfred and Beatrice Roberts , who ran both their shop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devout Methodists who saw to it their children attended church four times on Sundays . Margaret and her elder sister , Muriel , did not have an easy childhood . They had few toys ? even when Alfred 's business expanded and he could have afforded some luxuries . Rather , they were taught that thrift was a virtue to be admired and generosity was reserved for those less well off . Margaret 's mother , a trained dressmaker , was a gentle woman who taught her daughters to make their own clothes and cook plain meals . She also encouraged Margaret in her piano lessons , to an extent that she reached a near-professional level . But it was their father who really guided them . Alfred , who had been forced to leave school at 13 , had great ambitions for his daughters , particularly for Margaret . Because he wanted them to have the education he never had , he forced them to concentrate on learning almost to the exclusion of all else . When Margaret questioned her father about why other girls could go out to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do things or want to do things just because other people do them . Make up your mind about what you are going to do , and persuade people to go your way . " It is advice that she has always followed . At school Margaret was diligent though not brilliant . The activity she enjoyed most was the school debating society , where she could be counted on to speak on nearly any subject . She knew far more about what was going on in the outside world than any of her classmates , most of whom apparently found Margaret Roberts a bit of a bore . For her part Margaret thought girls her age giggled too much . All Margaret 's hard work at school paid off when she achieved her next goal : a place at Oxford . She approached the famous university with some trepidation . Her father arranged for her to have speech lessons , while she worried ? as she still does ? about her clothes . At college , as at school , Margaret did not make any lasting friendships but immersed herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and during one of her vacations she took a job teaching chemistry . She approached it as she still approaches everything ? with determination . " I used to go on until I knew they 'd got it . " While at Oxford Margaret became interested in politics , joined the University Conservative Association , and was eventually elected president . Although she denies that she had ambitions at that time to become a Member of Parliament , Mrs. Thatcher 's future path seemed clear ? but she knew that , as a woman , she would find it difficult to be given a chance in a political world very much dominated by men . After graduating Oxford , Margaret found work first with a plastics firm then as a research chemist in London . Her new job was not far from the town of Dartford , Kent , where she had been nominated as the Conservative Party candidate for Parliament . ( In Britain , unlike the United States , candidates for Parliament need not reside in the districts they represent . ) She was not only the only woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age 24 , the youngest woman candidate in the country . Dartford , however , was a Labor Party stronghold , so no one was too surprised when Margaret was defeated . At least she found happiness in another direction : On the night she was nominated as the candidate , a stranger offered her a lift back to London . His name was Denis Thatcher . Tall , good-looking , well-established as head of his family 's paint and wallpaper business , and a fellow Methodist , Denis appeared to Margaret 's ever sensible mind a very good choice of husband , especially since , as it soon became clear , they were greatly taken with one another . There was really only one potential problem : Denis had been married before , and although there was no suggestion of Margaret 's having been involved in the breakup of his marriage , at that time the Methodist church in England strongly disapproved of divorce . For perhaps the only time in her life Margaret went against the strict tenets she had been brought up to believe in and , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapel , City Road , London . She wore a long dress of sapphire-blue velvet ? " it was deep winter and I was n't going to be cold " ? and a feathered hat that someone later remarked looked like " regurgitated ostrich plumage . " Denis and Margaret Thatcher set the pattern for their married life right from the start ? work would always be prominent and each career would be equal . Even on their honeymoon ? in Portugal , Madeira , and Paris ? Denis sneaked in a few business meetings . Margaret does not appear to have minded . And when they settled in London , Denis , in turn , encouraged Margaret 's ambition to become a lawyer as an adjunct to her political career . It was a time of change in Britain . Queen Elizabeth II was soon to be crowned in Westminster Abbey . Under the title " Wake Up , Women , " Margaret Thatcher wrote a newspaper article that began : If , as many pray , the accesSion of Elizabeth II can help to remove the last shreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new era for women will indeed he at hand . I hope we will see more and  | more women combining marriage and a career ... . Margaret 's own life was developing in many directions . At the same time she was studying law , she became pregnant , and in August 1953 she gave birth not lust to the one baby she was expecting but to twins ! The overjoyed parents named their children Mark and Carol . Margaret was taking her final law examinations the following December , so the family hired a nanny , who ended up staying with them until Mark and Carol were eight . At that time , like many English children from well-off families , they left for boarding school . Although Margaret was not the sort of mother to get down on the carpet and play with her children , she did dote on them and fuss over them . With memories of her own strict childhood vivid in her mind , she also tried to give her children as much freedom to enjoy themselves as possible . " My father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had missed , " she explained . " Because my children had the education , I tried to give them a little more fun . " She set aside times to play with her children , gave small dinner parties for her husband 's business associates , and always got up to make Denis ' breakfast , even if she had been out very late at a political meeting . " Margaret decides what she has to do and how she wants to do it . " Denis once explained to a friend , " and then she either gets up very early or works very late in order to get everything prepared . It 's this singleness of purpose that comes through in everything she does . " After five futile attempts Mrs. Thatcher finally succeeded in getting elected to Parliament in October 1959 ? just five days before her thirty-fourth birthday . Twins Mark and Carol were six . From then onward , they saw less of their mother , but they learned from her to make their own life . Sometimes they would be invited to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a farmer in Essex . Apart from the slower tempo at their aunt and uncle 's home , one of the things the twins liked best was simply sitting down to meals as a family , something that was never easy to arrange in the Thatcher family . Just two years after entering Parliament , Mrs. Thatcher was given her first junior post in the government , as Parliamentary Secretary at the Ministry of Pensions . Sadly , her mother , ill with cancer , died without seeing her daughter achieve this first step to political power . Ten years later , in 1971. her father also died just a few months before Margaret achieved another important step : She became only the second woman in the history of the Conservative Party to be appointed as a full member of the Cabinet ? Secretary of State for Education . In those days Margaret 's conservative ideas were disliked by practically everyone . As an economy measure , her Ministry of Education put a stop to free milk in schools , and she was dubbed " Thatcher the Snatcher " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be deeply hurt by personal criticism , attacks on her policies usually make her dig her heels in all the harder . She is always backed up by her family . Denis in particular , although they rarely talk politics . Denis , who is happy to go to any of his wife 's functions , made it clear from the start that he never wanted to become involved in politics himself . He was much more interested in sports . Although they have always appeared quite compatible , Margaret and Denis are not at all alike , even in their habits . Denis smokes . Margaret does n't ? and strongly disapproves of the habit . She will make a whiskey and soda last all evening , whereas Denis is known to like to drink more than that . But in a crisis ? or a triumph ? Denis is always the person Margaret turns to . Margaret did not consult her family when , in 1975 , she decided to challenge  | Edward Heath for the leadership of the Conservative Party . If she won the position , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister in the next election . Her decision to challenge Heath grew out of her feeling that , " There did n't seem to be anyone who had the thoughts and ideas I had . " Her political beliefs are illustrated by some lines of Abraham Lincoln , which she still carries with her in her handbag : " You can not bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift , " and , " You can not strengthen the weak by weakening the strong . " Mrs. Thatcher won by a handsome majority , and it was years before Mr. Heath , her old boss , could bring himself to mention her name in public . Now , as her party 's candidate for prime minister , she had to win the approval of the voters , most of whom knew little about her other than that she looked and sounded prim . Her image had to be softened ? without damaging her strong policies . Experiments were made with restyling her hair ? at one time she wore it in an unflattering beehive ? but the greatest problem was her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Oxford had " corrected " her regional accent , but her voice now had a haughty shrillness . By careful practice she learned to speak in a lower pitch and to stand closer to the microphone to achieve a more intimate sound . Later , capped teeth completed the " remodeling . " Although Mrs. Thatcher 's appearance matters very much to her ( " I do believe that if you look good , people warm to you , " she has said ) , she has always felt uncomfortable about being sold to the voters as a " personality . " Still , the soft-selling of Margaret Thatcher as a " warm human being " undoubtedly helped her win the 1979 general election and become the first woman prime minister in British history . The fact that she is a woman also helped her . Britain was ready for a change , and what change could be greater than putting a woman in charge ? Many people had come to think of " Maggie " as a nanny or strict aunt who would knock the country back into shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the famed residence of the British prime minister . Denis was officially retired ( he had sold his company ) , but " he ca n't retire , " said his wife . As a result , he has joined the boards of two other companies , and is also an avid golfer . " They say I am the most shadowy husband of all time , " he once told reporters . " I intend to stay that way and leave the limelight to my wife . " The children have had a more difficult time with their mother 's fame . While still a college student , when her mother was not yet prime minister , Carol found the strain of being Margaret Thatcher 's daughter too great and went to live in Australia . She did not return until 1981 , two years after her mother 's election , and since then has worked out a better understanding with her mother . A journalist , she is currently collaborating on a biography of tennis 's most famous couple , Chris Evert and John Lloyd . Mark appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place at Oxford , causing Mrs. Thatcher to comment sadly , " University ? undreamed of for my father . My dream . My son 's refusal . All in three generations . " Then , after failing accountancy exams , Mark has been a not very successful race-car driver and male model . He now lives in the United States much of the time , where he has been the American representative for the Lotus car company . While Margaret is proud of her daughter 's achievements and independence , she has always had a soft spot for Mark . The only time she has ever been seen to weep in public was when her son was missing for several days in the Sahara Desert while taking part in a car rally . Margaret Thatcher has now been prime minister for six years , and with each passing year her confidence in herself as a world leader has increased . It is perhaps inevitable . therefore , that comparisons would be made between her and the Queen . Although they are approximately the same age , the backgrounds and interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The qualities they do share are an almost obsessive dedication to duty and a very real love of family . When Mark Thatcher was missing in the Sahara , the Queen personally telephoned Mrs. Thatcher seeking news . And when Prince Andrew was in the thick of the Falklands War as a Naval helicopter pilot , Mrs. Thatcher made sure the Queen was kept up to date with the very latest news about her son . Argentina 's invasion of the Britishadministered Falkland Islands in April 1982 and Margaret Thatcher 's determination to meet force with force led to much criticism both in Britain and elsewhere . But the final surrender of the Argentinians some two-and-a-half months later undoubtedly helped Mrs. Thatcher to win the 1983 general election and secure her place as prime minister . Whatever the rights and wrongs of the conflict , Mrs. Thatcher had demonstrated that she was not one to ever give in . Similarly , the IRA 's attempt to assassinate her last September - by planting a bomb in the Brighton hotel where she and most of the members of the Conservative Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind her for a time . Mrs. Thatcher and her husband escaped injury only by inches in an explosion so powerful five people were killed , dozens injured , and five stories of the hotel destroyed . Has her close brush with death altered Mrs. Thatcher 's attitude toward life ? " Oh yes , " she replied in an interview we held shortly after the bombing incident . " Life is infinitely more precious to me now . When something like that happens , it alters your perspective . You 're not going to be worried or complain about silly little things anymore . " Was she going to change her mind about the big things , too ? I asked Mrs. Thatcher . " No , " she replied firmly , her face taking on its familiar look of conviction . " You try to do the right thing about the big things in any event . And you just go on doing the right thing . " And that is who Margaret Thatcher is ? a woman who has always tried to do what she thought was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world as she was doing it .
