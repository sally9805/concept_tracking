While the mighty exporters of Japan and Western Europe draw most of the attention , about one-quarter of the U.S. trade deficit is the work of a pesky group of second-tier nations known as the newly industrialized countries . Once dismissed as marginal producers of chintzy clothes and toys , the NICs , which include South Korea , Singapore , Hong Kong , Taiwan , Mexico and Brazil , have gone upscale , producing everything from VCRs and computers to cars and commuter planes . By importing technology and deploying armies of low-paid but often well-educated workers , the NICs have been able to undercut competitors ' prices in markets all over the world . From 1980 to 1986 , NIC exports jumped 56% , to $175 billion . <P> Such a pace will not be easy to sustain , however . Mexico and Brazil are overburdened by debts that threaten to crush their economies and throttle their ability to export . Even the stronger Asian NICs face perils ranging from political unrest at home to protectionist barriers abroad . <P> None of the other NICs has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has directed the growth of such huge industrial conglomerates as Hyundai and Daewoo , which manufacture cars , computers and other high-tech goods . Following the example of the giant Japanese manufacturers , the Korean companies have launched a determined U.S. invasion . Hyundai 's subcompact Excel , which reached American shores last year , is the hottest-selling new imported auto in history . This summer , General Motors started selling small Daewoo cars under the Pontiac LeMans nameplate . <P> While scoring business triumphs , Korea has been racked by political and social unrest for much of the year . In the summer , massive and violent street demonstrations forced Korean President Chun Doo Hwan to speed up the process of democratic reform . Then a series of strikes temporarily shut down virtually all major Korean companies and many minor ones as workers demanded  --  and won  --  higher wages . Amid the turmoil , the Korean economy has proved resilient ; growth for the year is expected to be 12% . <P> In contrast to Korea 's large corporations , Taiwan 's companies , which churn out products as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they make big waves in world trade . With the U.S. alone , Taiwan piled up a $16 billion surplus last year . That has stirred anger in Washington , which has forced Taiwan to raise the value of its currency , and is threatening protectionist retaliation because the country keeps its domestic market closed to U.S. imports . <P> Hong Kong , which has perhaps the most freewheeling economy in the world , readily lets in imports and ships out exports like stylish clothing just as fast . Despite uncertainty about what will happen to the former British colony when China assumes sovereignty in 1997 , business confidence is strong and economic growth is expected to reach 12% this year . Leaving many high-tech fields to the other NICs , Hong Kong is concentrating on being a financial center . Virtually all the world 's major banks have offices there . Hong Kong is also developing its role as the gateway to the largest potential market in the world : China .                 @ @ @ @
