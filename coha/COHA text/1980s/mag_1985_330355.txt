On the climb to middle-class acceptance , the Valenzuelas have all their tickets punched , save one . They own a growing used-tire shop and two cars . They rent a tidy , three-bedroom home in Los Angeles ' San Fernando Valley . Their four children maintain B averages in public schools . They pay Social Security and income taxes and keep a clean credit rating . All the family lacks is permission to live in America . <P> The Valenzuelas entered illegally from Mexico , chasing their American dream through a hole in the border fence near Tijuana on a moonless autumn night almost ten years ago . In contrast to the popular image of transient workers cowering in fear of deportation , they are among a burgeoning number of illegal families who have sunk deep roots in hospitable American soil . They are granted nudge-and-a-wink acceptance by employers as well as government agencies . <P> After arriving in the U.S. , Agustin ( now just " Gus " ) Valenzuela , 40 , held a variety of farm and factory jobs . " Nobody ever asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit , " he says , " just a Social Security number . " Like most illegals , Valenzuela simply made up a number . ( He was later able to get a legitimate number after applying for legal residency . ) He was caught once by the INS while packing coleslaw in central Los Angeles and was bused across the border , but he sneaked back through the fence in time for work the next morning . <P> Valenzuela feels more secure now that he is working for himself , in a shop that he built from scrap lumber . He got a permit to sell used tires from a local policeman who knows the Valenzuelas are illegal . The officer assured the family that they can report crimes without fear of exposure . Los Angeles Police Commander William Booth explains , " If someone is a victim of crime , we need to know about it , and it 's not our policy to inquire about their status . " <P> Many state and local agencies take a similar approach . Both Valenzuela and his wife Elvira , 38 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth certificates and by passing a driving test and a written examination in Spanish . When the Valenzuelas registered their cars they needed no immigration documents . The same was true when they borrowed money from a major California bank , first to buy a car and later to nurture their business . " Anybody asks , I just say ' American citizen , ' and I show them my driver 's license and Social Security card , " Valenzuela says . <P> The couple have three Mexican-born children and one , Enriqueta , who gained her coveted American citizenship the most direct way : born in the U.S.A. After her birth in 1977 , Valenzuela filed a residency application , which is still pending . Such long waits are common . The Valenzuela children were enrolled in the Los Angeles public schools without any inquiry into their immigration status . After school , the boys , Ricardo , 16 , and Jorge , 15 , work in the family business , changing and repairing tires , while Leticia , 14 , helps keep the books . The girls also do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisted her back five years ago while lifting boxes at a local garment factory . Workmen 's compensation paid for surgery on her spine , and her resident 's status was never at issue .
