The Lindblad Polaris , a ship with a cozy capacity of 70 people , has a draft so shallow it can penetrate regions some other cruise ships can not . The Polaris even hauls rafts for venturing up narrow creeks and in between small islands. // I joined up with the company ' s ' ' West African Seafari , ' ' an 18-day voyage that started in Senegal , wove through the Bijagos Archipelago of Guinea-Bissau , then moved deep into the Gambia River. // // Although life aboard Polaris is organized and very comfortable , what happens beyond the gangplank can be unpredictable and physically wearing . The naturalness and serendipity of these journeys make for an appealing alternative to the well-rehearsed tours and international shopping sprees offered on many cruise lines . By avoiding the beaten track , this company tends to turn its passengers into pioneers . If you shrink in the face of trailblazing or if you are uncomfortable with a cruise itinerary likely to change in the face of unforeseen dilemmas or opportunities , you should look for another travel outfit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wilderness ) , step right up. // We are halfway up the Gambia River , well beyond the mangrove swamps and Alex Haley ' s ancestral village of Juffure . Bruce , our venturesome tour director , is briefing us on our coming excursion to Simenti , a little-known wildlife lodge in Senegal ' s Niokola-Koba National Park. // ' ' Just to set the scene , ' ' he begins , loosening the purple bandanna tied around his tanned neck , ' ' we ' re going to take a route not taken by other tourist groups . In fact , we ' ve never tried it ourselves . Actually , we don ' t know what we ' ll find. . . . ' ' // Nine days into our Seafari , we take such qualifiers in stride . After all , we have been conditioned to expect the unexpected . Some of us spent an adventurous , if unscheduled , night stranded under an awesome sea of stars on the balmy shores of an isolated isle known as Bubaque . On the gorgeous white beach of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbecue and blazing bonfire . In Gambia ' s nature reserve , a chimpanzee leaped into my arms and kissed me smack on the lips . And only a few days ago , a dozen of us had the accidental pleasure of happening into the daily life of a primitive Balante village , simply because we missed the Rio Mansoa ferry , which was to have taken us somewhere else. // So when Bruce announces , ' ' We ' re heading to the most remote part of Senegal , ' ' and when the ship ' s cultural historian inserts , ' ' Even most Senegalese haven ' t been there , ' ' we passengers smile confidently , as if affirming , ' ' We ' re up to that . ' ' Bruce tells us we will leave before dawn , make our way upriver in rafts to the backwater village of Wallikunda , then travel four to five hours overland to Niokola-Koba. // At 6 : 15 a. m. , sky and river are both a muted indigo . As we travel in the rafts , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circle of halos around us . Turtledoves coo overhead , winging through a breeze that smells like gardenias . Greatly contented , we drag our hands in the cool water - until we remember the hippos and crocodiles underneath. // When we reach Wallikunda at 8 : 30 , the sun is up and beaming down on the vehicles that await us : a white minibus , a blue van , and an old Swiss Army truck with a tattered , bamboo roof . The truck is pine green with a cow skull , horns , and gourds dangling like charms from its grill . Fourteen of us climb eagerly into its open-air rear . The rest of our group steps into the van or bus. // At 9 a. m. the truck leads our small caravan out of Wallikunda - past barefoot women who walk like queens with calabashes of water on their heads , past children romping under a silk cotton tree that spills angel-hair seeds around its enormous trunk. // We are on Gambia ' s southern road , which stretches from the capital city , Banjul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the east . The hues of the flat landscape on both sides of the narrow tarmac are muted by the haze of Sahara sand that blows south this time of year . A gritty breeze fingers our hair and irritates our eyes , but we are too happy with anticipation to notice . Eddie Brewer , Gambia ' s director of wildlife and conservation , deftly names all the birds , flora , and fauna within view. // Around 10 : 30 the blacktop road has turned to dirt , and the wind blowing through the open sides of our truck is a relentless 110 degrees F.We haven ' t sighted the van or bus in half an hour . Bruce signals the driver to park in the sporadic shade of a baobob tree and wait for the others to catch up. // An hour later we are still waiting , and our driver comments , ' ' They must not have taken the shortcut that we took . ' ' ' ' What short cut ? ' ' asks Bruce , pulling out his map . The driver assures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don ' t seem to be on the map . We climb back in the truck , and some positive-minded passenger comments , ' ' We ' re gon na end up somewhere , that ' s for sure ! ' ' // At the hour we were to have reached Simenti , we come instead to a tiny village with streets so narrow we nearly knock down the grass fences as we round the corners . Scrawny goats hug the fences for an inch or two of high-noon shade . Children applaud and shout as we trundle by . Older people rise from their siesta mats to call , ' ' How are you ? ' ' to which Bruce responds , ' ' Where are we ' ' // By 2 p. m. , we ' ve passed two other wee villages and are still confounded as to our whereabouts . With sun hats and dust-coated faces , we look like an overworked crew of migrant workers . Suddenly in the middle of nowhere , we come upon our cohorts , who are parked by the roadside and groaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve been waiting . We outgroan them as they hand us our share of the cheese sandwich emergency rations . They surprise us with news that we ' ve already crossed into Senegal . Finally we all take off for the last leg of our journey - our truck in the rear this time. // When we enter Niokola-Koba at 5 p. m. , we are a truckload of worn and weary grumblers . But when we reach Simenti half an hour later , forgiveness is in the making . This rustic lodge , blessed with a cool , blue swimming pool , sits miragelike in between a green flood plain , replete with wildlife and a sandy bend of the Gambia River where hippos bathe . By nightfall , contentment sets in . After a night of sparse but sufficient accommodations , we rise early for our first game run . Despite the presence of large game , it is a curious , bald bird that captures everyone ' s attention . Ornithologist Peter Alden , who often sails with the Polaris , spotted the bald ibis standing among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black Victorian ruff around its bare pink head , it ' s an extremely rare bird apparently more off course than we were yesterday . It had never been reported in Senegal before. // The ibis is but one of many firsts on this trip . One night in the fishing and rice-cultivating village of Bombali , we danced in the dust with villagers under a 10-story-tall kapok tree . In the River Gambia National Park , usually off limits to the public , Eddie Brewer introduced us to chimps in the world ' s only Chimpanzee Rehabilitation Project - a kind of ' ' Outward Bound ' ' school for chimps that have lived in captivity and lost their wilderness skills . After gaining sufficient survival savvy , they are set free. // We ventured to the island of Bubaque , where money doesn ' t exist and matriarchy is the rule . Celebrating the post harvest season , Bubaquian men donned elaborate costumes made of seeds , grass , bark , wood , and bone and danced for villagers from afternoon until deep into the night. // Before visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native culture , and they ' re given lectures on this subject and some lessons in travel etiquette . For example , former Peace Corps volunteer Paul Greenspan , who was on board , offered hints on how to dress appropriately in Muslim countries . He chided us about cultural insensitivity by asking , ' ' How would you feel if 50 Africans came into your home and took pictures of your grandmother in bed ? ' ' // To avoid the social upheavals that can be caused by even well-meaning tourists , every Polaris passenger is asked to give friendship rather than money or things to the people they meet . And in each village visited , a ship representative presents an appropriate gift through traditional channels for the villagers to share. // If you believe that a close look at other ways of life enriches one ' s own existence , or if you simply like adventure , you will enjoy journeying on the Lindblad Polaris . These cruises , however , are not cheap - the West African Seafari was about $5 , 000 per person , excluding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Senegal , where the cruise begins and ends , is available through Air Afrique , offering round-trip flights from New York twice a week . Stewardesses in traditional African dresses provide excellent service , and African music flows out of the earphones .
