They happen to be the colors of the French flag as well. // The coincidence is appropriate and becoming . American by birth and education - and for the past eight years French by palate and address - Ms. Wells is the author of ' ' The Food Lover ' s Guide to France ' ' ( Workman , $14. 95. ) , a follow-up to her ' ' Food Lover ' s Guide to Paris. ' ' // // The hefty paperback is two pounds of thinly sliced , sweet and savory French gastronomic delicacies and delights , and where to find them . And not just recipes , but also restaurants. // Through these pages Patricia Wells takes you by the arm , moving you quickly through the heady fish stalls in Marseille , introduces you to her favorite cheesemakers , and points you up a side street to the best olive oil cooperative in Provence . Included , too , are the locations , times , and dates of outdoor , flower , and flea markets and a variety of fairs and festivals along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truffles are buried ! // Way back in third grade in Wauwatosa , Wis. , little Patricia ' s teacher asked what she wanted to do when she grew up . ' ' Journalist , ' ' she scribbled on the blackboard . With that decided , Wells went on to get a master ' s degree in journalism ; reviewed art at the Washington Post , and finally worked at the New York Times as editor of the paper ' s culture desk. // With a blue pencil in one hand , she still kept a finger in the pie. // ' ' All along I became known as ' someone who liked to cook . ' I was always , always , always crazy about cooking , ' ' she emphasizes , folding her white sunglasses and returning them to her purse. // At the Times , two dreams came true . She met and married her second husband , Walter Wells ( ' ' He ' s just wonderful , ' ' she coos , ' ' and a wonderful cook , too ' ' ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Times needed a food writer for their new Living section , and I thought it would be a way to get my foot in the door as a reporter. ' ' // Only one problem : ' ' OK , ' ' they told her , ' ' you can have the job , but you can ' t be a vegetarian anymore. ' ' // ' ' Now , Walter refers to me as a lapsed Roman Catholic and a non-practicing vegetarian , ' ' Wells says with a laugh. // In ' 79 , her husband was offered a job as news editor of the International Herald Tribune in Paris. // ' ' We decided to go for two years , ' ' Wells muses . ' ' At the end of two years we looked at each other and said , ' We ' re not ready to go back yet ! ' It took us two years before we could sit at a dinner table and make conversation in French. ' ' // From the start , Wells collected and tested recipes and reviewed food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuisine and Food and Leisure magazines , and at the same time served as restaurant critic of the International Herald Tribune. // The best of what she has tasted , tested , and tried is stuffed within her Food Lover ' s Guides. // Much of her research was done with an assistant who acted as navigator as Wells drove through each and every province in France. // The top restaurants , she admits , were saved for her and Walter alone. // ' ' We ' d go off on what we called ' petit fours weekends . ' Any restaurant that gave petits fours we considered ' fancy . ' We did a few trips like that. ' ' // Most , though , were with her navigator-assistant , while Wells did the driving . ' ' Sometimes what was billed as a ' great bistro ' turned out to be nothing more than a Coke stand , ' ' she moans. // Does she have a favorite region in France ? // ' ' Provence . Unequivocally my favorite . We have a beautiful country house there. ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a least-favorite . ' ' I never really hooked into Burgundy . I don ' t know why . The other provinces seem to have so much folklore and history . . . I guess I just don ' t get the message , ' ' she says with a shrug. // The region that surprised her most was Brittany : ' ' The food is so simple and the fish is incredible . Super-fresh ! Tiny Belon oysters and grilled lobster . It really surprised me. ' ' // In spite of eating her way through the French countryside , Wells stays surprisingly fit. // ' ' That ' s because I never eat breakfast , ' ' she says . ' ' Morning is the only time of the day when I don ' t even think of food. ' ' // Jogging every day helps too , she admits. // Wells is now working on a bistro guide to France and updating her Paris guide , while continuing to taste and test along the way. // The advice she gives to real food lovers is what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ' regionality , ' ' ' she says . ' ' Everyone comes to France with a list of the three-star restaurants . That ' s fine . Everyone wants a ' grand buffe ' - a ' big deal ' in Paris - and that ' s wonderful . Save that for your last night in Paris . But get out in the country and find the real cuisine . Get off the main roads onto the quiet departement roads . That ' s where you ' ll discover regional foods. ' ' // Wells ' s file cabinets are bursting with recipes and leads on restaurants . But it ' s the people that she collects along the way that really stick in her mind. // ' ' I ' m always looking for the ' little guy ' - the last man who makes walnut oil in the country . And the little woman who is still making cheese in a copper pot . If I can ' t do anything to save these ( traditions ) , I hope at least I ' m documenting them. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food consumers and producers : a homogenization of taste. // ' ' There is no question that people are moving toward blander food , ' ' says Wells . ' ' And many people making , say , olive oil , tend to produce a more bland oil to appeal to that growing market. // ' ' Fewer and fewer people know what good food tastes like , and , correspondingly , how to prepare it . We tend to think all French people have great palates and taste . Well , they all don ' t. ' ' // Regardless , touring France nonstop , discovering the very best that still exists in the unexpected bistro , out-of-the-way cafe , and remote farmhouse , searching for the smoothest foie gras , the perfect bouillabaisse , and the creamiest Beaufort cheese sounds the most idyllic job conceivable for anyone who knows a canard from a Camembert. // But life isn ' t always just a bowl of cherries avec creme fraise for a food critic. // ' ' Ever since the books came out , we get calls from perfect strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Wells says between bites of Lobster Souffle at the Plaza Athenee. // ' ' I ' ve thought of putting on my answering machine , ' Hello , this is Patricia Wells , The restaurant of the week is . . .
