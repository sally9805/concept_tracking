A moment before , I had come around the point into the marshy shallows . Through the wisps of early morning mist that rose from the lily pads , I had noticed a movement in the bushes . But there was no hint of wind in the Maine sky : The water lay smooth and pearly , like the inside of a mussel shell . So I let the canoe drift and peered , Moses-like , at the bushes , trying to puzzle out the cause of the sudden tuggings and snappings among the leaves . Now and then a paw emerged . Here and there , past gaps in the natural hedge , a banded tail flitted past . And at last , as though assembled into a whole by a force beyond us both , the entire animal appeared near a piece of driftwood . Thirty yards away , my canoe creaked gently against some reeds . We both froze - I with the paddle across the gunwales , he with a forefoot on the log. // // One can pass a lot of time watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially in a country conceived as a frontier and dedicated to the proposition that self-sufficiency rewards those who understand the ways of the wild . But before long , the mind wants more than just a stare . If you ' re an Audubon , I suppose , you begin to focus on visual detail . If you ' re a Darwin , you think about phylum and class . If you ' re a Thoreau , you reflect on the way nature holds an unflattering mirror up to humanity . But what if you ' re just a journalist on holiday ? Raccoons rarely make headlines . And even a solid feature story on the Procyon lotor , small cousin of the black bear , would want to dwell on its relationship with people - overturned garbage cans , midnight raids on the compost heap , and that sort of thing . Not much newsworthy in a backwoods stare - at least , not as the world counts newsworthiness. // The canoe , still drifting slightly , swung in a dead-slow arc .

In a sense , of course , he was just what I wanted : He was my reward for fumbling out of bed before dawn and paddling through the gelid air . I , however , was distinctly not what he expected - an interruption of his otherwise leisurely forage along a hidden stretch of bog . What gave me the right , then , to satisfy my curiosity at the expense of his breakfast ? What could I learn from him in person ( if the term may be stretched to cover coons ) that I couldn ' t have learned more quickly , and certainly more warmly , by reading about him beside the fire back at the cabin ? // It ' s a matter , I thought ( still staring : neither of us had flinched ) , of privacy . In a way , that ' s what the call of the wild has always been : the search for seclusion , for sanctuary , for the place far from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and depth can be lived on the surface . We have friends up here who , when they go camping every summer , set as their only goal the finding of a place as far away from anyone else as they can . That , too , is an old tradition , probably predating Odysseus. // The canoe , by now , had stopped moving . And I began to glimpse , through the black mask of that patient face , what troubled me . This old tradition of seclusion , it seemed , was squarely at odds with journalism . For journalism wants in so many ways to barge in upon that privacy , hale it into public for all the world to see , roll it about on the tongue as the hard candy of the worldly wise . On one hand , the uninvaded wilderness ; on the other , the intrusive nose of reportage. // Had it not been for what happened next , I might have left the matter at that - bathing myself in the mixed light of a righteous indignation blended with a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' m sure I only imagined that he shrugged - and took up his bushy hunt again . Perhaps he had grown used to my stillness . Or perhaps he had concluded ( quite rightly ) that a man in a straw hat armed only with paddles at 30 paces was a threat worthy of supreme indifference . But just maybe , knowing he was being watched , he consciously set out to display raccoonishness ( or is it raccoonicity ? ) in its best possible light - assiduously tipping up logs , hunting under tufts , and fishing through the pickerel weed with a new-found determination. // So had I really intruded upon a privacy ? Or had I merely watched nature at work ? Was I uncovering secrets best left undiscovered ? Or was I simply bearing witness to the inherent and instructive characteristics of a neighbor ? Was this an invasion or an invitation - and , whichever it was , did it make the world a worse or a better place ? // One is not usually driven out of swamps by moral wrestlings . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , in that indifferent stretch of woods , I had stumbled upon the central dilemma of the reporter ' s craft . The good reporter - or essayist , or teacher , or artist of any sort - leaves , like that raccoon , no promising stone unturned . Every detail moves toward coherence . Each gesture and word , however haphazard , begins to compose a character - and , through that , a world . All is grist for the mill. // But with curiosity must come also discretion - the sensitivity that knows when insight has crumbled into mere gossip , how the noble observation of ideas can degenerate into a petty fascination with personalities , where to draw the line between genuine public discourse and legitimately private intimacies . To maintain the highest regard for the confidential , and the lowest tolerance for the cover-up ; to write not simply so that the reader can know but can understand ; to do it all without being manipulated by one ' s subjects or duped by one ' s own excitement - there are days , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it ' s easier to be a raccoon . What they find , after all , they simply eat - whether or not anyone is watching. // // // //
