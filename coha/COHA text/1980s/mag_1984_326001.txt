MX foes get four more chances to kill the bird <P> The impasse over the defense budget had almost threatened to destroy the already shaky process through which Congress determines how federal funds will be spent . But after wrangling for months in the partisan atmosphere of an election year , leaders of the Republican Senate , the Democratic House and the Reagan Administration finally reached agreement last week on military spending . The compromise included goodies for all participants . But on the stickiest issue , the future of the MX missile , House Democrats came out a clear winner . <P> The accord reached by Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker , House Speaker Tip O'Neill and White House aides does not kill the often wounded but seemingly indestructible intercontinental missile . Unless its critics are undermined by a Reagan re-election landslide , however , they will have at least four clean shots next year at grounding the MX for good . Predicted a confident O'Neill : " The MX will never be deployed . " Warned a less certain Democratic colleague , Representative Les AuCoin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we still have to drive the silver stake through its heart . " <P> In 1983 , Congress narrowly approved $2.1 billion to begin production and deployment of 21 of the controversial missiles . The Administration this year asked for money to add 40 more in 1985 . The Senate balked , agreeing to fund only 21 additional missiles . Last May the House knocked that number down to 15 . It also attached strings , insisting that no new money could be spent unless both houses gave a go-ahead next April . <P> That deadlock was broken last week in a two-part deal : first , it was agreed that $1 billion more could be spent on deployment of the 21 missiles authorized last year and now under construction ; second , the $1.5 billion needed for the 15 missiles in 1985 would not be released until both the House and the Senate passed authorization and appropriations bills again before next year 's Easter recess . All of which means that if the Administration loses any of those four votes on the MX , production of the missile would end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also in dispute was the level of defense spending for next year . Reagan had asked for $313 billion , which would have been a 13% increase after inflation . The President had said , however , that he could accept $299 billion , a 7.8% hike . <P> The Senate Armed Services Committee , headed by Texas Republican John Tower , approved that sum . The House Armed Services Committee voted only $292 billion . Under last week 's compromise , the two chambers will authorize spending of $297 billion , giving Tower a symbolic victory . But Congress will actually appropriate only $292.9 billion . <P> The Administration emerged on top of another disputed defense issue . The House had voted to block Air Force plans to test developing antisatellite weapons against targets in space . The Senate had no objection to such tests . In the compromise , the Air Force will be permitted to make two Star Wars experiments next year . Said a House staff member : " We lost that one cold . " <P> Both houses still must approve the entire compromise , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Whether the decisions reached this year will prevail in 1985 may hinge on the November elections and the makeup of the new Congress in January .
