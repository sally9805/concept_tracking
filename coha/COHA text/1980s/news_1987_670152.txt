NORTH ' S TESTIMONY damages Reagan and some key aides . It intensifies suspicions that the president either knew what was going on or was oblivious to critical events of his presidency . Poindexter ' s appearance will be pivotal to Reagan ' s credibility . If the former national-security adviser corroborates major parts of North ' s story , it will be very hard for the White House to argue that North was running a rogue operation . Reagan is further undermined by North ' s testimony that the president ' s close friend Casey was intimately involved . Intelligence officials say the then-CIA chief sometimes would see Reagan without the knowledge of his national-security advisers . North also raises the stakes for Shultz ' s appearance , and Meese faces especially intense questions because of the claim he knew of an early Iranian arms shipment . Flip-flop : After insisting earlier in the week that Reagan was too busy to watch the hearing , the White House now says he " has seen a good deal of it . " SUMMIT PLANNING lags as both sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any big substantive stumbling blocks , " says one U.S. arms-control official , who still predicts a fall summit . But neither side wants to appear to be in a rush . U.S. officials emphasize skepticism to defuse conservative suspicions that they are pursuing an agreement at any price . American strategists claim that with the Allies unenthusiastic about the deal , the pressure is on Gorbachev to bend . But the Soviets also play it coy . They backed away from a proposed Shultz-Shevardnadze meeting this week after first indicating they would go along . U.S. officials speculate they were irritated by a leak suggesting they would agree to further compromises . A TRADE COMPROMISE Reagan could swallow may still emerge , officials say . Administration strategists see the Senate bill as growing ever " trashier " this month as debate drags on and lawmakers attach more protectionist provisions . In some respects , the White House fears that the Senate version of the Gephardt amendment will be worse than the original . Mandatory import relief is regarded as sure veto bait . But trade staffers still think a deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can sign . The hope , says one , is that " cooler heads will prevail the longer this goes on . " Officials think improving trade figures may give members some political protection for a more moderate bill . " Senators are counting on the conference to save them from themselves , " says one official . " Unless the bill is improved in conference , " it will be vetoed , says GOP Sen. Packwood . " So the bill will essentially be written in conference . " OLLIEGATE : North said he accepted the $16 , 000 security system and gate for his home  --  paid for at least partly from proceeds of the Iran-Contra operation  --  because he couldn ' t get government protection after Abu Nidal ' s threat . But the Secret Service says it could have done the job if North had simply obtained Reagan ' s approval . Kissinger and Regan got such aid in the past . " If the president orders , we do it , " a spokesman says . ROSTENKOWSKI ' S SURGERY for appendicitis further delays tax-bill action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign any bill , even one that sticks only to modest excise-tax increases . Speaker Wright pushes a soak-the-rich bill to stake out political turf for 1988 . BROCK URGES Reagan aides to moderate opposition to a raft of labor-backed bills moving in Congress . The labor secretary fears that a confrontational strategy could lead to a series of Reagan defeats . Instead , he urges a bob-and-weave strategy , resisting some bills while seeking a deal on others . PART OF THE PROBLEM : Georgia Rep. Barnard recently sent out two news releases in the same envelope . One attacked the House budget resolution for not cutting enough spending . The other was headlined " Barnard ' s Favored Projects Pass in Energy/Water Appropriations Bill . " BEATING BORK is increasingly possible , Senate Democrats insist . They believe they have a good shot at the 41 votes needed to sustain a filibuster against Reagan ' s Supreme Court nominee . Strong black opposition may affect important Southern Democrats like Heflin and Nunn . The other key is GOP moderates like Chafee , Durenberger and Heinz ; the active opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the NAACP legal-defense fund , could help sway them . As the Judiciary Committee focuses on the Bork hearings , scheduled to start Sept. 15 , other Reagan judicial nominations could face delays . Republicans may also use the Bork hearings to tie up progress on the Democrats ' fair-housing bill . But Republicans believe the issue is perilous for the Democrats and , says White House pollster Wirthlin , is particularly " a mine field for Biden . " MINOR MEMOS : Celebrating North ' s testimony , a satiric group sponsors a game show  --  " Wheel of Soldier of Fortune . " The word puzzle says " Reagan knew . " . . . Celebrity plug ? North ' s written statement invites the committee chairmen to " sit down and have a Coors " with him . Brewer Joseph Coors donated $60 , 000 to the Contras . . . . The Force is with it : A House proposal entitled " Jobs for Employable Dependent Individuals " becomes known as the Jedi bill.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
