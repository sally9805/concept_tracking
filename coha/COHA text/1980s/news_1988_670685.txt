Now standing inside the 52-story vehicle assembly building at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida , the shuttle Discovery is to be moved Sunday to the launching pad , marking a critical milestone in the nation ' s re-covery from the Challenger disaster in January 1986 that killed seven astronauts and grounded the nation ' s shuttle fleet. // In late August or early September , the revamped Discovery is scheduled to make the first shuttle flight in nearly three years , blasting into space with a five-man crew. // In a series of interviews , officials and experts of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration discussed the long repair process , its promise and problems . Many seemed emotionally torn as they spoke , clearly eager to increase safety but visibly frustrated by the numerous changes and flight delays the process has entailed. // " The period of penance has been long enough , " said George T. Sasseen , director of shuttle engineering at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida . " We ' re in this business to get into space , not to modify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 400 by one count , 600 by another , have been made to enhance reliability , improve performance and increase safety . But paradoxically , experts say the changes also can aggravate two of the space agency ' s worst problems : delays in the launching schedule and risk for the astronauts during the craft ' s first flight. // " You introduce complexity when you try to fix things up , " said Charles Perrow , a Yale sociologist and author of " Normal Accidents , " a study of high-technology risk . " For every positive improvement in safety you also add a negative factor because of the complexity . And sometimes that will catch up with you. " // Although the most important changes were in the design of the flawed solid-fuel booster rocket , whose leak triggered the Challenger explosion , hundreds of other changes were made to the shuttle itself , its systems and support equipment on the ground. // Space agency experts emphasize that improved hardware should make Discovery ' s flight one of the safest ever . Yet they also acknowledge that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since new hazards can be accidently added as others are eliminated . Indeed , the first post-Challenger mission is viewed as a test flight , the crew consisting entirely of space veterans ready to handle " surprises " during the four-day voyage. // " There ' s some risk on that score , " said Richard A. Colonna , head of the orbiter projects office at the Johnson Space Center in Houston . " But I personally think it ' s minor. " // Indeed , the space agency has struggled to minimize risk by extensively testing new hardware on the ground , searching as best it can for weak points before the flight . Altered equipment has been shaken , vibrated , powered up , run , taken apart , inspected and run again - everything short of the ultimate test , flying it in space . Support equipment has also been put through its paces . Moreover , the assembled spaceship , which is to sit on the launching pad for two months before thundering aloft , will be put through a host of inspections and tests. // However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the potential to uncover new flaws , again delaying the oft-postponed mission . Such an episode occurred last December when a nozzle part in a booster rocket unexpectedly burned off during a test firing , triggering a change in the rocket design and further delaying the launching two months. // Despite lingering threats , excitement is building throughout the space agency as the launching draws near . Last week , cheers and applause broke out among several hundred workers at the Kennedy Space Center as the 85-ton Discovery was towed to the giant assembly building , where it will be mated with its two booster rockets and its external fuel tank before moving to the launching pad. // " This is like a rebirth , " John J. Talone Jr. , director of Discovery ' s ground processing , said as the spaceship emerged into the sunlight for the first time in 600 days . " We ' re in business again and we ' re going to stay in business . " <> <> Urgent , Prudent or Optional // The extensive changes to the nation ' s three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arose in several ways . First , some improvements were planned or under consideration before Challenger ' s fiery demise . Second , the Presidential commission that investigated the Challenger disaster issued a report in June 1986 that recommended a series of major alterations . Finally , NASA proposed many other changes after its own review uncovered new areas of concern . The accumulated changes were broken into three categories : urgent ones to be done before the next flight , prudent ones no later than 1989 or 1990 , and optional ones by 1991 or 1992. // So far , the cost of overhauling the shuttle and its support systems has come to about $2. 4 billion , according to James H. Brier , a financial analyst at NASA headquarters in Washington . When the changes are finished , he said , the total bill should be about $3. 5 billion . The figures include modifications at the Kennedy and Johnson space centers as well as the following repairs to the shuttle and its rockets : // * The 149-foot-long , solid-fuel booster rockets have been redesigned top to bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the joints and seals between booster segments that failed in the Challenger launching , the internal insulation , the fuel igniter , the nozzle , and the giant bracket holding the booster in place . As a backup , external heaters have been added to keep seals from the kind of cold-weather stiffening that helped touch off the Challenger disaster. // * The shuttle ' s three main liquid-fuel engines have undergone about 30 hardware changes , including the strengthening of turbopump blades to prevent cracking and strengthening of main fuel valve housings and main combustion chamber outlets to block structural failure. // * The 154-foot-long external fuel tank , which holds liquid oxygen and hydrogen for the main engines , has undergone eight changes , including the strengthening of a fuel line housing , the use of a more reliable battery and the redesign of an explosive bolt used to disconnect electrical cables on the launching pad. // * The 122-foot-long spaceship has undergone about 220 changes , including rewiring , brake and steering improvements , the stiffening of the landing gear , strengthening of structures in wings and engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s surface . A pair of 17-inch fuel valves connecting the spacecraft and the external fuel tank have been overhauled to insure they stay open while engines are firing . Additions to the ship include a new hatch that can be blown off in an emergency , an escape pole so the astronauts can bail out at high altitudes , and an escape slide to help them flee the craft while on the ground . <> <> Changes on the Ground // In addition to these changes , the shuttle ' s support equipment at the Johnson and Kennedy space centers has undergone sweeping modifications . For instance , the astronaut walkway on the 34-story gantry next to the launching pad has been outfitted with flame deflectors and water sprinklers to aid astronauts trying to escape a burning shuttle . In addition , two escape baskets have been added to the existing five on the gantry , allowing more astronauts and workers to speed down 1 , 200-foot cables to safety on the ground . At the terminus is a large new bunker with steel-reinforced concrete walls in which personnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuttle ' s launching have been altered , with about 38 , 000 changes to 500 , 000 lines of computer code , according to Mr. Sasseen at the Kennedy Space Center . All told , he said , there have been some 160 major modifications to shuttle support gear at Kennedy. // " We agonized over each and every one of them because they didn ' t come for free , " Mr. Sasseen said . For example , modifications of a huge gantry arm that pulls hydrogen fumes away from the external fuel tank cost between $4 million and $5 million , he said . During Challenger ' s launching , the arm failed to lock in place , threatening to bounce and hit the spacecraft as it moved skyward . The revamped arm is more secure , officials say . Too Much Caution ? Perhaps the biggest change of all is attitude . Today NASA officials constantly talk of safety , conservatism and prudence . Indeed , some experts say there may be too much caution over the hardware changes. // " I personally feel some were unnecessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But there were arguments on both sides , and the total management team felt they were worth doing . In general , all the modifications were good things to have done. " // Asked if NASA had lost its nerve , Mr. Colonna replied : " It ' s not that . It ' s a new attitude saying we should take the extra steps to be sure that we ' re safe , and when people do that they start being very conservative. " // But the changes , while increasing safety when considered individually , can add a new kind of riskiness . Indeed , for this reason the credo of aerospace engineers is " If it ' s not broken , don ' t fix it . " For instance , a new bolt might increase the reliability of a joint , but it also might unexpectedly block the movement of a nearby piece of critical equipment . <> <> Equivalent of 100 Missions // To minimize such risks , the space agency has embarked on an extraordinary program of testing . For instance , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have subjected an exact replica of the shuttle ' s new escape pole to the kind of pounding it will get during launch and landing . It has been shaken over and over , for an equivalent of 100 missions . " We completed the vibration tests without structural failure , satisfying requirements for safety and operational use , " said Bill Adams , an aerospace engineer in charge of the work. // So too , the shuttle ' s main engines have been repeatedly run to check changes and make sure modifications have introduced no new uncertainties . Altogether , 208 test firings have taken place since the Challenger accident , nine of those being tests of Discovery ' s engines , according to Robert D. Paster , a vice president of the Rocketdyne Division of Rockwell International in Canoga Park , Calif. // Moreover , two additional propulsion tests must be successfully completed before Discovery is cleared for launch . On July 22 , with the spaceship bolted firmly to the launch pad , its three main engines are to be fired for 20 seconds to test modifications and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , a fifth and final full-scale ignition is planned for the redesigned booster rocket at the Morton Thiokol plant in Utah , where the rockets are built. // Of course , all this testing and preparation is no guarantee that the shuttle , once aloft , will have a flawless flight . There still could be unexpected problems , despite years of work , hundreds of improvements , and billions of dollars meant to enhance safety. // " The worst thing you can do to an airplane is put it in a hanger for three years and make a lot of changes , " said John M. Lounge , one of the five astronauts training to fly Discovery . " When you bring that airplane back , the first thing you do is a test flight to wring out every system , to find the surprises . We ' ll see that . To a large extent this mission is a check flight. " //
