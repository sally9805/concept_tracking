Persuading Congress to adopt tax reform is not unlike treating addiction . ( Congressmen have become so dependent on trading tax breaks for political favors from special interest groups that the only way they can stop now is to go cold turkey . For a Congressman to say he can make an exception for one lobbyist but not another is like an alcoholic swearing he can take just one drink . <P> When President Reagan announces his tax-reform package in a nationwide speech scheduled for next week , he will call on Congress to shun the influence peddlers and approve a program that is both simple and fair . Unfortunately , the Administration has tossed enough favors for interest groups into its own package to stir grumblings that the preacher himself has been tippling on the way to the temperance meeting . <P> The tax plan the President approved last week in nearly final form is the diluted successor to a widely heralded proposal first unveiled by the Treasury last November . The original plan , now referred to as Treasury I , was a breathtakingly populist document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly sacred cows , like deductions for mortgage interest on family homes , were left unscathed . The package that the President will send to Congress , on the other hand , is a good deal less pristine . <P> To be sure , Treasury II , also known as President I , is still a sweeping attempt to close a slew of loopholes . Even the infamous three-martini lunch is threatened ; businessmen would be able to deduct only $15 per person for lunch , and entertainment expenses like box seats at sporting events would no longer be deductible at all . By eliminating enough deductions , the Treasury can afford to reduce overall tax rates . The top federal income tax bracket would drop from 50% to 35% , with brackets of 25% and 15% for those making less . <P> At the same time , Treasury Secretary James Baker has made significant concessions to a procession of lobbyists who have trooped through his department over the past four months . The oil and gas industry , for years the sheltered favorite of congressional committees , successfully persuaded Baker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by Treasury I. The oil-depletion allowance and fast write-offs for drilling have been at least partly preserved . Without incentives , the oil lobby argued , new energy sources would go untapped , making the U.S. more dependent on foreign oil . The oilmen even wangled a meeting with the President , who was reported to be fully conversant with oil tax shelters , having considered them for his own investments before he took office . " This is no light courtin ' here , " declares Oil Lobbyist Harold ( " Bud " ) Scoggins . " We mean business . " <P> A centerpiece of the massive $750 billion Reagan tax cut of 1981 was a provision that allowed businesses to deduct the cost of buying new equipment even faster than the equipment wore out . This " accelerated cost-recovery system " would cost $35 billion next year . Treasury I eliminated ACRS , but lobbyists persuaded the Reaganauts that the economic recovery was in large part produced by such enlightened tax cuts . As a result , Treasury II largely restores ACRS.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
