txt // Painters , more immediate in their response , less worried by ideas perhaps , if you like less educated , do more , often present their enjoyment for what it is ? or they did do so . I think of Constable looking all this time for the " calm sunshine of the soul " , declaring that he 'd never seen an ugly thing in his life ; of Turner lost in his wheel of radiance ; of Monet , Renoir , Pissarro , Sisley , or Cezanne involved in the world 's facets of blue and green and ochre ; of Bonnard and Matisse and Dufy and of Ben Nicholson . In the Tate there is a picture quivering with enjoyment in exactly the way I mean , in the simplest terms and by the subtlest devices ? go and look at it ? Sisley 's Path to the Old Ferry . But if paintings grant us our escape into enjoyment ( I say escape , not as having to do with escapism but as one would talk of an escape to freedom over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the habit of pushing the painter 's admonition , such as it is , rather to one side . But are n't we still left , in the main , trudging , almost happily trotting , along our road to unhappiness , our road to secular hell , by preference , in this present phase of being miserable ? And I am saying in brief to hell with more hell in our minds than is justified . I am saying we should do better , writer and reader , artist and those who look and those who hear , with rather more recognition , rather more celebration , of secular heaven on this earth when it does briefly , intermittently and on that account poignantly occur . If our engagement is to life , if it is against the beastly ( which we have to recognize and reckon with , all the same ) it is ipso facto for the enjoyable . 1969 In the Stables of Pegasus I had the following experiences after reading till late these essays and aphoristical remarks by the poet George Barker . ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon , noticed shining leaves on top of a tree , and heard a breadth and loudness of wind , and said , My God , how wonderful ; and reflected at once on how we use those words My God as an inherited ejaculation . After in a dream I encountered Novalis walking with two children along the pedestrian close , from the supermarket . He looked like a modest accountant from the Borough offices ; I was surprised to see him , because he had been dead . for so long . Considering this dream I thought , Well , he could n't have been George Barker . In his time rational and mystical , Novalis , who had looked to me as " normal " as someone from the Borough offices , had naturally to begin , continue , and conclude with " God " ; around whom , in our time ? but is George Barker in our time , or in any time ? ? one is wise to put those two inverted commas . It is true these muddled pieces achieve in tone a simulacrum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in their author , an Arnoldian Scholar Gypsy , pensive , and tongue-tied ? decidedly tongue-tied , in hat of antique shape and cloak of grey . The Spark has fallen on him ? well , he believes it has ; he has caught it , it escapes ( giggling a little ) , he catches it again . But he ca n't get it into his vasculum with the frail-leafd white anemones , etcetera . At any rate he is too tongue-tied ? my God , how his sloppy often ungrammatical sentences intricate themselves ! ? to illuminate his illumination . God , Love , the Dionysiac , Imagination , the Real , Poetry ? the ineffable is always difficult to catch , even if you have ( which Mr Barker has n't ) the philosophic or the educated abilities of a Coleridge or a Novalis . ( The effable is rather more in the tin , I might add : the Spark is given a habitat in the mystic rose on two legs now and again . ) George Barker fears , on one page , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not pretentious , I would say ; fuddled , in his transcendental hunt , in his avoidance of the possibly awful joke of being . I would n't say that even the dedication , " To the memory of Thomas Steams Eliot " , is pretentious ; it is only unfortunate and deluded. // He gives pleasure now and then . " The unicorn does not exist because it has better things to do . " " The most poetical magazine title : Harper 's Bazaar . " " It has always seemed remarkable to me that no winged horse has ever stalked into a library knocking over the leather chairs , whinnying fit to crack the electric light bulbs and depositing its golden excrement inside the swing doors as it paced out . " But if I ask myself what I know better after this " groping in the dark backward and the abysm of the mind " , I think I must say , only George Barker , his swoons , his preferences , his confusions , the bright stutter too , and disconnections , of his verse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well in the land of Mrs Eddy ? if that land still exists ? Gentleman of Letters : Allen Tate It has to be confessed ? and should be confessed more often ? that good literary criticism is less common than good writing of other kinds . It asks for more than responsive estimation , or recognition of characterizing elements , or a theory of cultural value , or proper behaviour . Like all other writing , the criticism which persuades or provokes the reader , which delights him and instructs him or makes him argue with the critic or with himself , has inescapably to convey and project an individuality : it requires a man himself in words which do n't , when a momentary reputation or position is maintained no longer , reveal themselves as moulded by the style of a period . Mr Allen Tate proffers , in such terms , the always difficult problem of the critic ? the poet as well ? whom we have to like , inasmuch as he always has been on the right side . When there has been a mob , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth ; when there has been a lynching among poets or other writers , Mr Tate has n't been there to give a flick of contempt to the horny toes . He is a Southern Gentleman of Letters . Yet should we be on any side but our own ? And what are we to say of the writer of a party ( a party not being a mob ) , when we find it difficult not to be inattentive to his writing ? When we find his writing too plain , too removed , with no main root in a layer of sensation ? We read through Mr Allen Tate 's essays ? forty years ' length of criticism ' ? and we are seldom , or never , outraged . His sentences are never tumultuous ; and they are seldom stretched to an effective tightness . Are we missing much , when our attention falters ? It falters so often because , as we read , we have frequently to translate into straight terms ; we have to say " translate " when Mr Tate says " render " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps such phraseology is its own total , its own condemnation ? when Mr Tate , once more , says " twofold " , " framework " , " cash nexus " , " the modern world " , " not quite pertinent " , " here in its full import " , " for a brief span " , " fundamental failure " , " totality of experience " , " mode of perception " , or " not susceptible of logical demonstration " . There is no use blinking these facts , as Mr Tate would ? and does ? write . They constitute Mr Tate 's carefully un- // careful criticism ; they are the material built into essays under such matching , caricatural titles as " The Function of the Critical Quarterly " , or " A Reading of Keats " , or " A Note on Critical Autotelism " , or " Three Types of Poetry " , or " Crane : The Poet as Hero " . Among them all we begin to ask , Where then is Mr Tate ? Does , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels . It is pleasant enough to encounter a critic and poet who finds himself bored and irritated by talk of " the political responsibility of poets " . It is pleasant to find Mr Tate affirming that " the poet has a great responsibility of his own . . . to write poems " . He does n't like talking poets , of whom we have many . It is pleasant to find someone declaring of the critical quarterly ( Mr Tate is n't , by total uniform , a man of the campus ) that it " now increasingly serves the end of acquainting unpopular writers with one another 's writing " . But observations of that kind hardly elevate us to the high plateau or to the high tops of criticism . The best American poets have tried to discover new and precise languages by which poetry now as always must give us knowledge of the human condition ? knowledge that seems to reach us partly in the delight that one gets from rhythm and insights that one has not already heard and known . But of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lipped rather frequently by the reader who does persist ; the reader who is glad to notice Mr Tate 's feeling of indebted admiration for Coleridge ? and who is sorry that in a critic of such decency he finds so few , or none , of those Coleridgean sentences at which we pause , a little stunned and then delighted bc : ause a truth up to now unrecognized and unencountered has been enunciated , all of a sudden . Mr Tate on poets and poetry brings us into gingerly contact with the ninety poems ' ( out of 250 , a small published total for a long career ) by which he would be remembered . He has written of his method of isolating " the general ideas implicit in the poet 's work " ; and as if he recognized that it is a method too unbodily , he has strengthened it with an essay about " tension " in a poem , meaning " the full organized body of all the extension and intension we can find in it " . Extension is the act of extending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is extended , a unitary effect . Touch- // stones of this poetry of the centre , this poetry of tension , include , he tells us , " Cover her face : mine eyes dazzle ; she died young " , or Eliot 's We have lingered in the chambers of the sea By sea girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown Till human voices wake us and we drown . This idea of tension shifts at any rate towards the poem as an object born of objectifying . Mr Tate continues ( in that tiredly respectable language in which he can also inform us that his friend the late Herbert Read was " one of the finest poets of our time " ) that poets of America have used " a certain mode of perception " which he has named " the aesthetic-historical " . Is this intended as praise or blame ? Using some remarks of the late Michael Roberts , he expounds it by saying that American poets are " less firmly rooted in a settled poetic tradition than the British " , so they are able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ languages and periods " . Whether Mr Tate is being neutral ( as Michael Roberts was ) or depreciatory , it is that ability to digest which one often doubts . Coming , for instance , to Mr Tate 's selection of his poems , we find him speaking , from the blue grass of the ( not unremote ) Kentucky of his origins , about Greece , about France , about England ; about gods , heroes , philosophers , poets . Here in his poems we encounter , by name , Venus , Narcissus , Pasiphae , Europa , Tantalus , Pelops , Priam , Aeneas , Pericles , Zeno , Parmenides , Plato , Socrates , Callimachus , Horace , Propertius , Webster ( skulls beneath the skin ) , Kyd , Ford , Donne , Marvell , Pope , Collins , Landor , Blake , Rimbaud , Yeats ; this American poet at times attitudinizing , as if to say , " These are mine , as well " , at times ( slightly ) despairing , like his friend and fellow-Fugitive and fellowSouthern-Gentleman Poet , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his delightful and strong Philomela . The call to the classical Elsewhere is most tactful and acceptable in " The Swimmers " , the name of which Mr Tate gives to this selection ( not surprisingly , because it is about his strongest poem ) . Scene of " The Swimmers " : Montgomery County , Kentucky , July 1911 . Circumstances : five children , himself included , coming to bathe in clear summer springs . Impingement : a posse , a hanged Negro , his body , dragged off in a hearse which is only dust , a body which at the court-house is shrouded only in the sun . The call to Greece , in this sunlit horror , is no more than the quick velvety touch of mullein as // these boys run towards Kentucky water ? " mullein under the ear / Soft as Nausicad 's palm " . No more , except , down the page , the word " odyssey " with a small o . A poem Allen Tate must think about with satisfaction . Elsewhere , in Mr Tate 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but certainly interrupts ; and as in the prose , we encounter in many of these neat , by no means untensed poems , respectable long-expired elements , alike in phrase and in movement . Poems will begin ? each time we have been there before ? " Didactic Laurel , loose your reasoning leaf ' , " Irritable spring , infuse " , " Lady of Light , I would admit " , or " Captain of Industry , your aimless power " ? tributes to Mr Tate 's education , not to his gift from the Muses . Is n't it Nashville , Tennessee ( where Mr Tate attended Vanderbilt University ) , which flaunts a replica on a reduced scale of the Parthenon , in concrete ( yes , somewhat , but only somewhat , recalling the not quite naturalized Palladian villas of England , the not quite naturalized grots and nymphs of the era of our own Parnells or Akensides ) ? The " taste " is perfect ( except when Allen Tate tries the jocular or the generally inconsequent ) , the material is n't concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intension worked for ? and the tension deceptive . Few poems entice us to a second reading , possibly only " The Swimmers " : that does demand reading again , and then again , with the peremptoriness which is inflicted on us by the real thing . Poems that may have given us a turn , a sense of novelty , years ago ? such as " Mr Pope " ? reveal their brittle derivation on re-acquaintance . There is too much evidence of the contrived , the hoped for , Leyond the gift of the poet ? a poet , Mr Tate admits in his essay of 1968 on " Poetry Modern and Unmodern " , who has never been quite able to do what he wanted to do , one reason for this perhaps being the difficulty of discovering what he wanted to do ; which may be translated into the difficulty of discovering a Muse when all you have is the membership of a select club . He tells us courageously , yet revealingly , that he discovered modernism ? " or perhaps I had better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which modernism developed " ? not through Yeats , Eliot or Pound , but in James Thomson ( B.V. ) , adding that it remained only ? yes , only ? " to find the right language and to establish a centre from which it could be spoken " . His selection is rounded off with ? should we say ? ? the only literate English // version of the Pervigilium Veneris ( though this reviewer does not care for Mr Tate 's ingenious refrain , " Tomorrow may loveless , may lover tomorrow make love " , either for euphony or accuracy ; and he does not see how Mr Tate so conventionally knows that " few people today read the Pervigilium Veneris " ; any fewer , that is , than might be expected for poems which have n't been written by Shakespeare or Mr Robert Lowell ) . 1971 Craft Cheese ; or How Poems are Treated Professor Cleanth Brooks mentions disclaimingly , detergently almost , that he is labelled a New Critic ; then he proclaims that whatever else the critic may criticize , " there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts its heaviest stresses on the writing itself , " and unsurprisingly he goes on , " The most important thing about Shakespeare , for example , is the fact that he was a great dramatist . " ' There you are . And if you reach this page xiv of the prelims you may suspect that ahead of you there stretch 380 pages at least spotted with the banal . So it will prove , though not disagreeably . Cleanth Brooks does show himself again to be different from what may be called ( I hope without offence transatlantically ) our own native , resident or semi-resident Americans : he does n't go on in a hard superior way about next to nothing . He is polite , modest , and wide . He actually quotes when he is discussing poems . He does n't erect a small canon of the respectable , he does n't parade his bad bogey authors , the ones , if you are crass enough to enjoy anything about them , who mark you as some crutch pheasant of Sunday or weekly journalism , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He likes the prose which Yeats wrote about literature and being a poet , and wishes to show that Yeats had a very clear notion of what poetry was and specifically that he conceived of it as providing a special kind of truth and therefore distinguished it , on the one hand , from mere self-expression and , on the other hand , from propaganda for a cause ( which is n't much more than wishing to show that Yeats was a major poet , which was already obvious ? ) . Auden pleases him as a virtuoso of poems and the critical asking of questions . He praises the short stories ? or one of them ? by that underpraised American Peter Taylor . He rather nicely insists on the classical decorum of John Crowe Ransom 's delicious poems by showing how Ransom pushes himself away from the poems , keeping at an aesthetic distance , like Milton , he says , vis-a-vis // " Lycidas " and his other short pieces . He comes to Frost and Housman , and sensibly remarks the existence , after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with delight in a nature which is in fact , and is now recognized , sometimes regretfully , as a mindless , alien , indifferent bundle of phenomena . He is shrewd on sentimentality ( talking of Housman ? he likes Housman ) as " a failure of tone " ; although just that failure is invisible to him in Frost 's " Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening " . At times , like most critics of poetry , he betrays a casual ignorance of what a poem , at some point or another , is actually dealing with . A little piece of " close reading " which is n't close , of Housman 's XL in Last Poems , comes to traveller 's joy beguiling , in autumn , hearts which have lost their own joy : he says that in the autumn sunshine " the flower called traveller 's joy " silently extends " to the joyless wayfarer its grace of self , the namesake of joy " . If he had discovered that traveller 's joy is n't a " flower " , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if admirable in the autumn with bearded achenes ? " Old Man 's Beard " ? he might n't have been content with " Each of the vignettes suggests the secret life of nature revealed to a rapt and solitary observer " , he might have come deeper into the significance of the poem . Which is only one more , if a different , example of the frequent superficiality of A Shaping Joy . I do n't think this broad if slightly simple-minded book , named after a phrase in an essay by Yeats , was really entitled to be subnamed " Studies in the Writer 's Craft " . At any rate a thing it does n't show is much acquisition of such a craft ? if that sentimental word has to be used ? in its own writing . It is a bet that any banal phrase will turn up ? crossing watersheds , the usual task of poetry , appropriate pigeonholes , Blake 's dark satanic mills had arisen in England 's green and pleasant land , embarrassment of riches , and my task is made somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Professor Brooks says most of his essays were lectures , but I do n't think that explains ? or if it explains , would justify ? the simplemindedness ; and certainly it does n't excuse the style . Still , if it is a vulgar style , it is loose and unconceited : you can understand what this academic literary man is up to ( Professor Brooks , says the jacket ? mischievously ? ? " keeps the methods of communication marveliously sic unblocked " ) , even if it is never exhilarating and seldom ? except in paraphrase or precis of what his subjects write ? very interesting . Black Night for Poesy ? I believe these " observations on poetry and its enemies " amount on the whole to interesting nonsense , in a way which is also interesting . ' The way is quotation . Between a third and a quarter of the book is quotation direct , to make no mention of quotation indirect , in paraphrase . A guerrilla leader for poetry ( poesy , I incline to say ) , John Press deploys his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show how this art is now pushed to a " frontier of darkness " , beyond which it may become extinct . Plato ? oh dear ? is the name which has to come first : let poets be banished from the state . They are sensual liars , they are properly attacked by moralists , social perfectionists , political bosses , tidy administrators , and ? serve them right as unreasoning indulgent useless perverters of truth ? by the rationalists of science . The quotations are enjoyable ? Yeats , for instance , on Donne : " Donne could be as metaphysical as he pleased , and yet never seem inhuman and hysterical as Shelley often does , because he could be as physical as he pleased . " Or Lady Violet Bonham-Carter recalling how ( long before he used it in his war utterance ) she had introduced Churchill to Clough 's " Say not the struggle nought availeth " , and how Churchill had remarked what a marvellous poem it would be to quote in a by-election ( to which John Press might have added Churchill on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Being so numerous , all the same , the quotations do n't leave their generalissimo much room for his own words ( which very often are not really his own , but such as the poet 's task or striving for mastery , or , with no sign of quotation marks , as if he had thought the words up for himself , the still sad music of humanity ) . As a criticism I hesitate , after all , between interesting nonsense and interesting obviousness as a right description of this book . What is said has so often been said more keenly . With his sympathies rightly directed , John Press will just bring it up to date . He directs a right throw , for instance ( but is n't the old clay pipe unside down in that ample mouth too easy to hit ? ) , at C. P. Snow on Two Cultures , he recognizes that the common mind and the official mind everywhere have the same // desire to suppress or control . I do n't complain ? very much ? that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card-index ( which by the way does not happen to include anything about Goethe , when he reaches poetry and science , or anything about Taine 's horrible foretelling of the contemptuous role democracy would assign to its writers ) . The real nonsense seems to me John Press 's conviction that poetry or poets are now in unprecedented danger ? or danger of extinction . Is n't this our kind of millenary conceit ? I do not myself believe that everything now is worse , like sliced loaves ( what would John Press make of the not uncomforting fact that the French nowadays install bread-slicing machines behind the boulangerie counter so that each customer can have his loaf sliced only if he should prefer it that way ? ) I do n't myself believe that global vicissitudes or powerful common men with chambers in Albany or Ministers for Cultural Turnstiles , or commissars , or editors , or journalists of any kind , or advertising copywriters or advertising image-makers , or dry academics , are capable of extinguishing any art . We continue to be born , enjoy , suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. , is inevitable and will be extinguished only if makers and all are extinguished ; which is another matter . Of course it is as well to know how to recognize the enemies of a good thing , but what John Press forgets is what Whistler screamed in perfect verity ? that there never has been an artistic period , or country , or people , and never will be . Breeches of Bright Velvet : Two verdicts on Chatterton We write about a poet and think that for ourselves at least we have him fixed . What if we try again , years later ? With change of focus , change of exposure ? Of these two pieces about Chatterton , not quite a Dylan Thomas of an earlier age , the first was written and broadcast in 1946 . A quarter of a century later I tried again , when I had long forgotten that my first attempt existed . Others than myself may find it interesting and curious to compare the two . I. CHATTERTON FIRST EXAMINED The trouble with Chatterton is that there are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists in the poems . The other is the sensational Chatterton , the seventeen-year-old boy ? who was a genius , as we say ; who was misused by that in some ways nasty character Horace Walpole ; who starved ; who committed suicide in a London garret . It is , I agree , a wonderful , pathetic story . But the important Chatterton is the other one , the poet ; and if Chatterton had been run over by a coach , or slipped on the stairs , or fallen into the river on a dark night , he would still be as important , he would still be worth reading , as a remarkable English poet . All the same , I want to remind you of the scene of Chatterton 's death , as it was imagined , very exquisitely , by the Pre-Raphaelite painter Henry Wallis . The picture is in the Tate Gallery . Chatterton lies dead under a small attic window , through which you can see St Paul 's . He wears breeches of a vivid satin blue . Red hair curls round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the way , was another poet , George Meredith , with whose wife the painter disappeared . Near his feet a plum-coloured coat hangs over a chair . It is a very rich painting , a painting of richly combined colour ; imagined , but true , in spite of somewhat sententious details which have to be " read " , because to my mind it symbolizes the richness and the colour of Chatterton 's poetry . On Tiber 's banks , where scarlet jasmines bloom , And purple aloes shed a rich perfume ; Where , when the sun is melting in his heat , The reeking tigers find a cool retreat , // Bask in the sedges , lose the sultry beam , And wanton with their shadows in the stream ? Chatterton is alert , like Keats , in more than one sense at the same time , vision and the senses of smell and touch . That is what I mean by Chatterton 's colour and richness ? scarlet jasmines mixed with scent and purple aloes , and tigers reeking in strong sunshine ( in nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . You will have seen a macaw at the zoo . Macaws can be scarlet and purple and green ; they come from tropical South America ; and macaws are a favourite bird in the tropics of Chatterton 's poetry ? as though he had seen macaws , as he well may have done , brought back on the quays of the Port of Bristol . Here is one of Chatterton 's macaw poems , which he called , not exactly knowing where macaws came from , " An African Song " : Haste , ye purple gleams of light , Haste and gild the spacious skies ; Haste , ye eagles , take your flight , Haste and bid the morning rise . Now the Eastern curtain draws ; Now the red'ning splendour gleams , Now the purple plum 'd maccaws Skim along the silver streams . Now the fragrant-scented thorn , Trembles with the gummy dew ; Now the pleasures of the morn , Swell upon the eager view . Whither does my archer stray ? Whither is my Narva fled ? What can keep his soul away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Chatterton were written by him in London , in the last seven or eight months of his life ; and I think they show his real bent , his real nature and peculiarity as a poet rather more than his famous Rowley Poems , his imitations ? or imagined re-creations ? of Chaucerian English . The African poems are much less known , less read , and less admired , so I am going to take a longish piece from one of them , from " Heccar and Gaira " ; Heccar and Gaira are // two warriors , and Heccar reminds Gaira of his wife Cawna and of the depredations of the pallid children of the wave , the slave traders ? remember that Chatterton was a Bristolian and Bristol a slave traders ' port : Rouse not remembrance from her shadowy cell , Gaira replies , Nor of those bloody sons of mischief tell . Cawna , 0 Cawna ! decked in sable charms , What distant region holds thee from my arms ? Cawna , the pride of Africa 's sultry vales , Soft as the cooling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Trailing his glories through the blossomed brake ; Black as the glossy rocks , where Eascal roars , Foaming through sandy wastes to Jaghir 's shores ; Swift as the arrow , hasting to the breast , Was Cawna , the companion of my rest . The sun sat low'ring in the western sky , The swelling tempest spread around the eye ; Upon my Cawna 's bosom I reclined , Catching the breathing whispers of the wind . Swift from the wood a prowling tiger came , Dreadful his voice , his eyes a glowing flame ; I bent the bow , the never-erring dart Pierced his rough armour , but escaped his heart ; He fled , though wounded , to a distant waste , I urged the furious flight with fatal haste ; He fell , he died ? spent in the fiery toil , I stripped his carcass of the furry spoil , And , as the varied spangles met my eye , " On this " , I cried , " shall my loved Cawna lie . " The dusky midnight hung the skies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ; In the*deep valley and the mossy plain , I sought my Cawna , but I sought in vain . The pallid shadows of the azure waves Had made my Cawna , and my children , slaves . Reflection maddens to recall the hour ; The gods had giv'n me to the demon 's power . The dusk slow vanished from the hated lawn , // I gained a mountain glaring with the dawn . There the full sails , expanded to the wind , Struck horror and distraction in my mind ; There Cawna , mingled with a worthless train , In common slavery drags the hated chain . Now judge , my Heccar , have I cause for rage ? Should aught the thunder of my arm assuage ? In ever-reeking blood this javelin dyed With vengeance shall be never satisfied ; I 'll strew the beaches with the mighty dead And tinge the lily of their features red . That last line ? " And tinge the lily of their features red " ? or that earlier line " I gained a mountain glaring with the dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extravagance which Chatterton could produce again and again . Sometimes one or two lines like that come just when you think the poem is dull , silly , and underdone . Like snows that trickle down hot AEtna 's steep . Chatterton 's poetry was not only drawn out of mediaevalism and the tropics ? out of two distant countries , one in time and one in space which he had only imagined and never seen . The brilliant eyes which all Chatterton 's friends remembered ? his brilliant grey eyes , took in , gloomily and grandly , details of the autumn landscape at Bristol : The yellow Avon , creeping at my side , In sullen billows rolls a muddy tide ; No sportive naiads on her streams are seen , No cheerful pastimes deck the gloomy scene . Yellow was a favourite colour , a favourite adjective in Chatterton 's mind . He writes in one of his Bristol poems , the " Elegy to the Memory of Mr Thomas Phillips " : Here , stretched upon this heaven-ascending hill I 'll wait the horrors of the coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the glare of lambent vapours write . Then comes the yellow line : Wet with the dew , the yellow Hawthornes bow ; The loud winds whistle through the echoing dell ; Far o'er the lea the breathing cattle low And the shrill shrieking of the screech-owl swell . // With whistling sound the dusky foliage flies , And wantons with the wind in rapid whirls ; The gurgling rivulet to the valley hies , And , lost to sight , in dying murmurs curls . . . Chatterton played about with that poem , wrote and rewrote it . One can see how his mind was made up , and how his mind worked , from the changes . The gurgling rivulet curling out of sight in dying murmurs suggested to him a snake , so he rewrote that last stanza like this : With rustling sound the yellow foliage flies ? yellow instead of dusky ? And wantons with the wind in rapid whirls . The gurgling riv'let to the valley hies Whilst on the bank the spangled serpent curls . In other words , there is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some stream side in Leigh Woods ; and there you see the furniture of Chatterton 's mind . You would find in it , if you could open the lid , a pretty strange mixture ? brown owls and scarlet macaws , Gothic ruins and African jungles , knights in armour and black naked warriors with high-sounding names , striped tigers and hot sunshine , yellow leaves and autumn fogs , snakes and spices and volcanoes with Bristol 's muddy river rolling along to Avonmouth , all mixed with mad nomenclature imitated from the then best-selling epics of that other forger ? if the word is valid ? James Macpherson . To that medley , though , you have to add the pride , vigour and intelligence of Chatterton ? the power to write strong lines of suggestive exoticism as about scarlet jasmines and purple aloes , or such lines as those which conclude his poem " The Resignation " : The gloomy mantle of the night Which on my sinking spirit steals Will vanish at the morning light Which God , my East , my Sun reveals ? which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the marvellous boy " ? " the sleepless soul that perished in his pride " . // Thinking it all over , I should call pride ? energetic pride ? a chief mark of Chatterton 's poetry . And pride is a mark of really high poetry , as Chatterton 's might have become ? of poetry in a phrase of William Blake 's , who was one of Chatterton 's admirers , which " exists and exults in immortal thoughts " . Think of some of the poets of pride ? Shakespeare , Marlowe , Sir Walter Ralegh , Dryden , Pope , Landor , John Clare ? it is their company Chatterton belongs to . Of course , Chatterton 's poetry , Chatterton 's pride , is incomplete ? since he was eighteen when he killed himself . He only began : I thought of Chatterton , the marvellous boy , The sleepless soul that perished in his pride ; Of him who walked in glory and in joy Following his plough along the mountain side : By our own spirits are we deified : We Poets in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end despondency and madness . The end which comes to poets of pride , came much too quickly to Chatterton ; we only have the beginning in gladness . But I do not think any other English poet ? so far as we know ? began with powers more remarkable : and that is why Chatterton , with his macaws and tigers and ruins and snakes , is there to be read ; and not just remembered as a romantic boy who killed himself . 1946 2 . CHATTERTON RE-EXAMINED It was two hundred years ago last year ? so this bicentenary edition comes a bit late ' ? since Chatterton killed himself by taking arsenic in a Holborn garret ; after which we gave ourselves a new blessed martyr : poetry slain by orphanage , poverty , and that most civilized of men .

I think I may have to remind you , since the legend is less in circulation now ? eighteen years old ; and Walpole 's // fault was not to have returned some ( prose ) pieces on " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to pass off as " wroten bie " a Bristolian priest of the late fifteenth century , " T. Rowleie " . Letters and enclosures come to us out of the blue ; we ? for any one or several of a hundred reasons ? do not always return the enclosures as promptly as we should , requests or no . But then legends require a villain , and Walpole was the kind of man , the apparent dilettante and no more , the aristocratic dabbler , whom strangers dislike ( properly , as a rule ) . Everything , as in a saint 's legend , was seen , ex post facto , from a knowledge of the martyr 's situation ; of which wicked Walpole was inescapably ignorant , after all , and for which he was in no way to blame . Once arsenic and very real despair had disposed of Chatterton , the English public had before it ( as well as the Walpole story ) all of Chatterton 's Rowley poems , published posthumously in a time avid of the medieval , uncritical about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as always , warming to the fascinations of controversy . Were the poems read ? One imagines they were , if in the distorting light of the era and of the new legend ? " I thought of Chatterton , the marvellous boy " , as Wordsworth said for everyone in that wonder poem " Resolution and Independence " . Are they read now ? Not much , surely . Should they be read now ? That is to be asked of this bicentenary edition of everything decipherable that Chatterton ever wrote , Rowleian poems , Ossianic prose poems , African eclogues , squibs , album verses , satires , letters , antiquarian cook-ups . His American editor takes him very seriously . He works over Chatterton 's pseudomedieval language , he glossarizes it with new care , he quotes Saintsbury on Chatterton 's prosody , he attaches a commentary to each piece and poem , he includes Vivin-like drawings by Chatterton , yet never seems clear about his own activity . Is it poems he is dealing with ? Is it problems of the verbal and antique inventiveness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say " Note the alexandrine " , or " The virtuosic prosody of the play deserves comment in some detail " ; or " The interlude proceeds in ten-line iambic pentameter stanzas rhymed ababbcbcdd , except that the final couplet is dropped after 1.126 and an extra final couplet is added after 1.246 " ? which last example would n't help much were he commenting on a masterpiece , and not on one of the longer , more tiring // bursts of Rowleyism . In regard to poetic quality , of course there is no merit at all in Chatterton 's overlay of invented English . It adds nothing , it often makes the ridiculous more ridiculous : " Whatte dynne ys thys ? whattc menes this leathalle knele " ( which reminds me of the sign above a curiosity shop in Bradford , ANNE TEAKES ) ; it ofen serves to conceal the goodness of the few good things . This baby medievalism makes it hard , for instance , to enjoy the " Mynstrelles Songe " in ( Ella ; which may be pastiche ( so is the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered the best poem he ever made . One sees ( but I do n't think the editor does ) how Chatterton went to work : he wrote the song down in straight English ; 0 ! sing unto my roundelay , 0 ! drop the briny tear with me , Dance no more at holiday , Like a running river be ; My love is dead , Gone to his death-bed All under the willow tree . Then he tarted it with his doubled consonants , his altered and additional vowels , and so on , till he could lean back and approve , perhaps cynically : 0 ! synge untoe mie roundelaie , 0 ! droppe the brynie tear wythe mee , Daunce ne moe atte hallie daie , Lycke a reynynge ryver bee ; Mie love ys dedde , Gon to hys death-bedde , Al under the wyllowe tree . Of course the only thing to do is call Chatterton 's bluff and change this Mynstrelle 's Songe resolutely back to his Minstrel 's Song . Anxiously his new commentator quotes another commentator on a comment by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values adjust themselves " ? " But does this help us if we do not know what the vowel values are ? " 0 innocence . Chatterton was certainly precocious in energetic deter mination , he was like young Tennyson shouting and writing lines of epics which were fortunately lost on the winds of Lincolnshire or in the wastepaper baskets of his father 's parsonage ; he goes on and on ; he senses form and movement , // he can imitate or derive or adapt ? derive from Spenser or what was to be found , genuine or spurious , in Percy 's Reliques ; he can , he does interminably , imitate plain eighteenth-centuryism in his satirical couplets . About as near as his editor comes in the direction of criticism is to remark that his models were his markets . Reading him all through again , I reaffirm to myself that there is n't much in all his work , whether in movement or image , of which one can say , This is Chatterton , indisputably . I detect unique Chatterton in an image or two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Severn Bore ) , in an occasional brightness of yellow , or yellow cowslips of April , yellow leaves of autumn ? " Wet with the dew the yellow Hawthorns bow " ? as if he felt the cowslip scenery of the Downs , above Bristol Gorge , which still exists in a tamed way : Whanne Autumpne blake and sonne-brente doe appere , With his goulde honde guylteynge the falleynge lefe , Bryngeyne oppe Wynterr to fulfylle the yere , Beerynge uponne hys Backe the riped shefe ; Whan al the hyls wythe woddie sede ys whyte Delightful , when spoken , and so stripped of the mock medievalism ( the last line suggesting to me an awareness of trees on limestone hills hung with the autumn grey of Old Man 's Beard ) ; but it was too early for Chatterton to have sensed much of his world , for whatever ends , or to have individualized his rhythms within a more or less final range ? in short to have become himself in his freedom . So in extenso he remains about the most tedious poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , if we accept the not very strong reasons advanced in this edition , for depriving him of his " Last Verses " , the scorning lines which begin Farewell , Bristolia 's dingy piles of brick , Lovers of Mammon , worshippers of Trick ! Ye spurned the boy who gave you antique lays , And paid for learning with your empty praise . Farewell , ye guzzling , aldermanic fools , By nature fitted for Corruption 's tools . For me , he keeps those Last Verses . But in all his affair with posterity the laugh , I hurry to add , is n't at all on Chatterton , who could have matured into a great poet . The laugh is on the // everlasting philistinism which does not care for poetry , but likes a poet to illustrate proverbial sentiments such as genius fulfilled , or poet even in rags , or vision in the dirt , or raffish yet wonderful : the licensed miracles of Bohemia . The condition ( serve them right for having talent ) is death , as early as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nasty as possible , Keats screaming above the Spanish Steps , Dylan Thomas in a drunken coma in a New York hospital , or Chatterton taking his forlorn , excruciating arsenic . Then the emotions roused can be reflected on to the poems , exaggerating their merit or distorting them , causing them at any rate to be read in a wrong way . The perhaps ultimate laugh has to fall , when all else has dissipated , on such gross obesity of scholarship , such an overweight of the solemn and irrelevant as informs and has created this edition of 1265 pages , after two hundred years . I do not quarrel with Wordsworth ? Chatterton with his energy and his hawk 's eye was the marvellous boy ; and willing allowance does have to be made for the infections of a romantic , Gothic , and until lately Ossianic milieu . I do not quarrel with Keats , the major Chattertonian ( Keats is in some ways what Chatterton might have become ) , saying over and over to himself the last stanza of what I shall insistently call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I quarrel with Wallis , the more or less Pre-Raphaelite painter , for giving us ( it was in 1856 , Rossetti was n't over , Swinbume was yet to come ) that delightfully improbable portrait of Chatterton ? or George Meredith as Chatterton ? lying dead in his bright breeches ( after which Wallis went off with Mrs Meredith ) . But now it really is two hundred years , two hundred years and one , since Chatterton killed himself ; time enough ? 0 ! noatte the Halexandryne ? for a final reassertion of good sense . At least matters can be tidied up now with the help of this rather monstrous , unnecessary , bicentenary excess of labour , paper and publishing . 1971 Noaks is No Fool I propose to say some unfriendly things about George Steiner 's book ' because ( though it may command respect at this point and that ) it 's not a companion I should care to go strolling with , arm in arm , through mild October sunshine . It appears on the whole an ingenious piece of opportunism . Certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its writer being no fool , his book ( though he is less cautious when writing letters on the subject ) is not a plain assault on Eliot for the small j in jew . A continuum of four lectures in Eliot 's memory , it regrets that Eliot was n't so far-sighted into the future , so deep-sighted into modernity , so well-informed about the sciences , as George Steiner . But it genuflects ( indeed it bows and bows in most directions ? though more of that in a minute ) . Also this book ? or booklet ? is not a critique of literature , except in some unfortunate passages . It is Some Notes ? " my sub-title is of course intended in memoration of Eliot 's Notes of 1948 " ? Towards the Re-definition of Culture . Literature is only a part of culture : in culture , let 's say in " the cultural situation " , a phrase rather closer to a Steiner-ism than I care to go , gas-ovens may be found ; or the dream of socialism ; or the jettisoning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source . Or the problem of the elite and the mass ; or the electronic musicalization of the young ; or the assertions of McLuhan . Or the vanishing of confidence . Considering culture , which remains so imperfectly defined when he has finished groaning through its purlieus , George Steiner is certain of one thing : we have lost it , pro tem ; perhaps for ever . He does end by allying himself , in an unexpected , I thought slightly ingratiating way , with Nietzsche , with his Ewiges Ja des Seins , his Eternal Yes to Existence ; we must go on , we are truth-addicts , we must open Bluebeard 's last door , whatever is revealed . But he says emphatically , tolling his bell , that we live now in a " post-culture " , not powered , not dignified any more by that humane confidence which drove us forward for so long . He has something there ; he is best on this dilemma of lost confidence : 1 In Bluebeard 's Castle by George Steiner ( 1971 ) . // Not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we now know was a formidable privilege . In the generations from Voltaire to Arnold , absence of such knowledge was not innocence , but rather an enabling programme for civilization . But even that short paragraph appears shot with contradiction , assumption , or untruth . Cultured man , fully cultured man , if he could exist , would n't have inhuman potentialities . But he ca n't exist . Beating his bosom about modern imperfection , at times it is as if George Steiner had forgotten the Cain of the scriptures of his own people , arguing that human imperfection is now more imperfect than hitherto . The gas-ovens , the heaps of ash . Of course , we have found out about ourselves , our motivation , our " God " ? at any rate his time-servers ; we know it is nonsense to propound any more , for instance , the ineluctability of the rich man in his castle and the poor man at his gate ( though were Voltaire and Arnold so deficient in that particular knowledge ? ) . So acting " as if ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propel society ? or maintain a culture . When George Steiner moves to assertions about our " postculture " , I smell , all the same , a partiality for horror-stuff , for conceited self-immolation , which insensitizes him to the history of the previous enormities of all times and societies . He picks his evidence from a mass of horror which is , in fact , quantitatively , not relatively , more ; owing to the increased numbers of man ; owing to man 's increased ability to count and classify . I do n't know that there is much to choose ? each employing what was open to him ? between Hitler and a Fulke Nera of the Middle Ages ; and if Eliot did spell Jew with a small j in his poems , is n't that an improvement , in our everlasting imperfectibility , on the record of the poets Spenser or Ralegh in Ireland , or on Ronsard vis-a-vis the Protestants in those filthy wars of religion which soared to the Massacre of St Bartholomew ? And on The Merchant of Venice ? And is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no time ever was , or ever was felt to be , so rotten , precarious , and doomed as our own ? Of course , you do n't ? entirely ? catch out George Steiner in any risky proposition . He is a very clever man ( in which he reminds me of one very clever man in a Cornish town , whose story can wait for a paragraph or two ) . He is prodigiously informed ( a fact his writing parades ) . If some colleague of his told me that , between anthropology , linguistics and // archaeology , he kept a triple diary in Tupi-Guarani , Old Friesian , and Tocharian , I would believe it . He is adroit in these essays ; you think , " I 've got him , " and up he comes with your own objection . Am I being motivated personally ? " I 've got him , " and up he comes with your Could I be exaggerating ? Or misinterpreting ? But was it ever different ? Of course " there is a good deal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion for the environment . Nevertheless " .... Of course ( you are just going to complain about his line-by-line performance ) " never have the metalanguages of the custodians flourished more , or with more arrogant jargon " . Very deprecatory . But to come up with the objections is n't to correct the earlier , or subsequent , conclusions and suggestions , which are not infrequently ridiculous . I say ridiculous seriously , finding I have to apply to the modes of this distinguished polymath , in this piece , my Cornish story of Mr Noaks , who was also magisterial ( a magistrate , to be sure ) . Though clever , Noaks did odd things , he dug a hole in the garden and buried the cat , and called it " planting the cat " . Curious thing for a magistrate to do , but Noaks was a very clever man . He set two coach wheels running down the street into a crockery shop . Curious thing for a magistrate to do , but Noaks is no fool , Noaks is a very clever man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Quaker and make him drunk and wheel him through the streets in a wheelbarrow . No , I am not impugning the cleverness of Noaks . I only find it excessively curious ? and ridiculous ? when he explains anti-Semitism and concentration camps by saying they are Western Man 's revenge for having had foisted upon him simultaneities of a Sadian sexual assault , we have a brilliantly exact figure of the division of labour on the factory floor " ; ridiculous when he groans that " the African masks which grimace out of post-Cubic art are borrowings of and for despair " . Etcetera . Ingratiating , and opportunist . The charge embraces many items , from the words in this book , so arthritically combined , to all that they deliver . " There is a comprehensive decline in traditional ideals of literate speech . " There is ; and in George Steiner 's exceptionally illiterate manipulation it begins in such phrases as " plea for order " , " the note of Locksley Hall can be heard " , " Intimations of a sense of distant catastrophe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustration . He needs in his argument to mention the French revolutionary time , the increase and ordering of factory life , the conviction of progress , the poet vis-a-vis such things . So we get ? need you ask ? ? bliss was it to be alive , the Satanic mills , the poet as unacknowledged legislator , Macaulay on progress , Yeats 's darkening flood on which the swan is now drifting . Such enlarging units are combined with just the proper references for now , a little genuflection to Sylvia Plath , a nod to Hugh MacDiarmid , at his most vapid ; or to Borges , or Nabokov , or Canetti , or Ezra P. True , with this ingratiation are mixed sentences , pages even , of semi-opaque and barbarous abstraction ; different properties , it must be , of the same hand . Yet on the whole it is the ingratiatory which prevails . Within a structure of diverse name-dropping , I detect ? no , I do n't detect , it is too large to be missed ? an excursus designed to fit both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; designed to be Snow and Leavis ; designed as well to fit an at present de rigueur model of the catastrophic . I see what sermons Friar Steiner would have preached to anxious congregations in a packed church hall in the fifteenth century , before ordering a two-tiered monument for himself with the exemplary worms and toads of stone on his underlying cadaver . That was n't ? quite ? the cadaverous image I have been intending . As I read , it was the Piltdown Skull I thought about . These four essays are not so elegant a construction as the Skull , they wo n't last so well . But they are equally conjured to respond to a situation , or situations ; and to the catch-phrases of vulgar shorthand by which situations are indicated . The Piltdown Skull turning up in the Sussex gravel , responded to the situation which demanded " The Missing Link " . In Bluebeard 's Castle , turning up in Canterbury , in the University of Kent , responds to our catch-phrases of the Two Cultures , and Generations Divided , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I can not estimate George Steiner in his mash of well-trodden Snow and Mathematics , I can fairly estimate him in his mash of Leavis and Letters and Readers ; about which plenty ( beyond his way , his tone , of writing ) could be advanced to show that Noaks , though no fool , is singularly unattuned to the substances and contrivances of verbal art , in poems especially . Witness the verbal slop which he makes of translating his high piece from Nietzsche ( no less than the kind of thing he chose so often for his Penguin Book of Modern Verse // Translation a few years ago ) or his proof , via Lycidas , that most Western literature of the past two thousand years or more " is now passing quickly out of reach " . The latter I praise as one of our time 's more risible offerings of academic buffoonery. 1971 . A Kind of Blankness ? In Scott 's Journal , republished lately , I came across this about Wordsworth : " Wordsworth has a system which disposes him to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which right or wrong will always be the taste of the public , yet he could be popular if he would . " And this : " I was glad to see my old friend whose conversation has so much that is fresh and manly in it . I do not at all acquiesce in his system of poetry and I think he has injured his own fame by adhering to it . " In looking through a book of drawings I came on one by Rowlandson of a timid author with thin shanks standing by a supercilious publisher with a big belly on fat legs : his sales were evidently low . In a new book on Giovanni Verga , I find Verga writing in a letter that " we have to stay in this via crucis of ours beset with vexations and publishers " ; and in another letter about the failure of I Malavoglia ? " a total and complete fiasco " ? that even his publishers said outright it was bad , that people avoided him as if he had committed a sin , and he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , and that he needed all the strength of his convictions " to refrain from writing those silly niceties which please the public ? and to laugh behind their backs afterwards " . So I ask myself , looking round , what is the nature of a public ? For ourselves , as for successful Scott ? And for more or less unsuccessful Wordsworth , and , elsewhere , more or less unsuccessful Giovanni Verga ? I ask myself if that dead and good man Sir Walter Scott , who flashed a proper independence now and then inside his doggy dependence , did n't express in those few comments about Wordsworth an English situation which is n't constant , but does certainly repeat itself ? " He could be popular if he would . " " He has injured his own fame . " Wiggle your tail , Wordsworth , for the public biscuit . Worry about your fame . Alter yourself , my manly friend . It is as much as to say ? it is always being said , it is , in 1972 , as ever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please is the immediate one . This thoroughly amiable , voluminous scribbler from the Lowlands would like no one to avoid him as if his latest romance had been the commission of a sin . He is n't cynical , but a timeless public does not interest him . He conforms . And the kernel of the immediate public he conforms to is , more narrowly , that self-regarding club of those " in power " . Scott is // parroting and sharing a club reaction to contrary Wordsworth ; he is saying to himself ? himself the natural amateur and outsider ? that the professional should acquiesce ( which , alas , Wordsworth , the grand professional , the grand insider , had already done in his Waterloo Odes and would do again when ? let some present consciences be in ferment ? he sealed his concluding self as Poet Laureate , and Lost Leader ) . I read that F. R. Leavis talks of the literary present , in his new book , as a kind of " blankness " : which may n't be untrue . It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1840s , of which Beddoes complained ; the slack after-war dimness in which Mrs Hemans and L. E. L. were approved reading . But in this , as always , what we require is n't " leaders " , unlost : or Leavises . In the wide society , also in the restricted society of letters , the lucky thing is to have enough mature or maturing authors whose loyalty , let these authors be various as they may , is evidently and always to the best ; and whose reputation and influence are such as to compel that powerful club , which ca n't be eradicated , to something of an identical sense of worth . It is that unhomogeneous body of principled writers , aware of the past as of the present , that we do n't have . We had it for a while some forty years ago . A diversity of intellectual passion ( the effective remembered discrimination of James ; then Yeats , Joyce , Russell , Lewis , Eliot , Forster , Graves , Auden ) afforded more referents than are now compellingly available . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not important , though not unrepresentative . If there were such writers the weak would be less soured and narrowed by the commination and pulpitry of Leavis . If there were such writers , we should be in no doubt about the vital irrelevance of , e.g. , the good Lord Snow . If there were such writers ( of course the ones I have mentioned still are ; we still have their writings ; two of them are still about ; I am emphasizing what the active force would be of such a miscellaneous presence ) , then the amateur could less easily strut as the professional , the journalist would be less cocky about what he thinks is his own judgment . If there were such writers , academics and art officials ( the Arts Council , the BBC , etc. ) also would , or could , be less bullying , less fly-witted , less obedient to vulgar notions of what is both earnest and energetic in new writing . If there were such writers , it might be possible that a Royal Society of Literature would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the good Lords // Butler and Birkenhead ( that still egregious society , I see , was too much even for Sir Walter ? " I do not belong to the Society . . . I do n't like your Royal Academies of this kind ; they almost all fall into jobs and the Members are seldom those who do credit to the literature of a country " ) ; and it might be that a newspaper , The Times , would n't confuse the wider society , in its literary values , by allotting three close columns of obituary and fulsomeness to a Maurice Bowra where ( but that was years ago ) it disposed of the red beard and reputation and living works of awkward D. H. Lawrence in a quarter of a column . If there were such writers , we might in England be at least checked in our Late Athenian vice of whoring after the new long before yesterday 's new is old , cold , or absorbed ; we might act more , or discern more , by a proper contemporaneity of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism from its now absurd theological dominance . In short , were there such writers ? enough of them , loosely associated ? then the proper writers might be acknowledged to be in charge of their own art . That would be a change . We might also be released then , I forgot to say , from a plague of little magazines related only to the self-regard of their editors , and from a prodigious plague of idle incompetent poets , off our own muckheaps , and imported ; of all sizes , in every milieu from St Ives to the Cotswolds or the Poetry Society , or the public poetry reading , or the English departments of the new universities . That example of Scott , best of men in so many ways , but not of writers , may warn us , also , against a constant insidiousness . Intelligent , friendly , half-interested , yes : he even knew where his limits ran ( as in his confession about Jane Austen and her talent for " the involvements and feelings and characters of ordinary life " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like any now going but the exquisite touch which renders ordinary commonplace things and characters interesting from the truth of the description and the sentiment is denied to me " ) . Turn to him on Wordsworth ? his friend , he insists , the poet who asks for the exercise of sensibility and intellect and just a little trouble ; or turn to him on an evening with Coleridge : he fails in witness ; even when alone , in his journal . English literary association ? all literary association ? ? is full of these genial fellows . They face every way . They do n't undress in private ( read , in Harold Nicolson 's diary , the entries on a meal with Joyce , and a meal with Andre Gide ) . But you // can not abolish them . That is the Leavisite morality , and fallacy , and naivete ? that they would n't be here , if only our condition could be one of health . You can inoculate yourself against them , that is all , by an unremitting committal to as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too ; in whatever writing ways your living has to be earned . I conclude that in our recent decades , a bad moment for ourselves was when Auden left for the United States . It does seem from a distance that over there he has been the nucleus for an honesty , intelligence and subtlety which have enabled one not necessarily remarkable talent to help another . Whereas in England , in my writing time , unaffined talents have often hindered each other . They have been too easily shouldered out . They have fraternized with the genial fellows ( this is sometimes called mellowing ) . The result ? weakness , fragmentation , isolation , disagreement , confusion , lack of nerve and the whole insolence of a literary underworld . * * * The Mob : thank you , sane Alexander Pope , for that summarizing word , though now it is n't only gents who write with the intolerable fecundity of Ease .

But listen : " Bird shit is nature 's protest in Egypt : she decorates monuments with it instead of with lichen or moss . " Flaubert , everywhere at home , is no tourist . Flaubert swims in the Red Sea : " It was one of the most voluptuous pleasures of my life ; I lolled in its waters as though I were lying on a thousand liquid breasts that were caressing my entire body . " Flaubert is Flaubert , not someone else afloat on accepted observations . With a slight amazement , but no exclamation marks , with an eye ruthless or neutral , or at least steady , Flaubert contemplates peculiarity , perversion , corruption . " Tiger-striped hoopoes with long beaks peck at the worms in the various corpses , " which are those of camels , horses and donkeys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English family , ludicrous , the mother looks like a sick old parrot ( because of the green eyeshade attached to her bonnet ) .

Their nauseating odour mingled with the scent of her skin , which was dripping with sandalwood oil .

" No one will forget the holy man who walked about " completely naked except for a cap on his head and another on his prick .

One is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the busy Maxime du Camp , for ever setting up his camera and photographing Abu Simbel or the Sphinx . Flaubert complains to his notebook : " This permanent lassitude that I drag about with me . " But then boredom , at that age , can contradictorily be a kind of medium in which impressions are achieved , nourished and fixed . The embroidery bits out of Maxime du Camp are as unelectric as can be . As Flaubert said afterwards , when Du Camp began serializing his Egyptian recollections , the trouble was less a style " flat beyond words " , than a total insignificance , " nothing in the way of meat , nothing really observed " . Flaubert observed all dimensions of what attracted him with all senses ; he was nearer to the truth of himself when he wrote to his mother : " I live like a plant , filling myself with sun and light , with colours and fresh air . I keep eating , so to speak ; afterwards the digesting will have to be done , then the shitting , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important thing . " No , an English author , in or after 1850 , never did , never could , write like that . If the senses were n't closed ( though perhaps they were for the appropriate seconds ) , the words were not able to come and could not be set down ? even , as a rule , in private . English authors could manage the glowing Nile ? Lear , for instance , in " The Pelican Chorus " , as well as in purple watercolours : Where the purple river rolls fast and dim And the Ivory Ibis starlike skim . So could Flaubert ? " At six in the evening a sunset that made the sky look like melted vermilion and the sand of the desert like ink " ? but those bed-bugs demanded an entry which in England they could have effected only in some sanitary report by Edwin Chadwick . For the English situation one remembers Henry James ( for all his reticence , which is n't quite the same thing , or the same drawback ) discussing in George Eliot 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent by which the abstract preceded the perceived ; and in Flaubert 's art and nature the opposite , so that Madame Bovary was " adapted for the reverse of what is called family reading " . If the members of the family had n't changed , we should not have Mr Steegmuller 's Flaubert in Cairo and along the Nile . A Bottle of Brandy in Spitzbergen How is Coleridge now received ? ' In a book about him or derived from him , of the kind which stifles me because it exalts Coleridge as the Christian exegete , and so reduces him as a poet , Basil Willey quotes him on the " truths " of religion ? that they are ( or were in his time ) so impressed on people in childhood that they grew up taking them for granted . We grow up taking Coleridge for granted . We read Kubla Khan ( which he published only with reluctance as a " psychological curiosity " , but that is Coleridge 's business , not ours ) , we read The Ancient Mariner , we embrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dismayed , since we do n't encounter it , for more of the same kind . In the end we take to Dejection , we learn of Coleridge holding Sara Hutchinson 's hand by the Buttermere waterfall ( perhaps recalling that entry in his early notebook " Mem ? not to adulterize my time by absenting myself from my wife " ? that tedious querulous wife he had been so ill-advised as to marry ) ; and we too regret his loss of the shaping spirit of imagination ? O Lady ! we receive but what we give And in our life alone does Nature live . All the while ? it ca n't and it should n't be evaded ? we do accept him as half of the dichotomous poetical term ColeridgeWordsworth , discovering the exact truth of all Coleridge wrote in exaltation of Wordsworth and his poems . Taking to Wordsworth , we may think of drudging through those abominable double columns of Coleridge 's green jacketed Poetical Works , mentally straightening all those turned-over lines , and never finding ? on the outside of the familiar enclosure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match " Among all lovely things my love had been " or when against the wind she strains Oh ! might I kiss the mountain rains That sparkle on her cheek . ? lyrics in which the love in Coleridge might have been able to detach itself ( from thought ? ) , and exclaim in such a free ecstasy . Samuel Taylor Coleridge by Basil Willey ( 1972 ) . // With regret , since our first excitement from poetry so much conies out of Kubla Khan , our first sense of the precariousness of the wonderful is also impressed on us by the person from Porlock ; and it is the worse if we come on Wordsworth saying about Coleridge that if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the channel of poetry , an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery . . . he might have done more permanently to enrich literature , and to influence the thought of the nation , than any man of his age . Might have done , might have been : they do remain epitaphs above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Earl Grigg 's great edition of his letters ' are evidence of that ? unless you accept all of the now fashionable justification for Coleridge which has produced Basil Willey 's book . Here is Coleridge in the ultimate of his life cocooned in Highgate . His childen , and Sara Hutchinson , as they long had been , are elsewhere . Wordsworth and Dorothy ? or what was left of them ? are far away in the north . Only one of the 1,819 letters is to Wordsworth . Few are to poets , or concerned in extenso with poetry or the imaginative process . Few are to correspondents intellectually or emotionally up to him ; ailments apart , he is obsessed with his metaphysics , one 's response to which depends on whether one continues to see the Christian faith as " the perfection of human intelligence " , and whether one continues to feel that the metaphysical is the one possible foundation of the imaginative act . In 1800 ? Basil Willey quotes this ? Coleridge had written that while Wordsworth was " a great , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Metaphysician " . He was constant . Analysing himself in one of the new letters , he claims that constancy , or continuity ? " the Love , almost the Passion , for the Permanent : and the tranquil Complacency in Beauty , as distinguished from the Interesting , the Agreeable , the Delicious " ? is the characteristic quality and property of his being ( whereas his original sin is " Excess of Power with Deficiency of Strength " ) . Basil Willey again ( he admits that the metaphysician rose as the poet diminished ) quotes Coleridge at twenty-four in a P.S. to revolutionary Thelwall , " We have a hundred lovely scenes about Bristol , which would make you 1 // exclaim 0 admirable Nature ! and me , 0 Gracious God . " The Highgate Coleridge , anxious , yet without hope of doing so , to complete that " System of Truths respecting Nature , Man and Deity , evolved from one Principle " , can say lightly that : in this bleak World of Mutabilities , and where what is not changed is chilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I resemble a Bottle of Brandy in Spitzbergen ? a Dram of alcoholic Fire in the centre of a Cake of Ice . But he admits to himself that in " life unendeared " he can not write poems . Is it fair to harp on his loss of shaping power , on what might have been , in one shape or another ? In a way , no ; Coleridge , as we can see now from the progressive , appallingly belated publication of all his works , having created , understood , and stated so much . A little sharply he reports an observation by his brother-in-law Southey ; Southey claimed to hunt by eye ; Southey saw his object , he dashed for it straight , whereas Coleridge hunted with his nose to the earth , tracked his hare or fox through every zigzag , catching only the scent , never the object . " It is a mistake , " added Coleridge , to suppose , that the end is in all cases higher than the means : or that the means always derive their whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By Coleridge we are given means in prodigious quantity and quality . As poet I suppose he must remain the properest poet of the young , in the few necessary poems . Perhaps Earl Griggs would admit that . I remember him beginning work on the letters , living in a single room in a smelly row opposite Carrera 's Egyptian factory , himself young and penetrated by the Kubla Khan wonderfulness ( it was the time of Livingstone Lowe 's Road to Xanadu ) . Whatever else he has since recognized in the vast terra incognita ( as it then was , considerably ) of S.T.C. , I imagine it is that wonderfulness which has driven him through forty years of editorial slogging . As for " means " , nose to the ground , so much combines to make Coleridge that exemplar of the species which he continues to be , after all , for the English or the Americans in their Legenda Aurea of verse ?

Meanwhile , out of these last of the six volumes of correspondence , two notes for ourselves , and for all who imagine a former ( or a present ) genuine gusto for poetry , and all who fancy they are in rapport with the contemporary best . The ? 50 offered him in his last decade for two poems was more profit , Coleridge says , than all of his publications had made him ; and it was his conviction that good poetry is never popular , is never " honoured with the praise and favour of contemporaries " , except in the sense of amusing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any deep emotion " . 1972 A Hole Worlde of Thinges Very Memorable : The Writer and His Territory I would n't be dogmatic on the advantages a writing man may or must derive , now , from a consciousness of his own territory , or a territory he adopts for a while . We have at least to be born somewhere , we become aware of the facts of a surrounding world , as we grow up , aware , in high degree , of some particular locality , the Puisaye for Colette , the Orenburg country for Aksakov , for Whitman the Long Island of herds , waves , gulls ' eggs and men who fished for green-backed spotted mossbonkers , for Eliot his native city of St Louis , rawedged by the dirty flow of the Missouri , for Auden the Long Mynd , for Langland the Malverns , and so on . Place obviously matters to a writer as long as he does not stay there exclusively , I mean as long as in his writing he is there and elsewhere . Regionalism is something else : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose to travel , or a debasement thrust on writers by readers or promoters . In England it has always been fascinating to watch the pinning of Hardy into a region . " Wessex " was Hardy 's own fault , he did draw the map . However he gets free , although sentimentalists peg it round him like a net . A " regional " novelist strictly , a " regional " poet , of " local interest " , is a novelist or poet of no importance and no interest , fit only for subsidy by the Arts Council ( who ever thought of a philosopher of " local interest " ? As if Hobbes were of interest only to the people of North Wiltshire , or to August visitors to Malmesbury ? ) . The question is whether his special locality is inside or outside the writer ; and even in that greater context it may be asked if a literature about place , literature of any real kind in which place predominates , is any more possible ? I doubt if it is , except within limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that way , to inquire , Can a book about place , other than some late issue out of Guidebook by Essay , be contrived any longer in such a way as to raise the individual , the local , the regional , towards the universal ? , may illuminate modem writing . One may think together of landscape and this literature of place ( which may be verse , fiction or topography ) . The two // have risen together , not pari passu , and with the differences proper to different arts , one the youngish parent ? or godparent ? of the other . Literature of place , prompted first of all by the vision outwards of Northern , especially Flemish painting , has expressed discovery . The first discovery was , simply , that place or region existed . Once that was clear , individual discovery of place was possible to each new individual consciousness . From Leland , let 's say , to a climax in Henry James , place could be expressed , and with increasing subtlety be made expressive . The English and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from about 1539 to 1543 , resulting in The Itinerary , in a book , at any rate a long scatter of notes and observations , which , ordinary and bare as they may seem to us , stated the diversely existing things of England and Wales : there is almoste nother cape , nor bay , haven , creke or peere , river or confluence of rivers , breches , waschis , lakes , meres , fenny waters , montagnes , valleis , mores , hethes , forestes , wooddes , cities , burges , castelles , principale manor placis , monasteries , and colleges , but I have scene them ; and notid yn so doing a hole worlde of thinges very memorable . " A hole worlde of thinges " ? it is prototopography by a first English topographer or topographical writer ( for " topography " and " topographer " as naturalized words the first dates in the OED are for the one 1549 , for the other 1603 . The date in French for topographic is 1544 ; for topographe 1580 , in Montaigne , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poet in Latin , friend and encomiast of Sir Thomas Wyatt , and a man of educated peculiarity , true it certainly is that Leland was unable to command a prose adequate to the particulars of his " hole worlde " . Nobody has thought of his notes as literature , ancestral to the books of place , to Thoreau 's Walden , it may be , or William Morris 's Icelandic journals ; but he responds , he states a vision now and then . For a sample try Leland coming to Bewdley , a place in 1972 miserable , pressurized and shabby enough . Leland crosses over the bridge from the eastern bank of the Severn , about sunrise . He observes a town " set on the syd of an hill so coningly that a man can not wishe to set a towne better " , and he goes on that Bewdley risethe from Severne banke by est upon the hill by west ; so that a man standinge on the hill trans pontem by est may // descrive almost every howse in the towne , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gliterithe , being all of new buyldinge , as it wer of gold . It is a beginning ; and in the half century or century after Leland the shire surveyors exhibit the young consciousness of surroundings in something more of an expressive way . Richard Carew ( another poet friendly , at least as an undergraduate , with better poets , and a man of subtle education and strong local affection ) exhibits Richard Carew , if without intending to , in his Survey of Cornwall . The Survey ? he was already working on it by 1584 ? endures as more than of local interest by its fixation and creation of place in a baroque activity of style . We remember his delight in tidal water flowing into the country between hills and ebbing again into the sea , and in the union of the two streams , the salt and the fresh : The salt water leaving Padstow floweth up into the country that it may embrace the river Camel , and having performed this natural courtesy , ebbeth away again to yield him the freer passage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longest , strongest and fairest that the shire can muster . Headlands " shoulder " out of the sea , a fishing hamlet " couches " between hills . In passing along Hall Walk , above Fowey harbour , your eyes shall be called away from guiding your feet , to descry by their farthest kenning the vast ocean sparkled with ships that continually this way trade forth and back to most quarters of the world . Nearer home , they take view of all sized cocks , barges , and fisherboats , hovering on the coast . Between Carew and Henry James , the James of Dunwich ? " almost all you can say of it is that it consists of the mere letters of its old name . The coast , up and down , for miles , has been , for more centuries than I presume to count , gnawed away by the sea . All the grossness of its positive life is now at the bottom of the German Ocean , which moves for ever , like a ruminating beast , an insatiable , indefatigable lip " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosom as a gaming table ; card-tables , billiard-tables are but a humble imitation of Newmarket Heath " ; the James of Lavender Hill , Battersea , " so many rows of coal-scuttles " , of all London in the sound that is " supremely dear to the consistent London-lover ? the rumble of the tremendous human will " ; ? between the Survey of Cornwall and English Hours , Portraits of Places , A Little Tour in // France and The American Scene , milieu offered stylistic possibilities of stated contrast and actual discovery , whether far off or round the corner . The few quotations above show the Carew of the 1580s and 1590s and the James of the 1870s and 1880s as belonging ? in regard to place at least ? to one family of writers , with the difference that Carew 's pictures are intermittent in his broad context of information and Henry James 's , in his sketches of place , are extended , amounting to a developed verbal landscape , at a time when painted landscape was approaching its demise . Contemporary with Monet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deprecatingly of his own impressionism : his pieces are " altogether governed by the pictorial spirit " ; they are " impressions , immediate , easy , and consciously limited " ; but still like Carew ( or Leland even ) he discovers , as a rule : his pages " represent a stage of observation on the writer 's part which belongs to freshness of acquaintance " . For James , Europe was a perpetual discovery outside America ; Stonehenge or Dunwich was a discovery outside London , engagingly alien to drawing-rooms or Chelsea or the Reform Club ; for James himself we feel it was surprising to be in Monmouthshire climbing Skirrid Fach and commenting ( like Donne not so far away at Montgomery Castle ) on the size and quality of the primroses , just as for the reader of his English Hours it is surprising and engaging to discover the Master on the crawl , " very much in the attitude of Nebuchadnezzar " , up a rough hill at the extreme of England , on the confines of Celtic barbarity . But the conditions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books . He discovers what he himself does not know , and what , he assumes , will come more or less fresh , or unobliterated by familiarity , to his reader . Outside society exists another society ; outside the soiled exists the fresh ; outside the complex the more or less simple ; outside the existence of now , the seeming presence of then , or of the timeless . For Dorothy Wordsworth ? to recall more writers of place ? outside the small talk of sociability exists the Quantock copse of hollies , and hail pattering on the dry leaves , or the lakeland circumstances around a single foxglove ; for Cobbett , in his Rural Rides , outside detested London exists the sudden hanger of the Selborne neighbourhood or the smoothness of an extent of down ; for the happy egotism of Kilvert in his Journal , the other thing which matters may be the blue shoulder of Radnorshire mountain along with dog roses ; for // that sophisticated , neglected writer Cecil Torr human comedy and oddity coexist with the shapes and items of the setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each new consciousness . Even then the extended possibilities of place and contrast as a medium , actual or marginal ( one need not assent to that deprecation of himself by Henry James , who is inescapably " in " his pictures or impressions , and who did say that the " perception of surface " was " a perception , when fine , perhaps none of the most frequent " ) , have narrowed greatly , if they are not by now exhausted . For many reasons . A mode is overpopularized and cheapened , and talent recoils from it . What was expressive of writer and milieu weakened long ago to a lax exercise of sensitivity . For instance years and years ago , volumes of such slackness at a low level made up the Highways and Byeways volumes of county exploration . I remember when young trying one after another of those books ( which might have illustrations in line ? superior to the prose ? in a late landscape manner by F. L. Griggs or a more impressionist manner by Joseph Pennell , whose drawings were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his English Hours ) , and being unable to accept their flow of mild and vague response . No pause , no striking sentence , no phrases bringing fact into the open ( such as James 's observation up and down the now vanished quays of Nantes of " the bright greyness which is the tone of French landscape art " ) ; also no exactitude of other than conventional and stale information , only a replaying of old cards from earlier books . One could see the respectable , well-thought-of Macmillan men of letters snapshotting with their not very finely perceptive eyes , and turning up a Kelly 's Directory or a Murry 's Handbook , or picking and watering down engaging trifles from a county history in many volumes , or from Pepys ? especially from Pepys . To some degree the enlargement and popularization of other disciplines have weakened that kind of writing about place . More importantly a diminution of contrast , as between James 's park-embowered world . You may recall a number of the Architectural Review which illustrated the same graceless renovation and change stretching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The kerbs and pavements of planning officers ' suburbanization spread through the dominions of every rural district council , we live more and more without available contrast in a homogeneity either urban // or suburban . Like stair carpets , paths in the Lake District wear out , as if they were on Hampstead Heath . Should the litterateur of , or through , place extend his investigation and interpret more of the elsewhere ? Give us Mexico or Ethiopian uplands via himself , and himself via the outlandish ? He has tried : but even if the arts had not shifted towards abstraction , the place-book , or the place-touches of a novel , for example , would still impart best ? except for imparting the writer ? the unfamiliarities , not exactly of the familiar , but at least of the neighbouring ? that which is not too much outside our keepings , that which we half know , or have seen or can see ourselves if we take the trouble . James , it is true , liked to read of places he would never see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , writing about the East and Morocco and writing his stories ? provided him with " the happiest conceivable utterance of feelings about aspects " , he never wanted to spoil those impressions by a visit . But we go everywhere , we exhaust the terrain , familiar or far . And already , in 1888 , in another essay on his admired Pierre Loti than the one I have just referred to , James himself was asking " how long and how far accomplished and exclusive ? practically exclusive ? impressionism will yet go , with its vulture on its back and feeding on it " . Writer and painter are open to the same influences , but it is reasonable to suppose that written landscape will continue , however diminished , to outlast painted or drawn landscape . What the painter senses of his milieu is the material of an abstraction to the artist who uses words and language . So what I would expect is not the disappearance of a literature of place , but its more effective restriction to discontinuous forms . I expect more such writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English translation 1970 ) , the use , it is true , of the unfamiliar by someone who is both painter and poet , who changes in his brief book from prose to verse , and back again . Or I imagine something like notebook adaptations of the nikki of the Japanese poet , the travel-diary of linked poetry and prose ( of which an example easily come by is Basho 's Narrow Road to Oku , translated in a Penguin of 1966 by Nobuyuki Yuasa , and by Donald Keene in 1956 in his Anthology of Japanese Literature ) . 1972 Poets who Kill Themselves : The Extremists of Al Alvarez I can not find much in The Savage God ' which makes it worth prolonged consideration . Mr Alvarez states that he has written a " study of suicide " . His publishers state that he has tried to discover why people commit suicide . But I detect ? and for this I do not require to be much of a Maigret ? two authors in the same Alvarez , as here exhibited ; and two books . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was educated at Oundle School , and Corpus Christi College , Oxford , where he obtained a first-class degree in English " ) has exploratory concerns or prime interests of a literary-sociological kind which centre upon a quartet of contemporary poets , and a postulated style he calls Extremism , shaped by the internal features of the present casting-mould , the present " situation " . His poets , " the four leading English-language exponents of the style " , are , as we know perhaps too well , the three Americans Robert Lowell , John Berryman and Sylvia Plath , and Sylvia Plath 's husband and relict , Ted Hughes . The other Alvarez is the bookman , the promoter and journalizes of his interests or concerns ; and if a book is to be made ? the journalist or journalizer taking over ? it is likely that more readers will be attracted by the " situation " than by a close consideration of the favoured poets or their poems ; and still more , if the " situation " can be subsumed and proffered in one of its morbidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But conveniently one of the favoured poets can share the lead , since she obligingly wrote about suicide , and even more obligingly committed it ; and since her story has become the object of a cult ( " Anything by or about Sylvia Plath goes down well on these heights " ? report from Hampstead in The Bookseller , 25 December 1971 , on " Christmas in the Bookshops " ) . Mr Alvarez , who has so pushed and so over-valued the poems of Sylvia Plath , can say in his prologue that they are now classics , that he and none other introduced them to a Sunday paper , that he himself knew the poet , in life ; and in death , on the kitchen floor ? " The builders forced the lock and found Sylvia sprawled in the kitchen . She was still warm " ? and in her coffin " She lay // stiffly , a ludicrous ruff at her neck . Only her face showed . It was grey and slightly transparent , like wax " ( all of which would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's husband not protested ) . The book , accordingly , begins by mixing sensationalism and concern , which it continues to do in other respects , until the reader requires a separator to divide the two , or to divide Alvarez from Alvarez . He may remember , as he turns the handle , after adjusting the disparate buckets or the bowl and the bucket , that this critic has written of his indifference to the palpability around him ; and if he should have looked ahead from the prologue to the epilogue , the reader may also be remembering that Mr Alvarez confesses himself to be " a failed suicide " , a fact which gives him a special personal investment , we may suppose , in his notions of external and internal violence , and Extremism . His notions ? When the last fluid ounce has passed through the machine , much of the rather small bowl of resultant cream will be found to be tinned rather than fresh , after all ; to be an altered and I would say debased borrowing from Camus on the Absurd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and creating dangerously . Here then is the scheme of the book . First , in that prologue , Sylvia Plath , who must be shown to have been less a pathological suicide than a bold explorer of the purlieus of death into which she was tempted , always in ultimate control , always taking an explorer 's risk which at last ( in that London house where Yeats had once lived ) proved to be too great ? Sylvia Plath sensationalized beyond the business either of his readers or Mr Alvarez . Then filling the greater part of The Savage God , a survey of conceptions and misconceptions of suicide and of the ways in which suicide has impressed itself on the thought and feeling and judgement of writers from Dante onwards ( these are surveys of an averagely acute but secondary amateurism such as one might find in the lighter pages of New Society ) ; finally , an exposition in more detail of the Extremism of Mr Alvarez , which is the controlled exploration , through art , of " the nihilism and destructiveness of the self " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies " . The " best modern artists " survive , if they avoid killing themselves , as " suicides of the imagination : they are scapegoats on our behalf " , each " finds himself in testing out his own death and vulnerability " ; and the modern art " forces its audience to recognize and accept , in their nerve-ends , not the facts of life Poets who Kill Themselves : The Extremists of Al Alvarez 95 but the facts of death and violence ; absurd , random , gratuitous , unjustified and inescapably part of the society we have created . " " Not the facts of life " : Mr Alvarez signs off ( though still to come is his little ingratiating epilogue on how he failed to manage his own suicide ) by quoting Camus in his remark " There is only one liberty , to come to terms with death . After which , everything is possible . " This is neat . It will be remembered , however , that Camus , who rejected suicide ( and murder ) , declared , " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Absurd . Camus did n't stop with the nihilism or with the liberty , he went on to what the liberty makes possible and essential . For example , " Happiness and the absurd are the two sons of the same earth . They are inseparable . " Or , " We must simultaneously serve suffering and beauty . " In the heartening light of Camus , of L'Homme Revolte and Le Mythe de Sisyphe , this journalizing author of The Savage God seems to me to be indulging in the violence and the chaos : he offers a bucket mainly of skim-milk which is black and poisonous ? and no wonder , with the obscene carrion-crow of the fancy of Ted Hughes perched on the rim . From the first page the writing accords ; it is vulgar and execrable , half assertive , half ingratiating , if fluent . " We sat out in the big wild garden while little Frieda , now aged two , teetered among the flowers " . The writing proceeds by flaccid cliche , by the language of the blind and deaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an assortment of " worlds apart " , " genius " , " sheer ability " , " success story " , " genuine article " , etcetera , which makes one call Camus back once more , asking " If we are not artists in our language first of all , what kind of artists are we ? " , and which deprives such estimations as it may deliver of authority or plausibility . In any case I distrust a critic who analyses a zeitgeist more eagerly than he attends to a line or a cadence ; whose statements are too often careless ( for example , Modigliani did not kill himself , Cowper did not die in an asylum ) ; who is so uninventive that he can not invent his own titles ( the title of this book is purloined from Yeats , the title of the last book by Mr Alvarez was purloined from Marianne Moore , the title of his first book from Coleridge ) ; and who is led by the carrot of his own theory to enthuse over art where art does not noticeably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Tu Fu ? You have five seconds to answer . . . and if you say " I do n't know , " you have the entirely reasonable excuse that we have never been given all that chance to learn about Tu Fu . Try an encyclopaedia . Probably it will say that he was the greatest of China 's poets , the great master ? but this will not be so very illuminating ? of the eighth century AD of splendour and death , of empire and disaster and the rebellion of An Lu-shan . Then it will mention Li Po , his friend ; and we shall be in the picture . We know about Li Po , we know his mother called him Evening Star because she had dreamt , while she was carrying him , that the Evening Star had fallen into her lap . We know how Li Po was drowned ? he was drunk in a boat and the beauty of the moon 's image on the water overcame him so much that he tried to embrace it and fell in . We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for China 's Shakespeare , China 's Dante or Victor Hugo or Goethe in our rather haphazard , lopsided anthologies of Chinese verse , he is not there as a rule ; and we are usually told he does not translate . David Hawkes , Oxford 's professor of Chinese , says the same at the beginning of his Little Primer of Tu Fu : ' " His poems do not as a rule come through very well in translation " . I wonder . Knowing no Chinese , classical or modern Mandarin , I have the nerve to wonder for one very good reason : whenever I do come across a translation from Tu Fu , I get the strongest feeling of his grand mastery and his individuality , of poetry in which life ? life , not Chinese life twelve hundred years ago ? is realized , through landscape or nature or situation , in an ageless way which seems particularly in tune with our English or European feelings ; and did n't someone claim that genius is what , in fact , comes through in translation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

A single Tern of the sandbanks In between earth and heaven . ? which is Tu Fu thinking about life and himself on a night journey down the Yangtze . In a way the great solemn Tu Fu is the excuse and not the subject of this delightful book . For years we have been used to a particular kind of English-Chinese poem ? the late Arthur Waley 's kind ? every poem , or every poet , made rather the same in a gentle , liberal , loose , tasteful English . We were given the mood , and denied the poems . This time we get the poems . I do not mean that we get perfect translations .

Yuan-yang bu du su Mandarin ducks not alone sleep . . . Mandarin ducks are a well-known symbol of conjugal fidelity . Last of all comes a straightforward crib , in prose , so the book adds up to a series of the pleasantest evening classes , or to a do-it-yourself kit . My only grouse is that Professor Hawkes ( who is not in the least pompous or professorial ) did not choose the poems by Tu Fu that he liked best . For various reasons he picked the thirty-five poems which appear in a kind of Chinese Golden Treasury . Some of them are obscure , some of them are poems ( illustrating a general difficulty of translation ) which can not really exist outside the original , outside a context of classical China .

It is cold , her blue sleeves are thin . In the failing Light she leans against the tall bamboos. 2 . THE TALE OF GENJI It takes forty chapters or so of one of the most admirable of novels to reach the death of Genji ? " The shining Genji was dead " , dead but deathless , the shining price who can never sink into oblivion . He has been alive now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in a new translation , ' the considerate , impeccable lover , roving yet faithful ; the Japanese prince of perfect beauty , perfect sensibility , perfect sensuality . He is impossible , yet in his unflawed perfection , in his adventures , his thoughts and feelings , he does exist . He is actual , he is real , he is human , he is credible . That credibility I would say is the first extraordinary fact about this master novel of world writing . It is all artifice , which means all art . And tied to this art and artificial reality is the second extraordinary fact ? that this vast novel is more than a thousand years young . It does not date . Written before our Norman Conquest , it never seems archaic . Everything about The Tale of Genji is remote , in space and in time and in culture , yet everything about it is here and now . If in this long dead world of the Heian Court in Japan there are set pieces , these public tableaux give way to private lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private company there are sad settings of the tilted moon in the western sky at dawn , when Genji and a girl separate . There was never a more poetic novel which at the same time is more filled with the here and now of action ? of poetic action .

How many dresses and fabrics are described , just a touch to make the scene . How many wreathings of mist there are , and wild skies , and whitenings of the sea across a bay . And the last extraordinary fact is how all this poetic here and now , all this marvellous immediacy walls the reader ; he is in , he is immersed , he is held . The pace , the tone , the texture ? they are all so good that of 1,100 pages not one , I think , is tedious . From another new book , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereabouts to 1867 , to the beginning of the modern era in Japanese life and literature , we may learn something of what the Japanese themselves have thought of Genji . One Japanese poet of Shakespeare 's time said that nothing gave him as much pleasure as Genji : " I have been reading it for over sixty years , and I never tire of it . " When he read it , he felt he was living in Genji 's time . In the eighteenth century one of the greatest of Japanese critics and scholars , Motoori Norinaga , called Genji " a tale of human life which leaves aside and does not profess to take up at all the question of good and bad , and which dwells only upon the goodness of those who are aware of the sorrow of human existence " . It is about illicit love affairs , yes ? but this " impure mud " in The Tale of Genji " is there not for the purpose of being admired but " , he says again , " for the purpose of nurturing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . To be blunt Edmund Seidensticker 's new translation of Genji breaks a myth : it is incomparably sharper , more poetic in the right way , more lyrical , and more successful than the translation we have all been used to by Arthur Waley . I have never greatly admired Waley 's famous translations . When he translated Chinese poems he made all Chinese poets sound alike . When he translated Genji , he cut , squashed , invented and expurgated and expanded in a cavalier way , and treated us to drenchings of pseudo-romantic reach-me-down English . Here is a very small yet I think sufficient pair of samples : Waley : " At Akashi , as frequently happens in autumn , heavy winds were blowing in the bay . Genji began to find the long evenings very monotonous and depressing . " I World within Walls by Donald Keene ( 1976 ) . // Seidensticker : " At Akashi it was the season when cold winds blow from the sea to make a lonely bed even lonelier . " Arthur Waley earned our gratitude by introducing us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saccharine English . But the bluff has been called ; and a grand masterpiece at last appears in its laconic strength and delightfulness , so that reading Seidensticker 's Genji is now a new experience . Donald Keene 's book caps an anthology of Japanese literature which he made years ago . Many readers will value its short clear chapters for the account they give of the greater haiku poets ? poets beginning with Basho in the seventeenth century , who turned a few-syllabled form of comic verse into poems which contain the world , poems which give profound experiences " in their purest , most evocative essentials " . It was a very strange proceeding , rather as if masterly poets had taken hold of limericks and packed into them all that makes a sonnet . Translations abound , but it is good to see the poets in relation to each other , good to learn of their pronouncements , which are as apt to western as to eastern writing . " Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the men of old , " says Basho , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basho again ? " Learn about pines from the pines ; study bamboos with the bamboos . " Or ? from a lesser poet Hayano Hajin , in the eighteenth century , " A poem should be written suddenly without consideration of before or after , changing and developing with the moment . " Readers will find haiku they may not have met before ? by Issa , for instance , written of a breakfast time near Mount Asama , when he was travelling : At break of dawn The fog from Asama Creeps over my breakfast tray . Or by Basho , greatest of all haiku writers : The whitebait ? At dawn an inch Of whiteness . The most wonderful piece quoted in translation comes , not from a haiku poet , but from Chikamatsu Monzaemon , the Japanese Shakespeare , as he is called , from one of his puppet plays , " The Love Suicides at Sonezaki " . The lovers are walking to their death and the man says Farewell to this world , and to the night farewell . // We who walk the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the frost by the road that leads to the graveyard , Vanishing with each step we take ahead : How sad is this dream of a dream . It was Chikamatsu who miraculously defined art as that " which lies in the slender margin between the real and the unreal " . 3 . WEN I-TO Wen I-to , assassinated in 1946 for opposing the Kuomintang , published only two books of verse , in 1923 Red Candle ( the title of which is used for this selection ) , ' in 1928 Dead Water , named from the celebrated poem about China as a ditch of water green with copper waste and cloudy with bacteria ? out of which something might grow . A few pieces in translation ( the best , revised by Wen himself , were in Robert Payne 's Contemporary Chinese Poetry , 1947 ) suggested that he must be one of the great poets of our century . So he seems in this larger selection . Of course in another language he can not be listened to . But he can be seen . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet . He writes of pampering his life because he loved its colours . But if he saw colour with the lucidity of Tennyson or Leconte de Lisle or Rimbaud or Louis MacNeice , colour also revealed to him the human condition ? specifically of his own China . " Quiet night , I can not , I can not accept your bribery . " Distress , anger , love purified his colours ; colour and image are a way into his poems , in translation at any rate . " I first played a flock of white doves in a frosty wood , their coral claws treading on a heap of yellow leaves . " Or ( the ice melting ) " white teeth midway in the stream arc lightly rinsed by ripples " . Or snow has buried houses , but " could n't bury the thread of blue smoke " rising from them . Or Wen is a rotten fruit asleep " on the cold stinging green moss " . Or " Life is the meeting of floating duckweed " , or " When the mountain spring has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can it flow ? " Two translations in particular suggest a great formal artistry in Wen . These are from poems about the death of his child ( when he was in America ) . In one of them each of seven stanzas begins and ends : " Forget her like a forgotten flower . " The other one starts off :
