OPEC Dilemma How to handle the glut <P> Twice in the past ten years the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has sent the price of crude oil spurting , bringing riches to the 13-nation oil cartel and economic agony to just about everyone else . But now the combined effects of conservation and worldwide recession have left oil prices skidding , created a global supply glut where once there was scarcity , and shaken the foundations of the formidable cartel . <P> This weekend , when the ministers of the world 's least loved cartel gather in Vienna , the session is apt to be the stormiest ever . The members are poorer than they once were ; oil exports lifted the current account balance of the OPEC nations to a record $109 billion surplus in 1980 , but this year there will be a deficit , estimated at more than $15 billion . The delegates must face the painful fact that they can no longer control both prices and production at high levels , a nettlesome problem because OPEC members have shown little inclination to live with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last March when Saudi Arabia , the group 's biggest producer at 7.5 million bbl. per day of output , forced through what amounted to a 9.6% production cut . Its purpose : to take up slack in the market and prevent petroleum prices from slipping below the cartel 's official $34-per-bbl. bench-mark level . Once they had agreed to the cuts , Iran , Libya , Venezuela and several other cash-squeezed member states began pumping crude at levels above their ceilings ( see chart ) , as well as discounting the price to their customers . As a result , by last week prices on the unregulated spot market had dropped to $29 per bbl. , down from an alltime high of $42 two years ago . Meanwhile , a worldwide glut of oil has developed , swelling to more than 4 million bbl. per day in excess of demand . <P> In an effort to halt the slide , Saudi officials have been pressuring OPEC 's discounters to stop their cheating on prices and production . If necessary , the Saudis recently began hinting , Riyadh would start price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exporters from the market . <P> In fact , the cautious and conservative-minded Saudis are much more likely to use a carrot at Vienna than a stick . The betting is that they will favor holding the official price at $34 per bbl . As for production , the Saudis might decide to raise the spring quotas by about 10% , which would legitimize the cheating with a return to pre-March levels , while perhaps trimming their own output to keep the glut from growing worse . At the same time , the Riyadh government would stand ready to provide low-interest loans to help tide over financially squeezed cartel members until the world economy starts to recover and , the Saudis hope , oil sales begin to improve . <P> To the Saudis , a compromise approach is much more appealing than a high-risk strategy of dramatically slashing prices in order to drive other members into line . Reason : though economists generally agree that a slow and moderate decline in prices to , perhaps , $25 to $28 per bbl. would on balance be a long-term tonic for the wavering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought on by runaway discounting could prove perilous for oil exporters and importers alike .
