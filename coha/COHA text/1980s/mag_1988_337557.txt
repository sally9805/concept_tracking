The showdown had all the breathless drama that readers of the tabloid New York $ Post ( circ. 480,000 ) have come to expect . Australian-born Media Baron Rupert Murdoch , selling the Post to comply with a federal ban on owning a newspaper and broadcast station in the same city , had threatened to shut down the paper unless unions agreed to $24 million in cost reductions . Murdoch said he needed the cuts to complete the sale of the paper to New York Real Estate Developer Peter Kalikow for $37 million . <P> But as a 2 p.m . Friday deadline neared , the Post and its unions remained $3 million apart . Rather than stop the presses , Murdoch agreed to stop the clock . At 1:50 a.m . Saturday , the unions consented to $21 million in concessions over the next three years and Murdoch agreed to make a $3 million contribution to restore some pay cuts for remaining employees . The agreement saved the Post from printing its final edition after 187 years .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
