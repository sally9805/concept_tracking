" Outfielders , and first basemen , too , they don ' t have to think , " says the latest Dodger third baseman , Enos Cabell . " But the other infielders have to think. " // Once asked what went through his mind while hunched over at the " hot corner , " Guerrero admitted he was thinking : " Please don ' t hit the ball to me . " And what was his second thought ? " Please don ' t hit it to Sax , " a reference to Steve Sax , the second baseman who for a long time had problems making the short throw to first base. // Guerrero has been carrying the Dodgers since June 1 , when he was liberated from third base to roam left field and dream about mayhem on the pitchers of the world . He was 3 for 4 Monday night and was batting . 321 going into last night ' s game , when he was used at first base for the eighth time this year after starting 44 games at third base , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was second in the league with 30 home runs , after batting only . 268 with 4 homers in April and May while assigned to third base. // The switch to left field was one of the wisest personnel moves in the managing career of Tom Lasorda , but , then again , it had been Lasorda who put Guerrero on third base after the Dodgers excessed Ron Cey after the 1982 season . <> <> Guerrero - in Spanish it means // " warrior " - is not a player you would want to waste . Magnificently proportioned , with thick shoulders , thin waist and tapered legs , he was a . 303 hitter coming into this season , just reaching his prime at the age of 29 . But he was reaching his prime as a third baseman , and his mind was cluttered. // " I feel more comfortable in the outfield , " Guerrero explains for the 100th time . " I don ' t have to think about as much . If you play all your life at one position , that ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ' s another. " // Last year Guerrero had signed a five-year contract , and he reported " just a little late , just a little overweight , " Lasorda recalled . Playing third base , he had trouble getting started , but Lasorda bailed him out in early July , and Guerrero raised his batting average to . 303. // " Last year Pete came to me and asked if he could go back to the outfield . " Lasorda recalls . " He wasn ' t hitting , and he was looking for reasons why he wasn ' t hitting , so he figured it was his fielding. " // Lasorda tried again this year , but made the change earlier. // Guerrero likes to stand in the field and wiggle his hips and flex his arms , working on his hitting stroke . It ' s hard to do that when somebody may slash a screaming grounder at his teeth . On June 1 , Lasorda , who speaks Spanish as comfortably as Guerrero speaks English , assured him bilingually that he could now focus on terrorizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June. // " Coming from the Dominican Republic , " Lasorda says with a deadpan , " Pete didn ' t know the old rhyme about ' Thirty days hath September . ' We didn ' t tell him June has only 30 days . He thinks today is June 87th or whatever . " The Dodgers used Dave Anderson and Bob Bailor at third base until July 10 , when they acquired the tall , slender Cabell , who had spent much of his career trading barbs with Lasorda as a Houston and San Francisco third baseman. // " Second basemen and shortstops , they ' re not expected to hit with power , " Cabell explains , " because they can turn the double play . Third basemen and catchers have a lot to think about , too . Now Pete doesn ' t have to think about that stuff. " // There are still perils to playing the outfield , and Guerrero experienced one on June 10 when he pulled a back muscle while chasing a hit by Johnny Ray in Pittsburgh . Coming into the dugout for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have one more swing in me. " // The one swing was a savage lunge at a pitch by Lee Tunnell , and a home run that went " nine miles , " according to Cabell . The only thing wrong was that Guerrero aggravated the muscle pull and nearly crumpled at home plate . He was barely able to hobble to first base , where Manny Mota , the coach , told him to take his time. // Some of Guerrero ' s home-run trots have been timed on a sundial , but this one was nearly timed on a calendar . It was getting close to July 11 by the time he hobbled home with the run that put the Dodgers ahead to stay . But he missed seven games - four of them in Chicago with the wind blowing out - and the All-Star Game , although he made a point of attending in uniform . Guerrero also missed the first game back after the two-day strike by the players . He had gone home to San Pedro de Macoris for a visit , but when the air-conditioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother , he took refuge in a motel near the airport . He missed his wake-up call , and was absent as the Dodgers lost the first game back . The next night he arrived , and hit a three-run home in the bottom of the first , and he has been slugging ever since , as if it were still June. // " I ' ve seen Murphy and Schmitty and Mays and Aaron and Frank Robinson carry ball clubs , " Lasorda says . " That ' s what Pete means for us now. " // Cabell , the former Dodger adversary , says : " I didn ' t think Pete was that good a clutch hitter , but since I ' ve been here , if you need a three-run dinger , he ' ll hit a three-run dinger . If he isn ' t the most valuable player in the league , it ' s fixed. " // Asked how good a player he has become , Guerrero says reasonably , " I can ' t answer that question . It ' s up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " When a Dodger reporter says he thinks Guerrero has arrived at the Dale Murphy-Mike Schmidt-Andre Dawson level , Guerrero smiles softly and says , " If you think so , I agree with you . Sometimes , I ' ll go along with everybody. " //
