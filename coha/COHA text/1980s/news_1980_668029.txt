In the most expensive election in Boston ' s history , Mayor Kevin H. White spent $9.60 per vote to win re-election , according to campaign records filed yesterday with the city clerk . White , the only one of six mayoral candidates to file his finance reports by yesterday ' s deadline , reported having raised a record $1,449,126 for last year ' s preliminary and final election campaign . The mayor ' s report said he spent $1.23 million of that , including $23,000 for last Sunday ' s inaugural ball , and still had $219,000 left . Estimates of the money raised by White ' s principal challengers showed the mayor ' s cost per vote was only slightly higher than the average for the entire field , which was about $9.35 per vote . A total of about $2.4 million was spent by all the candidates . By contrast , White spent $5.90 a vote to win re-election in 1975 , and his principal opponent , state Sen. Joseph Timilty spent $2.89 a vote . Timilty ' s campaign finance chairman gave estimates last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year ' s election . None of White ' s opponents filed their reports of fund-raising and expenditures yesterday , although David Finnegan and Timilty ' s finance chairman , Paul Goodrich , said they would file soon . Goodrich estimated Timilty had spent about $850,000 on his campaign , which would show a deficit of $75,000 to $100,000 . The escalating cost of running a mayoral campaign traditionally has given a significant advantage to the incumbent , who is able to attract contributions not only from the thousands of city workers indebted to him for their jobs but also from private businesses to whom the mayor channels city business . Timilty , trying to eliminate this advantage , proposed unsuccessfully in the last election that all candidates voluntarily operate within a $250,000- ceiling on expenditures . " It ' s the worst part of the business , without a doubt , " Finnegan said of fund-raising . " I think it inhibits the ability of people to be involved in the process at all . It really narrows the field . " While White faced Timilty in the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by four other candidates as well : state Rep. Mel King ( D-South End ) ; Finnegan , who at the time was president of the School Committee ; Luis Castro of the Socialist Workers Party ; and Laurence Sherman of the US Labor Party . Finnegan said he had raised about $330,000 and had a deficit of about $70,000 . King , who raised about $30,000 , could not be contacted last night . According to the Boston Election Department , White received 128,320 votes in the 1979 preliminary and final elections , while Timilty won 97,295 votes in the two contests . In the preliminary , Finnegan had 17,306 and King 17,490 , while Sherman and Castro each had less than 300 votes , a department official said . Most of White ' s campaign expenses were related to purchases of television advertising , and , in the report filed yesterday , the largest cost , more than $40,000 , was for consulting fees paid to David Sawyer , the mayor ' s advertising chief . For his inaugural ball , the largest expense was $5548 worth of champagne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom had worked on his campaign or supported his re-election . Among the current members of the City Council , only Frederick Langone did not meet the filing deadline , but two members of the School Committee did not file : Jean Sullivan McKeigue and Gerald O ' Leary . Under the state campaign financing law , the city clerk must notify delinquent candidates of their failure to file reports , and if the candidates still do not file , the attorney general is to be notified . Ultimately , a delinquent candidate could be punished by a sentence of up to a year in jail and a fine of $1000 . B08049844
