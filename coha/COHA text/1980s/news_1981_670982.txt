That brought the total number of Haitians at the camp to 1 , 247 . Officials say the camp ' s capacity should be 525. // // Suit to Fight Deportation // On Monday morning , Federal District Judge Alcee Hastings is scheduled to hear more testimony in a suit filed to stop the Immigration and Naturalization Service from carrying out its solution to the problem , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after mass , closed-door hearings from which even lawyers have been barred. // The Federal Government contends that Haitians , unlike the Cuban refugees that came here by boat last year , are not fleeing political oppression , and therefore as a group are not entitled to political asylum. // The suit , filed by attorneys for the Haitian Refugee Center Inc. and the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of 85 Haitians who were subjected to the hearings June 1-5 , and those still facing them , contends that the agency ' s procedures are unconstitutional. // Assistant United States Attorney Richard A. Marshall told the court at the hearings that the Haitians had waived their rights to an attorney knowingly and had said they did not want to appeal. // Last week , however , expert witnesses testified that tapes and transcripts of the hearings revealed bad translations , inaccuracies and omissions in the procedings . <> <> Problems in Translation // Jocelyne Legrand , a language instructor at Miami Dade Community College and the University of Miami , testified that very little of the upper class Creole vocabulary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of whom are from poor backgrounds. // She said that words such as " expired visas , " " hearings , " " citizen , " and " political asylum " were either translated into French , which most Haitians do not understand , or not translated at all . The word " asylum " is understood by many of the Haitians to mean a mental hospital , she said. // When the immigration judge asked the refugees if they wanted to appeal his deportation ruling to a " higher court , " she said , the translator asked the Haitians if they wanted to go to a " larger courtroom . " <> <> Haitian Changed Response // Lucien Louis , a 21-year-old refugee , testified that the immigration judge had asked him if he was afraid to go home .

Tuesday , two buses filled with refugees from the camp arrived at a parking lot near an immigration agency office in the Liberty City section of Miami , but many relatives and sponsors who were to meet the Haitians there did not arrive . About 30 of those left wandering around spent the night at the Haitian Refugee Center , evoking charges that the Haitians were " dumped , " a characterization that Verne Jervis , an immigration agency spokesman , called " absolutely inaccurate.
