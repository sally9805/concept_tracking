txt Allied Corp . may reduce its stake in Martin Marietta Corp . to 20% from 33% within 12 months as a means of reducing its debt , said Edward L. Hennessy Jr. , Allied 's chairman and chief executive officer . Mr. Hennessy made the remark to a group of securities brokers and analysts in Toronto . " Right now , we have no plans to sell our Martin Marietta shares , " he said . " That 's not to say we wo n't do some ( selling ) in the future . We might take the investment down to 20% . " Later , he said such a reduction might take place " within the next 12 months . " Sources at Allied and Martin Marietta said Mr. Hennessy 's statement should n't be intrepreted to mean relations between the companies have cooled . Some investors speculated that Allied might have been irritated last week when Martin Marietta sold its International Laser Systems unit to Litton Industries Inc. for $46 million . Allied had said it wanted to buy the laser unit . " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Litton sale would n't be valid , " an Allied spokeswoman said . " One does n't have anything to do with the other . " Standstill Pact Allied still is bound by a 10-year standstill agreement with Martin Marietta , reached last September as part of a truce that ended the takeover battle between Martin Marietta and Bendix Corp . When the high-stakes battle was over , Allied had bought Bendix , the aggressor , and had acquired 39% of Martin Marietta , the unwilling target that fought back . Allied 's 39% stake since has shrunk because the aerospace and defense contractor issued new shares to raise capital and reduce the debt it took on in the fight . Under the standstill agreement , Allied , whose products include chemicals and electronic and scientific equipment , must give Martin Marietta first chance to buy the shares it owns . If Martin Marietta declines , Allied can sell its block only piecemeal on the open market . At the time of the agreement , Mr. Hennessy said Allied would " do anything we can to help them ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Allied , which paid a total of $1.9 billion for Bendix and its stake in Martin Marietta , also would like to ease pressures on its own balance sheet . Debt Totaling $2 Billion Mr. Hennessy said in Toronto that Allied has n't any plans for an equity issue to reduce its debt , which totals about $2 billion . ( Allied recently sold for $129 million the 7.2% stake in RCA Corp . that it inherited by acquiring Bendix . ) Elaborating on Mr. Hennessy 's comments , the company 's spokeswoman said , " It 's true that we expect to reduce our debt within a year . One way would be to divest some assets . " She said Mr. Hennessy 's mention of 20% as the level to which Allied 's Martin Marietta stake might drop was " just an example . " That level is the lowest percentage at which Allied still could report its equity in Martin Marietta for earnings purposes , she said .                    @
