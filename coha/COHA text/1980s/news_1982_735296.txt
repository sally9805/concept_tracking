txt American Motors Corp . is about to make the supreme sacnfice . To save its partnership with the French auto maker Renault , the littlest American auto company is going to embark on a commercial kamikaze mission . The objective : To obliterate the stodgy AMC image and clear a path for Renault to try to grab a bigger share of the U.S. auto market . If the partnership is going to have any chance of making a dent in the market , both Renault and AMC agree that AMC and all that it stands for will have to virtually disappear from the U.S. automotive scene . " We 're going through almost an automotive revolution . You 've got to erase certain images , " says Pierre Gazarian , executive vice president of Renault U.S.A. The partnership was n't supposed to work like that . When AMC and Renault announced their first joint marketing agreement three years ago , the aim was to bolster AMC by giving it small , fuel-efficient Renault products to sell alongside its own cars and utility vehicles . In exchange . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lucrative U.S. market and would also sell AMC 's Jeeps outside the U.S. AMC 's Niche But that plan did n't take into account AMC 's image and clientele . Over the years , AMC had worked itself into one of the worst niches in the car market , making strangelooking cars that sold to older , lower-income buyers . AMC 's customers were n't willing to spend much , did n't buy often and certainly were n't interested in acquiring zippy little imports . As AMC 's condition worsened , Renault began helping to finance product development for its ailing partner and wound up owning nearly 50% of the company . Now Renault is getting ready for a new attack on the U.S. market with a line of small , front-wheel-drive cars . The Renault Fuego , a spiffy sports sedan , is being introduced this month . And this fall the first Renault Alliance sedans are due to roll off AMC 's assembly line in Kenosha , Wis . Other Renault models will follow , and - all will be sold through AMC 's more than 1,000 dealers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at AMC is Joseph Cappy , the company 's new vice president of marketing . Lured from Ford Motor Co. earlier this year , Mr. Cappy is intent on shedding AMC 's old image as fast as possible , leaving the company to play to what hesees as its two strengths  --  Renault and Jeep . AMC has a reputation for making cars " for Joe Lunchbucket , schoolteachers and mailmen , " he says . " Renault does n't have an image in this country . It 's a blank sheet of paper . " To keep from soiling that blank sheet of paper , Mr. Cappy is recommending that the AMC logo be dropped from the Alliance sedans due to be introduced next fall , despite the fact that they 're being built by AMC workers in an AMC plant . ( AMC chairman W. Paul Tippett says the AMC logo will be on the car . ) And that 's just one of the ways The Renault Fuego is being introduced this month , and competitors are impressed by the car . " It 's going to poke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designer says . in which AMC is trying to make itself scarce . Over the next two years , Mr. Cappy says , the big AMC signs most likely will disappear from in front of dealerships , to be replaced by signs prominently sporting the Renault and Jeep logos . And he predicts that AMC cars such as the Concord and Spirit will be either phased out or renamed under the Jeep brand . Even now AMC 's advertising is beginning to play up Renault while downgrading AMC . Advertising for the Fuego , for example , does n't mention that the cars must be bought at AMC dealers , and the AMC name and logo are conspicuously smaller than the Renault emblem . Renault itself is starting a separate ad compaign that touts its racing prowess and ability to produce fuel-efficient , front-wheel-drive cars but barely mentions AMC . It 's all part of a big effort to capture the customers whom Mr. Cappy calls " boomers . " Born in the baby boom and raised on a diet of television advertising , theboomers do n't share the traditional values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-educated , affluent boomers enter the prime car-buying ages between 24 and 40 , they 're shunning AMC products and flocking to imported cars , particularly Japanese models . The way Mr. Cappy figures it , any car maker who does n't attract some boomers is as good as dead . But not everyone is convinced that AMC and Renault can pull off the metamorphosis . For one thing , Renault 's image in the U.S. might n't be as clean as Mr. Cappy would like it . Auto industry insiders have n't forgotten the blunder that Renault made 20 years ago when it tried to sell its little Dauphine in the U.S. The car 's strange appearance compounded a series of problems with distribution and reliability and left automobile dealers with a sour taste for Renault . There 's also the question of Renault 's ability to design new cars for the U.S. market . Since the Dauphine debacle , French cars have acquired a reputation as being somehow too " odd " for American tastes . " French cars are different , " says J. D. Power , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The angles and shapes do n't seem to fit in with conventional lines that are popular at the time , and their interiors are different . " But the biggest problem of all may turn out to be the thing that Renault most wanted out of its partnership with AMC  --  its dealers . With more than 1,000 dealers spread across the U.S. , Renault is getting a bargain in sheer numbers . " To convince over a thousand people to put capital up to sponsor Renault products would probably have been impossible if Renault tried it alone , " says an auto analyst . Selling Dealers on Selling Renaults But the outlets are next to worthless if the dealers wo n't try to sell the products , he adds . " It 's one thing to get the outlets , and quite another to convince dealers to push the car . They 've got to be convinced to stick the Renaults out front , carry a spare-parts inventory and learn to service the cars . " Even Mr. Cappy is worried about the dealership problem . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident about actually selling the cars , " he says . Again , the problem is AMC 's old clientele . AMC dealers , says Mr. Cappy , are used to dickering with customers over price and have paid little attention to product attributes . As the clientele shifts toward younger , more knowledgeable buyers , the dealers are going to find themselves being asked questions about performance and engineering that they 've never been asked before . How well they can respond is going to help determine how well Renault products sell , says Mr. Cappy . Another problem Mr. Cappy foresees is that dealers are n't prepared to handle the additional volume AMC hopes to generate . In some cases Mr. Cappy expects Renault sales to triple or quadruple a dealer 's annual volume , and so the dealer has got to begin now to line up the extra financing from banks to support the larger inventories that will be necessary . Those dealers whose financial condition does n't permit that kind of expansion are likely to fall by the wayside , Mr. Cappy says . But if things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be plenty more dealers waiting to take their place . Mr. Cappy says he 's convinced that AMC can handle the marketing problems and that Renault can build cars to suit U.S. tastes . He points to the Fuego as an example . The car is priced at about ** for the standard model and about ** for the turbocharged version , and Mr. Cappy does n't expect any problem in meeting the company 's goal of selling 10,000 or so Fuegos by the end of this year . Competitors are impressed by the car 's design and engineering . " It will definitely move the needle in Renault 's direction , " says a designer for another car maker . " It 's going to poke their nose into the right market . "
