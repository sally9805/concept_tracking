American taxes force U.S. businessmen back from abroad <P> The Cummins diesel engine distributor in Hong Kong , J.W. Streeter , commutes 5,636 miles every month to work from his home in Honolulu . He does so gladly . Before he moved from Hong Kong back to the U.S. in 1979 , Streeter had been spending $65,000 a year on rent and education for his four children . Although these costs resulted directly from his work in Hong Kong , the Internal Revenue Service did not give him full tax credit on them . Says he : " I 'm saving at least $1,500 a month by living in Honolulu , and that is more than enough to pay for the plane ride every few weeks . " <P> From Tokyo to London , anguished U.S. businessmen are complaining about the unbearable financial burdens of what were once considered cushy overseas assignments . Long battered by the declining value of the dollar , many of the 1.5 million Americans working abroad now claim that the IRS has made life even harder by penalizing them unfairly . Companies doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it too expensive to keep American employees abroad and are replacing them with foreigners . <P> The cause of the complaints is changes in the U.S. tax code . Beginning in 1976 , the Government began pushing up the tax brackets of Americans working outside the U.S. It also tightened the rules on exemptions for the benefits many receive while employed overseas . The equivalent of an apartment renting for $700 a month in Chicago , for example , might run $2,000 or more in Saudi Arabia . Private English-language schools there can cost as much as $5,000 a year for each child . The tax changes that finally went into effect in 1978 made it almost prohibitively expensive for independent American business men to work abroad and hiked the tab for companies that pick up their employees ' expenses . Firms usually pay the extra tax , but the proceeds then become taxable income for the employees . ITT estimates that a $40,000-a-year executive can wind up paying taxes on $95,000 of gross income . The extra tax bill : about $33,000 . <P> These additional expenses have forced more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overseas posts . Within the past four years , RCA , Boeing , AT &T; and General Electric have substantially reduced the number of Yankees that they employ abroad . After Dow Chemical 's Pacific subsidiary discovered that U.S. tax laws alone cost the company $17,000 a worker , it cut back its U.S. staff in Hong Kong from 36 to 24 . At the same time , it increased its total employment by 50% by hiring less costly employees from other countries . <P> Trade experts maintain that replacing Americans with workers from other nations can lead to a decline in U.S. exports . Reason : the difficulty of adapting to American-style operations . Says Gibson Durfee , president of Westinghouse Nuclear Belgium : " Obviously , if you whittle away American representation abroad , you carve away at America 's competitive position . " Adds Karl Gelbard , who is leaving Merrill Lynch 's Hong Kong office partly because of the tax burden : " I need Americans to sell American stocks . But I can not afford to bring them in from the U.S. "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
