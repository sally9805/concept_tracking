For as long as she can remember , Gwen Linde wanted to be a pilot . At Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield , Calif. , Linde , 29 , is commander of a C-141 transport plane , a mammoth , 75-ton , four-engine workhorse that carries everything from weapons , paratroopers and medical supplies to Bob Hope and his entourage . Leading a crew of six , Linde routinely carries out five-day missions to bases in Hawaii , Guam and the Azores . Her dream , however , is to fly the fighter jets that she once trained others to operate . But since those elite birds are designated for combat , women have been barred from flying them on Air Force missions . " It was always frustrating knowing that I could n't fly in a fighter plane , " says Linde . " But you ca n't keep knocking your head against a wall . " <P> Each of the U.S. armed forces has regulations , based on congressional legislation , designed to prevent female soldiers from being killed in action or captured as prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat support " roles . But in an era when combat no longer occurs on clear-cut front lines , supported by a rear echelon , these rules , established after World War II , have created some peculiar quandaries . While Linde and her female colleagues are not permitted to fly fighter aircraft , Air Force women regularly pilot KC-135 tankers that refuel the fighters and make an even more tempting target for enemy missiles . Though women are banned from Navy destroyers , they may support and supply vessels that steam in dangerous waters . Women piloted tankers in the 1986 air strike on Libya and flew cargo planes in the invasion of Grenada . Says Lawrence Korb , a former Pentagon official and Brookings Institution military expert : " It 's kidding oneself to think these are n't combat roles . " <P> Last week the Pentagon took a step toward making better sense of a woman 's place in the military . Based on the recommendations of a special task force , Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci ordered a series of reforms that will open up 4,000 Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to women . While not abandoning the exclusionary rule , " we will now go as far as we can within these legislative constraints , " explains David Armor , Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management and Personnel , who headed the task force . " We 're developing a clear rationale for opening all jobs , except those which are strictly combat . " The highlights of the reforms : <P>  --  The Air Force will allow women aboard high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft such as the SR-71 Blackbird , the TR-1 and the U-2 . <P>  --  The Marine Corps will have women serve as security guards at U.S. embassies . <P>  --  The Navy will permit female personnel on the EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft . The Pentagon also endorsed the plan announced by Navy Secretary James Webb last month to assign women to ammunition ships , oilers and other vessels in the Navy 's " combat logistics force . " This policy alone is expected to create up to 9,000 new jobs for female sailors . <P>  --  The Army should consider opening certain brigade positions , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks as front-line battalions .
