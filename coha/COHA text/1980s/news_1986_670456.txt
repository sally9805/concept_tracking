While lobbing these political grenades in the final days before the election Nov. 4 , they will also be hunkering in the trenches to escape potentially lethal return fire , especially in the three dozen or so races that are very close . All 435 House seats will be filled this year. // Democrats say the Republicans " market-tested " some of the negative tactics in 1984 ; Republicans say the strategies the Democrats plan to resort to are a good deal older . <> <> ' Expect More of the Same ' // " In the final days of the 1984 campaign , many House Democrats , even with ' safe ' seats , were hit with vicious and often illegal attacks by their Republican opponents and/or the National Republican Congressional Committee , " said a letter sent to House Democratic candidates last week by Representative Tony Coelho , a Californian who is chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee . " We should expect more of the same . In fact , it has already started. " // He said Democratic candidates should " inoculate " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and should be prepared to counterpunch. // But Joseph R. Gaylord , executive director of the Republican committee , said the Democrats were preparing some last-minute negative campaigning of their own . " They ' re going to cry misery , gloom and doom , " he said , " and then in places where they ' re really in deep trouble they ' re going to raise the Social Security issue and scare the old people. " // Both parties have already begun to fulfill each other ' s worst expectations. // Last week , for example , a mailing received by voters in Kalamazoo , Mich. , advised that Jews outside the district were contributing to a local Congressional campaign . " In 1984 , " the mailing said , " Howard Wolpe and six of his colleagues raised money by sending a letter to members of their religion outside the district . In 1986 , California actor Ed Asner and Howard Wolpe are raising money by sending a letter to one-half million members of their religion outside our district. " // Mr. Wolpe , a Democratic incumbent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Jackie McGregor , a Republican and a Roman Catholic , whose campaign prepared the mailing . The National Republican Congressional Committee financed the mailing but did not approve its contents . " We did not want to bring religion into this race , but we thought that people should know where the money is coming from , " said William Fraizer , Miss McGregor ' s campaign manager. // In Louisiana , Richard Baker , a Republican who won election to the House last month after gaining a majority in an open primary , cried foul when his Democratic opponent , Thomas Hudson , circulated a letter from a business lobbyist purportedly attacking Mr. Baker ' s personal integrity. // The letter was disavowed by the lobbyist , Edward J. Steimel , who said : " I feel obligated to state publicly that I did not see and did not approve the letter . " The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , which gave Mr. Hudson ' s campaign $25 , 000 , says it did not approve the letter ' s contents ; even so , Republicans say the Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Spending Expected // Both parties also expect a surge in last-minute campaign spending. // " The whole range of the way they ' re going to dump money in the final week will bear very little semblance to the Federal election laws , " Martin Franks , executive director of the Democratic committee , said of the Republicans. // In response , Mr. Gaylord said the Republicans indeed intended to end the campaign with a barrage of television and radio commercials , but financed well within the law. // The Republicans say Democratic groups are preparing to " vote tombstones " on Election Day . And the Democrats say the Republicans will seek ways to get around an agreement in Federal court to abandon a " ballot integrity " program that Democrats said tried to " harass , intimidate and improperly challenge " black voters. // The agreement concerned a program in which Republicans sent letters to registered voters in areas that voted 75 percent or more for Walter F. Mondale for President in 1984 . If a letter was returned as undeliverable , the Republicans said , they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The program was conducted in Indiana , Louisiana and Missouri . <> <> ' The Scent of Intimidation ' // " There are many ways the Republicans can do it that do not involve direct mail , " Mr. Franks said , adding that in some sections of the country just a threat of official intervention to scrutinize voters had the effect of intimidation . " Anything that has the remotest scent of intimidation can become a mighty powerful odor , " he said. // Mr. Gaylord said Mr. Franks was correct in assuming that the Republicans would not abandon the program. // " We get the young people to vote , and they get the tombstones to vote , " Mr. Gaylord said . " The ballot integrity program is important . There ' s been widespread vote fraud , and to allow that to happen again would be to abandon our responsibility. " // He also agreed with Mr. Franks when he said there were other devices besides mailings that could be used to assure ballot integrity . But he declined to say exactly what the Republicans had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country to make sure that votes are only counted once , " Mr. Gaylord added. // One target of the mail program was the Eighth District of Indiana , where Republicans say voter fraud accounted for the 1984 victory of Representative Frank McCloskey , a Democrat , over Richard McIntyre , a Republican . Mr. McCloskey initially led by 72 votes out of 233 , 000 , but after ballots were rechecked in one Democratic county , two precincts turned out to have been counted twice . This gave Mr. McIntyre a 34-vote lead . The Democratic-controlled House later agreed with a bipartisan committee that , divided along party lines , declared Mr. McCloskey the winner by four votes . <> <> The Social Security Issue // Mr. Gaylord said he was certain the Democrats would revive the Social Security issue in close races and needlessly frighten older voters with suggestions about reduced benefits. // The Democratic committee has published and circulated a bumper sticker : " Save Social Security Again - Vote Democratic . " And Mark Johnson , a press aide , acknowledged that the Democrats planned to focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in all 435 districts , " Mr. Johnson said . " Why reinvent the wheel when you ' ve got a winner ? The Republicans tried to cut Social Security again last year. " // In fact , the Senate Republicans voted , not to cut Social Security benefits , but to delay a cost-of-living increase . Only 15 House Republicans voted for the plan , which was defeated. // For their part , Republicans plan to use much of their remaining funds to brand Democrats as supporters of tax increases . " They ' re the party of taxes , and they will hear it all the way to Election Day , " Mr. Gaylord said . <> <> Fears of a Direct-Mail Drive // The Democrats fear a last-minute mailing drive , and here , too , their fears are probably well placed . On the Saturday before Election Day 1984 , voters in San Jose , Calif. , received a mailing saying : " Every Year , 50 , 000 Kids Disappear and are Never Heard from Again . . . One Politician Couldn ' t Care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Democrat , had " fought hard to kill " the Missing Children ' s Act , which it called " the single most important piece of legislation affecting the security and safety of our children. " // In fact , Mr. Edwards , chairman of the constitutional rights subcommittee of the House Judiciary committee , organized the hearings on the bill and was its manager on the House floor . His efforts won praise from President Reagan , who wrote Mr. Edwards Oct. 14 , 1982 , " This legislation would not have been enacted without your untiring efforts. " // The mailing bore the official imprint of the Republican committee and Bob Herriott , the Republican who unsuccessfully challenged Mr. Edwards in the 1984 election . Mr. Edwards considered filing a libel suit , until he received a letter from Representative Guy Vander Jagt , then ( and now ) chairman of the Republican committee , saying he had no knowledge of the offending mailing. // " I am genuinely sorry that you were attacked in a mailing funded by the N.R.C.C. , " Mr. Vander Jagt wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I apologize. " // Mr. Gaylord said last week that the mailing had been prepared by the Herriot campaign , but that " both the campaign and field director were adamant that everything in the literature was true . " Republican officials said Mr. Edwards had to be pressured into supporting the bill. // Mr. Franks of the Democratic committee said he considered the mailing " market testing " for the 1986 campaign . <> <> Warning to Democrats // Mr. Gaylord , asked if the Republicans would send out negative mailings in the campaign ' s final days , replied : " I hope so . They will expose the Democratic members for what they are. " // The Coelho letter sent last week to Democratic candidates warned : " The Republicans may hit us unfairly on the drug issue , AIDS , contra aid and defense . They may contend that we are soft on drug pushers , have dragged our feet on the drug issue , have our priorities out of line by supporting some big-spending program at the expense of drug enforcement and may be unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are endangering the health of school kids by not isolating AIDS victims . They may say we are pro-Soviet by not supporting another blank check for the Pentagon . They may say we are pro-Communist for voting against contra aid. " // Mr. Gaylord , asked to respond , said the Democrats ' fears were realistic . " There may be attacks in all of those areas , " he said. //
