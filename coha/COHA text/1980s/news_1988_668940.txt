The moment shone like a lantern on a long , dark trail . The Bulls ' Michael Jordan , playing for a National Basketball Association all-star squad against the U.S. Olympic team , levitated to the right of the basket , got entangled in a thicket of bodies and lofted a 5-foot jumper as he descended . With that , David Robinson , the Great Olympic Hope , rose and authoritatively knocked the ball out of bounds . That sequence Sunday was a reminder of what Robinson once was , of his glory days at the U.S. Naval Academy , when he was college basketball ' s player of the year . But that was more than a year ago , and in the time that passed as he started fulfilling his military commitments , his once-wondrous talents atrophied from disuse . He once was expected to lead the U.S. team in Seoul , but now there is a very real question if he will even be a starter . He has-his one moment against Jordan aside-looked lost and confused in his first three exhibition games and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday . In the game ' s first half , he sat down after four minutes with two fouls and did not return until only 1 : 36 remained in it . In the second half , he played an animated 15 minutes and finished with 13 points but only four rebounds . The whole of his performance was hardly memorable , and during the game he was regularly a target of his coach ' s ire . " David , grab the ball , " John Thompson yelled at him at one point . " David , get over there . Cut the line off , " he raged after Jordan went by Robinson for a reverse layup . " It ' s a matter of getting comfortable on the court and being comfortable with what he expects of you , " Robinson said Sunday . " I ' m confused . I expected to come along faster , " he had said more pointedly Friday night after his team had defeated another NBA all-star squad . " I ' m trying to get my level of concentration to where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustment for me . " That comes from a combination of a lot of things , but I try not to get too disappointed . I ' ll make a mistake , then spend a couple of minutes thinking about it . With our defense , there ' s no time to stop and think . You have to play by instinct , and I need to get it in my head . " I ' m aware that people expect a lot of me . In fact , even my teammates expect a lot out of me . I get the same scrutiny from our team . I ' m trying not to let it get to me , but basically it ' s hard to see what the coaches are driving us to do . " That feeling is now a theme among U.S. team members , and their confusion often shows , even though they have now won three straight from NBA pickup squads . Their point guard is still unknown and must yet be culled from Georgetown ' s Charles Smith , Virginia Tech ' s Vernell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brian Shaw . Pittsburgh ' s Charles Smith is playing the pivot better than Robinson , and the team ' s overall outside shooting has been just this side of miserable . Part of that is attributable , again , to the confusion that reigns , and part to the players ' weariness after a month of two-a-day practices . " There was a time I couldn ' t get my arms up to take a shot , and when I did , I couldn ' t throw it in the ocean , " said Bradley ' s Hersey Hawkins . His shot came back during his team ' s two games in Charlotte , and he now seems a certain starter beside whoever emerges at point guard . Kansas ' Danny Manning and Pitt ' s Smith also seem slated to start , with Central Michigan ' s surprising Dan Majerle leading the hunt at small forward . Those four are certain to travel to Seoul , but Thompson must yet cut four more players from his 16-man squad and begin fashioning the " team " he always talks about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on who they will be , but he does say , " If I would have gotten down before we played here , I would have made mistakes . " You fall in love . You fall out of love . That ' s the difficulty of it , but now I don ' t know how much time I have . I think we need to make some moves right now . I think we need to make a decision now . " When they finally do come , the cuts probably will include Stanford ' s Todd Lichti , incoming Georgetown freshman Alonzo Mourning and , after an unimpressive camp and games , Arizona All-America Sean Elliott . The final cut is more problematical , which , after a weekend with this U.S. team , seems only appropriate . " He doesn ' t look like he knows exactly what ' s happening out there , what they ' re trying to accomplish out there , " Seattle ' s Alton Lister said of Robinson after pushing him around through two games . " They ' re so tentative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to go to war yet , " added Philadelphia ' s Charles Barkley . " Every player in this room , " Pitt ' s Smith said , " has gone through the stage where he felt , ' I ' m going to get cut . ' He ( Thompson ) doesn ' t tell you what he wants . He tells you what he wants as a team , but not individually . That gets confusing . " " That ' s bull , " was Thompson ' s response to that lament , but then even he was forced to conclude : " I see an awful lot of problems . We need an awful lot of work .
