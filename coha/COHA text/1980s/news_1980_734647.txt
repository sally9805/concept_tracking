txt The TV critics , normally a churlish lot , last week had wonderful things to say about Jason Robards ' performance as Franklin Roosevelt in " FDR : The Last Year . " so I tuned in . For the next three hours , I watched the Normandy Invasion and other great crises of World War II being dealt with by Roosevelt , Richard Nixon , and Al Capone . . I remember FDR 's voice from wartime radio speeches and from hearing Republican relatives wickedly mimic it . I remember his face from newsreel and Life Magazine pictures , and the Roosevelt dime . Jason Robards is a fine actor , but he could n't pull it off . Worse , I began to confuse Robards ' Roosevelt with Robards ' other roles , such no his Richard Nixon character in the TV movie of John Ehrlichman 's " Washington : Behind Closed Doors . " There were times when I half expected his FOR to rise from his wheelchair and go wading along the beach in his shoes . His Al Capone character from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the surface once , when I thought he 'd snatch Churchill 's cigar from his mouth , stick it in his own , and snarl to Gen. George C. Marshall to have Bugs Moran rubbed out . As for the Tom Dewey character , he looked like Sid Caesar doing an impersonation of Tom Dewey  --  in a Groucho Marx moustache . Eileen Heckert 's Eleanor Roosevelt was equally ridiculous : she had a pleasant , well-modulated voice . The real Mr. President Robards Eleanor Roosevelt had a voice so shrill as to snap telephone lines . It was no wonder FDR spent so much time on picnics with Lucy Rutherford . Another docu-drama recently had Robert Duvall playing Dwight Eisenhower , which is well enough , except that Duvall subsequently played the mad airborne officer in " Apocalypse Now , " which left one with a feeling of Gen. Eisenhower and Mr. Hyde . With so many tons of film available of the real FDR , Churchill , Eisenhower , etc. , why does the entertainment industry persist in this shoddy manufacture ? I suppose the producers of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very little newsreel footage around of FDR nuzzling Lucy Rutherford in a parked car . But what are we after here , history or sex ? Next question . A reaso.iable argument might also be made that there is very little newsreel footage around of historical characters . But even there Hollywood is often unreasonable . Witness Tony Curtis ' immortal " Yondah lies da castle of my foddah , " or , a film I remember  --  but keep trying to forget  --  starring Errol Flynn and Ronald Reagan as Robert E. Lee and George Custer . Actually , there have been a few actors who so masterfully perfected their roles that no one dared follow them . Charles Laughton as Henry VIII , Claude Rains as Julius Caesar , Glenda Jackson as Elizabeth I , Hal Holbrook as Mark Twain , and George C. Scott as General Patton are just a few who come to mind . The rule ought to be that , once an actor does master such a role , no one else ought to be allowed to perform it . I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ralph Bellamy 's FDR was better than his . As for the role of Richard Nixon , that ought to belong permanently to Dan Ackroyd.
