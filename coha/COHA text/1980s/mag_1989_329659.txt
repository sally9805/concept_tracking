Last year , after fire destroyed their home outside Canton , Miss. , Willie Anderson and seven of her children moved into a rented shack . The place was a horror , with no electricity or running water , rotting walls papered with newsprint , and gaping holes in the tin roof that allowed the rain to pour through . " Once a snake came up under the stove , and we got big rats in there all the time , " recalled Anderson , 47 , a big , strapping woman in a flowered blouse . " I could n't wait to get away . " <P> The family 's ordeal finally ended in August , when a trailer truck carrying a hip-roofed house with yellow shingles pulled up on the site of Anderson 's burned-out home . " This house , " she boasts , " wo n't have no holes like the other one . " <P> Anderson 's new home was donated by a church in nearby Pearl to a nonprofit organization called MadCAAP  --  short for Madison Countians Allied Against Poverty  --  which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation . Financed solely by donations and grants , MadCAAP takes old wood-frame buildings that local communities and private owners no longer need and hauls them to new sites . There volunteers from local churches and schools join with families that have been aided in the past to install wiring , put up paneling and dig septic tanks . Over the past six years MadCAAP has recycled old houses for 70 families in and around Canton ( pop . 11,500 ) , a courthouse-squared town 20 miles north of Jackson . MadCAAP 's aim , according to its unflappable founder and director , Sister Grace Mary McGuire , 57 , is to " try and break the cycle of poverty by helping one family at a time . " <P> Among its recipients is Johnnie Murry , who used to live with her husband and 15 children in a two-room trailer . In 1984 MadCAAP brought a four-bedroom house to Murry 's farm . Now white curtains hang from the windows and stuffed animals , high school banners and framed graduation pictures decorate the wood- paneled walls . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am grateful that I have a place to cook , a table to feed my family at and a place for me to rest later . " <P> For Sister Grace , a conservatively dressed woman with gentle blue eyes and short brown hair , helping the poor has been a lifelong ambition . As a child growing up in New York City , she wanted to aid leprosy sufferers in India . She never made it to Asia , but in 1973 her Philadelphia-based religious order , Missionary Servants of the Most Blessed Trinity , sent her to the Deep South . " I never dreamed that I 'd be working with septic tanks , wiring , let alone moving houses , " she says , " but when people are poor and depressed , you want to do anything you can to uplift them . " <P> Moving a house is a time-consuming affair . The morning that Willie Anderson 's home is delivered begins with workers hoisting the house 's concrete steps onto a pickup truck while Anderson and her children pile broken bricks and stack cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slew of bureaucrats , and Walter Malone , 52 , a professional house mover who has completed 30 jobs for Sister Grace , still has a few final forms to sign and fees to pay . " The biggest difficulty is the paperwork , " he says , pointing to a glove compartment crammed full of documents . " I got so much paperwork on this thing that if anyone stops me , it will take me 15 minutes just to find it . "
