orbits , it was clear that many comets return infrequently , once every few centuries or even longer . At any given moment , he knew , there must be unseen long-period comets that have not lately visited the Sun . And if by chance we see comets with periods of years to centuries , perhaps there are others with periods measured in millennia or more . Halley was prepared to believe in a large population of undiscovered comets with very long periods and high eccentricities . But he did not envision truly immense numbers of comets . When an 18th-century astronomer , Thomas Wright of Durham , drew a rosette of orbits surrounding the Sun , he was not tempted to include more than the few known comets , although he did conclude , " the Comets. . .1 judge to be by far the most numerous Part of the Creation . " The key to the discovery of the comet cloud is the orbits of the comets we see . We must bear in mind that this constitutes only a small sample of all cometary orbits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even be representative of the larger population . But it is our only starting point . An elliptical cometary orbit has a certain size . Its near point to the Sun is called its perihelion and its far point , its aphelion . The line from perihelion to aphelion , running through the Sun , is the major axis of the ellipse , and half the major axis is called the semi-major axis . The semi-major axis of the Earth 's orbit is one astronomical unit ( A.U. ) . Comets with small semimajor axes never leave the planetary part of the solar system , and constitute the kingdom of short-period comets . Such comets are tightly bound to the Sun 's gravity ; it would take a very major influence to perturb their motion significantly . But comets with large semimajor axes spend most of their time far beyond the region of the planets , and less often than once a human lifetime they make a brief foray into the inner solar system . Such long-period comets , much more loosely bound to the Sun , are most easily perturbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period less than 200 years a short-period comet , and one with a period longer than 200 years a long-period comet . There is nothing magic about 200 years ; it is chosen only because this is very roughly ( now a little less than ) the period of modern astronomical study of the comets . So a comet like Halley 's ( by this definition ) is a short-period comet , while one like Comet Kohoutek , which passed by the Earth in 1973 and will not return for another 10 million years , is a long-period comet . ? ? Jan Oort has been for several decades the dean of the distinguished modern school of Dutch astronomers . Among his many contributions to science are the first correct estimate of the distance of the Sun from the center of the Milky Way , the first use of radio astronomy to map the spiral structure of the Milky Way , and the discovery of episodic and titanic explosions at the hub of the Milky Way  --  which may indicate the presence of a massive black hole there . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War II , proposed the existence of a distant cloud of comets , loosely bound to the Sun . Although some aspects of the theory were anticipated by an Estonian-Irish astronomer , Ernst Opik , the full beauty of the idea was first glimpsed and developed by Oort . Oort proposed that a vast cloud of unseen comets surrounds the Sun at immense distances and that all thecomets we see are the deserters and refugees from that distant assemblage . Most of these comets are on fairly circular orbits , with modest eccentricity . They never enter the planetary part of the solar system , and we never see them . But occasionally a cometary nucleus leaves its fellows and plummets into the inner solar system , where it may come close enough to the Sun for us to designate it as a long-period comet ; or else it might make a close pass by one or more of the major planets , and have its orbit progressively altered , so that eventually we describe it as a short-period comet . But what induces this occasional comet , weakly held by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system ? Oort calculated that the Sun , in its motion about the center of the Milky Way galaxy , would sometimes come close enough to other stars to make a kind of gravitational flurry in the comet cloud  --  spilling numbers of them in all directions , including to the vicinity of the Sun . A typical comet in the Oort Cloud is circuiting the Sun at the leisurely pace of about a hundred meters per second , around 220 miles an hour . The change in speed administered by the passing star is only a few tens of centimeters a second , near the top speed your fingers can manage to walk across a tabletop . It represents a very small change in the overall speed of the comet , but it 's enough to send a few of them careening down among the planets . No single gravitational impulse from a passing star causes the comets to flutter about . Rather , the accumulation of a few dozen close stellar passages has produced a jittery population of faster-moving comets , and the latest stellar encounter provides the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun or out into the interstellar medium . It 's the straw that breaks the camel 's back . Even if a star were to plow straight through the comet cloud , the consequences would not be spectacular . Opik likened it to a bullet traversing a rust when television seemed bleaker than ever , he appeared on prime time with his unique talents : the mastery of stand-up comedy , the passion of a parent , the wisdom of Solomon . Just when industry executives were prophesying the death of the half-hour comedy , he revived it with the healing powers of a fairground evangelist . Just when it seemed that television had become a hopeless abyss of tasteless jokes , violence , and sex , he rescued the idea of family entertainment . Just when television seemed most unfunny , he turned a half-hour each week into 30 minutes of laughter . He is Bill Cosby , 48 , and he returned to television just in time . Three years ago , when Cosby got the idea for a weekly comedy series about a black American family living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a message to relay . The so-called experts told him no  --  as in " no way . " It seemed absurd to them that he wanted to star in a show that mirrored reality , that avoided abusive or vulgar language . They could n't picture a family show in which kids learn that parents can be very strict and yet full of love , or that parents can learn from their children . Two networks said it could n't be done ; a third , NBC , gave " The Cosby Show " the go-ahead . That was all Bill Cosby needed . In only its second season , " The Cosby Show " has become America 's highest rated weekly television series . For nearly 60 million people , this charming and insightful half-hour comedy is a Thursday-night ritual , a humorous excursion into the trenches of parenting , a world once described as a " domestic war zone . " And despite what the experts feared , says Cosby , riding a wave of success that 's gone well beyond anyone 's expectations , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have settled into what we 're doing and love it . " Why ? Probably because Cosby 's vision of family life , a bittersweet existence of equal parts chaos and calm , strikes so close to so many homes . On the air , Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable , a wise , affable obstetrician , is married to his beautiful lawyer wife , Clair , and father to their five high-spirited children . Offscreen , Dr. William Henry Cosby , a wise , affable comedian , is married to his beautiful wife , Camille , and father to their five high-spirited children . The similarity is purposeful . " My family life is the behavior I know best , " says Cosby , who maintains that parents all share similar experiences . " For instance , one of the things I found out is that no matter how much money a parent has , you ca n't buy a kid who 's going to do schoolwork .

A multimillionaire long ago , Cosby , in more than 20 years of performing , has amassed a library of work that includes 20 comedy albums , 5 TV series , 10 movies , and a small Fort Knox of Grammy and Emmy awards , among others . Though he did n't need the work , Cosby the philosopher was interested in exploring the behavior of parents toward children . " Regardless of race or social status , parents perceive themselves as people who work hard and have wisdom to hand down to their children , " Cosby says . " And they all see their children as these brain-damaged people who repel wisdom . " What he delivers is a show about a husband and wife who love each other and love their children , people who care about imparting old-fashioned values simply because " they have read yesterday 's newspaper , " as Cosby is fond of saying .

With a trillion or more comets in the Oort Cloud , you might think that comets are closer together there than anywhere else in the solar system  --  perhaps huddling together , far from the Sun , like one of Dor6 's illustraLions of the souls of the dead . But the number of comets is more than balanced by the immensity of the space they occupy , and the typical distance from one comet to another out there is about 20 AUs , roughly the same as the distance from the Earth to the planet Uranus . The greatest concentration of comets in the solar system happens , it seems , to be in the very innermost parts , where by lucky chance we happen to live . The three or four long-period comets that each year are passing through together with all the short-period comets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ density of comets anywhere between here and the nearest star system , Alpha Centauri . The Voyager 2 spacecraft was launched in 1977 on an unusual high-energy trajectory so that it would reach the planet Uranus in 1986 and Neptune in 1989 . If our present spacecraft could get out to the Oort Cloud , it would take us a decade or more to fly from comet to comet . But we can not soon get to the Oort Cloud . The Voyager spacecraft  --  the fastest ever launched by the human species  --  took nine years to go from Earth to Uranus ; it will take them 10,000 years to reach the main comet repository . The comets themselves take a few million years to fall from the solar-system frontiers to the vicinity of the Earth . The Oort Cloud is very far away . Altogether , how much do a trillion comets weigh ? If every one of them is about a kilometer across , then the total mass of all the comets in the outer Oort Cloud is about the same as the present mass of the Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and divided it up into little kilometer-sized chunks , you would have in numbers and sizt ( but not in composition ) some approximation of the current population of the outer Oort Cloud . If , as seems likely , the typical comet is a little bigger , or if you include the inner Oort Cloud , then the total mass of the cloud will be considerably more . A typical comet in the Oort Cloud has existed for billions of years at a temperature only a few degrees above absolute zero . There are no collisions , no heating of the comet , no outgassing . It is very quiet in the Oort Cloud . There is a flux of galactic cosmic rays that slowly intrudes in THE // to the top meter or two of the comet . Each cosmic ray leaves a trail of broken chemical bonds behind it . As the fragments slowly reassemble themselves in the frigid and solid surface , new molecules are generated . If there is initial methane or carbon-monoxide ice , the net result over the age of the solar system will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but only in the outer shell of the comet . If you took a very slow stop-motion film of the cometary surface ( one frame every million years , say ) , the ices would gradually become darker and redder due to the complex organic molecules being synthesized . Suppose the comet is then nudged into the inner solar system . During a single perihelion passage , all of the processed ices would be vaporized to space  --  the work of a billion years undone in a month . The underlying ices revealed after the blowoff of the top meter will be close to their pristine form  --  pure white ice , if that is how the comet formed  --  or with a reddish primordial taint from the organic molecules of the interstellar medium that went into the comet in the first place . In any case , under the thin surface layer worked by cosmic rays is material virtually untouched since the beginning of the solar system . Why is the outer boundary of the Oort Cloud a hundred thousand astronomical units away ? Does the population of comets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumping into the Oort Cloud of some other star ? We might imagine the two cometary halos interdigitating , interpenetrating  --  the individual comets mingling , but widely separated  --  while remaining loyal to the stars around which they were born . Eventually , they pass on . But we now know that the Oort Cloud can not extend very far beyond a hundred thousand AUs . A Soviet astrophysicist , G.A . Chebotarev , has shown that the massive center of the Milky Way galaxy , 30,000 light-years from the Earth and Sun , is adequate to loosen the feeble gravitational grip of the Sun on any comet more distant than about 200,000 AUs . A small part of the mass of the center of the galaxy is probably provided by a black hole that resides there . Without the black hole , the Oort Cloud would be slightly bigger . Thus the Oort Cloud connects familiar events in this backwater of the inner solar system not only with the nearby stars but also with the center of the galaxy , so far away that , through the telescope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The comets that rush into our part of the solar system are from a skittish population made excitable by the passage of stars and nebulae . If the solar system were isolated from the rest of the galaxy , we would never know that comets exist  --  because then the passing stars and interstellar clouds would be unavailable to shake the Oort Cloud occasionally and send some comets fluttering into the inner solar system . And the number of comets that arrive down here ( as well as the external boundaries of the Oort Cloud from which they come ) may be determined in small measure by a black hole at the galactic center  --  an object undreamed of only a few decades ago . The comets are unexpectedly and profoundly connected with the Milky Way , a conclusion appropriate enough for Jan Oort , who perhaps more than any other person in the 20th century has revolutionized our knowledge of the galaxy . The scope of Oort 's idea is remarkable . To account for the handful of new comets that appear in our skies each year , a vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pluto is postulated . The idea explains what we know about comets in an elegant way that no other theory even approaches . The trillions of comets are now widely accepted by astronomers all over the world and called , properly , the Oort Cloud . Many scientific papers are written each year about the Oort Cloud , its properties , its origin , its evolution . Yet there is not yet a shred of direct observational evidence for its existence . We are not yet able to poke around in the Oort Cloud . No spacecraft has voyaged to count the comets there . It will be awhile before any do . There is one recent measurement that might conceivably be relevant , the discovery of distant wispy aggregations of matter by the Infrared Astronomy Satellite ; the contention that this is the structure of the Oort Cloud is , however , wildly controversial . But with the refinement of our scientific instruments , and the development of space missions to go far beyond Pluto , our chances of observing Oort Cloud comets will improve . There will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are not so foolish as to destroy ourselves first  --  when we will directly measure the population of the Oort Cloud , designate and characterize each of the large comets there , plot their orbits into the future , and perhaps make plans for their utilization . We do not know how long it will be until some representation of the Oort Cloud will be accumulated from real data . We wish the astronomers of that distant epoch well , and in our mind 's eye share with them the joy that they will surely take in those great discoveries to come . Comets may act as the creators , the preservers , and the destroyers of life on Earth . A surviving dinosaur might have reason to mistrust them , but humans might more appropriately consider the comets in a favorable light  --  as bringers of the stuff of life to Earth , as ocean-builders , as the agency that removed the competition and made possible the success of our mammalian ancestors , as possible future outposts of our species , and as providers of a timely reminder about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comet is also a visitor from the frigid interstellar night that constitutes by far the greatest part of the known universe . And a comet is , further , a great clock , ticking out decades or geological ages once each perihelion passage , reminding us of the beauty and harmony of the Newtonian universe , and of the daunting insignificance of our place in space and time . If , by chance , the period of a bright comet happens to be the same as a human lifetime , we invest it with a more personal significance . It reminds us of our mortality . ? ? ? And why would anyone go to such lengths , when there are perfectly adequate means of communication at hand ? Because , after the imminent arms race in anti-satellite weaponry gets going , communications satellites would be among the early casualties in a nuclear war .

A Hounds of Youth continued from page 73 pitiful to see . A razor-sharp claw had ripped down on an angle across his right eye . What I saw was almost more than I could stand . Far back in the soft belly , the slashing , razor-sharp claws of the lion had cut deep . In my inspections I had overlooked the wound . The walking and trotting motion of his body had started a heavy flow of blood . He whimpered as I laid my hand on his head . A warm , red tongue flicked out at it . With tears in my eyes I started talking to him . " Hang on , boy , " I said . " Everything will be all right . I 'll take care of you . " With trembling hands I packed the wound . Knowing that I could n't carry him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the side of a white-oak tree . I blew out the lantern and hung the handle over the other blade . I wrapped my dog in my old sheepskin coat and hurried for home . Arriving home , I awakened my mother and father . Together we doctored my dogs . Special care was given to Old Dan . The deep wound was sewed up and bandaged with a clean white cloth . We sat down and waited . Our wait was n't long . Slowly the heaving sides relaxed and the friendly gray eyes closed . My dog was gone . I picked him up , took him out on the porch , and laid him down . I went back inside and sat by the fireplace , lost in sorrow . Long after my mother and father had retired I sat by the fire . The hurt was so deep . I could n't think . It had engulfed my very soul . The crackling of the fire and the tick tock , tick tock , tick tuck of the grandfather clock seemed to blend in with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body of my dog . Stepping out on the porch , I saw a pitiful sight . Little Ann was snuggled up ever so close to the lifeless April ' 86 body of Old Dan . It was too much . I could n't stand it . I wanted to run . I ran down through the barn lot , on down into the fields , on and on to the riverbank . There in the gray shadows of a breaking dawn I cried the grief out of my heart . From rough pine slabs I made a box for my dog . Upon the hillside , at the foot of a beautiful red-oak tree , I dug his grave . There , where the wild blue violets and the beautiful green ferns would grow in the spring , I laid him away . I had a purpose in burying my dog up there on the hillside . It was a beautiful spot . From there one could see the country for miles  --  the long white crooked line of the river and the tall thick timber of the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought , perhaps , that on moonlit nights Old Dan would be able to hear the deep voices of the hounds as they rolled out of the river bottom on the frosty air . After the last shovel of dirt was patted in place , I sat down and let my mind drift back through the years . I thought of the old can I used for a bank , and the first time I saw my pups in the box at the depot . I thought of the $50 , the nickels and dimes , and the fishermen and blackberry patches . I looked at his grave and , with tears in my eyes , I voiced these words , " You were worth it , old friend , and a thousand times over . " In my heart I knew that there in the grave lay a man 's best friend . Two days later , when I came in from the bottom where my father and I were clearing land , my mother said , " Billy , you had better look after your dog . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I went to the barn , the corncrib , and looked under the porch . I called her name . It was no use . I was about to give up , and then I saw her . She had wiggled her way far back under the thorny limbs of a blackberry bush in the corner of the garden . I walked to her and tried to coax her out . She would n't budge . I got down on my knees and crawled back to her . As I did , she raised her head and looked at me . Her eyes told the story . They were n't the soft , gray eyes I had looked into so many times . They were dull and cloudy . There was no fire , no life . I could n't understand . I carried her back to the house . I offered her food and water . She would n't touch it . I noticed how lifeless she was . I thought perhaps she had a wound I had overlooked . I felt and probed with my fingers . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . He shook his head and said , " Billy , it 's no use . The life has gone out of her . She has no will to live . " That evening , when I came in from the fields , she was gone . I hurried to my mother . Mamma told me she had seen her go up the hollow from the house , so weak she could hardly stand . Mamma had watched her until she had disappeared in the timber . I hurried up the hollow , calling her name . I called and called . I went up to the head of it , still calling her name , and praying she would come to me . I climbed out onto the flats  --  looking , searching , and calling . It was no use . My dog was gone . I had a thought , a ray of hope . I just knew I 'd find her at the grave of Old Dan . I hurried there . I found her lying on her stomach , her hind legs stretched out straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had laid her head on his grave . I saw the trail where she had dragged herself through the leaves . The way she lay there , 1 thought she was alive . I called her name . She made no movement . With the last ounce of strength in her body , she had dragged herself to the grave of Old Dan . Kneeling down , I touched her . She was cold and lifeless . I could n't cry . The hurt was too deep . I was numb all over . I felt as cold and lifeless as the body of my little dog . Sitting down , I laid her head in my lap . Looking up to the heavens , I tried to see far beyond the vision of man , into the wonderful world of our God Almighty . In a choking voice I asked this question : " Why ? Why must I hurt so ? What have I donewrong ? You gave them to me . Why did You take them away ? " I walked back to the house . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I have something to say to you . " We went in and sat down . Mamma set our supper on the table . I could hear papa in the front room . I wondered what it was he wanted to talk to us about . When he came in , he had a small shoe box in his hand . A hallowed quietness settled over the room . Mamma came over and sat down . She had a sweet little smile on her face . Walking to the head of the table , papa laid the box down . Still standing , he took the lid off , reached inside and started lifting out bundles of money . He stacked them in a neat little pile . I could see that the box must have been almost full . Raising his head , he looked at me . " Billy , do you remember when you said a prayer and asked God to give you two hound pups ? " he asked . " Yes , sir , " I said . " That prayer was answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " but if He gave them to me , why did He take them away ? " Papa said , " Billy , God works in strange ways . You see , your mother April ' 86 has been praying too . She was asking help so she could take you and your sisters out of these hills and into town where you could get an education . Both prayers have been answered . He gave you the pups to make you happy . Through your pups , your mother 's prayer was answered . She is happy too . " Laying his hand on the money , he said , " This is the money earned by Old Dan and Little Ann . We now have enough to move to town . " I told papa I could see what he meant , but I still could n't understand why they were taken from me . He said , " Your mother and I had already decided not to separate you from your dogs . We knew how much you loved them . We were going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want that to happen . He does n't like to see families broken up . That 's why He called them back . He gave them to us as a gift . They had a job to do  --  the fulfillment of two prayers . When the job was done , He called them back . " Mamma said , " Someday you will all be married . You 'll probably be scattered , living in different parts of the country , but I want you to always remember the gift that God gave us , Old Dan and Little Ann . " Papa said , " Now let us bow our heads and give thanks for our food and for all the wonderful things God has done for us . " The next day I made another box , smaller than the first one . I buried Little Ann by the side of Old Dan . I also buried a part of me along with my dog . As I stood and looked at the graves , I said , " You came together , you hunted together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love you , and I 'll never forget you . " I 'm sure God made a heaven for all good dogs , and I know my dogs are there . I know He made rivers , mountains , tall timber , cornfields , and old rail fences . And in that heaven , on moonlight nights , the beautiful voices of my dogs can be heard along the banks of a blue river , over the mountains , fields , and valleys and on and on through the heavenly night .
