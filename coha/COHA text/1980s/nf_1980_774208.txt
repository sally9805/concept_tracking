txt  | some years earlier as superintendent had been so successful that it had become village folklore . He was an opinionated man who no doubt viewed my innovations with some suspicion . But I well realized that I must deal with him with some care , and I called at his farm before the Board meeting and boldly asked him for a two-year contract as an expression of confidence . He did not agree and I withdrew the suggestion . He then said some words of praise for my teaching which he said was reflected in the attitude of the students . But he said my writing was dreadful as compared with the Spencerian standards which he admired . I was compelled to agree and said I would attend some classes that summer in a business school in Cleveland . At the Board meeting I recommended a change in the arithmetic texts which had been used for many years . They were publications of the American Book Company which corporation had traditionally exercised great influence in local affairs . The new texts I had recommended were also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of routine , the Company had sent samples to all Board members . This infuriated Mr. Harding who charged that it was an attempted bribe . He also said that the old texts were good enough since they dated back to his administration . When he finished his defense of the status quo , he quoted the line from Pope , " Be not the first by whom the new is tried . " Someone has said that repartee is what you think of on the way home . I have since wondered why I did not reply with Pope 's next line , " nor to be the last to lay the old aside . " But even if I had thought of the reply , it would have been unwise to use it . So I said that since the American Book Company had been up to its old tricks , I would change my recommendation to a publication of Ginn and Company . This seemed to satisfy everybody . The new , I hoped , pure texts were adopted and I was duly hired for the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised by Harding were thus resolved , his disposition to peer over my shoulder in school affairs was not pleasant . I felt quite certain that he intended to dominate the school by a sort of remote control , and coming just at the moment when my spirits were rather high because of my successful completion of two good years , the prospect of more trouble with him disturbed me . In October , however , destiny intervened . Charles Harding died of typhoid fever . My experience with him , however , established in my mind a proposition which in later years was confirmed by many instances which did not concern me personally . This , which is now pretty well established in education , is that former professional teachers make very bad members of school governing boards from rural school systems to big universities . The professional member is  | likely to pick at details rather than to judge overall results . That summer I returned to the University of Michigan , after an unsuccessful effort to improve my handwriting . This time I enrolled in two courses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I attempted to enter the second year in law school . I also took a course in the English drama , for I entertained at that time an idea that I wanted to be a drama critic rather than a lawyer . At the end of the term I had a serious talk with the professor , telling him of my dilemma . After he heard my story , he said that I should stick to the law . I took the hint and forever dropped the dream of writing about the theater for pay and free admissions.  | In terms of remunerative labor , the thirty-two months of my life between the Christmas holidays in 1909 and September , 1912 were a complete loss . The reason for this interruption in the course of my teaching career was a catastrophic illness which knocked at the gate of my complacency . I saved some of that period from complete loss by rounding out the formal college education which Baldwin had failed to provide . I read a good deal , wrote a small unpublished book about Shakespeare , and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falls ended in May , 1909 , quite successfully . I secured reelection for another year , and presumably because of my proven competence in the village school , was given supervision of the six district schools of Olmsted Township . This responsibility was to be assumed in the fall of that year and since it would take another day in my week and entail visiting these schools on Saturdays , I was to receive an additional ten dollars a month from the Township Board . My plans for the coming year were made quite without calculation of the burden which I was bestowing upon my physical capabilities . Nor did I take note of certain warnings which my body sounded that summer when I spent two months at the University of Michigan . I had never worried about the demands I made on my constitution . Indeed as a schoolboy , I was quite a physical culturist , reading and practicing the lessons taught by Bernarr MacFadden in his magazine and books . Nothing bothered me that summer except certain fits of depression when I began doubting whether I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my habitual confidence in myself . Perhaps these fits were due to some hidden physical malaise . But I am quite sure that no medical examination would have found cause for alarm . When school was resumed in September , I confronted a full schedule . I spent the normal five days teaching and supervising things at Olmsted Falls . Then , according to my agreement with the Township Board of  | Education , I spent Saturdays visiting the district schools . They were scattered out on an average of two miles from my home in the village . The roads were especially muddy that year . Pavements were for the future when motor transport took over . My means of transportation was the old family horse and a light buggy , such as doctors used in the country . So six days were taken . Two evenings were mortgaged for a course in real property which was given by Newton Baker at the Cleveland Law School , a private commercial school owned by a prominent lawyer in Cleveland . This was really a foolish addition to my week , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interurban to Cleveland . After the class , it meant a return trip which ended shortly before midnight . The duties of village clerk were minimal but I ran and was elected without opposition . I developed a cough in October which I assumed would pass as many others had in a week or so . But this continued and got worse . So one evening when I reached Berea on the first leg of my trip to the law class , I decided to call on a doctor I knew . He found my temperature to be 100 and said that no doubt it had been running at that level for some time . His examination of my sputum confirmed his guess that I was suffering from tuberculosis . The news which I received was confirmed the following week by a Cleveland specialist , and I was told to seek treatment in the West . The Cleveland specialist , Dr. John Lowman , whose memory is honored now in the name of a building in the Western Reserve Medical School , was rather severe in his instructions . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should go to a sanatarium he knew in Silver City , New Mexico , and stay there a year . When I asked if I would recover , he said bluntly that he was a physician , not a prophet , but that if I followed orders , I would improve . And so I resigned my school jobs , my village clerk 's office , and on the day after Christmas I set forth on the trip to Silver City . Everything had happened so suddenly that I hardly had time to consider the full meaning of this disaster . But weeks and months of reflection in Silver City brought it all home . My teaching career , which had begun so happily more than three years before , was ended , perhaps forever . The money I had saved for law school was soon gone . And even after a year , if I recovered , I had no prospect of getting the money to take a law course which , because of this interruption , might be for the full three years . The termination of my service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for I loved to teach and the association with the students meant a great deal .  | But I found an antidote to regrets , not only in what reading I had taken with me , but in the reports of my improvement . The books I was able to carry with me included a set of Emerson 's Essays , Carlyle 's Essay on Burns , two books of Shakespeare criticism , and the fourth volume of Ward 's English Poets . These books are here with me as I write . In the Carlyle I heavily underscored a passage which gave me no end of satisfaction in the depressing days after my arrival : Manhood begins when we have in any way made truce with Necessity ; begins when we have surrendered to Necessity , as the most part only do ; but begins joyfully and hopefully when we have reconciled ourselves to Necessity ; and thus in reality conquered over it , and find that in Necessity we are free . The sanitarium to which Dr. Lowman sent me was about three miles north of Silver City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are large copper deposits up there and a considerable refinery at nearby Santa Rita . The altitude at the sanatarium was said to be about 6000 feet . There are cold freezing nights in the winter months , but bright sun almost every day , a suitable variation for clearing diseased lungs . The routine does not vary . A good night 's sleep , rest before and after meals , and sit in the sun most of the day . The morning after my arrival Dr. LeRoy Peters came to see me . He was then about thirty-five . He had migrated from Chicago a few years before with tuberculosis of the larynx and had spent two years recovering . His disposition was bouncy and optimistic . His professional skill was of a high order , spreading his name throughout the Southwest . Later , after my time under his care , he moved to Albuquerque where he was medical director of St. Joseph 's Sanatorium . He carefully examined me . In those days X-rays were not used for diagnosis . The stethoscope sufficed . His examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He confirmed Dr. Lowman 's diagnosis of a moderately advanced case . My blood pressure was alarmingly high , higher than it has ever been since . This he attributed to the altitude . He said that if I responded to treatment , I would have the infection arrested in " six to nine " months , and he cheered me by declaring that I would probably live twenty-five years . My temperature , which was 100 degrees the night of arrival , dropped to normal in two days and never during my whole stay in New Mexico went higher . My recovery , which was quite remarkable , was shown in the monthly examination , and in April my case was declared arrested .  | At about that time my good friend , John Bonsey , for whom , as I noted earlier , I wrote and delivered a commencement paper in 1903 , was a telegraph operator on the New York Central in Olmsted Falls when I left there . He decided shortly after my arrival in New Mexico to quit his job and follow me . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Santa Fe by carefully denying his union membership . He was stationed in a small village called Buchanan , located on a branch line in North Central New Mexico . So , with the doctor 's permission , I went up there to live with John in April . We greatly enjoyed those days and nights . He was busy during the days with his railway duties . I spent my time reading some books which the land agent had gathered . We kept house in a one-room affair out on the mesa . At night we dragged our beds out under the stars . That was the year of Haley 's Comet , and it kept vigil with us nightly . In June , when the days were getting hot , I returned to Olmsted Falls . Before leaving Silver City I secured an appointment for the coming school year as principal of the three-room school at Santa Rita , for Dr. Peters vouched for my health . I had every intention of returning in the fall to take up the business of school teaching again . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I greatly enjoyed resuming life among my old friends and former students . A month after my return , John Bonsey resigned his job with the Santa Fe and returned to the New York Central in Olmsted Falls . I had every reason to believe that I could live the normal life that had characterized other summers at home . I slept out in the open and regularly took my temperature every morning and afternoon . But a sense of euphoria induced by my quick recovery led me to make a series of mistakes which ended in another disaster . The first was a game of tennis which I played on a hot afternoon in early August . The next morning before rising I was horrified to note that I had a temperature of ninety-eight degrees which meant over ninety-nine degrees in the afternoon . I knew then that the exercise had torn open the sleeping infection and that I was in trouble . Dr. Lowman was on a vacation when I visited Cleveland the next day but another doctor examined me and declared that " the bugs are active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans completely . It would never do to return to Santa Rita and endeavor to teach school with active tuberculosis . So I wrote resigning the appointment . I then decided to follow the example of a former classmate at Baldwin University , a Berea boy named John Morrissey . He apparently had been troubled by weak lungs and left Berea and took a law degree at the Law School of the University of Colorado at  | Boulder . The news in Berea told that he was practicing law in Denver in 1910 and doing well . I solved the money problem , at least for a year , by borrowing $350 from Grandmother Moley . I made the necessary preparations and arrived in Denver on the afternoon of September 3 , 1910 . Had I been able to see Dr. Lowman , he would have dissuaded me from an attempt to undertake the arduous task of a law student with a temperature rising above ninety-nine every afternoon and a persistent cough . I foolishly believed that a high dry climate would soon restore the arrested case that I had thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great creator of illusion . On my arrival in Denver I registered at the old Oxford Hotel near the railway station . Then I called my old friend John Morrissey at his office where fortunately ? or unfortunately as it proved ? I found him on a Saturday afternoon . I met him at dinner and told him of my plans to go to Boulder . After dinner he suggested that we take a " tram " out to an amusement park . We spent an hour or so watching the dancing , and on our return to town the crowd on the " tram " was so great that we were compelled to crawl in a window . I left him at the hotel and went up to the room to which I had been assigned . The clerk was very sorry but due to congestion he had been compelled to put two other guests in my room . They were asleep when I arrived . After unlocking the door and entering the room , I coughed softly to make sure that I would not awaken my sleeping companions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the lighted bathroom my fear was confirmed . It was a considerable hemorrhage . This had never happened before but my experience told me what to do . I got into bed and rested quietly on my back . After a few moments I called the desk and asked for a doctor . The doctor was a woman and she did all that anyone could do . Put an ice pack on my chest and administered a strong sleeping pill . I slept profoundly and when I awakened my two sleeping companions were gone . Since I was always hungry in the morning , I ordered a heavy breakfast and ate it . This was another of what had already been a tragic series of mistakes . Then followed a most distressing day . I tried repeatedly to reach Morrissey but since it was Sunday I had no success . 6 Twice that morning and once in the early afternoon , there were more effusions of blood . The woman doctor of the night before had vanished . Finally in the middle of the afternoon I spoke with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implored him to get me a doctor . Shortly after , a doctor phoned . I explained and his very intelligent and  | helpful reply was that he was not a lung specialist but would have someone call me who was better equipped to help . I have always believed that this good turn by a doctor I never saw and whose name I never knew was the turning point in a series of incidents which might have taken my life . For in those years Denver , as well as many cities in the Southwest , was ridden with quacks who preyed upon the thousands of " lungers " who were sent by Eastern doctors , who told their patients that all they needed was the dry air and ? God help us ? exercise . In other words , the " roughing it " advice they gave claimed more lives in the West than all the Indian wars . What happened that afternoon was providential , for the doctor who came to see me in response to the promise I had received over the telephone was without doubt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vastly more than a physician . He was called a physiological chemist , one of the pioneers in what came to be known as bio-chemistry . That afternoon , however , he was only the physician taking the steps appropriate to my critical condition . He gave me a brief examination , asked me a few questions , specifically my home address and the name of my mother , arranged to have a nurse come and remain overnight , and to have me moved to St. Luke 's Hospital the next morning . The next morning as the nurse was taking my temperature , I stole a glance at the thermometer . It was 105 . I was moved to the hospital where Dr. Sewall made sure to say that my illness was not TB , for in those days , due to the immense number of " lungers , " the hospitals had to deny them admittance . During the first week my temperature fell below 100 and I believed that I was on the way to recovery . This was good news when my mother arrived . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse . It reached 102 degrees or more every afternoon . My experience the winter before told me what that meant . If these very high temperatures continue for a month or so , the disease , which in a young person is so acute , is likely to have spread so widely that recovery is probably impossible . The supreme proof of my good fortune in having as a physician a man who had already achieved high distinction as a scientist came after I had been in the hospital about three weeks . Dr. Sewall recognized as I did that unless the infection could be checked , the outlook was bad . He therefore decided upon what he told me months later was an experiment which came of his long studies in biological chemistry . He injected what he told me was a serum taken from the neck of an infected horse . As I remember , the stuff was called  | " streptolytic " serum . The mischief which was bent on destroying me was what was called a mixed infection , in which the TB bacilli are supplemented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause the fever , for the TB " bugs " are not virulent enough to cause high temperatures . The effect of the injection was amazing , for the temperature dropped the next day from the routine 102 to 99 degrees , and it never went above 100 in all the months I remained in Denver . After another two weeks , my mother found an apartment near the hospital with a sleeping porch and I began the long and familiar business of " chasing the cure . " Dr. Sewall called frequently , when on his visits to the hospital , and kept us cheered with encouraging predictions of ultimate recovery . When the temperature fell to normal I started a regimen of daily walks and in November the question arose about my getting on with my law studies . I had learned from John Morrissey that the University of Denver had a law school in downtown Denver where the classes were held afternoons and evenings . I asked Dr. Sewall about this and he strongly advised against it . He said that downtown there was too much dust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . But he said that he would not object to my taking graduate courses in the liberal arts division of the University of Denver which was two or three miles out on the " tram . " This advice placed before me a profoundly important decision . I said that I wanted a few days to think . I had always considered the profession of law merely as an avenue to public life and politics . With this barred , what was the alternative ? It was rare good fortune for me that in the election two weeks before , Woodrow Wilson had been elected Governor of New Jersey . I had admired Wilson for many years , for when I gathered college catalogues at the turn of the century , I noted in the Princeton catalogue that there was a man named Woodrow Wilson whose title was McCormick Professor of Jurisprudence . ... I had been amazed at the time that somebody could get paid for teaching politics which to me at that time meant something quite different than the classical stuff which went by that name at Princeton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this man . I read whatever I could find about him or by him . I noted that he had been elected president of Princeton in 1902 , and since he was pretty much in the public eye after that , he was not hard to follow . In 1908 he delivered some lectures at Columbia University and my favorite magazine columnist , Samuel Blythe , ran a piece in the Saturday Evening Post on his page " Who 's Who and Why " about something Wilson had said in those lectures . In discussing the  | presidency , he said that the President " is the national voice . " Therefore , said Blythe , Dr. Wilson naturally wants to be President . This was one of the earliest notices of Wilson 's presidential availability . A bit later , there was considerable news about Wilson 's controversy at Princeton about the location of the proposed Graduate School . His resignation as president of Princeton followed , and very recently his nomination as the Democratic candidate for Governor . I summed all this up as applying to my own career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high level of the office of governor , why should I go on grubbing at the law ? Why not be a professor ? It is probable that Dr. Sewall encouraged my choice of a career , since his whole life until he came to Denver was in the academic world . And so the decision was made and I registered for courses in political science and economics , traveling to the University three times a week . In January my mother left for home and I moved to a sanatarium for convalescents . Since my studies were not at all difficult , I spent a great deal of time that winter at the Denver Public Library , reading Shakespearean criticism and making notes for a small book which I completed the following year . It rests securely among the unpublished manuscripts in my files . I concluded after finishing it that I was not equipped to venture into the crowded field of Shakespearean scholars . The busy schedule which I had for the winter months of 1911 seemed to prosper my convalescence . So as the summer was drawing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to Ohio , especially because for two winters I had been a heavy burden which my family was ill equipped to bear . The loan from my Grandmother Moley had long since been exhausted and I well understood the managing that went on at home to meet the costs of my long stay in Denver . The death of my mother 's mother , however , brought to her some securities which paid good dividends , although I suspect that she hocked some of them to secure a considerable loan . But I was greatly helped by the monthly loan from my friend John Bonsey , who had remained in Ohio with a good job with the New York Central . In 1916 he fell ill of tuberculosis and I was able to repay all that he had loaned . Dr. Sewall agreed to my return to Ohio but he warned me that I must return to a dry climate by March , " the pneumonia month on the shores of the Great Lakes . " 71 When I returned to Olmsted Falls , I was determined that this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was resolved to  | make no more mistakes . I suppose that I should have sought some remunerative work but so far as teaching was concerned , Dr. Sewall 's orders that I return to the West to avoid the bad spring months stood in the way . I was ill equipped for any other sort of employment except common labor . So I decided , quite selfishly , I admit , that I could do more for myself and my long-suffering family in a year or two by further preparation for teaching . I decided to continue my graduate work by taking some courses at Oberlin . The high standards at Oberlin would not admit me as a candidate for the M.A. on the basis of my graduation from Baldwin . So I had to throw in several other odds and ends of eduation which I had gathered on the way . These included some courses I had finished at the summer terms at Ann Arbor , two legal courses I had taken privately at the Cleveland Law School , and what I had taken at the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Oberlin on the train three days a week for the first semester only since I assumed that I must return to Denver in March . Meanwhile the political pot was boiling in Olmsted Falls . An old friend , Bob Fletcher , was a retired contractor who had moved out to Olmsted Falls . He was then in his hale and hearty seventies . Unlike most of the former Cleveland residents , whom the natives contemptuously called the " Four Hundred , " Fletcher 's associations and sympathies were with the " natives . " I could rate very well as a " native " since my father and grandfather had lived there since before the Civil War . Shortly after my arrival he told me that I should run for Mayor . He promised to manage my campaign and run for the Council himself . He said that the Four Hundred were determined to take over the town government and institute a lot of what they called " improvements " which were probably not necessary and would be incompetently managed . He said further that if I ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a majority of the Council , institute some real improvements with more efficiency than they could show . I agreed to run with the proviso that I would have to return West in the spring . We planned to meet that possibility by having Fletcher as president of the Council take over for me . It was a lively campaign , for the Four Hundred had a slate of candidates , including a blue-nosed yankee for Mayor . This man was a Unitarian and Fletcher had a curious way of defining my opponent 's faith : " You know what he is ? He 's a second handed Jew . " I asked what he meant by that expression . " A Jew , " he answered , " thinks that Christ ai n't  | come yet . But a Unitarian says that He came but was n't no good . " That is a definition which I have never heard since . In the election I was successful and our slate won a good majority of the Council . In that majority my father was numbered . Fletcher and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be to bring electric lights to the village . Our plan was to purchase the electric power from some outside source , measure it at the village limits and then , after providing lighting for the streets , sell the power to the residents at a price which would pay the cost of the public installations . To raise the money for these installations , which included the lines through the village , we proposed a bond issue to be submitted to the voters . We easily won that vote since some of the commuters who were friendly to me came over to our side , and the rest of the Four Hundred could not very well oppose a greatly needed addition to the life of the village . Now with the money we realized from the bond issue , Fletcher managed the installation of the lines . The problem remained to make contracts for the power . At first there were two possible sources . One was the offer of the interurban railway that passed through Berea . The terms were satisfactory but the objection was that electric lighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lights were lowered whenever a car of the line started . The other possibility was to buy power from the municipally owned plant in Berea . The town of Berea offered to sell us what we needed and build the transmission line to us . I then remembered Tom Johnson 's final view of public ownership . His opinion was that it is not necessary to have government ownership if service can be had from privately owned utilities with adequate protection for the rate payers , and that the danger in public ownership , which means politically oriented ownership , is inefficiency or corruption , or both . I could not be sure that the Berea plant would give reliable service , and I doubted whether the municipal plant could long compete with the big Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company . So I rejected the offer . My judgment was vindicated a few years later when the municipality sold their plant to the private company . We were at this pass when a man came to see me . He represented the Milligan Company , a subsidiary of the great Doherty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant in Lorain and since they were extending a transmission line in the direction of Cleveland , they would like to have Olmsted Falls as a customer . I was immediately interested for it was evident that since their line would pass close to our village , we might get a  | very good bargain . After some negotiating about a guarantee of continuous and reliable service , they agreed to a figure which would give us a substantial profit which we could use to pay for the street lighting . The figure they fixed in making a ten-year contract was so low that a few years later they appealed to the village to grant an increase . At that time the village clerk could not find the old contract . He appealed to me for a copy . My habit of saving all important papers served well . I had a copy and the company was held to the old rate for the life of the contract . The lessons I learned from this experience conditioned my views on the subject of public utilities for all the years after . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Olmsted Falls involved microscopic amounts . But the principle of private versus public ownership was the same as that which was involved in later years in the Tennessee Valley . Grand Coulee and Hells Canyon . When the public interest is concerned , it is best to leave ownership and management in private hands with strict public regulation of rates to the public and access to the courts for enforcement . When construction is of such massive proportions , as was true of the Hoover Dam , it may be necessary in a few cases to bring in the government to raise the huge costs of construction . But the provision that Mr. Hoover made to have contracts for the sale of power which will cover the outlays of the government until the whole project is paid for is a wise protection of all concerned . It is true that old fashioned progressives may rant about the " power trust " and claim that only with public ownership can the public be protected , but this belongs to another age . Control is what is needed , not ownership . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished cities , Cleveland , in the twenty years following the election of Tom L. Johnson , will never rank near the top with those which left great art and architecture to grace the centuries . Nor will it rank high in such planning marvels as Haussman created for Napoleon the Lesser . But it had a singular virtue all its own . It can be claimed that in those years it had a record of social and political innovation and general public enlightenment that give it shining distinction among the most shabby urban centers of the early twentieth century . Life was , to perceptive citizens , an exciting experience and to me , coming after twenty years in a village broken by a period of illness , an exciting adventure of the mind . I was carried along during the nine Johnson years as a witness and then from 1912 to 1923 as a resident and later , in a small way , a participant in the life of Cleveland . With the coming of spring , 1912 I was reminded of my promise to Dr. Sewall to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West . I consulted Dr. Lowman who had originally sent me to New Mexico . After an examination he declared me well enough to face the bitter spring winds off Lake Erie , and advised me to stay . When I asked him for a definition of how to stay well , he gave me this advice : " Respect fatigue . Never eat a heavy meal or exercise when you are tired . And once a week go to bed at eight o'clock . " It was a very busy spring . There were my courses at Oberlin to finish . Also my duties as Mayor , for Bob Fletcher and I were supervising the construction of the lines which would carry electricity through the village . The newspapers were full of political news , for there was a bitter feud between Theodore Roosevelt and Taft over the Republican nomination . Since this break gave the Democrats hope for the first time in fifteen years , the Democratic nomination was a tempting prize . Finally there was among my concerns the getting of a teaching job for the coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was pregnant that year with a quite promising hopeful , Judson Harmon , the Democratic Governor . The Governor was a serious candidate . He was a Cincinnati lawyer and judge who had served in the final years of the Cleveland Administration as Attorney General . In 1912 he was in his second term as Governor . Baker , Mayor of Cleveland , was opposed to the nomination of Harmon , not only because he believed Harmon to be too conservative , but because of the traditional rivalry between Northern and Southern Ohio . More important , Baker was passionately supporting Woodrow Wilson whom he knew when they were both at Johns Hopkins . I watched the Wilson-Harmon contest with great interest because of my admiration for Wilson . I saw an opening to help when Harmon 's manager accused Wilson of bigotry . It seemed that Harmon 's manager , Ed Moore of Youngstown , an ardent Catholic , had found some references in Wilson 's writings to Catholics as Papists . Since this expression was anathema to Catholics of that generation , Moore claimed that this use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had Protestant clergymen on both sides of his family . In the course of the winter I had looked up and read everything about Wilson in the Oberlin library . I had found a reprint of a speech Wilson had made to a convention of Protestant clergymen , and in his remarks he had drawn an invidious comparison between Protestant ministers and Catholic priests in their concern for the people in their communities . His remarks indicated that since priests carried with them certain attributes of divinity their status and their services far outweighed the worldly and secular image created by the Protestant ministers . This , it seemed to me , was ample proof of Wilson 's complete freedom from bias . And so I prepared a letter to the Plain Dealer which was bristling with quotations . I sought and obtained an interview with Baker . I showed him the letter and told him of my discovery of the Wilson speech . He thought I had made a real point and used his influence with the editor to publish it . He said , incidentally , that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my first important meeting with Baker . At the Baltimore Convention later that summer Baker 's great speech against the unit rule did a great deal to win the nomination for Wilson and enabled Baker 's delegates pledged to Wilson to break the solid Harmon delegation from Ohio . In the balloting , however , Harmon received 148 votes on the first ballot . Baker was essentially a liberal in the true and classic sense of that  | word . His support of the principle of freedom of speech and the press was shown in his administration of the War Department during the First World War , and his defense of the press in his later law practice . Despite the charge of socialism during the Johnson years and during his terms as Mayor , he was a firm believer in the institution of private enterprise . This was shown in some of his notable speeches in the TVA litigation , in which he represented the companies affected by the Government 's adventure in state socialism . When he left office at the end of the Wilson Administration , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And in 1932 , when some of his proteges sought to get him the nomination , he gave them absolutely no encouragement . 8 When he returned to Cleveland in 1921 and formed a law firm , he entered into the civic life of the city . In those years , when I served as Director of the Cleveland Foundation , I came to know Baker quite well . We both served on several committees . Altogether , I am sure that if he had been nominated and elected and had his health permitted , he would have been one of our great Presidents . Baker 's style in public speaking invites comparison with his friend , Woodrow Wilson . Emerging from the age of flamboyant oratory of the Bryan-Bob Ingersoll type , Baker , like Wilson , favored the conversational mode of a good college lecturer . There were few gestures other than the lifted finger for emphasis . His discourse was a marvel of sentence structure , for the words came in obedience to the discipline of a well ordered mind . First on the list in 1912 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , if possible , but anything for the next year to make me self-supporting . It was not easy that year for the teaching market was tight . I knew something of West High School , at that time the only city high school west of the Cuyahoga River . I learned that a loyal graduate of Oberlin was Principal and that he was at the moment in Oberlin . So I went to see him . In the course of our talk he said that there was no opening at the moment . I felt , however , that I had registered an impression . With the aid of a teacher 's agency to provide me with clues , I traveled far and wide in Northern Ohio with no success . Finally , I conceived the idea that I might have better luck with the Catholic high school . A prominent Catholic priest on Cleveland 's West Side was supervisor of the high schools in the entire Diocese . I went to see him and told my story and offered my credentials . When he asked why I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most unfortunate blunders of my life .  | " Because , " I said , " I think 1 am being discriminated against because I am a Catholic . " This was a double mistake . First , because I was indicating that having exhausted my first choices , I had turned to Catholic schools as a last resort , an affront to the very schools that this man was directing . The other mistake is shown in what the reverend father said : " You Catholic boys are always whining about discrimination when all that stands against you is your own incompetence . Go on and make good and you will find that Protestants will take you without a thought about your religion . I would not think of hiring you after that remark . " So I left his rectory without a job , with my ego smarting after his lashing , a reminder forever of the lessons I learned that day . One morning about that time I was on the train bound for Oberlin when I noted in the newspaper that J.M.H. Frederick had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sorts of bells in my mind . In response to these , I fashioned a plan which took me off the train at Elyria , halfway to Oberlin , and to a car on the interurban bound back to Cleveland . For I had a slight acquaintance with Frederick . He had been Superintendent of Schools in Lakewood , a big suburb of Cleveland , for some years and a member of the examining board which passed on teacher 's certificates . In the course of my career , I had taken the examination three times . Frederick had marked the papers in English literature and my grades had been inordinately high , on the last occasion being 100 per cent . Apparently this had been sufficiently unusual to bring me some attention from Frederick , who congratulated me and at two or three county teacher 's meetings had mentioned my interest in English , his own favorite subject . I knew from the papers that he had resigned his position in Lakewood after some controversy and , since he still held his membership on the Examining Board , occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly there and since it was still fairly early in the morning , he was not too busy to see me before the rush of people who would besiege the new Cleveland Superintendent . Frederick was a giant of a man , outstanding in any crowd . He was also an educator of the old school , a strict disciplinarian , and inflexible in his very high standards . He was also a school politician of considerable talent which accounted for his rise in the profession . Now after his vindication had come with his election by the Cleveland Board , he was at the moment enjoying the triumph . He was destined to serve his full five-year term . He greeted me pleasantly and listened with apparent interest as I told him of my adventures since my teaching at Olmsted Falls , and especially of my  | continued studies and my present need of a job . He said he would certainly keep me in mind . So I had touched two bases , Simpson , the Principal at West High School , and the man at headquarters who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for in June while I was on a train bound for a national meeting of school administrators in Chicago , I met Frederick again . This time our conversation was about politics and I distinctly remember that he said that he was for Taft , if it meant that his vote would be one of the few that the distracted President would have . I did not reveal my own choice . In Chicago the man at the teacher 's agency told me to see the Superintendent from South Omaha who was looking for a high school teacher who could , in addition to a schedule of classes , coach the football team . My desperate need for a job prompted me to accept . When school days returned , I presented myself in South Omaha and started my teaching assignments . When I met the football squad , I made a few pleasant remarks and laid down a few rules about discipline . From what I could learn in these first days , it appeared that in football South Omaha 's high school team was high in its class . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Superintendent , he had regarded the coaching part of my assignment as secondary and , knowing little of the site of the city and the high school , I had not taken the task seriously . But I was reassured when I had a conference with some of the " veterans " on the team , especially the captain and star quarterback , for I realized that the team could do a lot about managing itself with me to encourage the boys and maintain discipline . On my way to the boarding house that evening , I had only slight concern about the job . Indeed it seemed like a pleasant prospect . But when I reached the place where I had engaged a room , there was a telegram for me . When I opened the message , the contents overwhelmed me with joy . It was from David Simpson of West High and he asked me to fill a vacancy in his faculty that had appeared at the last minute . The news was so good that I wondered if someone was playing a trick . Hence when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked for a confirmation . The confirmation came and I retired to a sleepless night of decision . On the side of returning to Ohio and to Cleveland of all possible places , the advantages were overwhelming . This offer carried with it limitless possibilities . But there was the moral question of leaving South Omaha after a week 's service . Those were the days when teachers were hired and fired and paid like  | common laborers . Boards of Education considered it routine to dismiss a teacher overnight for the most capricious reasons . There were no rules , adopted after years of pressure from teachers , regarding tenure . Teachers ' unions were unthought of and so were union contracts . In a situation like the one I faced , it was the individual teacher against the big school establishment , the Superintendent with the Board behind him . I weighed the values one against the other . It would be a matter of temporary inconvenience for the school to get another teacher . But to me it was a turning point in my life . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the one at West High . I decided to leave . The next day I told the Superintendent all the reasons for accepting the Cleveland offer . He was sympathetic enough and accepted my resignation . The high school Principal was a bit unpleasant but this merely strengthened my determination to leave . I found as I was preparing for the train that I was short of money , a quite normal circumstance with me . So I borrowed the necessary train fare from a kindly Catholic priest . Once again the Church of Rome was the Good Samaritan . I borrowed again when I arrived in Cleveland to repay the priest . Whatever moralists may say about how I resolved that crisis , I found that at West High David Simpson reassured me . I faced something like this decision years later when despite my acceptance of a position on the faculty of the University of Minnesota , I accepted the Directorship of the Cleveland Foundation . In that case the University , in a wholly friendly way , acquiesced in my decision to accept the offer in Cleveland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave of absence . This , I have always regarded as most generous . David Simpson had spent many years at West High as a teacher and Principal . In Cleveland in those years the high school Principal was a well known institution . He was a dominant factor in the cultural and civic life of his jurisdiction . Simpson was a man of superior academic equipment and general culture . He was an impressive figure with a full and greying beard . He looked older than his fifty years . Once , when Mayor Baker came to speak in the high school auditorium , Simpson , in introducing him , said that to prove that he was younger than he looked , he revealed that he had been a student at the feet of the boyish-looking Mayor . He referred to his study at the Cleveland Law School in Baker 's course in Real Property , the course I had taken briefly before my illness . Simpson followed a tradition established by his predecessor who did not believe in assigning the subjects to teachers who had specialized in  | them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would aim above the heads of their students . So Simpson , ignoring my interest in civil government and history , assigned two sections of ancient history and two in geometry . Two years later , when he gave me two sections in freshman English , which meant reading endless compositions , I protested , saying , " I ca n't do justice to these children . " He answered , " They do n't want justice , they want mercy . " Most of the faculty were in their late middle years and seemed settled there for life . Three were refugees from the miserable salaries paid them as professors in Baldwin University , my alma mater . I found teaching ancient history quite enjoyable . To liven the subject , I made an arrangement with a young woman whose subject was arts and crafts to supervise my students in making drawings of important buildings in ancient Greece and Rome . Also I introduced map books to be filled in and assigned considerable reading in the little school library . I worked my students to the limit but kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writing of the essay required for the master 's degree . In casting about for a subject which carried with it some flavor of the law , I selected the Cleveland Municipal Court . This court modeled after the Chicago Municipal Court was an innovation in the administration of justice . It supplanted the old justices of the peace and had civil and criminal jurisdiction , since the judges acted as examining magistrates . It was a compact court with a chief justice whose duties were mostly administrative . It had eight or nine judges elected in the municipal election . The plans for the new court had been made by a committee of the Cleveland Bar Association . In consulting one of the members of that committee , I learned that the most constructive member had been a lawyer named Manuel Levine , who was elected a judge when the court was launched . I sought him out and established not only an invaluable contact with the civic life of the city , but won a warm and generous friend . In all my eleven years in Cleveland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like so many of Johnson 's former proteges , a humanitarian and a bit of a philosopher . He had been given a small job by Johnson in the City Solicitor 's office . As our friendship developed , he took me to lunch on many Saturdays . From what he told me in these meetings I was able to describe in my essay not only the nature and purpose served by the Municipal Court but a great deal of the social life of the city which the Court served . For Levine , without leaning too far toward that permissiveness which has characterized later developments in jurisprudence , was quite familiar at first hand with the  | complex life of Cleveland . He called my attention to the writings of Roscoe Pound on the problems of administering justice in a great city , a departure from formal judicial administration which came to be called " sociological jurisprudence . " Levine , the innovator , was already looking beyond his contribution to the creation of the Court , to the development within it of a division which he called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which small civil disputes were disposed of by agreement of the parties under the encouragement and supervision of the assigned judge . In his reading and his contacts with natives of the Scandinavian countries , he found that something similar to this had been introduced into the practice of the courts in the Dakotas by natives of the Scandinavian countries . There , it had suited the problems of a rural population . Levine 's contribution was its introduction into the teeming and contentious life of a city . Following the example established in Cleveland , many other such tribunals were later established in other cities . Mostly these are called " small claims courts . " The following summer I submitted the completed essay and was granted the M.A. degree . I have always since been listed in the Oberlin class of 1913 . I made further use of this essay . In a shortened form I sent it to the National Municipal Review , and saw the first of my writings in print . The second year at West High passed without serious incident except an attack of rheumatism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall term . A pleasant diversion during the winter was coaching the debating team . We had only fair results , losing one of the two debates with the other city high schools . This may have been the result of poor coaching or poor material . When spring came , I decided to further my preparation for college teaching by taking a leave of absence for graduate study . In planning for this , I consulted Professor Karl F. Geiser with whom I had studied political science at Oberlin . One of his passionate interests in teaching had been to prepare a few students for graduate study . He was a thorough scholar and strict disciplinarian . This may have been due to his German ancestry and also his graduate study in Berlin . His preference for his students who elected graduate work was Columbia and during the year I spent there , there were ten other Oberlin students . When I seriously began to consider another year of graduate study , Geiser strongly urged me to select Columbia , largely because I would have the advantage there of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influence of Geiser , Oberlin that spring had selected Beard as Commencement speaker .  | This gave me the opportunity to see and hear him and if possible to have a conference with him . This was easily accomplished for after the program I saw Beard in his dressing room . . . . He advised me to come to his office at Columbia when I arrived in New York in September . Meanwhile he suggested a list of readings during the summer . Also he suggested that I brush up on my French and German , a reading familiarity with these languages being a requirement for the doctorate . During the summer months , which I spent at home in Olmsted Falls , I seriously followed Beard 's suggestions . I was fairly sure of my reading knowledge of French , although languages have never been easy for me . But I bitterly regretted then that ten years before I had not availed myself , while a student at Baldwin , of the German courses taught by the excellent native Germans at German-Wallace . However , I started at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this when in August the great war exploded in Europe . I continued my German and Professor Geiser got me a copy of Woodrow Wilson 's book , The State , translated into German . This sufficed as a pony . The outbreak of the war brought troubled years to Geiser on the Oberlin campus . I visited Geiser in Oberlin that August and found him greatly agitated . He had in class and in discussions around the campus been highly critical of British policy . Impressed by his views I found myself to be far from an enthusiastic supporter of the Allies , but I kept my views to myself until the danger of involvement of the United States became serious . Then I vigorously opposed our participation . In Geiser 's case , his German origins , his name , his graduate studies in Berlin and his outspoken criticism of the British made him a mark for the wave of intolerance that swept American life , especially on the college campuses . Indeed the sentiment became so heated in Oberlin that Geiser suffered intense mental anguish . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dismissal . But while no official action was taken , since the president of Oberlin was a great and respected liberal , Henry Churchill King , Geiser 's classroom performance suffered . Those whose memory goes back only to World War II can not realize the intensity of pro-English and anti-German opinion in World War I. The intolerance extended to everything German . Professors of German deserted by students often transferred to other subjects or left the profession . School boards across the country eliminated German from the curricula . German music was dropped from concerts . In my own home I simply did not play Beethoven on the Victrola . I was at Western Reserve University after 1916 and witnessed the changes there which were at-  | tributable to anti-German sentiment . Professor Springstein changed his name to Mountcastle . At Barnard I learned later the good and kindly Professor Wilhelm Broun became Will Brown . Perhaps it is a sign of social progress that there was no revulsion against German culture in the 1940s . In September , with what money I had saved in the preceding years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later to borrow , I found myself in New York and at Columbia . It was my first view of a city in which I was destined to spend so much of my later life .  | Columbia and Beard before the W ar I shall have a great deal to say in this narrative of the contrast between the Columbia University I knew as a student in the autumn of 1914 and the Columbia I lived with as a member of the faculty after 1923 . Under the leadership of John W. Burgess , who founded the Faculty of Political Science , and Nicholas Murray Butler , who assumed the presidency in 1902 , there had been gathered , at least in the humanities , an array of brilliant scholars which , without doubt , exceeded in original exploration of their chosen fields not only any other individual university in America , but in sheer aggregate of talent , all of the major universities combined . All over the nation Columbia was the graduate school where most college undergraduate teachers sent their students for post-graduate study in the social sciences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew Geiser of Oberlin . In the summer after my decision to ask for a leave of absence at West High , and my interview with Beard at Oberlin , I had remained at home in Olmsted Falls reading and somewhat indifferently studying a German grammar . The war in Europe which broke out in August was somewhat disturbing but its great impact , which was felt along the Atlantic seaboard , lost most of its meaning when it reached our quiet Ohio village . My own feeling was without partisanship . If I had been pressed for an opinion , I would probably have indicated that the issues involved had little meaning for an American in the Middle West . It was simply not in even the remotest recesses of speculation that there ever would be danger of the United States being involved in the conflict . My first impression of New York City was of what I saw from the car window , as the train entered the city and wound its way through Harlem and entered the Grand Central Station . There were the miles and miles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Cleveland . The wretched inhabitants were leaning out of the windows or crowded in the streets below . This sociological bit I mentioned to Beard when I saw him 73  | the next day . He remarked that those people would never know the difference between a pig sty and a cattle corral . Harlem was only partially black at that time . It was much later that the great migration from the South scattered the white population of Harlem through the city . Indeed 125th Street was not an unpleasant shopping center for the Columbia people up the hill . In many evenings , even after I had moved permanently to New York nine years later , I used the streets down to 125th Street for evening walks and stopped in some book stores there . One of the married graduate students , whom I came to know that first year , lived with his wife in the Hotel Theresa at 125th and Seventh Avenue . I had reserved a room in Furnald Hall , a Columbia residence building on Broadway near 116th Street . My room , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second semester I moved to a room far uptown at St. Nicholas and 191st Street . I first called at the office of Frank Fackenthal , Secretary of the University , and compromised my aversion to debt by borrowing $75 for tuition . This I paid back the next year and never borrowed again during my student year . Then I called at Beard 's office in Hamilton Hall , a building reserved for the undergraduate men . This was characteristic of Beard 's interest in undergraduate teaching ; most of the professors with whom I had courses were housed in the Kent Law School building across the street . After a few preliminary comments , Beard suggested that I register for the following courses : History of Political Theories with Professor William A. Dunning . International Law with John Bassett Moore . Corporation Problems and Labor Problems with Henry A. Seager . Constitutional History and Principles of Politics with Beard . Constitutional Law with Thomas Reed Powell . Municipal Government with Howard Lee McBain . Beard was to be absent during the second semester so it was fortunate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his major graduate offerings . Many other courses were popular with students and I took advantage of the freedom which was allowed to visit them . Notable were James Harvey Robinson 's lectures on The Intellectual History of Western Europe . This course was literally mobbed . There were some others which I enjoyed occasionally like Giddings in sociology and Felix Adler 's lectures in ethics . I tried John Dewey 's lectures once or twice but gave up . I could barely hear him and what I could hear , I could not understand .  | What I noted at once was the complete absence of the leisurely life that had prevailed in the other higher institutions I had known . In part , this might have been due to Columbia 's location in a throbbing metropolitan center . These professors were busy men , intensely concerned with their writing and research , although available to students during their office hours . The most famous of the professors I knew at Columbia was John Bassett Moore . Moore had entered the State Department in 1885 and , after serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Columbia in 1891 . President McKinley summoned him to the State Department again in 1898 where he served as Assistant Secretary of the Department , the highest office at that time under the Secretary . But after a year he resigned to return to Columbia because , it was rumored , he could not endure the disorderly administrative habits of the Secretary ... . The international commissions and conferences in which he served and the many foreign and domestic honors he had received made a long list . Despite this busy life , he had written or edited a sizable library of books and articles . In 1914 he was only fifty-four years of age but the distinctions he had won , and the appearance he carefully cultivated , encouraged me to believe he was in the twilight of his career . His lectures were little more than a few questions directed at members of the class whom he seemed to know , or interesting anecdotes gathered from his long experience in diplomacy . He was , despite his arduous schedule of writing , generally available in his office and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He retired at Columbia in 1924 but served as a Judge of the International Court at The Hague later . When , in some of my pieces in Newsweek , I was critical of Roosevelt 's unneutral policies in the years before Pearl Harbor , I had several long letters from Moore who was , like Beard , very critical of Roosevelt 's substantial but unofficial alliance with the Allies . Professor Dunning 's course in the history of political theories was a remarkable orientation for me , since before that I knew only a smattering of the classical political writers . He told me that he had been diverted from his research in American history by Professor Burgess , to concentrate on a history of political theories . He had already written three monumental texts on the subject . I decided that I would ask him to advise me in writing my dissertation . After some discussion in which I told him of the awakening of my interest in national politics in 1896 , he suggested that I write a history of that famous campaign . The fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources of information about Hanna and McKinley , made this seem an ideal subject . I shall tell later of why , after a year in which I gathered considerable material , I dropped the project at the suggestion of Beard and selected another topic . The next year when I told Dunning about my change of plans , he expressed considerable disappointment . He felt , I am sure , that I had chosen another subject because it would enable me to finish my graduate requirements in less time and with less work . In this he was right . I had to admit on another occasion that he was right when commenting upon a paper I submitted that I might have exhausted myself but that I certainly had not exhausted the subject . I admitted to myself that my understanding of political theory was not one of my strong points . Henry Seager was never counted among the leading men in the economics department at Columbia , nor have any of his writings merited much academic notice . But he was a truly remarkable teacher . His lectures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on labor relations were simple , beautifully organized , and free from unintelligible economic jargon . A great deal of what I said in my years in journalism about the relations of government and business came from what I learned from him . He was without cant and partisanship about the relative virtues , on the one hand , of national planning , and Brandeisian " atomism " on the other . At his recommendation I read for the first time the truly great book by President Charles R.1 Van Hise of Wisconsin , Concentration and Control . This book , which advocated Federal incorporation of interstate corporations , was , I am sure , the inspiration of Theodore Roosevelt 's ideas in his campaign in 1912 . Two junior members of the Department of Public Law with whom I had classes were Howard Lee McBain and Thomas Reed Powell , both associate professors . Powell followed the case system in teaching constitutional law . He never lectured but rather staged a sort of inquisition in which the reasoning of the Court was subjected to a searching analysis mostly of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor or student knew what he was talking about . Without a great deal of outside reading , the student in this course would get no idea of broad constitutional principles . In fact , the general drift of Powell 's reasoning seemed to be that there were no constitutional principles , or if there were ideas which people called constitutional principles , they were , in the language of Mr. Justice Holmes , " Not worth a damn . " But as the spring approached and my oral examination for the doctorate approached , I struck up a mild friendship with Powell . This gave the the idea that I would get on better with him in  | the examination if I paid less attention to my pursuit of constitutional principles and made a serious effort to study Powell 's mental processes . I did fairly well in this because in the examination my answers seemed to please him and he suggested that I take the test for what was called the Tappan prize . However , I decided not to compete . McBain had taken over the course in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Johns Hopkins . He was a Virginian who , after his graduate work at Columbia , had taught a year or two at the University of Wisconsin . He had a keen , incisive mind , but his course was not a broad survey of municipal affairs but rather an exercise in reading chapters from a book he was writing on the law of municipal home rule . So far as I could tell by observation , nobody in the class understood what he was reading or , if they did get a glimmer occasionally , they dismissed it as unimportant . He was a small man , frail and bothered by a sepulchral cough . He was a most stylish dresser and extremely punctilious in all social contacts . Student gossip had it that he and his new wife traveled in the best of social circles . He was , however , at all times available to students and was kindly and helpful with their problems . His administrative talents caught the notice of President Butler and he was destined in the year to become Head of the Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I returned to Columbia to serve on the faculty , McBain and Powell were the senior members of the department . The center of my interest at Columbia and my chief reason for becoming a student was Charles Austin Beard who reached the age of forty in November , 1914 . Perhaps a minor reason for feeling a kinship with him was the Middle Western origin which we shared . For despite his life in the East and abroad , his affections always seemed to go back to his native Indiana . His father was a prosperous farmer who had migrated from North Carolina before Charles was born . As a youth he attended a Quaker academy and after graduation enrolled in DePauw University . His chief interest outside his classes was newspaper writing . This passion for writing , acquired so early , seemed to be the reason for the truly massive volume of his literary production . After leaving DePauw , his family means enabled him to travel abroad . In 1898 he entered Oxford and during that first year he found time outside his studies to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall . He returned to the United States after a year and briefly attended Cornell University . Then , accompanied by his new wife , Mary Ritter , he returned to Europe and after a brief tour of the Continent , they settled down in England . Three years  | followed in which Beard worked to extend the influence of Ruskin Hall into the industrial population of the country . He not only lectured widely but wrote a great deal on industrial problems . The movement in which he immersed himself produced the Labor Party . In 1902 he returned to the United States and from then on for fifteen years his life was spent at Columbia . He rose rapidly in the faculty and while he was kept at the level of an associate professor for a while , he attained the title of Professor of Politics . This was in the spring of 1915 . In his book The Political and Social Thought of Charles A. Beard , Bernard C. Borning says of Beard 's writings while at Columbia : " Altogether , during this decade and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaboration with others , eleven volumes ? not to mention six book length collections of readings or documents , two revisions , numerous articles , frequent book reviews , and various other writings . " 9 One of these books , An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States , had appeared the year before I knew the author , and the reverberations were at their height when I arrived in New York . On the one side , the younger and more liberal teachers and students of American history greeted this contribution to the New History as a milestone of emancipation from the old Bancroft school of historians . Beard , by this contribution , was placed high on the list of writers who were stressing economic and social factors in the development of American institutions such as Frederick Jackson Turner . On the other hand , there were the conservative elements in New York which had their oracle in the New York Times and their intellectual leader in President Butler . Beard was arraigned as a Marxist professor who dared to portray the Founding Fathers as motivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heritage . As I look back over a perspective of more than half a century , this turmoil seems bizarre and unreal , for the march of political ideas and public understanding has made what seemed radical , even revolutionary , then , perfectly orthodox today . Students , even graduate students , are a restless lot , and there is nothing that excites them as much as the rumors that there is tension between faculty members on the one hand and the administration and the trustees on the other . And when the teacher who is suspected of being persecuted by the authorities is dynamic , attractive and popular , the partisanship of the students reaches fever pitch . The trouble in my year at Columbia must be considered in its historical setting . The so-called Progressive movement which had split the  | Republican Party and elected Woodrow Wilson in 1912 was reaching its culmination . The reverberations of Theodore Roosevelt 's feud with the Old Guard of the Republican Party were still apparent in the press and in academic life . The war in Europe fanned old conflicts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British interests . Moreover the British propaganda machine was working with great intensity to mold proAlly opinion and work toward American involvement . This was bitterly resisted , not only by pro-German elements over here but by a large body of opinion which found no American interests in the conflict and no support for our involvement . All this was soon to be complicated because of the Russian Revolution and the appearance in the United States of a body of half-hidden Communist sympathizers . The New York Times , which was regarded as generally speaking for Wall Street , was decidedly pro-British in its editorial policy . There were constant rumors that British elements were financially interested in the Times . This was not true and someone said that certainly the British need not waste their money in buying the Times for they had it anyhow . It was in the cross currents of this controversial climate that the Beard situation developed . He had been criticized in the press and in some academic circles for a variety of reasons which on examination seemed to involve a number of contradictions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oxford were alleged to have given him pro-German sympathies . His activities with the leftish elements in England were said to have associated him with Fabian socialism . And his writings on economic determination were thought to be Marxian in origin . His great attractiveness as a teacher was not all based upon his caustic humor , his flashing intelligence and his feeling for words . His physical attributes helped . His emotional nature was signalized by his reddish hair and complexion . His deep-set eyes and aquiline nose gave him a mien that suggested a crusader or , as one observer remarked , a Hebrew prophet . His posture and movements suggested an age far beyond the forty years recorded in 1914 . Hundreds of students , both undergraduate and graduate , knew him as Uncle Charley . A small group of graduate students met and talked with him quite often in that half year when he was in residence . With these favorites , he seemed deliberately to instill an element of conspiratorial overtones . We thus became comrades against all " reactionary " elements in history writing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even in religion . He once said that the way to get on in New York was to consign your mind to Nicholas Murray Butler and your soul to Bishop Manning  | ( who presided at St. John the Divine Cathedral ) . There was advice about discretion in proclaiming ideas of an unorthodox nature . He constantly advised us to look to our economic security before being too free with criticism of the existing order . And there were suggestions , which some students interpreted as " boring from within . " But there was little in these suggestions of radical change to indicate what sort of objective was to be sought . Certainly not Socialism , for Beard had never indicated any interest in the American Socialist Party . And Communism had few , if any , spokesmen on the domestic scene in those days , before the Russian Revolution . Moreover , in Beard 's discussions of economic determinism , his witnesses were Madison and certain English philosophers , never Karl Marx . But we students were swept along by the reverence we had for the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his casual exaggerations and wisecracks as serious revelation . Perhaps much of what seemed like radicalism had something of the dramatic in it and even a subtle humor ... . In that first year when I came to know Beard quite well , his interest moved beyond the recognition of the complex of interests described by Madison to the still greater complex of interests in the American society of the twentieth century . Here he made special and repeated mention of a book , which , however pertinent when it was written , is now forgotten . It was A.F. Bentley 's Process of Government . Here the author speaks of the government 's task of attempting to regulate and harmonize the vermiculate confusion of countless numbers of interests , agencies , associations , that constitute modern society . These may be allied or in conflict with each other and the individual may be a member of or allied with a great number at all times . The complexity of this association of interests makes it substantially impossible to describe now what seemed so simple when the Constitution was ratified or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , I ask the reader , as I have asked myself , whether self-interest allies me with the debtors or the creditors . While Beard 's book on the economic interpretation of the Constitution transcended anything else that he wrote in public interest and academic concern , when it appeared , in the long perspective of his thinking and writing , it is only a piece of evidence to prove his larger contention which he called the economic interpretation of history . He began writing and talking about this early in his years at Columbia . Later in 1922 he elaborated it in a book , The Economic Basis of Politics . This small book he revised and republished in 1936 and again in 1945.  | In all that he said on the subject , he seemed to be trying to make clear that while in any appraisal of a historical event or movement or personality , economic factors should be taken into consideration , his view was far from the wholly materialistic economic determinism of Karl Marx . For Beard not only pointed to the ethical and even spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of personality . In this he stands somewhere between Carlyle 's Heroes and Hero Worship and Marx . Beard from the beginning cited for support a book that had been published in 1902 by a former teacher , Professor E.R.A. Seligman . This man was not only the most distinguished member of Columbia 's economics department but a member of a renowned banking family . His view of economic determinism , with which Beard apparently fully agreed , not only took account of the economic factors which influence the course of politics but the qualifications which must be observed . This latter element is what distinguishes Beard as well as Seligman from the brutal materialism of Marx : Thus the economic interpretation of history , correctly understood , does not in the least seek to deny or minimize the importance of ethical or spiritual forces in history . It only emphasizes the domain within which the ethical forces can at any particular time act with success . . . . It endeavors only to show that in the records of the past , the moral uplift of humanity has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the ethical ideals of the community , which alone bring any lasting advance in civilization , have been erected on , and rendered possible by the solid foundation of material prosperity . 10 The character of Beard himself , kindly , patient , and helpful to his students , and burning with passionate concern for the unfortunate and deprived , is the best answer to the charge that his belief in the economic interpretation of history has anything more than a slight acquaintance with the radical materialism of Marx . So far as I knew , no student ever questioned him about his religious beliefs , if indeed he had any . We considered this to be a matter of only private concern . But in discussing Marxian materialism , he remarked with singular passion that he did not " believe this world to be a pig pen . " So far as I could see that year , Beard was almost as popular with the younger members of the faculty as he was with the students . Among the members of the Faculty of Political Science that I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second semester of that year , with Beard absent on a sabbatical leave , I seriously turned to my preparations for the oral examination required of all candidates for the doctorate . In making my plans , I carefully surveyed the ground , for it was quite unusual for a student to brave the oral examination after only one year 's residence . I went to McBain first to get his advice . After asking me a number of questions about my past preparation , he advised me to take the chance . Powell was of the same opinion , and the third faculty member whom I sought out provided me with an extraordinarily strange experience . He was a Canadian named Sait who gave the course in European governments and had the title of Assistant Professor . I had only audited his course a few times and noticed nothing unusual about him . He was a big brawny man whose demeanor was rather thoughtful and serious . I had only a slight acquaintance with him since I had not registered in his course . I saw him briefly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited me to call at his apartment . When I called on him , he seemed strangely preoccupied and after a few casual comments told me that he had recently been afflicted with a species of melancholia . He seemed to enjoy talking with someone and became quite friendly . When I left , he asked me to call again . Since he was to be one of the examiners and his specialty was British government , I made certain to reread A. Lawrence Lowell 's two volumes on the government of England . But at the examination a few weeks later , Sait , who suddenly seemed to believe that he was substituting for Beard , confined his questions to rather recent events in American political history , ignoring his own specialty of European governments . I was quite unprepared for these questions . I was embarrassed and worried about his questions and when , after the examination , I was compelled to wait a long time to receive the verdict , I was sure I had flunked on account of Sait 's behavior . Years after the examination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the room . Sait had protested against passing me because of my failure to answer his questions correctly . Powell also told me that what Sait had said about his melancholia was really a diagnosis of the quite common spell of remorse and discouragement that all alcoholics suffer after an excessive bout with the bottle . In the following year Sait was given a leave of absence which he spent in the North Woods as a laborer in a lumber camp . At the end of that year he decided to resign at Columbia . The examination , aside from Sait , was a rather pleasant and stimulating occasion . The rule is that the questioning lasts three hours with  | each participant having a fifteen-minute go at the candidate . The only questioners I remember were Moore , Dunning , Seager , McBain , Powell and Sait . I must have done quite well because everyone but Sait had favored passing me . But Powell told me later that in the discussion after the questioning when the candidate is absent , the discussion about the candidate is quite general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made upon the members of the faculty , especially the professors in his major subject of interest . The plans of the candidate are considered and the question of his probable success is weighed . So I returned to Olmsted Falls after the successful termination of the exciting and fruitful intellectual experience of my life . When I was in New York in the spring of 1916 , I talked with Beard about my dissertation . As I noted earlier , I had chosen as a subject the campaign of 1896 and during my final year at West High had made some small progress . I had collected some material and had several interviews with survivors of the great contest between Bryan and McKinley , who lived in Cleveland . But after nearly a year of this , it was apparent that to complete this task would take several years if I were to carry on with it despite the demands of a heavy teaching load . Beard agreed with this and said that since it was essential that I get the degree as soon as possible , it was advisable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year or two . He said that at the Bureau some of the staff members had already been collecting material on a notable movement in state governments designed to reorganize the framework of their administration in the interest of greater efficiency and economy . He suggested that I make a dissertation out of this material and that if I completed a report , the Bureau of Municipal Research would publish it as a report . This was a considerable inducement because a doctor 's dissertation at Columbia must be published and if no publisher were willing to assume the costs , they would fall upon the author . When the little book was finished , it was printed as a report of the Bureau and I deposited fifty copies in the Columbia Library as was required under the rules . So I made this decision and with the material at the Bureau , I began the collection of new material from the states themselves . Several of the state legislatures had created what were called efficiency and economy commissions and their reports were readily available . During my first and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report and by 1918 completed it . The Bureau published it as one of their reports , and I easily passed the one hour 's examination on the dissertation in early 1918 and received my degree that year . I have never been very proud of this  | little book because almost before it was completed , several more states had created commissions and the state of New York was working on a plan to " streamline " its state administrative machinery . The direction of this New York operation had been given over by Governor Alfred E. Smith to Robert Moses who had been a staff member of the Bureau after he had secured his degree at Columbia . I found , curiously enough , that the first person in the academic world to treat the subject of public , which means government , administration was a man who was to be the President of the United States , Woodrow Wilson . In a startlingly prescient article he called attention to the fact , which should have been obvious , that since public opinion was demanding that the government do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government machinery was getting larger and more complicated , there should be more systematic study of how government machinery could operate more efficiently and with a minimum of expense to the taxpayer .  | The Beard Resignation When I returned to New York in the spring of 1916 I found the East generally , and New York particularly , highly disturbed over American policy toward war in Europe . The Establishment , always easily identified , consisting of the press , the financial community and Columbia University , was more strongly pro-Ally than in the year before . In anticipation of American intervention , there was an outcry for greater military preparedness . Strong criticism was voiced against Wilson 's unchanged attitude of neutrality . Later that year , in the presidential campaign , the President remained adamant on the subject and derived great support from the general feeling in the Middle West that we should stay out of the conflict . The slogan was , " He kept us out of war . " There was a strong pacifist element among the students , who had the best of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrations , and several organizations dedicated to peace . Some of the demonstrations were on the Columbia campus . In one such meeting held in a school auditorium somewhere in the city , comments were made which were interpreted as defaming the flag of the United States . There followed heated appeals in the press for denying the use of school property for such gatherings . Beard , always stirred to action when freedom of speech was involved , made a statement , saying in effect that while he deplored the unpatriotic language used at the meeting , he deeply resented demands for suppressing freedom of expression . The New York Times , ever ready to attack Beard for his alleged radicalism , took this occasion for a long editorial , dragging in Beard 's famous book on the Constitution . The editorial said that it was the teaching of " such " professors which encouraged students in their radicalism . The editorial appeared shortly after I returned to Columbia , and since I found my friends among the graduate students infuriated because of the Times ' attack upon their beloved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his strong dedication to American in-  | terests . This statement was well circulated among the graduate students where it gathered many signatures . We gave it to the press . In a list of the publications about Beard in Borning 's book , it appears that such a round robin was published in the New Republic . This must have been the one I initiated . The obiter dicta in the Times ' editorial about Beard 's books represented a widespread feeling about the professor among the Columbia trustees and others , which had been current since the book was published three years before . At that time Butler had been quoted as saying that Beard was the advocate of a " notion " linked with the " crude , unhistorical and immoral teaching of Karl Marx . " 11 On this occasion in 1916 Butler strongly defended Beard in a trustees ' meeting showing them the statement from the graduate students . We had made sure that Butler had a copy . At this point in my account , I am able to reveal some information hitherto unpublished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfred Vagts , who is Beard 's only daughter , Miriam . In the process of collecting the Beard papers for future publication , she found two memoranda among her father 's papers which throw great light upon the facts which led up to the resignation . One of them says in substance that on May 1 , 1916 , Beard had been asked to appear before a trustees ' committee on education to explain his statement about the flag incident and he was able to show that the words attributed to him were without substance . However , to Beard 's surprise , a trustee , Frederick R. Coudert , insisted on comment upon Beard 's ideas about American history . Beard 's memo quoted Coudert as saying that " in his opinion the American revolution had been in fact a revolt against usurpation by a German king on the English throne . " Beard 's memo goes on to say that two other trustees ( named ) went on to make a general indictment of Beard 's ideas , saying they felt that his teachings were calculated to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , was headed , " Statement of facts in the minutes of the Committee of Education of the Board of Trustees of Columbia University and Professor Charles A. Beard . " Mrs. Vagts says that this was " certainly written by father . " 12 After this annoying interrogation before the trustees , there came another incident in which Leon Fraser was the subject of concern by the trustees . As I noted earlier , Fraser was a part-time assistant in some of Beard 's undergraduate courses . He also had another job with the Carnegie-supported Association for International Conciliation , the head of  | which was Butler with Dean Frederic C. Keppel assisting . One of Fraser 's duties was recruiting summer school teachers in behalf of peace . It seemed that in marking papers Fraser had flunked the son of one of the trustees and that the said trustee demanded that Fraser be fired . Apparently there was no inquisition before the trustees but the word went to Beard who was head of the Public Law Department not to recommend Fraser 's reappointment . Beard went to Keppel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead body at the door of the trustees " than be a party to this persecution . But later by some means the trustee in question had been able to have Fraser removed . 131 Beard 's memo does not mention the name of the trustee but tells of the aftermath : I , therefore , lodged my personal protest against ... the whole miserable affair . I then took a long walk in Riverside Park in the dead of night and made up my mind that I had to choose between the easy way of acquiescence in irregular , unjudicial , dark room methods of university administration and protest against such methods , destined to bring down on my head unpleasant notoriety and bitter criticism . I chose the latter ... . I made the decision ... . Then came the expulsion of Professor Cattell and Dana which complicated the issue , but having made the decision ... I resigned my professorship . This memorandum about how the decision was reached clears up certain misconceptions . It was the belief at the time , a belief which I entertained until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in protest against the dismissal of Cattell and Dana . Out in Cleveland I learned through the papers all about the CattellDana firing but nothing about Fraser . It was reported that a long-standing feud between Butler and Cattell had flared up and that Butler and trustees had removed not only Cattell but an instructor in English named Henry Wadsworth Longfellow Dana , a grandson of the poet . I had heard echoes of the Cattell affair the year before . Among other indignities which Cattell had heaped upon Butler was a letter written to the faculty , suggesting that since there was need for a new building to house the Faculty Club the beautiful President 's Residence should be commandeered for the Club . He added to his letter the charge that Butler had used the house " for social climbing . " In response to my question , Mrs. Vagts has cleared up another misunderstanding . In Borning 's book he says that the decision to resign was made at New Milford after consultation with Beard 's wife , Mary . The  | story around the campus had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had , she might have dissuaded him . The letter to me in January , 1973 , from Mrs. Vagts says : You ask whether CAB decided without consulting Mary . I should say , yes . He was in a high rage and never thought of consequences . He was , in fact , accustomed to making principal decisions without telling Mary . Thus he bought that big , old , gray house in New Milford on impulse , one autumn afternoon , when a real estate agent took him there for a drive . " Done , " cried father . Mother never saw it until after the whole thing was settled , and she was really downcast . It looked like a monster to her , for the place was weed grown and decayed then . There is , however , more evidence . There is an article in a Southern magazine by Mrs. Dorothy Tucker called , " Charles and Mary Beard in North Carolina " ( where the Beards spent several winters ) . She says that Mary told her that she was eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wanamakers , found one and ordered it sent home . That night she ran to the door to tell him of her surprise about the furniture . But he told of his surprise about the resignation . She then called off the purchase from Wanamakers . Beard 's letter offering his resignation permitted him to give expression to the attitude toward the Trustees which he had harbored for months and years ... . After Beard 's resignation , the New York Times published an editorial ( October 10 , 1917 ) which was a reply to Beard 's criticism of the Trustees . The tone of this editorial illustrates not only the extent of the newspaper 's partisanship in the controversy within academic circles concerning Beard 's break with tradition in his history of writing , but the extent to which antiGermar prejudice prevailed in the First World War ... . The Times , and indeed public opinion , which on that day it summoned to its side , has come a long , long way until 1972 when it was unrestrained in its opposition to a war in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say in various departments of the newspapers about the writing of history . For Beard 's version of the economic factors in politics is now taken as a matter of course . Also in the Times endorsement of Senator McGovern for President , a man who represents far more radical views than Beard entertained in his earlier years . 14 When I read about the resignation in the Cleveland newspaper , my  | emotional reaction was quite forcefully shown in the letter I wrote a day or so later . I said in part : " I know that the time has not yet come to try and measure the fine thing you have done . That it was an act of fine courage shot through with enlightenment goes without saying .... The results will be too significant to be seen now . The teaching profession , too humble and time serving in the past , will forever assume an added importance . Your great letter has given to it dignity and independence and power . " I also impulsively suggested that I had lost interest in getting a degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment had my dissertation , to hold it for a while ... . Beard 's reply was brief : " I could not take my own advice . I just had to do it . Will tell you all some day . " As I look back , the resignation of Beard was a tragic loss to academic life , for he stood foremost in American higher education in America , not only because of his brilliant scholarship but because of his inspired teaching . It seems that he might have accomplished his end by a statement denouncing the action of the Trustees without resigning , for resignation was good news for his enemies . The real gain was the effect upon the policies of the University administration , for the Cattell-Dana action was not repeated . In fact , the Trustees after that kept hands off hiring and promoting and dismissing faculty personnel . I learned this nearly twenty years later , when a trustee who was a good friend of mine came to me asking my help . He said that Fiorello LaGuardia , who was considering retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ambition to be employed at Columbia as a professor of municipal government . The Trustee wanted me to use my good offices to persuade the department , of which I was a member , to ask for LaGuardia 's appointment . I asked him why he did not consult the Chairman of the Board of Trustees about it . He said very emphatically that that approach would never do , for if it were known that the Trustees wanted the appointment , the faculty would never agree . Perhaps this great change reflected the stillliving impact of Beard 's resignation . I then said I would canvass the members of the department about the opportunity to have LaGuardia as a colleague . Their reaction was negative . They did not want LaGuardia . So I delivered this decision to the Trustee and the matter died a quiet death . After his resignation , Beard 's interest in the improvement of government administration drew him closer to the New York Bureau of Municipal Research where he had been spending some of his time for a year or so working on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Trustees of the Bureau offered him the directorship of the Bureau and he held that title for some years . In 1919 he joined several of his former colleagues , including James Harvey Robinson , Alvin Johnson , and others in establishing the New School for Social Research where he gave some lectures . As director of the Bureau he had a part in numerous projects involving government reorganization including the famous administrative reforms at Albany inspired by Governor Alfred E. Smith . In 1922 , at the invitation of Viscount Goto , Mayor of Tokyo , he visited the Far East and helped establish a Bureau of Municipal Research in Japan . The next year , after his return , he was again summoned by Goto , because of an earthquake and fire in Tokyo . He worked with Goto in the reconstruction of the city . My contacts with Beard in the 1920s were minimal but I was reminded of him constantly by the stream of articles and books which he wrote , mostly at his home in New Milford . In 1926 he was elected President of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President of the American Historical Association . With the coming of the New Deal and my involvement in the Roosevelt Administration , our contacts revived in a series of letters which continued to the end of his life . I shall deal with those contacts in another chapter . Since there has been reference in what I cited from Beard 's daughter to her father 's finances , some comment is appropriate here to that subject . There seems to be some confusion among those who have written about Beard 's personal life as to his finances . Was the severance from Columbia an economic calamity ? And was he reduced to something near the poverty line when he retired to New Milford and purchased certain farm and dairy properties which were not very productive ? On the other hand , was he secreting large means , the basis of which he gained by speculation in war stocks in the First World War ? With reference to the latter gossip , I can offer my recollection . In 1914 when he told certain of his students , including me , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market well before there was any money to be made in war stocks . Perhaps his Quakerish manner of pretending penury had something to do with the rumor that he was poor . The fact is that he was always well fixed , ever since , in his college years or before , he made a small town newspaper in Indiana pay a profit . His textbooks , those which he wrote himself and those on which he collaborated with others , sold in the millions and brought in substantial royalties . His reason for telling his small circle  | of favored students about his earlier speculations was to enforce upon us the great necessity to attain financial security before throwing dangerous opinions around . His grandfather , John Payne , was a rich farmer who founded the bank at New Castle , Indiana . And his father , William , was always well-to-do . Also when he resigned from Columbia the salary in his new job with the Bureau of Municipal Research paid well above what he got at Columbia . His passion in the years after his resignation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commenting upon this type of property . he said that in a depression one could " always eat his investment . " And when he died , he left the members of his family well provided for . In Richard Hofstadter 's study The Progressive Historians , the author gets quite confused in what he writes about Beard 's investments . What Hofstadter does make clear is that Beard and other writers of dissent in the Progressive era voicing protest against the excesses of capitalistic enterprise were not abandoning the thrifty habits of the well-to-do .  | West High to Western Reserve When I returned to Olmsted Falls that spring of 1915 after my year at Columbia , I enjoyed the profound satisfaction of having completed the most important step in the realization of my ambition to be a college teacher . I had successfully passed the difficult oral examination required of candidates for the Ph.D . In those days the doctorate was not easy to come by . To qualify for employment in college teaching at most institutions , you needed only " satisfactory " progress toward the degree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lower ranges of the faculty . The passing of the " orals " was a matter of considerable importance in the academic circles at that time , for degrees at Columbia were sparingly bestowed . A considerable majority of the graduate students who came and were registered in the graduate faculties were never encouraged to take the oral examination at all , and of those who did take it more than half were failed . The vast majority remained from one to three years and then drifted into non-academic occupations . This dropout rate was at least seventy-five per cent among the students I knew there . It was not without interest that two of my friends at Columbia did complete the requirements for the doctorate , and both were from Oberlin . Before leaving New York I had made arrangements for summer employment . President Butler was at that time President of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . Most of his duties in this office were given over to Fred Keppel , the dynamic Dean of Columbia .... A part of the program was the financing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to give courses in international relations . Dean Keppel 's assistant in recruiting suitable teachers was a very attractive graduate student of my acquaintance , . . . Leon Fraser . Fraser was as anxious to provide remunerative employment to his friends as they were to get the extra money and experience . I asked for one of the jobs and was assigned to the University of Delaware at Newark .  | The job at the University of Delaware was my introduction to college teaching . It was not a large institution at that time but its nearness to Wilmington , Washington and New York made weekend visits quite possible . I spent several days in the Library of Congress doing some preliminary work on my thesis on the Campaign of 1896 . A diversion that summer was a lively " letter to the editor " bout with a man named Vallandigham . He had seen the account of a speech I made at the University on July 4 . The general tone of the speech was pacifist for I realized that there was a growing sentiment in the East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's letter attacking me and my speech was very bellicose . I answered in the same newspaper where his letter appeared .... There was a considerable exchange ... . The resumption of my classes at West High in September and the months that followed were without incident . The work on my history of the presidential campaign of 1896 , which I had selected with Professor Dunning 's approval , occupied considerable time ... . During the Christmas holidays I attended the meeting of the Political Association in Washington largely to meet various professors in the big institutions who might be looking for a young and exceedingly ambitious college teacher . Beard was there and he told me that Allen Johnson , Professor of American History at Yale , was looking for a man to teach a course in American government which he was carrying along with his classes in history . ( Yale had no Department of Government until somewhat later . ) Johnson was taking a leave of absence to edit the Yale Chronicles of America . Beard had recommended me and he introduced me to Johnson . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching at Yale that I probably overdid the job of selling Johnson on my virtues . He listened patiently , however , and then told me to write and tell him why I felt I would be a good teacher at Yale . I did this when I returned to Cleveland and my letter must have been quite a stunning portrait of Raymond Moley ! However , it failed to stun Johnson . For he wrote a letter meaning to let me down with some tenderness . One point that he made ignited a resentment which I harbored for many years . He said that while he liked my spirit and admitted my qualifications , he believed I was not sufficiently mature for the Yale students . This I concluded then , even as I do now , was a patronizing message from the Eastern Establishment . I treasured that letter and never failed to quote from it when in later years , as something of a celebrity , I was invited to speak at Yale . I had then , and for quite a while after I was teaching at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am sure that there was along the Eastern seaboard a rather condescending attitude toward the Middle West . When I was brought to Columbia and assigned the job of building a Department of Government at Barnard College , I told the chairman of my Department of Public Law that I had had considerable success in attracting girls to my class at Western Reserve . He answered that while this was possible in Ohio , I would find the students at Barnard " more discriminating . " He added that his experience as an instructor at Wisconsin taught him that . I found , however , that the girls at Barnard were much like the ones I had at Western Reserve . I hope that this sort of conscious distinction has passed away in these more or less enlightened days . As spring approached I began to feel considerable concern about getting a teaching job in college the following year . A major consideration was my location . The news about vacancies comes from the college needing help to the big graduate schools in the East and in those days Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for aspirants to be there and " under foot " when the requests come in . So I began thinking about cutting my year at West High short by resigning and spending a month or so in New York . I wrote to Beard about this plan and he replied that while he saw a certain amount of risk for me in " casting my bread upon the waters , " he would do everything he could to help me get the first available job . An incident happened after I had Beard 's letter in that spring of 1916 which I am sure stiffened my determination to make the gamble . One rainy day in April I had some occasion to visit the Public Library in downtown Cleveland . On my way out I noticed ahead of me a man whom I knew . He was the civics teacher at one of the high schools and the debating team he coached had roundly walloped my boys from West High . He must have been about sixty years of age and had been a respected figure at his school for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was legendary . There he was that dismal rainy day , clad in an ancient raincoat and flappy overshoes , carrying a load of books under his arm wrapped in an old rubber bag . While thus engaged I kept telling myself , " There but for a bit of daring goes Raymond Moley twenty years from now . " I truly believe that this was the final determining factor behind my resignation . In a day or so I told Dave Simpson of my decision . He was very sympathetic , for he knew from his experience that the longer a man remained in high school teaching , the more difficult it would be to move into higher education . His educational endowment would have graced any  | university if he had moved in that direction when he was younger . So in the middle of April , I left West High and sought my fortune in New York . It was interesting that this quest for a college job ultimately brought me back to Cleveland . Professor Garner of the University of Illinois and I had a considerable correspondence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity fell through because of budgetary troubles . A few days after my arrival in New York , Beard had a letter from President Penrose in Whitman College in Walla Walla , Washington . There was need of a man to teach political science there at a salary of $1500 a year , which was considerably more than I was receiving at West High . It was an excellent institution and I learned a great deal about it from a classmate at Columbia . This man was Paul Garrett , then a recent graduate at Whitman and subsequently a Vice President of General Motors . It is interesting to note that if I had gone to Whitman , I would have had as a student William O. Douglas who entered as a freshman in 1916 and graduated in 1920 . I later served briefly with him on the Columbia Law faculty . About the same time , an inquiry came from Scott Nearing , Dean at the University of Toledo . Nearing , a well known man in those years , had been fired from the University of Pennsylvania because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radical views . He had been invited to Toledo , a town which in those years had a really radical city government . I made a trip to Toledo to survey the opportunity and was cordially received and entertained by Nearing . Apparently he considered me radical enough because Beard had recommended me . I was offered the Professorship of History , also at $ 1500 . But a subsequent opportunity to go to Cleveland caused me to reject the Toledo offer and to obtain my withdrawal from the Whitman position . In late May , when I was about to return to Ohio , Beard had a letter from August R. Hatton , which was most interesting to me . Hatton was the head of the Political Science Department at Western Reserve University in Cleveland . The department which he headed had been heavily endowed by Dan Hanna , son of the great Mark , Senator from Ohio , and the dominant figure in the GOP during the McKinley years and after . He was in addition a very rich man because of his interests in the iron ore business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was named for M.A. Hanna and the department was a memorial to him . Ironically , Hatton was a Theodore Roosevelt Progressive with ideas which would have horrified Hanna . The endowment provided for two instructors and considerable library facilities .  | When I reached Cleveland I saw Hatton and he seemed receptive to my application . The letter from Beard and a conversation he had with Simpson at West High settled the matter , and I was employed at $1200 a year . Hatton later told me that Simpson spoke very highly of my teaching ability . He said that my students used the library more than any others in the school . I wish to add with some hesitation that in this matter of teaching ability , I was always a real success . I never hesitated to claim this as my most important talent . It was the result of my long experience in various sorts of classrooms in my Olmsted Falls days . Thus the transition from high school to college , from West 65th Street to East 107th Street , was one of the great turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . encouraged me to get into public affairs . He was always dabbling into city problems and had already made a considerable name for himself as a liberal . My transition illustrated a point which in these recent years of college and university unrest I have made the subject of various written articles and one commencement address . One of the great defects in the administration of higher education has been the neglect of teaching . This seems ironical since the fundamental reason for colleges and universities had always professed to be to impart knowledge to a new generation . Research and other scholarly pursuits which used to be the ancillary factors in education seem to have usurped first priority . Administrators attract men and women of superior talent by offering them light assignments of teaching and much time for research and writing . Promotions are seldom based upon superior teaching ability , but on getting some kind of contribution , however unimportant , in print . The rule is " publish or perish . " At Columbia , due to a reorganization that took place in the years between my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system by which teachers , after a few years in one of the undergraduate colleges and the writing of a " contribution " to knowledge , were " promoted " to one of the graduate faculties with a very light schedule of one lecture and one seminar a week with exclusive contact with graduate students . This change , I have always maintained , marked the beginning of the deterioration of Columbia as a center for the training of future faculties . What happened was a lessening , not an increase , in faculty productivity . When I was a student there in the year 1914-15 , the really renowned faculty members who did so much to establish the University 's reputation combined their writing with teaching undergraduates as well as graduates . They sought no relief from teaching and they produced more lasting written work than after the change . Beard himself had undergraduate  | classes and apparently derived much inspiration from the younger students . Meanwhile , under the new dispensation in our universities , the undergraduates are taught by inexperienced young people whose only qualification has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no instruction at all in our graduate curricula in the art of teaching . As a consequence , undergraduates , herded into classes which sometimes number in the hundreds , listen to boring lectures from green instructors . It is no wonder that , lacking any excitement or inspiration in their classes , students seek excitement in the streets . My remedy for this in the 1960s , when there was a great need for college teachers , was to propose recruiting the best teachers from the high schools . It was quite unfair , I contended , to have a wall erected between the high school and the college through which the high school teacher might never be promoted ... . While in New York , I again arranged with Leon Fraser for summer teaching in 1916 . He assigned me to Wooster College . This liberal arts college , about forty-five miles south of Cleveland , was a first-rate institution . One of its distinctions was the fact that it produced the famous Compton family . The father , Elias , was Dean for many years . His three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduates of Wooster and two of them taught there for short periods . Arthur and Karl became most distinguished scientists and William an economist . All three were distinguished educators . When I went there to serve in the summer school , the contrast between what went on in the summer and the regular sessions in the rest of the year was almost unbelievable . The head and promoter of the summer session , whose name was Dickinson , was a folksy product of rural Ohio , who was regarded with a mixture of amusement and dismay by the winter faculty . He had been a perennial candidate for Governor on the Prohibition ticket . His managerial methods were something like those of a wandering evangelist . I noted when I first visited his office that the immense flood of letters he received daily were not filed . They were left in the envelopes and piled high on his desk or spilled over on the floor . The assemblies at noon had the fevered atmosphere of a camp meeting . But he was immensely popular with the rural school teachers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no standards in the courses given that I was able to discover . Everybody had a good time and everybody passed . Despite the horror of the fine and discriminating members of the regular faculty , the Treasurer  | of the college kept tongue in cheek as he toted up the tuition money that flowed in from Dickenson 's show . A serious decision had been made for marriage after summer school . The bride was Eva Dail whom I had known since school days in Olmsted Falls , and whom I had courted for years . We were married in Oberlin by Henry Churchill King , president of the college . During our remaining years in Cleveland we lived in an apartment near Western Reserve . The teaching schedule at Western Reserve which Hatton assigned to me consisted of courses in American government at both Adelbert College and the College for Women ( now named Mather College ) . Hatton specialized in municipal government and gave two or three advanced courses . He was an extremely articulate individual whose views completely suited the Progressive trend of those years . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period when reform , especially in Cleveland , touched every aspect of the democratic process and swept every rational doubt before it . The remedies which most interested Hatton were the city manager plan , proportional representation , the initiative and referendum for state affairs , and public ownership of public utilities . Except for the more measured but quite liberal philosophy I had developed under the ministration of the faculty at Columbia , I am sure that I would have been swept along the Progressive path with Hatton . But a sense of discrimination , which I shall describe later , restrained me . I did , however , participate with Hatton in introducing the Hare system of proportional representation in the small city of Ashtabula , and I helped the election commissioners count the votes . I had an opportunity to discover the practical defects in proportional representation in 1923 , my first year at Columbia . Cleveland had adopted the system by that time and considerable interest was manifested in this trial in a large city . So I visited Cleveland , determined to study the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an article in the Political Science Quarterly in December , 1923 were mostly negative . The system failed , for the same reason that so many of the Progressive political reforms failed . They assumed too much knowledge , intelligence and discrimination in the electorate . Since the system places before the voter a longish list of names , it is highly improbable that more than a small minority of the voters will know anything about the candidates . Hence it was shown that the selections of the voters were based upon the most capricious and irrevelant reasons . The Irish voter would vote for all the micks and the 0 's . The Slav would select the skis , and the other slavic names , etc . The cream of the jest in that election was an overwhelming  | vote for a man named Sultzman . This man was a cigar maker and his name had been blazoned over his district for years on cigar boxes . Because of this failure of the voters to know the candidates , the system , in the brief experience it had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to elect a disproportionate number of Communist candidates . They accomplished this by having their voters concentrate upon a small number of Communist candidates to the exclusion of all others . Also , in the distribution of the ballots of the candidates who were counted , the second and third and other choices counted just as much as first-choice vote given the winners . All this , which was so easy to see in an actual test , the promoters of the plan never anticipated . Later in 1921 Hatton and other reformers carried a vote authorizing the writing of a new city charter . In the commission elected to write this charter Hatton won election along with several other reformers . In the writing of the charter Hatton was able to incorporate in the revision the city manager plan and proportional election . This practically destroyed the old political parties , but after a very few years the charter was rewritten and the old system restored . At the time that I joined the Western Reserve faculty , Cleveland was using still another scheme of the reformers in the election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " preferential voting . " The ballots presented to the voters listed all the candidates for an office without party designation . Following these names were three spaces for three choices , first , second and third . The conscientious voter ( always an assumption of the Progressives ) would put his x before his first choice , another x before his second choice , and so on . Then , in counting the votes , if a candidate failed to get a majority , the second and third choices were added to his first choices . Finally the election went to the candidate who had the most votes . When I explained this to my class at the College for Women , a particularly dumb girl said , " But this means that the second and third choices count just as much as the first choices . " It was the case of the dog , the child , and the emperor with no clothes . Finally the voters got the point and the system was repealed . In the spring of 1917 three things happened at Reserve which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson 's call for a declaration of war . First , Hatton suffered a heart attack , mild but severe enough to confine him to his home . The other instructor in the department took over Hatton 's class in municipal government and I carried his class in constitutional law . While he was confined , he was offered and accepted a job for the next  | year with two national organizations to become a traveling exponent of the city manager plan and proportional representation . He assumed , quite correctly it proved , that his health would permit this responsibility . Hodges , in a dispute about salary , decided to quit and return to Philadelphia where he entered business . Thus , suddenly I found myself , who had been the third man in the M.A. Hanna Department , the only survivor . In granting Hatton his leave of absence , the faculty had designated the Professor of Sociology as the executive head of the political science department . In consultation with this professor , I brought into the department , to replace Hodges , a friend I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a congenial colleague . I readjusted my teaching schedule for the next year and prepared to serve as the de facto head of the department . The added responsibility was recognized in an increase in my salary from $1200 to $1600 . They paid me $100 for carrying Hatton 's class for the remainder of the term . During my first year at Western Reserve , I enjoyed many visits with my friend , Judge Manuel Levine . At the election in November , 1916 , he had won a judgeship on the Common Pleas Court , a court of general jurisdiction superior to the Municipal Court . He almost immediately interested himself in applying his conciliation idea to the divorce cases coming before the court . After several discussions with him , in which he cited many instances in which the good offices of the judge had resulted in reconciling the parties to the proposed suit , I prepared an article to be jointly signed which we called " Conciliation in Divorce . " After several instances to illustrate how conciliation had worked in Levine 's experience , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisdictions to review without lawyers all applications for divorce . I sent the article to the New Republic and it was accepted and published . The bureau that Levine proposed was created in the Common Pleas Court and so far as I know is still functioning . I had often discussed with Levine my still-active desire ultimately to become directly active in politics , perhaps as a candidate for elective office . He suggested running for the state legislature and said that while the lower house was a large body , it was possible for an intelligent and aggressive member to exercise a good deal of influence and enough public notice to win promotion to the Senate or Congress . For the moment I was receptive and Levine spoke with Burr Gongwer , the Chairman of the local Democratic organization and a power in Cuyahoga County . Gongwer had his political apprenticeship as Secretary to Mayor Johnson . He told Levine  | that he would put me on the slate of candidates from the County . This was wholly on Levine 's recommendation . I had no direct contact with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was assured . This presented me with another serious decision . Attractive as the opportunity seemed , it involved getting leave from my duties at the University very soon after I had joined the faculty . While the Legislature held only biennial sessions , these absences would be difficult to get and if insisted upon would probably endanger my career as a teacher . So I decided to decline the offer , a decision which ended my dream about seeking elective office .  | War and Americanization Leon Fraser had arranged a summer job for me in 1917 as he had in the two years before . It was decreed that I should return to Wooster . We moved down there , expecting to spend a pleasant summer when after about two weeks I received an urgent call from Judge Levine asking me to return to Cleveland . He said that the Mayor 's War Board had decided upon an important activity called Americanization and that he had suggested that I be employed to do some work of an educational nature . I knew something of the special problems which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had discussed it on several occasions , so I arranged for a substitute to take my classes at Wooster and returned to Cleveland . A bit of background is relevant , because the work to which Levine had summoned me was to occupy a considerable part of my time for more than two years . In the first months after our declaration of war , a number of states had created " councils of defense " designed to promote and carry on warrelated work on the home front . Some of their activities had been prescribed and directed from Washington , but generally states created their own programs . Some of these had to do with propaganda designed to inform the public concerning the objectives of the war as defined by the President . Measures of social welfare made necessary by the drafting of so many of the men , cooperation with Herbert Hoover 's food administration , team work in the big bond selling drives , and in Ohio especially measures to expedite the naturalization of the many thousands of foreign-born industrial workers . In Cleveland this work was carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's War Board , a group of prominent citizens appointed by Mayor Harry Davis , and provided with a considerable budget . One aspect of the work of the War Board was what was called Americanization . At that time it was estimated that some seventy per cent of the adult  | population of the city was foreign born . The men were largely employed in the city 's industries , and their loyalty and cooperation was essential to the efficiency of the war effort . As Levine and others interpreted the problem , it meant also the peace of mind of so many of these men whose native countries were locked in the mortal struggle in Europe where many of their relatives were located . Many thousands of these men were relative newcomers , for the last of the great waves of immigration was only a few years back . Many were quite unable to speak and write English , and few had taken even the first step toward naturalization . There were Hungarians , most of the Slavic nationalities , Czechs , Serbians , Poles , Lithuanians , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , had been most proud of its " social conscience . " Quite generally the community welcomed these people since their skills and their many cultures meant so much to its industries and cultural life . There was little disposition , except among a few benighted extremist native Americans , to regard these immigrants as threats to the social order . Their loyalty was taken for granted since they had come to America for what they failed to realize at home . The concern of Americans like Levine was that the immigrants be helped to understand American institutions and the reason for our participation in the war , to expedite their learning of the language and their acquisition of American citizenship . This was the problem as I first saw it . After several months of contacts with the newcomers , I realized that there were much more and more complex elements in their adjustment to our society . It was quite understandable that these members of so many nationalities had gathered each in their little compound in the city , like little Italy in the East End , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magyars or Hungarians in the southeast . This creation of national communities was as natural as the huddling of the Irish on the west side many years before . The Americanization Committee was headed by a prominent lawyer named Harold Clark and in the year that followed my contacts with him were almost continuous . Later when the war seemed to be winding down , he asked to be relieved and I was selected as his successor . Through politics and long experience in the courts , Levine had the qualities which made him the most imaginative and constructive member of the Committee . The program , which he presented and the Committee adopted , consisted of three parts : many classes for adults in the school system for teaching English ; special classes either in the school system or directly under the auspices of the Committee to teach the rudiments of  | American government which was required of applicants for citizenship ; and the creation of a bureau or center where immigrants and others could come and get legal advice of all kinds . My first assignment was to prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For this I was paid a reasonable fee . Then there was the organization of classes where my text could be used by applicants for citizenship . At first these were exclusively created by the Committee and were held in schools and branch libraries . Teachers for these classes were either from the public schools or the library staffs or lawyers . All were chosen because of their special knowledge of the language of the class to which they were assigned . To supervise these classes and to direct the work of what we called the Citizens ' Bureau , I recruited a brilliant high school teacher who was a member of the bar , George Green . He spent the rest of his life in this service . In the fifteen years that followed there were many editions of my little Lessons in Citizenship . There were not only editions for use in Cleveland but for other cities in Northern Ohio , each written to include a description of the government of the city concerned . After the Armistice , when the Americanization Committee ceased to function , Green and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of printing the book . The total number printed and distributed over the years must have been considerably more than 100,000 . The Ohio Council of Defense took note of our Americanization work in Cleveland and in 1918 I was made Director of Americanization for the state . This made necessary many trips to Columbus to direct an office there , and special visits to the cities over the state for consultation with educational officials . The teaching of English for adults was made a major activity in the public schools over the state and in certain large industries . In Ohio , Armco and Goodrich ... did distinctive work with their employees . When I was in Columbus my office was in the State House where James M. Cox sat as Governor . Since he decided to run for reelection in 1918 as the great war Governor , he announced that his speeches would be wholly non-political . To assist him in shaping certain speeches on the war settlement in Europe and , incidentally , to get the votes in the cities of Ohio of the many natives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlisted my assistance in learning what and where these countries were . To facilitate this early " brain trusting " of mine , I set up in his office a large map of Europe and from that instructed him to distinguish between the Yugoslays and the Czechoslovaks , etc . He had a quick but superficial mind and I never had much respect for his truthfulness or his statesmanship.  | When it came to voting in 1920 when he ran against Harding , I decided to skip the candidates for President . In 1918 I undertook another responsibility . A friend , Allen Burns , who had served for a few years in an official capacity with the Cleveland Foundation , had resigned the year before and with a grant from the Carnegie Foundation was directing a big survey of the problems of the immigrant population and publishing the findings in several volumes entitled Americanization Studies . Burns , who was familiar with the problems of Cleveland and with the work of our Americanization Committee , asked me to join his staff . I contributed several chapters for one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans by Choice . I also contributed a chapter to another study , Schooling for the Immigrant . This dealt with citizenship classes . These volumes were published after 1920 . This job not only provided some additional revenue to our household , but the publication of my contributions was an asset in my academic record . The reader of this account may be inclined to wonder how with all these extramural activities , I was able to care for my responsibilities at Western Reserve . By a concentration of my classes in three days of the week , I was able to have considerable free time and judged by the enrollment , my teaching was popular with the students . In 1917 and 1918 the student body at Adelbert , the men 's college , was considerably reduced by the draft and enlistments . But my classes there showed a substantial rise . At the College for Women , the first class I had numbered only about eighteen . In the second and third year this class grew to about 100 . In 1918 I secured my promotion to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hatton , one day when he paused in Cleveland to rest from his travels , from a man he knew at the University of Kansas and whom I had met at a meeting of the Political Science Association . His name was Clarence Dykstra . He was quite articulate . With his excellent academic record and engaging personality , he seemed to be destined for something more important than his position at the Kansas institution . Dykstra thought so too and his letter to Hatton said he was most anxious to get out of his present location and get located in something more exciting . Hatton and I were members of a reform organization in Cleveland called the Civic League , an organization whose purpose was to keep a sharp watch on community affairs , particularly the city government . The secretary of this organization had recently resigned and it was easy for Hatton to get the job for Dykstra . When the appointment was concluded , Dykstra , perhaps as a reward , sent me a  | telegram offering me his job in Kansas . This was a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had at Reserve . But I was unwilling to leave Cleveland . However , the offer gave me the very tool which academic people used in those days to demand promotion . I made an engagement with the president of Reserve and boldly laid the telegram on his desk . Apparently he was quite familiar with this sort of pressure and he simply held his arms in the air and said , " What do you want ? " I told him that I wanted something that would not cost him any money , my promotion to the rank of Assistant Professor . " Oh , " he said , " that 's just the stroke of a pen . " Such promotions at Reserve at that time must be approved by what was known as the " Permanent Officers , " which consisted of the President , the Dean and the full professors . Since they recognized that there was something incongruous in a man with the title of Instructor operating a department with its real head away , I was duly confirmed as an Assistant Professor . Dykstra 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notable career . He went from Cleveland to the Secretaryship of the City Club of Chicago , and from there to Cincinnati as City Manager . Thereafter , he was President of the University of Wisconsin and Chancellor of the University of California at Los Angeles . 15 During the spring and early summer of 1918 the war seemed to be taking a turn for the worse and this might seriously lengthen the duration of the war . I was barely within the age limits of the draft , so I wrote to my old doctors , Peters and Sewall , asking for letters regarding my health record . They both replied saying that despite seven years of freedom from a recurrence of TB , my history made me a bad risk . I presented these letters to my draft board and received a classification substantially exempting me from service . After the Armistice , the Mayor 's War Board began the business of terminating its activities . As Chairman of the Americanization Committee , I asked the Board to let us continue our work with the foreign born . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Some of this we used to continue the work of the Citizen 's Bureau , and some went to the preparation and publishing of a series of booklets on the various nationalities in Cleveland , stressing their history , characteristics , and especially their contributions to the life and culture of the city . During the following winter I felt that something in the nature of a text in citizenship was needed which combined simple English with information about American history and government . I enlisted as co-author an ex-  | tremely gifted teacher in the classics , Huldah Cook . The book was published by Macmillan and was called Lessons in Democracy . The book was used for a while in the school system but in the following year , a member of the School Board whose printing business had been injured by labor troubles attacked our book because he said it was too pro-labor . The Board threw it out when Miss Cook and I refused to amend the text . The war and the various civil activities which were continuous after the war had taken a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was especially notable in such subjects as political science and economics . Perhaps that was a major reason why I fared so well in the war years and after . With the war over , the budgets of higher institutions were loosening up and a considerable number of vacancies were appearing . In the spring of 1919 the president of the University of Minnesota , Marion LeRoy Burton , invited me to dinner at his hotel and offered me an Associate Professorship at a salary nearly twice what I was getting at Reserve . My duties would include some teaching , but mainly the development of a government research bureau where I would work closely with the legislature in St. Paul . Without asking for time to weigh this attractive offer , I accepted then and there . After the appointment had been confirmed , I resigned at Reserve and began making plans to move to Minneapolis . I had serious regrets about leaving Cleveland but the promotion in rank , the larger salary , the larger institution and the quite remarkable opportunity to work with the government were conclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more serious reasons for my regret at leaving Cleveland , and the ultimate reason why after a time I changed my mind and decided to stay , was my interest in the lively and colorful population of Cleveland . It is true that other midwestern cities had mixtures in their population similar to those in Cleveland , cities like Chicago , Pittsburgh and Buffalo . But none of these had the enlightenment over the twenty years since Johnson which made possible an attitude toward Americanization which distinguished our work . It is true that a great many Americans , and some of them lived in Cleveland , understood Americanization to mean a quick job of transforming these " foreigners " into people who would be indistinguishable from native Americans , same language , same citizenship , same dress and habits of living . This pattern of assimilation would have been undesirable , even if possible , for there were just too many immigrants and their national character was too deep-seated for sudden change .  | The task of Americanization as it came to be understood in Cleveland was to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship in life the two elements in the population , the highly enlightened and sophisticated portion of the native population , and the great mass of unassimilated and partly assimilated foreign born , the new and the old in one community which was greatly enriched by what the immigrants brought to its culture because of their diversity . This meant amalgamation rather than mere assimilation . To be sure , the creation of better communication between the new and the old meant the stepping up of efficient means of teaching English and for giving aliens the means of attaining American citizenship . But beyond that there were immensely serious problems of adjustment . These newcomers needed help in solving the legal problems they encountered in their daily lives ; those who had relatives abroad , sometimes their immediate families , needed help after the Armistice in establishing communication . There were problems of establishing closer contact with their employers , their fellow workers and the labor unions . Their financial affairs often created problems in which they needed help . And it was immensely important to create machinery either in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploiters with which they were surrounded , often members of their own nationalities . All these matters came within the term Americanization . A great part of my efforts in Cleveland and as an officer of the Ohio Council of Defense , both during and after the war , was to get these considerations over to the people through the spoken and the printed word . This meant many speeches over the state , especially in the industrial centers , and the publication of literature designed to inform both native and foreign born . It is difficult for this generation to comprehend the immense problem created more than half a century ago when the onset of the war and the great flood of immigration came as it seemed all at once , for in the years since the children and grandchildren of those immigrants have moved up the ladder to important positions in tho political , economic , and cultural life of the cities . In political life this new influence is most easily seen in the names of those who hold high office in all branches of the government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mayor of Cleveland , Governor of Ohio , and United States Senator . He was born of immigrants from Yugoslavia . These immigrants lived out their lives , mastered the difficulties with which they were surrounded , and raised their families to grace the city of  | their choice . It might not be inappropirate when we toast the early settlers who came from England , Germany , Scandinavia and Ireland to bear in mind these immigrants of the years before 1920 who in the industries of our great cities faced vicissitudes just as formidable as the wilderness and the Indians .  | The Cleveland Foundation A decent gesture of modesty requires me to offer an exception to the cliche that wars profit no one . The exigencies of the war effort in Cleveland had already rescued me from summer school teaching in Wooster and gave me profitable work in the Americanization movement . My participation in this patriotic undertaking brought to me a prominence in Cleveland in a very few months that I might not have attained in ten years of teaching the boys and girls at Western Reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minnesota offer with the war , but it was no doubt the heavy manpower demands for war work that thinned the ranks of eligible men of my age and education and put me high among the eligibles for the vacancy offered . So many in my age range were drawn into the vast emergency in Washington that for a few golden months the market for college teachers turned in favor of qualified men . And it was surely the prominence of the work I was doing that brought me sharply to the notice of Belle Sherwin , to whom I was indebted for my employment by the Cleveland Foundation . In several respects that institution was unique . It was the creation of Fred Goff , whom we met earlier when he was selected by the Cleveland street railway interests as their representative in final negotiations with Mayor Johnson . Shortly after the creation of the Tayler compromise , he was induced to leave the practice of law to become President of the Cleveland Trust Company . As he settled into the duties of a bank executive , his earlier reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , regulations and prejudices that limit a bank 's legal work , a number of elderly men of property continued to consult Goff about the ultimate disposal of their property . In these consultations he noted a lack of constructive ideas of many testators when , after providing reasonably for their families , they had surplus wealth to dispose of . Goff 's reflections on this were sharpened when he read a notable book , The Dead Hand , by an Englishman , Sir  | Arthur Hobhouse . This book , in which Goff made many penciled notes , told of the many capricious bequests in England which were not only unwise and wasteful but , as they stood over the years , positively against the public interest . One passage which Goff heavily underlined was this : The grip of the dead hand shall be shaken off absolutely and finally ; in other words , there shall always be a living and reasonable owner of property , to manage it according to the wants of mankind . This again must be a public tribunal charged with the duty of adjusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless . Goff 's thinking went far beyond Hobhouse in that he sought a means by which the ultimate disposition of surplus property should be made by some living agency attuned to the needs of the present . He wanted the property to return to the benefit of the community in which the wealth was created and which was responsible for it . Perhaps this was a version of the philosophy of Henry George as expounded by Tom L. Johnson . The device created by Goff for eliminating the " dead hand " by providing a living agency with discretion to dispose of the residual wealth was the use of the foundation idea . In his law practice , Goff had enjoyed considerable familiarity with the foundations which played so large a role in spending Rockefeller 's money . But , as he told me on one occasion , he had never agreed with the Rockefeller plan of self-perpetuating boards . Therefore , in setting up his foundation he provided that a majority of the members of the Committee should be appointed for rather short terms by public officials ; one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge of the district , including Cleveland , and one by the probate judge of the county . The two remaining members of the Board were to be appointed by the Cleveland Trust Company . Thus there was assurance of adequate representation of the public interest and also sound management of the funds by the bank acting as a trustee . The stated purpose was made very general but so stated as to assure tax exemption , and the grants and operations of the Foundation were limited to the City of Cleveland . 17 Since in the early years of the Cleveland Foundation the income would be relatively small , Goff suggested that the Committee should begin by conducting surveys of certain social problems in the city which might serve as its guide in distributing larger sums later . In short , the Foundation sought in these surveys to acquaint itself as well as the Cleveland public with information about the city , its institutions and its needs . To finance  | these , Goff himself , as well as certain friends , contributed the funds necessary for operations . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had enjoyed considerable experience in social and civic affairs in Pittsburgh and Chicago . The first survey conducted by the Foundation was about public welfare . To conduct this study Burns brought to Cleveland Sherman Kingsley , who had been a prominent social welfare worker in Chicago . This study recommended the creation of a Cleveland Community Fund . This included an annual drive to raise funds for all social welfare agencies of all religious groups . The funds collected went into a fund which was distributed by what was known as The Welfare Federation . Kingsley was the first director of this super agency . Provision was made for donors to have the right to specify , if they so chose , the particular agency to which the donation should go . But so far as possible the public was encouraged not to put strings on the gifts . Thus the Foundation , which itself was a new and unique institution , had brought into being another which was widely adopted over the nation . These have various names but the distinctive feature copied from Cleveland was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Foundation 's next survey was a comprehensive examination of the public school system and of the education problems which faced the school administration . To direct this , the Foundation employed Leonard Ayers , a specialist in education and statistics with the Russell Sage Foundation . The reports of this survey were printed in twenty-five small volumes and were mostly presented in public meetings . These reports were mostly critical of the schools . Perhaps as a result of the stir created by the survey , a new Superintendent was brought to Cleveland and under his direction there was a general shaking up of the personnel of the system . Greatly encouraged by the success of the education survey , the Foundation in 1916 decided upon a survey of recreation in Cleveland . This was placed under the direct supervision of Burns . He associated with himself as a technical advisor Rowland Haynes , a social worker from Chicago . The work of the various divisions was well along when in early 1917 there came a clash of personalities which threatened the Foundation 's explorations into the city 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the survey called commercial recreation was an investigation of prostitution . Burns , who would probably call himself an independent liberal , was apparently seeking to show a  | connection between prostitution and official , mostly police , corruption . Now , more than sixty years later , we may with impunity enjoy the hilarious comedy that shook the special welfare structure of Cleveland and lost to the city a most colorful leader , and also paralyzed the Foundation . Picture the enemies of vice , the well known pastor of a large fashionable Euclid Avenue Church , and a nationally famous leader in social welfare affairs . Both , rather portly middle-aged men , hawking about , snooping into the affairs of assorted bawds to see if they were in any way associated with city policemen . Real cloak and dagger stuff ! I am not sure that the amateur operatives used ladders to give them visual access to what was going on in houses of ill repute ( as happened in a similar case later ) , but apparently they saw and heard enough to prompt Burns to issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city which it governed to go down the primrose path to a haven for vice and petty corruption . It must be noted that this came soon after the big survey of the schools which had received high public approval . And when Burns embellished the story of public licentiousness as having been uncovered by the Cleveland Foundation , the story rated front-page news . I have always had a critical word for reformers because of their lack of a sense of humor . As proof , this episode of the two do-gooders and the irate banker rates high . But at the moment nobody in Cleveland thought the episode was funny . After Burns had made public some of the gleanings which he and the preacher had discovered , together with some critical remarks about the city administration , Goff immediately reacted by denouncing Burns for prematurely revealing the findings of a Foundation survey before the complete reports were officially issued . Burns , incensed by this reprimand , resigned and left the city . Perhaps the impulse to defend the Mayor came from Goff 's outrage at the misuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liking for Mayor Harry L. Davis who had been elected as a Republican in 1916 , ending the fifteen years known as the Johnson era. 18 At the time that the Goff-Burns tiff appeared in the newspapers , I could not have been more neutral . I knew Burns slightly . Goff I knew only as I read of him in the press . Indeed the affair was of only slight interest to me and I did not then or later feel any partisanship . I knew Belle Sherwin through other connections and only later as a member of the Cleveland Foundation Committee . When , because of my interest in the Foundation , I came to a better understanding of the facts behind the quarrel , I was still neutral . I  | disapproved of the action of Burns which , in my judgment , was a violation of the proper procedure in conducting a survey . And I also felt that Goff had been unnecessarily aroused about a matter that should have been handled privately , perhaps with a conference with the Mayor . Four members of the Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Cleveland Trust Company , supported Burns after the outbreak . They resented Goff 's interference with the survey which was properly the exclusive concern of the Committee . The Committee , after the departure of Burns , discontinued the survey , locked up the partially completed reports , and suspended all operations . They gave the Declaration of War as an excuse for the suspension which was regarded as a valid reason for dropping the subject of recreation . For it would have appeared foolish to be concerned with how the people were spending their spare time when the war effort demanded full employment and full activity . In the spring of 1919 when the city and country were returning to peacetime pursuits , a colleague of mine at Reserve , an instructor in sociology , came to me and proposed that I approach the Foundation Committee and suggest that the recreation survey should be rescued from the dust and completed ; also that the men to perform this salvage operation should be Moley and Coulter . The idea appealed to me for several reasons . A chief one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advantage to both of us through the academic credit it would bring . The members of the Committee , appointed by various public officials , were Thomas Fitzsimmons , a liberally inclined retired steel manufacturer , and Malcolm McBride , who had inherited from his father a large wholesale drygoods business . He was also a famous Yale football star of a few years before . The third public member was a formidable figure , Belle Sherwin , daughter of one of Cleveland 's pioneer industrialists who founded the Sherwin-Williams Paint Company . She had given her life to social service and was , through her dominating character and her prominence in Cleveland 's social life , easily the strongest member of the Foundation Committee . I had some acquaintance with her because of a speech I had made at her request at a Columbus meeting of social workers . One appointee of the Cleveland Trust Company was Dr. James L. Williamson , a venerable and respected figure in Cleveland who had been pastor of the leading Presbyterian Church for many years . Since his retirement from the ministry he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Savings Bank . Despite his banking con-  | nections and his appointment by the Trust Company , he had gone along with the majority in suspending the operations of the Foundation after the Goff-Burns affair . The Foundation 's Counsel was James R. Garfield , son of President Garfield , and a close friend and Secretary of the Interior under Theodore Roosevelt . He was a powerful name in Cleveland . As I appraised the situation , it was Miss Sherwin with whom I should conduct negotiations . I have often said that no speech of mine , except those delivered by someone else , ever did any good for anyone . But the one I had delivered in Columbus not only won me the most important job I had ever held , but in a very important way influenced my whole career . I had prepared it with great care . It was an appraisal of what the war had taught about the importance of a strong Federal establishment , of a wider consideration of social objectives in the plans of governments , and the necessity that governments exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also called attention to the rising power of unions and the benefits which this might bring to management , the workers , and the public . Toward the end of this speech , I quoted something from a recent manifesto of the British Labor Party . Apparently the sentiments I expressed found a most sympathetic listener in Miss Sherwin . She was quite liberal in her political and economic views and in later years , when she was National President of the League of Women Voters , she was something of a maverick in her class . She listened to my plan for reviving the recreation survey and for reactivating the Foundation . She said she would talk with the other members of the Committee . As a result the Committee at a meeting decided to become active and to employ me to direct the completion of the recreation survey . My situation in this revival of the Foundation 's activities called for great tact on my part in dealing with Goff , for the Committee had acted without consulting him . But his cooperation was most essential as the resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed upon him to find the money for the survey . I immediately had an interview with Goff at which I was accompanied by dear old Dr. Williamson . Since Williamson had been appointed by the Cleveland Trust Company and enjoyed such moral stature in the community , his presence as my sponsor did much to dissipate old differences . However , Goff had every reason for seeing the Foundation reactivated . It was his baby and its future depended upon its acceptance as a going concern by the community and especially by potential contributors .  | When I examined the material in the files , I found that the survey had been planned to have six reports , each written by an appropriate specialist . The titles of the reports were : Delinquency and Spare Time ; School Work and Spare Time ; Wholesome Citizens and Spare Time ; The Sphere of Private Agencies ; Public Provision for Recreation ; and Commercial Recreation . I found that the first three of these reports had been completed . They had been done by recognized authorities who had been imported for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area of need for some provisions , either provided by the city government or private agencies or commercially operated . It was obvious that Rowland Haynes , who had been employed by Burns , would be necessary , not only because of his technical knowledge but because of his unfinished work on one of the reports . We immediately engaged him to come and , in addition to advising us generally , to complete the reports of private and of public agencies . I decided to take charge of the report on commercial recreation , the one which had been involved in the explosion . I began the work in May and hoped to complete the survey by September when I was scheduled to leave for Minnesota . When I had a moment to think about the size of the task , I realized that even if the reports could be completed in four months , the task of organizing meetings to present them to the public would still remain . I realized that this would involve an emormous effort on my part to manage all that from a distance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Providence intervened to save me from what might have been a civic and personal catastrophe . I had accepted the Minnesota appointment without ever having seen the Minnesota campus . All that I knew was that it was a big institution and that some of the faculty whom I had met seemed congenial . So in June I decided to go to Minneapolis and survey the situation . The Chairman of the Department of Political Science was a very friendly and cooperative man named Cephas D. Allin . He was not a well known figure in the academic world but his ideas about building up the department seemed sound enough , and President Burton had assured him a generous allotment of money . Allin introduced me to the members of the department who were in residence and to other faculty people and the Dean . At dinner at his home he had as a guest a well known professor who had been recently appointed to a position at Harvard . With this brief test of the atmosphere , I returned to my hotel room and had a sleepless night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misgivings rose in my mind . I have always attributed these doubts to the contrast in the atmosphere in Minnesota with that of Cleveland . I had become accustomed to the colorful and varied cosmopolitan life there . On the other hand the atmosphere in Minnesota , which permeated the University , was that of the cold , prosaic , Scandinavian Northwest . The question which tortured me was whether I could ever be happy there . I concluded that I could not . So in the morning I sent a telegram to the faculty member who was acting in Hatton 's absence , asking that my job be kept open pending possible reconsideration . My meetings next day with more members of the faculty partially quieted my doubts , but not completely . When I returned to Cleveland , I learned at Reserve that my job had not been filled and that , due to a new schedule of salaries , my pay , if I returned , would rise to about the same as I would get under the arrangement in Minnesota . So with the assurance that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable time , I was in a state of uncertainty for two or three weeks . Meanwhile , with the help of Haynes , I had made progress with the survey . Goff was most friendly and cooperative and a mild friendship developed , for I grew to admire this vigorous , aggressive , and extremely intelligent man . My reports of progress to the Foundation Committee encouraged its members that the Foundation might soon resume the place in the community that it had held before the interruption . Our success so far with the Recreation Survey encouraged my belief that if I played my cards right I might get the Foundation Committee to offer me the position vacated by Burns . So I arranged a meeting with Miss Sherwin to discuss matters which I hoped would lead up to the big question in my mind . She was well pleased with our progress in finishing the work on the Recreation Survey . And she was especially impressed with Rowland Haynes , whom I had brought back to Cleveland to work on the finishing touches , and gratified by my success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . Then I tactfully brought up the question of what should be done with the Foundation after the Recreation Survey was disposed of . Whether I bluntly expressed interest in the job of Director I do not recall but I am sure that my hints were quite obvious . She said that she would consult with the other Committee members and see what they thought . This was characteristically Belle Sherwinesque . For such was her prestige in the field of social welfare and such was the dominance of her personality that , while pretending to consult her colleagues on the Com-  | mittee , she was really making up their minds for them . The result was that at a meeting of the full Committee shortly after , I was offered the position of permanent Director ( not Survey Director , Burns ' title ) at a salary of $5000 a year . I said I would accept if I could get my release from Minnesota . Whether the call of war-connected work had so depleted the ranks of men with my special qualifications , or because of circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise in salary over a period of two months . My salary at Reserve had been $1600 in May when the offer from Minnesota came with a salary tag of $3200 . Now in July I was offered $5,000 by the Foundation . 19 In late July I wrote to President Burton and Professor Allin saying that I had been offered the position at the Foundation and that I would like to have my release from Minnesota . I said further that while the opportunity at the Foundation was exceedingly attractive for the short run , ultimately I intended to return to university teaching . Perhaps this suggestion gave them the idea of giving me a leave of absence at Minnesota with leave to go there the next year if I so chose . This was a most generous action which I always appreciated . During the Christmas holidays , the Dean from Minnesota called on me in Cleveland and I told him that I had decided to remain at the Foundation . So far as my interests were concerned , it was exceedingly fortunate that I remained at the Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of my record there that the people at Columbia decided to invite me to come to New York . When it was announced that I had been chosen as Director of the Foundation , a friend asked me how it felt to be the social work " boss " of the city . When I asked him what he meant , he said that my predecessor , Allen Burns , had been so regarded . I replied that I had no such ambition , that I was there to get the surveys done competently , to pick the subjects for the next study , and generally to promote the prestige of the Foundation in the life of Cleveland . And yet , as I settled into the job , it became apparent that the expectation that ultimately the Foundation would be distributing large sums for civic and charitable purposes gave me a prominence and attention far beyond my merits as an official or a personage . Perhaps I have in the preceding sentence used the word that distinguished the Ray Moley who had been appointed Director from the Assistant Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position I now occupied . In approaching the task of public relations , I worked on the principle  | that characterized my conduct as an editor in later years , that whatever was good for me was good for the institution I represented . When September came I gave up my old office at Reserve and moved to a suite of Foundation offices which I rented in an office building next to the Cleveland Trust Company . My personal situation was favorable to the responsibility I had assumed . I had been a good friend of Allen Burns and I was favorably known to his many friends as a moderately liberal individual in matters political , economic and social . Burns remained my friend after I assumed the office he had held , for he regarded the independent action of the Committee in reviving the recreation survey and choosing me without consulting Goff as a personal vindication . He was still proceeding with his Americanization studies , the printed volumes of which were coming out in 1920 and after . I felt it to be wise to move into the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club which was an organization which had a Saturday luncheon forum ; the Advertising Club ; the Automobile Club , which was very important because of its legislative influence ; and the Chamber of Commerce . The Union Club , founded , I believe , by Mark Hanna , I did not join , first because the dues and prices were beyond my means , and second because I was not asked . My liberal instincts were in those years quite opposed to the class distinctions in Cleveland . At Reserve I had been quite critical of the fraternity and sorority systems . My comments on the subject were based on the usual argument against them ? discrimination on religious lines . But my views had little impact against the vested interest of the alumni and the strong traditions behind them . However , I carried my views on the subject when I moved to New York and have never joined a club which excluded Jews from its membership . At the end of my working days the only club of which I was a member was the Chicago Union League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and during political conventions . In Cleveland , to a degree seldom found in a big American city , there was a distinct power structure . Whenever any project was considered which concerned the city as a whole , there were a dozen or so individuals who could be summoned to assure its success . This power structure by its support of the annual drives had practically eliminated the jealousies and rivalries which had existed in earlier years . I always thought of the power structure when I noted the " wax works " on the speaker 's dais when some special dignitary was being entertained . Always lined up for all to see ,  | there was someone from the various religious groups , the Chamber of Commerce , the Welfare Federation , the University , the newspapers , and the public schools . I often wondered when the poor editors of the papers ever got their work done because of their constant attendance at some luncheon or dinner . I noted that , as our Foundation activity got better known , I was invited up there too . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter of 1919-20 . In this the assistance of Rowland Haynes was most important . He was the expert . I was the manager , although I appeared as author of the report on commercial recreation . When the reports were finished , I had them attractively printed in formats identical with the reports of the education survey . There are seven volumes , for we decided on a final volume summarizing the lessons of the other six special reports . And when the printed copies were ready , I arranged a series of Saturday meetings at the City Club where the authors stated their findings and submitted themselves to questions . Very considerable newspaper publicity flowed from these , and the community received a useful lesson about the needs and problems of the people of the city who , after all , spent far more hours of the day in recreation than they spent at work or school . Cleveland was a city of organizations and for almost every activity or problem it had its reflection in some sort of agency or committee . As I have indicated , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Welfare Federation . In dealing with the recreation survey , I followed this pattern . At meetings of the pertinent people there was developed the Recreation Council which should be supported by the Welfare Federation and should devote itself to the implementation of the recommendations of the survey . Rowland Haynes had made a most favorable impression upon my Committee and he was the choice for the job of secretary of the new Recreation Council . He came to Cleveland permanently and after a few years became the Director of the Welfare Federation , succeeding Sherman Kingsley . During my first year with the Foundation , I gave considerable thought to what the Foundation might do after the completion of the recreation survey . There was no lack of suggestions , all of which I carefully appraised , and some of which I discussed with Belle Sherwin and others . Some of these were of minor importance and certainly were not of a character to challenge the attention of the community . Some came from matters which momentarily challenged the interest of the public nationally and locally . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me by Ambrose Suhrie , who was head of what was then known as the Cleveland Normal School . Suhrie was a most ambitious and hard-driving individual  | who wanted the status and size of his institution to play a larger part in the educational system of the city . There was nothing really challenging in such a survey but I agreed that if Suhrie would get the money from the Board of Education and recommend someone to direct the study , I would give it an independent character by having the Foundation sponsor it . The report was made , an enlarged program was recommended for his school , and the name was changed to the Cleveland College of Education . I made no special effort to publicize the content of this small study . It dealt with a matter of almost routine procedure for action by the Board of Education and would have inconsequential interest to the people of Cleveland . Its sponsorship by the Foundation was merely to give its recommendations some weight with the Board of Education . Meanwhile another matter came to my attention which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on for a really important concern to occupy the attention of the Foundation .  | What Was on the Immigrants ' Minds In late 1919 and early 1920 , just as I was winding up the Recreation Survey , two political developments sharply challenged the rational , humane concern which had characterized the Americanization movement . These developments turned my mind to the question of whether there was anything the Foundation might do to help . One of the political developments was the launching by the Soviet Union of a systematic invasion of the Western nations for the purpose of exporting Communist doctrine and methods ... . The Soviet inspired and directed campaign of subversion and espionage was well exploited by a press still hungry for news after the glut of the war years . American servicemen were returning in great numbers to their home communities and their excess of patriotism , rapidly being mobilized into units of the American Legion , resulted in several violent clashes with radical groups , mostly in the Western states . One such clash , at Centralia , Washington , growing out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting and some casualties . This excess of unspent patriotism among so many who remained unemployed after shedding their uniforms had its inevitable impact upon politics at home .... Among the candidates for the Democratic nomination for President ... was A. Mitchell Palmer , Attorney General , who took advantage of the " red scare " to launch official raids on organized groups because of their alleged Communist sympathies , with countless arrests of individuals . His efforts were plentifully aided by vigilant citizens ' groups who sated their zest for invading the privacy of their fellow citizens by hunting for alien propaganda . I found myself agreeing with many of the friends with whom I had been associated in Americanization activities that the hysteria of the " red scare " could do great damage to the ties of understanding we had built up between the native and the foreign born in the city . It seemed to us that the antagonism to radicalism , which people quite naturally associated with  | immigrants from the Communist-infected countries of Eastern Europe , could seriously impair the structure of confidence so essential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might do to counter the effects of the hysteria which seemed to threaten even the relatively quiet foreign-born population of Cleveland . It seemed that while I was searching for a large project to occupy our attention , I might try an experiment which had been in my mind for a long time , something which was within the limited means of the Foundation . It seemed to me that the best way to keep an anti-alien feeling from spreading would be to go directly to a considerable number of immigrant workers in the industries of Cleveland and , through sympathetic questioning , learn something of their attitude toward their adopted country . We would seek to find out what they liked about their new environment ; what they did not like ; what their attitude was toward their jobs , their employers , their fellow workmen , their home life and such social contacts as they had beyond where they worked and lived ; and , above all , their understanding of and attitude toward the American government , local and national , and American politics . What I hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture , however limited , of the immigrants ' problems of adjustment and thus , by communicating such information to the city power structure in industry , government and social life , to promote attitudes and action to correct what was wrong and promote a better relationship all along the line . We are now in the 1970s and are so accustomed to polling and opinion analysis that my plan will seem the most natural thing to do . But it must be remembered that in 1920 such sampling and interviewing was quite unusual . And I was to discover , from the objection made by Leonard Ayers , that it was frowned upon in academic life . I remembered that a young economist from Seattle , Carlton Parker , had stirred up a national convention of economists by a paper which called for more examination of the psychological elements in labor relations . In the course of my planning , I went to New York and talked with Walter Lippmann who was then one of the editors of the New Republic . He was encouraging and suggested that I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was called What 's on the Worker 's Mind . To help enlist the interest of Fred Goff in what I was going to propose to my Committee , I talked with him about my idea . He looked a bit puzzled ... and I sensed a bit doubtful of the quality of my thinking . He said nothing for a long minute and then left his desk and looked down at the  | busy street below . " Yes , " he said slowly , " let 's find out what they think . And then do what we think is good for them . " I am quite sure that this was a concession far greater than I would have heard from most Cleveland businessmen . One of them , a director in Goff 's bank and a big employer , had said a year earlier , when I asked the Mayor 's War Board for Americanization money , that we ought to make the immigrant worker happy , because if we did not , he would go home to Europe . He did not want that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would raise hell with the unions . I got the money but certainly not for the reason he had in mind when he gave it . With Belle Sherwin in agreement , I had no trouble winning the approval of the Committee . To make such a study we needed someone who was experienced in the art of interviewing and who had a command of some of the languages of Eastern Europe . For not only were the Slays and Hungarians predominant among Cleveland workers , but any trouble with Communism would be more likely to come from that region . Hungary had a Communist government for a while after the war and , of course , the great Communist " threat " was in Russia . With rare good fortune I had a friend who exactly fitted the requirements . He was a young Hungarian newspaperman , named Joseph Remenyi . He had been employed by the Hungarian newspaper called the Szabadsag . The word means " liberty " but the newspaper , while prosperous , was generally won over to the side which offered the largest sum for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag . " Remenyi was unhappy working for the paper and eagerly accepted my offer . He had been born in Pressburg , Czechoslovakia , of Magyar parents and received his education in Budapest , Paris , and Munich . He had an excellent command of the Hungarian language and also most of the various versions of the Slavic . He was a friendly , disarming individual which made him an ideal interviewer . He was also an accomplished student of the literature of Eastern Europe and he later wrote a novel ... in his native Magyar . After his year with the Cleveland Foundation , he was employed by the Cleveland Trust Company as a business and public relations man among the foreign born . Later he was added to the faculty of Cleveland College as a professor of comparative literature . In my discussions with him I made sure to determine whether he actually had any political predelictions which might impair his objectivity . I found nothing more than might be found in any lover of human nature and fine literature . He had been in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weaknesses and strengths of our ways . Fortunately he was singularly free of the ideological baggage which is brought here by so many Eastern Europeans . A strong individualist himself , he was mainly interested in the people he interviewed as individuals with their own special interests , problems and prejudices . He was also free from the cursed habit of generalizing about every particular , which is presented as a substitute for wisdom . He did not try to see the forest . He saw the trees and the leaves and the insects on the leaves and the bark , and the special characteristics of growth which distinguished one tree from another . In preparing for his interviews , he prepared a lengthy questionnaire which he checked over with my friend Gehlke . With the limited number of interviews , the statistical work was comparatively simple . Remenyi 's method was far from that of a census taker . On his evenings and on Sundays he mingled with the immigrants in their communities . He talked informally with them in his role as a newspaperman in their homes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the streets . He did not interview anyone at his place of employment . To avoid any hint of formality , he never took notes while conducting an interview . He had a good reporter 's memory and the next day he came to my office and wrote down the results . He spent the better part of 1920 on his interviews and on the text of his reflections . This was most helpful to me in my own interpretation . Our aim had been 500 interviews , but we found the final number of usable reports to be 390 . They were of assorted nationalities . Since Remenyi was more familiar with the Hungarian people and their language , the greater number of cases were of that nationality . But there were also Slovaks , Bohemians , Polish , Ukranian , Serbian , and a very few Germans , Croatians , Russians , Rumanians and Bulgarians . All except a very few were employed in Cleveland 's industries . Remenyi had made contact with about a hundred more than these but we rested our analysis upon the 390 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , date of arrival in the United States , religion , membership in union if any , literacy , marital status and family information . But the more important part of the reports was what the people said about their attitudes and reactions concerning their life in this country . For we were seeking something which was far more important than mere statistical information . We were concerned with these people as individual human beings , each with his own special prejudices , problems , and ideas . After the reports had been classified and reduced to tabulations , I asked Remenyi to write his own interpretation of what they had said . Then  | I studied the individual cases for myself and with some reliance upon Remenyi 's summary conclusions , I wrote my own interpretation . Because of the public interest in Communist influences , my first effort was to deal with that . I could find no evidence in the reports that there had been any systematic process or " apparatus " through which these people had been indoctrinated by agents of international Communism . That sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give his whole attention to the international aims of the regime . It is true that a few of the men interviewed had brought Marxist ideas with them and to a limited degree , these individuals , who were mostly the better educated , had talked Communism with their fellow workers . But they were not inspired by any foreign organization and were wholly unsystematic in their contacts . Such radical ideas , which he found among about twenty per cent of our interviewees , had been picked up here and there , from speeches in their communities , from literature they had been given , or what they had read in the newspapers . Above all , we found that wherever these views appeared , the people who expressed them had already formed an unfriendly opinion of their life in America because of resentment arising from experiences in their living and working relations , from real or fancied injustice , from simple homesickness , and disillusionment in what they found in their adopted country . Thus , at that time , the problem of dealing with radicalism was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , our little survey confirmed what has been true in every revolution and internal upheaval since civilization came along and kept records . The spark , ignited by the more sensitive and intelligent , finds fuel in the vast majority which , physically , mentally , or both , is unhappy within the environment . The " red scare " of the time I am writing about was unusual only in the influences at work from abroad and the converts here in our midst who had the intelligence and eduation and the malign intentions born of some grudge against our particular society . I asked myself and I asked Remenyi if this conclusion which we reached could be rooted in a predisposition . For thus our report would be a mere massing of proof behind what we already believed and which my experience in Americanization work had taught me . And so we went over the reports carefully to determine what the real evidence revealed . We were then satisfied in our conclusions and from here on our effort was to portray through many quotations from the interviews exactly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots of their unhappiness . One outstanding fact which was overwhelmingly supported by the interviews was that among the illiterate there was not only no radicalism  | but no vestige of any political idea . An illiterate could understand a king , or a governor , or a boss , but he could never envision such a thing as organization within the social order . And the degree of radicalism increased according to the amount of education these people had received . My own conclusions , which I fully recited in the text of my report , were based upon my examination of the interviews , upon Remenyi 's interpretation and several interviews which I had with experienced social and political workers who were themselves of the nationality of some of the people interviewed . I shall set down these conclusions of mine under captions which I used in my long report . 20 The Scrapping of Craftsmanship A root cause of unhappiness was the lack of industrial adjustment . A skilled worker abroad came to America . He found no market for his trade , so that being obliged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer respected his work , indeed he could not see his own contribution in any finished product on which numerous others had a hand . The joy of creative craftsmanship was gone . He brooded over his fall in the social order , for we must never forget that a true aristocracy may reside at the point where management leaves off . He was just like innumerable other fellow workers . There was no one to respect him . The fact that he must perform work which he does not respect led him to think that his employer did not respect him or his skill . He decided that his status could only be regained when all society was overturned . A Bulgarian shoemaker , not the cobbler who resoles your shoes but the truly skilled craftsman found only in Europe , says , " I was a respected shoemaker in Varna . I hear of America and came . I got a job in a coal mine in West Virginia . There I am put to work with the pick and shovel with hundreds of other laborers . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with common laborers . I do n't feel at home . I am going back . I never spoke to an American gentleman . I am inclined to Socialism because I am not satisfied . " Denial of Family Life A considerable number of the men interviewed seemed to have no cause for complaint except the lack of family ties or unhappy home conditions . Some of those had been separated from their families since 1914 . Some had not heard of them . They were drifting from one miserable  | boarding house to another . Americans should remember , I said in my report , that the life of boarders in a foreign district is the most abnormal state that can be imagined . Accustomed , perhaps , to rural life , they live under crowded urban conditions . Accustomed to the friendly life of a village , they spend their leisure hours in talking with a fellow countryman about the past . If they are normal single men , they live without association with decent respectable girls of their own type . " Single men in barracks , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaster saints . " The Impact of Prejudice Another group seemed to feel that their strangeness , " foreignness , " made them marks for sneers and condescension . There was a feeling that America did not welcome them , that a foreigner was not considered equal to an American . A Polish workman said , " Whenever I speak Polish on the street , people look at me as if I were a murderer . " Another said , " My friend and I talked loudly in the street and a policeman came by and called us Bolsheviks . " Another said , " My girl is eleven years old and goes to an American school . Now she is more prejudiced against foreigners than even American children . " The Barrier of an Alien Language This should be fairly obvious as a cause of unhappiness . It hardly needs comment . The individual before he learns English is locked in a world without communication , either through speech or the written word . And the illiterate in their own language are the most isolated of all . They find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Rivalry of the Past In their daydreams , in their waking hours , or the dreams that attend their sleeping hours , the immigrant lived in his native past . In contrast with his unhappy present , these glimpses were glorified . One of the people interviewed told Remenyi that on his days off he had a habit of loafing around the livery stable on another street . " It smells like home , " he explained . The Exploitation of Loneliness Surrounded by strangeness and tortured by homesickness , the im-  | migrant was an easy prey of a species which has plagued newcomers from colonial days . In the generation we are considering , these birds of prey were members of the immigrant 's nationality who had arrived some years before and , equipped with the English language and a superficial sophistication and a familiarity with the tricks which are practiced upon the ignorant and unwary , offered friendship and comradeship to the bewildered newcomer . Too often this seeming friend became the custodian of the immigrant 's savings , the seller of dubious insurance and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often the immigrant lost track of his alleged friend and found himself despoiled . Our Citizens ' Bureau cared for many of these people but only in those cases which came to its attention . These exploiters traveled from city to city to escape discovery . Failure of the Appeal of American Institutions Independence Day orators would have been surprised , when addressing a group of newly enfranchised , at the number of listeners who took their gaudy tribute to American political institutions with several grains of salt . For these people , who waited several years to win their citizenship , were quite familiar with American life . Among those who came later , and are removed several years from the crown of naturalization , the distrust of American institutions was already a reality . The interviews we studied revealed that there were many who could see no connection between the claims and the reality of American institutions of government . And of all Americans for whom the immigrant reserved his greatest contempt was the American politician . We Americans should awaken to the bitter truth that it is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he realizes that we are not all cast in the same mold . Disenchantment The overall conclusion which I reached after an examination of the material gathered by Remenyi was a story of disenchantment . Busy with the prosperity that the country had enjoyed in the past two or three decades , before and after the Wilson recession in his first year , and with the excitement which attended the war , Americans had forgotten the great additions to our population which every ship from Europe brought to our ports . The labors of our American workers which I have described was only  | scratching the surface of the problem . Granted that the stories of the promise of American life which had reached those countries of Eastern Europe and had induced the great emigration had been overstated , the reality of our life in America was not what we had been taught in our schools . The fact that some of these immigrants , mostly the better educated and the skilled , had turned radical was not the real problem . It was the failure of the promise of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished my report of the immigrant study in mid-1920 , the " red scare " had begun to fade as an issue . Palmer had failed to get the Democratic nomination and , as the campaign proceeded to the Harding landslide , it became evident that we were moving toward a period when a wearied public would show little interest in reform . I completed my report but did not show it to the Foundation Committee , for by this time my whole attention needed to be concentrated on the preparation for the vastly more pretentious survey of criminal justice . So the report and the materials upon which it was based were laid aside until more than two years later . At that time when I had already been officially appointed to the Columbia faculty and my resignation at the Foundation was imminent , I brought the immigrant study to the attention of the Committee and made its results public with certain consequences which I shall describe in a later chapter .  | The Cleveland Crime Survey In the summer of 1919 as I was approaching the end of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foundation . I was old enough and had lived long enough to have made the acquaintance of a considerable number of the leading citizens of the city and had identified myself with several rather important community affairs . But as I look back at the Committee 's decision to hire me , I wonder if my state of maturity justified the risk the members were taking with the potentially important institution for which they were responsible . While the four men on the Committee , Williamson , McBride , Fitzsimmons and Swasey , were important and well known members of the community , the truth is that Belle Sherwin was such a dominant and prestigious figure in that phase of the city which was concerned with humanitarian causes , and her family name was so important in Cleveland and throughout the nation , that the male members placed complete faith in her judgment of my capacities and judgment . The Foundation at that moment was not an active institution with policies well fixed and with a substantial body of public prestige behind it . For Burns ' indiscretion and Goff 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the memory of the sensational stuff that had been printed about the row had not died out in the public mind . Obviously the job I faced was to present the image of the Foundation to the city in such a favorable light that the past would be forgotten , or , if remembered , forgiven . This was a formidable job for an assistant professor for the ink was scarcely dry on the signature of Nicholas Murray Butler on my Ph.D . diploma. 21 However , I took up my responsibility with the self-confidence which had characterized my behavior in previous turns of fortune . This time , however , I was more aware of the risks involved and I decided to take plenty of time before deciding on the next major Foundation project . The overhaul of the schools several years before had been an ambitious un-  | dertaking , but the direction it took was fairly obvious for the system was reeking with inefficiency and obsolescence . The recreation survey really involved nothing about which there could be more than one opinion . Burns ' adventure into prostitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the considerations involved in any new project which was large enough and sufficiently interesting to the public to bring the Foundation back into the headlines , and constructive enough to win the support of the more responsible people of the community . I took some time in winding up and publicizing the recreation survey and fending off several proposals to plunge the Foundation into small and unimportant community affairs . Certainly I was convinced that the recreation survey would be the last venture into social uplift , for however important children 's playgrounds and settlement houses might be in building character , they were not matters which the whole community would get excited about . And the terribly long drawn out discussion over the school survey , which had been directed by an uninspiring Dr. Ayers , was about all that the community could stand for a long time to come . I shared much of the feeling said to be expressed by Lord Melbourne , " I am tired of hearing about education . I am tired of talking about education . I am tired of being educated . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to excite the minds and emotions of the whole community and sufficiently comprehensive to dominate the news for a considerable number of months , and sufficiently constructive to be of lasting benefit to the city . A clue to the answer came when my friend Charles Elmer Gehlke , who taught sociology and statistics at Reserve , told me one day that the Foundation might make a major study of delinquency , meaning juvenile delinquency . This led to an answer to my quest , for my mind immediately moved beyond juvenile delinquency to the broader field of crime , police , prosecution , the courts , and law enforcement generally . The subject fascinated me in part because of my earlier interest in studying law , and because of the research I had conducted in writing my essay on the Cleveland Municipal Court . Also , through Levine , I had measurably kept informed about the courts and other related matters in the years since 1913 . Above all , I realized that crime and the law were subjects which were sure means of attracting public attention . The newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this subject appealed to me was the dreadful conditions which had prevailed in Cleveland 's agencies for law  | enforcement during the past three years . 22 I realized that if I got the Foundation into the cockpit of law enforcement , we simply must succeed . There had already been at least three efforts to do something about the mess and nothing had resulted . In approaching the decision provoked by Gehlke 's suggestion , my feelings must have been dominated by considerations which my hero Edmund Burke had put into a famous passage long ago and which Professor Massotti had quoted in what he wrote about the Cleveland survey : It is an undertaking of some delicacy to examine into the causes of public disorders . If a man happens not to succeed in such an inquiry , he will be thought weak and visionary ; if he touches a true grievance , there is a danger that he will come near to persons of weight and consequence , who will rather be exasperated at the discovery of their errors , than thankful for the occasion of correcting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorites of the people , he will be considered as a tool of power ; if he censures those in power , he will be looked on as an instrument of faction . But in all exertions of duty , there is something to be hazarded . In my case , there was everything about my future to be hazarded . The situation in Cleveland in the year or two after the Armistice is the best illustration of a rule in social behavior which has been noted over and over . It is characteristic of human beings in the mass that while the capacity for moral indignation is very great , its staying power has rather short limits . Put in other words , moral indignation is too often followed by a failure of moral endeavor . The most famous example of this syndrome was the reaction after President Wilson 's idealism to the election of Harding and the scandals that followed . Cleveland , after the brilliant Administrations of Johnson and Baker , elected in 1916 a Republican politician , Harry L. Davis , as Mayor and soon an assortment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same laxness affected the county government when a weak county prosecutor came into office . Another manifestation , which was later noted in the report of the survey , revealed itself . This was the perversion of the humanitarian policies of the Johnson years , first into permissiveness and then into that sort of laxness about crime and delinquency which is used by crooked officials to mask political mischief . This clearly came out in the statistics of the survey . Thus Cleveland suffered a severe breakdown in its public service in  | the years after 1916 , which , because of the war , was not noted until after the Armistice . Prior to 1920 there had been investigations and reports by the Bar Association , the City Council , and at least two grand juries . Also a continuous outcry by the newspapers and numerous appeals to the Mayor , the courts and the Governor . But nothing much was done in the way of reform . Finally , Mayor Davis in early 1920 resigned to run for Governor , and also to escape the intensifying heat from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally weak and mediocre man , Law Director William Fitzgerald . It should be noted that the Harding sweep carried in Davis as Governor , although he failed to carry his home county . I watched things closely in 1920 , especially since moving the Foundation into the dangerous water of law enforcement was being considered . There was plenty to watch , for the crime statistics kept rising and the newspapers continued their crusade . Then an almost incredible thing happened . The Chief Justice of the Municipal Court , William H. McGannon , was indicted and tried for murder . 231 While this trial , which had thoroughly aroused the people of Cleveland , was under way , I decided to lay the groundwork for action by the Foundation . I spoke with several lawyer friends about the practical problems that such a survey would involve and the manner in which it might be launched and conducted . Finally , late in the year , I spoke with Goff . He was , as I have indicated , essentially a reformer . He listened attentively as I unfolded my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he approved . He said that his first step would be to speak with Mayor Fitzgerald and get him to urge the Foundation to make a comprehensive examination of the entire system of law enforcement in the city and county . I had already arranged with the officers of the Bar Association to make a similar request . This they did following Fitzgerald 's letter . Several other civic organizations added their requests . In a short time Goff assured me that he would raise the necessary money for such an undertaking and all seemed ready for action by my Committee . I felt sure of strong newspaper support , for the editors and , more important , staff members were friends of mine and I had hinted to them that the Foundation might undertake the survey if we could be assured of strong public support . Moreover , I had long ago secured the approval of the members of my Committee and of Garfield , our Counsel . Everything was ready for an announcement in December , 1920 , but because I learned that the McGannon case might be declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last day of December the trial was discontinued because of the disagreement and I decided to ask the Committee to announce its intention  | to make the survey . This it did on January 4 , 1921 . In this announcement , as in the Mayor 's letter , the resolution of the Bar Association , and my explanation of our intentions which I gave to the newspapers , a single theme was stressed . Our concern in this survey was not headhunting . Whatever might exist of official misconduct was the job of the appropriate government authorities . The Foundation was not a prosecuting agency and it lacked the powers essential to unearth official wrongdoing . The problem was not individuals , I said repeatedly ; it was the system which simply did not do what it was intended to do . The study , we promised , would be by authorities whose competence and objectivity could not be questioned . Since the Cleveland Bar Association had been intimately involved with the problems of law enforcement , I felt it to be of the utmost importance to keep this professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formation of an Advisory Committee composed of lawyers with an outstanding attorney as its Chairman . Again , after consultation with the President of the Bar Association , we invited Amos Burt Thompson to serve and he accepted . Thereafter , we kept him close to the operation , meeting with the Committee throughout . Thompson was a member of the firm of Thompson , Hine and Flory , which in the legal profession occupied a middle ground between the majority of personal injury lawyers and the big firms representing large corporate clients . Thompson was a Vermonter who spoke in the peculiar idiom of his native state . He was an independent in every one of life 's relations . Keenly concerned with the integrity of the government 's services , he was shocked and saddened by the deterioration he had seen in the courts and was willing to give us as much of his time as was demanded . He probably kept as close to every aspect of the survey as anyone on my Committee , and he was always helpful with his vigorous comments . Since we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present , I well remember over the years his regular order , " Half and half with graham crackers . " He lived beyond ninety and was present at the office every day . Years later , possibly in the 1940s , I used to get long letters from him complaining about the practices of some of the banks . From the time that the survey first came under consideration , I had been mulling over names of possible directors . In line with Foundation policy , established by Goff , there was to be a permanent Director , or executive , working with the Committee in Cleveland . And for each survey someone with a national reputation as an expert usually was brought from outside the city . ... In the case of our Criminal Justice Survey , cir-  | cumstances demanded a large part of the direction by me . . . . The general director . . . obviously . . . had to be a highly respected lawyer , distinguished enough to have the full confidence of the Cleveland Bar and the citizen leaders . The list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which for one reason or another were crossed off , and the final choice was between John H. Wigmore and Roscoe Pound . My familiarity with Pound 's writing came from the writing of my essay on the Cleveland Municipal Court , in which I included a sprinkling of quotations from Pound 's article on the administration of justice in the modern city . But I knew enough of Wigmore and of lawyers ' opinion of him to prefer him over Pound . Almost every lawyer I consulted preferred Wigmore . Wigmore , Dean of the Law School of Northwestern University , was best known for his towering masterpiece , Wigmore on Evidence . This was beyond doubt the foremost American product of legal scholarship . Lawyers everywhere were familiar with it and judges had written it into the prevailing case law . In my statement to the Committee , I took note of his high qualifications but added that " he lacks tact . " Pound 's reputation beyond the Harvard Law School , where he presided as Dean , rested on his legal scholarship , his facility as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers . Wigmore had brought Pound from his native Nebraska to Northwestern as a professor . Later Pound had moved on to Harvard as Dean . Wigmore acknowledged Pound 's legal and historical scholarship but strongly disapproved of him as a candidate for the Cleveland assignment . Incidentally , the range of Pound 's interests is suggested by the office he held in Nebraska . He was State Botanist . After several trips to Chicago and much discussion , Wigmore finally ruled himself out . He was needed , he said , to raise money for his Law School . So I turned to the task of interesting Pound . I developed a great liking for him largely for reasons which I felt sure would make him popular in Cleveland . He was a true son of the Middle West . He never belonged to the New England tradition . He was a salty , good humored man , full of funny stories and exceedingly shrewd . While he had expressed views concerning the administration of justice which were rated liberal , he was as solidly Republican and as conservative as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1950s , he had hardened in his opposition to the radical views of the times . One of the oddities for which he was outstanding in  | Cambridge was his habit of disdaining an overcoat in the cold New England winter . In 1921 , and I assume later , he was completely devoid of teeth . He told me that this was the result of an accident . But his capacity for adaptation prevailed and he had no trouble eating and speaking . He also told me that he owed his prodigious memory to training , for in his younger years he had weak eyes . Despite these handicaps , he lived to be ninetyfour . His sister , a distinguished scholar and writer , was the first woman to be elected to the Nebraska Sports Hall of Fame . She was Western Woman 's Champion in both tennis and golf ... . Pound was most interested in the idea of the survey , for he saw it as a way to confirm his ideas about the problem of law administration in large urban communities . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of but he was afraid that his absence from the Law School would subject him to severe criticism . So he proposed that he accept the nominal directorship of the survey , work on the plans , review the reports , and make a speech in Cleveland launching the survey . He would also contribute one of the individual reports . For the actual management , he suggested that we associate with him as Co-Director Professor Felix Frankfurter who had joined his faculty in 1914 . I considered this arrangement far from ideal , especially since in conferring with Frankfurter I found that he would promise only fortnightly trips to Cleveland . But since it seemed the only way to bring the great prestige of the Harvard Law School behind our undertaking , I recommended the appointments to the Committee . At the same time I made clear that I would have to strengthen my Foundation staff and do a lot of the managing myself . When the selections were announced , I had my hands full for a time quieting the opposition to Frankfurter . Garfield strongly objected , quoting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor disputes during the war . TR had regarded Frankfurter as an irresponsible radical . But when the Committee accepted my recommendation , Garfield subsided . There was plenty of protest from lawyers and from some businessmen . Some were based upon his radicalism and some , I suspect , on racial grounds . The latter objection had always had a singularly irritating effect upon me , largely because it seems so irrelevant in choosing someone for a purely secular job and partly because I felt such a sense of obligation to Manuel Levine . I selected a letter from Harold Clark , my old friend on the Americanization Committee , as a suitable occasion to answer at some length these objections to Frankfurter . I argued that Frankfurter 's views  | were no more radical ( or liberal ) than had been evidenced by the Cleveland electorate at repeated elections ; they were , indeed , no more liberal than those of Tom Johnson or Baker or Witt , and that certainly Frankfurter had the qualifications necessary to evaluate the agencies which would be under investigation . Wigmore , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frankfurter in a letter to me . As a matter of policy the selection of the topical divisions of the survey and the prospective authors of the reports was a responsibility of the two directors , but Frankfurter consulted me before inviting any of them . The divisions seemed to be quite logical : Police . Raymond Fosdick , whose two books on European and American police systems were standard works on the subject , was a lawyer with close relations with the Rockefellers . Subsequently he served as President of the Rockefeller Foundation . He was a brother of Harry Emerson Fosdick , long pastor of Rockefeller 's Riverside Church in New York . Judicial Administration . Reginald Heber Smith was nominal director of this study but the major work in Cleveland was done by a junior in his law firm in Boston , Herbert Ehrmann . Smith had earlier made a survey which was embodied in a book written by him titled Justice and the Poor . This was done under a grant from the Carnegie Foundation . Prosecution . Pound selected Alfred Bettman for this . Bettman had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time as an Assistant U.S. Attorney General . He was assisted by Howard Burns , a brother of Allen Burns and a lawyer in the Newton Baker law firm . Penal and Correctional Institutions . Burdette Lewis was Commissioner of Corrections in the State of New Jersey . A bit later the directors selected Herman Adler who was State Criminologist of the State of Illinois to make a study which was called , when completed , Medical Science and Criminal Justice . Later still , Albert M. Kales was selected to report on Legal Education in Cleveland . Meanwhile I had selected a staff of my own which was housed in my office . We had temporary quarters for the survey directors in a hotel near the courthouse where the out-of-towners had sleeping quarters when they were in town . Since the statistical work would be a major component in all the  | reports , I selected Gehlke , who secured a leave at Reserve . He was a tower of strength in the survey and his " mortality tables " were the most strikingly original contribution of the whole investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was connected in later years in Missouri , New York , Illinois . To handle all publications which we issued later and to keep in touch with the press , I was able to get a respected newspaperman named John Love who had been writing a business column for the Plain Dealer . My secretary . Helen Chew , who had been my student at Reserve , had an assistant , also my former student . While I was scrupulous about keeping my hands off the methods used by the people who were responsible for the various divisions of the survey , I kept in close touch . Indeed , since these people were strangers in Cleveland , they were most anxious to have my help . I arranged all the necessary contacts with the officials concerned . I maintained cordial relations with the volatile Frankfurter during his fortnightly visits to Cleveland . While I realized that he and his surveyors were there to tell the people of Cleveland about their government , I found that Frankfurter needed plenty of guidance about dealing with the people . In that year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite his cosmic pretensions , his knowledge of the United States and its people was limited to the Eastern seaboard . Indeed I doubt if he had ever been west of Chicago until he made his trip to Bisbee , Arizona , during a labor crisis during the war . 24 Clearly he felt in Cleveland that he was in a new and strange country . When the survey was about half finished , he proposed to the Committee that there be a division of the survey which would deal with the influence of the newspapers in the administration of justice . To this suggestion Garfield , Thompson and I objected . We held that since we depended upon the press to publicize the survey and to help bring about the adoption of its recommendations , it would be poor policy to antagonize the newspapers by criticizing them . But after some discussion , the Committee authorized the study and , probably on the recommendation of some of Frankfurter 's friends on the New Republic , he secured a man named M.K. Wisehart to come to Cleveland and undertake it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegated my staff member , John Love , to give Wisehart all possible cooperation . 25 When the Wisehart report was finished and before the Committee for approval , the argument was resumed . This time the opposition argued that not only was it unwise to publicize a criticism of the newspapers , but the  | report itself was a poor piece of workmanship and unfair in its conclusions . For its thrust was wholly negative . It gave the press no credit for developing the public opinion which made the survey possible . There was a long and heated discussion in a Committee meeting in which Miss Sherwin defended the report and favored its publication . Frankfurter was present and when we left and returned to my office , our talk became highly personal . He said , obviously in a state of great irritation , " I am getting tired of educating your people out here . " I replied with some heat that he was a snob . Other pejorative words were exchanged . The next day he sought aid and comfort from Belle Sherwin , throwing into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it served his purpose . Garfield , Thompson and I sought the opinion of Newton Baker , who replied as follows : " I am satisfied that we ought not to print the Wisehart report as a section of the final report of the survey for two reasons : First , it seems to be inadequate , and , second , we are now at a place in the Cleveland Crime Commission 's work where we will need cooperation at every point from the newspapers . This sort of cooperation we can better secure if we do not start out in the attitude of criticism . " ( Baker , in referring to the Crime Commission , meant the follow-up organization which had already been formed and of which Baker was one of the directors . ) Despite this opinion of Baker , Frankfurter won the day and the Wisehart report was ordered to be printed . I had the last word , however , for I did not issue the report as a separate document . There was no public meeting to publicize it and I buried it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the editors saw it , they were smart enough to keep it out of their newspapers . 26 Considering the immense area covered by the survey , the reports were completed before the year-end deadline . That this was accomplished was due to the constant reminders which I gave to the authors for expedition , for public opinion is short of breath and moral indignation soon fades . Surveys are all notoriously slow in completion . The survey of Springfield , Illinois , about which Vachel Lindsay wrote a book , was ten years in the making . And an alleged survey of criminal justice in Boston , for which Frankfurter got some money from the Rockefeller Foundation and started some years after his Cleveland experience , was , so far as I know , never finished . We in Cleveland in 1921 could not afford to be leisurely . The first of the reports was given to the public at a meeting on September 13 , 1921 ,  | and there followed five more at intervals until the next year . We used the City Club Saturday forum meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have mentioned from time to time in this story , was a popular institution in Cleveland . It prided itself on the catholicity of its acceptance of all sorts of opinion and the freedom which was allowed the audience to question speakers after their performance . The meetings , generally attended by from 200 to 500 , were most lively and were occasionally very spirited indeed . It seemed wise , however , to have some subsequent meetings by other organizations for discussions of some aspects of the survey . The report on Medical Science and Criminal Justice was released at a meeting of the Academy of Medicine . At these meetings I had to provide printed copies of the printed report with the author as the speaker . In his detailed account of the survey , Professor Massotti says : " The results of the Survey were not confined to Cleveland . Moley and several of the survey 's project directors spoke to professional and reform organizations all over the country . Moley spoke before the Ohio Welfare Council Conference in Toledo , to the 27th Annual Meeting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city slum symposium in Philadelphia , a meeting of the Louisville Bar Association , and many other civic groups . " In Nathaniel Howard 's book Trust for all Time , a history of the Foundation issued on its 50th birthday , he says that there were sixty-seven speeches made in Cleveland , and twenty-five in other states and cities . I am not sure where he got the statistics but the figures are believable , and I probably made most of the out-of-town appearances . It seems that , due to the industry of Frankfurter , other speeches were delivered by eminent people . In one newspaper account it was noted that Harlan F. Stone , then Dean of the Columbia Law School , ultimately Chief Justice of the United States , made a speech before the Toronto Bar Association , in which he said that the Foundation survey had blamed the troubles in Cleveland on the " inferior bar " of the city . Also some people attributed the upset in Cleveland which resulted in the adoption of the new city charter and the election of a reform mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleveland , which was widely distributed to publications for review , received a great deal of favorable comment . Frankfurter had it sent to various individuals and newspapers in England where it had a good review in the Times of London . Lord Haldane wrote , saying that the reports " would be studied exhaustively in many countries . "  | John Love practically monopolized an entire issue of the Survey Graphic . The report received good reviews in several law school reviews . Dean Stone of Columbia reviewed the survey in the Harvard Law Review , especially praising Pound 's summary report . One of the most important contributions of the survey was the pattern it set for the measurement of the competence of law enforcement agencies in other states and cities . Wherever , after this , bar associations or other civic bodies sought to improve law enforcement , the studies they made were patterned after the Cleveland survey . As we shall see later in this narrative , I was associated with several of these . However , I was not alone in the feeling that by far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did for the Cleveland Foundation . I had literally underlined the importance of the Foundation as one of Cleveland 's great institutions . This claim is fully acknowledged in Howard 's account , published on the Foundation 's half centenary and fortytwo years after the survey . I had taken a great risk , not only to my own career but to the Foundation , and had succeeded in escaping the pitfalls on every side . The survey was in the process of completion when I consulted with various lawyers about some sort of a permanent follow-up organization , a service which might act as the community 's eyes and voice in watching the agencies in law enforcement . Here we borrowed an idea from Chicago where its famous Crime Commission had been operating for some years . I interested a brilliant member of one of Cleveland 's law firms in serving as chairman of the new organization . At my suggestion he went to Chicago and made a thorough study of the operation of the Crime Commission . When he returned , he drew up the plans for a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Criminal Justice . This organization was duly installed with offices near the courthouse . As the first executive director , we selected a former agent in the Department of Justice with a staff which included two individuals who substantially spent their whole time in the felony court . The key to its operation was a card index file of all felony cases to be kept up to date with everything that happened as they passed along the production line . When information seemed necessary , the Association sent questions to the officials concerned . The governing board was a small committee which met with the Chairman and Director every week . The most eminent member of this committee was Mr. Baker . Others were well known lawyers and businessmen . This organization continued its work until the 1950s . Some readers may wonder why , in this long account of the origins ,  | operation , and results of the Criminal Justice Survey , I have not included at least a summary of its findings and conclusions . Among the reasons for this omission are the following : 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an anthology of all the writing with which I have been associated . Such an omnibus would be deadly dull as well as useless because so much that was written years ago is dated and specialized . 2 . The content of the reports of the survey was not written by me and reflects the views and facts gathered by several specialists . Much of what they found to prevail in Cleveland has changed with the years . Also their conclusions and findings were of conditions prevailing quite generally over the United States which were commented upon in many writings at the time , and since . 3 . The large comprehensive volume containing all the reports was widely distributed at the time and must be available in many libraries , especially law libraries . Moreover , in 1922 I wrote a summary of the survey which was published in a single volume which also must be available . Pound 's summary report was published in substantially the form in which he wrote it , and it must be among the books of his authorship . Moreover , my two books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Our Criminal Courts , have many of the findings uncovered in Cleveland . The latter book has just been reprinted for libraries . The really distinctive things about the surveys I managed in Cleveland were the manner and devices I employed to use them in educating the community and in securing community cooperation in putting the findings into the institutions involved . Also , my job involved the creation and mobilization of public opinion and the use of the city 's power structure to get reforms accomplished . In these respects I made a distinct and somewhat original contribution which was quite generally recognized at the time . Indeed , it is what I learned about creating public opinion and in organizing the research of many people that prepared me for the larger assignment I had with Roosevelt ten years later . Also , the survey was effective as contrasted with the various investigations that had preceded it because I was careful to make it known that we were not criticizing individuals but a system . As I indicated at the time the survey was started , we were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year after the Criminal Justice Survey was completed , which covered 1922 and some more , was one of almost unbroken idleness . Several small writing tasks occupied a part of the time and served to remind my Committee that I was doing something to earn my increased salary . There were several out-of-town trips involving speaking engagements in which I told of the survey and its results . There was a paperback summary of the survey to write and distribute , likewise a monograph summarizing the results of earlier surveys . I also initiated two publications which were supposed to appear annually , a Cleveland social work yearbook and a directory of social and civic agencies . For help on these I retained Professor Gehlke part-time . And in the summer months I spent a good deal of time at the ball park , a habit I developed when I was writing the report on commercial recreation . More important , there was plenty of time to think about myself , my future , and the future of the Foundation . I felt no compulsion to find another big survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that Cleveland needed a long rest from self-examination . Therefore , so far as my future was concerned , it did not rest with the Foundation . Beyond the making of surveys or special investigations , the job of such a Foundation as the one established by Goff would be doling out money to worthy and qualified charities , and generally keeping track of the way the Foundation 's money was spent . With increasing bequests coming due and rolling into the treasury of the Foundation , that sort of thing would go on year after year . My days would be occupied with interviews with hopeful donees , hour after hour , day after day , interminably . A horrible prospect of well paid boredom . This surely was not the way I intended to spend the prime years of my life . I could view the time already spent with the Foundation as well spent . The surveys had captured the interest of the public and the Foundation 's destiny was secure as a popular local institution . The Committee 's  | relations with Goff were cordial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would hover over the Foundation 's affairs like a loving mother-in-law in the home of a newly married couple . However , I made a guess that so active and vital a spirit as his would not long retain interest in children 's nurseries and rest homes . I was particularly appalled at the prospect of days full of office interviews . One sits there while the visitor tells his story , thinking up ways to pass the buck to somebody else . This occupied a fair part of my time when I served in the government with Roosevelt and it was the least exciting part of that very eventful year . Beneath and behind my unease that year was a desire to get back to teaching where meeting young people every day is a perpetual challenge to complacency , and the man behind the teacher 's desk is enjoying the flattery of a listening , although captive , audience . In the year and a half after the crime survey there was an additional small cloud on the otherwise bright surface of my life with the Foundation . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilians and other participants , two individuals who were to figure in my calculations were released from positions which they had filled in the War Department with Secretary Baker . They came to Cleveland and took positions made for them by Goff . One was Ralph Hayes who , as the Secretary of the City Club , had attracted the attention of Baker . Baker called him to Washington to serve as his secretary . Goff , having great confidence in Baker 's judgment , took Hayes into his private office as a sort of assistant . Release from the War Department also made it possible for Goff to call Leonard Ayers to the Cleveland Trust Company as a sort of economic prognosticator , in the belief common to many businessmen that a man with a slide rule can tell you anything you want to know . Ayers and his slide rule had measured education in the Cleveland survey and then , working for Secretary Baker , had condensed America 's war effort in a small book with all sorts of charts and tables . What next but to portray business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I suspect that Goff had another task for Ayers in mind when he brought him to Cleveland . This was to watch things at the Foundation to make sure that the Committee , which had shown such independence in making me Director , was not doing something of which Goff disapproved . At any rate , the Trust Company made Ayers secretary of the Foundation and later a member of the Committee . Ayers and Hayes were bachelors and lived together .  | Allen Burns , whose shoes I was selected to fill , on his various trips to Cleveland , made sure to put me on guard against Ayers . He told me that Ayers had told him in New York that the Committee had mistreated Goff by its independence . In addition to these evidences that Ayers was a potential critic of my policies after the big survey was my personal feeling toward him . He was one of the coldest human beings I ever had encountered . Hard as I tried to ease our relations , I never could make them cordial . About the only good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success of the crime survey was a comment he made to the effect that my judgment of public opinion was excellent . I assumed that he and Hayes had discussed the possibility of Hayes taking over the directorship of the Foundation if for some reason I left . This I determined to prevent at all costs and , as we shall see , I succeeded . Meanwhile , Ayers ' early career as a prophet had a severe jolt . In one of his bulletins he was very bearish about the automobile manufacturing industry . Looking at all the cars on the road and coldly figuring their future years of service , he stated that the car market was " saturated . " Nothing could have been more unfortunate because by a change of body styles about 1922 or 1923 the crafty car makers had car owners rushing to the dealers for one of the new models and a boom set in that was to last until the Great Depression . Like George Gallup , when his political predictions fall on their faces , however , Ayers was unperturbed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he failed to understand the human element in the car market . Customers seem to be perpetually happy with the wastefulness of their economic management . For despite their old car 's serviceability , the owner will trade it in for a new gadget or style change . I have always believed that part of Belle Sherwin 's reasons for wanting me in the Foundation , made in the years after the end of the war , was my professional capacity in the teaching of government . For she was gradually shifting her interest in social welfare to the work of the League of Women Voters . She had risen in that national organization to the point where she was made President in 1924 and to facilitate her operations she moved to Washington . Since I had joined the Foundation she had frequently consulted me about the educational work of the League . and in 1922 I had written at her request a small textbook on American politics and government , and in 1925 I brought out a revised edition . Our relations continued rather close after I went to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big educational meeting given by the League at Columbia  | University . 27 In September , George Baer , a judge of the Common Pleas Court , enlisted me as Chairman of the County Grand Jury for the autumn term . I enjoyed the opportunity to have an official position so near the center of the law enforcement system , and the human problems that came before us were fascinating . I had been interested by the great potential of the venerable Grand Jury inquest , powers that have survived from antiquity , for under its legal mandate , its authority could go far beyond the routine responsiblity of bringing in indictments . Some of the ancient language is still preserved in state law , such as the famous words in the prescribed oath of the Foreman , who " shall diligently inquire , and true presentment make of all matters and things . . . touching this present service . " In short , it might summon and interrogate under oath almost any public official and make a presentment of what it had learned . I made pretty good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad practices of county officials in enforcing prohibition . 28 At the end of the judicial term in December , the Grand Jury was required by law to inspect the county jail . We found conditions there to be very bad , chiefly because the old courthouse that housed the jail had long outlived its usefulness . The Sheriff , officially the jail keeper , went with me to Judge Baer asking him to call a meeting , and I was able to get Fred Goff to be the main speaker . Goff , ever the reformer , made a spirited speech , calling for a bond issue for a new building . Within a year the bond issue had been carried and the new building was being built . This proved to be my final contribution to the civic life of Cleveland , for I was to leave within the next year . It happened that Goff 's speech was destined to be his last , for he died in the spring of 1923 at the age of sixty-three . One morning in December on my way to the courthouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McBain at Columbia . I probably stood for some minutes attempting to collect my thoughts amid the crowd of workers hurrying through the snow . I 'm afraid that the thoughts I collected were irrelevant for rash emotion quite overwhelmed me . Despite icy December air , birds seemed to be singing on the ledges of the office building below which I stood . And heavenly music came through the barred windows of the bank before me . The theme in my ears was that this message in this little letter solved all my problems . He , without warning , came to rescue me from my doubts and problems in Cleveland . Once more I would be free to do what I loved best of all , teach . McBain , in his capacity as Chairman of the Department of Public Law , said that the members of the department and Dean Virginia C. Gilder-  | sleeve of Barnard College had agreed to recommend me to the Trustees for appointment as Associate Professor of Government . It was a most cordial letter which said that everyone concerned hoped that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my relations with every member of the department had always been pleasant . It is true that the position was less than a full professorship and the position would be financed in the Barnard budget , but the official appointment was like that of a Professor in Columbia University and the tenure was permanent . Moreover , this appointment would open the door to a career in the one university which I would have preferred above all others . McBain , in another letter , asked me to visit Columbia in January to meet Dean Gildersleeve and President Butler , and enjoy a reunion with all my friends on the faculty . During that visit I learned more about how the appointment came about . The Dean at Barnard , in keeping with the new status of women in political life , was anxious to establish a department of government in Barnard where only one course had been given over the years , usually by someone whose main job was in Columbia College or the Graduate Faculty . So my main responsibility would be at Barnard for the first year or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I intended ultimately to develop a graduate course , I would be relieved to spend the next year getting reoriented in the routine of teaching . And my success at Reserve in teaching women gave me every confidence about creating interest in government in the college . The wheels turned at Columbia and my appointment was confirmed in a matter of weeks . The matter of salary , which hardly concerned me at that time , was briefly discussed with the Dean . It would be $4500 for the first year . This was quite a drop from what I was earning in Cleveland , for I received $7000 from the Foundation and fees for lecturing on Americanization for the State of Ohio of about $2000 more . But we had never permitted our standard of living to control our lives and there were some savings . For reasons which I shall presently explain , I kept the Columbia appointment secret and private until May of the new year . There were several matters which I hoped to clear up at the Foundation . One was the final disposition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributed it to the members of my Committee . Also I arranged to deliver a summary of my conclusions at a Saturday luncheon meeting of the City Club . This went well enough and the newspapers gave it good coverage . But when the question of publishing it under the auspices of the Foundation came up , Ayers , who had just been made a member of  | the Committee , said he had some reservations . His point was that I had generalized from too few samples . This was the typical statistician 's gripe . I admitted that I was only partially resting my conclusions upon a statistical count of the interviews . That would have been an absurdity for many reasons : First , who was to say what number of samples would be enough ? Also , since the account of the interviews covered so many facts about each interviewee , it would involve something like a crossword puzzle to make a statistical count of the many facts . I explained that my report was an informed opinion , my own , based upon several years study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my conclusions were presented for the purpose of contributing to a public understanding of a serious community problem . I hardly needed to tell Ayers and the Committee that at least half of the divisions of the Ayers Survey of Education had been the presentation of experienced opinions of the experts he had imported for the purpose . But when this discussion took place I had already told the Committee of my Columbia appointment and , for reasons that I shall presently explain , Ayers was not really concerned about the " scientific " nature of the immigrant study . His real gripe at the moment was the fact that I had withheld the news of my projected resignation so long because I wanted to eliminate Hayes from directorship of the Foundation . Anyhow I was not interested in publishing the study through the Foundation and an argument with Ayers on that subject would be a waste of breath . So I proposed that the Committee give the completed report and the supporting documents to me for later publication by a publisher of my choosing . This was agreed to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After I moved to New York I became so busy with my new responsibilities that doing anything about the immigrant study remained on the back burner year after year . I still believe , as I noted earlier , that it was the finest piece of writing I had ever produced and the subject should still be of interest even though all of the people interviewed are probably dead . Remenyi is dead and no doubt the children and grandchildren of the unhappy and distracted strangers in America have in many cases taken their places in the life of Cleveland and are not concerned about the problems of their forebears . As I indicate above , I still believe that by delaying the news of my Columbia appointment I frustrated a plan long conceived by Ayers and Hayes to promote the election of the latter as my successor . For considering the prominence he had enjoyed during the war , he was certainly not planning to spend years of his life as a faceless assistant to the President of the Cleveland Trust Company . Something happened at about    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
