PERSONAL HISTORY AT WAR WITH MY AIN MY mother tells me now that I was six when the psoriasis showed ; I had imagined that she had earlier told me I was three . The dis  --  ease ? " disease " seems strong , for a condition that is not contagious , painful , or debilitat  --  ing ; yet it has the volatility of a disease , the sense of another presence coOccupying your body and singling you out from the happy herds of nor  --  mal mankind  --  first at  --  tached itself to my memory while I was lying on the upstairs side porch of our house in Shillington , Penn sylvania , amid the sickly , oleaginous smell of Siroil , on fuzzy sun-warmed towels , with my mother , sunbathing . We are both not quite naked . She would have been still a youngish woman at the time , and I remember being embarrassed by something , but whether by our being together this way or simply by my skin is not clear in this mottled recollection . Siroil and sunshine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war against the red spots , ripening into silvery scabs , that invaded our skins in the winter . Siroil was the foremost medi  --  cation available in the thirties and for  --  ties ; a bottled preparation the consis  --  tency of pus , tar its effective ingredient and its drippy texture and bilious color and insinuating odor deeply involved with my shame . Yet , as with our own private odors , those of sweat and ear  --  wax and even of excrement , there was also something satisfying about it , an intimate rankness that told me who I was . One dabbed Siroil on ; it softened the silvery scales but otherwise did very little good . Nor did abstaining from chocolate and " greasy " foods like po  --  tato chips and French fries do much visible good , though as with many palliations there was no knowing how much worse things would he other  --  wise . Only the sun , that living god , had real power over psoriasis ; a few weeks of summer erased the spots from all of my responsive young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken of me as a child , in  --  cluding a set of me in a bathing suit cavorting in the back yard , I can see no trace of psoriasis . And I remember , when it rained , going out in a bathing suit with friends to play in the down  --  pour and its warm puddles . Yet I never learned to swim , because of my appearance ; I stayed away from " the Porgy , " the dammed pond beyond the poorhouse , and from the public pool in West Reading , and to the travails of my freshman year at Harvard was added the humiliation of learning to swim , with my spots and my hydro  --  phobia , in a class of quite naked boys . Recently , the chunky , mild-spoken man who taught the class over thirty years ago came up to me at a party and pleasantly identified himself ; I could scarcely manage politeness , his face so sharply brought back that old sup  --  pressed rich mix of chlorine and fear and brave gasping and naked , naked embarrassment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  bolic disorder that causes the epider  --  mis , which normally replaces itself in the course of several days , markedly to speed up the process and to produce excess skin cells . The tiny mechanisms gone awry are still beyond the reach of internally taken medicine ; powerful drugs like methotrexate and cortisone help , but at the price of side effects perhaps more serious than the disease , which is , after all , superficial  --  too much , simply , of a good thing ( skin ) . In recent years , derma  --  tologists at Massa  --  chusetts General Hos  --  pital have developed PUVA , a controlled light treatment called photochemotherapy : fluorescent tubes ra  --  diate long-wave ultra  --  violet ( LTV-A ) onto skin sensitized by an internal dose of me  --  thoxsalen , a psoralen ( the " P " of the acro  --  nym ) derived from a weed , zinanti majus , which grows along the river Nile and whose sun-sensitizing quali  --  ties were known to the ancient Egyptians . So a curious primitivity , a savor of folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a total cure but the closest thing to it likely to emerge in what is left of my lifetime . I am grateful . It is pleasant , once a week , to stand nearly naked in a kind of glow  --  ing telephone booth . It was pleasant to lie on the upstairs porch , hidden behind the jigsawed wooden balusters , and feel the slanting sun warm the fuzzy towel while an occasional car or pack of children crackled by on Shill  --  ing Alley . One became conscious , ly  --  ing there trying to read , of bird song , of distant shouts , of a whistle calling men back to work at the local textile factory , which was rather enchant  --  ingly called the Fairy Silk Mill . My condition forged a hidden link with things elemental  --  with the sea  --  sons , with the sun , and with my mother . A tendency to psoriasis is in  --  herited . My mother had it ; that was why she was on the porch with me . Her mother had had it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my grandmother 's skin just her teeth , which slipped down while she was napping in her rocking chair . Far in the future I was to marry a young brunette with calm , smooth , deep-tanning skin and was to imag  --  ine that thus I had put an end to at least my particular avenue of genetic error . Alas , our fourth child inherited my complexion and , lightly , in her late teens , psoriasis . The disease favors the fair , the dry-skinned , the pallid prog eny of cloud-swaddled Holland and Ireland and Germany . Though my father was not red-haired , his brother Arch was , and when I grew a beard , as my contribution to the revolutionary sixties , it came in reddish . And when I shaved it off , spots had thrived under  --  neath . Psoriasis keeps you thinking . Strate  --  gies of concealment ramify , and self-examination is endless . You are forced to the mirror , again and again ; psoria  --  sis compels narcissism , if we suppose a ? Narcissus who did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face looks passable ; in slightly different lights , not . Shaving mirrors and rearview mirrors in automobiles are merciless , whereas the smoky mirrors in airplane bathrooms are especially flattering and soothing : one 's face looks tawny as a movie star 's . Flying back from the Caribbean , I used to admire my im  --  proved looks ; years went by before I noticed that I looked equally good , in the lavatory glow , on the flight down . I can not pass a reflect  --  ing surface on the street without glancing in , in hopes that I have some  --  how changed . Nature and the self , the great moieties of earthly exis  --  tence , are each cloven in two by an ambivalent , fascinated attention . One hates one 's abnor  --  mal , erupting skin but is led into a brooding , solic  --  itous attention toward it . One hates the Nature that has imposed this affliction , but only this same Nature can be ap  --  pealed to for erasure , for cure . Only Nature can forgive psoriasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant to other people this power . Perhaps the unease of my first memory has to do with my mother 's presence ; I wished to be alone with the air , the sun , the distant noises , the possibility of my hideousness gradually going away . I recall remarkably few occasions when I was challenged , in the brute world of child hood , about my skin . In the third grade , perhaps it was , the tear her , stand ing above our obedient rows , rummaged in my hair and said aloud , " Good heavens , child , what 's this on your head ? " I can hear these words breaking into the air above me and see my mother 's face when , that afternoon , I recounted them to her , probably with tears ; her eyes took on a frantic glare and the next morning , like an arrow that had fixed her course , she went to the school to " have it out " with the teacher who had heightened her defec tive cub 's embarrassment . Our doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond a retaining wall decorated with concrete orbs , also , eerily , had psoriasis ; far from offering a cure out of his magical expanding black bag , he offered us the melan choly confession that he had felt prevented , by his scaly wrists , from rolling hack his sleeves and becoming  --  his true ambition  --  a sur  --  geon . " ' Physician , heal thyself , ' they 'd say to me , " he said . I do n't , really , know how bad I looked , or how many conferences among adults secured a tactful silence from above . My peers ( again , as I re  --  member , which is a choosing to remember ) either did n't notice anything terrible about my skin or else ne  --  glected to comment upon it . Children are frank , true , as we know from the taunts and nicknames they fling at one another ; but also they all feel imperfect and vulnerable , which works for mutual for  --  bearance . In high school , my gym class knew how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy from a higher class came up to me with an exclamation of cheer  --  ful disgust , touched my arm , and asked if I had syphilis . But my classmates held their tongues , and their fear of contagion , if any . I participated , in gym shorts and tank top , in the annual gym exhibi  --  tions . Indeed , as the tallest of the lighter boys , I stood shakily on top of Fats Sterner 's shoulders to make the apex of our gymnastics pyramid . I braved it through , inwardly cringing , prisoner and victim of my skin . It was not really me , was the explanation I could not shout out . Like an obese person ( like good-natured Fats so sturdy under me , a human rock , his hands gripping my ankles while I fought the sensation that I was about to lurch forward and fly out over the heads of our assembled audience of admiring parents ) and unlike someone with a withered arm , say , or a port-wine stain splashed across his neck and cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Ai become normal and , as it were , beautiful . An overvaluation of the normal went with my ailment , a certain idealization of everyone who was not , as I felt myself to be , a mon  --  ster . Because it came and went , I never settled in with my psoriasis , never adopted it as , inevitably , part of my  --  self : it was , instead , a constant rude awakening . My last public demonstration of my monstrosity , in a formal social setting , occurred the day of my examination for the draft , in the summer of 1955 . A year in England , with no sun , had left my skin in bad shape , and the examining doctor took one glance up from his plywood table and wrote on my form , " 4-F : Psoriasis . " At this point in my young life I had a job offer in New York , a wife , and an infant daughter , and was far from keen to devote two years to the national de  --  fense ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Army as a big summer camp , with extra-rough bul  --  lies and extra-cold showers in the morning . My trepidation should be distinguished from political feelings ; I had absolutely no doubts about my country 's need , from time to time , to fight , and its right to call me to ser  --  vice . So suddenly and emphatically ex  --  cused , I felt relieved , guilty , and above all embarrassed at being singled out ; the naked American men around me had looked at my skin with surprise and now were impressed by the exemp  --  don it had won me . I had not foreseen this result ; psoriasis would handicap no killing skills and , had I reported in another season , might have been nearly invisible . My wife , when I got back to my parents ' house with my news , was naturally delighted ; but my mother , always independent in her moods , seemed saddened , as if she had laid an egg which , when candled by the government , had been Found rot  --  ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are humiliating ? " scab-pick  --  ing , " to use a term sometimes levelled at modern autobiographic writers . I have written about psoriasis only twice before : I gave it to Peter Caldwell in " The Centaur " and to an anonymous , bumptious ceramicist in the short story " From the Journal of a Leper . " I expose it this third time only in order to proclaim the consoling possibility that whenever in my timid life I have shown some courage and originality it has been because of my skin . Because of my skin , I counted myself out of any of those jobs  --  salesman , teacher , fin  --  ancier , movie star  --  that demand being presentable . What did that leave ? Be  --  coming a craftsman of some sort , clos  --  eted and unseen  --  perhaps a cartoonist or a writer : a worker in ink who can hide himself and send out a surrogate presence , a signature that multiplies while it conceals . Why did I marry so young ? Because , having once found a comely and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I dared not risk losing her and trying to find another . Why did I have children so young ? Because I wanted to surround myself with people who did not have psoria  --  sis . Why did I leave New York and my snug employment there ? Because my skin was bad in the urban shadows , and nothing , not even screwing a sun  --  lamp bulb into the socket above my bathroom mirror , helped . Why did I move , with my family , all the way to Ipswich , Massachusetts ? Because this ancient Puritan town happened to have one of the great beaches of the Northeast , in whose dunes I could , like a sin-soaked anchorite of old re  --  pairing to the desert , bake and cure myself . EVEN now , over a decade since left , Ipswich excites me to be in , On its familiar streets , greeted by small memories , reminiscent faces , al  --  tered facades , and enduring outlines , I feel lighthearted , desirable , healthy . I have presence . If Shillington gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the place where in my own sense of myself I ceased to be a radically defective person . I brought to the town , at the age of twenty-five , a number of tics and in  --  abilities that seventeen years of life there pretty much eased away . In Ips  --  wich , for instance , I stopped choking . My grandmother would sometimes choke on her food , and have to go out on the side porch in Shillington , where one or another member of the family would follow and hammer on her back while she clung , gagging , to the porch rail . It was one of our ob  --  servances , marking our familial awk  --  wardness , our shared tension . Whether by inherited tendency or imitated ex  --  ample , I , too , would choke now and then , and my album of sore moments holds a memory of crouching above my tray in the Lowell House dining hall at Harvard , miserably retching at something in my throat that would not go up or down , while half-swallowed milk dribbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silently took up their trays and moved away . On the edge of asphyxia , I sympathized with them , and wished I could shun me also . I had come to Harvard with not only this disgusting , frightening ten  --  dency , and an excitable stammer , and my skin , but a morbid fear of spiders and insects  --  specifically , a fear that they would become very large , a fre  --  quent theme of the movies and adven  --  ture stories of my boyhood . This pho  --  bia was not soothed by the growing power of photographers , as lenses and film improved , to bring us , in such educational magazines as National Geographic , images of the enlarged anatomies of bees and dragonflies , of sideways-munching mandibles and hairy pronged forelegs , of segmented antennae and many-facetted , hemi  --  spherical eyes . A playful roommate put on my desk one such spread of blowups ? especially vivid , in color , on the big pages of Life . Both offended and alarmed , I " acted out " my genuine fright and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilet . They were too large , and stiff , to go down , and kept sluggishly rising with their complicated and merciless faces , and I had to keep poking them with a ruler , to encourage them to vanish . I could not bear to touch them with my hands , and , even now , have a hard time plucking the bodies of dead wasps from the winter windowsills , where they get trapped behind the storm panes . Another roommate , from near  --  by Winchester , invited me home for  --  a meal ; I was served the great New England treat , lobster . I could not believe , seeing this scarlet arachnoid form set proudly before me , that I was expected to eat it , to take it into my fingers and tear off and suck its brittle limbs . My roommate 's mother , much as she might have tossed together a vegetable meal for a Hindu friend her son had brought back from exotic , broadening Harvard , kindly fried up a hamburger for me instead . In Ipswich , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tidal mud for the edgy smooth forms of clams , like rocks except they are alive , and feel alive , with an ever-so-subtle sense of motion in your palm , even of emo  --  tion as in their dark clenched housing they find themselves pulled up out of the safe muck and tossed into the bucket where , with something like nervousness , they cleanse themselves preparatory to being steamed . I learned to strip the steamed clam ( its shell unhinged in death and rather touchingly thin ) of the rubbery little sleeve on its neck and to plop the whole slippery loose remainder , with its stringy and problematical anatomy , into my mouth . All sorts of squea  --  mishness was teased and goaded out of me in Ipswich , by women who seemed gorgeous and men who seemed knowl  --  edgeable and staunch . I , whose idea of summer bliss had been day after identi  --  cal day at the Shillington playground , with its drowsy rounds of roofball and box hockey and Chinese checkers , learned to play the rich child 's games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , I learned , in the buoyant salt water of the beach and the tidal creeks , to swim , without fear  --  though the thought of sharks did now and then cross my mind and nibble my toes , and , submerged in a friend 's swim  --  ming pool , I would torment myself with the fantasy that I was caught belowdecks in a sinking ship , and must twist my way through narrow , dark  --  ening hatchways to the surface before my lungs exploded . My wife and I found ourselves in a kind of " swim " of equally young mar  --  ried couples , an hour north of Boston and dependent upon each other for entertainment . There was a surge of belonging  --  we joined committees and societies , belonged to a recorder group and a poker group , played volleyball and touch football in season , read plays aloud and went Greek-dancing and gave dinner parties and attended clambakes and concerts and costume balls , all within a rather enclosed com  --  community , so that everything resonated . The sisters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at the back door ; the " gang " was , at last , all here . As a group , we had lovely times being young adults in Ipswich , while raising our children more or less ab  --  sent-mindedly and holding down our jobs in much the same style . My profession of free-lance writer was strange here , but not so strange as it would have been in Shillington . Sev  --  eral publishers , retired and active , were among the grandees of Argilla Road . John Marquand sometimes came down from Newburyport to ap  --  pear at an Ipswich cocktail party , and a number in the genteel older genera  --  tion that had us frisky newcomers in for drinks had published books . Fur  --  ther back , John Wise 's defiant ser  --  mons and Nathaniel Ward 's " Simple Cobler of Aggawam " had been penned THE NEW YORKER 47 in colonial Ipswich , and Anne Brad  --  street had written some of the New World 's first poems a few blocks from where we lived on East Street for thir  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Birthplace of American Independence , " had always been a maverick kind of place ; alone among the major settlements of Essex County , it stood aloof from the witch hunt of 1692 , and turned back the delegation from Salem  --  the legend went  --  at the Choate Bridge . For witches and writ  --  ers , Ipswich was out of harm 's way . I loved it all  --  its authentic depth of history , its great changing marshes and winding odd-named roads ( Tur  --  key Shore , Heartbreak , Labor in Vain ) , its social and ethnic variety , its homely hodgepodge downtown , its ca  --  sual acceptingness of me . I remember early in our days there coming back to the town from several days in New York , to which I still travelled , labori  --  ously , by train ; tired from the seven-hour trip , I walked from the station with my suitcase , on a winter night , up to the high school , where the an  --  nual town meeting was in progress . I gave my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in the door  --  way of the auditorium in my city suit , looking in at the brightly illuminated faces of my fellow-citizens . They were agitated by some thoroughly local is  --  sue on the floor ; my wife and the friends we had made were somewhere in this solemn , colorful , warm civic mass , and I felt a rush of wonder that I had come to be part of this , this lively town meeting sequestered within the tall winter night . It occurs to me now that this was the same crowd as had come to the Shillington gym exhi  --  bition , seen from a different angle . I turned thirty , then forty . My four children went to private nursery schools , then the public schools , and then one by one , for all my secret hopes of their becoming cheerleaders and quarterbacks , they drifted into pri  --  vate education , into the orbit of the North Shore upper class . This class was of no interest to me ; I saw myself as a spy within average , public-school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family to a town , its meetings and elections , its circles and cliques . Like my father I had left my native state and moved to my wife 's region , and , acquiring more financial ease than he ever had , I took perhaps even more pleasure than he in the transactions of a middle-class man with his society , from a joking relation with the brothers who ran the liquor 4-8 store to membership on the church building committee ( at my urging , we had joined the Congregational Church ) and a camaraderie with its jolly Christian stalwarts . In Ipswich my impersonation of a normal person be  --  came as good as I could make it . I choked only when attempting an espe  --  cially hearty vitamin pill , and a stam  --  mer rarely impeded my incessant so  --  ciability . The tunnels  --  tending to pass through the throat  --  between my self and the world were open to traffic . My phobias eased , though I was still not charmed when a daddy longlegs came to assist me as I painted storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost , gruesomely , one leg after another to the wet paint . The existential ter  --  rors that had driven me , after college , in Oxford and New York , to Chester  --  ton and Aquinas , Kierkegaard and Barth , were eased aside by the cooper  --  ative nature , now , of growing older . The couples we knew were also aging , and also had given ever more demand  --  ing and uncontrollable hostages to fortune , and paid rising taxes and suf  --  fered automobile accidents and mid  --  night illnesses and marital woe ; but under the tireless supervision of gossip all misfortunes were compared , and confessed , and revealed as relative . Egotistic dread faded within the shared life . We celebrated each other 's birthdays and breakups in a boozy , jaunty muddle of mutually invaded pri  --  vacies . In " The Late George Apley , " an old Bostonian claims he does n't care where he goes after death , Heav  --  en or Hell , as long as his fellow club members are there . There is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  an assurance that members of tribes and villages have extended to one another for millennia , the assur  --  ance that no earthly adventure , from puberty to death , is unprecedented or incapable of being shared and that one 's life is thoroughly witnessed and therefore not wasted . It was poten  --  tially , terrifying , to advance into time ? every day , a new newspaper on the porch ! ? toward death , but like an army taking comfort in its own massed song and smell we pressed forward . The weekend get-togethers supplied courage to last the week . And there was , in those Ipswich days , for me at least , a raw educational component ; though I used to score well in aca  --  demic tests , I seemed to know wonder  --  fully little of how the world worked SEPTEMBER 2 , 1985 and was truly grateful for instruction , whether it was how to stroke a back  --  hand , mix a Martini , use a wallpaper steamer , or do the Twist . My wife , too , seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our children , we were still taking lessons , in how to be grown-up . FROM April to November , my life 1 ' was structured around giving my skin a dose of sun . In the spring , though the wind off the sea was cold , the sun was bright and the hollows in the dunes were hot . I would go there alone , with a radio and a book , and without benefit of lotion inflict upon myself two hours of midday ultravio  --  let . I wanted to burn ; my skin was my enemy , and the pain of sunburn meant that I had given it a blow . Overnight , the psoriasis would turn from raised pink spots on white skin to whitish spots on red skin ; this signalled its re  --  treat , and by June 1 could prance back and forth on the beach in a bathing suit without shame . To add to my ex  --  posure in those sunny years , I bought convertibles , and would drive back up Argilla Road admiring my red , sting  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in happiness , because normality was on the way ; I had packed in a day 's worth of radiation . In the meantime , my pariahlike solitude in the dunes felt somewhat majestic , amid the sandy immensities back from the beach , before summer had begun , when there were no other persons to be seen but a few bundled dog walkers and perhaps a pair of rid  --  ers galloping their horses along the ocean 's sliding , foaming edge  --  Ips  --  wich Bay , with a broad sandbar a half mile out , rarely admitted surf of any real thump . Once down in my chosen hollow and stripped to the bathing suit I had worn beneath my trousers , I was out of sight , out of the human world indeed . The world of the dunes , in summer too hot to inhabit , in spring still held puddles of snowmelt . The chill wind whipped a white haze from the rippled surfaces of the dunes and , when I laid my head on the towel , tried to fill my ears with sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concussion of the waves on the distant beach and the cry of a gull like a sudden bubble in the smooth blue glass of the sky , the meagre details within my hollow were magnified by boredom almost into omens . The rusted cans and charred driftwood left by a bonfire last autumn ; the circles and half circles that the sharp bent wands of beach grass scribed about themselves ; the te  --  nacious gnarled beach-plum bush that gestured at me from a sandy ridge ; the sand itself , so minutely sparkling and facetted , spilling warmly through my fingers as , lying there sun-stunned , I idly dug down through the dry top layer to the cooler , more stable and secretive moist darkness beneath . Na  --  ture in its starkness and intricacy and uncomplaining monotony enclosed me in my wide trough of sand while a tumble of mauve and gray spring clouds poured by overhead , blotting the sun for resented minutes . At first , it seemed these natural appearances , these grains and leaves and sticks and stubborn xerophytic threads , would speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least like the intelligible tracks the gulls and deer and rabbits left on the dampish floor of the hollow . Lying there in the service of my skin , I had plenty of time to learn a language ; but my communion , for those many sea  --  sons of scorching self-cure , was with an inflexible , if benign , speaker of an alien tongue : Nature pronounced a round , firm word , over and over , but no translation was ever offered as to what the word might mean . It was least stupefying in the dunes if a Red Sox game was on the radio . I had moved to New England , in part , to be closer to Ted ' Williams . But by two o'clock , when the afternoon games started , the healing rays had tipped too far from the zenith . Before two , there was music on the radio , with news on the half-hour . The early-rock overture to the countercul  --  ture sounded , to me , merely noisy ; I longed to hear the mellow saxophones and lilting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music , faded forever from the air  --  waves . There were games one could play , patterns both tactile and visual one could fiddle at while the sun flat  --  tened the brain to a rosy blankness . I would spit , and watch the little blots and balls of mud fade hack into pale , crystalline sand . I would put a stick in the sand to make a sundial . And of course I tried to write and read ; but always with a sense of mental effort and optic abuse that led to faint head  --  aches and nausea . Ultraviolet light , which breaks down the DNA in over  --  exposed skins , also attacks consecu  --  tive thought . Writing is a thoroughly shady affair . The first year in Ipswich , I wrote in a little marble-floored room at the back of the house we rented on Essex Road ; one winter night a storm blew the door open and filled my boxes of man  --  uscript with snow . in the seventeenth-century house that we bought , I worked in a tiny corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Spring Streets , my eyes level with the limbs of a great old elm and the crossbars of an especially compli  --  cated telephone pole . By late 1960 , our fourth child was born , and the house was full of commotion and small emergencies that seemed to invite my participation ; I was surprised when my wife suggested that she was tired of making lunch for me every day and that my presence was not really indis  --  pensable . And so I rented a room downtown , four blocks away . The be  --  ginning rent was eight dollars a week , and my frugal landlord , observing that I did n't sleep there , would turn off the radiator every night , so on winter mornings I would face a room cooled to the right temperature not for writ  --  ing but for running in place , wearing gloves and a hat . In summer , though , what ripeness of life it seemed , to put in a few hours at the typewriter and then race down  --  stairs ( the room was above a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or convertible containing my wife andquartet of children , all plump and brown in their bathing suits ! They would have brought mine and I would change in the car as my wife drove the five miles to the beach . Then , there , to be waved past the ticket booth by its pith-helmeted guardians , who knew us by sight and name , and to proceed to the town lot to which our taxes and beach sticker entitled us , and to park , and unload our lunch basket , our toys , our towels and mats and paperbacks , and to walk down the boardwalk in procession , myself the leader and evi  --  dent support of so much healthy flesh ? what bourgeois , pagan bliss ! In New York City , sallow and spotty , I had gone to the Forty-second Street library 's collection of telephone books and looked down the column of names under Ipswich and imagined myself among them ; now I was here , a citizen in good standing , partaking of the splendid local summer as if entitled since birth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beach between the icy blue sea , which invited only the fanatically hardy in for more than a dip , and the loose white sand beyond the high-tide mark , which burned your feet if you did not step quickly . Along this stretch , beside the water 's edge , was a promenading of friends and strangers , of caramel-col  --  ored teen-agers and middle-aged men with shrunken legs and grizzled bar  --  rel chests , of wasp-waisted homosexu  --  als from Boston and pregnant young brides here for a week of vacation . It was , for me , a matter of pride , a willed achievement , to be among these nearly naked strollers , to be an inconspicuous part of this herd , to be in this humble sense human . jk KIND of fly called the green-head arose from the extensive marshes in late July , in unstoppable SEPTEMBER 2 , 1985 numbers ; this obtuse pest bit , with a curiously hot and malevolent chew  --  ing action , and rendered the outdoors uninhabitable for the first weeks of August . We began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to escape the greenheads and to return , in a sense , to New York , whose literary circles sup  --  plied a significant portion of the Vine  --  yard 's summer people . It was a life in another sort of sun , an all-day sun , enjoyed while reading proof on the porch overlooking Menemsha Bight , or playing tennis on the glaring clay courts at the Chilmark Community Center , or sailing across warm salt ponds to South Beach , where giant heavy waves towered and ( a pale cel  --  ery-green light shining through at the moment of cresting ) crashed in a sportive , challenging way not seen in Ipswich Bay . One dived straight into them or underwent a terrifying tum  --  ble . One took showers in wooden out  --  door stalls and walked naked across the prickly , sandy lawn . The Vineyard was soaked through and through with summer , like an old pine picnic table left outside beside the rusty barbecue grill . There were clay cliffs , and Indi  --  ans , and softball games . The air was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore . Without the incentive of my skin , I would never have pushed my  --  self into this paradise , among Cam  --  bridge professors and Manhattan word merchants  --  most of whom took a bet  --  ter tan than I did . A bit of psoriasis , erased , seems to steal a little melanin away with it ; my skin , always freckled , had developed small freckles of pallor , across the shoulders and upper arms especially , so that , examined closely , it showed the chromatic complexity of mottled lino  --  leum or a Pollock masterpiece . Also , in August , when the summer 's harvest of swarthiness and glow should have been at the heaviest , small hard raised spots would appear : the psoriasis was fighting back . My skin , once so thirsty and grateful for solar rays , and so sensitive to them , had grown tough  --  ened and bored over the years . By November , however many October ' loons I had gone to the beach and forced myself into the bitter blue water and lain there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have become again a cause for self-consciousness ; by January , it was time for my trip to the Caribbean . For my search for superficial perfection had additionally goaded me all the way to the tropics , where an old-fashioned Shillington boy would never have THE NEW YORKER thought to go , where the air , the mu  --  sic , the vegetation , the houses , the ac  --  cents of the people , and their color were all entirely and excitingly differ  --  ent , where even the clouds and the stars presented different formations . For the first Caribbean trip , in the winter of 1960 , we all went  --  my wife and I and our then three children . Elizabeth was in kindergarten , David was three , and Michael , born seven months before , was diagnosed before we left to have feet that needed straightening . Daisy and Selma , the two servants who came with the house we had rented on the island of An  --  guilla , used to pack his squarish , toed-in feet in the sand  --  an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casts he eventually wore . We had thought to spend the entire winter in the sun , and a friend of a friend knew Anguilla to be remote and seldom visited and therefore cheap . We established communication , via frag  --  ile blue air-letter forms that arrived in Ipswich wrinkled and bleached as if by the salt spray and sunshine at their source , with a Mr. Gumbs , who rented us " the Captain 's House , " in the part of Anguilla called Sandy Ground . The geographical divi  --  sions of the island were simplicity it  --  self  --  Valley , Road , East End , West End  --  and the Captain 's House turned out to be the mansion of its modest neighborhood : a solid two-story struc  --  ture of which we occupied the second story only . The lower , of stone and permanently shadowed by our veranda , was occupied by a short dark woman who could be seen spreading her clothes to dry on the bushes around the house and who otherwise broke into our consciousness rarely , but for two occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night Rebecca 's  --  she lived beneath us sailor lover returned from sea and beat her for hours , it was as hard to sleep as the time she tied a rooster inside an oil drum . From the front veranda one looked straight down a kind of grassy road  --  way at the beryl-colored sea and a blunt cement-and-wood structure that served as a quay ; there was no more elaborate dock on the island , and sup  --  plies were rafted in to the beaches . We ate vegetables canned in England and balls of fried dough that Daisy called " bakes " and , for protein , freshly caught fish or some poor scrawny chicken brought alive to us for inspection and then clumsily killed with a machete in the yard . A tiny boy , Hilton , the same age as my Liz , was handed the machete one time by the squeamish Daisy and lie and the chicken had a prolonged time achiev  --  ing the latter 's death , as it raced squawking around the threadbare yard with its half-severed head at an angle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ; in addition to Daisy , the cook , and Selma , the babysitter , there was a handsome boy , older than Hilton , who every morning pumped up water out of our cistern into our holding tank , and Eliot Carty , called Mr. Eliot , who had a Jeep and would give us rides to " town " ? to the " Factory " ( general store ) in Valley . Though at night Sandy Ground became as dark as the jungle , with huge black insects hurl  --  ing themselves against our hissing Lilly lamps and centipedes the size of mice pulsing in the shadowy corners , and though it more than once occurred to me that our mass murder would take a week to make the North American newspapers , we were , I can appreciate now , well looked-after and sustained by the invisible network of this primi  --  tive place . We were the only white visitors on an almost entirely black , undeveloped island , an extreme backwater in the fast-fading British Empire . Once a day or so , a policeman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would whizz down the road . Small children in blue school uniforms would walk their way to and from a school where they learned the British counties and the monarchs of England . Young women would come to the faucet in front of the Captain 's House and fill buckets of water they would carry away on their heads . At night , a boy down the road would practice on his steel drums . For large stretches of the day , nothing at all seemed to be hap  --  pening ; but then the Shillington of the thirties might have looked as dormant and secretive to an Anguillan . The little houses around us , with slat sides and hipped roofs of corrugated iron , generally had their shutters closed . Here and there a roan might be hoeing or a woman hanging out wash while hymns out of Antigua blew from the radio on her windowsill . Across the road , in a large house surrounded by a low fence and with a yard shaded by dusty trees dripping clusters of brown pods , lived the other white people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast stretches of cliff and THE NEW YORKER. several costly wooden schooners at an  --  chor in the bay . But they themselves looked like the underfed , squinting people in Dorothea Lange 's Depres  --  sion photographs , and seemed to have much to hide . One of the brothers was always absent ; the other , who was pres  --  ent , was usually drunk ; of the sisters , one was either crippled or mad and never emerged from the house , and the other sat in her yard , surrounded by fallen palm fronds , and made conver  --  sation in a melancholy singsong . Only the old lady , the matriarch , had a certain bounce to her style , and years later , I heard , when Princess Mar  --  garet visited Anguilla , affronted pro  --  tocol by giving the Princess , in the receiving line , a kiss . All the family had that curious complexion of tropi  --  cal whites  --  a dingy , mat color , the color of sun avoidance in a climate rife with photons . The island had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold those who did come there . On the East End , an old shipwreck had deposited some Scandinavian sailors whose descendants , though still pale enough to shelter their faces with straw hats , seemed otherwise to have forgotten that they were white . I my  --  self had never been among black peo  --  ple before . They were to me almost entirely a myth , though a benign and significant one , starring Joe Louis , Fats Waller , Marian Anderson , and Jackie Robinson . The Negroes of Berks County were ghettoized in south Reading and could be seen from the trolley car as it passed through to Penn Square . A black family , the Johnsons , attended Shillington High , and were admired for their singing ( the girl ) and athletic skill ( the boys ) . When one Johnson boy , however , took a white bride , his house somehow burned down . There was , in this southeast corner of Pennsylvania , including Philadelphia , a certain Southern illusion of a mutually enjoyed apart  --  heid  --  though in doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglass 's auto  --  biography the thrilling escape into freedom takes the form of the short train ride from Baltimore to Phil  --  adelphia . When I worked as a copyboy for the Read  --  ing Eagle , I was shocked to hear an editor bawl out one of his photographers for bringing hack from the city playgrounds too many shots containing " them . " It was my belief , at the age of eighteen , that the United States ' black tenth had contributed much more than its share of what is distinctive and uni  --  versally eloquent in American culture and that realizing full equality for blacks was our foremost domestic pri  --  ority . Nevertheless , however liberal my views , I had no dealings with blacks either as equals or as servants and was shy and nervous with them . At Harvard , there were two blacks in my freshman dorm ; friendly as we white boys all wanted to be and be  --  lieved we were , after freshman year we lost touch , and I later heard that by our junior year both these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the college . And I met no blacks in Oxford , nor in the fifties literary circles of New York , nor in Ipswich . So , as Isak Dinesen grandly puts it in Out of Africa , " " the discovery of the dark races was to me a magnificent enlargement of all my world . " I had the sensation , no doubt subtly racist , of being overlooked and for  --  given as , each noon , with my book and sunglasses and towel , I plodded up the arc of dazzling coral beach , past the patchy tin and wooden houses half hidden behind the bushes of sea grape , to sock my spots with sun . One was as alone here as in the Ipswich dunes . The soft , pale ocean , a few steps away , kept up a lulling slap and hiss of ad  --  vance and withdrawal , and , in front of the high cliff to the left , pelicans dove , collapsing themselves like umbrellas for their long twisting drop to the sea and then struggling back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouched beaks . A few hand-hewn sailing vessels rocked in the bay , and an occasional native walked up the beach ; it was , for the residents of Sandy Ground , a thoroughfare to their homes . We would exchange a syllable of greeting , and I would try not to cringe in shame . White people were so unusual and odd here , I told myself , that my personal unusualness and der  --  mal oddity might go unnoticed . Small transparent crabs lived in the pure white coral sand , and their cautious scuttlings formed another sort of traf  --  fic , once I persuaded myself that , un  --  like the spiders of evil fantasy , they would not attack me . To them , after all , I was huge , and my arrangement of limbs bizarre . I swam merely to wet my skin and speed the therapy , for a vivid island story told of a woman on the cliff who saw children playing on this beach while a huge shark cruised a few yards from shore , in the very shallow water ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plucked them back just in time , as if from the tracks of an onrushing loco  --  motive . No such epic predator made a pass at me , hut , between the sea grape and the sea , the only sunbather on a mile of beach , while the pelicans mo  --  notonously threw themselves toward their glinting prey , I became aware of a possible vantage from which my self-solicitous life was negligible , and my imperfect skin a less than immense matter . Gratefully , I would return to the house around two and wait for the sunburn to well up at drink time , at the hour when Daisy and Selma , hav ing set dinner on the table , would walk home to their own , along a path that a dike miraculously carried right across the big salt pond behind Sandy Ground . And I was grate ful when , in less than a month , my skin had cleared and become as brown as it ever could he , and my beachgoing need be no more than that of my wife and children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dock in the late af ternoon and swim as the shadows lengthened and the black children in their blue uniforms , holding their shoes in their hands , walked home along the beach and the fishermen hauled their dories up on 5 4 the yielding coral sand , so soft and porous it took a footprint inches deep . To be forgiven , by God : this notion , so commonly mouthed in shadowy churches , was for me a tactile actu  --  ality as I lay in my loathed hide un  --  der that high hard pellet , that sus  --  pended white explosion , of a tropical sun . And the sun 's weight on my skin always meant this to me : I was being redeemed , hauled back into mankind , back from deformity and shame . The sun was like God not only in His power but also in the way He allowed Himself to be shut out , to be evaded . Yet if one were receptive , He could find you even at the bottom of a well ; one could hoard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fuse  --  lage 's pastel tunnel , slide far down the lines of longitude , get out , and He would he there , waiting . That sun-softened humid air would hit your face like an angel 's kiss at the airplane 's exit door . There would be puddles from a momentary tropical shower drying on the runway . Inside the ter  --  minal , the black customs officials in their shorts were indolently waiting , and the air was full of black greetings , black languor and laughter , black are  --  mas . Waiting for my baggage to come down the belt , I would unbutton one shirt sleeve and take a peek at my arm . Already , my skin would look better . NTER Anguilla , I returned to the Caribbean every year . St. Thomas and Antigua , Aruba and Sint Maarten/St . Martin , St. Croix and Puerto Rico  --  all were visited , some  --  times with my wife and once ( Tor  --  tola ) with our four children as well , but more often alone , in trips of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit to tide me over to April and my furtive return to the Ipswich dunes . San Juan was easiest to get to , but urban , with a drab , broad beach , and populated by irritable speakers of Spanish . The lit  --  tle islands had the black magic , and the shaggy curved coral beaches one could hide on . St. Thomas was the most Ameri  --  canized and accessible . In those days , there were no direct flights ; you flew over from San Juan in little prop planes whose aisle tilted upward and whose black stewardesses gave you a piece of hard candy to ease the pain in your eustachian tubes . From on high , the water was turquoise , spotted with submerged islands , purplish coral reefs . I arrived at Harry S. Truman Airport , the first time , with no hotel reservation and the taxi took me to the Gate , a small hotel up a steep street near the center of Charlotte Amalie . It was in an old stone building with a big iron gate , curved brick stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steel band played and there was no sleeping until one o'clock . But then I never slept well in the Caribbean any  --  way , what with sunburn and my raw excitement at being there , at having reached the sun . The steel drums un  --  leashed their belling , momentous mu  --  sic beneath my bed and a car with a broken muffler revved under my lou  --  vered window and I was roasting in a kind of heaven , happily hurting in every square inch of skin but what my bathing suit had covered that day . I had the treatment down to a science , after a few trips in which I had burned myself so badly as to lose the next day entirely , wasted , scorched and shiver  --  ing , in my hotel room . On St. Thomas , I would take a taxi or drive my rented V.W. bug to Morningstar Beach or Magens Bay and walk , fully clothed , to the far end , stake out with my towel a spot near some sea grape or a shelter made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and begin to pass the hours . Two hours was about the max  --  imum , unless clouds muddled the ex  --  posure . If I had been there a few days and my skin was half cured , I might be bold enough to walk in my bathing suit down to the beach restaurant and have a hamburger and milk . I almost never talked to anyone , except to ask for food . My solitude was part of the charm of those pilgrimages to the sun , part of the relief from my constant temperate-zone performances as father , party  --  goer , committeeman . Down here , my minor role as a leper became pre  --  dominant , and I did n't want to be touched . My daily stint on the beach SEPTEMBER . 2,1985 behind me , I would wander through the tax-free shops and the local forts with their torpid little displays of old muskets and leg irons . I would walk along the waterfront and marvel at the boats , evidences of that whole other life , full of ropes and cunning brass fittings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that quick tropical dusk , violet and green in color , to descend , so I could go to a bar  --  best of all , Trader Dan 's , the open four-sided bar under a pavilion roof on the Charlotte Amalie harbor and cool my insides with a Daiquiri or two . My chest and legs by now would be aching under my clothes , and it was as if with the rum I were rewarding myself for a good day 's work . Dinner was awkward , alone ; on St. Thomas , I found a cafeteria a few blocks off the tourist track where the locals and I could eat meatloaf and peas off a tray . Then back to the Gate , to wait with a book in my room for the steel band to arrive , its clangorous un  --  packing and jocular jabber and the tentative peals of tuning up . I would go down and sit at the bar alone and drink beers and watch the dancing . In those days the Gate offered the only in-town entertainment ; all the rest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posh beach hotels , out of hounds to the natives who came and paid their dollar at the old iron gate , along with the white college kids and the more adventurous , louder middle-aged tour  --  ist couples . It was a black-and-white crowd , blacker as the night wore on , and the black girls were mesmerizing , doing the mambo with their under  --  stated , utterly certain motions , the feet shuffling back and forth a few inches , the hips swaying no more than neces  --  sary , the torso and head softly , steadily bobbing back and forth in a solemn chickenish kind of urging of the mu  --  sic , which rolled on and on , the so  --  prano pan brighter and quicker than a marimba , and the bass  --  a pair of en  --  tire oil drums , usually played by the band 's fat man  --  shaking the floor like an organ 's " Amen . " I suppose I desired them , those stately rapt black girls , hut , whatever my yearnings , the fact remains that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Caribbean . " It last , I can hear the reader sighing , we 're getting down to it . For of course my concern with my skin was ulti  --  mately sexual , the skin being a sexual organ , and the moment of undressing the supreme revelation and confiding . Yet sexual contentment , whether that THE NEW YORKER of the happily married or the illicitly adored , never reconciled me to my skin or relaxed my wish to improve it ; my war had to do with self-love , with finding myself acceptable , whether others did or not . In the Caribbean , my sublimated drives found release in minor cross-cultural trespasses  --  the purchase of a pair of scissors , for instance , at a downtown sundries store where tour  --  ists rarely ventured ( my own scissors , carried in my briefcase for some edit  --  ing I wanted to do , were confiscated on the airplane as an anti-hijack mea  --  sure and not returned ) , or afternoon walks up into the slopes of Charlotte Amalie where roosters crowed and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in surprised greeting of this wrong-colored wan  --  derer . In St. Thomas one Sunday , I discovered the Lutheran church not too many blocks up from the Gate , all polished wood and black faces inside , with plagues in Danish up near the rafters and in the pulpit a pale En  --  glishman , a Greeneish-looking tropi  --  cal cleric , gnawed by an inner worm . The old walls and pews still smelled of cedar , and the singing , like the steel band , like the sun , enfolded you en  --  tirely . The trips gradually became less ef  --  fective ; some winters , there had to be two , one in December and one in March . In the fall of 1974 , I left my wife and Ipswich . The next fall , per  --  haps because there had been no sum  --  mer on the beach , perhaps because guilt had triggered a metabolic riot , my skin attacked me  --  my face broke out , my shoulders and neck became so encrusted I could n't turn my head without pain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I arrived too late for the high sun , parked my rented car by a little beach near the airport and lay there , as a Catholic in crisis might nip into a cathedral . The good old sensations  --  the pressure of the rays , the slap and hiss of the wa  --  ter , the rustle of the palms , the yield  --  ing abrasion of the sand , the illusion , when the eyelids close , of being en  --  cased in a forgiving red  --  were the same , but my skin failed to react as it once did , with the sunburn that put all the cells , somehow , hack to Go . Per  --  haps I had grown too soft on my skin , using too much Coppertone ; or per  --  haps my skin had grown tougher . In the next days , the sleepy long curve of Magens Bay was as idyllic as ever , and the translucent water as alive with silverfish , and the sands of Morning ? star ( a big new hotel had been erected since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing Eu  --  ropean-skimpy trunks , and the smells of rum and charbroiled burgers drifted out from the bar as they always had , and the black taxi-drivers cracked jokes in the dusty parking lot ; but my psoriasis balked at fading away , though the skin between the spots got freckled and tan . I had used up the Caribbean . At forty-two , I had worn out the sun . PROVIDENTIALLY ( let 's say ) , at this very time , a few blocks from where I was living in Boston , dermatologists at Massachusetts General Hospital were developing the FUVA program , still in the experimental stage . I heard word of it , applied , and was accepted , mostly , it turned out , because my son David had once taken guitar lessons from the chief dermatologist 's son . The doctor directly in charge was an Australian , and his letter offering inc an appointment had the clipped , mini  --  mal elegance , centered on a large sheet of paper , of advisements from the Brit  --  ish revenue service . Those admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the startled expression on the doctor 's face when I took off my shirt , I knew that I had passed . I would not flunk this enlistment . I stripped and , fussily clucking and clicking , he pho  --  tographed my lesions with a Nikon . It was draft exam and swimming lessons and gym exhibition all over again ; but I was nearing the end , I felt , of a long line of humiliating exposures . And in a few months pills and artificial light had done what salt water and sun could no longer do . I was " clear " ? the clearest I had been since the age of six , or three . On Anguilla , Daisy 's young cousin , who was intellectual and had hopes of studying abroad , had once been speak  --  ing to me and cause had arisen to refer to some third party who was white . " He is  --  clear ? " had been his delicate island way of putting it . White is right , clear is dear ; I could now at long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world . And yet , my timid ego wondered , was not my sly strength , my insistent specialness , somehow linked to my psoriasis ? Might it not be the horrible badge of whatever in me was worth honoring : the price , high but not im  --  possibly so , I must pay for being me ? What was my creativity , my relent  --  less need to produce , but a parody of my skin 's embarrassing overproduc  --  tion ? Was not my thick literary skin , human . A psychiatrist , I happen to know , would be bored by these linkages ; by Freudian lights my mother 's failings ( if any ) matter far more than my skin 's . In certain moods even I could put my narcissism in perspective . My eyes saw keenly , my legs moved briskly , my genital equipment worked well enough ; I was in no serious way handicapped . Regarding those people who are , I feel a certain terror and an impatience ; I show small talent for leading the blind and amusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psoriasis has made me hard-hearted and deadened those feelers that sentimentally interact with the rest of mankind . Away from the mirror , I am hard to distress , and uncannily equable . I have been since early childhood caged with my fierce red skin , and all struggles outside the cage  --  that is to say , the general run of human travails  --  are relatively a relief . When I broke my leg and had to have it operated upon , I chiefly remember being pleased that my shins , in that season , were clear and I would not offend the surgeon . With my admission to the PUVA program , I was no longer alone with my skin . The world 's dermatological wisdom had come into the cage with me . In the years since , I have watched my skin fight back . The psoriasis irre  --  pressibly strains against the treatment , breaking out in odd areas like the tops of the feet , the backs of the hands . To my body in its eccentric chemistry pso  --  riasis is normal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppression constitutes a poisoning of the system , of my personal ecology . Not only is my skin , after years of being battered by sunlight , full of ker  --  atotic and potentially cancerous cells but there is such a thing , it turns out , as phototoxicity , which builds up over the years of KIVA , and when it strikes feels like sunburn of the muscles , and chews the skin beneath the epidermis so that it flakes off in little chunks . I watch these developments with a cer  --  tain detachment , at the distance of shared responsibility . I fear that sci  --  ence has done its best for the length of my lifetime ; the little programming error at the root of the disease , like that at the root of arthritis , is too fine for today 's tools . I also fear that when I weaken , when I am at last too ill to go stand in a box of glowing tubes , the psoriasis like a fire smoldering in damp peat will break out and spread trium  --  phantly ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become what I am . In the meantime , one struggles for philosophy , for thoughts that are more than skin deep . What could matter less than the integument a skeleton once wore ? I have had my fun , my children and women and volleyball games . What vain concupiscence it used to be , playing volleyball bare-chested , leap  --  ing high to spike the ball down into a pretty housewife 's upturned face , and wearing tomato-red bicycle shorts that as if casually slid down to expose an inch more of tanned , normal-appear  --  ing bottom , even to the sexy dent where the cleavage of the buttocks begins . I have preened , I have lived . Between now and the grave lies a long slide of forestallment , a slew of duti  --  ful , dutifully paid-for maintenance routines in which PUVA joins peri  --  odontal work and prostate examina  --  tions on the crowded appointment cal  --  endar of dwindling days .
