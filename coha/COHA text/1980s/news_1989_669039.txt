If the point of this trip was to immerse myself in total Elvisness , the moment of moments was coming up . It was late in the afternoon . Out in the casino , hundreds of gamblers were throwing their chips onto the tables . I walked through the empty showroom of the Las Vegas Hilton and opened a door leading to the backstage area . Within moments I was standing in the wings . This was the spot where Elvis Presley would stand each night before striding onstage to the strains of " Thus Spake Zarathustra , " or , as his fans called it , " the theme from 2001 ' . " Presley had performed on this stage more then 700 times-the most he ever appeared anywhere in the world . It is a Las Vegas legend-verified by the showroom ' s captains-that , during those 700-plus performances , he never played to an empty seat . I wanted to walk out onto the stage and see what Elvis had seen . Almost 20 years ago I had first come to Las Vegas with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new then , and Elvis had walked out , tan and smiling and in great shape , grabbing an old wooden guitar from his friend Charlie Hodge and launching into " That ' s All Right , Mama . " Midway through the show he had gazed around the ornate room . He seemed both amused and a little stunned to be there . After all , he had started out in roadhouses and small-town auditoriums . Plastered to the walls of the Las Vegas showroom were fancy gilded cherubs . Elvis had paused , looked up at the cherubs , and said , almost to himself : " We didn ' t have none of them fat funky angels on the wall of Heartbreak Hotel , man . " Now , 12 years after his death , I remembered what that moment had been like . I walked toward the stage from the wings and , unexpectedly , I heard a whirring . The massive , heavy showroom curtain had been in its lowered position . To be helpful , a backstage employee had turned a key , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled all the way to the ceiling , and I was at the front edge of the stage . Out in the huge showroom , workers were putting down tablecloths and arranging chairs . So I stood there , and looked up at the spot where Elvis had seen the angels , but the angels were gone . Elvis was long gone , and so were those fat funky angels . The showroom had been redecorated . I didn ' t stay long . It was just something I had wanted to do , and I walked offstage and back through the showroom . Outside , where people used to stand in line for hours in the hopes of getting a seat , there were three tall , circular glass display cases . In one was a 450-pound bronze statue of Elvis . In another was one of Elvis ' guitars . In another was one of those damn white jumpsuits with the jewels all over it . " Saturday Night Live " had once done a parody about the idea of a concert starring Elvis ' gold lame jacket draped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; here was the empty jumpsuit , a certified Las Vegas attraction . The Las Vegas Review-Journal , that morning , had run an analytical story discussing the question of whether Elvis ' popularity as a Las Vegas peformer might be declining . Reading it over breakfast up in his old suite , I had thought : Well , I would hope so . The guy ' s been dead for 12 years . Still , no less than three Elvis-related shows , starring actors and impersonators , are currently playing on Las Vegas stages . There are Elvis billboards , and Elvis radio ads , and framed Elvis photos in the casinos , right next to photos of living attractions such as Bill Cosby and Wayne Newton . You think about that , and about those silly rumors that swept the country last summer-the Elvis-is-alive rumors-and something becomes clear . In a way , he is still alive-not literally , and not " alive in the memories of his fans . " He is still alive in the paradoxical sense that he was never really alive , at least not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on TV screens or in movie theaters-the same way they see him still . There was a human being in there somewhere-a person-but the videotapes and movies are still available . That ' s as close as most of the world ever got to him . Those flickering images , more than the man who posed for them , were Elvis Presley . I rode the elevator back up to Elvis ' suite . On top of the bar was a sandwich-a sandwich I hadn ' t ordered . I looked : It was a fried peanut-butter-and-banana sandwich . I had to laugh . The maids had told me about Elvis ' " ghost " living in these rooms , and now apparently , as a joke , someone had sent the sandwich up . I turned on the stereo . The volume was high-way too high-and my immediate instinct was that of anyone of my generation who ever had a father who hated the idea of Elvis Presley and his songs : Better turn the music down . It ' s going to disturb someone . But then , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized the absurdity of the situation . Turn the music down ? This is Elvis ' room.  --   --   --   --   --  WEDNEDSAY : Lonesome tonight.
