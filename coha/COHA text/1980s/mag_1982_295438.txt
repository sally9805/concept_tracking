Haig shuttles grimly , the British steam , and Argentina digs in <P> The white Boeing 707 taxied to a stop at Buenos Aires ' Ezeiza Airport , and Alexander Haig stepped wearily out into the glow of television lights . The Secretary of State was nearing the end of an arduous diplomatic shuttle that had taken him some 30,000 miles and was in serious danger of stalling . As he prepared to negotiate yet again , he sounded a familiar theme : " It is clear tonight that the task will not be easy , but what is in play is so important that everyone has to apply all the strength possible to achieve a political accord . " What was in play was nothing less than the threat of war . In personally mediating the crisis over the Falkland Islands , Haig had committed the prestige of his office-and that of Ronald Reagan 's presidency-to a goal of preserving peace . He had also in a highly visible way placed the U.S. in the increasingly uncomfortable and unfortunate position of seeming to be unable to choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government run by a military junta . But that was the unavoidable price of such a mediation effort . <P> As Haig began his talks in Buenos Aires , a 45-ship British task force , led by the aircraft carrier H.M.S. Hermes , entered the South Atlantic headed for the <P> Falklands , the remote British colony that Argentina had invaded a fortnight earlier . Steaming at an estimated 18 knots , the armada was expected to be on station by midweek . Meanwhile , the government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had already stationed four submarines , three of them nuclear powered , inside a 200-mile " maritime exclusion zone " around the Falklands , and threatened to fire on any Argentine ship that challenged the blockade . Argentina must unconditionally withdraw from the Falklands , Thatcher insisted to the approval of 80% of her countrymen , or Britain would fight . <P> Argentina 's military rulers seemed surprised at Britain 's vehemence , and stunned by the nationalistic forces it had unleashed . " The English reaction is so absurd , so disproportionate , " lamented Foreign Minister Nicanor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a science-fiction novel . " The junta had miscalculated international opposition to its invasion and grossly underestimated the risk of war . Its seizure of the Falkland Islands nonetheless remained popular at home . Activist Perez Esquivel , who won the Nobel Prize for his human rights crusade against the government , offered his support to the junta last week , as did an organized group of mothers of Argentines kid naped in a wave of police repression . <P> As the cold southern autumn settled in , the government ordered its 9,000 troops on the islands to dig in for a long siege . According to one senior officer , the Malvinas , as the islands are called in Spanish , were so heavily fortified that the British could never retake them . " If they intend to , " he said , " it will be a butchery . " In the island capital of Port Stanley , General Mario Benjamin Menendez , the newly appointed Argentine governor , was ensconced in the office vacated by Britain 's Rex Hunt .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
