Most incumbents will return , but more contentious than ever <P> The current Congress has been one of the most quarrelsome and rebellious ever faced by a President . The Congress that will emerge from next week 's elections will probably not be much different . Once again , Democrats are almost certain to retain control of both chambers , as they have for all but four years since Franklin Roosevelt was elected in 1932 . Leaders of both parties predict that the Republicans will score a net gain of twelve to 20 seats in the House and two or three in the Senate . But once again , whoever wins the White House will most likely find Congress in the same contrary and independent mood that has confronted Jimmy Carter for almost four years . <P> For one thing , the presidential nominees are expected to have very short coattails , nearly all House and Senate members will have to win on their own . Indeed , some popular candidates may even help Carter or Ronald Reagan take closely contested states . Thus few members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occupant of the Oval Office . Moreover , most Representatives and Senators still regard Carter , even near the end of his first term , as an outsider ; Reagan would initially not be treated much differently . <P> Still , the next Congress will not be a carbon copy of its predecessor . Even if the Democrat vs . Republican lineup does not change much , congressional observers expect the outlook of both chambers to shift considerably to the right . Many Democrats , including liberals , have tried to keep pace with the conservative tide in the electorate . In addition , some prominent liberals may be defeated . Thus the next Congress may resist new spending programs , except on defense , and be more willing to strengthen agencies like the CIA . <P> The Democrats ' nimble-footed move to the right is particularly galling for Republicans , who expected to benefit from the country 's deepening conservative mood . A few months ago , G.O.P. leaders spoke euphorically of winning control of the Senate and perhaps even the House . Now they talk more soberly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some time in the distant future . <P> The congressional elections are once again demonstrating the power of incumbency , which mostly helps the Democrats because they outnumber Republicans 59 to 41 in the Senate and 216 to 159 in the House . Members are boasting openly about funneling federal funds into their districts , while assuring voters that they are eliminating waste in other areas of the budget . Incumbents also benefit from a paradox : while voters consistently seem to distrust Congress as a whole , they usually admire their own legislators . Thus North Dakota 's veteran G.O.P. Congressman Mark Andrews is considered a shoo-in for the Senate seat being vacated by retiring Republican Milton Young . Says a disgruntled Democrat : " Andrews and God occupy the same niche here . " Of the House incumbents , 51 have no opponent , scores face only token opposition , and 95% are expected to be reelected .
