NEW YORK  --  The principal remaining operating arms of the Bevill , Bresler &; Schulman group of affiliated securities concerns were placed in receivership yesterday . Meanwhile , Saul Cohen , the court-appointed trustee for Bevill , Bresler &; Schulman Asset Management Corp. and receiver for two other Bevill , Bresler &; Schulman companies , said losses from the collapse of Asset Management may exceed estimates of as much as $198 million . He wouldn ' t specify a new loss estimate . Asset Management was a participant in the government securities market . In Washington yesterday , staff members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Banking Committee met with investment bankers and representatives of the Public Securities Association to discuss legislation to regulate the government securities market . The session was hastily called after the failure of Asset Management . Congressional staff members said that Public Securities Association officials indicated a willingness to accept some form of federal regulation beyond the Fed ' s monitoring of the 36 primary dealers ' daily trading . The meeting , they said , focused on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) , Energy and Commerce Committee chairman , and Rep. Timothy Wirth ( D. , Colo. ) , who heads the Subcommittee on Telecommunications , Consumer Protection and Finance . That bill would require government securities dealers to register with the SEC and would bring them under the authority of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board , a self-regulatory organization made up of industry representatives . The rules of the board , which would be renamed the Public Securities Rulemaking Board , are enforced by the SEC , the National Association of Securities Dealers and federal banking regulators . Messrs . Dingell and Wirth plan to introduce the measure next week , the staff members said . While the extent of losses from Bevill Bresler remained unclear , it appeared that some creditors , mostly small savings and loans across the country , could have much of their capital wiped out if they can ' t recover assets supposedly held by Bevill Bresler ' s clearing agents . All or nearly all of the creditors are federally insured , however , and therefore their customers ' deposits are protected up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ' s unlikely the troubles ( at Bevill Bresler ) will be able to be contained in the Asset Management group , " Mr. Cohen said . He also said after an initial examination of the company ' s records it appears that a previously reported $65 million loan made by Bevill , Bresler &; Schulman Asset Management to an affiliate now appears larger than regulators originally thought . That in turn would indicate that the losses from the collapse of Asset Management were larger than earlier estimates , he said . Mr. Cohen also said that " there is some evidence that securities held as collateral ( for Bevill Bresler customers ) weren ' t held as collateral . " He said that in the case of one creditor , which he wouldn ' t identify , collateral of " around one million dollars " was supposed to be held by Bevill Bresler ' s clearing agent , Security Pacific Clearing &; Services Corp . But " Security Pacific doesn ' t show it on its records , " Mr. Cohen said . Security Pacific Clearing is a unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company , that bought the Bevill Bresler clearing accounts in March from a subsidiary of Bradford National Corp. , which recently was renamed Fidata Corp . The SEC charged the Bevill , Bresler &; Schulman affiliated companies and their senior officers with fraud Monday , saying that they obtained control of customer securities and used " the proceeds to their own benefit . " SEC officials said that Bevill , Bresler &; Schulman Inc. , a registered broker-dealer mainly of U.S. government and municipal securities , should be put in receivership because of its transactions with other Bevill Bresler firms that have either filed for bankruptcy-law protection or are already under the control of a court-appointed receiver . The SEC made a similar request Tuesday in federal court in Newark , N.J. , but that request was denied by Judge Dickinson Debevoise . Yesterday the judge named Richard Hill , a New Jersey lawyer and former bankruptcy judge , as receiver for the broker-dealer and for three other Bevill Bresler concerns  --  BBS Securities Inc . , Austin Investment Planning Inc. and BBS Securities Group Inc . The appointment was agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bevill , Bresler &; Schulman Inc . Mr. Goldstein said he didn ' t oppose the naming of a receiver , as the companies did Monday , because " given the present state of market conditions , it was difficult to maintain the operation " of the companies . While in receivership , a company can continue to operate , but it ' s under the control of the receiver , instead of its officers . A caller to Bevill , Bresler &; Schulman Inc. ' s discount brokerage office at 500 Park Ave. in Manhattan was told that the company was only executing sell orders , and wouldn ' t carry out buy orders . Brokerage customers of the concern are covered for as much as $500 , 000 by the Securities Investor Protection Corp . Previously , the judge placed under receivership two other Bevill Bresler companies , BBS Government Securities Group Inc. and Bevill , Bresler &; Schulman Government Securities Inc . He declined an SEC request that he also place in receivership Bevill , Bresler &; Schulman Asset Management and instead granted it protection from creditors under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a company while it tries to work out a repayment plan . He did , however , grant an SEC request to freeze that concern ' s assets . He named Mr. Cohen trustee of the Asset Management arm and receiver for the other two . Ira Lee Sorkin , head of the SEC ' s New York office , said that a different receiver was chosen yesterday for the four additional Bevill Bresler companies " to avoid the possibility of the appearance of a conflict of interest " on the part of the receivers . Mr. Sorkin said the SEC is returning to court early today to add two of the affiliated companies  --  Austin Investment Planning Inc. and Bevill , Bresler &; Schulman Securities Inc.  --  to its complaint filed Monday alleging violations of federal securities laws . Judge Debevoise yesterday signed an order freezing the assets of all remaining related Bevill Bresler companies except Bevill , Bresler &; Schulman Inc. and its parent , BBS Securities Group Inc . It ' s now up to Mr. Hill if he wants to freeze the assets of these companies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Bevill , Bresler &; Schulman officials named in the SEC complaint , except for living expenses and attorneys ' fees , for 10 days , at which point the arrangement will be reevaluated . The judge has asked for informal reports from the receivers weekly . All of the Bevill Bresler affiliated companies shared corporate headquarters in Livingston , N.J. , where the firms as a group had an estimated 400 employees . Calls to Bevill Bresler officers were referred to company attorneys , who didn ' t return them . Meanwhile , it appears that the amounts certain thrifts are owed by Bevill , Bresler &; Schulman Asset Management , according to bankruptcy-court papers , are nearly as large as , or larger than , the thrifts ' net worth . If those thrifts incur losses equal to the amounts listed in bankruptcy-court papers , their net worth could fall below the minimum required by federal regulators . That could happen if they were unable to collect the collateral for their transactions held by Bevill Bresler ' s clearing agent . Despite doubts expressed generally by federal investigators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several of the thrifts listed in court papers as unsecured creditors maintain that their collateral is secure and that they therefore don ' t expect to incur losses . For example , Fort Lee Savings &; Loan Association , Fort Lee , N.J. , is listed as an unsecured creditor owed $19. 3 million . That amount is several times the S &; net worth of about $5 million . Its assets are about $200 million , according to Robert Pierson , president . Mr. Pierson said collateral for his S &; transaction is being held by Security Pacific . Security Pacific wouldn ' t comment as to the status of any specific bank ' s or thrift ' s collateral . Great American Federal Savings &; Loan Association , Oak Park , Ill. , is listed as an unsecured creditor in the amount of $30 million , and has capital of about $34 million . Ralph Bellon , vice president and treasurer , said collateral for Great American is being held by Security Pacific and the Fidata unit . He said he doesn ' t expect Great American to incur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Queens , N.Y. , is listed as an unsecured creditor in the amount of $9. 8 million and has capital " in excess of $10 million , " according to its president , Ira Bailey . But Mr. Bailey said Cross County is a secured creditor , with securities valued at $9. 6 million as collateral for securities valued at $8. 5 million it loaned to Bevill Bresler . Mr. Bailey said he has identification numbers for the securities , which he said are being held by Security Pacific , the Fidata unit , and other banks that he declined to identify . Bevill , Bresler &; Schulman Asset Management filed for bankruptcy-law protection when it realized it couldn ' t meet its obligations to customers involved in repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions in government securities . In a repurchase agreement , an investor lends money by purchasing securities with the understanding that the borrower will buy them back at a higher price later . Meantime , the borrower invests the money , hoping to get a higher rate than the repurchase obligation carries . Viewed from a borrower ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Government securities dealers frequently are principals in both repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions . One of the thrifts that dealt with Asset Management , Imperial Savings Association in San Diego , declined to disclose the size of its repurchase agreement with the company . However , a spokesman did say Imperial ' s exposure " might approximate $2. 1 million " if the transaction isn ' t completed . Imperial said that yesterday it filed a demand to the trustee in bankruptcy to complete the repurchase transaction , which will expire Monday . Imperial said a provision of the Bankruptcy Code allows such transactions to be completed . The thrift added that failure to complete the transaction " won ' t have a material adverse effect on Imperial . " Imperial Savings is a subsidiary of Imperial Corp. of America , a savings and loan holding company . Imperial Savings ' assets at the end of 1984 totaled $7. 7 billion .
