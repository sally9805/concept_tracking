Soviet doctors called it psychiatry , but sometimes it seemed decidedly unscientific . For decades , sane Soviet citizens were branded as lunatics because they defied the government . They were hospitalized for years under prison-like conditions and put on powerful drugs that turned them into zombies . Particularly unruly patients were sometimes wrapped in wet canvas and nearly suffocated . As word of such abuses spread outside the Soviet Union , the country 's psychiatrists became outcasts in the international medical community . <P> Now the Soviets have mounted a concerted campaign to regain respectability . While never admitting that Soviet doctors had ever been instruments of political oppression , the Kremlin has released scores of dissidents from mental wards and reformed laws that govern the rights of psychiatric patients . The Soviets have also permitted Western psychiatrists to come to the U.S.S.R. and see for themselves whether mental patients are being mistreated . Those efforts seem to be bearing fruit : last week , the executive committee of the World Psychiatric Association voted to readmit the Soviets , who had withdrawn $ from the organization in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved at a meeting of the W.P.A. 's full membership in Athens next October , Soviet psychiatry will have scored a substantial victory . <P> Last month a team of 26 U.S. mental-health experts made an unprecedented two-week tour of Soviet psychiatric facilities . Armed with a list compiled by human rights activists of present or former mental patients believed to have been hospitalized unjustly , the delegation interviewed 27 people . The American group , which included psychiatrists , attorneys and a psychologist , has agreed not to discuss its findings publicly until the official report on the trip is issued later this year . At a press conference , the only revealing comment from Dr. Loren Roth , the University of Pittsburgh psychiatrist who led the group , was that the two weeks had been " stressful and difficult for both sides . " Nevertheless , there were indications that at least a few Soviet mental patients could still be considered victims of psychiatric abuse . <P> Soviet psychiatry began to take shape in the 1920s and drew especially on the work of physiologist Ivan Pavlov ( whose experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pavlovian response to the English language ) . His followers largely rejected the work of Sigmund Freud and other Western theorists and looked for physical rather than psychological causes of mental problems . That emphasis led Soviet psychiatrists to rely on drug treatment , work therapy and re-education rather than psychotherapy . <P> The practice of classifying dissidents as disturbed was facilitated by the work of Dr. Andrei Snezhnevsky , who was director of the Institute of Psychiatry of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Medical Sciences and who dominated Soviet psychiatry from the early 1950s until his death two years ago . Snezhnevsky considerably broadened the definition of schizophrenia by adding the category " sluggish schizophrenia . " He defined the disorder as a slow- developing illness without the hallucinations that are a classic element in the Western definition of many schizophrenias . Instead , the " symptoms " could be nearly all forms of behavior  --  unsociability , mild pessimism , stubbornness  --  that deviated from the social or political ideal .                    @
