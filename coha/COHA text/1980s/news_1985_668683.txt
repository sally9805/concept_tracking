With the first glaze of fall on the leaves , photographer Anne Fishbein headed her car west on stretches of the now retired U.S. Hwy. 66 . She took her 10-frame Makina Ploubel camera for large negatives , her 35 mm . Leica for flexibility , bags full of film and her plans to photograph life and people along America ' s first interstate highway . No matter that the road has fallen on hard times , been cast from the U.S. highway system and stripped of its signs . It remains a mythical byway of an American dream associated with Jack Kerouac , sleek convertibles and " goin ' West . " A 1960s television series immortalized the highway as Route 66 . It starts at Lake Shore Drive and Jackson Boulevard . It ends in Santa Monica , Calif . Fishbein had a grant from Yale University that covered materials and expenses to photograph Route 66  --  if she budgeted carefully . It didn ' t cover costs such as repairing her old car that broke down frequently during the 4 1/ 2-week drive between Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Northwest suburbs . She stayed with her grandmother in Chicago while she prepared for her trip and combed old maps . She hit the road alone on Sept. 18 . The first day on the road , Fishbein found the " 66 Bar " near Joliet . Near St. Louis , she saw the first of a handful of remaining U.S. Hwy. 66 signs . She followed the road through Galena , Kan. , a picturesque town where time seems to have stopped . She followed it by Ed ' s Camp along a treacherous mountain stretch in Arizona . Fishbein photographed these places , but some days she saw little to relieve the desolate view of a cracking highway with crumbling buildings standing sentinel beside it . These were the worst days , she says . She chalked up lots of miles but few photographs . " You just can ' t bring yourself to take a picture of one more boarded up motel , one more broken down gas station , " she says . She began doubting her project . Her whole identity had to be supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no professor to push for results . The pressure came from within . " It was me against myself , " she says . This is the world of the photographer as artist , defining projects to test the medium and the spirit . Edward Steichen was already a famous portrait photographer when he set out to master " that charlatan , light , and the innate cussedness of inanimate things . " For months , he took hundreds of images of a white cup and saucer on black velvet set in every possible variation of light . Many photographers as artists have similar stories to tell . They seek out departures from their work . They exploit their mistakes , their film , their equipment for visual descriptions of the world . The artists of an earlier generation often learned their craft by trial and error or by finding a mentor in an established photographer . The young artists study photography at college level programs offered by more than 1 , 000 institutions in the United States . Many go on to graduate school . They teach to support their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departments has leveled off in the last few years , they are shooting commercial work as well as fine art . Fishbein has a master ' s degree in fine arts from Yale University and an impressive list of publication credits in magazines and newspapers . Her pictures often capture a poignant sense of irony . She photographed a young couple hugging in front of an abandoned home in Love Canal where life goes on despite the toxic waste contamination discovered there several years ago . A young boy lays near a cratered section of yard in another photograph taken in New London , Conn. , where the local economy centers around the construction of nuclear submarines . Fishbein pursued her portraits of communities and people wherever events in her life happened to take her . But she needed the grant to enable her to undertake a sustained project such as photographing Route 66 . The Illinois Arts Council , the National Endowment for the Arts and dozens of other public and private institutions offer art grants for photography projects . " The starting artist usually gets a project completion grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s young and starving and needs $500 for materials , " says John Grimes , associate professor of photography with the Institute of Design at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago . " To win a Guggenheim or one of the other prestigious fellowships you have to be someone who has proved that $25 , 000 or $30 , 000 is going to be productively used , " Grimes says . Grimes notes that photographers should seek out institutions with an interest in the subject being captured . An ethnic foundation , for instance , may not budget for awards in photography specifically but would be receptive to using grant funds for a photography project about its ethnic community . Fishbein , like other artists , speaks of finding a job that will " give me a salary but allow me to do challenging things with a camera . " She has done freelance photojournalism and says that may be the ultimate answer for her . Meanwhile , she is living in Los Angeles , busy processing the rolls of film taken along Route 66 . She says she hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " intangible essence " of reality will result from it all . CAPTION : PHOTO : Anne Fishbein at the start of Route 66 , on Lake Shore Drive .
