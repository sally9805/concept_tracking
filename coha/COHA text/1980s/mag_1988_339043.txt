They were the waterborne roadsters of the jazz age , built of mahogany , bedecked with nickel-silver fittings , powered by rumbling six-cylinder engines and capable of slicing nose-down through the chop at a brisk 40 m.p.h . But during the late 1950s and ' 60s , the arrival of lighter , carefree fiber-glass hulls persuaded many boat buyers that the rot-prone wooden models were a thing of the past . Gary Scherb , who spent his summers back then working in the boatyards on Lake Hopatcong , N.J. , sadly recalls the time when one of his bosses ordered 40 of the wooden craft sawed into firewood . <P> Today that collection of " woodies , " if restored , would probably be worth as much as $1 million , and Scherb , 44 , is making amends  --  and profits . As owner of Old Time Boat Co. of Sarasota , Fla. , he specializes in lovingly rehabilitating the now precious powerboats of the 1920s through ' 50s . Scherb is currently restoring 18 old runabouts , for which he will charge as much as $500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 woodies in varnished and polished condition for their owners and conducts a growing business as a broker of the vintage craft . <P> As investments and status vessels , antique boats have come of age . The most sought-after models are runabouts of more than 24 ft. in length , which often contain three leather-upholstered cockpits . In mint condition , a runabout built by a prestige manufacturer such as Chris-Craft , Gar Wood or Hacker is worth $60,000 . <P> For boats of that quality , prices are rising at least 10% annually . At the first-ever auction of antique powerboats , which took place in May in Newport , R.I. , a 33-ft . Baby Gar , once owned by Chewing Gum Heir P.K. Wrigley , fetched a bid of $95,000 ; the current owner , Milton Merle , was asking $140,000 and declined the offer . " It 's a one-of-a-kind collectible , " declared Merle , a New York marketing consultant who has amassed a fleet of seven vintage runabouts . <P> A good , unrenovated woody is hard to find . The frame must bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered vintage . Boat brokers and their scouts comb through the backwoods of Michigan , New England , Canada and even Scandinavia in search of suitable craft . The cold freshwater lakes and the long , dry winter-storage seasons in those areas make them prime hunting grounds for well-preserved hulls . <P> Many prized vessels have been found , dust-covered and forgotten , in old barns and boathouses . Scherb , for example , paid $750 for a 1948 Chris-Craft Racing Runabout that had become landlocked inside a remodeled tavern . ( The sellers used the money to pay for a new door to the bar . ) Today , in pristine condition , the Chris-Craft is worth $20,000 . The competition to find such abandoned treasures is becoming increasingly fierce , since the number of still undiscovered boats is estimated to be only 8,000 to 10,000 . <P> Nostalgia is part of the attraction . Richard Tobin , a Miami market-research executive , fondly recalls how he spent his summers speeding around a Michigan lake in the wooden craft . Nowadays he keeps several old runabouts at the same lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Says he : " It 's a trip into the days when our cares were a little bit different . " The most fervent of all collectors is probably Alan Furth , former vice chairman of the Santa Fe Southern Pacific Railroad , who has acquired 61 boats . Over the years he has sold only one .
