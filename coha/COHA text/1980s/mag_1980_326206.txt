THE MOUNTAIN MEN Directed by Richard Lang Screenplay by Fraser Clarke Heston <P> It has been eons since anyone has made a movie like this one , in which white men and Indians endlessly and mindlessly bash away at one another . Scripts about the Indian wars probably do not have to deal with weighty matters like racism , as revisionist film historians insist . But the typical skulk-and-scalp epic today appears feeble even just as entertainment . <P> The Mountain Men concerns a trapper ( Charlton Heston ) who in a battle with a band of Blackfeet acquires an Indian maid ( Victoria Racimo ) . For the rest of the film her Indian master ( Stephen Macht ) and Heston have at each other for possession of the lady , yet the struggle is not developed with much style . There is none of the menace and mystery that attended a similar conflict in Robert Redford 's 1972 Jeremiah Johnson , which also dealt with the trappers who first explored the West . Brian Keith is at his best as Heston 's raffish companion . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He strives to be as free-spirited as a wanderer of the wilderness should be , but the ease that comes naturally to Keith is beyond him . He is a tired act , and this is a tired movie . <P> - By Richard Schickel
