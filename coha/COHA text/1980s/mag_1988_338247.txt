Killing sprees have become grimly commonplace in the U.S. , but last Friday 's horror in Winnetka , Ill. , was particularly searing because the victims were schoolchildren . It began when Lori Dann , 30 , shot and wounded an eight-year- old boy in the bathroom of the Hubbard Woods Elementary School . Dropping one pistol , she entered a second-grade classroom , where she opened fire with another revolver , killing one youngster and critically wounding four others . Dann fled to a nearby household , where she shot one occupant and barricaded herself in the building alone . When a police SWAT team finally burst in about seven hours later , Dann was found dead . She had shot herself through the head with her third gun , a .32-cal. revolver . <P> A native of nearby Glencoe , Dann was suspected by authorities in a 1986 ice- % pick attack on her estranged husband , although she was never charged . The FBI wanted to question her about making threatening telephone calls , and in March she had been picked up in Madison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poisoned food to several homes and college fraternities . She then set fire to a house where she had worked as a baby- sitter , temporarily trapping her former employer and two children in the basement ( they escaped by smashing a window ) . Dann drove six blocks to the school ; she may have been searching for her employer 's other two children , who were away on field trips . Left behind in the bloody school bathroom after the rampage was Dann 's .357 Magnum , for which she had a permit . Asked Winnetka Police Chief Herbert Timm : " How did a woman with that kind of background get licensed to carry a gun ? "
