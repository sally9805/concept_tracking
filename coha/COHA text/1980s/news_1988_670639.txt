One might suggest that this is in contrast to his equally prolific American peers Woody Allen and Neil Simon . Along with Mr. Ayckbourn , they have expressed a desire to be taken - and to take themselves - more seriously . Especially in Mr. Allen ' s case , there is an intention to make a clearer demarcation between the light and the heavy and an unwillingness to work on that middle ground ( the recent " September " is an example of the auteur in a noncomic mood ) . There is , however , no more serious Woody Allen movie than his comedies " Annie Hall " and " Hannah and Her Sisters , " and , for Mr. Simon , " Broadway Bound " is not necessarily more personally revealing than the earlier plays in his autobiographical trilogy. // In contrast , Mr. Ayckbourn ' s dramatic progression has been more organic and intuitive ; it is a matter of gradation . In his previous 30 plays , at least as far back as " Absurd Person Singular , " he has written about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The difference in his three latest plays is that these concerns have moved from the periphery to the basic premise . In " A Small Family Business " ( now in repertory at London ' s National Theater ) , he set out to write about greed , to show how it can corrupt even the most upright citizen , who ends , in this case , as a potential Mafia godfather . With " Henceforward " ( presented earlier this season at Houston ' s Alley Theater and due to open soon in London ) , the author journeys to a fantastic landscape not unlike our own - for a challenging story about the dehumanization of a technologically inclined man , an avant-garde composer who invades the privacy of others as a kind of musical voyeur. // With " Woman in Mind , " the sobering subject is psychosis induced by the desperation within a failed marriage . Mr. Ayckbourn ' s heroine , a vicar ' s wife in a small English community , frees herself from her untenable present by hallucinating an idealized family . Wearing tennis whites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like weekend guests in a Noel Coward comedy . They are the antithesis of , though not the antidote to , her life with her narrow-minded husband , their misfit son and the vicar ' s overbearing sister . For most of the play , the woman ' s tragedy - her happy imaginary life and her dreary domesticity - is treated as a comic aberration , with the emphasis on its ironic content , which is exactly how she regards her own predicament. // As a comic playwright - and even at his most serious , he is a comic playwright - Mr. Ayckbourn colors the descent into madness with humorous observations . He re-evokes familiar Ayckbourn antipathies in new and amusing ways - the hypocrisy that can reside within piety , the double-edged nature of generational estrangement , and , funniest of all , incompetence in the kitchen . The vicar ' s sister , the designated housekeeper , is unable to perform the simplest cooking task , unwittingly serving up a " burnt Earl Grey omelet " to the flabbergasted company . The scene recalls similarly hilarious eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room confrontation in " The Norman Conquests . " Parenthetically , food is also common ground for comedy for Mr. Allen and Mr. Simon. // Even at her most anguished , the heroine of " Woman in Mind " can ridicule her own mental unbalance . We see the events through the myopia of her mind , as the author counterpoints and interweaves the actual and the imaginary , with one repeatedly impinging on the other . The play concludes not with laughter but with poignance . As the woman stares woefully at her interior chaos , the scene begins to resemble the Mad Tea Party in " Alice in Wonderland . " In each of Mr. Ayckbourn ' s last three plays , comedy ceases as we realize the horrifying extent of the central character ' s entrapment , in the case of the other two comedies , his self-entrapment. // " A Small Family Business " begins engagingly as the equivalent of a British situation comedy , about the interwoven activities of relatives of several generations , who , as the title indicates , are all somehow involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatening . In searching for the source of insidious corruption , the entrepreneur discovers - to his dismay - that it is all family-inspired , not-so-petty thievery that has turned the business into a termite ' s nest of deceit . Gradually he realizes that he has no choice but to jettison his code of morality. // Though it has a far more outlandish setting , " Henceforward " also has its sitcom aspects . The through-line of the plot is the composer ' s quest to win custody of his daughter from his estranged wife . The background for this story is a cybernetic nightmare as the composer hides in a bunker and walls himself off from a marauding horde of Amazons , and , in so doing , blockades himself against the possibility of any warmth and affection . In this increasingly depersonalized world , he inevitably loses his own humanity ; he begins to seem robotic. // Most personalized of the three , the woman in " Woman in Mind " can no longer depend on her inner voices as sanctuary . As in the concurrent Ayckbourn plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully satisfied by Stockard Channing , who movingly synthesizes the contradictions within the character . Without admiring all of the character ' s actions , we are drawn to her in her helplessness . In one startling scene , the voices of the fantasy figures suddenly shift from character to character until the entire stage seems possessed . The look on the actress ' s face is one of amazement turning to terror . It is as if the earth had slipped out from under her . In this and other ways , Ms. Channing paints a richly detailed portrait of what could be called deserved dementia . As she also demonstrated in the revivals of Peter Nichols ' s " Day in the Death of Joe Egg " and John Guare ' s " House of Blue Leaves , " she is one of our finest stage actresses , and one who is equally convincing in both English and American roles. // Led by Ms. Channing , Lynne Meadow ' s production may be the one to shatter the myth that Mr. Ayckbourn ' s plays have no home on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishmen , the director strikes an unself-conscious mid-Atlantic tone . The production , however , is unable to overcome the caricatured aspects of some of the characters ( the fantasy figures as well as the vicar ) . The vicar is so irredeemably self-involved that , to the end of the evening , one wonders why his wife ever married him. // In addition to the leading actress , there are precise characterizations by Patricia Conolly as the sister-in-law ( who has mysterious visitations of her own ) , John David Cullum as the son , and , most amusingly , Simon Jones as the kindly but ineffectual doctor who is like a figure dreamed up by Lewis Carroll . Though " Woman in Bind " is one of Mr. Ayckbourn ' s more disturbing plays , it is filled with his wry sense of absurdity - and is a sign of his increasing mastery of the art of seriocomedy. //
