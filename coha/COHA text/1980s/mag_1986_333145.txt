Several Middle East governments , including Libya , Syria and Iran , have long been suspected of smuggling weapons and bombs for terrorists into Europe in sealed diplomatic bags , which according to tradition are not opened for inspection by the host country . Italy , a country hard hit by terrorism , last week announced a new policy : from now on all incoming diplomatic bags will be screened by metal detectors . <P> Customs officials will check the bags at Rome 's Leonardo da Vinci Airport , where almost all diplomatic mail arrives as air freight . Eventually , provisions will be made to inspect pouches arriving by sea , train or automobile from third countries . The metal detectors , however , have one major flaw : they can not detect whether any plastic explosives are packed in the diplomatic pouches .
