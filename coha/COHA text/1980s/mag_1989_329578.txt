Imre Pozsgay , 55 , is the newborn Hungarian Socialist Party 's leading reformer and its candidate for presidential elections scheduled for next month . In his Budapest office overlooking the Danube , Pozsgay was interviewed by TIME 's Eastern Europe bureau chief John Borrell . Excerpts : <P> Q. <P> In the electorate 's eyes , is there such a thing as a reformed Communist ? <P> A. <P> We are not going to have an easy time in the elections . Unlike Poland , where there was a prior agreement dividing up the seats , we are going to have a real struggle , rivalry and competition . We have already said we will accept what the people say . But the reformers have always been open in their approach and in contact with the people . <P> Q. <P> Look what happened in Poland , even to Communist reformers . Is it not possible that the electorate may reject the reformers in Hungary too ? <P> A. <P> It can not be excluded that the same thing could happen here . We must keep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is out to punish the Communist Party . <P> Q. <P> If you win many votes , what are the implications for the rest of Eastern Europe ? <P> A. <P> It will have a positive impact on Communist parties in neighboring countries . It is going to strengthen their reform wings and help the Soviet Union 's own perestroika . <P> Q. <P> But only if it works ? <P> A. <P> Yes . If it fails , there will be catastrophic repercussions . <P> Q. <P> In the sense of discouraging reform elsewhere in the East bloc ? <P> A. <P> Yes . The failure of the reformers in Hungary will help the conservative ( ( hard-line ) ) forces in other socialist countries . Reform is unavoidable , but it can be temporarily halted . <P> Q. <P> What about Hungary ? Is it too late to use force ? <P> A. <P> There are people who would like to do it . But given the lack of support among the people and the fact that the international situation is not favorable for such an attempt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Why did Communists the world over take so long to recognize that their principles were wrong ? <P> A. <P> Resistance to this recognition lay within ourselves . It was hard to recognize that we were in a dead-end street or that what we were protecting was not socialism but dictatorial state socialism . <P> Q. <P> Is the West doing enough ? Or is it letting Eastern Europe 's reformers down ? <P> A. <P> It is not really letting the reformers down . But a destabilized Eastern Europe carries dangers for the West as well as for us . What we need is an influx of working capital and the economic freedom of movement that would allow Hungary to participate in the marketplaces of the European Community and of the U.S. <P> Q. <P> What happens if Western countries do n't help enough ? Will Eastern Europeans leave and head for the West ? <P> A. <P> It is quite possible that this might come to pass . We hope it wo n't , and I trust there wo n't be a mass exodus of Hungarians . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
