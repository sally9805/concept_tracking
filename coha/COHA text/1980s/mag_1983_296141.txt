Comprehension is the big problem with Presidents and the American people when it comes to Latin America and the potential for trouble . When one party believes , the other seems to scoff , and there is something in the U.S. 's mind-set that rejects the idea of a serious threat from any nation so close , so poverty-stricken and , as folklore would have it , so naturally inefficient . <P> United Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick , talking the day after President Reagan 's address before Congress on the Central American crisis , suggested that this nation still suffers from " a cultural snobbery " about that part of the world . Our hemispheric security was taken for granted for decades . We quite naturally were attracted only to struggles with big countries , big armies , big bank balances . Few , claims Kirkpatrick , even thought a place like Nicaragua was very " interesting . " By chance she was speaking in the Roosevelt Room at the White House , her back to the huge oil portrait of Theodore Roosevelt , resplendent in his Rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said his charge at Kettle and San Juan hills in Cuba was " the great day of my life " and the dispatch with his revolver of a fleeing Spaniard was notable because the Spaniard doubled over " neatly as a jack-rabbit . " It was Roosevelt , of course , who bragged as President he " took the isthmus " for the Panama Canal as if it were a pawn on a chessboard . <P> Modern geopolitics and warfare changed the governmental attitude . Franklin Roosevelt understood the strategic importance of Latin America during World War II . Harry Truman endorsed those ideas . Dwight Eisenhower was humiliated by Fidel Castro 's Marxist government , and Ike planned the Bay of Pigs , which John Kennedy launched and bungled . For all of that , rousing this nation to any deep and lasting interest in Lathi America was impossible . Even with rumors flying around Washington in the summer of 1962 about the Soviet buildup in Cuba , Kennedy was only half listening , although he ordered U-2 surveillance that discovered the offensive missiles in October . But all along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Soviet Union it would be in a traditional place like Berlin with traditional air and land confrontations . " If we solve the Berlin problem without war , " Kennedy told his aide Ted Sorensen one September night , " Cuba will look pretty small . And if there is a war , Cuba wo n't matter much either . " But Cuba turned out to be the place and America the intended target . <P> It is oddly reversed now . The President is the concerned party , and Congress and the American people seem reluctant to get involved in Central America , acting sometimes as if the difficulties there will once again fade away if we ignore them . <P> Kirkpatrick says we can not take the old route . The issue is now of " capital importance " to this country . She does note a grudging but significant change in the debate that could signal some deeper sensitivity and a realization of the importance of Latin America . Only a few months ago , she says , few people were talking about another Marxist state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even missiles into the area . Now nobody really dismisses those possibilities .
