Despite claims by Oil Minister Ali Akbar Moinfar that Iran still is pumping 2. 7 million barrels a day of crude ( against government plans for 3 million ) , a top executive of the National Iranian Oil Company ( NIOC ) in the Khuzestan oil fields admitted that crude production had fallen to 1. 8 million barrels a day. // Khuzestan , a steamy province bordering the Gulf , contains most of Iran ' s huge oil and gas reserves . The area recently has been struck by bad floods that submerged many villages and thousands of square miles along the Tigris River . However , officials at the state-run NIOC there claimed that flood damage was only temporary and hit the Abadan refinery much harder than it did oil-field operations. // NIOC officials also denied persistent petroleum-industry reports that the production drop was caused either by the departure of foreign experts after the Shah ' s overthrow or acts of sabotage by Khuzestan Arabs who , like the Kurds and other ethnic minorities in Iran , are fighting for greater autonomy. // Instead , Iranian authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new Islamic government ' s hawkish pricing policy. // Foreign sales out of that 1. 8 million barrels of crude amounted to only 985 , 000 barrels a day for the last week of February  --  far below the 2 million barrel export level officially announced by the NIOC . At that rate , Iran just barely covers its existing crude contracts with British Petroleum , Shell International , Japan , and Brazil , leaving only a small amount to sell on the international spot market , where oil traders are tacking on an extra $2. 50 a barrel to the standard price. // Oil brokers in London suggest Iran may be holding back production until spot-market prices once again shoot up into the $45 a barrel price range that exporters were charging last December during fears of an oil shortage. // Now crude goes for $10 less than that , around $35 a barrel on the Rotterdam spot market . As Prof. Peter O ' Dell , a petroleum marketing expert in Rotterdam explained , " The spot market is so fat right now that the loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Shah was toppled , Iran ' s capacity approached 6 million barrels a day , an export level ranked second only to Saudi Arabia ' s . But as Dr. Hassan Fatemi , NIOC ' s vice-Chairman of operations for Khuzestan , said , " We could easily open the throttle and push production to 4 million barrels , but why should we ? At the current prices , Iran is already making more than enough money. " // In fact , th revolutionary government can not spend its oil revenues fast enough . Since the Shah ' s ouster , over $12. 6 billion has been allocated to development . But Tehran economists estimate that only half of that sum has been pumped into badly needed agricultural and labor-intensive projects. // The politically fractious ruling Revolutionary Council is still bickering over long-term development priorities and also fears that dumping too much cash too fast into the country ' s stalled economy would boost Iran ' s inflation even higher . While crude prices stay sluggish , Tehran has no need to gear up production. // The flooding in Khuzestan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut NIOC ' s huge Abadan refinery intake by 80 , 000 barrels a day . However , Ahmad Rafieyan , assistant manager at the Abadan refinery , claimed repairs were finished " two to three days " after the accident , enabling the refinery to return to its previous 600 , 000 barrels-a-day production. // Peak capacity for the refinery , which produces 100 different petroleum-base products  --  everything from aviation fuel to bitumen for tarring highways  --  is 640 , 000 barrels a day , Mr. Rafieyan said. // Otherwise , the only other damage caused by floods was to new drilling. // During 1980 , Iran plans to drill a total of 11 new wells , using equipment abandoned by foreign contractors during the revolution . US drilling companies had 40 new rigs under way in early 1979 whn Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ended the Shah ' s 37-year reign . NIOC officials claim that flooding has not affected the flow of crude pipelined out to the supertanker terminal at Kharg Island. // NIOC ' s oil-field installations have also been the target of sabotage by a shadowy guerrilla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Khuzestan to break away from Iran . Since January , small guerrilla groups stealing across the Tigris River from Iraq have struck repeatedly , blowing up pipelines and the company ' s communications towers , Dr. Fatemi said. // At his Ahwaz headquarters , 100 miles from Abadan , Dr. Fatemi gestured to a map of the oil fields . " Most of the explosions have occurred on the pipelines running down the border from the Dehluran field . Iraq seems to be directly behind these attacks. " // The Dehluran field extends across the border and Iraq also pumps oil from there . As Dr. Fatemi added , " Every barrel of crude that Iran lifts means less for Iraq . That ' s why they ' re trying to stop us. " // However , Dr. Fatemi admitted that behind the bombings was someone who knew the NIOC ' s operations , possibly a local employee angered by the fact that Khuzestan ' s Arab population only totals one-quarter of NIOC ' s work force. // Iraq has a motive for arming the disgruntled Khuzestan Arabs . The government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while most Iraqis belong to the Shiite sect of Ayatollah Khomeini . A successful Iranian revolution might sweep across the border and topple the Hussein regime. // Iraq knows that Ayatollah Khomeini ' s revolution can only succeed if there is a steady flow of crude to pay for imports until the stalled Iranian economy starts up again. // But can Iran maintain its 1. 8 million level ? Even this comparative trickle may be reduced , say industry experts in Europe who claim that the loss of highly sophisticated foreign maintenance crews has caused many of Iran ' s wells to silt up . NIOC ' s assistant oilfields manager denied this. // " Sure , we need the service companies like Halliburton and Dowell Schlumberger . But at our current production , Iran can hold **28;90; off <> another one or two years without them  --  or their spare parts , " Dr. Fatemi said. // Foreign experts are needed for Iran ' s new petroleum-industry projects , such as construction of a refinery near the huge natural gas field called the Pars Namak-Kangan , further south on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " from the proposed refinery back into the country ' s four main oil-bearing formations , Ahwaz , Abha-jari , Gaschsaran , and Masjed-e-Suleman. // By gas reinjection , NIOC , which , under current technology , is only recovering 30 percent of known reserves , can raise its recovery ratio another 10 to 15 percent. // NIOC officials are saying privately that once the Majlis ( national assembly ) is voted in March 14 , discussions will resume to bring a limited number of foreign companies quietly back into the oil fields. // In Tehran , Western diplomats claim that the biggest threat to the flow of Iranian oil is not the problem of spare parts or sabotage , but a different kidn of time bomb  --  the violent political and ethmic rivalries , which could easily splinter Iran into warring provicnes. // If factions opposing President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr , such as the Mujahideen and the Fedayeen , are dissatisfied with the Majlis elections , they may decide to bring down the government through widespread strikes and demonstrations. // NIOC officials claim that both these Muslim extremist groups are recruiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , Iran ' s petroleum industry may be their first target. // //
