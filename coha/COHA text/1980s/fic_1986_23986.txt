THE REAL STORY By Pamela Painter t starts simply enough I when the son , back from a volunteer job abroad with Vietnamese refugees , discovers that he has become a minor character in one of his father 's novels . In Chapter 10 the " son " returns from the " Peace Corps , " sleeps a lot , and makes exits and entrances talking of El Salvador  --  not Vietnamese refugees . " So this is how real people and things are transformed into fiction , " the young man says to his father after reading the father 's manuscript . They are in the father 's downstairs study . " Real ? One never knows another human being that well , " his father says , leaning back in his chair , closing the subject . Nevertheless , the son determines to read more of his father 's work , and his mother 's too . His parents ' library and files are illuminating . He discovers he has lived with them in fiction , in various permutations , for a long time . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman seems cheered to have him home again and helps him clear out the storage space over the garage . There he sets up shop . The first story he writes is about a son who returns from the Vietnam War to discover that his parents , both writers , have used material from his letters , from his life  --  the mother in stories and the father in a novel . " But we would n't do that , " his parents say , when he shows them his manuscript for comment . " How could you write such a thing ? " The parents follow the son to his study over the garage , where they all sit on orange crates . The son begins addressing SASEs . " You wrote about a kid who thinks the laundry is washed in the laundry chute , " he accuses his mother . " But it was so funny , " she says , trying not to smile . " And there 's a son in your latest novel who Pamela Painter is the author of Getting to Know the Weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees before deciding he wants to be a garlic farmer . " " You 're not a garlic farmer , " his father says . " Maybe you should be a poet , " his mother says . The mother 's next story is about a brilliant young poet who writes mystically about nature and its life cycles , yet refuses to " examine " his two years in Vietnam . Critics wait expectantly for a decade . Finally , as the poet is dying of something related to Agent Orange , it is revealed that he has been writing about Vietnam ever since he returned , but only on the walls of buildings , the seats of subway trains , the tiles of public bathrooms . Instantly , scholars find themselves with a new terrain . Bespectacled , bearded men and lank-haired young women armed with Nikons begin the task of gathering his epic graffiti poem . Each " line " is numbered . He used a red magic marker . His scrawled lines are spotted in Albuquerque , Peoria , Memphis ; he has been everywhere , Bangor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the poet 's last words . The hunt intensifies . Female scholars claim discrimination and demand escorts into the men 's johns . This indignity ends the story . " Just because I have n't written about Vietnam yet does n't mean I 'm not going to , " the son says to his mother in her study , where her black Underwood typewriter rests on an old sewing machine . " Of course you will write about Vietnam , " his mother says . " But you had such a normal childhood . My poet is an orphan . " " A Normal Childhood , " the son 's next story , tells of a boy of nine who reads his mother 's journal , which indirectly recounts a series of affairs she has while he is growing up , all with men closely associated with his father : his dissertation adviser , his squash partner , his dentist , his star graduate student . But the writing in her journal is so oblique that it is n't until the boy has his first sexual experience that he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has come of age . The story is accepted immediately by his father 's old editor . His parents uncork a bottle of Piper-Heidsieck to celebrate this first publication . Even the cleaning woman is given a glass . But later that night the son overhears the mother angrily assert that since she did n't have any affairs , their son must be writing about his father . She asks her husband if , in addition to having affairs , he also wrote them down for the scrutiny of future biographers . " You know I think journal writing depletes creative energy , " the husband says as he undresses . " Affairs do n't ! " she says . Her husband ignores her . Shaking his head he says , " That kid . Did n't he write a great sexual-awakening scene . 0 : the wife writes a story about a woman who understands her husband 's sexual inadequacies only after she finally meets his mother , who chatters about the unusual methods of discipline she employed to stop her son from wetting his pants . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little girl and sent him out on the front porch for all the neighbors to see ( those she alerted by phone ) , and how he later had hormone treatments for undeveloped genitals and late-staying baby fat . When the wife 's story is published the husband storms into his wife 's study , pounds on her Underwood . " I resent your using painful details from my childhood . " " But after all the affairs you 've had , no one could possibly think the man with the sexual problems is you , " his wife says , already at work on another story . She writes them in two to four hours , which makes both her son and her husband nervous when they compare the day 's output over dinner . But she , she reminds them  --  she works on her stories for weeks after . And your mother , thank God , lives in New Mexico and never reads a thing . " In the husband 's next story , his first in several years , a man is married to a woman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , which the reader knows , but the increasingly distraught and suspicious wife proceeds to become a master domestic spy . She draws up elaborate charts and graphs for his meetings , his out-of-town trips . She charts gas receipts , restaurant checks , long-distance calls . These " clues " are color-coded by both paper and ink , and soon the wife begins to think of the charts as works of art . A select committee at the Institute of Contemporary Art actually admits a chart titled Infidelity #4 to a juried exhibit . Finally , in a cataclysmic scene , the wife is confronted by a museum guard as she is adding another name , " Gloria , " to the collage . " Why do n't you stick with novels , " the wife says , barging into her husband 's disheveled study , an open New Yorker in her hand . He whispers something into the phone and quickly hangs up the phone , but she ignores this . She points to the thin shiny column of prose . " How dare you . Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charts kept me away from my work for two whole years . " " It was a detail I could n't resist . There are those , I have discovered , " the husband admits sheepishly . " Besides , friends know you 're not crazy . " " Your affairs are real . " " But only your psychiatrist saw your charts . " Her psychiatrist is a closet writer with three novels in his bottom drawer . He plans to use a pseudonym , not because he might be breaking his Hippocratic oath by revealing his patients ' secrets ( which he is ) , but because he does n't want to disturb his patients ' progress by introducing a personal side of himself into their lives . In fact , he has an irresistible temptation to write about a wife 's  --  he changes it  --  a husband 's elaborate system of charting the suspected course of his wife 's affairs as if they were stock market fluctuations . It rings familiar . Commodities ? No . He makes the husband an oil tycoon obsessed with fat phallic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their locations appear as blue pushpins on his eight-color topographic map of Texas . Red pushpins represent his wife 's gas receipts , her platinum American Express card bills , her extended visits to the ranches of rich Texan relatives . ( Alliteration pleases the psychiatrist . ) Then the psychiatrist calls a patient who is a writer ( the free-association of this escapes him ) and asks for the name of her agent . " Jesus , my shrink called me for an agent . He says he 's beginning to write fiction , " the mother complains to a friend . She cancels future appointments , risking writer 's block , but her anger has energy . Consequently her next story is about an analyst whose most interesting patient is a writer of stories that appear in Esquire , the Atlantic , Playboy . Soon this writer realizes that the analyst is not treating him but rather his characters  --  the flat ones on some glossy page . In their sessions , the analyst asks the writer to explain : why a father reveals a daughter 's real mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why a woman creates a second set of journals when she suspects her husband is reading the first ; why a criminal , given a new identity through the government 's witness protection program , leaves clues as to who and where he is , even though it means certain death . " Where do these stories come from ? " the analyst asks . Enraged , the writer retaliates by writing a story about a patient who poses as a transvestite in order to seduce his analyst and bring about his downfall . At their next session , just after The Couch " has appeared , the writer and the analyst agree to part ways . " Why else would a father say a thing like that  --  accusing the son of using his name . " Suddenly he looks at his father with curiosity and false enlightenment . " I am not dying , " his father says . " The answer is no . " But it makes the father think . In the next five weeks the father finds a new well of creative energy and begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teenage years , his marriage , and his lovers . He loves his son , his wife , but he loves immortality more . He will preempt the biographers , the memoirs of a wife and a son , by telling more than any son or wife could ever imagine . All his life he wrote fiction in order to tell the truth , but now he will write the truth in order to avoid becoming a fiction . His latest affair is allowed to wither and he instructs the cleaning woman to screen all his calls . The son must do his own editing ; his wife has stories of her own to write . He retreats to his study . Furthermore , the cleaning woman is expressly forbidden to disturb a thing in his study . " Come to think of it , " the husband tells her , " you really need n't clean it again at all . " The cleaning woman , of course , takes offense . She also has been taking notes for years , ever since she heard some writer ask on All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by cleaning women ? " She 's ready to quit . They have ceased to surprise her , this quasi-famous family ( her vocabulary has improved while cleaning their toilets , changing their sheets , baking their casseroles ) . She has enough material : habits , plots , lines of dialogue ; the charts and graphs of adultery ; the son 's letters from Thailand ; the husband 's wimpy affairs ; the line " My shrink called me for an agent . " She tells her employers she wants to work only part time because she has other things to accomplish . Somehow , and truth is stranger than fiction , she finds a job with a therapist who fancies himself a writer and has all the books on technique  --  books the family used to ridicule  --  next to Freud . She makes sure before taking the job that he never locks his files . There is an efficiency about all this the missus often accused her of lacking . But she feels efficient as she assembles her cast of characters . Heavily into symbols , she begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scilly Isles , a place that had no industry and where the people had to make do by taking in each other 's laundry . An island setting appeals to her . Three famous writers all live under one red-tiled roof , in a white stucco house overlooking a cerulean sea . Mother , father , son  --  and of course the cleaning woman . It will be a roman a clef . She types on an old typewriter the family gave her , gave her the way folks always give things to the help .
