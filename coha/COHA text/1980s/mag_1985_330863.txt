LIVING WITH THE KENNEDYS : <P> THE JOAN KENNEDY STORY <P> by Marcia Chellis <P> Simon &; Schuster ; 240 pages ; $17.95 <P> Joan Kennedy was once the nation 's leading candidate for Wronged Woman of the Year . Long-suffering , she stood by her husband during the dark hours of Chappaquiddick . Although her marriage was deteriorating , she loyally stumped for Teddy during the 1980 primaries . It was not easy to stop being a Kennedy : the family exerted a powerful gravitational force . <P> As this sad biography shows , the perks were lavish but the emotional cost prohibitive . Joan , an upper-middle-class girl from the suburb of Bronxville , N.Y. , paid for her real and imagined humiliations by becoming an alcoholic . Much of her story , as told by former Administrative Assistant Marcia Chellis , deals with victory over the bottle . There are references to the Senator 's compulsive rovings , Joan 's search for a more attentive man ( " I need a man in my life and I do n't just mean ' safe ' men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " frozen lobster newburgh , creamed chicken , diet root beer , Tab , and Dr Pepper " ) and a bit of advice about cosmetic surgery attributed to Sister-in-Law Jackie : " First the eyes , second the face , and third the boobs . " But the book 's real scandal is one of betrayal , by Chellis . Joan Kennedy apparently believed that her book was to be an inspirational story about recovering from alcoholism , not an airing of family iniquities that were supposed to be held in confidence . <P> RANSOM <P> by Jay McInerney <P> Vintage ; 279 pages ; $5.95 paperback <P> Jay McInerney 's first novel , Bright Lights , Big City , assumed cult status within months of publication . Its second-person narrative , cast of cocaine- fueled yuppies and New York City nightclub scenes had an odd , ironic charm that made some 138,000 buyers eager for his next tale . This time the protagonist has upward immobility but no interest in drugs . In fact , Christopher Ransom , an American drifter in Kyoto , has only one enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cowboy store , and tries to regain his spiritual bearings with martial arts . Ransom also wants to avoid memories of a girlfriend who ODed near the Afghan border , and the presence of his Hollywood producer-director father . McInerney has an unfortunate penchant for Christian metaphors , and his story is heavy with meditations about redemption . A pity ; the rest of the way he is as good as the pre-Garp John Irving . All McInerney needs , like his heroes , is to grow up a little . <P> DANCING IN THE LIGHT <P> by Shirley MacLaine <P> Bantam ; 421 pages ; $17.95
