But the source of the problem lies hundreds of miles away - up the Elbe River in the heart of East Germany and Czechoslovakia . It ' s there , say West German officials , that factories and towns dump most of the wastes which get carried down-river into Hamburg. // The Elbe highlights how tough it can be to get East and West to cooperate on cleaning the environment. // // ' ' Unfortunately , almost all the streams in Europe flow east to west , ' ' says one West German official. // In the case of the Elbe , this means massive problems for West Germany . The Elbe is one of Europe ' s dirtiest rivers - with a drainage basin that includes the most heavily industrialized corner of Czechoslovakia and most of East Germany . Every year , more than 20 tons of mercury are washed down the river , about seven times the amount carried by the much larger Rhine. // When the Elbe broadens into Hamburg ' s network of waterways , it slows - depositing sediments laced with mercury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // That ' s where Hamburg ' s troubles begin . The city dredges about 1 million tons of mud annually to keep shipping channels open . The material once was used to fill marshland or fertilize fields , but this is no longer safe . The dredge piles themselves are now a hazard - since pollutants from the mud can leach into groundwater. // Officials are scrambling to find some way of disposing of the stuff , but admit they ' re facing a crisis . In an ironic twist , the West Germans are negotiating shipping the material to East Germany for disposal . The East Germans would get hard currency from the deal . ' ' We always have to keep the option open to ship the material abroad , ' ' says Harald Gohren , assistant director of Hamburg ' s harbor authority , which oversees dredging operations . ' ' But we hope we don ' t have to do that. ' ' // And the problem doesn ' t stop in Hamburg . Only about one-third of the river ' s wastes get snared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Sea . That body of water is the focus of growing international concern because of the damaging effects pollution already has had on wildlife in the area. // And so the pressure is on to attack the problem at its source. // All three countries involved say they want to clean up the Elbe . But a mesh of economic and diplomatic problems has made progress difficult. // ' ' This isn ' t just a two-sided problem . It is a problem that has to be dealt with among all three parties , ' ' says a spokesman for the Czechoslovakian Embassy in Bonn. // Indeed , he says his government is eager to take action . Last October , Czechoslovakia and West Germany signed an agreement which laid the foundation for environmental cooperation on a range of issues . It didn ' t , however , spell out specific measures aimed at the Elbe. // The key sticking point is a border dispute . The East Germans claim their boundary with West Germany runs down the middle of the river ; the West says it runs along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as the dispute over how to measure the amount of waste that crosses the border into West Germany. // The West Germans have a water- quality monitoring station at Schnackenberg - near the point where the Elbe leaves the East German heartland to form the boundary between the two countries . But the East Germans insist the river doesn ' t leave their jurisdiction until much further down-stream. // But even if the border dispute could be settled , there ' s the much larger question of money . East Germany and Czechoslovakia are hesitant to invest in costly water purification equipment , since this means diverting cash from other industrial projects. // In the past , the West Germans have been willing to pick up the tab for some environmental ventures in the East . In 1982 , for instance , Bonn agreed to pay the equivalent of $36 million to help build a water treatment plant on the Spree River - which flows from East Germany into West Berlin. // ' ' But we have to think twice before we do this sort of thing on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s Ministry for Intra-German Relations . ' ' It ' s a question of fairness . It ' s not acceptable if the ( East Germans ) say : ' We ' ll cooperate , but only if you pay. ' ' ' // A more likely formula , he says , is for the West Germans to provide technology and expertise to the East in a sort of environmental joint-venture. // Indeed , such an offer has already been made concerning another highly polluted river which flows into West Germany from the East - the Werra . But nobody expects sudden progress . The two sides have been negotiating over the Werra for 14 years , without results. // Meanwhile , nobody ' s sure what it would cost to clean up the Elbe . One estimate puts the cost alone of building sewage treatment plants in Czechoslovakia and East Germany at more than $3 billion. // The exchange of environmental information between East and West is still extremely sensitive . Not only do East-bloc governments consider it embarrassing to reveal what they dump , they also worry that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , in East Germany it ' s illegal to publish water- quality data. // ' ' We get lots of requests from East German scientists asking for studies , ' ' says Gerd Flugge , director of the Hamburg-based Elbe water monitoring project . But if he asks for information in return , he says , the request is always turned down. // Even if a pact to clean up the river were signed soon , it would take years for the Elbe to flush itself clean. // All the more reason to press for action , say officials in Hamburg . The port authority is now rushing to build a special sifting machine that would separate out the most polluted parts of the mud - which could then be heaped into small hills separated from the ground below by plastic liners. // This would solve the problem for about 15 years , says the harbor authority ' s Dr. Gohren . But the city is growing impatient , he says . Earlier this summer , officials here threatened to sue the West German government , unless more is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
