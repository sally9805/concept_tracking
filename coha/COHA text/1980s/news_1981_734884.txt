txt The last time I saw Harry was in Kroch 's bookstore on La Salle Street , where I was signing copies of my latest novel . He stood next to me for a moment and then put his hand on my arm . " So , " the old man said . " I saw in the window you were going to be in today , so I wanted to see you . " " So here I am , " I said . I smiled because I did n't recognize him . " You know who I am ? " " Sure . " " OK . Who am I ? " I did n't know , and I hated the question . People always do that . They are saying , " You see , you became a big shot and you forgot Me . " I 'm not a big shot , but I do forget everyone 's face . For instance , I once introduced myself to my cousin at a party three times . " All right , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . And it was him . And I knew it . It came back , all of it . I first laid eyes on Harry more than 20 years ago . He had the haberdashery on 63d Street across from Al 's fruit market and across from the guy who sold television sets . He was near Morgan Street , three blocks off the main shopping center of 63d and Halsted . He wanted a boy to work in the store with him . He had arthritic ringers and could n't write checks very well and needed a bright boy to make out the checks for him . And address the envelopes for the late-payment notices he sent out every week . And run to the deli off 64th Street to get the corned-beef-on-a-Kaiser sandwiches for lunch . And have someone to talk to and yell at and commune with during the long days . I took the job . Harry had been in clothing all his life and had owned his own store for just a few years then . He was a short man with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby 's . His tongue was sharp , and his anger was quick , especially on Saturdays when he gave up smoking for the day , from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday . Saturday was hell on Harry and hell on the rest of us ; it was the big day of the week , the day you " made it , " and if that did n't make Harry nervous enough , not smoking his foul green cigars did . No cigars and no customers were an unendurable combination . It was the day of the week I came to dread . A few things broke up the hard days with Harry . Al would come in , reeking of vegetables . Al was a red-haired German Jew of a nonreligious persuasion who smoked long cigars and talked loud and told hideous jokes and treated Harry with affectionate disdain . Harry was a Russian Jew from an Orthodox background , and I rurally saw that he loved to revel in Al 's kidding , serving as the butt of Al 's jokes , because he knew that there was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Al 's boisterous swearing mixed Yiddish and South Side-Irish cussing in a way that approached art . He was at his best when , in the midst of entertaining Harry and me with his ribald musings on street life on 63d , a customer would enter the store and Al would n't stop his cussing . Harry 's brow would darken with the entrance of the customer . This was business , he would explain always . Fun is for later . Harry would approach the customer ? any customer , at any time ? like a matador approaching the bull . He knew he was probably going to win , but there was always the danger that the bull might get him . In a moment , standing in the bookstore , I recalled a million things . There was Herzog the tailor , who did the alterations for Harry , but never on time or at least never to Harry 's satisfaction . Harry would always remeasure all the cuffs to make certain that Herzog had rot gone crazy and made them too short . And there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and good humor infuriated Harry all the more , especially when Herzog had made the pants too short or too long . And Walter , the big black man who washed the windows three times a week ? never to Harry 's satisfaction , and the window dresser who was in a union and came around four times a year to change the dummies . In all that colorful world I remembered from my working for Harry after school and during the summer , Harry was the serious center , drawing around him the greatest collection of comic rogues I have ever known . All which makes Harry sound too hard . He was a man of sentiment and sudden tears as well , and little acts of faith and generosity . When I was 15 , his mother died , and he and his father went into a weeklong period of prayers and mourning . He gave me the keys to the store and asked me to run it for the week . Fifteen . It was then the biggest responsibility anyone had ever given me in my life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Harry said now , partly to me , partly to his memory , and partly to another old man who was his friend and had come with him downtown that day . " That was something , you know . " What a complex man , I thought , a man out of his time . There used to be thousands of Harrys in the city , merchants with a single store , carrying charge accounts , making all the marketing decisions without benefit of consultants , willing to endure the lean times for the fat times that were always ahead . They were immigrants and native-born , Jews and Italians and Irishmen , Croats and Slays and Poles . They were the " ma and pa " operators of little businesses who have mostly given it all up now and laid down meekly in the path of the bulldozers clearing the land for shopping centers and chain stores . " I 'm 72 now , what do you think of that ? " , Harry said as though he had n't expected to make it . " You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were downtown shopping the windows . " His friend laughed and agreed , and Harry took on that serious look he always had when someone was kidding him . When Harry had his little store , we would take part of every day to go up and down the street , eheoking out the prices in the windows of his rival clothing stores . Shopping the windows . " I wanted to ask you one thing , " Harry said . " You always write about the South Side , but you never write about 63d and Halsted . How come ? " " Maybe I will , " I said . " Harry . " I was touched to see him . " You want a book ? " I said , holding up a copy of the novel . " Not today . " Then he smiled and waved and walked out of the store . You see , he had just been shopping the windows .
