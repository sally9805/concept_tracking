From the start , the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet led to the sale of many I.B.M. PC ' s . Yet when it came to solving its stickiest programming problems , the International Business Machines Corporation almost always turned to Lotus ' s archrival , the Microsoft Corporation. // Until today . In a surprise announcement this morning at its annual meeting here , Lotus ' s chief executive , Jim P. Manzi , said he had signed a 10-year agreement with I.B.M. to design software for its largest computers , starting with a version of 1-2-3 for the System/370 mainframes. // The move made Lotus the first major personal-computer software company to say it would develop software for mainframes and midsize computers . All of those products , however , appear to be at least a year away from the market . <> <> Expansion on All Fronts // Mr. Manzi also outlined an ambitious plan to expand Lotus into every major segment of the software industry , a move that analysts and many Lotus executives predicted would spur a new era of software wars. // " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no choice , " said Edward J. Belove , vice president of research and development at the five-year-old company . " We are going to have to start poaching on some of our competitors ' territory. " // For Lotus , gaining I.B.M. as a software design partner is critical to its battle with Microsoft , the maker of MS-DOS , the operating system for the I.B.M. machines . Microsoft , based in Redmond , Wash. , recently overtook Lotus as the world ' s largest manufacturer of personal computer software. // But the relationship with I.B.M. still leaves Lotus vulnerable , analysts said . For all its entrepreneurial success , the company has virtually no experience in the software technology of large-scale computing . Its one past alliance in the field of software for I.B.M. mainframes , with Cullinet , collapsed before it started. // The recent history of Lotus , which is based in Cambridge , Mass. , has also shown that expansion does not necessarily equate with success. // Mr. Manzi , 35 years old , who took over when Lotus ' s founder , Mitchell D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a two-year diversification drive with mixed success. // A number of its new programs , such as Manuscript , a powerful word-processing program , and Metro , a desktop management program , have been technologically impressive but slow to sell . However , a companion program to 1-2-3 called HAL , which allows the use of English-language phrases to express 1-2-3 commands , has done well. // " We are acutely aware that it is no longer a wide-open field and we are not likely to see a hit like 1-2-3 again , " Mr. Manzi said in an interview today . <> <> Stiff Competition for Ashton-Tate // The I.B.M.-Lotus alliance ' s most devastating effect might well be on the Ashton-Tate Company , the third-largest PC software maker . With today ' s announcement , Ashton-Tate , which made its name with the dBase series of data base managers , is the only one of the three without a strategic relationship with I.B.M. , the world ' s largest computer maker . Lotus also made clear today that it intended to enter the data base market , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you view the PC software industry as being dominated by three gorillas , " one senior Lotus executive said , " two of them just grabbed all the bananas. " // Gail Pomerantz , the director of investor relations for Ashton-Tate , said in a telephone interview yesterday that the company , based in Torrance , Calif. , would have no comment on the Lotus announcement. // " Our relationship with I.B.M. has traditionally been close and cordial , and we intend to continue that , " she said . <> <> Lotus Posts Gain // In over-the-counter trading yesterday , Lotus closed at $29 , up $2. 50 ; Microsoft closed at $99 , unchanged , and Ashton-Tate fell $1. 75 , to $21. // Lotus ' s announcement - on the first day of a weeklong presentation to customers and other software manufacturers - came amid a critical period for the software industry . The introduction earlier this month of I.B.M. ' s Personal System/2 , a new family of personal computers , has thrown the software business into turmoil . Exploiting this technology requires new software and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions. // As a result , every major software maker is scrambling . And the unspoken arrangement under which each of the Big Three software manufacturers stayed off the others ' turf is disappearing . <> <> Focus on New I.B.M. Models // Microsoft , which wrote the new OS/ 2 operating system that will form the core program of I.B.M. ' s latest PC ' s , is developing more applications programs for the new I.B.M. models . One of them is a version of Excel , its leading spreadsheet that currently runs only on Apple machines . The company is also reportedly working on a sophisticated data base manager. // Spreadsheets are electronic ledgers that compile and manipulate statistics . Data base managers provide an electronic filing and retrieval system. // Ashton-Tate has also stepped up its word-processing activities and is rumored to be moving into other " office productivity " tools . In addition , it has two major data base projects under way , one for the older I.B.M. line , one for the newer line. // Lotus is headed in the same direction . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , " Mr. Manzi said . That is because so many large data bases - holding everything from corporate payrolls to performance statistics about oilfields - are stored on mainframes . One major Lotus project , disclosed at the meeting today , will focus on designing a data base system similar to those used by I.B.M. mainframes . <> <> Courting the Corporate Audience // Such programs are not likely to prove popular or useful among the home and office users who spend $495 on a copy of 1-2-3 . Rather , they are aimed at I.B.M. ' s biggest customers : the corporate data-processing managers willing to spend tens of thousands of dollars in order to run virtually identical programs on everything from PC ' s to multimillion-dollar mainframes. // " It ' s a market that Lotus could not get into without I.B.M. ' s help , " said Rick Sherlund , the technology analyst at Goldman , Sachs &; Company. // Under the agreement , the mainframe software will be distributed under the logotypes of both I.B.M. and Lotus . That should provide some reassurance for computers users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the personal computer arena , cumbersome. // For Lotus , managing the alliance with I.B.M. could prove more challenging than creating the software . Though it is among the software industry ' s giants , Lotus employs only about 1 , 000 people . I.B.M. is more than 300 times its size . <> <> Loss of Focus Seen // Some analysts said Mr. Manzi ' s diversification efforts had caused Lotus to lose its focus . Mr. Sherlund of Goldman , Sachs estimated that despite those efforts , 1-2-3 still accounted last year for 70 percent of Lotus ' s $283 million in sales and 85 percent of its $48 million in profits. // Growth in unit sales slowed to 22 percent , with the biggest gains coming overseas . This year , those sales are expected to rise by 15 percent to 20 percent. // The question no one can answer is whether Lotus came keep Microsoft at bay. // " We are all racing to get bigger at a time that is getting harder and harder to do , " Mr. Belove said . " There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> <> I.B.M. OPTIMISM <> NEW ORLEANS , April 27 ( AP ) - The International Business Machines Corporation is undergoing a rapid transformation involving new products , cuts in expenses and an emphasis on sales , the company ' s chairman , John F. Akers , said today at the company ' s annual meeting of shareholders. // His statements buoyed I.B.M. ' s stock , which rose $2. 50 a share , to $154. 25 , on the New York Stock Exchange. // Shareholders defeated a proposal calling for the computer giant to stop sales and service of its products in South Africa . I.B.M. announced last year it would sell its operations in South Africa to a newly formed unit made up of local management. //
