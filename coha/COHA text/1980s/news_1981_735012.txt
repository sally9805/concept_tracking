txt DEAR ABBY : You said when a woman wears a flower over her left ear irmeanb " I 'm available . " A flower over the right ear means " I 'm taken , " and a flower over both ears means " Let 's negotiate . " Actually , a flower over the left ear means " I 'm taken .

DEAR ABBY : I met a girl a few months ago , and I asked her out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kiss her goodnight , she said , " Do n't rush it . " I felt like an idiot . I figured she did n't like me , so I did n't call her for a long time . Then I got to thinking that maybe it was to her credit that she did n't jump at the chance to kiss a guy she only had known a few hours . So I asked her out again and we had a wonderful time , Tills time I did n't try to kiss her , but when we said Bristol , Cann . Dear Bristol : And it 's nice for a hard-to-get girl to know that she 's appreciated .
