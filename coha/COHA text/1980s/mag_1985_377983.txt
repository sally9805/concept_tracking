Corporate Raider Carl Icahn 's usual strategy is to buy a stake in a target company and then sell out to another bidder at a huge profit . But this time the New York City financier may stick around and keep the business . Last week he gained virtual control of TWA , the sixth largest U.S. airline , by accumulating at least 45.5% of the company 's stock . In the process Icahn may have defeated Frank Lorenzo , the chairman of Texas Air and a rival bidder for TWA , with a series of intricate maneuvers worthy of the Navy 's Blue Angels flying aces . <P> Only last June TWA 's board tentatively accepted a $23-a-share takeover bid from Lorenzo to escape a previous $18-a-share offer by Icahn . In fact , TWA President Carl Meyer openly courted Lorenzo , fearing that Icahn might dismantle the company and sell its pieces for quick gain . After the TWA-Lorenzo deal , Wall Street expected Icahn to cash in his 35% stake and reap an estimated $50 million profit . <P> But TWA 's unions , led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a Lorenzo takeover . They feared that he would once again resort to a tactic he had used after Texas Air won a battle for control of Continental Airlines . In 1983 Lorenzo took Continental into bankruptcy proceedings , which enabled the company to void union contracts and slash employee salaries . That maneuver earned Lorenzo a reputation as a union buster . <P> To prevent the Texas Air chairman from taking over TWA , ALPA Executive Council Chairman Harry Hoglander quietly approached Icahn with a highly unusual deal . The union said that if Icahn bought the airline , TWA 's 3,500 pilots would accept a 26% pay cut in exchange for a block of the airline 's stock . Icahn accepted the pilots ' proposition and then concluded a similar arrangement with TWA 's International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers . The two unions represent about 17,000 of TWA 's 27,000 workers , and the total value of the wage concessions offered amounted to about $145 million annually . In return Icahn promised to give employees 20% of the airline 's stock , as well as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismantle TWA or dispose of any assets related to airline jobs . Icahn told TIME that " the unions have obviously made the company more attractive . " <P> With the labor agreements in hand , Icahn sweetened his bid to $24 a share , or a total of more than $500 million for the two-thirds of the airline 's stock that he did not already own , topping the Texas Air offer by $1 a share . Lorenzo countered at week 's end with a $26-a-share bid , but ' Icahn disregarded this last-ditch offer , saying that he would continue to purchase TWA stock and close in on the 51% total needed for outright control of the company . Said Icahn 's ally Hoglander : " Full steam ahead and damn the torpedoes . " <P> As the wily financier played out his hand , a third potential offer for TWA suddenly arose from a group of the airline 's workers , led by white-collar , non-unionized employees . Advised by Christopher Bond , a former Governor of Missouri , this faction had reportedly raised more than $1 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to top the Icahn and Lorenzo bids.
