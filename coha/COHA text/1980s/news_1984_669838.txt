HOUSTON  --  Enstar Corp. ' s second largest shareholder said he will back another dissident holder ' s planned proxy fight if the company isn ' t sold in the next two months . Thomas C. Thompson , leader of an investment group holding about 7. 1% of Enstar ' s common outstanding , rejected the company ' s invitation for him to join its board . Enstar had asked Mr. Thompson to become a director , and thereby serve as an " independent watchdog " over management . The move had been viewed as an attempt by Enstar to placate angry shareholders who seek the sale of the company . In a letter to Enstar ' s chairman , O. Charles Honig , Mr. Thompson called the invitation " a meaningless sham . " His rebuff is a major setback for Enstar , an energy concern . Under pressure from its largest holder , Enstar has been trying to find its own buyer for the company . Mr. Thompson ' s response increases the pressure on Enstar to find a buyer before its scheduled June 21 annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the company ' s common and convertible preferred shares , has proposed a proxy fight to oust management and sell the company . That threat moved Enstar ' s management to seek its own buyer for the company , but Mr. Huffington has refused the company ' s invitation to " participate in the process " of selling the company . In the letter , Mr. Thompson said he wouldn ' t join Enstar ' s board because the company refused to allow his direct participation in selling the company . " You eliminated the teeth in the proposed watchdog proposal , " he told Mr. Honig . " You would prefer to continue to manage the company ' s business affairs free from the scrutiny of meaningful participation of any new independent stockholder representatives . " Mr. Thompson leads a group that holds 1 , 225 , 590 Enstar shares and includes Gulf States Oil &; Refining Co. and M.H. Whittier Corp . The group has said it may seek additional Enstar shares . Mr. Thompson ' s letter also alleged an " obvious conflict of interest " involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both to find a buyer and to defend against any proxy battle . A spokesman for Enstar denied the existence of a conflict of interest and said the company regretted Mr. Thompson ' s refusal to join the board . The spokesman said Mr. Thompson " made some demands that our board thought were ill-advised and not in our shareholders ' best interests . " The spokesman wouldn ' t specify what " demands " Mr. Thompson made . Alan Gaines , a New York money manager who holds more than 5% of Enstar ' s common , contended Enstar ' s chances of defeating Mr. Huffington in a proxy fight are " remote . " Several big institutional investors have said they would support the Houston oilman ' s fight . Mr. Huffington couldn ' t be reached for comment . Mr. Gaines and other institutional shareholders were angered last year when Enstar instituted a " poison pill preferred stock " anti-takeover defense after shareholders had earlier voted down other anti-takeover measures . Separately , Mr. Huffington said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that he intends to convert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him slightly less than 10% of the company ' s common . Each share of preferred is convertible into seven shares of common . Mr. Huffington previously owned 8. 4% of the company ' s common .
