The examination now consists of a single multiple-choice test of general knowledge and knowledge about teaching . Thirty states , including New York and New Jersey , use the test in issuing provisional teaching certificates . Connecticut has its own test , as do several other states. // Critics , including teachers ' unions , say the basic examination is simplistic and does not measure the diverse knowledge and skills required to be a teacher . They also say that since prospective teachers from non-white groups fail at a much higher rate than whites , the test is inherently discriminatory. // The new system , to be in use by 1992 , will consist of examinations given over two or more years during a candidate ' s college education and early teaching career . Educators said this could act as an incentive for teachers to improve their skills before and after they are in the classroom. // Officials of the Educational Testing Service , one of the country ' s largest test makers , said the new sections , which are still being developed , would probably include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of general knowledge as early as the end of the sophomore year in college. // * An examination of teaching knowledge and skills at the end of the student ' s training , making use of videotapes , computer simulations and other techniques. // * Classroom observation once a candidate has begun full-time teaching . <> <> New Approach Is Taken // Gregory R. Anrig , president of Educational Testing Service , emphasized that the new plan was not a " revision of the N.T.E. " but " a whole new approach to teacher certification. " // " It ' s a response to the growing interest in teacher testing on the part of state legislatures , " he said . " We ' re also building in new measurement techniques that were not technically possible before. " // The changes were welcomed by the country ' s two largest teachers ' unions , both of which had representatives on an advisory committee that helped draft the changes . Mary Hatwood Futrell , president of the National Education Association , called the change " a step in the right direction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teachers , termed it " much better than what we have now. " // Mr. Anrig declined to speculate on whether the new approach would narrow the gap between the performances of white and non-white teaching students , but he added , " The one thing that no test will do is change the fact that there are unequal educational opportunities in this country. " // Another likely factor in the decision to abandon the testing program was the pressure from the newly established National Board for Professional Teaching Standards , set up two years ago with foundation support . The current test generates about $10 million a year for the nonprofit test maker , which is in Lawrence Township , N.J. <> <> National System in Works // The board of teaching standards is devising the first national system of advanced certification for experienced teachers . It would be comparable to the specialty boards in medicine. // The board is conducting research on new techniques for evaluating teacher performance , such as the use of video and computer simulations , that are likely to make multiple-choice tests obsolete. // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced ones , " said Mr. Anrig of the Educational Testing Service . " But we plan to cooperate with the national board and make full use of any of their findings that are relevant to what we ' re trying to do. " // E.T.S. says 30 states use the National Teachers Examinations to evaluate new teachers , up from 8 in 1983 . Other states use their own tests or those of other publishers. // The testing of prospective and current teachers has increased enormously in the 1980 ' s , mainly as a result of the wave of school-improvement efforts enacted around the country . In 1977 only Mississippi and North Carolina required new teachers to pass statewide licensing examinations . Today 43 states do so. // State and local politicians have sought the tests as a means of assuring that money allocated for higher teacher salaries or other projects will be well spent . <> <> Variance in Passing Rates // Critics also note that non-whites pass standardized teaching tests at much lower rates than whites . A 19-state study , which included New York , Connecticut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black teaching candidates to be 15 to 50 percent , while the rate for whites was 71 to 96 percent. // " Unless these standardized tests are altered , the number of minority teachers will continue to dwindle , " said G. Pritchy Smith , a professor of education at the University of North Florida who is the author of the study. // The new system addresses these criticisms . For one thing , there will be a series of assessments over two or more years , rather than a one-time test. // Ms. Futrell praised the fact that the test of general knowledge will come in the middle of a student ' s undergraduate studies rather than on the eve of certification . " Students will be told the results early , which means that there is plenty of time for them to make up any deficiencies , " she said. // The new test of teaching skill knowledge , coming after a student has completed his or her education courses , will make use of such devices as videotapes of classroom situations or interactive computer exercises that will permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , one question on a past test presented a situation in which a teacher " seemed unable to engage students in extended classroom discussion . " The students , it said , " usually answered ' yes ' or ' no ' to any questions they were asked " // Test takers were given the choice of five possible teaching strategies , including " give the students positive reinforcement more often " and " analyze the kinds of questions that were asked . " The latter was the " correct " answer. // In the new tests , students might be shown the classroom situation on video and even have the opportunity to see an enactment of the consequences of whatever choice they made . They could then answer follow-up questions that might help better guide them. // Ms. Futrell , who has said the teachers ' examination was racially biased , suggested that adding classroom observations to the certifying process should help the performance of minority students. // Mr. Anrig said that his organization expected to spend $20 million developing the new assessment program. // Candidates now pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the N.T.E. Mr. Anrig declined to estimate how much more the new system might cost. // The District of Columbia and the following states currently use the National Teachers Examination : <> <> Arizona <> Arkansas <> California <> Delaware <> Hawaii <> Idaho <> Indiana <> Kansas <> Kentucky <> Louisiana <> Maine <> Maryland <> Minnesota <> Mississippi <> Montana <> Nebraska <> Nevada <> New Jersey <> New Mexico <> New York <> N.
