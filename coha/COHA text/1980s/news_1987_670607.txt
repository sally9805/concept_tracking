The man accused of committing the robbery , Victor Manuel Gerena of Hartford , is not here in Federal court . He is believed to be in Cuba , with some of the $7 million he is accused of stealing. // Instead , 16 others - most of whom are from Puerto Rico and had never seen Connecticut before their arrest in 1985 - are accused . The Government says they are members or supporters of a terrorist group called Los Macheteros - Spanish for " the machete wielders " - that masterminded the robbery to help finance their campaign for Puerto Rican independence. // Since last Jan. 13 , teams of defense lawyers and prosecutors have been mired in pretrial proceedings in a courtroom on the second floor of the Federal building here. // A trial could last two years , the participants say , but there is no agreement on when it might begin : in May , according to the prosecution ; not before September , according to some of the defense lawyers. // With no end in sight , the possibility of plea bargaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense lawyers and defendants. // Although the defendants are charged with robbery of federally insured bank funds , theft from interstate shipment and obstruction of commerce by robbery , the Wells Fargo robbery is seldom mentioned in court. // Instead , defense lawyers charge , the defendants are being prosecuted for their political views. // One defense lawyer , Rafael Anglada-Lopez of New York , said the Government had used the robbery as " an excuse " to prosecute the defendants and the independence movement far away from Puerto Rico. // Prosecutors deny any political motivation . They say Los Macheteros were linked to the Wells Fargo robbery by wiretaps and other surveillance by the F.B.I. into suspected acts of terrorism in Puerto Rico. // There is little disagreement over the complexity of the case . Since the first hearing on Sept. 3 , 1985 , more than 2 , 000 motions , responses and rulings have been made. // Surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation , much of it in Puerto Rico , produced more than 1 , 100 tapes of wiretapped conversations and more than 5 , 000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 150 , 000 documents from the defendants ' homes and offices. // " A black hole , " one defense lawyer , Diane Polan of New Haven , said of the case , which she described as having too much evidence and too much Government misconduct to be tried. // Another defense lawyer , John R. Williams of New Haven , said the Government had devoted more resources and more electronic surveillance to this case than in any prosecution of organized crime. // " There is no question this is , to date , the longest evidentiary , pretrial proceeding in a criminal case , " he said . " It ' s going to reach all records . " ' Not an Easy Case ' // Last October the Connecticut Law Tribune estimated that the Federal Government had spent about $15 million on its investigation , prosecution and public defenders. // One of the six Federal prosecutors , William J. Corcoran , described the case as " cumbersome " but not too unwieldy . " It ' s an enormously broad-based set of facts , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel you ' ve got a grasp on all the facts. " // There was elaborate security when the first defendants were brought to Hartford from Puerto Rico in 1985 . Sharpshooters patrolled roofs of nearby buildings , police dogs sniffed for bombs and a side street by the courthouse was barricaded. // These days , two metal detectors and a few Federal marshals guard the courtroom . Few spectators show up . To accommodate all the defendants and their lawyers , Judge T. Emmet Clarie had three rows of tables - known to the defense as " the bleachers " - built in tiers along one side of the courtroom. // The defendants , not all of whom are in court every day , listen occasionally on earphones as an interpreter translates the proceedings into Spanish . <> <> ' Being in Siberia ' // Two of the defendants , Juan Segarra Palmer and Filiberto Ojeda Rios , described by the Government as the leaders of Los Macheteros , have been jailed since their arrest more than 26 months ago . Defense lawyers say it is the longest pretrial detention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defendants who they believe are a danger to the community. // " The only reason they are being held is because the Government believes they are leaders of a political organization , " said a defense lawyer , Michael Deutsch of Chicago. // At least four other defendants have moved to Hartford from Puerto Rico to be near the proceedings. // One , Luz Maria Berrios Berrios , who is married to Mr. Segarra , said their son and daughter had enrolled in the Hartford public schools and were getting good grades . She said she was on welfare and misses the warm weather of Puerto Rico . " It ' s like being in Siberia , " she said. $60 an Hour Supporters in Puerto Rico have raised money to rent apartments in Hartford for some of the defendants and their out-of-town lawyers . Most of the defense lawyers are being paid by the Federal Government as public defenders , at the rate of $60 an hour for in-court work and $40 an hour for out-of-court work. // One defense lawyer , Hal Meyerson of New York City , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost my partnership over this , " he said of the months spent on the Wells Fargo case. // At issue in the hearings are an estimated 2 , 000 hours of court-authorized wiretaps made on the defendants ' homes and telephones , which both sides regard as crucial to the Government ' s case . The defense is seeking to have the tapes excluded from evidence. // Last week , Tyler Morgan , one of 64 F.B.I. agents who conducted the eavesdropping in Puerto Rico , testified that he and another agent , in violation of Federal wiretap laws , had listened to some defendants ' conversations without recording what was said. // He also said that he later falsely signed an affidavit denying that he illegally wiretapped defendants ' conversations but then crossed out his signature . <> <> Wiretap Evidence // The defense also contends that agents tampered with some tapes. // Mr. Corcoran , the deputy chief of the Justice Department ' s narcotics section in Washington , who is working on this case because of his experience with wiretap evidence , said the defense had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recordings that the defense is challenging . He said the testimony so far did not warrant suppressing the tapes. // According to the defense , news accounts of negotiations on possible plea bargaining began appearing after improprieties with the Government ' s wiretap evidence were brought out in the hearings . Government attorneys said they could not comment on any negotiations. // " We wish to make it very clear that conversations have taken place between some of our lawyers and the prosecution , " four of the defendants said in a joint statement on Dec. 15. // One of the four was Mr. Ojeda , who also issued a separate statement . It said some defendants " would not enter into any kind of discussion which would result in any recognition of the jurisdiction of the colonial power over our people. " // Prosecutors have said Mr. Ojeda is a Cuban intelligence agent. // As the hearings drag on , Judge Clarie , who is 74 years old and was appointed to the Federal bench in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy , occasionally asks his own questions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already covered. // At times the lawyers and defendants cast amused glances at a sign facing them on the clerk ' s desk , which warns what to do in case of fire . " Play it safe , " it reads . " Plan your escape. ' //
