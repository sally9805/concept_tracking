Lawrence Kitchen , chairman and chief executive of Lockheed Corp. , was more than a little embarrassed when he told a congressional committee about the loss last week . A batch of 1,460 documents dealing with the F-19 Stealth fighter plane , nearly all of them classified secret and one top secret , has simply disappeared from Lockheed 's files in California .
