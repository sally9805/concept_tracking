ARTHUR <P> Directed and Written by Steve Gordon <P> Bertie Wooster and Jeeves - P.G . Wodehouse 's immortal idler and stiff-upper-wit servant - are back , living in New York City under assumed names . <P> The former , in the person of the title character , is played by adorable Dudley Moore . The latter , known here as Hobson , has been updated by Sir John Gielgud to the point where he can deliver an obscene riposte if need be . But the basic joke remains the same : a rich man , perpetually tiddly from drink , gets incompetent self into various muddles ; unflappable gentleman 's gentleman gets him out . It has always been an excellent joke , and Writer-Director Gordon has added a dash of sentiment to their relationship , trusting Sir John 's expertise to keep things taut and tart , which he does admirably . <P> Arthur 's love life is also a smidge busier than Bertie 's . There is , of course , an arranged match with a frightful rich girl ( Jill Eikenberry ) to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be claimed . She is played , with agreeable lack of mannerism , by Liza Minnelli as a **25;5119;TOOLONG shoplifter . It is nice to see the rich being silly again , the common people sensible , as in ' 30s screwball farces . And to hear exchanges like this : Arthur : " I think I 'll take a bath . " Hobson : " I 'll alert the media . " Moviegoers are hereby alerted to some good fun . <P> - R.S.
