Leaning forward , hands folded atop the long oaken table that dominates his conference room/office in Darmouth College ' s venerable Baker Library , Dr. Kemeny observes that for 20 years now he has believed that ' ' computer literacy is an essential part of a liberal education . And I do not believe that you can in any sense be computer literate if you ' ve never programmed. ' ' // That ' s a point of view some in academia take issue with - Yale professor Roger Schank , for instance . He is the author of ' ' The Cognitive Computer , ' ' a new book on artificial intelligence that ' s causing a stir within the computer fraternity . Dr. Schank has argued that ' ' computer literacy , ' ' including a knowledge of programming , is about as crucial to the average computer user as ' ' automobile literacy ' ' is to someone learning how to drive. // From his pastoral Ivy League campus , which now nurtures as many high-tech marvels as pine trees , Kemeny calmly pursues his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' m necessarily arguing that people are going to program for the rest of their lives . But you can ' t really understand what computers are about without having written some programs yourself. ' ' // Back in 1964 , Kemeny and his Dartmouth colleague Thomas Kurtz took a big step toward giving such beliefs practical expression . They co-invented the BASIC computer language and thus swung open the door to programming for thousands of relative novices . About the same time , the two scientists developed the first time-sharing system , which made Dartmouth ' s central computer available to a wider range of users and lent crucial momentum to a then embryonic high-tech revolution. // Throughout his academic career , including an eventful stint as Dartmouth ' s president ( 1970-81 , during which period he chaired President Carter ' s commission on the Three Mile Island nuclear plant mishap ) , Kemeny has stood for the wider dispersal of computer know-how . In his view , people in this age have to know what those blinking screens and whirring disks are all about if they ' re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the machines can do for them. // In line with these views , Kemeny teaches , as often as three times a year , a computer literacy course for students who are not going into the sciences . The subject matter deals , in part , with the logic of programming , and students have to write or modify an average of 30 to 35 programs during the term . His current class has an enrollment of 110. // ' ' Now , they ' re obviously not computer experts when they come in , ' ' Kemeny says , with an accent that hints at his upbringing in Hungary , ' ' but they have a totally different feeling about computers when they finish. ' ' // He points out , for instance , that people who ' ve been exposed to programming are not likely to be easily taken in when such terms as ' ' intelligent machines ' ' are bandied about . ' ' I don ' t like to be repetitious in class , ' ' says Kemeny with a half smile , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least once every two weeks - is that computers are basically very stupid. ' ' // If you ask a computer to solve a problem , he says , but forget to ask it to tell you what the answer is , it won ' t . Computers totally lack common sense , he asserts. // Students should also be given a chance to grasp just how much a program can reflect the attitudes , even the biases , of its conceivers , Kemeny says . ' ' That ' s one of the subjects I often speak of - about the hidden value judgments that are in computer programs . The programmer who writes a sophisticated piece of software in effect has built in a view of your world for you . Hopefully the one you want. // ' ' But it could easily have assumptions or certain ways of looking at things which are not the way you wanted to look at it , ' ' he cautions . ' ' And unless you understand it , with enough sophistication to at least ask the right questions about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' // He draws an example from the workings of a college bureaucracy . The software used by the campus accounting office is likely to view financial aid as an expense to the school - the standard budgetary approach . But an alternative view might be to look at such aid as uncollected or partial tuition on the revenue side of the ledger - an unorthodox approach which Kemeny in fact championed at Dartmouth , and which , he says , has revamped the school ' s financial aid policy. // But if the former perception is built into accounting software , you can ' t get at it , he argues . Then a school ' s governing board is , in effect , constrained to view things through the eyes of some tradition-bound programmer/accountant. // And he sees the implications of biased software ballooning as you move into governmental areas such as defense planning . ' ' Frankly , it scares the daylights out of me , ' ' says Kemeny , airing his concern that a ' ' star wars ' ' technology could leave the ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer . ' ' I just don ' t trust any computer that way . In particular , I don ' t trust the people who write the programs. ' ' // Dr. Kemeny ' s concern with nuclear weapons has deep personal roots . He was among the scientists who took part in the Manhattan Project in the mid- ' 40s , which led to the first atomic bomb , and was at one time an assistant to Albert Einstein at Princeton ' s Center for Advanced Studies. // Returning the conversation to the classroom venue at Dartmouth , Kemeny offers one more insight on the value of exposing students to computer programming . It ' s a great teaching tool , he says . ' ' If they have to write the program themselves , they get a much deeper understanding of how it works than if somebody just explained it to them . It ' s a variant of the old adage that the best way to learn a subject is to teach it. // ' ' What the students have , ' ' he says , casting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care about , is that they ' re teaching a computer how to solve the problem . And they learn an enormous amount. ' ' // // Next Friday : A look at the booming use of computers among students and faculty at Dartmouth. // //
