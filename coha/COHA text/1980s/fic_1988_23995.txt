CUSTOMS OF THE COUNTRY By Madison Smartt Bell Ido n't remember much about that place anymore . It was nothing but somewhere 1 came to put in some pretty bad time , though that was not what I had planned on when I went there . I had it in mind to improve things , but I do n't think you could fairly claim that 's what 1 did . So that 's one reason I might just as soon forget about it . And I did n't stay there all that long , not more than about nine months or so , about the same time , come to think , that the child I was there to try to get back had lived inside my body . It was a cluster-housing thing a little ways north out of town from Roanoke , on a two-lane road that crossed the railroad cut and went about a mile further up through the woods . The buildings looked something like a motel , a little raw still , though they were n't new . My apartment was no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet cost me little enough so I had something left over to give the lawyer . There was fresh paint on the walls and the trim in the kitchen and bathroom was in fair shape . And it was real quiet mostly , except that the man next door used to beat up his wife a couple of times a week . The place was soundproof enough I could n't usually hear talk but I could hear yelling plain as day and when he got going good he would slam her bang into our common wall . If she hit in just the right spot it would send my pots and pans flying off the pegboard where I 'd hung them above the stove . Not that it mattered to me that the pots fell down , except foi the noise and the time it took to pick them up again . Living alone like I was , I did n't have the heart to do much cooking and if Madison Smartt Bell 's most recent novel is The Year of Silence . I did fix myself something I mostly used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall . All the others I only had out for show . The whole apartment was done about the same way , made into something 1 kept spotless arid did n't much care to use . I wore , my hands out scrubbing everything clean and then saw to it that it stayed that way . I sewed slipcovers for that threadbare batch of Goodwill furniture I 'd put in the place , and I hung curtains and found some sunshiny posters to tack on the walls , and I never cared a damn about any of it . It was an act , and 1 was n't putting it on for me or for Davey , but for all the other people I expected to come to see it and judge it . And however good I could get it looking , it never felt quite right . I felt even less at home there than 1 did at my job , which was waitressirig three snake-bends of the counter at the TruCkstops of America out at the 1-81 interchange . Trie supervisor was a man named Tim that used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . He was nice about letting me take my phone calls there and giving me time off to see the lawyer , and in most other ways he was a decent man to work for , except that now and then he would have a tantrum over something or other and try to scream the walls down . Still , it never went beyond yelling , and he always acted sorry once he got through . The other waitress on my shift was an older lady named Prissy , and I liked her all right in spite of the name . We were both on a swing shift that rolled over every ten days , which was the main thing did n't like about that job .. The six-to-two I hated the worst because it would have me getting hack to my apartment building around three in the morning , not the time it looked its best . It was the kind of place where at that time of night 1 could expect to find the deputies out there looking for somebody , or else some other kind of trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , but a lot of them were pretty sorry  --  small-time criminals , dope-dealers and thieves , none of them much good at whatever it was they did . There was one check forger that I knew of , and a man who would break into the other apartments looking for whiskey . One thing and another , along that line . The man next door , the one that beat up his wife , did n't do crimes or work either that I ever heard . He just seemed to lay around the place , maybe drawing some kind of welfare . There was n't a whole lot of him , he was just a stringy little man , hair and mustache a dishwater brown , cheap green tattoos running up his arms . Maybe he was stronger than he looked , but I did wonder how come his wife would take it from him , since she was about a head taller and must have outweighed him an easy ten pounds . I might have thought she was whipping on him  --  stranger things have been known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like she might break out crying if you looked at her crooked . She was a big fine-looking girl with a lovely shape , and long brown hair real smooth and straight and shiny . I guess she was too hammered down most of the time to pay much at-tention to how she dressed , but still she had pretty brown eyes , big and long-lashed and soft sort of like a cow 's eyes , except I never saw a cow that looked that miserable . At first I thought maybe I might make a friend of her , she was about the only one around there I felt like I might want to . Our paths crossed pretty frequent , either around the apartment building or in the Kwik Sack back toward town , where I 'd find her running the register some days . But she was shy of me , shy of anybody I suppose . She would flinch if you did so much as say hello . So after a while I quit trying . She 'd get hers about twice a week , maybe other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a wonder all the things you can learn to ignore , and after a month or so I was that accustomed I barely noticed when they would start in . I would just wait till I thought they were good and through , and then get up and hang those pans back on the wall where they were supposed to go . And all the while I would just be thinking about some other thing , like what might be going on with my Davey . The place where he had been fostered out was not all that far away , just about ten or twelve miles up the road , out there in the farm country . The people were named Baker . I never got to first names with them , just called them Mr. and Mrs. They were older than me , both just into their forties , and they did n't have any children of their own . The place was only a small farm but Mr. Baker grew tobacco on the most of it and I 'm told he made it a paying thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she grew a garden and canned in the old-time way . Thrifty people . They were real sweet to Davey and he seemed to like being with them pretty well . He had been staying there almost the whole two years , which was lucky too , since most children usually got moved around a whole lot more than that . And that was the trouble , like the lawyer explained to me , it was just too good . Davey was doing too well out there . He 'd made out better in the first grade than anybody would have thought . So nobody really felt like he needed to be moved . The worst of it was the Bakers had got to like him well enough they were saying they wanted to adopt him if they could . Well , it would have been hard enough for me without that coming into it . Even though he was so close , I did n't go out to see Davey near as much as I would have liked to . The lawyer kept telling me it was n't a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Better take it easy till all the evaluations came in and we had our court date and all . Still , I would call and go on out there maybe a little more than once a month , most usually on the weekends , since that seemed to suit the Bakers better . They never acted like it was any trouble , and they were always pleasant to me , or polite might be a better word yet . The way it sometimes seemed they did n't trust me did bother me a little . I would have liked to take him out to the movies a time or two , but I could see plain enough the Bakers would n't have been easy about me having him off their place . But I ca n't remember us having a bad time , any of those times I went . He was always happy to see me , though he 'd be quiet when we were in the house , with Mrs. Baker hovering . So I would get us outside quick as ever I could and , once we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were children . There was an open pasture , a creek with a patch of woods , a hay barn where we would play hide-and-go-seek . I do n't know what all else we did , silly things mostly . That was how I could get near him the easiest , he did n't get a whole lot of playing in , way out there . The Bakers were n't what you would call playful and there were n't any other children living near . So that was the thing I could give him that was all mine to give . When the weather was good we would stay outside together most all the day and he would just wear me out . But over the winter those visits seemed to get shorter and shorter , like the days . Davey called me Momma still , but I suppose he had come to think your mother was something more like a big sister or just some kind of a friend . Mrs. Baker was the one doing for him all the time . I do n't know just what he remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had part . He would always mind me but he never acted scared around me , and if anybody says he did they lie . But I never really did get to know what he had going on in the back of his mind about the past . At first I worried the Bakers might have been talking against me , but after I had seen a little more of them I knew they would n't have done anything like that , would n't have thought it right . So I expect whatever Davey knew about that other time he remembered on his own . He never mentioned Patrick hardly and I think he really had forgotten about him . Thinking back I guess he never saw that much of Patrick even when we were all living together . But Davey had Patrick 's mark all over him , the same eyes and the same red hair . Patrick had thick wavy hair the shade of an Irish setter 's , and a big rolling mustache the same color . Maybe that was his best feature , but he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prison haircut do n't suit him . If he ever had much of a thought in his head I suspect he had knocked it clean out with dope , yet he was always fun to be around . I was n't but seventeen when I married him and did n't have any better sense myself . Right to the end I never thought anything much was the matter , all his vices looked so small to me . He was good-tempered almost all the time , and good with Davey when he did notice him . Never once did he raise his hand to either one of us . In little ways he was unreliable , late , not showing up at all , gone out of the house for days sometimes . Hindsight shows me he ran with other women , but I managed not to know anything about that at the time . He had not quite finished high school and the best job he could hold was being an orderly down at the hospital , but he made a good deal of extra money stealing pills out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something else I did n't allow myself to think on much back then , Patrick never told me a lot about it anyhow , always acted real mysterious about whatever he was up to in that line . He would disappear on one of his trips and come back with a whole mess of money , and I would spend up my share and he glad I had it too . I never thought much about where it was coming from , the money or the pills either one . He used to keep all manner of pills around the house , Valium and Ludes and a lot of different kinds of speed , and we both took what we felt like whenever we felt in the mood . But what Patrick made the most on was Dilaudid . I used to take it without ever knowing what it really was , but once everything fell in on us I found out it was a had was n't much snow or anything , but I was cold just about all the time , except when I was at work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaters , and they cost too much for me to leave them running very long at a stretch . I 'd keep it just warm enough so I could n't see my breath , and spend my time in a hot bathtub or under a big pile of blankets on the bed . Or else I would just be cold . There was some kind of strange quietness about that place all during the cold weather . If the phone rang it would make me jump . Did n't seem like there was any TV or radio ever playing next door . The only sound coming cut of there was Susan getting beat up once in a while . That was her name , a sweet name , I think . I found it out from hearing him say it , which he used to do almost every time before he started on her . " Susan , " he 'd call out , loud enough I could hear him through the wall . He 'd do it a time or two , he might have been calling her to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come a bad silence that reminded you of a snake being somewhere around . Then a few minutes ' worth of hitting sounds and then the big slam as she hit the wall , and the clatter of my pots falling on the floor . He 'd throw her at the wall maybe once or twice , usually when he was about to get through . By the time the pots had quit spinning on the floor it would be real quiet over there again , and the next time I saw Susan she 'd be walking in that ginger way people have when they 're hiding a hurt , and if I said hello to her she 'd give a little jump and look away . After a while I quit paying it much mind , it did n't feel any different to me than hearing the news on the radio , All their carrying on was not any more to me than a bump in the rut I had worked myself into , going back and forth from the job , cleaning that apartment till it hurt , calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was happening , which never was much . He was forever trying to get our case before some particular doctor or social worker or judge who 'd be more apt to help us than another , so he said . I would call him up from the TOA , all eager to hear what news he had and every time it was another delay . In the beginning I used to talk it all over with Tim or Prissy after I hung up , but after a while I got out of the mood to discuss it . I kept ahead making those calls but every one of them just wore out my hope a little more , like a drip of water wearing down a stone . And little by little I got in the habit of thinking that nothing really was going to change . Somehow or other that winter passed by , with me going from one phone call to the next , going out to wait on that TOA counter , coming home to shiver and hold hands with myself and lie awake all through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on . It was springtime , well into warm weather , before anything really happened at all . That was when the lawyer called me , for a change , and told me he had some people lined up to see me at last . Well , I was all ready for them to come visit , come see how I 'd fixed up my house and all the rest of my business to get set for having Davey back with me again . But as it turned out , nobody seemed to feel like they were called on to make that trip . " I do n't think that will be necessary " was what one of them said , I do n't recall which . They both talked about the same , in voices that sounded like filling out forms . So all I had to do was drive downtown a couple of times and see them in their offices . That child psychologist was the first and I doubt he kept me more than half an hour . I could n't tell the point of most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social worker , who turned out to be a black lady once I got down there , though I never could have told it over the phone . Her voice sounded like it was coming out of the TV . She looked me in the eye while she was asking her questions , but I could n't tell a thing about what she thought . It was n't till I was back in the apartment that I understood she must have already had her mind made up . That came to me in a sort of a flash , while I was standing in the kitchen washing out a cup . Soon as I walked back in the door I saw my coffee mug left over from breakfast , and I kicked myself for letting it sit out . I was giving it a hard scrub with a scouring pad when I realized it did n't matter anymore . 1 might just as well have dropped it on the floor and got what kick I could out of watching it smash , because it was n't go . ing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same I rinsed it and set it in the drainer , careful as if it was an eggshell . Then I stepped backward out of the kitchen and took a long look around that cold shabby place and thought it might be for the best that nobody was coming . How could I have expected it to fool anybody else when it was n't even good enough to fool me ? A lonesomeness came over me , I felt like I was floating all alone in the middle of cold air , and then I began to remember some things would just as soon as have not . No , 1 never did like to think about this part , but I have had to think about it time and again , with never a break for a long , long time , because I needed to get to understand it at least well enough to believe it never would ever happen anymore . And I had come to believe that , in the end . If I had n't , I never would have come back at all . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it took me a full two years to do it , and though of course it still did n't mean that anybody else would trust me . What had happened was that Patrick went off on one of his mystery trips and stayed gone a deal longer than usual . Two nights away , I was used to that , but on the third I did start to wonder . He normally would have called at least , if he was going to be gone that long of a stretch . But I did n't hear a peep until about halfway through the fourth day . And it was n't Patrick himself that called , but one of those public-assistance lawyers from downtown . Seemed like the night before Patrick had got himself stopped on the interstate loop down there . The troopers said he was driving like a blind man , and he was so messed up on whiskey and ludes I suppose he must have been pretty near blind at that . Well , maybe he would have just lost his license or something like that , only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had lately stole out of the hospital . So it was bad . It was so bad my mind just could not contain it , and every hour it seemed to be getting worse . I spent the next couple of days running back and forth between the jail and that lawyer , and I had to haul Davey along with me wherever I went . He was too little for school and I could n't find anybody to take him right then , though all that running around made him awful cranky . Patrick was just grim , he would barely speak . He already knew pretty well for sure that he 'd be going to prison . The lawyer had told him there was n't no use in getting a bondsman , he might just as well stay on in there and start pulling his time . I do n't know how much he really saved himself that way , though , since what they ended up giving him was twenty-five years . That was when all my troubles found me , quick . Two days after Patrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought at first it was a bad cold or the flu . My nose kept running and I felt so wore out I could n't hardly get up off the bed and yet at the same time I feltreal restless , like all my nerves had been scraped bare . Well , I did n't really connect it up to the fact that I 'd popped the last pill in the house a couple of days before . What was really the matter was me coming off that Dilaudid , but I did n't have any notion of that at the time . I was laying there in bed not able to get up and about ready to jump right out of my skin at the same time when Davey got the drawer underneath the stove open . Of course he was getting restless himself with all that had been going on , and me not able to pay him much mind . All our pots and pans were down in that drawer then , and he began to take them out one at a time and throw them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racket , and the shape 1 was in , I felt like he must be doing it on purpose to devil me . I called out to him and asked him to quit . Nice at first : " You stop that , now , Davey , Momma do n't feel good . " But he kept right ahead . All he wanted was to have my attention , I know , but my mind was n't working right just then . I knew I should get up and just go lead him away from there , but I could n't seem to get myself to move . I had a picture of myself doing the right thing , but I just was n't doing it . I was still lying there calling to him to quit and he was still banging those pots around and before long I was screaming at him outright , and starting to cry at the same time . But he never stopped a minute . I guess I had scared him some already and he was just locked into doing it , or maybe he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pot it felt like 1 was getting shot at . And the next thing 1 knew I got myself in the kitchen someway and I was snatching him up off the floor . To this day 1 do n't remember doing it , though I have tried and tried . I thought if I could call it back then maybe I could root it out of myself and be shed of it for good and all . But all I ever knew was one minute I was grabbing a hold of him and the next he was laying on the far side of the room with his right leg folded up funny where it was broke , not even crying , just looking surprised . And I knew that it had to be me that threw him over there because as sure as hell is real there was nobody else around that could have done it . I drove him to the hospital myself . I laid him straight on the front seat beside me and drove with one hand all the way so I could hold on to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brave the whole time , never cried the least bit , just kept a tight hold on my hand with his . Well , after a while , we got there and they ran him off somewhere to get his leg set and pretty soon the doctor came back out and asked me how it had happened . It was the same hospital where Patrick had worked and I even knew that doctor a little bit . the one you pick is bad enough . DO as much as step in the road one time without looking , and your life could be over with then and there . But during those two years 1 taught myself to believe that this mistake of mine could be wiped out , that if I struggled hard enough with myself and the world I could make it like it never had been . Three weeks went by after I went to see that social worker , and I did n't have any idea what was happening , or if anything was . bid n't call anybody , I expect I was afraid to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the TOA . It was the lawyer and I could tell right off from the sound of his voice I was n't going to care for his news . Well , he told me all the evaluations had come in now , sure enough , and they were n't running in our favor . They were n't against me , he made sure to say that , it was more like they were for the Bakers . And his judgment was it would n't pay me anything if we went on to court . It looked like the Bakers would get Davey for good anyhow , and they were likely to he easier about visitation if there was n't any big tussle . But if I drug them into court , then we would have to start going back over that whole cast history That was the word he used , case history , and it was around about there that I hung up . I went walking stiff-legged back across to the counter and just let myself sort of drop on a stool . Prissy had been covering my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right over to me then . " What is it ? " she said . I guess she could tell it was something by the look on my face . " I lost him , " I said . " Oh , hon ' , you know I 'M so sorry , " she said . She reached out for my hand but I snatched it hack . I know she meant it well but I just was not in the mood to be touched . " There 's no forgiveness , " I said . I felt bitter about it . It had been a hard road for me to come as near forgiving myself as I acted when we were together . And if us two could do it , I did n't feel like it ought to be anybody else 's business but ours . Tim walked up then and Prissy whispered something to him , and then he took a step nearer to me . " I 'm sorry , " he told me . " Not like 1 am , " I said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go ahead and take off the rest of your shift if you feel like it , " he said . " I 'll wait on these tables myself , need be . " " I do n't know it would make any difference , " I said . " Better take it easy on yourself , " he said . " No use in taking it so hard . You 're just going to have to get used to it . " " Is that a fact ? " I said . And I lit Myself a cigarette and turned my face away . We had been pretty busy , it was lunchtime , and the people were getting restless seeing all of us standing around there not doing a whole lot about bringing them their food . Somebody called out something to Tim , I did n't hear just what it was , but it set off one of his temper fits . " Go on and get out of here if that 's haw you feel , " he said . He was getting red in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he was saying . " Go on and clear out of here , every last one of you , and we do n't care if you never come back , There 's not one of you could n't stand to miss a meal anyhow . Take a look at yourselves , you 're all fat as hogs .. . . " It seemed like he might be going to keep it up a good while , and he had already said I could leave , so I hung up my apron and got my purse and I left . It was the first time he ever blew up at the customers that way , it had always been me or Prissy Or one of the cooks . I never did find out what came of it all because I never went back to that place again . I drove home in such a poison mood I barely knew I was driving a car or that there were any others on the road . I was ripe to get killed or kill somebody , and I would n't have cared much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said about having to get used to it . It came to me that I was used to it already , I really had n't been all that surprised . That 's what I 'd been doing all those months , just gradually getting used to losing my child forever . When I got back to the apartment I just fell in a chair and sat there staring across at the kitchen wall . It was in my mind to pack my traps and leave that place , but I had n't yet figured out where I could go . I sat there a good while , I guess . The door was ajar from me not paying attention , but it was n't cold enough out to make any difference , If I turned my head that way I could see a slice of the parking lot . I saw Susan drive up and park and come limping to-STORY 71 ward the building with an armload of groceries . Because of the angle I could n't see her go into their apartment but I heard the door open and shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kept on sitting there thinking about how used to everything l had got . There must have been generous numbers of other people too , I thought , who had got themselves accustomed to all kinds of things . Some were used to taking the pain and the rest were used to serving it up . About half of the world was screaming in misery , and it was n't anything but a habit . When I started to hear the hitting sounds come toward me through the wall , a smile came on my face like it was cut there with a knife . I 'd been expecting it , you see , and the mood I was in I felt satisfied to see what I had expected was going to happen . So I listened a little more carefully than I 'd been inclined to do before . It was hit hit hit going along together with a groan and a hiss of the wind being knocked out of her . I had to strain pretty hard to hear that breathing part , and I could hear him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was about three minutes of that with some little breaks , and then a longer pause . When she hit the wall it was the hardest she had yet , I think . It brought down every last one of my pots at one time , including that big iron skillet that was the only one 1 ever used . It was the first time they 'd managed to knock that skillet down , and I was so impressed that I went over and stood looking down at it like I needed to make sure it was a real thing . I stared at the skillet so long it went out of focus and started looking more like a big black hole in the floor . That 's when it dawned on me that this was one thing I did n't really have to keep on being used to , It took three or four knocks before he came to the door , but that did n't worry me at all . I had faith , I knew he was going to come . I meant to stay right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the door wide and stood there with his arms folded and his face all stiff with his secrets . It was fairly dark behind him , they had all the curtains drawn . I had that skillet held out in front of me in both my hands , like maybe 1 had come over to borrow a little hot grease or something . It was so heavy it kept wanting to dip down toward the floor like a water witch 's rod . When I saw he was n't expecting anything , I twisted the skillet back over my shoulder like baseball players do their bats , and I hit him bang across the face as hard as I knew how . He went down and out at the same time and fetched up on his back clear in the middle of the room . Then I went in after him , with the skillet cocked and ready in case he made to get up . But he did n't look like there was a whole lot of fight left in him right then . He was awake , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it'seemed like I 'd knocked out a few of his teeth . I wish I could tell you I was sorry or glad , but I did n't feel much of anything really , just that high lonesome whistle in the blood I used to get when I took all that Dilaudid . Susan was sitting on the floor against the wall , leaning down on her knees and sniveling . Her eyes were red but she did n't have any bruises where they showed . He never did hit her on the face , that was the kind he was . There was a big crack coming down the wall behind her and l remember thinking it prbbably would n't be too much longer before it worked through to my side . " I 'm going to pack and drive over to Norfolk , " I told her . I had n't thought of it before but once it came out my mouth I knew it was what I would do . " You can ride along with me if you want to . With your looks you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Kwik Sack and blow it up . " She did n't say anything , just raised her head up and stared at me kind of bug-eyed . And after a minute 1 turned around and went out . It did n't take me any time at all to get ready . All I had was a suitcase and a couple of boxes of other stuff . The sheets and blankets I just pulled off the bed and stuffed in the trunk all in one big wad . I did n't care a damn about that furniture , I would have lit it on fire on a dare . When I was done I stuck my head back into the other apartment . The door was still open like 1 had left it . What was she doing but kneeling down over that son of a bitch and trying to clean off his face with a washrag . I noticed he was making a funny sound when he breathed , and his nose was still bleeding pretty quick , so I thought maybe I had broke it . Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on now if you 're coming , girl , " I said . She looked up at me , not telling me one word , just giving rile a stare out of those hig cow eyes of hers like I was the one had been beating on her that whole winter through . And I saw then that they were both of them stuck in their groove and that she would not be the one to step out of it . So I pulled back out of the doorway and went on down the steps to my car . I was speeding on the road to Norfolk , doing seventy , seventy-five . I 'd have liked to gone faster if the car had been up to it . I ca n't say I felt sorry for busting that guy , though I did n't enjoy the thought of it either . I just did n't know what difference it had made , and chances were it had made none at all . Kind of a funny thing , when you thought about it that way . It was the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other time I had n't meant to do it at all . This time I 'd known what I was doing for sure , but I still did n't know what I 'd done . ? 72 HARPERS MAGAZINE / FEBRUARY
