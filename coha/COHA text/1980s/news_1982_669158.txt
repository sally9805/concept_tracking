Similarly , the ' ' hard core ' ' of the current internees face prolonged detention  --  even though total numbers of those detained will probably continue to decline. // Only a dramatic and unexpected change in the situation here would alter this rigorous assessment , given to this correspondent during a high-level , wide-ranging review of Polish affairs . Neither the authorities nor the people are counting on any such sudden change. // Indeed , no one is daring to make even a long-range projection of when the country ' s tottering economy might show signs of revival ; and that is perhaps the most crucial element in the whole crisis. // Apparently the members of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski ' s regime here can envision only the most gradual climb back to normality . One gets the impression they feel they have brought the ship back to something of an even keel , but they are aware it would not take much to blow it over again. // Meanwhile , they are cautiously playing for time and defending their record so far  --  as other assertions made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency has attained its first goal . In the government view , the danger of confrontation , ' ' counterrevolution , ' ' and civil conflict has been removed . Order and a level of labor discipline has been restored . For the first time since 1980 the rate of industrial decline is showing signs of slowing down. // * No early headway toward agreement on the structure and charter of a revived trade union movement is anticipated . It is said openly that despite numerous official contacts with Solidarity activists  --  both in internment and outside  --  no progress has been made toward even a minimal accord that could serve as a basis for substantive talks. // Meanwhile , despite Archbishop Jozef Glemp ' s appeal for their early release , many internees appear set for a lengthy period in detention . This includes the Solidarity leadership , other principal activists , and their dissident political advisers . About half of those initially detained have now been released. // * The government claims that in numerous warnings throughout 1981 it had hinted that it might resort to martial law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so until the ' ' very last moments . ' ' And there is continued resentment of the ' ' instant ' ' assumptions by many in the West that martial law was imposed on the Polish nation at Russian behest . Officials bristle at suggestions that the Soviets were consulted before the event. // ' ' Martial law was a self-decision  --  a decision made by Poles , ' ' this writer was told firmly. // The same source said Poland ' s major ally was informed of that decision at the latest possible moment . Moreover , this senior source asserted forcefully , ' ' If our ( the government ' s ) warnings had been taken more seriously , maybe this decision would not have come about . Even after Radom we hoped the union would pull back from its extreme positions. ' ' // ( Radom was the site of a Solidarity meeting last December at which union radicals forced through a motion threatening a general strike against the authorities ' request for legislative curbs on industrial action. ) // ' ' The primate had warned Solidarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' This was the moment when it still was possible to avoid martial law . It is not we who are guilty  --  simply that we were not taken seriously. ' ' // All that , of course , is a matter of history . Today ' s question is : What next ? // Many Poles seem to have given up asking it . And the authorities are seen as offering little but generalities in reply , together with a process recalling last year ' s endless debates. // Parliament , for instance , is soon to legislate on reforms that  --  on the face of it  --  should put the private farm sector in better heart . But on the equally sensitive issue of unions , the authorities offer only broad postulates about ' ' independent self-governance ' '  --  and intimations of the kind of unions they are not prepared to consider. // The essential argument turns on structure . It will provoke the strongest objections from Solidarity at large as well as its interned leaders . The government is adamant there will be no return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and through which it developed into a social movement of tremendous popular appeal and power. // ' ' We recognize that the unions of the ' 80s must be different from those of pre-August 1980 , ' ' this writer ' s high-level source said . ' ' Independent . . . self-managing . . . . We can agree that they should have control functions ( i. e. , in economic fields over which Solidarity battled for wide watchdog participation with government agencies ) . We will not , however , agree to any regional structure , and they ( Solidarity ) so far remain attached to that concept. ' ' // Martial law is in its fourth month , and the government seems reconciled to a long haul . It is counting on a broad national rethinking of the problems and conflicts within Poland before definitive programs can be undertaken. // Officials answer suggestions that the present ' ' discussion ' ' processes are one-sided ( because the other party ' s hands are tied by internment , nonaccess to the news media , and so on ) by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more time. ' ' // ' ' They are not yet ready for cooperation , and today - at this juncture  --  we are not partners . They were threatening the demolition of our state and there still are indications that they are ready to reject the former policy. ' ' // There seems a reluctance to acknowledge that Lech Walesa is central to any consideration of the unions , at least at the outset. // The point was made by Archbishop Glemp in his sermon in a Warsaw suburb Sunday . He welcomed the release of some 3 , 000 internees so far and urged that the remainder , including Mr. Walesa , be freed . He said Walesa ' ' must be a central figure in the endeavor for national agreement and conciliation. ' ' // The immediate outlook is bleak , however , even though there is no significant evidence of organized underground opposition . A message purportedly from Zbigniew Bujak , one of the union ' s committee militants who is still at large , urges Solidarity members to participate in the discussion on the future unions. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solidarity ' s national leadership remains in custody ? // //
