Among the flashy hardware and software on display at last week 's First World Supercomputer Exhibition in Santa Clara , Calif. , the small Cornell National Supercomputer Facility booth attracted attention out of proportion to its size . There , on a large video screen , more than a thousand stars wheeled around a newly formed black hole , an incredibly dense , bizarre entity with gravity so strong that not even light can escape from it . As nearby stars were sucked in by its gravity , the hole grew . By the time the system stabilized , nearly half its stars were gone . Conventioneers were fascinated . <P> But not as much as some scientists were . Before their equations were converted into computer images , astrophysicists had predicted that only a tenth as many stars in such a system would be eaten by a black hole . This was no isolated case . Across the nation , in disciplines ranging from geophysics to medicine to entomology , scientists are discovering that computer images can sometimes lead to a better understanding of nature . Borrowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cases hiring Hollywood technicians ) , they are converting their data into video form . Because the human brain is exquisitely adept at picking up visual cues , scientists have begun benefiting from what Robert Langridge of the University of California at San Francisco calls " computer-aided insights . " Says Langridge , who uses 3-D graphics to model biological molecules : " Computer graphics gives us a window into what is going on , rather than just a scientific result . It has become an experimental tool . " <P> At the University of Massachusetts in Amherst , mathematicians plot complex equations on a computer-graphics terminal , which translates the numbers and symbols into form and color . Watching a curving , perforated object take form on the screen , the mathematicians gradually become convinced that they have produced a new shape with a jawbreaking name : a complete embedded minimal surface with finite topology . Previously only three such shapes were known to exist ; topologists have sought and speculated about a fourth for two centuries , but until this moment it has never been proved to exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such surfaces . <P> In West Lafayette , Ind. , a Purdue University biologist who until recently was building models of viruses by laboriously fastening together hundreds of brass fittings taps away at a computer keyboard . When he is done , he has created on the screen an image of rhinovirus 14 ( one of some 113 varieties responsible for the common cold ) that can be turned and viewed in three dimensions . Rhinovirus 14 thus becomes the first animal virus of any kind to have its full portrait drawn . <P> The growing need for electronic imagery rises from the sheer number- crunching power of computers like those shown in Santa Clara . Says Craig Upson , a graphics specialist who last August left a commercial animation firm to join the staff of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois : " You find yourself lost in this maze of data because suddenly you can compute far more than you can comprehend . " The route to comprehension , he says , is to turn the numbers into images .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
