Fokker 's challenge to Boeing <P> When it comes to flying high , few businessmen can measure up to Frans Swarttouw , 49 , of The Netherlands . Having built Rotterdam 's containership terminal into a key operation of the world 's biggest and busiest deepwater port , Swarttouw took command three years ago of Holland 's weak and floundering Fokker aircraft company and promptly set about developing a strategy to propel it into the front ranks of the world 's airframe manufacturers . <P> Last week in Amsterdam , Swarttouw announced that Fokker ( 1980 sales : $450 million ) and McDonnell Douglas Corp . of St. Louis ( 1980 sales : $6.06 billion ) were preparing to link up and build a Fokker-designed 150-seat , medium-range passenger jet . The companies hope the plane will grab a share of the emerging new replacement market for the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 , the Boeing 737 and the Boeing 727 , the aging workhorse of airlines from Singapore to Stockholm . <P> Analysts estimate the replacement market to be worth $55 billion , yet neither Fokker nor McDonnell Douglas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plane from the wheels up .

The new venture will be a giant gamble , but Swarttouw calmly says , " There are two ways to go broke . Do nothing , or do something . " <P> Boeing and Lockheed both expressed interest in Fokker 's designs , but Lockheed lacked sufficient funds to go ahead with the project , while Boeing proposed a deal that would have relegated Fokker to the role of a subcontractor . In McDonnell Douglas , Swarttouw found a perfect fit . The deal was finally cut during three months of secret meetings earlier this year , many of them taking place in hotel rooms booked under the name of a nonexistent corporation called Pegasus Inc . <P> Other airframe makers are also eager to grab a piece of the replacement market . Yet not even Boeing , which has manufactured 55% of all commercial planes now in service in the non-Communist world , can afford the escalating prices of building a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussing plans with potential Japanese partners to help pay the development costs . But last week Swarttouw was also in Japan looking for another partner .
