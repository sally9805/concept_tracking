Whatever it is , " Who ' s Who ? " was done in London in 1973 . It is about two men who take their mistresses to a hotel in Brighton for what one of them calls " a dirty weekend . " You see only one of the mistresses , however ; the fourth character is the wife of one of the men . Margo McKee , the producer , said she had negotiated for the American rights to the play for the last year , and that earlier attempts to bring it to New York apparently had foundered . Mrs. McKee , who has worked in various ways Off Broadway , although never as a producer , also said that " Who ' s Who ? " would be done with British actors in a " middle house . " A middle house has about 500 seats , and is neither on Broadway nor off , but somewhere in between. // Meanwhile , Mr. Randall flew to Nova Scotia yesterday , where he has a kind of reciprocal arrangement with John Neville and the Mermaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star in Alexander Ostrovsky ' s " Diary of a Scoundrel . " Last year , he directed Ibsen ' s " The Master Builder , " with Mr. Neville starring . Earlier , he starred in Chekhov ' s " The Sea Gull , " with Mr. Neville directing. // And what makes a good director ? Mr. Randall offered as succinct an answer as you are likely to hear . " A good director sees the play as a whole , " he said . " He sees it in a moment , the way you see a painting on the wall . Then he nudges the actor along , so the actor thinks he ' s seeing it for himself . You never tell an actor what to do . Line readings are the worst . They ' re awful. " // " Lolita , " which was to have been opened for inspection by the critics next Wednesday , will now invite the critics on March 19 , Jerry Sherlock , the producer , said yesterday . The play , an adaptation by Edward Albee of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Boston , went back in rehearsal in New York for one week , then started playing previews - at regular performance prices - at the Brooks Atkinson last Friday night . Nonetheless , this week Mr. Albee rewrote part of the second act . " You got lost in the last three scenes , " Mr. Sherlock said . " That part was in trouble . What do I do ? " // Whatever Mr. Sherlock does , however , he will do it without either Frank Dunlop , the director , or Mr. Albee . Mr. Dunlop will be in San Francisco this weekend for the opening there of " Camelot " with Richard Burton , which he also directed . Then Mr. Dunlop is going to London , the press agent for " Lolita " said , for a few days on business . Simultaneously , the press agent said , Mr. Albee is going off for 10 or 12 days of speaking engagments . He leaves on Monday. // From the beginning , of course , " Lolita " has inspired a certain amount of notoriety , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a critic who loved the play berated a critic who hated it . Meanwhile , the Boston radio stations declined to use " Lolita ' s " original commercials , apparently deciding they were risque . " Lolita " broke the box office record at the Wilbur Theater both weeks it was there. // Last week , Donald Sutherland , who stars in " Lolita , " seemed to suggest that the play might not even open officially in New York at all . On television , he spoke about " Breakfast at Tiffany ' s . " That show , Mr. Albee ' s adaptation of Truman Capote ' s novel , closed in previews . Almost simultaneously , items in newspaper columns suggested that the best seats for " Lolita " at the Brooks Atkinson were on the right side of the theater . Blanche Baker , who plays Lolita , gets undressed while facing to her left . Last Friday and Saturday , " Lolita " set another box office record : $46 , 301 for three previews. // Gerald S. Krone , who co-founded the Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for most of the time since , will leave at the end of this season to pursue other activities . Leon Denmark , the general manager of the Ensemble Company , will replace him . " I love the company , but I can ' t keep it up on a day-to-day basis , " Mr. Krone said . He said he would remain on the company board. // Meanwhile , it is likely that the troupe will again do Samm-Art Williams ' s " Home , " which originated at the N.E.C. , and won a Tony nomination as best play when it moved to the Cort Theater on Broadway last season . " Home " goes on tour this weekend . The company ' s regular season ends on April 26 , approximately when the tour is over . The notion is to alternate performances of " Home " then with performances of Charles Fuller ' s " Zooman and the Sign .

His father , who is British , had gone to school with Michael Redgrave and Emlyn Williams , and thought of becoming an actor himself . He did not , although the idea of acting was always around his son . Mr. Waterston , who is co-starring with Gilda Radner in " Lunch Hour , " says he was never taught how to act , however , until his Yale junior year , which he spent in Paris. // " I took a class with John Berry , the blacklisted director , " Mr. Waterston said . " He taught a mixture of Michael Chekhov , Stanislavsky and some of his own stuff . He was the best teacher I ever had . I had decided that I would not be an actor . Paris settled it for me that I would. " // But even after that , said Mr. Waterston , who was in his dressing room at the Ethel Barrymore , he often thought of packing it in . " I remember one time , I was living in New England , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got an application to architects ' school . But the worst time in my life was when my first marriage broke up . I had $250 in the bank , and no way to meet my alimony payments . And I had to admit that I couldn ' t take care of my son " // Mr. Waterston smiled - ruefully . " I had even driven my car under another car - demolished it , " he continued . " I didn ' t know what to do about anything . So I decided to go to California and look for work in television - make money . Then Joe Papp called and offered me Laertes in Stacy Keach ' s ' Hamlet . ' I explained that I had to make money , and Joe said he understood . And then two days later he called me and said Laertes and then Benedick in ' Much Ado . ' Well , that was a fish - no , what ' s the expression ? - a horse of a different color. 110t was the kickoff for everything I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less ruefully . " Once you ' ve been through all that , you learn how thin the ice is , " he said . " As an actor , you learn about insecurity . But maybe that ' s the way real life is . Maybe the other - the steady life - maybe that ' s the illusion. " // But even knowing that , Mr. Waterston is asked , is there still some disappointment in his career , some lingering regret , some memory that won ' t go away ? Maybe it was Michael Cimino ' s " Heaven ' s Gate , " which died when it was first released ? Mr. Waterston was one of its stars. // " The worst thing was getting a big , interesting part - the Duke in ' Measure for Measure ' and then having to admit I screwed it up , " he said . " I could never get it right. " //
