Carefully setting the stage for a U.S. visit <P> It will be his first visit to Washington since he called on Lyndon Johnson in 1966 , and Philippines President Ferdinand E. Marcos is determined that everything will be perfect . He appointed his brother-in-law , Benjamin Romualdez , as Ambassador to Washington expressly to handle the U.S. trip . In recent weeks , Manila 's leading corporations and advertising agencies have dispatched their top public relations executives to convince the skeptical U.S. media that Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos , who are scheduled to set foot on the White House lawn this week , are just about the best friends that Washington has in Asia . <P> Crucial friends to be sure : Clark Air Force Base and Subic Naval Base , the major U.S. military facilities in the Philippines , are vital staging areas for forces in the Pacific , a point that Imelda Marcos delights in driving home . " The Americans need us more than we need them , " she told TIME . " They do n't realize that if they lose their last bastion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . We will not allow the U.S. to treat us shabbily . " President Ronald Reagan , who has down-played human rights issues since taking office , is exempt from that resentment . " I am a fan of President Reagan , " the Philippine First Lady says . " He has gotten back the credibility , prestige and friendship that America had lost . " <P> Marcos has taken pains to demonstrate his own credibility as a man clearly in command . Briskly settling affairs at home before his departure , he has moved sharply against alleged opponents and buttressed his regime with a succession plan that already bears the marks of a dynasty . At his prodding , the Philippine legislature last week approved a law clarifying constitutional provisions for a 15-member Executive Committee that would succeed him in the event of his death or disability . Last month Marcos appointed his wife to a spot on the new Executive Committee , thus entrenching her as the most likely person to dominate it and-though he denies it-perhaps even to emerge as President . Yet Marcos reinforced speculation about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for pneumonitis ( incipient pneumonia ) just after telling a press conference that he had come through a checkup " with flying colors.
