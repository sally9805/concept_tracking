Hold the Chablis . The belated telephone call may have been the topper , but Dukakis has failed to connect with Jesse Jackson on more mundane matters . At a dinner on July 4 , the Governor served poached salmon and California Chablis . Jackson prefers his fish fried and lemonade to drink . <P> A dream ticket for the G.O.P. ? The more George Bush cites " compatibility " as a quality in a running mate , the less chance Bob Dole has of being picked . At a recent rally in Atlanta , Dole arrived an hour late , cooling the crowd that was ready to cheer the waiting Bush . When Dole was applauded , he joked , " Well , I 'd be willing to accept the nomination , but it left without me . " Complained a Bush aide : " He still ca n't accept that it 's over . " <P> Not in the know . The reporters following Dukakis organized a pool on his Veep choice . The bets : John Glenn , 13 ; Al Gore , 6 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " The most unhappy I ever saw Hubert Humphrey was when he was Vice President . " <P>  --  Lloyd Bentsen , disparaging the Veep job in May <P> Keep your distance , Duke . Negotiating a pre-convention Nightline interview , Dukakis aides wanted their man seated next to Ted Koppel , as Gary Hart had been . Koppel wanted the Duke in a separate studio . Unable to resolve the dispute , the Dukakis camp canceled the interview . <P> Consolation prizes . Unless Jackson really wants a Cabinet job in a Dukakis Administration , Mario Cuomo is one leading Democrat who believes such a post would be too restrictive for Jackson 's wide-ranging talents . Explains the New York Governor : " I 'd rather see him free to move around and be involved in a whole series of issues . " As for Dukakis ' choice of a running mate , Cuomo notes , " I would not have chosen Bentsen . But now that he made that choice and you see the reaction , you say to yourself , ' The Dukakis people are smarter than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclusiveness . He has gone beyond his own ideological agenda . "
