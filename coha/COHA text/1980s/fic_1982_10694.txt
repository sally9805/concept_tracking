PELICANS with dark freckled feathers flew low over the green sea in formation like a squadron of hedge clippers . Father said , " I hate those birds . " There were gulls and vultures , too . " There 's something about a coast that attracts scavengers , " he said . There was a cow on the beach , and railway boxcars on the pier , and the low town of La Ceiba looked yellow and jammed . Hundreds of men met our ship , not to welcome us but to quarrel with each other . Everything was backward here . Father said , " You kids can go on ahead  --  you 've got your knapsacks , " but we were so alarmed by the heat and noise we waited for him to finish with the passport officialand load his tools and seed bags into a black man 's cart . Then we followed with Mother , who seemed to be holding her breath . The Spellgoods , still gospeling , were met by a troop of black girl choristers in pink dresses and tipped-back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like the Bummicks  --  a boy , a woman , and two old men in khaki . There were wooden motor launches tied up at the pier , taking on crates of dried soup and sacks of rice . They had canvas awnings instead of cabins , and names like Little Haddy and Lucy and Island Queen . I never saw so many people doing nothing except sitting and standing and calling names . But where the pier met the main road , they were selling baskets of fruit and greaseballs wrapped in green leaves . There was a fat black woman in a torn dress with a white cockatoo on her shoulder . She wore a dirty pair of blue bedroom slippers and was selling oranges . Father bought six oranges and said to us , " How much were these at the A and P in Springfield ? "  |p102Clover  said , " Thirty-nine cents each . " " And I just bought six for a quarter . I guess we came to the right place ! " Father plunged through the crowd , and Mother said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him go . " He hurried to the beach , and when we caught up with him he said , " I ca n't see anyone invading this town . I really ca n't imagine landing-craft on this beach . Can you , Mother ? " " Why would they bother ? " " That 's what I mean . " He said he wanted to walk down and feel the sand between his toes . The black man remained on the road with our belongings in his cart . He looked as if he was used to waiting . We walked past a long low building that faced the ocean . In front of it , on the beach , a boy with a rifle was watching two other boys digging a deep pit in the sand . Father said the diggers were prisoners  --  that low building was the Central Jail . " In the States , jailbirds like them are watching TV , so do n't tell me digging holes is torture . They 're just burying their grievances . " The cow was ambling slowly toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had never seen a cow so skinny , and what was a cow doing here ? Nearby , a dog was gnawing the skull of what looked like another dog . The sea was brown , the lazy waves flipped plastic bottles , and rags , and hacked-open coconuts onto the blackish sand . Standing at the rail of the Unicorn , I had seen this beach as dazzling white , but up close the digging prisoners , the cow , the dog snarling at the skull  --  all these and the stinking air gave it the atmosphere of a crusted and crazy jungle shore . The Mosquito Coast , Father had called it  --  it was a good name . Barefoot people watched us , but no one swam in the water . One man down the beach threw a limp round net into the low waves . Then he dragged it out , shook its sinkers , and held it in his teeth while he untangled it . And he threw it in again . I watched him do this eight times not even a minnow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people calling out on the pier , and the clang of the ship 's booms . The Unicornlay yellowing in the setting sun . I was sorry we were not still on it . We trudged past the man with the net to where the shacks were banked against the beach . People lived in them , though they werep103no better than woodsheds and would not have done for chicken houses because of the loosely slatted boards and leaky-looking roofs . But humans were in them , cooking and sleeping I saw their tires and their hammocks . Walking was hazardous here because of the shacks . From each back door there was a furrow of black water stretched across the sand  --  slime , suds , and worse , spewing into the sea . The beach was their junkyard and the sea was their sewer . Mother said , " Allie , I 've seen enough . " But walking back to the road and our cart in the twilight , we heard music . We saw a boy with a flute stumbling toward us . He played a warbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach , as purply-blue as the sky over the sea . It was a strange song , with a trickling melody , and it sweetened the air like raindrops . The boy was a shadow , and his flute no bigger than a twig , but the song was an invitation for us to stay a little longer on this Mosquito Coast . It had in it a promise and a plea , liquefied like the freshet of chirps from an oriole in a leafy tree . Then he was gone and there were sharp voices in the sudden darkness . I was afraid . We were so far from home . Father and Mother walked ahead of us , holding hands and whispering . We children followed and I thought , What now ? Jerry said , " It 's junk , it stinks , it 's crappo , I hate it . " " Do n't let him hear you , " I said . We entered the town at night , under the bright barnacled moon , and it was magic  --  the halos on old lampposts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets , and the snuffle of traffic . We went to a hotel , and from our bedroom the town was like velvet . I imagined the whole place to be made out of green pillows , creepy-'l uiet and cool . I dreamed of meadow grass and rolled over , put my arms out , and flew in buttery light over places I knew . I could often fly in my dreams  --  not high , but high enough so that people had to watch me with upturned faces . It was a lovely night and coming at the end of that stormy sea voyage , it was like arriving home . But in the morning , birds I could not name yattered against thep104windows , and in the darkness of the dusty room cracks of sun showed in the shutters . I opened the shutters and saw that the town was burst open by the sunlight . It was cracked and discolored and mobbed by people actually screaming above the braying car horns . There was no magic now , nor even anything familiar . The smells and sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was so hot I could smell the old paint on the windowsill . I had been fooled , and hated the sight of it . It had taken so long to get there even if we left now it would be days before we could get back to our own house . Mother and Father were in another room . We kids looked out of our own window at the town of small stores . There was a heavy whitewashed church across the palm-tree park in which men in hats were standing , doing nothing . The radio music in the street the street !  --  was so loud the noise seemed to heat the air . I remembered the dismal beach , the boy prisoners shoveling sand , and one up to his shoulders in the hole . I had expected trees , jungle , stillness , and flitting birds . Father had promised us something better than home , not this dusty place . It was like a nightmare of summer ruin , a town damaged by sunlight . The hotel smelled of its carpets and its kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a bare cell , but on one wall was a colored picture , probably cut from a gas-station calendar , of a New England scene  --  woods , a pond mirroring a green mountain , and a red canoe on the pond . Whoever cut it out and pasted it into the frame knew that it was prettier than this town . Jerry said , " It looks like Lake Wyola . " Father roused us . He blew cigar smoke into our room and said he was famished . " He 's still happy , " Clover said . But as we approached the hotel dining room for breakfast , we heard singing  --  " God who gave us Jeedoof 's weal . . . " It was the Spellgoods , they were also staying here , singing with bowed heads over their helpings . Emily stopped scratching when she saw me . The dining room of this hotel was like the dining room on the Unicorn , the Spellgoods at two tables , we at ours , and some Bummick-like fruit-company workers at other tables , all starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rev. Speligood said . " I guess the good Lord intends for us to team up after all ! If you 're going to be in the area any length of time , you scoop up your family and pay us a visit . You 'll find us in Guampu , doing the Lord 's work . "  | " The Lord has n't mentioned Guampu to me , " Father said . " I wish He would get in touch , though . I could give Him a few pointers i f He 's planning any other worlds . He certainly made a hash of this one . " Rev. Spellgood said sadly , " Friend , there 's a lot of work to be done . " " So I noticed . " " You never did tell me what you 're aiming to do here , " Rev. Spellgood said . " You 're absolutely right , Gurney . I never did tell you . " With that , Father sat down , and we had breakfast , which was mashed beans , like red clay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a heap of hot tortillas . Father said , " We 're getting out of here . " " This town ? " Mother asked . " This hotel . Half the people in this room are packing guns . Even old Gurney 's got one he 's wearing a pistol under his shirt . So much for putting on the whole armor of the Lord . I 've been outside . It 's all soldiers and shoeshine boys . I do n't know which is worse , them or the missionaries . " Across the room , Emily Spellgood was staring at me . " I do n't see why we have to hang around , " Mother said . " We could be on the road . " " There are n't any roads  --  that 's the beauty of this country , " Fathersaid . " But we 're not the Swiss Family Robinson , and we 're not squatters . I 'm going to buy a piece of land , cash down . I do n't want any of these gunslingers giving me the bum 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll be on our lonesome , and I do n't care if  --  oh , Gaw , here he comes again . " It was Rev. Spellgood , leading his family out of the dining room . He winked at Father and said , " Guampu . " Emily sneaked behind my chair and whispered , " I 'm going to the bathroom , Charlie . " " Charlie 's blushing ! " Jerry said . We moved that very day in pelting rain to another hotel , called The Gardenia , at the eastern edge of La Ceiba , on a sandy road next to the beach . Still the rain came slapping down , tearing the leaves off the trees . It was straight , loud , thick , and gray , and it stopped as quickly as it began . Then there was sunlight and steam , and a returningodor.  |p106The  Gardenia was a two-story building covered with stucco in which cracks showed through the faded green paint . Its long piazza faced the sea and gave us a good view of the pier , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope . Men 's voices and the racket of conveyor belts and bucking freight cars carried across the water . During the day , we were the only people at The Gardenia , but at night , just before we went to bed , women gathered on the piazzaand sat in the wicker armchairs drinking Coca-Cola . Later , there was music and laughing , and from our room I heard men and shouts and slamming doors , and sometimes glass breaking . I never saw this crowd , though I was often woken by it  --  by tramping feet and songs and screams . In the morning , everything was quiet . The only person around was an old woman with a broom sweeping the mess into a pile and taking it away in a bucket . The manager of this hotel was an Italian named Tosco . He wore a silver bracelet and pinched our faces too hard . He had once lived in New York . He said it was like hell . Father said , " I know just what you mean . " Tosco liked Honduras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything you wanted here , he said . " What 's the president like ? " Father asked . " He is the same as Mussolini , " Tosco said . This name darkened Father 's face , and with the shadow of the word still on it , he said , " And what was Mussolini like ? " Tosco said , " Tough . Strong . No fooling . " He made a fist and shook it under Father 's chin . " Like this . " " Then he 'd better keep out of my way , " Father said . Father spent part of every day in town , and while he was there , Mother gave us lessons on the beach , under thundery skies . It was like play . She wrote with a stick on the damp sand , setting us arithmeticproblems to solve , or words to spell . She taught us the differentkinds of cloud formation . If we chanced upon a dead fish , she poked it apart and named each piece . There were flowers growing beneath the palms  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts in the blossoms . Back in Hatfield , we had studied indoors , to avoid the truant officer , but I preferred these outdoor lessons , studying whatever we happened to find on the beach . She was not like Father . Father lectured us , but she never made speeches . When he was around she gave him her full attention , but when he was in town she was ours . She answered all our questions ,  |p107even  the silliest ones , such as " Where does sand come from ? " and " How do fish breathe ? " Usually when we returned to The Gardenia , Father was on the piazzawith someone from town . " This is Mr. Haddy , " he would say . " He 's a real old coaster . " And the prune-skinned man would rise and creakily greet us . There was nothing Juanita Shumbo did n't know about rearing turkeys  --  she was an old black woman with red eyes . Mr. Sanchez had splashed up and down the Patuca  --  he was tiny and brown and had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Father said , and he made that man sneeze a Zambu salutation . There were many others , and each of them listenedclosely to Father . They were respectful and seemed , sitting nervously on their chairseats out of the sun , to regard him with admiration . " He 's wonderful with strangers , " Mother said . But the strangers made me uneasy , for I had no clear idea of Father 's plans , or how these people fitted in . I wished I had Father 's courage . Lacking it , I clung to him and Mother , for everything I had known that was comfortable had been taken away from me . The other kids were too young to realize how far we had drifted from home . Except for the Unicorn , still at the pier , the past had been wiped away . Coming back from the beach one afternoon , we saw Tosco at the hotel , talking to his Chevrolet . He asked it questions and called it improper names . He stood near its radiator grill and shouted and cuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stupid , " he said , wagging his foot in pain . " She no want to go . She hate me . " " My husband will fix it . " And that evening , with one of his new friends it was Mr. Haddy  --  Father did fix it . He said machines had bodies but no brains . Mr. Haddy stared , as if Father had said something wise . Tosco was so grateful for the repair work he said we could use the car anytime we liked . The next day , Mother said she wanted to take us for a drive , while Father was occupied in town . Were we going to " Tela ? Tosco asked . No , Mother said , we were going east , toward " Trujillo . Tosco laughed . He said , " You will come back soon , " and gave Mother the keys . " Which road do I take ? " He said , " There is only one . "  |p108We  drove through town and at once I could see that it was both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken huts , like the shacks on the beach , but also large houses and green lawns . The best of them were surrounded by fences . That was the strangest thing to me , because the Connecticut Valley was a land without fences , except for horses and cows . It reminded me of what Captain Smalls had said about Honduras being like a zoo , only the animals were outside and the people inside the cages . But so far , we were outside . From this town road we came to the flat main road and turned left . We went less than half a mile before the road became rutted and filled with broken rocks . Ahead was a bridge across a river . It was a railway bridge , but there was no other . Cars took turns using it . Mother waited and then drove along the planks and railway tracks of this girder bridge . Below us , women were washing clothes in the cocoa-colored river . Beyond the bridge , the road gave out entirely . It was a wide mud puddle that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finally not a road at all , but a dry creek bed in which the rocks were higher than our front bumper . " This is the end of the line , " Mother said . We were a mile from The Gardenia . We tried other roads . One ended at the beach , another at a riverbank  --  the same riverbank as before  --  and a third became a quarry , which was part of a mountain . At the end of two of those roads , skinny barking dogs jumped at our windows . It was a town of dead ends . " I 'm not giving up this easily , " Mother said . We drove toward Tela , on the road to the west . The mountainsides were full of slender palm trees , and beneath them , where the land was flat , there were banana plantations and grapefruit trees and fields of spiky pineapples . Mother stopped the car , so that we could study the way bananasgrew , but when we got out of the car we saw a congregation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were baldheadedand watching a dog chewing the pink ribs of a dead cow . The dog had eaten his way under a rugflap of skin . The cow must have been hit by a car , Mother said , and the carcass pushed into the grass . Every so often a vulture would jump out of the flock  --  there were twenty-three in the congregation  --  and snatch at the hangingp109strips of meat and try to gouge them away . But the dog , growling and chewing , kept the vultures waiting , and most of the time these horrible-looking birds stared like witches in skullcaps . Their wings were like dragging skirts . Farther along this road we saw a dead dog . Five vultures were tearing at a hole in his belly . The vultures shuddered their wings and hopped aside to let our car pass . Then they returned to the dog 's body . Clover and April said it was making them sick , and could we go back ? So we did , without seeing Tela . That was Honduras , so far . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken huts and roads leading nowhere . The view from the ship had been like a picture , but now we were inside that picture . It was all hunger and noise and cruelty . Next to this , the grapefruits hardly mattered , and the sunshine only made it worse . Was it for this Father had swept us away from home ? Back at The Gardenia , Father was sitting on the piazza with anotherman  --  not one I had seen before . Seeing Mother , the man stood up unsteadily , and when he spoke , spit flew out of his mouth . " I am talking to your husband , " he said . " He is crazy . " " Crazy like a fox , " Mother said . There was a crack of thunder and a sizzle of rain on the roof . It was sudden and straight down , making poke marks in the sand . " This is the prettiest woman I see in my life , " the man said . Mother said , " You 're not very old . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Stick around , " Father said to me . " Meet Mr. Weerwilly . We 're talking real estate . " " Good , good , " the man said . " This is my oldest boy , Charlie . " Mr. Weerwilly cocked his head at me and said , " But I am German , so I call you Karl . You know what , Karl ? This man is crazy . " I looked at Father . He was grinning . I said , " No . " " Yes ! He is crazy ! I tell him this- is a rotten country . He says he likes it very much . This is crazy . You know , Karl , this is the last colony in the world , and I am one pee-sant in it . How many Germanshere ? Not more than twenty . But sousands of Americans  --  sousands ! " " Not in Jeronimo , " Father said . Mr. Weerwilly said , " He sinks Jeronimo is wonderful . This isp110crazy . He does n't know Jeronimo . Jeronimo is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is true . Four hundred dollars for one acre ? It would be much more here . " " You heard him , Charlie , " Father said , and set his eyes on Mr. Weerwilly . " When the road comes up , the price comes up , " Mr. Weerwilly said . " I have no money . I am a pee-sant . I have to sell you my land . " He began to laugh . " But what can you do in Jeronimo ? " " I can do what I want . " " You do not want very much . " I hated this man , I hated his loud voice . His thick tongue crowded his mouth and interfered with his words . He snatched at my knee and spit flew off his blubbery lips . " I am working with my hands alone , " he said . " The fruit companyhas machines . If I want to clear some land or thumsing I use a machete . The fruit has bulldozers . The fruit can spray insecticides from helicopters . Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worker too much  --  two lemps a day . What can I do ? For a stalk of bananas I get one lemp  --  one dollar only . One cent for an orange , and a grapefruit  --  one cent . " He gargled his beer and said , " That is why I am starving . Ptooi . " Father said to me , " He 's not starving . He 's got my money in his pocket . " " You are crazy , " Mr. Weerwilly said . I said , " I think I 'll go inside . " " You go , Karl , " Mr. Weerwilly said . " Bye-bye . " " Stay where you are , " Father said to me . " Ask him if he 's got my money in his pocket . " I began to ask , but Mr. Weerwilly made an ugly clownish face at me and squeezed my leg . " Know why I like this man , Karl ? Because he hates the fruit . And because he is not a missionary . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Sings ! " Mr. Weerwilly said . " He tells me how I can carry water up to my terraces . Even my friends do n't tell me that . So I like him . Also , he pays cash . " " You 're the witness , Charlie , " Father said . " Remember that . " " But we are different , " Mr. Weerwilly said . " You are an Americanimperialist . You take my land . I am a poor Communist , just ap111little pee-sant . I have to sell you . Now I have my house and some few trees . " Mr. Weerwilly went on talking . He repeated himself and lispedand spat and drank beer . The time passed slowly . Why did Fatherinsist that I sit here , with the rain spattering around us ? Mr. Weerwilly said , " But I know why you are taking that prettywoman and those children to Jeronimo . Because you are crazy . " " You heard the lady , " Father said . " Like a fox . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shirt only . You can get a girl for five lemps . " " Watch it , Weerwilly , " he said , and gave the man a wild grin . Father pointed angrily with his blown-off finger and made Mr. Weerwilly flinch . I suppose the man mistook Father 's blunt finger on the fist for the barrel of a gun . Mr. Weerwilly 's hand went to his shirt . Father said , " Charlie , ask the man where his contract is . " I asked this question . " Sank you , " Mr. Weerwilly said . " You help me to remember this sing . " He took an envelope from inside his shirt and let it plop on the table . Father tore it open . But I was not looking at him . I was staring at Mr. Weerwilly . When he parted his shirt to remove the envelope , his hand had brushed a black leather holster that was strapped across his chest . " He is in such a hurry . " Father said , " It looks like a Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I can read , " Father said . I could not take my eyes off the holster bulge in Mr. Weerwilly 's shirt . " He sinks I cheat him . " Father read it closely , frowning , pushing his finger stump across the page . Then he said , " It 's been a pleasure to do business with you . " Mr. Weerwilly finished his beer and belched . He stood up and gripped my hair and twisted my head so that I was facing him . He smiled at me in his ugly way and said , " Perhaps he is not so crazy . " Then he laughed , touching the bulge in his shirt.  |p112When  he had gone , Father said , " Thanks for sticking around , Charlie . Is n't he a sad case ? He was drunk . I did n't think he was going to give it to me . He could have walked away with my money . " Father folded the paper and returned it to the envelope . " He was playing hard-to-get . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Correct . He thought he had the drop on me . " " Were n't you frightened ? " He took my hand tenderly . His own hand was hot and gummy and trembled over mine . He said , " Nope . " He let go and reached for the envelope . " I got what I wanted . " " Some land ? " " Jeronimo , " Father said . " A town ? " " Wipe that grin off your face , " he said . " It 's a small town . " The rain squittered on the roof and beat on the hedge of hibiscus flowers , making the blossoms nod . It blackened the sand and drummed on Tosco 's Chevrolet , and thunder boomed on the inky sea . " Still , " Father said , " I 'll be the mayor . " We sat until the rain let up , then Mother and the kids joined us , and Tosco served us our dinner here on the piazza . Jerry said , " We saw a dead cow , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roadside , watched by vultures " with beaks like potato peelers . " Clover and April described the dead dog on the road , and the vultures there , jostling to peck pieces out of the carcass . Clover said , " They kept on beaking him until it made me feel sick . " " Father 's not impressed , " Mother said . " I ca n't bear those birds . " Mother told him about the roads , how you drove on ruts and trenches , how you had to cross a railway bridge on the slippery tracks and loose planks , and then it was too rocky to go any further ; how one road led to a quarry and another to the sea , and how the roads were not roads , and how after less than a mile you came to trees , or a dog , and usually a dead one . The roads led nowhere . " I 'll drink to that , " Father said . Clover said , " And people go to the bathroom on the street . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giggle . " I saw one ! "  | " That 's good for the rhubarb , " Father said . " All we saw was bananas , " Clover said . " He 's still smiling , " Mother said . " Tell them the news , Charlie . " I said , " Dad bought a town . " " A small one , " he said . " You 're joking , " Mother said . " Here 's the deed , " he said . " And I can show you the place on a map . The name 's right there in black and white  --  looks about the size of South Hadley . A drunken German sold it to me . He tried to grow bananas there , but lack of transport made the whole thing uneconomical . Anyway , he was probably drunk as a dog I would n't send him out for sandwiches . He was glad to get rid of it . Best of all , the whole thing 's secret . There 's no road , and no one goes there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , only sunshine . " Jerry said , " I 'll bet there 's a dead dog there . " " Maybe a live dog , " Father said . " But no dogcatcher . No policemen , no telephone , no electricity , no airfield nothing . It 's about as unimportant as a place can possibly be . That German was damningit , but it all sounded like praise to me . You talk about starting from scratch . Well , Jeronimo is scratch . " " How do we get there ? " Mother asked . " Do n't confuse me with trivial questions , " Father said . " But I 've said enough . Except for that German , there 's not a single soul betweenhere and the Land Office who knows where we 're going . From that point of view , it 's better than a desert island . " Up went his finger stump . " Mum 's the word . " Just then , a car drew up to The Gardenia and parked in a puddle . Four women in bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried handbags . They walked across the piazza to the bar at the end . I recognized their laughter . " Here come the ladies of the night , " Father said . " This meeting is adjourned . " Tosco approached Father as we were leaving to go to our rooms . He thanked him again for fixing his car , and repeated that we could use it anytime we wished . " You 're a gentleman , " Father said . Tosco said , " But you do n't need a car now , eh ? I hear you buy Jeronimo . " He kissed his fingertips . " Is beautiful , Jeronimo . " The nighttime noise was worse than usual , and it racketed almostp114until dawn . Then I looked across the sparkling harbor to the pier and saw that the Unicorn had sailed . The disappearance of the white ship left me feeling helpless and half blind , as if a handy thing had been tricked out of my head . It was hope . I had felt safe because the ship had been there  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After that , I never left Father 's side . I made every excuse to accompany him into town . I sat patiently in stores and warehouses while he bought equipment he said we would need in Jeronimo  --  hardware , he called it , pipes and fittings . The fruit company was selling it cheap , he said . I did as I was told and usually found myself squatting in the shade of a tree with the man named Mr. Haddy , while Father  --  inspecting racks of copper pipe or old boilers  --  gave his junk dealer 's speech about taking this scrap off their hands and saying he did n't have the slightest idea what he was going to do with it . " Seems a shame to throw it away , " he said , and acted as if he pitied them for having it and would do them the favor of removingit . I had heard all this before , but still I stayed near him . Our last link with America was broken with the sailing of the Unicorn . Fatherhad been partly right when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that old man would take care of us , and I had sometimes felt the same about Tiny Polski . But now Father was in sole charge . He had brought us to this distantplace and in his magician 's way surprised us by buying a town , and half a warehouse of copper pipe , and an acre of old boilers . " These are the raw materials of civilization , " he said . But I did not care about that . I just wanted to be near him . I feared the recklessnessof his courage and I remembered the German and the gun . If he dies , I thought , we are lost . Whenever he was out of sight , I got worried and did not stop worrying until I heard him whistling , or singing " Under the Barn , Under the . Boo . " He noticed me tagging after him . Often , he stooped over and said to me , " How am I doing ? " I said fine . But I did not know what he was doing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was doing it among the savages.  | " WHAT YOU taakin about ? " Mr. Haddy said . He was frogfaced and so bucktoothed the two front ones were bone-dry from sticking out . " The water is camera in the night . " " Not where I come from , " Father said . " It 's the same , day or night . So let 's go . " Mother said , " Whose boat is it , anyway ? " Mr. Haddy was still protesting to Father . " I do n't say you water is camera in the night  --  I say this water . Is mighty rough in the day , and sometime she rain like the devil . But in the night she a baby . " He licked his words lazily and spoke in a flat voice , with hiccups of emphasis , and he lapsed into Creole when Father became unreasonable . " No bin yerry , dat the way it is ? Tonda pillit me ! " " Just get us out of here , " Father said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us the whole entire day to load up this dum cargo on me lanch . " " Shake a leg then ! " " And she mightna fit , " Mr. Haddy said . " All them iron wares . " " We 'll experiment . " Mr. Haddy looked at Mother . " You man is a good one for spearmints , Ma . " It was not hard to move our belongings from The Gardenia to the pier where Mr. Haddy 's launch , Little Haddy , was moored . The bags of seeds , the camping equipment , the toolboxes  --  we trucked them over in one trip . But the boilers and pipes were another matter . At last , this heavier cargo came in a boxcar from town , trundling alongp116the main street rails of La Ceiba and down the pier , gathering a procession of people behind it as it went . " This spearmint bound to sink me lanch , " Mr. Haddy said . " She gung sink it , she gung . " The Little Haddy was a wooden motor launch with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had forty feet of open deck , part of it shaded by a canvas awning . Rubber tires hung over its hips for bumpers . Its paint was peeled and chipped and showed gray salty planks . Green fur grew on the hull below the water line , and it was altogether the sort of boat I had seen scuttled on mud flats or overturned above the tidemark on the Massachusetts coast . Even its ropes had the bleached and flimsy look of junked lines . Some of its deckboards had sprung up and freed the caulking , and in many places it was smeared with tar . The hold was so shallow Mr. Haddy had to kneel and bump his head to stow our gear , and it was quickly filled . The rest  --  the boilers , three of them , and the pipes  --  was to be roped to the deck . Each time something was hoisted on board , Little Haddy groaned and settled lower in the water and seemed to blow its nose . The people from town who had followed the boxcar stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loading . Father knew several of the onlookers by name . He joked with them in Spanish and English . Less than a week in La Ceiba and already he was known in a friendly way , respected even , although no one on the pier made a move to help him truss up this cargo and swing it onto the launch . Father howled from the effort of lifting , and said , " They do n't care if I rupture myself . " " But you could stay here , Uncle , " one of the watchers said . " I would n't stay here for anything , " Father said . He guided a bundle of place , La Ceiba . " Father said , " No place for kids . " " So many kids here ! " " Why is it , " Father said , walking toward the people and letting the sweat dribble off his face , " all these people growing fruit , pickingit , wrapping it , loading it , canning it , and everything else  --  why is it they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They do every/thing but eat it ! I 've never seen so many shrimps in my life . Skin and bones , that 's all I see . Admit it , you 're weaklings . " The people laughed and sort of cowered in the shadow of the boxcar . The noon sun beat on the iron pier , and at the end of it , where Jerry and the twins were playing , the pier was watery from the heat shimmer and as wavy as the sea . Pelicans drooped on posts , the shoreline blazed . Here , sunlight came down hard and jangled against the sand . " It 's a company town , " Father said . " A one-crop economy and a one-company crop . You can keep it . But I 'm not going to let my family starve here . " " We not starving , " one man said . " We strong folks fo ' too-roo . " He was a big man , with a rag tied around his head , and green tattooson his arm muscles , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're funny-bunnies and shrimps , " Father said . " You eat too many hamburgers , you polish your rice , you use white sugar . What you people need is vitamins . You "  --  he said to the big man , as he poked him in the chest  --  " you need lead in your pencil . " The man laughed out loud . He did n't mind Father 's abuse . He flexed his muscles for the crowd . " Okay , Samson , " Father said . " Want to do an experiment ? " " Another spearmint , " Mr. Haddy said , " and we still ai n't loaded me lanch . " " How many pushups can you do ? " Father said to the man . " Sumsun ! " yelled another man . The big man said , " I could lift that tub nah . " " Sure you can . You could scream it up and tip it over and probablymanage to take all your toes off . But how many pushups can you do , ape-man ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Haddy took her aside and said , " That big feller do n't wuth a dum bit of good . " " Clear a space , " Father said . " Give this gentleman air . " In the middle of the ring of onlookers , who shouted encouragement , the big man started . Father squatted in front of him and told him to touch his chin and keep his back straight . Father counted as the man cranked himself up and down . Then the man fell flat with a grunt and could not raise himself again.  | " Twenty-two , " Father said . " Not bad , but look at him he 's incoherent . " He hugged Mother and said , " My young bride could do that many before breakfast . " The man rolled over and picked himself up . He was narrow-eyed from panting , and he looked slightly crippled from the strain . " Hold these , " Father said . He handed me his baseball cap and his cigar . " Puppysho , " Mr. Haddy said  --  puppet show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled up his sleeves and got into position on the pier , the ramp of his back already soaked with sweat . Pumping his arms rapidly , he did twenty-two , while the onlookers counted . He stopped a moment , grinned at the big gasping man , and did twenty-eight more . " Fifty ! " he said . Then he did twenty-five more . When he stood up , his face was red and he was winded , but he said , " That 's seventy-five for starters . I could do lots more , but there 's work to do . " They loved him for that , and when he went back to loading the launch , eight men came forward to help . They spent the rest of the afternoon shifting the hardware with Father and Mr. Haddy . " It 's a funny thing , " Father said to Mother . " They 're helping me because they think I 'm strong . If I was weak they would n't lift a finger . You 'd think it 'd be the other way around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was n't wondering , " Mother said , and went to collect the kids . " On the other hand , " Father said , " it does n't matter if a fellow 's a savage , as long as he 's a gentleman . Remember that , Charlie . " Then he boarded the launch , chuckling to himself . Night fell . The town was kinder looking . Small lights burned on the pier , and windows shone in the harbor offices . The palms , so spindly and ragged during the day , had feathery heads , and these dark umbrella plumes sheltered the cozy buildings . Some blood-red sunset streaks were still bent across the mountains to the west . The town was tucked beneath . It lay flattened , a pool of tiny lamps in the darkness , and some dim spangles glimmered from the lighted huts on the mountainsides . Jerry was yawning miserably on Mother 's lap  --  he was too big to be comfortable there  --  and the twins were already asleep under the awning . It was ten o'clock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashed on the sea in sudden bursts . It seemed cruel to have to leave the town at this late hour . We were an early-to-bed family , and it was way past bedtime . I enviedthe people in the houses I could see  --  the ones at the windows and even those I imagined swinging in hammocks in the shacks next to the beach . It did not excite me to be on this narrow boat and listening to the sea flopping against its wooden hull , I sat on a box and shivered . Mother lay down with Jerry and the twins  --  they were all in sleeping bags . I looked ashore . I did not want to leave here . The motor had been stuttering slowly for the past hour . Mr. Haddy lifted a trap door , reached inside with a long-handled monkeywrench , and brought a loud rat-tat from the engine that made the broken deckboards shake . The gasoline fumes choked me . Father said , " I 've seen eggbeaters with better motors than this . Listen to it misfiring . Call that integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . I had been watching them since sundown . They had small sharp bodies and flat wings and careered around the pier 's lights , darting like swallows . " Some sort of nocturnal bird , " Father said , but he had not looked up . He was still frowning at the engine noise . " Them 's bats , " Mr. Haddy said . Hundreds of them  --  enough to darken the lights . Now I was eager to shove off in this boat . Father went forward . He said , " We 're about ready , Mother . I made you a coffee on the cookstove . " " I 've been ready all day , " she said . " The kids are asleep . " Mr. Haddy whistled fuzzily through his buckteeth . He said , " Yerry me , Ta Taam ? " and a man who had been sleeping on the pier rose up like a disturbed insect and untied the ropes and threw them onto the deck . Mr. Haddy blew out his cheeks and jammed a lever down  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gearshift on a tractor  --  and Ta Tom gave the boat a push with his foot . We were off , making for the black sea . " Yep . Them 's bats , " Mr. Haddy said . He leaned out of the wheel house . " Wish we was gung to Utila , " he said . I asked him why . " It 's only two hours . Santa Rosa 's ten . " He hung his long fingers on the wheel.  |p120I  said , " I thought we were going to Jeronimo . " " Jeronimo 's in the jungle . You do n't see no lanches there . Just fellers with tails . " " Do n't interrogate the man , " Father said . " Mind if I take a turn at the wheel , Mr. Haddy ? " Mr. Haddy did not budge from the wheel . In fact , he tightened his grip on the spokes . He said , " Against regulations . " " Which regulations ? " " Of me lanch . I 'm the steerer , you 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Mr. Haddy stayed where he was . Father said , " I know every lunar star in both hemispheres . I 'm master of the quadrant and sextant . I could take a meridian altitude of the sun from its reflection in a tar bucket . " " Regulations , " Mr. Haddy said . Father said , " And how many pushups can you do ? " This made Mr. Haddy laugh . But he did not let go of the wheel . He crowded it and put his nose against the dirty glass of the wheel house . The echo of our engine reached us from the palms on shore and rang against La Ceiba 's iron pier as we rounded it to head east , into deepest night . Father said , " We 've got gas , we 've got food , we 've got all our stuff . Plenty of drinking water and no perishables . I 'm damned glad to be going . No offense , Mr. Haddy , but that town is no place for children . " We looked back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fine . It was a shallow puddle of light beneath the shadows of mountains and the mops of storm-silvered cloud . " You know where you gung , Fadder . " " Mr. Haddy , we 're going home . Give me the wheel and we 'll get there in one piece . " Mr. Haddy hugged the wheel and steered us through the moonlit corrugations of sea . Father sighed . He licked a cigar  --  it was a long Honduran cigar . He had a whole basket of them . He set it alight , and the flame that spurted from its tip showed his fiery eyes to be burning on Mr. Haddy . " First deep-sea boat I 've ever seen without a compass aboard , " he muttered . " Lucky thing I brought mine . But I 'm not telling you where it is. "  |p121There  were small huts along the shore , flickering like lanterns under the tall palms . Then a greater darkness and tinier lights , and no shore but a blackening slope of land and sea and scanty flames in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Charlie , " Mr. Haddy said . " It ai n't carkles . " I did not say I was looking at the punctures of light on the shore . " When I was a little one , " he said , staring with me at the shore , " we live back of Brewer 's Lagoon . That 's where I learn Zambu  --  the Indian black fellers teached it to me . Along about one night , was a big disturbance in me room , a locomotion , fluttering and flapping . I woke up and called me ma , Ma , come quick ! Something happen ! ' She come in with a torch and say , Puppysho ! You wasting my time  --  dreaming bout Duppies . ' Duppies is your own ghost . Then she went all over gray . What that blood on you pilla ? ' she say , and did she screech . I look at the pilla and it is red . Blood ! She axed me was my head all right . It was bleeding , but I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked . " Hah ! ' me ma say , and she stamp on the floor , and a bat as big as a jacketman floops into the wall .

And the bat-shoo smell like mung . " He widened his brown-flecked eyes at me . " I know what you looking at . Bats . " I had not been , but now I was . Father was silent , smoking , looking as if he wanted to tear Mr. Haddy 's hands off the wheel . " I know a feller , " Mr. Haddy went on . " Bat sucked his toe , while he is asleep . Oh , bats , they just go at you . Big as pillas theirselves , some of them , out there . Down Bluefields way they come big as antsbears , bite through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see his dry teeth , white as paint , and hear him trying to whistle through them . " Fruit bats , " Father said . " Oh , sure , fruit bats , " Mr. Haddy said . " And all the other kinds . " " They eat bananas , " Father said . " But if they ai n't get their bananas , they just go at you . "  | " Tell us about the sharks , " Father said . " I seen some sharks , " Mr. Haddy said . " Big as dogs ? " " Bigger . " Father pointed with his finger stump and said , " That 's north , Mr. Haddy . " " I could have told you . I know north like I know me own name . " " Right now , " Father said dreamily , " someone over there in America is painting yellow lines on a road , and someone else is wrapping half an onion in a blister of supermarket cellophane , or putting an electric squeezer down the garbage disposal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened a can of chocolate-flavored soup in a beautiful kitchen , because he ca n't get his car started , to eat out . He really wanted a cheeseburger . Someone just poisoned himself with a sausage of red nitrate , and he 's smiling because it tasted so good . And they 're all cursing the president . They want him re-tooled . " Father was silent a moment . Mr. Haddy said , " That sure is north . " " There , " Father said , facing the darkness , " there 's an interior decorator , probably a funny-bunny , standing in the lobby of a bank . He 's been hired to redecorate it . The bank is failing . It needs depositors . Maybe a new lobby will help . But the decorator does n't know what color to paint it , or where to put the geraniums . He says to the banker , What do you want this room to say ? ' " " Not too sure about that , " Mr. Haddy said . " Someone 's thinking up a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someone else just died of them . " " That ai n't good , " Mr. Haddy said . " But we 're going home , " Father said . " Ever I tell you bout the tiger and my ma and the yampi ? " " Tell me , Mr. Haddy . But give me that wheel first . " Mr. Haddy said , " I will never give you this wheel . I am the captain , I am the steerer , this me own lanch . " Father was silent . He sometimes gave off a smell when he wasangry , and I had a whiff of that now , a little glow of tomcat stearr . " You 's a passenger . " But Mr. Haddy 's voice had lost its boldness . " If I was the passenger type , I 'd be over there , " Father said . Hepointed north , toward the United States . " Go to bed , Charlie . "  |p123I  unrolled my sleeping bag near Mother and crawled in . The enginevibrated against my back . The mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million tiny star smelts drifting dead on the sky tide . It was darker when I woke than it had been when I turned in . There was a close clammy blackness around the puttering launch , and no stars . The bundle of sleeping bags nearby told me that Jerry and the twins were still asleep . A small light burned in the wheel house . Father was steering . Mother was beside him with a map , and Mr. Haddy was nowhere to be seen . With his hands on the wheel , and the lantern light distorting his face , Father looked eager and impatient . I asked him where Mr. Haddy was . " Threw him overboard , " Father said . " He could n't take the strain . " How much did I trust Father ? Completely . I believed everything he said . I even looked off the stern , at our foaming wake , expecting to see the teeth in Mr. Haddy 's drowning face . Mother said , " He 's kidding you , Charlie . Mr. Haddy 's asleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Gaw , I wish we had one of these boats . " He had a dead cigar in his mouth , and he worked the wheel with spread fingers , his firelit face against the wheel-house window . Behind him , Mother held lightly to his shoulder , her white hand keeping him back , the way she had restrained Jerry and the twins at the rail of the Unicorn . Her face was pale , enclosed by smooth straight hair and without any expression . Her dark eyes mirrored the darkness ahead and seemed to absorb the lantern flame . She was calm , but Father was hunched forward as if straining to break free of her grasp . He had shadows of muscle knots in his jaw , and his face twisted to make sense of the darkness . His eyes shone with certainty , like glints of shellac . He was active and watchful . He did not turn his eyes  --  he turned his whole head when he wanted to see aside . Father and Mother remained in this posture , not speaking , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they seemed like a wild man and an angel , and this boat an example of the kind of life we led , plowing through dark water with black jungle on one side and deep sea on the other , and moonless night above us.  |p124But  I did not see the jungle until later , after Mr. Haddy woke and told me we were passing the " haulover " at the Guayamoreto Lagoon , just past Trujillo . Then the darkness , which was like fathoms of ink , softened , becamefinely gray , and , without revealing anything more of the sea , turned to powder . All around us the powdery dawn thickened , until , growing coarser and ashy , in a sunrise without sun , it threw us glimpses of the soapy sea and the shoreline and the jungle heaped like black rags of kelp . Soon the sun was an hour high on the naked level shore . " Fadder steering me lanch , " Mr. Haddy said in amazement . But he was the only one on board who was surprised that Father had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I complain it breaking regulations , but it ai n't do a dum bit of good . " I think we were all secretly glad of this , and the fact that Father was steering another man 's boat through an unfamiliar sea to a foreigncoast was proof that he could do anything . " Oh , Lord , " Mr. Haddy said , as a lightning bolt was printed briefly on the mist . Bearded clouds flushed with light , then faded . There was a dead pause , then a thunderclap , the nearest thing I had heard to a bomb , and soon the sea around us was pricked by raindropsas big as marbles . Dawn streaks and storm clouds met in this wide sky above the tropical sea , the sun pushing the slanting storm to the shore . The rain did not fall evenly . We made our way in the launch east along the coast through these bowed contours of driving rain  --  now beating on Father 's ironware and the whole deck awash , now silent and all the wet boards blackened . Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it had been when we left La Ceiba . The clouds parted  --  a whole sky of them above the flat sea , moving aside and changing in shape , columns of them , and roofbeams , collapsing and shouldering their way to the shore . The sun broke through and dazzled us . It was fire-bright and very hot , the lower rim of its saucer still dipped in the dishwater cloud , and when it burst upon us it brought steam and stinks from every plank of the sodden launch . " We be in Santa Rosa for breakfast , " Mr. Haddy said . " She ai n't far  --  maybe half an hour . You can almost see her . " " I 've got news for you , sir , " Father said . " We 're going to have breakfast right here . Look what Mother and I caught , while the rest of you were dead to the world  --  "  |p125He  leaned back and drew a line of striped fish out of a basket . Mr. Haddy called them sheepshead fish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now you gut those fish , Mr. Haddy , and Mother will start the cookstove . The kids will clear the deck and we 'll have us some real food . Or would you rather put into Santa Rosa and eat last month 's beans ? " Mr. Haddy took the fish and started slitting them . Up ahead , Jerry and the twins had crawled nut of their sleeping bags and were rubbing their eyes . Mother set out a basin of fresh water , so we could wash , and then she fired up the cookstove ( this was a steel barrel , cut in half , with a grid over the top ) , and she put the coffee on . " I 'll tell you another thing , " Father said . " We 're not stopping at Santa Rosa . " Mr. Haddy was opening the sheepsheads like envelopes and pinching out tube clusters of gray guts . With some of this slimy spaghettion his fingers he said , " First you say you ai n't want to go to Trujillo , because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make me into a fishmonger and say we ai n't gung to Santa Rosa . Nothing wrong with Santa Rosa , for hell sake . " Father said , " I 've been looking at the map . " " Fadder and his map , " Mr. Haddy said . He scraped the fish as if he were punishing them and punishing his thumb , and sent the tarnishedsilver scales flying across the deck . " I did n't say we 're not going there , " Father said . " I said we 're not stopping . " We ate the fish under the foredeck awning because of the occasionalsqualls . Mr. Haddy cut a fishhead open , and in its brain was a fragment of a clear substance , like glass , a knuckle of it . Father decided to wear it around his neck . " Like a Zambu feller , " Mr. Haddy said , and then he told us to look up . There , under long chutes of rain , were a jetty and some yellow buildings and the green stripe of jungle shore . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was , Father said , a dark insult on the green Mosquito Coast , no more than ten low buildings and a church steeple . Steam and smoke , red-tiled roofs , and half a dozen kids on a jetty . " We stop at Rosy ? " Mr. Haddy said . Father said , " I never stop until I get where I 'm going . " " If I am steering this lanch , I land back there , Fadder , " Mr. Haddy said . He looked at me sadly . The whites of his red-rimmedp126eyes were stained with brown blotches . We had passed the jetty and the beach . Mother told him not to worry . He said he was not worried , but he was pretty confused . " Keep your shirt on , " Father shouted from the wheel house . The twins were at the bow . " You can see the bottom , " April said . And Jerry hurried forward for a look . " I ai n't even know why I ai n't steering , " Mr. Haddy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfy water  --  that is the rivermouth . Now what the man doing ? " There was a break in the shore , and at this wide opening a river current met the rising tide . The surf rushed sideways spilling silt onto sandbars . Further on I could see sticks and branches beating down toward the sea . Father swung the launch onto this brown inland tide . A fishermanstanding knee-deep in green breakers cast his net over the water and waved to us . Little Haddy nosed into the current , sending up spouts on either side of the bow . " This ai n't the way , Fadder ! " Mr. Haddy cried . He was still seated , frowning near the leavings of our breakfast , the fish bones and bread crusts and coffee cups . " Him no yerry , " he mumbled . " Him no keer . " He got to his feet and went to the wheel house to complain . " Please , Mister . This ai n't no cayuka . This is a lanch ! " " Sit down , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Haddy said . " I ai n't steer up these rivers . " " That 's no ordinary river  --  that 's a flood , " Father said . " It 's funny . First time I saw Santa Rosa on the map I did n't notice the river , and when I did notice it , it looked small . It was the rain that gave me the idea . She 's in flood . There 's enough water in this river to take us most of the way to Jeronimo . " " It ai n't for lanches ! We get broke on a rock-stone ! " " He does n't trust me , " Father said . " If you do n't lose me license , you lose me lanch . Oh , my hat ! " The launch had started bucking in the current , throwing the awningfrom side to side . The old iron clanked and rubbed . " Allie ! " Mother cried , as she was soaked by a shower of spray . Now the boat seemed light , and it tipped easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fearing that it would go over . " I ca n't do this alone , " Father said . " I need your help , Mr. Haddy . Now hop up there to the bow and if you see any rocks , youp127give me a shout . We 're fighting the current , so there 's no sense cuttingthe engine down . Now what do you say "  --  more spray hit the wheel-house window  --  " are you on my team or not ? " " Another spearmint , " Mr. Haddy said . He was not smiling . " Ai n't like these rivers . Fellers up there in that jungle  --  black fellers  --  they got tails ! " It was the Aguan River , Father said , and on the Santa Rosa bank people had started to gather , maybe thinking that we were going ashore . They carried baskets of fruit , bunches of coconuts , and straw mats . When they saw us heading into the middle of the stream and moving against the floating branches and the debris of broken cane stalks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tottering dogs yapped at us , too . We traveled on , past the settlement that lay behind Santa Rosa , the sloping shacks and the huts on stilts and the rows of overturned canoes on the riverbank . We passed the gatelike entrance of a green lagoon , and pushed on , struggling in the river that brimmed at our bow . It was hotter here , for the sun was above the palms and the storm clouds had vanished inland . There were no mountains , or even hills . There was nothing but the riverbank of palms and low bushes and yellow-bark trees , and the sky came down to the treetops . The high muddy river had flooded the bushes on the bank . Mr. Haddy hung over the bow with a sounding chain . He was singing sorrowfully and showing us the seat of his pants . From time to time , he called out " Rock-stone to port ! " or " Rock-stone dead ahead ! " The ocean was astern , and then we turned on a riverbend and it was lost to view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt and the fish smells . We were enclosed by jungle on the short reaches of the river , and each tree shrieked with birds and insects . They were loud , like the sound in your ears when you eat potato chips . The launch took on a different character . At sea it had seemed dilapidated and very small . But here , furrowing up this narrow river , it seemed large and powerful , its engine booming against the banks , startling the herons and chasing the butterflies aside . " Look at the road hog , " Father said , as Mr. Haddy jangled the chain at a man in a canoe . Mr. Haddy was pointing out birds to Jerry and the twins and catcalling to women who paused in their clothes-scrubbing on the gravelly parts of the bank to watch Its pass . " They never see a lanch here before , " Mr. Haddy said . Mother said , " How far are we going ? "  | " Until we hit bottom , " Father said . We managed fifteen miles or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouting about rock-stones all around . He did n't give signals , he just howled . The water was not so muddy here  --  I could see eels and schools of tiny fish on the gravel bottom . In places there was barely enough room between the banks for the launch 's width to squeeze through , and the rapid water slowed us and splashed onto the deck . It was on one of these narrow twisting canals that I saw the men in the trees . I took them for rooty stumps , strange boulders  --  anything but men . Their heads were propped on branches , and some were squatting under bushes , black shiny-skinned men . Some knelt , facing away from us . We were so close to them I could not tell Fatherwithout their hearing me . Some held sticks and spears and fishnets , but they were silent and did not threaten us . I went to the bow , where Mr. Haddy was hanging over . He saw them , too  --  he was staring into the trees . Then an old black man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water to the bank carrying a bucket . " How is it ? " Mr. Haddy said . He was speaking to the man . The man dropped his bucket against the mud bank , spilling its contents of fish . " Zambu , " Mr. Haddy said . " Ai n't have no tail . " But saying so , he had taken his eyes from the river and let the sounding chain go slack . There was a bump under us  --  the launch was thumped from beneath and the twins were thrown to the deck . Jerry said , " I bit my tongue ! " The launch turned aside , thrust away by the current , and tilted , tipping over the cookstove . We were stuck fast . At once the engine stalled , and the flotsam of river branches piled up against the hull . Father kicked the smoldering cookstove into the river and it sank in its own steam . " End of the line , Mr. Haddy , " he said . " Ask that gentleman where we are . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering the fish and called back to Father , " This here is Fish Bucket ! " Then as the river scarfed around us , seven or eight men appeared on the bank , all black , with big heads and wearing shorts and carry/ing nets and sticks . Father jumped from the stern with a line . He was waist-deep in water and scrambling to the bank . The men watched him securing Little Haddy to a tree . They stepped back a little , as if to give him room , although they were thirty feet away . Father spoke to them in Spanish , in a friendly voice . They stared . They seemed to understand , but they did not reply . " How is it ? " Mr. Haddy cried from the bow . " Right here , " one of the men said . Father said , " They speak English ? " He began to laugh . This pleased the black men . They opened their mouths to watch him laugh . " Good morning , Fadder . My name is Francis Lungley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey , I 've been looking all over for you ! "  |p130JERONIMO  , just a name , was the muddy end of the muddy path . Becauseit had once been a clearing and was now overgrown , it was thicker with bushes and weeds than any jungle . In other ways it was no different from fifty bushy places we had passed on our walk from the Zambu riverbank that Mr. Haddy called Fish Bucket . It was hot , damp , smelly , full of bugs , and its leaves were limp and dark green , " like old dollar bills , " Father said . Jeronimo reminded me of one time when we were in Massachusetts , and fishing . Father pointed to a small black stump and said , " That 's the state line there . " I looked at this rotten stump  --  the state line ! Jeronimo was like that . We had to be told what it was . We would not have taken it for a town . It had a huge tree , a trunk-pillar propping up a blimp of leafy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guanacaste , and under it was a half-acre of shade . The remnants of Weerwilly 's shack and his failure were still there , looking sad and accidental . But these leftover ruins only made Jeronimo seem wilder this wet afternoon . One other thing was a smoking chair in the grass , an armchair , sitting there smoldering . Its stuffings were charred and some of its springs showed and its stink floated into the bushes . This burned chair , useless and fuming , was as unimportant as the place itself , and the only person who was surewe had arrived at our destination was Father . The twins sat down and bellyached . Jerry 's face was red from the steamy heat . Jerry said , " I 'll bet he makes you climb that tree , Charlie . I 'll bet you chicken out . "  |p131But  Father had walked into the chest-high bushes . His baseball cap was turned sideways and he was shouting . " Nothing  --  nothing ! This is what I dreamed about  --  nothing ! Look , Mother  --  " Mother said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing . " " Do you see it , Charlie ? " I said no . He was still punching his way through the bushes . " I see a house here , " he said . " Kind of a barn there , with a workshop  --  a real blacksmith 's shop , with a forge . Over there , the outhouseand plant . Slash and burn the whole area and we 've got four or five acres of good growing land . We 'll put our water tank on that rise and we 'll divert part of the stream so we get some water into those fields . We 'll have to lose some of these trees , but there 's plenty more , and anyway we 'll need timber for a bridge . I figure the house should face east  --  that will give us those hills and the morning sun . I see a mooring down there and a slipway to a boathouse . A couple of breezeways to the left and right of the main house will make us showerproof . The ground 's plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on the safe side and use the underneath for a kitchen . I 'd like to see some drainage back there  --  I smell a swamp . But that 'll be easy . Some three-foot culverts will do the trick , and once we 've got control of the water we can grow rice and do some serious hydraulics . The hard part is the plant . I see it in that hollow , a little downwind . We can take advantage of that fuel growing there  --  they look like hardwoods . It 'll be a cinch to get it off the slope  --  " All this time , under the guanacaste tree , the Zambus and Mr. Haddy were putting their loads down . Mr. Haddy pulled his shoes off and frowned at Father 's voice . Father went on talking , staking out the house , marking his proposed paths , and dividing the land into beanfields and culverts . We had arrived ten minutes before . But even Father 's booming voice could not make Jeronimo mean more than sour-smelling bushes in an overgrown clearing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills behind it , and a stream running through it . The Zambus called the hills mountains  --  the Esperanzas  --  and the stream a river  --  the Bonito  --  and Jeronimo , to their bloodshot eyes , was a farm  --  the estancia . These grand names were all wrong and imaginary , but they were like the names of the Zambus themselves . The half-naked jabBeringman , pointing to the narrow creek and calling it the Bonitop132River , called himself John Dixon . It was the fierce woolly-headed one in the torn short  --  Francis Lungley  --  who told us the name of the mountains , and the dumbest one , Bucky Smart , who called the rusty hut the estancia . They could call it anything they liked , but I knew that Jeronimo was no more than a tin-roofed hut in a bush patch , a field of fingerbananasthat had collapsed with beards of brown smut disease . Over here a broken rowboat and over there some cut-down tree trunks that no one had bothered to saw into cords . What fenceposts there were had turned into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a pigpen , alongside the mud and fever grass and that armchair smoking poison . Father came back saying , " It 's beautiful . " Just then , a scabby black pig hoofed and humped through the grass and ran past us . The Zambu Bucky stood up and made an ugly face at it , as if he were going to murder it with his front teeth . He followed it with his face , then shrugged and squatted on his ankles . He must have been tired  --  he had carried first Clover , then April , all the way from Fish Bucket . " That there is a white-lipped peccary , " Mr. Haddy said . " Worry , " Francis Lungley said . " I 'm not worried , " Clover said . " That is what these boys call them  --  worries . It is a name . One here means maybe fifty or a hundred more in the woods . " " Weerwilly must have lived in that shack , " Father said . " What a hole . I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , " Mr. Haddy said , looking his froggiest as he turned to Father , " there is some folks already inside , so they save you the trouble . " Football faces in the window of the rusty hut stared white-eyed at us through vines of climbing flowers . " Morning-glories , " Father said , and ran to the hut . The faces retreated a little as Father picked a bugle blossom and said , " What 's your name ? " " Maywit , " was the trembly answer . " He telling him the name of the flower , " Mr. Haddy said . " That is the flower , Maywit , not the folks . Folks ' name probably Jones . Jones of the jungle . Jones the chicken-man . " Mr. Haddy clawed his scalp . " Wish I was on me lanch . But Fadder went and ripped a hole in her bum . "  |p133Father  was still trying to coax answers out of the hut , but the faces had gone from the window . We pitched our tents under the spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Father directed , to keep the mosquitoes away . Mother sorted our belongings and food bags and hung them on branches , out of a rat 's reach  --  we had already seen two . The knapsacks and tents reminded Father of shopping in Springfield . He got Jerry to tell the story of how American camping equipment was made by slave children in China and Japan . Father interrupted and gave his war-in-America speech , but the Zambus laughed in the wrong places . As we began to eat , Mr. Haddy said , " Here come Jones the chicken-man . " It was the Maywits , carrying plates of fruit  --  limes , bananas , avocados  --  and handfuls of cassava , and a calabash of something they called wabool . These they timidly presented to Father , who distributedthem to us , saying , " This will keep your bowels open ! " He showed Mr. Haddy an avocado and said , " Two bucks at the A and P. Two lemps for one ! " " Butter pear , " Mr. Maywit said nervously . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right here , " Francis Lungley said . " Am naat taakin to you , " Mr. Haddy said . " You , " he said to Mr. Maywit . " How is it ? " But he was too frightened to speak up . Father said , " I want you all to meet our friends and neighbors , the Maywits . " They gaped at us , we gaped at them . This family too was a father , a mother , and four children . But the smallest child was naked and being carried like a knapsack by one of the girls . They were our reflections  --  shrunken shadows of us . The man was short and had brown barklike skin , and the woman was chicken-eyed , and the kids had dirty legs . " That is you actual name  --  Maywit ? " Mr. Haddy said . Father said , " Pay no attention to this interloper . " The man said " Ow " in agreement . Then he blinked flies from his eyelids and said , " We was just going out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huss . " " You 're not going anywhere , " Father said . " You 're staying put . I 've got some work for you to do . "  | " More spearmints , " Mr. Haddy said , and made the Zambus giggle . " You want some work ? " The man said he did n't mind . He made wild eyes at his turned-up toes . " That 's your house . You can have it as long as you make yourselvesuseful , " Father said . " I 've got a house of my own over there , beyond the culverts and the breezeways , just above the mooring and to the left of the barn , where it meets those beanfields . " Ai n't see no huss , someone said softly . The Zambus and the Maywits and Mr. Haddy flicked the bushes with their eyes , searchingfor the things Father had named . There were no culverts , no breezeways . There was no barn , there was no house or beanfields . Then they looked at his finger . " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " do n't mean it ai n't there , " and had a fit of laughing . Father was still smiling at those same bushes when Clover said , " Dad , there 's some ants trying to get into my tent . " " Ants all over this place , " Mr. Haddy said . " Tigers , too . Some of these baboons bigger than a grown-up man . And I step on monkeyshooon the path . " " Them is wee-wees . " This was the chicken-eyed woman , Mrs. Maywit . " Yep , them 's wee-wees . " Mr. Maywit pinched an ant in his fingers and flicked it away . He did not do this disgustedly , but gently and with a kind of sorrow . " You listen to these people , " Mr. Haddy said . " They know what they talking . They lives here . Axe me anything bout the coast , but do n't axe me jungles . " And this was true . Mr. Haddy was a coastal big shot , his voice snickered and mocked in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They carries leafs , " Mr. Maywit said . " But they ai n't hot you . " Father said , " Tomorrow I 'll make a platform for those tents , and some insect traps . I do n't want ants and spiders crawling all over my kids . " Mr. Maywit said , " You from Nicaragua , Fadder ? " " He ai n't from no Nicaragua , " Mr. Haddy said . " What make you say that ? "  | " They got some trouble there . Last people come through . Had some ruckboos . They was from Nicaragua . " He spoke in a slow puzzled way , as if he had just been woken up and was struggling to be interested in his own words . " We 're from the United States , " Father said . Mrs. Maywit sighed in appreciation , and Mr. Maywit said , " That is another place , for true . " Father plumped his hand on the spongy ground . " But this is our home now , " he said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head . No , he did not think so . The air around us was soupy green , like the water in a fish tank , and green shadows rose as the sun dropped . Mother said , " Do many people come through here , like those people from Nicaragua ? " " Some preachers , Ma , " Mrs. Maywit said , staring at Mother with her chicken eyes . " Churcha God . Jove as Wetness . Shouters . " " And Dunkers , " Mr. Maywit said . " And Dunkers . " " If we get any of them , " Father said , " I 'll show them the door . When we get a door ! " " Never mind , " Mr. Maywit said . The sun was now behind the hills , and though the sky was still lighted , green shadows had crept up to our tree . Jeronimo had more substance in the dark . It had sounds  --  insect crackle , bird grunts , the river 's watery mutter  --  and these sounds gave it size , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Jeronimo bird blew softly in a tree . Father gave a little speech in the filling darkness . " We came here in three jumps , " he said . He told them how we had left home in a hurry and gone to Baltimore , then La Ceiba , then on the Little Haddy . He made it sound adventurous , but it had seemed accidental at the time , and not much fun . " What were we looking for ? I 'll tell you , " he said . " We were looking for you . " He named everyone present , even the silent Zambus who had carried the seed bags and metal pipes from Fish Bucket . Somehow , he knew their full names . What was remarkable to me was that he had not slept for two days . He had loaded Little Haddy and done seventy-five pushups on the pier and steered along the coast and up the river and then led us all in single file along the path to Jeronimo.  |p136He  was strangely energetic and talkative when he had gone without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nodding off . But Fatherwalked up and down in the green firelight and whacked the smoky air and said that he was happy , and had plans , and was glad there were so many people here to witness this historic moment . He said he did not believe in accidents . " I was looking for you , " he said . " And what were you doing ? You were waiting for me ! If you had n't been waiting , you would have been some other place . But you were here when I came . I need you good people , and I 've got the feeling that you need me . " Everyone agreed that this was so . Francis Lungley said , " I go down to that river . I ai n't know why . I just have to go . Then I see that old lanch fetch over . " " That is why I looks out the window , " Mr. Maywit said , in the same mystified voice . " I ai n't know why . I sees this man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is why . " Mr. Haddy said , " I have a dream . Bout a man . And this is the man , wearing the same cloves as the man in the dream and a peaky hat . I meet him in my dream . " But I knew that what Mr. Haddy said was a fib . He had told me himself that he had met Father on La Ceiba pier and thought he was a missionary from the Moravian Church . I did not contradict him now , because the mood around this Jeronimo campfire had become solemn . " I was sent here , " Father said . " I 'm not going to tell you who sent me , or why . And I 'm not going to tell you who I am or what I aim to do . That 's just talk . I 'm going to show you why I 'm here . You go ahead and watch . And if you do n't like what you see , you can kill me . " Tiredness had made his voice harsh . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , then let it sink in . There were murmurs . Mr. Haddy scratched his big toe and said he would not dare do such a thing as kill Father , though he was sure hoping to get his launch fixed pretty soon . Father resumed , saying , " I did n't come here to boss you around . I came here to work for you . If I 'm not working hard enough , you just tell me , and I 'll work harder . You come up to me and say , Mister , you 've got to do a whole lot better than this . ' I 'm working for youp137people , and you 're going to see things you 've never seen before . What do you want me to do first ? It 's up to you . " No one spoke . " You want some food ? " Father said . " You want a bridge and some beans and a paddle pump and a chicken run ? " Mr. Maywit cleared his throat . " I heard you , " Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the hills are going to look down here and they 're not going to believe their eyes . They 're going to be absolutely feverish with amazement . " Every listener was transfixed . The only sounds were from the jungle , and here and there a smack when mosquitoes were slapped . Beyondour tents and our little fire , the jungle was black . The blacknessscreeched , it grunted  --  it had risen up and wrapped us in its noise and in its sweet-sour folds . The hidden insects were excited and the darkened trees made a sound like brooms . " Now let 's get to bed , " Father said , " before we all get bitten alive . " But he remained by the fire . " Ai n't you sleeping ? " Mr. Haddy said . Father said , " I never sleep ! " The next day we planted the miracle beans . Father made a ceremonyof it . He lined up the men and had them dig with homemade shovels planks that Father had planed into blades . Mr. Haddy did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer  --  I am a sailor . " And Father said , " He does n't want to get his prehensile fingers dirty . " The men stood shoulder-to-shoulder , stabbing the dirt . It was not difficult . The German Weerwilly had had a garden here  --  most of his beanpoleswere still standing . By mid-afternoon we had turned over an acre of weeds . Father dragged out his bean seeds . They were called miracle beans , he said , because they were a forty-day variety . The first ones he planted he gave names . " This is Captain Haddy , " he said , and held up a bean . " This is Francis , " and he held up another one . Then he poked them into the holes . " This one is Mr. Maywit . This is Charlie . This is Jerry  --  "  |p138He  straddled the furrows and when he ran out of names , he planted faster . Half the field was miracle beans , the rest was Wonder Corn and tomatoes and peppers  --  the seeds we had bought in Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he had been expecting it . That was part of the ceremony , too , he said . Mother said to him , when we were alone that night , " Are n't you laying it on a little thick , Allie ? " But Father just laughed and said that it had been his intention to get us out of the States and save us . He had not thought that he would be saving other people as well . Yet that was what had happened . If we had not come here , these people would have been bone-idle , and the vultures would have made a meal of them . " I want to give people a chance to use their know-how , " Father said . The following day , he asked Mr. Maywit what his occupation was . " I been a sexton in my time . Up in Limon , " Mr. Maywit said . And he explained . " Polish the brosses , make em shine . Set out vesmins . Hang the numbers on the board . Tidy out the pews . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some barbering . " " Hair cutting ? " " Cutting and dressing . And ironing hair . And twisting . Heating it flat . And I know how to wax  --  flows . " Small night rats , called pacas , gnawed through the corners of the nylon tents . We ate the pacas . They were good-tasting , and Father said it was poetic justice . We made a wooden platform for the tents to keep their floors dry and hold the tents straight  --  the stakes had not held in the wet ground . Down at the river we made a trap that funneled fish into a wire cage , and from a simple roof and frame and some of the mosquito netting we built a mosquito-proof gazebo where we could congregate . These were gadgets , not inventions , but they made life more comfortable , and within very few days I could see the skeleton of a settlement in Jeronimo . Every evening , the Zambus turned their backs on us and crept into the jungle . Every morning , looking wrinkled and damp , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Toward the end of the first week , Mr. Haddy left Jeronimo with some of the Zambus . Mr. Haddy did not come back immediately , but the Zambus did ,  |p139towing  log rafts on harnesses Father had made for them . On these rafts were the last of our supplies from Little Haddy . The boilers , the tanks , and the rest of the scrap metal were dragged away and stacked . Some of the pipes Father used for his first real invention at Jeronimo  --  a simple paddle wheel that moved a belt of coconut cups up a tower on the riverbank and filled a drum with water . The height of the drum gave it enough force to pipe the water anywhere we liked , but most of it went to an enclosed shed that became known as the bathhouse . We washed clothes there , and took showers , and boiled water for drinking , and altogetherit improved our lives . The excess water flowed through a stone culvert and under the bathhouse to a privy at the edge of the clearing , where our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Maywits ' latrine was mucky and so fly-blown that Father said , " Anyone who uses that throne is Lord of the Flies . " The first invention , a pump made on the spot , was a piece of primitive technology . The Maywits and Zambus were greatly impressed by its flapping and splashing , but they said they could not understand why Father had made such a thing in the rainy season , when there was water everywhere . " We 're building for the future , the dry season , " Father said . He said it was a civilized thing to do . " And know why it 's a perfect in-vention ? " " Cause you ai n't have to walk down there with a bucket , " Mr. Maywit said . " That 's blindingly obvious , " Father said . " No , it 's perfect because it 's self-propelled , uses available energy , and it 's nonpolluting . Make one of these up in Massachusetts and they 'd have you certified . But they 're not interested in perfection . " Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose and the paddlewheel was torn off its brackets and rods . Father strengthened it with metal straps and it continued to supply us with water and went onsluicing the latrine . Each time he made something , Father said , " This is why I 'm here . " It was Father 's policy that no one should be idle . " If you see me sit down , you can do the same , " he said . But he even ate standing up . Part of the beanfield was divided into plots  --  one plot for eachp140kid , who had to keep his portion weeded . There were other tasks assigned to us , such as collecting firewood and keeping the fish trap mucked out . And when our chores were done we were to gather stones the size of hen 's eggs and use them for paving the paths . So there was always something to do , which was perhaps just as well because it took our minds off the heat and the insects . And the uncertainty , too , for though Father said confidently , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know why we were , and were too scared to ask . The work in the first few weeks was mostly land clearing . The process of clearing the land of bushes and small trees revealed more of Weerwilly 's activities and uncovered some of the implements he had abandoned . We found a plow and bales of chicken wire and any number of small tools , a lantern that worked pretty well , and an oil drum with enough fuel in it to last us for months . These discoveries filled Father with enthusiasm and convinced him that Weerwilly had failed because he was careless , like the people in America who junked perfectly good lumber and wire . And he said that if the Maywits had been a little sharper , they would have found this stuff and used it themselves to improve the place , instead of playing Lord of the Flies . One day , following some of the Zambus who were clearing land , I came upon a bird jerking in a clump of grass . But it was not the grass that held it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web , like a hank of wool . I knelt down and untangled it , and I had let it go before I thought to look for the spider . Then I saw it  --  as big as my hand , and brown and hairy , and matching the color of the fever-grass roots . The Zambu Bucky said it was a Hanancy spider and not only did she catch birds but she ate them as well , and she would eat me too if I was not careful . The bird , a peachy-gray color , was one that Bucky said just came a few weeks in the year . I guessed it was a migratorybird , too innocent to be wary of the spiders in the jungle grass . It worried me to think that we were a little like that bird . There was everything in this grass  --  scorpions , snakes , wire , chicken bones , mice , pacas , wine bottles , ant nests , and shovelheads . We cut the grass so that mosquitoes would not have a place to breed , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , while the clearing went on ( it was supervised by Mother , who was infected by Father 's desire to shave the whole of Jeronimo and rid us of bugs ) , Mr. Maywit and Father were digging postholes for ourp141new house . Father kept saying that what they needed was a posthole digger . Later that day , Francis Lungley clanked his machete against a metal object . He brought this thing to Father , who said it was the business end of a posthole digger . He worked its blades , which were like jaws , and said , " All she needs is a couple of handles and we 're on our way . " It took him less than an hour to get it working . " I needed a posthole digger , and a posthole digger was found . Now I ask you was this accident or was this part of some granddesign ? " The best find in all the land-clearing was a stack of wood , cut into planks . Father said it was the best grade of mahogany  --  so good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it into a piano . It was too heavy for the house , but he said he knew just what to do with it . It was put aside , and the snakes swept out of it , and it was left to dry . " Find me some more of that lumber over there , " he said , and that same day some more wood was found . The Zambus laughed , because  it was right where Father said it would be . Mother worked alongside the Zambus , wearing one of Father 's shirts , with her hair done up in a scarf . This was Father 's idea  --  he said that none of the Zambus would stop working while a woman was on her feet cutting brush . Soon , most of Jeronimo was slashed and burned . It looked as though a battle had been fought there black land , black stumps , steam and smoke issuing from cracks in the earth . Mr. Maywit 's rusty hut stood hanging with morning-glories on an island of its own banana trees . What was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticking about six feet out of the ground . Once the floor was set on these posts , the cooking apparatus was moved to it from the guanacaste tree . This underfloor part of the house became our kitchen . Some corrugated iron sheets were uncovered in the land-clearing . But Father did not like the look of them , and for a number of days he went upriver with three of the Zambus to cut bamboo . He left early in the morning , and an hour or so later the bamboo in eightfootlengths would appear , floating down the river into Jeronimo . These were brought ashore by the other Zambus , the Maywits , and Mother . But most of the carrying was done by the river , Father said . He had a genius for simplifying any job . These bamboos , about five inches thick , were carefully split inp142half and smoothed inside to resemble gutters . By laying them over the roof beams and fitting them like tiles  --  locking them together lengthwise and cupping the line of grooves with an overlapping series laid face-down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so pleased by this , he sang . Under the barn ! Under the boo ! He made the walls in the same way  --  we had four rooms and a porch , which Father called the Gallery . The whole thing had overhangingroof eaves , like an enormous birdhouse . Father was so taken up with the house and the work projects in Jeronimo that our lessons stopped . Mother said they were neglecting us . They ought to be spending some time with the kids , she said . What happened to our education ? " This is the very education they need , " Father said . " Everyone in America should be getting it . When America is devastated and laid to waste , these are the skills that will save these kids . Not writing poetry , or fingerpainting , or what 's the capital of Texas  --  but survival , rebuilding a civilization from the smoking ruins . " It was his old speech , War in America , but now he felt he had a remedy . The Maywits and Zambus regarded the bamboo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't paint pictures , they do n't weave baskets or carve faces on coconuts or hollow out salad bowls . They do n't sing or do dances or write poems . They ca n't draw a straight line . That 's why I like them . That 's innocence . They 're a little touched with religion , but they 'll get over that . Mother , there 's hope here . " During the house raising , Father encouraged us to watch him with the Maywit children . Clover and April got on well with the Maywit girls  --  though Clover bossed them by making them recite the alphabet over and over again  --  and Jerry played with the boy called Drainy , who was also ten . None was my age , so this left me free to help Father , or play by myself . Drainy was a bug-eyed boy with a shaven head and spaces between his teeth . He had a collection of little cars and toy bikes made out of coathanger wire . As he was playing with Jerry , I found some of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me what they were.  |p143I  showed him . They were ingeniously made . They had moving parts , and one resembled in the smallest detail a tricycle , with pedals and wheels . Father was fascinated by anything mechanical . He sat down and studied them . After he had meditated over them for several minutes and tried them , he said , " These were made by some very sophisticatedinstruments . See how that wire is twisted and joined ? There 's no soldering at all , and the angles and bends are perfectly formed . " He looked at me and winked . " Charlie , " he said , " I think someone 's hiding tools from us . I had these people all wrong . I could use the kind of precision tools that made these . " He showed Mr. Maywit , who said sure enough , they were Drainy 's . Drainy was summoned to the Gallery . " Where did you get these ? " Father asked . " I make um . " " Take your time , son , " Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you made them . I 'll give you some wire . Now you get your tools and make one for me . " Father gave the boy some fine strands of wire , but Drainy did not move . He held them dumbly in his dirty hand , and sucked his teeth . " Do n't you want to show me your tools ? " Mr. Maywit gave the boy a poke in the shoulder . " Ai n't got no tools . " Father said , " So you ca n't make them after all ? " " Kin , " Drainy said . He squatted and took the wire in his teeth , and by chewing it and drawing it through the gaps like dental floss , and champing it like a marrow bone , he formed it into a sprocket and held it up for Father to admire . Mr. Maywit 's excitement made him gabble  --  " He make em wif his teef ! " Father said to Drainy , " You take care of those choppers and brush them every day . I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy life these first weeks in Jeronimo . It was no coconutkingdom of free food and grass huts and sunny days , under the barn , under the boo . Wilderness was ugly and unusable , and where were the dangerous animals ? There was something stubborn about jungle trees , the way they crowded each other and gave us no shade . I saw cruelty in the hanging vines and selfishness in their root systems . This was work , and more work , and a routine that took up every daylight hour . On the Unicorn and in La Ceiba , and even in Hatfield , we had done pretty much what we pleased . Father had left us alone and gone about his own business . Usually I had helped him , but sometimes not . Here , things were different . There was a bell at sunup , by which time Father already had the fire going and the coffee on . The Maywits always joined us  --  they had stopped cooking for themselves the week we arrived in Jeronimo . After pineapple and oatmeal , Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for the day . On Mondays he gave us our targets for the week : finish the house , or get so many bushels of stones , or clear a certain amount of land , or cut beanpoles , or dig trenches for culverts . The Maywits were mainly the gardeners , the Zambus mainly the landclearers and builders , and the children  --  the Maywits and us  --  the collectors and cleaners . We did our jobs throughout the morning , and by lunchtime the heat was terrible  --  it was now July . Lunch was always hot soup , because Father had the idea that it was necessary for us to sweat buckets : it kept us cool , nature 's way . Afternoon work was often interrupted by rain , but the downpours did not last long and we werep145soon back on the job . All work stopped in the late afternoon , for it was then that the black flies and mosquitoes appeared , and their bites were torture . Just before sundown we took turns in the bathhouse , washing up . One of the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never kept so clean , but here Father became a maniac for cleanliness . He made us change our clothes every day , too . Clothes to be washed were dumped in a tub , and one of the smells of Jeronimo was this skunk stew of boiling clothes . Mrs. Maywit had always washed her family 's clothes in the river , but now she used the tin clothes tub . Father was pleased that the Maywits had begun followingour example in taking a daily shower . Only the Zambus remainedthe same they steamed like tomcats , as Father did when he was very angry . In the early days , we spent the dark mosquito hours between supperand bedtime in the insect-proof gazebo . After the house was finished , we sat on the Gallery ( also insect-proof ) until it was time to turn in . The Maywits often joined us . Mr. Maywit told us about the Indians in the mountains and up the rivers . He liked giving information . He said it was true what Mr. Haddy had told us , about some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Indians was all giants , and another pygmies . Mr. Maywit 's strangest story was about some Indians he called Munchies . He said that Munchies lived in a certain part of Mosquitia , and he confessed that he had thought , on first seeing us , that we might be Munchies . The Munchies kept themselves hidden in secret cities in the jungle . They had been here longer than the Miskito Indians , or Payas , or Twahkas , or Zambus . But there was nothing to be afraid of in the Munchies , because they were peaceful and virtuous . They were also very tall , and built pyramids , and were in all respects a noble people . Father said , " You forgot the important part , Mr. Maywit . They 're white Indians . Whiter than me  --  even whiter than you . " The Maywits were the color of instant coffee powder and had burned hair and green eyes . " You see them ? " Mr. Maywit said . " Dad knows everything , " Clover said . " I know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about their gold , Mr. Maywit . " " I ai n't know nothing about no gold . "  | " They 've got gold mines , " Father said . " Nuggets as big as walnuts . They hammer it thin and write on it . They roll it and make bangles . Gold dust and gold slabs  --  ingots a yard wide . " " Haddy tell you this ? " Father said , " Nope . But save your breath , Mr. Maywit . I do n't want to hear about white Indians who are angels . I want to hear about the devils from Nicaragua . " " The ones they carry ruckboos ? " " Not only them , but the ones that make things go wrong , give you headaches and toothaches and flat tires , let the mosquitoes in , and hide things that belong to you , so you never find them again . The ones that make funny noises at night and keep you awake and pull your house down and set you on fire . " " Never hear of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Stands to reason . If there 's golden white Munchies in secret cities , there 's got to be horrible devils that do you wrong , is n't that so ? " Mother said , " Allie 's pulling your leg , Mr. Maywit . He does n't mean a word he says . I think that 's a darned interesting story about the Munchies . " " But he hear it before . " " Tell me something I do n't know , " Father said . " Forget the Munchies and the devils . If you believe in them , you never get anythingdone  --  spend half your life looking over your shoulder . Personally , I do n't believe in Munchies , unless I 'm a Munchy . " He frowned . " Which is entirely within the realm of possibility . " Jerry said he did not believe in Munchies , and April said it was a silly superstition , like the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus and God . Mr. Maywit said that we could think what we wanted , but for true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had seen God with their own eyes at the Shouter church over in Santa Rosa . " What exactly did God look like ? " Father asked . " Like a bill-bird in a cloud , " Mr. Maywit said . " That is what Ma Kennywick say . " " So you did n't see God ? " " No , Ma Kennywick see God , and I see Ma Kennywick . " " Up the Shouters , " the chicken-eyed Mrs. Maywit said . " It was a speerience , " Mr. Maywit said . " I 'm sure , " Father said . " Now tell me something I do n't know . "  | " Know about Duppies ? " I said , " Mr. Haddy knows about them . " " But Mr. Haddy has flown the coop , " Father said . " So let 's give this gentleman the floor . Go on , sir , you 've given us your proof for the existence of God  --  that is , Ma Kennywick 's shouting that the Almighty looks like a bill-bird in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " The Shouters tell me about them , and lots of folks , even Zambu fellers , believe in Duppies . Mainly , Fadder , they is ghosts . " " Of dead people , " Father said . " Of alive people . " " I see . " " Everyone got a Duppy . They is the same as youself . But they is you other self . They got bodies of they own . " " So half the world is people and the other half is Duppies , is that right ? " " Never mind , " Mr. Maywit said . Mrs. Maywit was wringing her fingers . She said , " Cep you cai n't ketchum . " " Invisible ? " Father said . " They is here , " Mr. Maywit said . " Somewhere . Waitin . They shows up every time to time . But they ai n't hot you . Make you shout , Duppies do . That is why Shouters see them . Me , I never see my Duppy . " Father said , " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Maywit did not say another word . He stared at Father and his coffee-dust face became slack with fear . His eyes grew another rim around the sockets . It was as if at last he understood who this man was , and was about to surrender to this belief . " That 's enough , Allie , " Mother said . She spoke to Mr. Maywit . " Ca n't you see he 's joking ? " " Never mind . " But Mr. Maywit 's voice trembled as he said so . Father was interested in what Mr. Maywit had said , but he went on joking about Munchies and Duppies . I was sure he believed some of it it was too good not to believe . Live ghosts ! White Indians ! Andp148I knew from past experience that Father was never more mocking than when he was discussing something serious . If someone was fearful , Father joked . If the person tried to be funny , Father quoted the Bible or said , " Have n't you heard there 's a war coming ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jeronimo he claimed that he could go without sleep . He was awake when we went to bed , and he was at work when we got up in the morning . He also said he could go for days without food , and never got sick , and was n't bitten by mosquitoes . This mystified the Maywits and the Zambus , but I knew he was trying to set an example  --  if he worked hard and did not complain , the others would have to . Work and lack of sleep did not make him irritable . In fact , I had never seen him happier . And Mother , who loved him in this mood , was happy too . Now we had a house and a number of inventions that made life convenient . The Zambus , whom we had met by chance on that Fish Bucket riverbank , seemed contented . They walked around in trunks and short-sleeved shirts that Mother had made for them out of sailcloth . And the Maywits , with Father 's help , improved their own house . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pods that Father said would be ready for picking in a few weeks . The other crops flourished beside the spillways of irrigation ditches . Entering Jeronimo from the Swampmouth path , you saw something that looked like a settlement  --  houses , gardens , stone-paved paths , and the pump wheel flinging water into the drum . It was the civilizedplace Father had seen that first day , when all we had seen was tall grass and a mud bank and a smoldering armchair . I was luckier than anyone . When the twins went down with squittersbecause of stomach trouble , and then Mother and Jerry , I did not get sick . And I noticed that Father liked me a little better for that . He had a way of insinuating that if anyone was sick he was faking , or at least exaggerating . He never said " He 's sick , " but always " He says he 's sick " or " She claims she 's ill. " j " I have n't the time to get sick , " he said . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get sick as a dog ! " One day , Mr. Haddy returned . By then , Father had started buildingwhat he called the Plant , which was so far only a large frameworkof peeled poles two stories high , in the hollow at the back ofp149the cleared land . The boilers were dumped there . We heard the motor before we saw the launch . Father made me climb to the top of the poles to get a look at it . " Who is it ? " he said , sounding angry for the first time in Jeronimo . " It 's the Little Haddy , " I said . I could see the torn awning and the little wheel house . Father was glad about this , but when he got down to the landing he did not like what he saw . Mr. Haddy was not alone . There was a man with him  --  a white man , carrying a suitcase ashore . Mr. Haddy explained that he had pumped out the launch at Fish Bucket , and patched it . He had found that without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to float easily in the shallowest river . After spending two weeks at Santa Rosa getting it properly fixed , he decided to see if he could make it all the way to Jeronimo , by sailing up the Bonito River , where it branched from the Aguan . " I bring you some real food from Rosy  --  carkles and conks and wilks . " These shellfish were in kegs on the deck . Then he showed us a dead turtle . Its flippers had been hacked off , and its lizard head of beaky bone hung out of its big barnacled shell . " And a hicatee . " But Father was not interested . He said , " Who 's this hamburger ? " " This here Mr. Struss from Rosy . " " How do you do , " the man said . He stepped forward onto the mushy bank and set his suitcase down . Then he took his sunglasses off and tried to smile , but his eyes wrinkled shut in the sunlight and gave him a squinched face . He was a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark sweat patch on every bulge of his body  --  moons under his arms , and a belt of wet around his waist . I le turned his suffering smile on us . " What lovely kids . " He looked beyond us . " And you 've made yourself a beautiful home . " " What do you want ? " Father said , blocking the path and keeping the man sinking in mush . The Zambus had put down their tools , and the Maywits had trooped from the garden . There were about seventeen of us here , watching Father and the stranger . " Mr. Haddy said he was coming up this way . He kindly let me hitch a ride . "  |p150Mr  . Haddy said , " He a paying passenger , but I do all the steering . He work the sounding chain . He know the way . " " I 've been here before . Mr. Roper knows me . Do n't you , Mr. Roper . " He was speaking to Mr. Maywit . Father said , " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistaken identity . The heat is making you rave . " Mr. Maywit just goggled and kept his mouth shut . The man was confused . He put his sunglasses on again and picked at the sweat patches on his shirt and said , " I came here to ask you all a question . " " We 're not interested in your questions , " Father said . " You just answered it , brother . And I 'm glad I came . Because the question is , Are you saved ? ' And I 've got a funny feeling , the Lord  --  " " The Lord is up in that tree , " Father said , pointing with his finger stump at a bill-bird on a branch . The man stared at Father 's finger , and even adjusted his sunglassesto get a better look . " Go away , " Father said , and gave the man his deaf-man 's smile . " You ca n't answer for these people here . " " I 'm not answering at all , " Father said . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open your mouth or ask a question . You 're not allowed to . I own this place , and you do n't have my permission to come ashore . If you want to talk to these people , you 'll have to do it somewhere else , outside Jeronimo . About half a mile due north of here you 'll come to a little swamp . That 's Swampmouth , the Jeronimoline . Ca n't miss it . You go there and do all the preaching you like . Start walking , Mr. Struss . " He handed the man his suitcase . " The Lord sent me here , " Mr. Struss said . " Bull , " Father said . " The Lord has n't got the slightest idea that this place exists . If he had , he would have done something about it a long time ago . " " This river does n't belong to you , brother . " " You planning to walk on the water ? " Father said . " If so , do n't say another word until you 're midstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered on his shoulders and he was breathing hard.  | " You know I 'm a fair man , " Father said to us . " If any of you people want to go with him , I wo n't stop you . Hurry on down to Swampmouth and listen to what this gentleman has to offer . Anyoneinterested ? " Mr. Maywit and his chicken-eyed wife looked anxiously at Father . The Zambus had started giggling . " Excuse me , Mr. Roper , will you please  --  " " Shut it , " Father said , and Francis Lungley laughed out loud . Mother said , " You 'd better do as my husband says . There are some dugout canoes at Swampmouth , and I 'll give you a bag lunch . You 'll have no trouble getting back to the coast . " " The Lord wants me here , " Mr. Struss said . Father said , " That 's what I like about you people your completelack of presumption . But listen , I 'm not going to tempt you with martyrdom , so just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little while later , from the porch of the house , we saw Mr. Struss walking down the riverbank toward Swampmouth . He carried his suitcase in one hand and Mother 's lunch bag in the other . He was alone . Father said , " Imagine that hamburger coming all that way to ask a silly question . " He put his face close to Mr. Maywit 's and said , " Are you saved ? " " Yes , Fadder . " He then asked everyone else in turn and they said yes and laughed along with him . He asked me and I said yes , but I was at the window and I saw that , hearing us laugh , Mr. Struss glanced up . He looked sick , but he kept on walking . The days passed . They were sunny , there was little rain , they were muffled by dust . But the nights were furious with the ringing cries of insects , and bird grunts that sometimes rose to screams . The darknesshelped us hear the soft splash of monkeys on branches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if every bush and tree were burning . And night heat was more suffocating than in the day , and made sleep seem like death . It was a dreamless plunge into that riot . Father spent these days hammering . He did not say why , but his eyes told me that his thoughts were storms . And every man in Jeronimo labored with Father at the plant . It was , so far , only a skeleton , with pipes buckled to poles and men hanging like monkeys top152the crosspieces , where they followed Father 's orders . It was slow work , and for a long time it did not look like anything at all . The day after the bean harvest , Father declared a holiday . It was our first day off in six weeks of work . The Zambus shot a curassow and the Maywits brought cooked cassava and plantains and fruit . Father would not allow any of the Maywits ' chickens to be killed . " That 's living on your capital . " We had an afternoon feast in the front yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the Mosquito Coast  --  pirates and cannibals  --  and Clover and April sang " Under the Barn , Under the Boo . " Father gave a speech about us . We were bricks , he said . He went on to explain all the things you could do with bricks . And he got angry only once . This was when Mr. Haddy praised the food . Father hated anyone talking about food  --  cooking it or eating it . Fools did it , he said . It was selfish and indecent to talk about how things tasted . He called this our first thanksgiving . It was now August . Mr. Maywit said he knew this without looking at a calendar , because the sickla bird had arrived . The bird was shiny green and yellow , and very small , with a warbling song that reminded me of the fluting music we had heard the boy play on the beach our first evening in La Ceiba . Work on the plant continued . The mahogany planks were hoisted into position and bolted to the poles . The floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it took on a familiar shape , and before it was finished I guessed what it was.  |p153MOST  OF THEM , including the Maywits ( they had seen one in Trujillo ) , thought that Father had run mad and built a silo . " Shoo ! What green you gung put in it ? " Mr. Haddy said , speaking for everyone . Father said he was not going to put anything into it , and certainly not grain . " But just you wait and see what I pull out of it ! And keep pulling ! Listen "  --  he whispered and stared  --  " this gizmo is sempiternal . It wo n't ever quit . " It was not the bottle that some silos are , nor was it a thermos jug shape , and there were no feed bins . It was tall and square-sided . It had now windows and only one hatchway door , twenty feet up and no stairs to it . It was a plain wooden building , a huge mahogany closet raised up in our clearing in the jungle . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was an oddity of such magnificence that it was a thing in itself , like an Egyptian pyramid . Its great shape was enough . It did not need another purpose . But I knew it was the Worm Tub , enlarged a thousand times . No sooner was it raised than flocks of people came to look . I supposedour hammering was heard in the woods . Father made these strangers welcome . They were hill Indians and Spanish-speaking farmers , and Creoles and Zambus . The Indians did not stay , but the others did  --  Mr. Harkins and Mr. Peaselee , old Mrs. Kennywick ( the very one who had seen God in the Shouter church ) , and some more . They said that they had watched the house  --  as they called it  --  rising . They marveled at it . It was taller than the trees and flat/topped like nothing else around here . They had seen it from far-off . That was an advantage , their curiosity . Just when Father needed help , these people crept out of the trees and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and the first harvest and the rest of the crops coming along fast  --  all we needed  --  everyone in Jeronimo assumed our work was done . This made the plant  --  as Father went on calling it  --  a bewildering surprise . What was it for ? What was it doing here ? Father promised more marvels , but there was still wood to add to the structure proper , and still brickmaking to do . " Where is the bricks , Fadder ? " Mr. Maywit asked . " You 're standing on them . " Father pointed his finger stump at the ground . " Clay ! This is all bricks , just sitting there , waiting to be made ! " There was ironwork , too . " The Iron Age comes to Jeronimo , " Father said . " A month ago , it was the Stone Age  --  digging vegetables with wooden shovels and clobbering rats with flint axes . We 're moving right along . It 'll be 1832 in a few days ! By the way , people , I 'm planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more plumbing in this than a waterworks , but the building went on smoothly . The new people were glad to do the work and liked listening to Father , who talked the whole time . " One of the sicknesses of the twentieth century ? " he said . " I 'll tell you the worst one . People ca n't stand to be alone . Ca n't tolerate it ! So they go to the movies , get drive-in hamburgers , put their home telephone numbers in the crapsheets and say , Please call me up ! ' It 's sick . People hate their own company  --  they cry when they see themselves in mirrors . It scares them , the way their faces look . Maybe that 's a clue to the whole thing  --  " Most of the plumbing was bends  --  enough to make a cow crosseyed . Some of the bends were the fixed elbows we had brought from La Ceiba , and some we made in the forge . The forge was built with the first bricks , and the bellows ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a leather bladder . Father saved his welding torch for finishing off each seal , because he did not want to waste the cylinder of gas . The sight of Father in his welder 's mask , his eyes darting in the mask 's window , with his gauntlets and his asbestos apron and his fizzing torch , fascinated the onlookers . And he kept talking , even with his mask on.  | " Why do things get weaker and worse ? " came the echoey small mask-voice , as if out of a conch . " Why do n't they get better ? Becausewe accept that they fall apart ! But they do n't have to they could last forever . Why do things get more expensive ? Any fool can see that they should get cheaper as technology gets more efficient . It 's despair to accept the senility of obsolescence  --  " They liked his talk , but they loved the spray of sparks and the scabs of dead metal flying . They were astonished to see iron bars soften and drip like tar under the jet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father 's toys . There were others  --  his Thunderbox and Atom-smasher , and even his simpler ones , like the Beaver , which machined and threaded pipes  --  a hand-operated jaw of his own making with a toothy mouth set off by clamps . They were toys to him , but magic to the others . When he took a rusty pipe , reamed it , bent it , gave it threads , and fitted it with so many elbows it looked like a crankshaft , everyone gathered to watch him . Then he was a sorcerer in his iron mask , transforming a hunk of scrap iron into a symmetrical part for the plumbing that was the stomach and intestines of the plant . He claimed that even with this basic equipment , he could make the simplest rod or pipe into the tiniest computer circuit . " I could make microchips out of the thickest iron brick around . I could make dumb metal talk . That 's what computer circuits are  --  words and paragraphs in a primitive language . You do n't think of computers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr. Harkins  --  " but they are . They 're mechanical savages " He said he was making a monster . " I 'm Doctor Frankenstein ! " he howled through his welder 's mask . He called one set of pipes its lungs , and another its poop shaft , and two tanks , " a pair of kidneys . " He always spoke of the plant as " he "  --  " He needs a gizzard today , " or " This will fit straight onto his liver , " or " How 's this for his gullet ? " Harkins and Peaselee laughed at this and asked Father if his monster had a name . Father said , " Tell them , Charlie . " I remembered . " Fat Boy , " I said . Everyone whispered the name . Jerry and the twins were surprised that I knew something they did n't  --  not only its name but its purpose , how it worked , and whatp156it would look like when it was done . They showed me some respect and for a while stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even Mother was a little curious about how I came to know so much . I told her that I had seen the scale model . I remembered the morning Father and I had loaded the little Worm Tub onto the pickup truck and driven past the scarecrow to give Polski a demonstration  --  Father happy , then Father fuming , and the wooden chest gulping and producing a disk of ice in a tumbler . I remembered more than that  --  the rubber seal in Northampton , and the policeman , and Father saying , " No one ever thinks of leaving this country . But I do , every day ! " And the Monkey House . And " It 's a dis-grace . " That was all far away , but seeing this towering windowless buildingat the edge of the clearing , I understood why we had come here  --  to build Fat Boy , to make ice . This was the distant empty place that Father had always spoken about . Here he could make whatever he pleased and not have to explain why to anyone . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Father said , " You look at Jeronimo and you ca n't tell what century it is . This is part of your original planet , with people to match . And you 're wondering why I gave that missionary the bum 's rush ? " Father had found his wilderness . But the people were afraid of Fat Boy . It started with Francis Lungley . He said he heard noises in it at night . Mr. Maywit said it had a smell , not a machine smell but something like tiger breath . " They 's bats inside , " Ma Kennywick said , which was true . " He got twenty-two eyes at night , " Mr. Haddy said , which was not true . They all watched it anxiously , as if it were a dangerous monster . No one would go inside unless Father went first , but Father had a habit of singing inside , and this frightened everyone . Mr. Harkins said one morning that it was gone . We ran out of the house and saw it was there . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zambus still heard noises in it . They were voices . Witches , they said . Father told them to calm down . " This is n't something to be afraid of , " he said . " It is n't new . It is n't even an invention . " But they were still afraid . " It 's a marvel , but it 's not magic . People call me an inventor . I 'm not an inventor . Look , what am I doing here ? "  | " Spearmints , " Mr. Maywit said . He had got the word from Mr. Haddy . " I 'll tell you what I 'm doing  --  what anyone who invents anythingis doing . I 'm magnifying . " Hammering the shoulders of a boiler , talking as he worked , Fathersaid that most invention was either adaptation or magnification . " Take the human body , " he said . That contained all the physics and chemistry we needed to know . The best inventions were based on human anatomy . He himself had two patents on ideas he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Metal Muscle . He said there was no better piece of engineering than the ball-and-socket joint in the human hip . Computer technology was just a clumsy way of making a brain , but the central nervous system was a million times more complicated . " Insulation ? Look at fatty tissue ! " You had to study natural things . Anyone who took a good look at an alligator or a hicatee could make an armored vehicle . The natural world showed man what was possible . In a world without birds there would be no airplanes . " Airplanes are just magnified sparrows  --  they 're crascos with leg room . " The Zambus stared at Father , and the others listened twitchily to this man who the harder he worked the more he talked . " What 's a savage ? " he said . " It 's someone who does n't bother to look around and see that he can change the world . " Everyone looked around and said this was so . Father went on to say that savagery was seeing and not believing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fearful condition . The man who saw a bird and made it into a god , because he could not imagine flying himself , was a savage of the most basic kind . There were tribes of people who did not have the sense to build huts . They went around naked and caught double pneumonia . And yet they lived in the same neighborhood as birds that made nests and jack rabbits that dug holes . So these people were savages of utter worthlessnesswho did not have the imagination to come in out of the rain . " I 'm not saying all inventions are good . But you notice dangerous inventions are always unnatural inventions . You want an example ? I 'll give you the best one I know . Cheese spread that you squirt out of an aerosol can onto your sandwich . That 's about as low as you can go . "  |p158Ma  Kennywick 's laugh went heck-heck , and Mr. Haddy said he had never heard of cheese squirting out of a can . " Like shaving cream , " Father said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer ? It eats it up . And there 's four things wrong with it  --  the processed cheese itself , the squirt , the can , and the sandwich . " He was still hammering the boiler . He said , " I never made anything that did not exist before in a similarform . I just chose something , or part of something , and made it bigger  --  like my valves and my Metal Muscle and my Self-Sealer . I got the idea from human anatomy  --  heart valves , striated muscle , stomach lining . Listen , I made gas tanks punctureproof ! But it was just a question of scale and application , and  --  let 's face it  --  improvement . I mean , doing a slightly better job than God . " Whenever Father mentioned God , the people in Jeronimo glanced at the sky and looked very guilty and ashamed , and squinted as if they expected thunder . Father saw this and changed the subject . " People talk about the invention of the wheel . What 's so wonderfulabout the wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are ball bearings in nature  --  you 've got a rudimentary one in each hip ! The development of lenses ? All optical inventions are plagiarisms  --  of the human eye  --  though I admit the human eye is pretty inferior by comparison . " Mr. Haddy said he had guessed that before . It was all eyes and noses going by different names . And the cranes and derricks on the pier at La Ceiba were the same as arms , except bigger and roustier . " You 're getting the idea , " Father said . " And what 's this ? " He had finished hammering the boiler and was dragging it inside Fat Boy . " That is a spearmint , " Mr. Haddy said . " And you ai n't catch me in there . " " It 's a human 's insides , " Father said . " Its entrails and vitals . Its brisket . Digestive tract . Respiration . Circulatory system . Fatty tissue . And why build it ? Because it 's an imperfect world ! And that 's why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't believe in God  --  stop looking up , people !  --  because if you can make improvements , that does n't say much for God , does it ? " But no one replied , and no one dared to go into Fat Boy alone . Itp159was dark and too cool and full of iron pipes . No windows , the insulationmade it clammy , its darkest corners muttered . " It 's nothing to be scared of , " Father said , looking at me . I knew what was coming . He buzzed a rivet at me . " Charlie 's not scared . Want to see him climb to the top ? " The faces in the clearing flashed at me like clocks . " He wunt get out alive , " Francis Lungley said . " That 's an ignorant remark , " Father said . Clover said , " Dad , why is Charlie shaking like that ? " " Charlie is not shaking . " So I had to obey . I had been working the bellows . I dropped it and wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were saying three-fifteen with their worried squints , and I wondered why . Some were fixed on me , others on Father . If they had not looked so flat and fearful I would have felt better about going into Fat Boy . But they worried my guts . I said , " Oh , rats , " and went in . Father banged the door after me and cut off most of the daylight . All I could see , through the floor joists that had yet to be planked , was the sun shining dustily down between the cracks in the hatchway door . It was like being in a monster body , under the cold lips of its stomach tank . Iron pipes rose sideways around the walls . Greasy with sealer and smelling of fresh welds , they had the egg stink of fart gas and meat turned to mud , and the slippery look of human waterworks . Where the cracks of sun lighted some rusty pipes , I could see how these reddened blisters looked like flesh . The smallest movement of my feet made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A week before , I had scaled the outside with ease . But this was my first time inside , alone , with the door shut , in the dark , making for the top . I gulped my panic and looked up  --  the way up was the way out . I started climbing the pipes , through the midsection , from the tanks Father called kidneys , across the rusty gizzard , to the steel tube he called the gullet . The only sounds that penetrated the walls were Clover 's and April 's yells as they played with the Maywit k ids  --  in the sunshine . There was no fluid in Fat Boy 's pipes . Because of the echo , it was like being in something gigantically dead . The shadows were coolp160twisted pipes that creaked as I climbed . I swung myself to a prickly grid that Drainy Maywit had made with his teeth , and crawled across it , finding my way with my fingers . Just as I said to myself Do n't look down , I looked down . And kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no belly  --  this was Father'shead , the mechanical part of his brain and the complications of his mind , as strong and huge and mysterious . It was all revealed to me , but there was too much of it , like a book page full of secrets , printed too small . Everything fitted so neatly and was so well bolted and finely fixed it looked selfish . I could see that it had order , but the order  --  the size of it  --  frightened me . Like the human body , he had said  --  but this was the darkest part of his body , and in that darknesswere the joints and brackets of his mind , a jungle of crooked iron , and paunchy tanks hanging on thin wires , and soldered-over scars , tubes like vines in monkey shadow , the weight of metal hoses forking to the ceiling , and everywhere the balance of small hinges . It made me dizzy . I could not understand enough of it to feel safe . I thought , You could die here , or  --  trapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the top and pushed it open . Below the hatchway were straw hats . Someone  --  not Father  --  screeched up at me . They set a ladder against Fat Boy and let me down , and they all looked at my face pretty worriedly . " He ai n't bawling anyway , " Francis Lungley said . " You 're next , Fido , " Father said , and hurried Lungley to the door . " In you go ! Take your time  --  get acquainted ! " One by one he sent them in , slammed the door , and made them climb through the pipes to the top hatchway , so they would not be afraid , except Mrs. Maywit , Mrs. Kennywick , and the children . They said they were willing , but Father said , " That 's all that really counts  --  willingness . " He said he was sending the people inside so that they would conquerfear , and I believed him . But I also guessed that he wanted to amaze them with his Yankee ingenuity and give them a glimpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boy . As for me , I did not mention this . I knew what I had seen . And I was glad Father had bullied me into going inside . He was making me a man . Everyone compared the experience with something different . Mr. Maywit said it was like being up the bell tower in the Dunker church . The Zambus said it was like a certain slate cave in thep161Esperanzas , and Mr. Harkins said he had had a dream like it once , but when he tried to explain , his voice cracked and tears came to his eyes . Mr. Haddy said , " Shoo ! It like some of these banana-boat enginerooms . Boiler and narrers . " Hearing all this , Jerry fussed to go in , but Father refused . " I hope you all admired that mesh over the evaporator lungs , " Father said . " That nice piece of work was Drainy 's doing . " Drainy had fixed the mesh with his teeth , making it the way he made his wire toys , with clips and clasps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his molars . " And as you might have noticed , Fat Boy is n't breathing , " Father said . " That 's why I wanted you to see him now , before he 's got some life in him . Then he 'll be dangerous and off limits . He 's going to have work to do , and we do n't want anyone traipsing around his guts then . " The smooth mahogany planks of the enormous icehouse caught the green and gold of the sun in the jungle clearing and glowed like skin . " You wo n't believe what this old boy can do . " Father was proud of it and glad there were people here as witnesses . No one doubted him , or anything he made . He liked leading us around in the morning , from the pump at the river to the bathhouseand through the fields , pointing out how trim everything was , the water gushing and wheels turning and the hybrids shooting up and vegetables heavy on the plants . We walked along paths we had paved , past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first day in Jeronimo was now there for everyone to see  --  food , water , shelter . It was all as he predicted , but more orderly and happier than we had imagined . And on these early-morning inspections , he took Mother by the arm and spoke to everyone by speaking to her . He called this notch in the jungle a superior civilization . " Just the way America might have been , " he said . " But it got rotten and combustible . Greed panicked the worst into doubledipping , and the best fell victim to the system . " The Zambus did n't know what he was talking about , but they liked the way he talked . He could make them laugh by shouting , " Rheostats ! Thermodynamics ! The undistributed middle ! " He said , " I was the last man left . "  |p162But  even when he was not talking for fun , I had to keep my head down or he 'd say , " What are you grinning at , Charlie ? " room for a Toyota dealership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking lots from here to the hills . Facilities ! They 'd be ramming them down our throats . " Mr. Maywit said , " Wish we had a Chinese shop . " " He wants a Chinese shop ! " Father said . Mr. Maywit flinched . " Buy some salt and flour and oil . " " Save your money , " Father said . " You do n't need any Chinese shops . The sea 's full of salt  --  sea salt , the best there is . No additives . Flour will be easy as soon as that corn is ready : we 're going to mill it ourselves . Look at it  --  wonder corn ! I brought that hybrid seed myself , all the way from Massachusetts . It 's three times the size of your Honduras varieties . " " He say oil , " Mr. Harkins said . " I heard him , and my reply is , Peanuts ! ' Next to the spuds , there 's a half acre of goobers . But give them time . Do n't rush them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potatoes and yams were harvested he was going to ban the planting of cassava . It was a lazy man 's crop , he said . Like bananas . True , there was no weeding to be done , but cassava exhaustedthe soil and there was no nutrition in it . Growing it would turn us all into funny-bunniesWork continued on Fat Boy , the fixing and welding of more pipes , the sealing of the tanks , and finishing the firebox and the chimney . Now , no one feared it . In fact , the Zambus preferred to work inside it because it was so much cooler there . It had double walls , and the roof and south side were faced with polished tin sheets that bounced the direct rays of the sun . " If those were solar panels , we 'd be self-sufficient in electricity , " Father said . " But we do n't need electricity or fossil fuels  --  this is a superior civilization . " Yet who would n't grin at some of the things he said ? " We 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " or everyone and his brother will be down here on top of us , all the movers and shakers , opening gas stations and drive-in movies and fast-food joints . Issuing catalogues . Oh , sure , they 'd strap a facility here and another facility over there . Sock a K-Mart next to Fat Boy and get the floating buyers . And you can bet your bottom dollar they 'd findp163We tested it for leaks by filling it with water . There was a fine spray peeing from nine joints , which Father marked and sealed when it was drained . Then Father declared it finished and said that he and Mr. Haddy were going to Trujillo . " Plasma  --  for Fat Boy , " he said . He had arranged for some hydrogenand ammonia to be sent to Trujillo . He had not wanted it shipped all the way to Jeronimo for fear of arousing missionary curiosityand getting more unwelcome visitors , like Mr. Struss or anyoneof the Spellgood persuasion , or Toyota dealers . " Used to shine windows up the Dunker with ammonia water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mrs. Maywit said . " Never mind , " Mr. Maywit said . Mr. Haddy remarked that there was n't a glass windowpane in the whole of Jeronimo , which was true . " You can do anything with ammonia , " Father said . " The ammoniaclock is the most accurate timekeeping device in the world . You do n't believe me ? "  --  Mr. Maywit was frowning " Listen , the tick-tock in it is the oscillation of the nitrogen atom in the ammonia molecule . Francis knows all about it , do n't you ? " Francis said , " For true , Fadder . " " I employ enriched ammonia , " Father said . " What do you think I was doing up there in La Ceiba ? Spitting in the plaza , like all the other gringos ? No , sir . I was juicing up my ammonia . That 's my secret , really . The more enriched it is , the quicker your evaporation . You 'll see . " Mr. Maywit said , " I hear that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Haddy said , while the Zambus stared . " He richen it . That is the way . " " It 's more toxic , " Father said . The Zambus laughed at " toxic . " " But once , it 's sealed into the system , there 's no danger . And it 's everlasting . Take the acids in your stomach . They 're not toxic , but they 're powerful substances . They could burn a pretty big hole in your shirt if they leaked out . And there 's ammonia in nature  --  you know , rotting vegetable matter , seawater , soil , even urine . " Mr. Maywit said he had heard that , too . " You want I come to Trujillo ? I buy some salt and oil for Ma . " Father put his hand on Mr. Maywit 's flour-sack shirt , where it said La Rosa on the shoulder . " I need you here , coach . From nowp164on you 're my field superintendent . You 've got to stay , so you can tell me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Kennywick , the Zambus , Harkins , Peaselee , the Maywits , and us . " I take orders from you , " he said . " You 're in charge here . And if you want Fat Boy to work , you 'll have to send me down the river to Trujillo . To get his vital juices . " Eventually , Father encouraged them to say , Yes , please go  --  " In the meantime , pick some of those tomatoes . Him "  --  hepoked Mr. Maywit 's flour-sack shirt  --  " he wants a Chinese store ! " Mother asked him how long he would be away . Father said heguessed anything up to a week , " barring unforeseen circumstances . " The next day , the Little Haddy , streamlined for the river , leftJeronimo for the coast . Mr. Haddy was working the sounding chainand Father was at the wheel . Mr. Haddy said for all to hear , " Butthis used to be me lanch . " We ran along the riverbank , nearly to Swampmouth , but lost them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar bills . With Father away , Jeronimo was very quiet  --  no speeches or songs , and the hammering stopped . The only sounds were the flap and splash , the prunt-prunt of the pump tower on the bank , and the sloosh of water in the culverts . The rest was the usual murmur of jungle , as continuous as silence , birds and bugs and monkey squawks , which changed in pitch with the heat and became a pressurizedhowl after nightfall . Mother did not take charge . When Father was around , we did things his way , he kept us jumping , but Mother had no inventions and never made speeches . When she did talk , it was often a gentle request for someone to show her the local way of doing something . The pepper-drying was a good example . After the small red peppersappeared in the low bushes , Mrs. Maywit said they would have to be dried . If Father had been around , he would have blazed a tensidedtub out of sheet metal and called it his Pepper Hopper , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he had made the fish trap and the bathhouse and the bamboo tiles.  |p165But  Mother got Mrs. Kennywick and Mrs. Maywit to explain how to string the peppers and hang them . " You know best , " she said . It was a day 's work , this pepper-stringing , Mother and the other women squatting side by side on a mat in the yard , knotting the peppers on twine so that the lengths of them looked like firecrackers . Father would not have done it , and he certainly would n't have squatted . He would have made himself a chair , probably a recliner , with a work surface , pedal-operated , maintenance-free , out of steamed and bent saplings . " Look how she fits the contours of the body , Mother ! " Mother had the Zambus teach her how to gut and skin animals like pacas , and how to peg fish to a plank and dry them , and how to smoke meat . They were slow , dirty , traditional methods , but she was in no hurry , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household tasks of the jungle people , the preparation of things we picked or caught . She made sure that each of us understood the gutting and smoking . We were not free to play until we had masteredthese chores . This was different from Father 's way . He was an innovator . He thought nothing of getting a dozen people to peel wood or dig ditches , and he would not tell them why until they had finished . Then he would say , " You 've just made yourself a permanent enhancement ! " Or he would ask them to guess what a particular thing was for ( no one so far had guessed what Fat Boy was for ) , and laugh when they gave him the wrong answer . He had his own way of doing things , and he liked telling people that their own methods were just waste motion . " Now I 'll show you how it ought to be done , " he 'd say , and as they gawked , he 'd add , " How do you like that little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he knew so much he did not have to listen . We had heard his voice going like the Thunderboxwherever we were , and since the day we arrived , Father 's chatter had been as constant as the Jeronimo locusts from morning to night , and it was louder even than the googn-googn-googn-googn of the howler monkeys . But now his voice was gone . Nothing was built , there were no inspections , the forge went cold . No talk of " targets , " no sessions in the Gallery , and we stopped hearing " I only need four hours ' sleep ! " We cleared the fish trap , weeded the garden , and picked the first tomatoes . Mother ran things smoothly , offering suggestions , notp166giving orders . She made cassava bread , something Father had not thought of doing . Mrs. Maywit provided the recipe . And Mrs. Kennywickshowed her how to make wabool out of rotten bananas . In her quiet , inquiring way , Mother discovered an amazing thing . She had the idea that it would be educational for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Jeronimo . She asked the Zambus what they were called , and what they were used for , so that a little printed sign could be tacked to each trunk for us to memorize . She found out that a good few of the trees at the southern end of the clearing were sapodillas . Even the Maywits did n't know that . The Zambus called them " chiclets " and " hoolies " and explained how to extract rubbery sap from the trees and boil it and pound it into sheets . " There 's enough chicle here to make a ton of rubber , " she said . She thought this was funny . " That 's what Allie would say . Wait till he hears . He 'll make us all galoshes . " Father 's work was work , Mother 's work was study and play , but mostly she left us to ourselves . We did not feel supervised as when Father was around , and little by little we ventured farther from the clearing , and even out of Jeronimo itself , away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monkeys . Leaving , hacking a path , and setting up a camp had been my idea . It was like one of Father 's challenges , but I challenged myself to go by daring the others  --  it gave me courage . We dared the Maywit children , too , and called them names , and soon they were shouting " Crummo " and " Crappo " at each other . Alice and Drainy were not afraid , but the little ones , Leon and Veryl ( who was known as Peewee ) , were timid and always lagged behind . We found a path that led away from the river and into a part of the jungle that was thick with screaming birds  --  bill-birds and crascos . There were monsters here , Drainy said , and all the Maywit kids agreed that it was in places like this that you met your Duppy . Cloversaid they were crapoid for thinking that . We put up our camp near a deep pool in a little pocket in the jungle , about half an hour 's walk from Jeronimo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the water , " Drainy said , and none of them would go into the pool . But it was because they did not know how to swim , which we did . Swimming there while they watched gave us a superior feeling , and Jerry told them they were spasticated . But they were not afraid of the water dogs or the snakes or green lizards . Some of those lizards were as big as cats . If we said , " There 's your Duppy in that tree , " they went crapoid , because they could n't see it . But when we saw a hairy piglike animal snufflingin the bushes , Alice said , " Oh , that 's a mountain cow . " It looked like a monster to me , but this little girl was not afraid , so we could n't be . For our camp here , we made first a lean-to out of branches , then a hut , and hammocks out of vines . Clover and Alice made seats for us , dug a firepit , and picked flowers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , but she knew how to get the Maywit kids working . I saw that she was just like Father . She was firm like him and would not listen and was n't happy unless she was directing operations . There was a certain fanlike plant here that was edible , Alice said  --  the roots of it . Clover got everyone collecting these roots in homemade baskets , and we ate them . They tasted like raw carrots and were called yautia . With these and the bananas and fruit we picked on the way , we could have meals in this camp . Clover complained that Jerry and April never helped . Alice said , " Peewee 's a crummo , for true . Always eating and never picking . " Drainy said he did more work than anyone . No one squabbled in Jeronimo , but here everyone fussed . So I decided to invent money . It was no good getting everything free . From now on , I said , we would have to buy our food at the camp store . " Where 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said the first thing that came into my head  --  " You 're sitting on it "  --  and pointed to her little bench . By making Clover the storekeeperI shut her up , and I explained that stones and pebbles would count as money , because they were in short supply in this mossy place . Leon said , " Want to buy some food , Ma . " " Where 's your money ? " " Ai n't got none . "  | " Then start digging . " This was a new game and a good one . We set out in search of stones , and everyone gathered a little pile . It was easy for me , becauseby diving into the pool I could pick up all the stones I wanted off the bottom . I became the richest person in the camp . Clover also ran the school , which was the first lean-to . Drainy ran the church  --  that was a tree on which he had fixed a wire cross . We made fences out of branches , and in one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radio set . That was imaginary , but the telephone was real  --  two coconut halves connected by a piece of string . " This is like back home , " Jerry said . But it was n't . It was the way other people lived , with radios and schools and churches  --  and money . Yet I was happy here in the camp  --  happier than in Jeronimo . I liked this place for its secrecy and best of all because it was filled with things that Father had forbidden . Spending money at the store and talking on the telephone were pleasant things . And when Clover ran out of lessons , I became the schoolteacher . I showed the Maywits how to count money and do arithmetic and write their names . Jerry wanted to put up a No Trespassing sign , but I said that would only make people curious . Instead , I got everyone to help dig a hole on the path for a man trap , to catch intruders or even big animals like mountain cows . Drainy said there were tigers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to catch one . We embedded sharpened stakes at the bottom of the trap and covered the whole thing with a layer of branches and dirt , to make it look like part of the path . That was the Zambu way , Drainy said . Father would have killed us for doing this , but he was still on the coast . We said prayers , we sang hymns that Alice taught us , and we held long groaning church services in the shelter of the holy tree . We still helped at Jeronimo , gathering peppers and weeding and seeing to the fish trap and doing our other chores . But when this work was done and Mother was satisfied , we escaped to our camp in the jungle , returning to all the things that Father hated . This made up for everything we had never had in Massachusetts and it stilled a longing in me for the United States . In this way , I overcame my homesickness . We called our camp the Acre . The Acre helped me to understand something of Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had not seen why he was so boastful of what he had made in Jeronimo . Father had insisted that we look closely at the garden and the paths and the waterworks . He wanted us to marvel at the way we could be bone-dry in the rain and cool on the hottest day and not be pestered by insects . He was happy , and at the Acre I knew why . I looked around and saw that the pattern of life and the things we had fixed ourselves were all ours . Even the Maywit children were pleased by what we had done . But I felt that ours was a greater achievement than Father 's , because we ate the fruit that grew nearby and used anything we found , and adapted ourselves to the jungle . We had not brought a boatload of tools and seeds , and we had not invented anything . We just lived like monkeys . It was Drainy 's idea that we should all be baptized . He said we would all go to hell if we were n't , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by getting into the deep pool while he said prayers over us . It seemed like fun , so we stripped down to our underwear and made ready for the baptism . " I 'm the baptizer , " Drainy said . " I know how to do this . " " Only thing , " Alice said . " Drainy do n't know how to swim . He cai n't be a baptizer if he cai n't swim . He get et up by the munsters in the water . " She walked away . I said to Drainy , " If you 're really afraid , we can forget it . " " I ai n't afraid , " Drainy said , and sat on the bank and dangled his feet in the water . " And you go to hell if you ai n't get dunked . " Clover said , " We do n't believe in hell . Only ignorant people believe in hell . " Drainy said , " If Alice pull down her bloomers and show her carkle , she go to hell , for true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head out of the window and yelled , " Drainy Roper , you get youself outta there ! " Then she clapped her hand over her mouth . " That ai n't his name , " she said . Clover said , " You called him Drainy Roper . Roper  --  that 's what that missionary said before Father kicked him out . " " That is our name , " Veryl said . " You got a mouf ! " Alice yelled . Drainy pulled his feet out of the pool and said , yes , that was their name , Roper . The missionary was right . And he was a Dunker . " If he was here , " Drainy said , " he could be the baptizer. "  | " If your name 's Roper , why is your name Maywit ? " Jerry asked . " They 've got two names , " April said . " We got one names , " Drainy said . " And it ai n't Maywit . " I said , " Where did the Maywit come from ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " And my father take it . " " If it was n't his name , " I said , " why did he take it ? " " He afraid , " Alice said . Drainy said , " Of you father . " " You 're crappo , " Clover said . Drainy said , " You father can do magic . " " What he does is n't magic  --  it 's science , " I said . " Science is worse , " Alice said . They would not believe me , and I was sorry , because Father had made them change their name . I said , " Sometimes I 'm afraid of him , too . " Jerry and the twins laughed at me for saying this . But they did not know what I knew . Clover said that Father was kind and not to be feared . He could have made a fortune as an inventor , Jerry said . " Why do n't he get rich ? " Alice said . " Because he wanted to come here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jungle . More than a town . " This did not convince the Maywit children , and when I told them that Father had said there was a war coming in the United States they just laughed . This made me lose heart and talk hollowly , for why else would anyone ditch the United States to sweat his guts out in the jungle ? And I knew more than that . I had seen the inside of Fat Boy . That glimpse came back to me , and now , whenever I thought of Father , I saw the hanging tanks , the wilderness of crooked iron , the tubes like a brain in a sleeve , and all the tiny hinges . It had been like seeing the inside of someone 's house , and , by studying it , knowing them better . I knew a person best from something he had made , and in Fat Boy I had seen Father 's mind , a version of it  --  its riddle and slant and its hugeness  --  and it had scared me . It was because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we skipped the baptism altogether and went and collected crazy ants instead . We floated them on the pool and watched them struggle on the skin of the water 's surface . Returning from the Acre that day , we saw Little Haddy at thep171mooring . Some men were carrying tall bottles of gas up the path to Fat Boy , and others were rolling steel drums along logs that served as rails . Peewee let out a yell when she saw Father . He was outside Fat Boy , working a hand pump , emptying one of the drums into a pipe . What frightened Peewee was his mask . It was a gas mask , for safety , but it gave him a snout and huge bug eyes . A skull and bones was stenciled on the drum . " He always wears that when he 's working with poison , " I said . This word poison had a worse effect on the Maywit kids than the weevil mask , and they ran straight into their house with their fingers in their mouths . It had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trujillo to Jeronimo . Mother told us the story of his adventures . Threats in the town . Nosy people . Honduran soldiers accusinghim of smuggling explosives . Arguments and almost a fistfight . " How many pushups can you do ? " Trouble with vultures . A hard time on the river , which was too shallow in places . Scraping the boat bottom and being followed by unfriendly Zambus and more vultures . A slow and dangerous trip . Into Jeronimo with their keel dragging on the riverbed . There were only four gas masks  --  Father , Haddy , Harkins , and F. Lungley . Because of the danger of fumes , we were not allowed near Fat Boy until the transfer of ammonia and hydrogen was made and the pipes sealed . Father worked all night without lamps or firelight . The full moon gave the clearing a milky-pink shine , like mother-of-pearl , and Fat Boy looked like a block of dark marble , a monument or tomb in the jungle . The four masked men jumbled in and out of Fat Boy , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles , and Father saying " Watch it ! " and " Careful ! " and " Move over ! " and the howler monkeys they called baboons , their googn ! In the morning , Father was highly excited . If anything had gone wrong , he said , we would have been blown sky-high along with half the valley  --  probably ended up in Hatfield , in smithereens . " I have just spent the most dangerous twelve hours of my whole life , " he said . " Sounds to me as if it was dangerous for us too , " Mother said . " Sure , but you were n't aware of the danger , so you could sleep in blissful ignorance . "  |p172Mother  said " I like that , " and turned her back on him . " I am the only person here who knows how lethal that stuff is . I took full responsibility . Was I scared ? No , ma'am . " " We might have been killed ! " " You would n't have known what hit you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been atomized , with a smile on your face . " Mother said , " Thanks , pal . " " Do n't worry . All the seals are on . In fact , this afternoon I 'm going to fire him up . " Father saw me listening in the doorway . " Quit grinning and spread the news , Charlie . I want everyone over there to watch . " " This is why I 'm here , " Father said , after lunch . " This is why I came . " He was standing in front of Fat Boy 's firebox with a handful of matches . Mr. Haddy was next to him , and the Maywits nearby with their gray-faced kids . Clover and April sat on the ground with the Zambus , Harkins and Peaselee on kegs , Mrs. Kennywick in the armchair she had dragged over from Swampmouth . There were some other strangers watching from beyond the beanfields . " I 'll bet you still do n't know what this is for , " Father said . " Cooking , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No guesses , " Father said . " You saw Lungley and Dixon put those trays of water on the shelf inside this monster . Now we 're going to light a little fire here with this weeny match . " " Steam engine . Boiler work . " Mr. Haddy clowned for the nervous people . " Can it ! But stick around . You wo n't believe your eyes . " He called Peewee over and said that as she was the youngest it was she who should light the first fire . " When we 're all dead and gone , you 'll still be around , Peewee . You can tell your grandchildrenthat you were here on this historic day . Tell them you lit the fire . " Father struck a match on the seat of his pants and showed her where to hold it . There was some kindling in the firebox . Peewee put the match to it and up it went.  |p173The  Zambus grasped their ears , Ma Kennywick blew out her cheeks , and Mr. Maywit said , " Never mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire pop . The birds and bugs of Jeronimo went silent . The people held their breaths and went shiny-faced with waiting . A single gloop dropped inside Fat Boy , as of liquid plunging in a pipe 's plump bubble , and we moved , turning from the fire to where the sound had glooped in Fat Boy 's midsection . Now we could all hear each other breathe . Mr. Haddy licked his teeth . " Shoo ! " " Wait for it , " Father said . More plungings , and the trembling of pipes , and the creak of swelling tanks  --  it was a sense , announced in muffled percolations , of loosening in Fat Boy 's belly . It was not one clear sound , but rather a vibration in the plant and all around it . The ground hummed beneath our feet . Liquid was shifting , still rising , and there was a final surge that slowed the vibrations , and the whole plant seemed to stir . The surrounding jungle murmured to the same beat , which was like the throb of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almighty bowel movement . Mr. Maywit said , " They is queerness coming out from the chim-bly . " " Smoke , " Father said . " He stop bellyaching , " Drainy whispered . Father said , " This is going to take a little while . Everyone get comfy . Sit down where you are and let your mind wander . But do n't think about war or madness . " " They is just what I think about , " Ma Kennywick said . Mrs. Maywit put her chicken eyes on Father and said , " Kin we pray ? " " If you feel the need , go right ahead . But I honestly wish you would n't , because then you 'll treat this as a miracle  --  which it is n't . Rather than as a magnified piece of thermodynamics  --  which it is . " But I could tell from their faces and postures that they were all praying . They sat compactly , with their necks drawn in , like birds in the rain . From time to time , Father stoked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done  --  it was a small fire , and after it started its whistlesand sucks , he kept it damped down . " This is where it 's all happening , " Father said . " This is the cen/ter of the world ! You do n't have to go anywhere  --  you 're where it 's at ! " A half-hour passed in this way . Then Father stopped talking and climbed the stepladder . He read the thermometer that stuck out , and he looked pretty satisfied . Fifteen more minutes , he said , and after that time had gone he mounted the ladder again and crawled into the hatchway . " Hope we ai n't have to drag him out by his stumps , " Mr. Haddy said . Some people hissed , and Mr. Haddy and others looked at Mother . She said , " Allie knows what he 's doing  --  and here he comes . " Father 's head was in the hatchway . He made a face  --  hard to tellwhat kind , he was so far up . He waved his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of raw cotton . " What Fadder got there ? " Father was shouting . " Have n't you people ever seen a snowball ? " He threw it , and it mashed in the grass , whiter than a heron 's feathers . We ran to touch it  --  and as we touched it , feeling the sting of its crystals , it began to vanish . But by then , in triumph , Father was bringing out the cakes of ice.  |p175ON  THIS PART of the river , narrower and shallower than anything I had seen  --  twenty miles of it , before mountains and jungle twisted it into a trickle  --  people dropped to their knees on the banks and waved at us and prayed . By now , they knew who we were and what we carried . The news of Fat Boy had spread throughout the river valley . " Anyone want a beverage ? " Father called to those people on the bank who took us for missionaries . Mr. Haddy thought this question was very funny , and he wheezed whenever Father said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the river , Father caught Mr. Haddy 's eye and yelled , " Anyone here require a beverage ? " and made the man laugh . But the kneeling and respectfulness at last made Father gloomy . " The idiots think we came all this way to honk Bibles at them ! " Five of us were on the boat  --  besides Father , Mr. Haddy , and me , there was Clover and Francis Lungley . It was not the Little Haddy . Our new boat , built in the weeks after Fat Boy began producingice , was an adaptation of a pipanto dugout , needle-nosed , wide-bellied , and almost flat-bottomed . It was powered by a pedal mechanism that worked a stern wheel , something like the Swan boats in the Boston Public Garden . Because of its shape and its cargo , Father named the boat the Icicle . Except for the pedals and the sprockets and part of the chain ( they were from Mr. Harkins 's bike  --  " I cannibalized his Raleigh ! " Father said ) , the driving mechanism of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some small parts by the wire-nibbling teeth of Drainy Maywit . " That kid 's a human micrometer ! " Amidships , Father had outrigged an ice-storage vault . There were two seats forward , and two side by side in the stern , in front of the pedaler'scockpit , which Father called " the Wishing Well  --  because whoever 's pedaling in it wishes he was somewhere else . " Going upstream , Francis worked the pedals . It was the perfect boat for the upper river . Father claimed that it was so buoyant he could go cross-country in it , providing there was a smidgen of dew on the grass . Mr. Haddy said , " These people never see no lanch like this one . " " You 're joking , " Father said . " They 've seen everything . River travel is easy . This is a turnpike . Missionaries have been tooling up and down here in canoes for years . Frankly , I do n't regard this as much of an accomplishment . " " Tell you one thing , " Mr. Haddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat behind Clover  --  " they ai n't have no ice with them ! " " That 's a matter of conjecture  --  " Francis Lungley screamed at the word. "  --  but they were here . " Mr. Haddy shrugged . He was wearing one of the La Rosa flour sacks Mother had made into shirts . His back said , Enriquecida con Vitaminas . " I want to penetrate where they 've never been , " Father said . There were blue butterflies kiting to the ferny branches that overhungthe river , startled by our noise . The tumble and splash of our foot-operated wheel sounded like a washing machine sudsing clothes . I could recognize some of the birds in the trees  --  the jays and the ivory-billed woodpecker , the cockatoos and crascos  --  and I knew the cries of the hidden ones  --  the sudden honk of the smaller pava , the shouts of the forest quail , and the bass-fiddle boom of the curassow . These same birds lived near our camp at the Acre , still our secret hiding place from Father and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a load of ice to the hottest , darkest , nastiest corner of Honduras , where they pray for water and never see ice , and have never heard of cans , much less aerosol cans . " " But Seville like that , " Francis Lungley said , bobbing his headp177as he pedaled . He was wearing a La Rosa shirt too . His said , Molino Harinero and 45.36 Kgs Netos . " For true , Seville is dirt . " He had been promising Seville ever since Father demanded the poorest place imaginable . This had started one of the first arguments in Jeronimo . Mr. Haddy , Mr. Harkins , and Mr. Peaselee wanted to take the ice downstream to Santa Rosa or Trujillo . Father asked , what was the point of that ? Big ships called at those ports those towns had more electricity than was good for them . " You just want to impress your friends . No , we 're going up-stream . " That was when Francis Lungley said that he had once been to Seville , as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the others said they were not going to a stewy bat-shoo place where people had no respect and probably had tails . But Father was interested . Francis said he had almost died there twice  --  first from fright , next from hunger . It was a falling-down village , where the people ate dirt and looked like monkeys  --  anyway , ugly as monkeys . They had rat hair and most were naked . They were not even Christians . " That sounds like my kind of place , " Father said . Then Mr. Haddy agreed and said , oh , yes , heathens were the best fishermen and the strongest paddlers and " Those boys knows how to work , for true . " But as we sudsed up the river ( monkeys on the right , kinkajous on the left ) , Father said , " I find it hard to believe that some missionary has n't been here before and bought their souls with Twinkies and cheese spread in spray cans and crates of Rice-a-Roni . " He watched a monkey on a branch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked back at the monkey . " Diet Pepsi . " Now he turned to the kinkajous . " Kool-Aid . " He flicked his cigar butt into the river . " Makes your mouth water , does n't it ? " " You see Seville , Fadder , " Francis said , pedaling harder , his La Rosa shirt black with sweat . " I want to see a wreck of a village that has n't got a name , where they 've been swatting mosquitoes and eating rancid wabool for two thousand years . " Father pointed to the mountains . " Over those baffles , where it 's all hell and they 're being roasted alive ! " " Too bad we ai n't back of Brewer 's Lagoon , " Mr. Haddy said . " Some of them villages is rubbish . "  |p178We  had started before dawn  --  so early , the nighttime mosquitoes were still out and biting us . But by noon , though we had gone miles , we were some distance from the mountains of Olancho that marked the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a riverbank for lunch . It was so thickly overgrown we could not get off the boat . The bank was hidden under bush fans and yards of lianas . Mother had packed us a basket of fruit and cassava bread and fresh tomatoes and a Jeronimo drink that Father called Jungle Juice , made from guavas and mangoes . Clover said the juice was n't cold enough . " It 's plenty cold enough , " Father said . " Listen , no one 's touching that ice ! " He checked the vault on the boat to make sure the ice was still holding up . The ice was wrapped in banana leaves and the vault lined with rubber we had tapped from the hoolie trees . He had not made us galoshes after all . " You 're bound to lose a little , " he said . The ice had shrunk in its banana-leaf wrappings . " Seepage . Natural wastage . Friction "  --  he was plumping it with his hands  --  " owing to excessive agitation . Right , Francis ? " Francis Lungley was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingertips , like opening a present . " I mean , how are we doing ? " The village of Seville was some way off , Francis said . He could not say exactly how far . He squinched his face when Father asked him the miles . " How many men paddling the cayuka when you were here be-fore ? " " No cayuka , " Francis said . " Just foots . " He showed us his cracked feet . His ankles were oily from pedaling the boat . Father blew up . " Now he tells us ! He walked ! For all we know , we might not get there until tomorrow . " He yanked the stern painter from the branch and said the lunch break was over . " If you want to stay here , you can , " he said to me . " But we 're not going to hang around and watch you feed your face . " I stuffed the sandwich I had made into my pocket , and we cast off . Soon , with Father 's barking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you brooding about ? " I said , " I wanted to pick one of those avocados back there . " " You 're seeing things , " Father said . " There are n't any avocados around here . "  |p179But  there were  --  small , wild avocados . We had eaten them at the Acre . Alice Maywit had identified them . The Zambu John had told her about them . We peeled them and mashed them with salt and planted the seeds . I looked at Francis , but his eyes were turned on Father . " Ai n't real butter pears , " Francis said . " Just bush kind . " " If I 've got so many authorities on board , how come we 're makingsuch slow progress ? " No river is straight . They only turn and go crosswise and sometimeslead you backward  --  the nose of your boat heading into the direction you just left . River travel is like forever being turned back and not getting there . The sun shifts sideways from the bow to starboard , where it sways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it slips astern . You know you 've been going forward , but the sun is n't i n your face any longer  --  it is heating the back of your head . Some minutes later it is beating on your knuckles . Then it is back to starboard . Another reach and it is burning around the boat , useless to navigate by . All it tells you is how much time has passed . For coastal sailing , the sun is a good guide , but it was confusing here . In the jungle , all rivers are mazes , and this one was mazier than most  --  it was something only a small cayuka or an ingenious pipantolike ours could negotiate . The bad part was not that we were going backward , but that we seemed to be going nowhere . We would come to a bank choked with water lilies and hyacinths and green ruffled leaves , and see a bend of open water . We would turn and follow that bend . After half an hour , as the hyacinths piled up and the branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces and pushed Father 's baseball cap sideways , we would realize that we had come the wrong way . Or we were in a swamp that was packed as solid as land , or a lagoon surrounded by black trees , or knocking against stumps . Then we had to go back and suds our way through the thick flowers and logs we had taken for a bank . Once past these barriers , we would travel on what seemed a new river or a tributary , now narrow , now wide as a pond and no opening . So the sun went round and round , and Father cursed and said , why did you have to go fifty river miles to advance five land miles ? He mapped the river as we went , marking the shallows and the bends and the false turns , the sandbar crescents on the reaches , the swamps and lagoons  --  all the deceptions of its straggling course . It was more than a crumpled shape . It was a bunch of knots , tangledp180like worms in winter , that made no sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a so-and-so labyrinth and said that if he had a dredger and a barge full of dynamite he would twist the bends out of it and knock it straight , so that you could see daylight from one end to the other . This was the subject of his speeching . When we were led into a swamp by the temptation of open water , Father said , " I 'm going to do something about that "  --  and the islands  --  " I 'll sink them , first chance I get "  --  and the ponds  --  " Strap a channel through here , canalize it  --  all I need is dynamite and willing hands . " Father was now at the bow with Clover , while Mr. Haddy took his turn on the pedals . " Clear all this obstruction away  --  make some kind of scoop that cuts this sargasso weed at its roots and lifts it free . Get this mess into shape . How very American , you 're all saying  --  the man wants to bring permanent changes to this peaceful jungle ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't intend to make it commercial . Gaw , I like to get my hand on this , " and he grinned at the tangles and bends . " It really makes me mad ! " He was getting redder in the face , and , being tall , he looked uncomfortablesquatting at the needle nose of this narrow boat . He kept his hands on his hips and swayed like someone riding a bike with no hands . Every so often , he poked his head into the storage vault and said , " At least the ice is holding up , which is more than I can say for the crew . Pedal , Mr. Haddy ! Stop catching crabs . Are you looking for avocados , too ? " We passed a semicircle of huts . Francis Lungley called it a village . " I see signs of corruption , " Father said . " I see a tin can ! " At anothergroup of riverbank huts , he said , " It 's all gum wrappers ! " There was only one more village , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stand of banana trees . This made Father hopeful . Two men sat at the river 's edge clumping submerged stones with boulders . Francis Lungley said the men were fishing  --  stunningthe creatures under the stones . They turned the stones over after they clumped them , and pulled out squashed eels and tadpoles and frogs . " We must be getting close , " Father said . Francis slapped himself on the head . " I forgit ! Them mahoganies ! " He smiled at the trees as if he expected them to smile back . " It near here . "  |p181Father  looked satisfied . " They did n't cut them down . Nothing to cut them down with . Primitive tools . Nothing to use the trees for . Just sit back and watch them grow . Now that 's a very good sign . " Here , grass spikes grew out of the water , and the trunks of short cut-off trees stood in pools . Clumps of spinach bobbed in the river , and the lianas were black and dangling , like high-voltage wires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wreckage and might have been the mess left by a subsided flood . In what was supposed to be river , there were shoots of fountainy leaves , and the land steamed with crater holes of scummy water . Mud and mosquitoes  --  and it was hard to tell where the river ended and the land began . There was no definite riverbank , and if it had not been for the tall trees behind it all , I think we would have turned around and gone back  --  we certainly could not have gone any further . Many of the smaller trees were dead , and on the deadest ones were brown pods , quivering under the branches . " Bats , " Mr. Haddy said . " They 's bats . " He repeated his bloodsucking story to Clover , but she said , " You ca n't scare me . " Staring at some bushes , I saw human faces . The faces were entirelystill and round and staring back at me with white eyes that did not blink . I was not scared until I remembered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us thrash our boat through the spinach and the weeds . Father saw them . He said , " I 've got a little surprise for you . " At his voice , and while we were still looking at them , the faces vanished . They did not move , they just disappeared  --  goggling at us one minute , gone the next . They had turned into leaves , but not even the leaves moved . " Out to lunch , " Father said . " Get the duckboards . We 're going after them . You first , Charlie . " " Why me ? " But I knew I should not have asked . Father said , " Because you 're the bravest one here , sonny . " This was not true . But the risks that Father made me take were his way of showing me there were no risks . On the rock in Baltimore , up the kingpost of the Unicorn , climbing through Fat Boy  --  it had all been a kind of training for times like this . Father wanted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was preparing me for worse , for this tiptoeing through the spinachy swamp on duckboards , and teetering past the scummy pools and the vine tubes.  | " Stamp your feet , Charlie . " I did so and a snake , hanging in six bracelets from a low branch , gathered itself and dropped into the water and swam away . After that , I stamped my feet every chance I got , and further on a short fat viper , surprised by the clomp of my shoe , wormed into a stump hole until only its gray tail tip showed . Father was saying , " Never can tell about these people . They might be Munchies  --  haw ! " We got through thirty yards of this by passing the last duckboard ahead and repeating this process to make a walkway through the mush . It was hard to believe there had been people right here , standing in the swamp . How had they disappeared without making a splash ? We came to bushes like hedges , and past them the trees were taller and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and birds so small they might have been insects , screamed around our heads . Above the tops of the mahogany trees there were bigger birds , perched or making shadowy flights , like flying turkeys . Their wings made slow broomlike brushings against the treetops . They might have been curassows I heard bull-fiddle twangs  --  but Fathersaid they were vultures and that he wanted to wring their scrawny scavenging necks . " Seville , " Francis said , and pointed to an opening some yards ahead  --  more jungle , except that it was dark here and sunny there . Gnats and flies spiraled in the light and speckled it . Mr. Haddy said , " I ai n't like this place so soon . " " What kind of houses are those , Dad ? " Clover asked . " That kind of dwelling , of course  --  " He never admitted not knowing something , but these huts were not easy to explain . They were small tufty humps made from the same spiky grass we had walked through on the duckboards . A framework of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top . Not huts  --  more like beehives that needed haircuts. "  --  that 's probably where they keep their animals , Muffin , " Fathersaid . " Got no animals here , " Francis said . " I ai n't see one . " " All the better , " Father said . " If they actually live in those things , then we came to the right place . "  |p183Mr  . Haddy chuckled and said to me , " The right places for Fadder is always the wrong places for me . " Father looked gladly on the miserable village . Yet only the huts were miserable . This jungle , the start of the high forest , was tall and orderly . Each tree had found room to grow separately . The trees were arranged in various ways , according to slendernessor leaf size , the big-leafed ones at the jungle floor , the towering trees with tiny leaves rising to great heights , and the ferns in between . I had always pictured jungle as suffocating spaghetti tangles , drooping and crisscrossed , a mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stank in your face and flung its stalks around you . This was more like a church , with pillars and fans and hanging flowers and only the slightest patches of white sky above the curved roof of branches . There was nothing smothering about it , and although it was noisy with birds , it was motionless  --  no wind , not even a breeze in the moisture and green shadows and blue-brown trunks . And no tangles  --  only a forest of verticals , hugely patient and protective . It was like being indoors , with a pretty roof overhead . And the order and size of it made the little huts beneath look especially dumpy . The village  --  if it was a village  --  was deserted . Without people there , it was like the crust of a camp , where some travelers , too lazy or sick to make proper lean-tos , had hacked some bushes apart , shoveled a fire next to a rock , and spent one uncomfortable night before setting off again to die somewhere . The only sign of life was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trash  --  fruit peels and chewed cane stalks  --  and did n't bother getting up . I gave the hungry thing the sandwich I had stuffed into my pocket at lunchtime . He tried to bite me , then he ate the sandwich . In the centerof the five huts , all made of grass tufts , was a smoky firepit , and some broken calabashes . There was not a human here to be seen . But we had seen faces back at the duckboards . Mr. Haddy said , " I ai n't blame them for fetching out of this place . Lungley , what you say is for true . This is dirt . " He was glancing around and wetting his teeth as he spoke . " We could go home , Fadder . We could slap we own mosquitoes . " Father was fanning himself with his baseball cap . He said , " They ca n't be far away . Probably down at the drive-in hamburger stand . "  |p184He  looked up and saw Mr. Haddy walking away , in the direction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This stiffened Mr. Haddy like an arrow between his shoulders . He turned around laughing in a sneezing sort of way . " Or , on the other hand , " Father said  --  he had bent over and picked something from the ground  --  " maybe they 're getting their flashlights repaired . Take a gander at this so-called consumer dura-ble . " It was a crumbled flashlight battery , its rusted case burst open and the paint peeled off and barely recognizable , it was so squashed . It looked like an old sausage . " Francis , you said they were savages ! " The poor Zambu , who maybe had never seen a flashlight battery  --  flashlights were forbidden in Jeronimo  --  just smiled at Fatherand showed his teeth like a dog hearing a door slam . " But if they 're using these gimcrack things , they probably are sav-ages . " We sat down and waited and watched the wee-wee ants . " Could be at the gas station , in a long line , waiting to fill up with high-test . " " Ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You would n't kid me , would you ? " There was evidence that someone was living here  --  straw beds in the huts , flies rotating over the trash pile , and a tripod with a burned baby on it , or , the nearest thing to it , a roasted monkey with curledupfingers and toes . Father said , " How did you talk to them when you were here be-fore ? " Francis opened his mouth and wagged his blue tongue . " What language ? " Francis did not know what Father meant . He said he just talked to them and they talked to him . " They savvy . " This was a Jeronimo explanation . People spoke English , Spanish , and Creole , but they did not know when they were going from one language to another . It seemed that by looking into a person 's face , they knew what language to use , and sometimes they mixed them all together , so that what came out sounded like a new language . I had the habit myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not realizep185that I was not speaking English . But everyone on the Mosquito Coast , no matter what he looked like or what language he spoke , said he was English . Pacing the clearing with Clover , Father looked like a man showing his daughter around the zoo  --  impatient and proud and talking the whole time and sort of holding his nose . Then , from the other side of the firepit , we heard his loud voice . " Okay , the game 's over . We can see you ! Stop hiding  --  you 're just wasting your time ! Come on out of there , we 're not going to hurt you ! Get out from behind those trees ! " His voice rang against the jungle 's straight trees and high ceiling . He kept it up for several minutes , yelling at the bushes , while we watched . Clover peered at the ferns Father was beating with a stick . He looked the way Tiny Polski had when he was flushing bobwhites in Hatfield . The amazing thing was , it worked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty of them . This took place as we were staring , and they appeared in the same way as they had vanished before , without a movement or a sound . One second , Father was shouting " Come on out ! " in the empty clearing , and the next second the people were there and he was shouting the same thing in their faces . We did not know whether Father had really seen them or was just pretending . The women wore ragged dresses and the men wore shorts . But these clothes did not hide their nakedness . They seemed to represent clothes rather than serve any covering purpose . We could see their private parts through the rips and tears . And the children  --  Clover'sage and mine  --  were stark naked , which was embarrassing . " Carkles and wilks , " Mr. Haddy said , and stuck his teeth out . Father said , " They do n't look so bad to me . Are you sure this is the place ? " Francis said it was . We expected Father to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the people , as if he had known them a long time , and he said , " Okay , let 's go " over his shoulder  --  meaning them . " Follow me  --  we 've got work to do . " Three of the men  --  they looked a little like Francis , except that they were nakeder and had bushier hair  --  followed Father to the duckboards.  | " You stay here , " Father said to us . " Relax , get acquainted , make yourselves known . " He went off impatiently , whacking at flies with his hat , and then we heard him kicking the duckboards to scare snakes . The three men followed him without a word . Clover said , " He 's right at home anywhere . " She sounded like Mother . The people stared at Clover through the haze from the firepit 's smoke . They had gray blurred faces and wore scorched rags . Mud was caked on their legs . " See-ville , man , " Mr. Haddy said . " What a spearmint ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two time . " Now the people looked at us . " What you do to these folks , Lungley ? " " Ai n't do nothing . " " How is it ? " Mr. Haddy spoke to the people . He stuck out his teeth and opened his mouth to listen . No one replied . " Must be ailing , " Mr. Haddy whispered . The naked children hid behind their parents . We looked at each other across the clearing , and it was like looking across the world . They turned their heads . An old man limp-scraped into the clearingfrom the pillars of the forest trees . He wore a pair of cut-off striped pants , wire glasses , and socks but no shoes  --  his toenails were yellow in the rips . A rag was knotted around his neck . There were broken straws in his hair . He wore a bicycle clip on each wrist like a bracelet . " That is the Gowdy , " Francis said . " Look like he require a bevidge , " Mr. Haddy said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father 's . He was hidden and saying , " Careful ! Steady there ! Do n't drop them ! " We had packed the ice so carefully in banana leaves that the blocks were like parcels , tied with vines . The silent men carried two parcels apiece . Father led them to the middle of the clearing and directed that the parcels be placed on the ground . " Who 's in charge here ? " Father said . " Man with speckles , " Francis said . " He the Gowdy . " He nodded at the man who stood slightly forward of the group of staring people . Seeing our eyes on him , the old man clawed some of the straws out of his hair.  |p187Father  shook the man 's hand . " You the Gowdy ? " " Gowdy , " the man said , and he giggled . " We 've got a little surprise for you , " Father said in his friendly way . " Want to get those other people over here ? " He took out his jackknife and winked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . " When the people were close , Father cut the vines and pushed the leaves aside , uncovering one block of ice . He stabbed his knife blade like an ice pick and hacked off a corner . He gave this hunk of ice to the Gowdy . The old man bobbled it , just as Tiny Polski had done back in Hatfield , not knowing whether it was hot or cold . The people gatheredaround to touch it . They laughed and pushed to get near it and stepped on their children . The ones who touched the ice smelled their fingers , or walked a little distance away to lick them . Father was still winking at us as he spoke to the old man , the Gowdy . " What 's the verdict ? " " Good morning to you , sah . I am well , thank you . Where are you garng . I am garng to the bushes . " The Gowdy 's wire glasses had been knocked crooked by the pushing people . " Today is Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He bobbled the ice as he spoke . " Has n't the slightest idea , " Father said to us . The ice was melting in the old man 's hand . Water ran down his arm , leaving dirt streaks on his skin . It dripped from the knob at his elbow . " Completely in the dark , " Father said . He put his arm around the old man 's shoulders and gave him a wide smile . The Gowdy shivered . " What 's that ? " Father said , and pointed . " Hice , " the Gowdy said . " Jesus Christ Almighty ! " Father roared , and gave the Gowdy a shove , nearly knocking the old man over . But no sooner had he spoken than every one of the people , including the Gowdy , dropped to his knees . The sudden movement startled the birds . A great uprush of them , big and small , shook the branches overhead , and these birds alerted the roosting birds , which took off like turkeys from the treetops . The sick puppy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their throats and murmuring.  | " Ah Fadder wart neven hello bead name  --  " " Cut it out ! " Father said . " Get up  --  off your knees ! " He tried to drag them up , then he turned to Francis and screamed , " You traitor , you gave me a bum steer ! Thanks a lot ! " Mr. Haddy was laughing softly , relieved that they were Christians . And maybe he was secretly glad that Father , who seldom made mistakes , had blundered by taking ice here , when Mr. Haddy himself could more easily have shipped it to the coast and made a greater impression . He went forward to calm the confused people , who were still gasping and praying , and said , " You is good folks , but this is bush for true . " Father was so angry he vanished in the way the people in Seville had near the duckboards . He went up in a puff of smoke , leaving only his angry smell behind . We removed the rest of the parcels from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they had seen ice four or five times . They said it was wonderful stuff and they described it as cold stones that turned into water . Missionaries had brought it to them , and they believed that we were missionaries , too , and Father was our preacher . They wanted to know where we lived and if we had any food or salt to give them . The Gowdy boasted that everyone in the village was baptized . He said they were waiting  --  waiting to go to Heaven and see the Lord Jesus . Mr. Haddy said it was a pretty rotten place to wait , full of monkey-shoo , but he could understand why they wanted to leave as soon as possible , for Heaven or anywhere else . Father returned  --  too late to hear any of this , which was just as well . " I walked around the block , " he said . He would not speak to anyone in Seville . He said only that Francis had betrayed him . When the Gowdy tried to get the people started on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumb with a hammer , and then said he would wait for us on the boat . We left Seville . The people had begun to quarrel over the ice . Father 's moodiness made the trip back to Jeronimo mostly silent . But it was a faster trip . The contours of the river were not strange to us anymore , and the current was with us . Father made improvementson his map and we did not take any wrong turns . I worked the pedals . Father sat in the bow with Clover on his lap , sulking over his map , because the Seville people had seen ice beforeand because they prayed . " They might as well be in Hatfield ,  |p189cutting  asparagus , " was all he said . He hugged Clover , like a big boy with a teddy bear . Francis and Mr. Haddy knew they were beingignored . They crouched amidships in the ice-storage vault with nothing to do . After a while , Francis said he saw pipantos . Someone was followingus , he said . Father did not reply or turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , looking past me . " Pipanto . " I glanced around but did not see anything . I had the steering to attend to . " Me yerry , " Francis whispered . He began muttering like a bush Zambu . He said he heard six paddlers  --  three pipantos . " Never see no lanch like this , " Mr. Haddy said . Darkness came . It seemed to grow out of the riverside . The trees swelled , fattened by the blackness . The high curve went out of the sky . Pinheads of stars appeared and brightened into blobs . " They still back of us in the rock-stone . " And night was around us . The water still held a slippery glimmer ahead , and behind us was the paddle wheel 's loose froth , spreading in the current . Soon we saw the lanterns of Jeronimo and the sparks from Fat Boy 's chimney stack . The lights were small and very still on shore , but they poured from the bank and leaked yellow pools into the river . I heard someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom that night , Jerry said , " I could have gone with Dad . But I did n't want to . We were at the Acre all day . Ma let us . " " I saw two snakes , " I said . " One almost bit me . " " We built another man trap . You do n't know where it is . You 'll fall in and kill yourself , Charlie . " " Go to sleep , crappo . " Later , through the bamboo wall , I heard Mother consoling Father . At first I thought she was speaking to April or Clover , her voice was so soft . But she was talking about the ice , and the boat , and his hard work . It was all brilliant , she said . She was proud of him , and nothing else mattered . Father did not object . He said , " It was n't what I expected . I did n't want that . They prayed at me , Mother . " " I 'd like to go upstream sometime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not what you think . You wo n't like it . It 's bad , but in the most boring way . Oh , I suppose they 're all right  --  they 'll bep190able to use the ice for something . But what can you do with people who 've already been corrupted ? It makes me mad . " It was two weeks before we went back to Seville , and in those two weeks we kids spent more time at the Acre , in our little camp by the pool . It pleased me to think that our camp was sturdier than anything in Seville . We wove hammocks out of green vines . We ate wild onions . The hammocks gave us rashes , the onions gave us cramps . A water dog crept out of the pool one day and we chased it into a trap and beat it to death with sticks . Then we cut it into pieces and dried the meat strips on a tripod , Zambu-style . But the next day the meat strips were gone . Peewee said a monster had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an animal , because the tripod was not high enough . We collected berries . Some were to eat , and others kept mosquitoesaway if you rubbed them on your skin and let the juice dry . Alice Maywit showed us a cluster of purple ones and said , " These is poison . " Clover said , " I do n't believe you . You 're afraid of everything . I bet they 're blackberries or something . " " Want to eat one , girl ? " Drainy said . He showed her his wirebendingteeth . Clover looked as though she was willing to try , just to show off and prove she was right , but I punched her hard and told her to stay away from them . " No hitting ! " she said . " That 's the rule  --  Dad said so ! " " This is n't Jeronimo , " I said . " This is our Acre and we have our own rules . " That was the pleasure of the Acre  --  that we could do whatever we wanted . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traps and poison . No inventions or machines . We had secrets  --  why , we even knew the Maywits ' real name . We could pretend we were schoolchildren , or we could live like Zambus . That day was a good example . Drainy suggested that we take off all our clothes , and he pulled down his own shorts to show he was serious . Then Peewee did the same , and so did Clover and the others . Alice yanked her dress over her head and dropped her bloomers , and I stepped out of my shorts.  |p191The  eight of us stood there giggling and stark naked , but I was so ashamed I jumped into the pool and pretended I wanted to swim , while the others compared bodies and danced around . Alice was standing at the lip of the pool . " Ever see a carkle ? " She knelt with her knees apart and pinched the black wrinkles in her fingers , and for a moment I thought I was going to drown . " What 's that ? " She closed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noises . Alice said she heard horseflies . She saw one coming toward her and she looked steadily at it and got very worried . She said it meant there were strangers about . We quickly put on our clothes and left the camp by the river path . Minutes later , we saw canoes . They were Indians , Alice said . She had known that from the horsefly . The canoes were old and waterloggeddugouts , and the paddlers looked like the Seville people , their thin arms sticking out of rags , and broken straws in their bushy hair . " They 're trying to spy on us , " Jerry said . But they could not see us watching them . We had outsmarted them , and we laughed softly  --  even April , who was usually afraid  --  seeing them struggling upstream in their old canoes . " They 're coming from Jeronimo , " Clover said . " Good thing they ai n't see us naked ! " Drainy said . " They 'll never find our camp , " I said . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we had this safe place in the jungle . And now , because I had seen Seville , I knew that ours was a well-ordered camp  --  better than the villages made by real jungle people . We mentioned the canoes in Jeronimo . No one had seen them . Father said , " Maybe Munchies ! Maybe Duppies ! " and tried to frighten the Maywits . On the morning Father said we were going back to Seville , Mr. Peaselee , who was doing fireman duty , let Fat Boy 's fire go out . The ice melted . Father said , " We might have to cancel the trip . Everyone to the Gallery ! " He gave a lecture about responsibility and good habits , and did we think Fat Boy could live without care and attention ? Fat Boy was kind because we were careful , but if we were careless he would turn dangerous . If we neglected to do our duty , he would split open and take his revenge by killing us all . Father said , " He 's full of poison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made and packed , I heard Father say , " You ca n't take your eyes off these people for a minute . " Mother said , " That 's just what Polski used to say . " " Do n't compare me to that turkey . " " You 're getting shrill , Allie . " " Poison , " Father said . " Hydrogen and enriched ammonia thirty cubic feet of each one . You 'd be shrill too , if you knew the danger . " " I 'll get the food , " Mother said , and walked away . Father saw me listening . " I 'm the only one around here carrying the ball . Why is that , Charlie ? You tell me . " I thought , He really does sound like Polski . We left for Seville  --  the Fox family , no one else . Father pedaled and talked the whole time . " Do n't think I 'm enjoying this , " he said . " The last thing I want to do is go back to Seville . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we 're obliged . We ca n't drop them after one shipment . I thought we might inspire them , help them out , cool their fish and give them time for farming  --  do all the things that ice lets you do . That 's the whole point , is n't it ? Give them the benefit of our experience ? But I know what they 'll do with the ice  --  they 'll cube it and dump it into their glasses of Coke and just go haywire like everyone else . " " You did n't say anything about Coca-Cola , " Mother said . " Give them time . " We made Seville in under three hours , Father pedaling furiously and shouting about how he was going to dynamite a canal through the jungle and dredge the hyacinths out of the river . In his angry mood he imagined the grandest schemes . At the mahoganies we were met by five Seville people  --  they popped out of the spinach and the grass and startled us . They had seen us on the river , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danced around Mother , telling her to be careful . " We did n't get a reception like this the last time , " Father said . " I think they want us to follow them , " Mother said . As before , I ran ahead , stamping on the duckboards to frighten away the snakes . Jerry was behind me , looking worriedly from side to side . He said , " What 's that thing ? "  | " It was n't here before , " Clover said . It was a wooden box in the clearing of Seville , as tall as me , and from a distance it looked like Fat Boy . It was smaller , somewhat resemblingthe original Worm Tub . It had a chimney stack and a firebox . Several women squatted near it , stoking its fire . This pleased Father . " Maybe we inspired them after all , " he said . He called out to the Gowdy , who was waiting to greet us . " What have you got there ? " Father said . " That looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it while the Seville people gathered around . The Gowdy said , " Hice ! " Father opened the door , but the hinges of tattered vine were so flimsy the door fell off and the corner of it caught fire when it banged the firebox . Father kicked the fire out . We looked inside . It was empty . " What the hell is this all about ? " Father said . They had made a copy of Fat Boy . But , Father said , what good was it ? Of course it did n't work . It was only good for boiling eggs or setting yourself on fire . " Who gave you this harebrained idea ? " They smiled . They treated this box with a kind of reverence and asked Father to lead them in hymns in front of it . This enraged Father . He began to smell of his anger . The Gowdy tried to present Fatherwith the lame puppy , but Father said he had enough sick animalsof his own , and sick people too . So we unloaded the ice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Icicle . He said to Mother , " I hope you 're satisfied . " He also said he would never again go to Seville . " I did n't come here to give people false idols to worship , " he said . But the idol was there for all to see , made of warped planks and fastenedby lianas . " That 's the trouble , really , " Father said . " Any sufficiently advancedtechnology is indistinguishable from magic . "  | " WHAT 'S ice good for ? " little Leon Maywit had asked . But Father did not mind silly questions from small children . He went on , " Mainly it 's a preservative  --  it keeps food fresh , so it keeps you from starvation and disease . It kills germs , it suppresses pain , and it brings down swellings . It makes everything it touches taste better without altering it chemically . Makes vegetables crisp and meat last forever . Listen , it 's an anesthetic . I could remove your appendix with a jackknife if I had a block of ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butchery . It does n't occur naturally on the MosquitoCoast , so it 's the beginning of perfection in an imperfect world . It makes sense of work . It 's free . It 's even pretty . It 's civilization . It used to be carried from northern latitudes on ships in just the same way they carried gold and spices  --  " We were on the Gallery , all of us , Foxes , Maywits , Zambus , Mrs. Flora Kennywick , and the others  --  one of Father 's dinner gatherings . Father pointed his finger stump at the mountains rising behind Fat Boy . He said , " And that 's next . Injun country . We 'll take them a ton . " The newer people looked at his finger , not the mountains , and justas he said " ton , " there was an earth tremor and their eyes popped . It was a noiseless wobble , a slow half-roll that made the Galleryquiver . It was twenty seconds of rotation , like the drop of a boatdeck . Nothing fell down , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bark of worry from the river . I had the feelingthat everything had moved but us . The world 's peel had wrinkledp195and made a little skid . That was the first shuddering stall , but its variousshakes and smoothings lasted a full minute . Father made a flutterblast with his lips and said , " Gaw ! " Mrs. Maywit said , " Oh , God , Roper , what we do ? " and she and Mrs. Kennywick began praying . When I heard " Roper , " I looked at Mr. Maywit . He covered his face and sobbed , " Never mind ! " The moment passed . I think I was the only one who heard . " Pray if you must , " Father said , " but I 'd rather you listened to me . " Everyone except us looked worried , as if he might point again at the mountains and cause another earthquake . " I 'm just thinking out loud , " Father said , " but if I had the hardware , know what I 'd do ? " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking  --  why do anything ? It was plain from where we sat that Jeronimo was a success . We had defeated the mosquitoes , tamed the river , drained the swamp , and irrigated the gardens . We had seen the worst of Honduras weather  --  the June floods , the September heat  --  and we had overcomeboth . We had just this moment withstood an earth tremor : nothing had shaken loose ! We were organized , Father said . Our drinking water was purified in a distiller that ran from Fat Boy 's firebox . We had the only ice-making plant in Mosquitia , the only one of its kind in the world , and the capability , Father said , of makingan iceberg . Down there were cornstalks , eight-and-a-half feet high , with cobs a foot long  --  " So big , it only takes eleven of them to make a dozen . " We had fresh fruit and vegetables and an incubator ( Fat Boy 's spare heat ) for hatching eggs . " Control  --  that 's the proof of civilization . Anyone can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that 's the true test . " We grew rice , the most difficultof crops . We had a superior sewage system and shower apparatus . " We 're clean ! " An efficient windmill pump overrode the water wheel on the ice-making days . Most of the inventions had been made from local materials , and three new buildings were faced with Father 's bamboo tiles . We had a chicken run and two boats at the landing and the best flush toilets in Honduras . Jeronimo was a masterpieceof order  --  " appropriate technology , " Father called it.  |p196We  produced more than we needed . The extra fish we caught swam in a tank Father named " the Fish Farm "  --  his names were always a little grander than the things themselves . We harvested more than we could eat , but the excess was not sold . Some of it he gave to people in return for work , though he never handed out any food to beggars . What he preferred to do was cut the produce open  --  watermelons , say , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry them . He would give these to anyone who helped him . There was always work to do  --  he was determined to straighten the river and clear it of hyacinths , for instance . " It could take a lifetime , " he said . " But I 've got a lifetime ! I 'm not going anywhere ! " River workers were rewarded with blocks of ice and bags of seeds . " Hybrids ! Burpees ! Wonder corn ! Miracle beans ! Sixty-day tomatoes ! " We were happy and hidden . All you could see of Jeronimo from the river was Fat Boy 's square head and tin hat and the smoking chimney stack . " Low visibility , " Father said . " I do n't want to be pestered by goofball missionaries in motorboats who want to come up here and ooze Scripture all over us . " It was now November , the weather like Hatfield in July , and Jeronimo was home . And for this , Father said , no one had said a prayer or surrendered his soul or pledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had not polluted the river . We had preservedthe ecology of the Mosquito Coast . And all because we had put our trust in " a Yankee with a knack for getting things accomplished "  --  him . He often said that if it were not for white-collar crime and stupidity and a twenty-cent dollar and the storm clouds of war , he could have done the same things in Hatfield , Massachusetts . All this was plain from the Gallery , which had just wobbled with the earth tremor , and where Father was saying , " If I had the hardware , know what I 'd do ? " The others were still fearfully gray and did not reply . Mother said , " What would you do , Allie ? " " Sink a shaft . " He singled out the Maywits and Mrs. Kennywick and talked to them , because they had been praying hardest and were in a way still quaking themselves . " The kind of hole they make in the Santa Barbara Channel or the North Sea . Your diamond bits , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down  --  what ?  --  four or five thousand feet and tap the energy resources right under here . " He stamped his foot on the Gallery floor . " Just the way your chicleros tap a sapodilla tree . Same principle . " " You make me a sweet li'l raincap , Fadder , " Mrs. Kennywick said . But her voice told that she was still thinking of the earth tremor . " The rumble reminded me . Why does n't anyone else put two and two together ? See , the mistake they make in drilling for oil is that they 're missing a golden opportunity . They 've got all the hardware , but as soon as the oil starts gushing they pump it dry and bore another one . Talk about foolish and short-sighted ! " " But Fadder ai n't do that foolishness , " Mr. Maywit said to Mother , as if he knew what was coming . He looked fearful , or perhapshe just seemed so to me because I knew his real name was Roper . " I 'd let it gush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go past the shale , lengthen the bit , go past the granite  --  lengthen it some more  --  and penetrate the bowels of the earth . " " Shoo , " Mr. Haddy said . " That is a spearmint for true . " " That earth tremor we just had was a geological crepitation , a subterranean fart , from the bowels of the earth . There 's gas down there ! Superheated water , steam under pressure  --  all the heat you need ! " Mr. Peaselee said , " Ai n't we hot enough now , Fadder ? " And Mr. Harkins said it was so hot it was bringing out the crapsies , though I I had no idea what he meant by this . " Dad 's not talking about the weather , " Clover said . " Listen to that little girl , " Father said . Everyone looked at Clover . She basked for a while under their watery eyes . " Geothermal energy ! Do n't laugh . There 's only a few places in the world where it 's practical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The whole of Central America is a repository of high energy . You 're on a fault line  --  thin crust , loose plates  --  listen to the volcanoes . They 're calling out and saying , Geothermal ! Geothermal ! '  --  but no one 's doing anything about it . No one seems to understand how the modern world got this way  --  no one except me , and I understand it because I had a hand in making it . Everyone elsep198is running away , or pursuing wasteful and dirty technology , or sayinghis prayers . " " We ai n't praying no more , " Mrs. Kennywick said . " The promised land is in your own back yard ! All you have to do is get through that flowerbed , and drill the crust and tap the heat . We 've been on the moon , but we have n't been in our own basement boiler . Listen , there 's enough energy down there to do our cooking until kingdom come ! " I had to grin . Only Father would think of cooking by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost a nickel , " was his usual boast , " and think of the benefits  --  a great invention is a perpetual annuity . " Father was excited by the earth tremor and his idea , and he infectedthe others on the Gallery with his excitement and optimism  --  just those feelings alone , because I was sure they had not understood a word he said . " I see a kind of conduit , a borehole , " he said . " Down go the drills , up comes the heat energy . I 've already proved I can make ice out of nothing but pipefittings and chemical compounds and a little kindling wood . That took brains . But listen , any dumbbell can dig a hole . Why do n't we ? There 's a good reason  --  we have n't got the hardware . Not yet . There 's certain things in this world you ca n't make out of bamboo and chicken wire . But I 'll tell you something else . Siphoning off the geothermal energy  --  I mean , in a huge way  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least take some of the kick out of them . See , I am talking about nothing less than harnessing a volcano ! " He had them twitching with this-speech , and they looked eager enough to snatch shovels and start digging wherever he pointed . All except Mr. Haddy . He stood up and cleared his throat and said , " That is a good spearmint , but it take an awful lot of brains . Between times , Lungley and me want to ship some ice down Bonito and Fish Bucket . " " Still dying to impress your friends , are n't you ? " " Ai n't got friends down there , " Mr. Haddy said . " But I can use me lanch like the old-time days , loading and sailing . That is my occupation , Fadder . " " I take it you 're not interested in geothermal energy . " " Interested , sure thing , for true . But that spearmint , man , is real large . We ai n't got all them holes and poles ! "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his teeth out and blinked like a rabbit . " How much ice do you want to take downstream ? " " Coupla hundred pounds . Two-three sacks . " " Hardly worth the trouble , " Father said . " Why not take a ton ? " Mr. Haddy laughed loudly in surprise and relief . " She sink me old lanch ! " " Ice floats , Figgy "  --  Mr. Haddy smiled at the word  --  " You can tow it . " " How we do that ? " " Take an iceberg . " " Icebugs and bowl-caynoes , " Mr. Maywit said to me , but clear enough for Father to hear . " Fadder sure is a miracle man ! " - Mr . Maywit looked very frightened . " We could make an iceberg before breakfast , " Father said . It was the sort of challenge Father enjoyed , something grand andvisible  --  a task that was also a performance . He had objected toMr . Haddy taking a few sacks of ice to the coast , but towing an iceberg  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its sides submerged , its point sticking up , being tugged by Little Haddy . But Father 's iceberg was eggshaped , and as tall as he was , to concentrate its coldness and limit its melting . He calculated that a single block made from many smaller blocks would be reduced by only a third if they floated it to Bonito Oriental , and it would still look like an iceberg in Fish Bucket . It would not make the coast . " But we 're just proving a point here  --  not trying to change anyone 's life . We 'll see how it shakes down . " He told Mother it was mainly a morale-builder . " I like it when you get an idea and no one laughs . They deserve an iceberg . " Mr. Haddy was very proud . The iceberg was his boast , and he would captain the Creoles in taking it downstream . " I 'm just obeying orders , " Father said . " If Figgy wants an iceberg , he 's going to have it . " All work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the pumps primed . We had been keeping Fat Boy purring , but we onlyp200removed ice when we needed it for the cold-storage room , where we kept dead hens and vegetables . " We 're a thoroughly refrigerated settlement , " Father said . But the truth was that ice was not a necessityso far . It was a novelty , like Father 's idea of geothermal energy . Why drill five thousand feet down to get at a volcano 's bowels ? To provide Fat Boy with an endless heat supply . One scheme justified another . We could have done without them , but , as Father said , why live like savages ? " In the end , Robinson Crusoe went back home ! But we 're staying . " He said , " Someday , there 'll be a conduit here , self-sealing and perpetual , and this whole refrigeration plant will be operated by geothermal energy . We 'll have ice coming out of our ears and wo n't have to chop another stick of wood . Think of the future ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumped water into Fat Boy and kept the firebox full and listened to the fizz and bubble in the pipes . Father ran back and forth on the path to the riverbank , where the ice bricks were taking shape as an oval iceberg . " It 's pretty and it 's free . You find me a better combination of virtues . " Every half-hour we froze a new batch of bricks , and by mid-day we were finished  --  a large blue-white iceberg lay steaming and sweating in the mud , with a tow rope frozen in its center . It was roughly the shape of a Volkswagen Beetle , but larger , on a platform of bamboo logs that served first as a sled and then as a raft . We had no difficulty launching it . The tow rope was hitched to Little Haddy , and its gunning engine got the ice down the bank and into the river . The Creoles  --  Harkins , Peaselee , and Maywit  --  were in the bow , and Mr. Haddy in the wheel house , the ice creaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around it . Of all the strange pieces of anything that floated down this jungle river , this was the strangest by a country mile . " Our message to the world , " Father said . " I 'd love to see their faces when it heaves into view  --  coming out of the hottest , sickest , most parched and bug-ridden jungle in the whole hemisphere . They look up from their laundry . What is dat ? " Dat is a icebug , Mudder , and he heading dis way ! ' " Mother said , " They 'll think it 's the end of the world . " " But it 's the beginning . It 's creation , Mother . " The iceberg , hog-backed and bobbing , went around the bend andp201out of sight . The children ran down the Swampmouth path to get another look . Mother headed into the house , and then I was alone with Father on the riverbank . " I could have gone with them , " he said . " But I did n't want to spoil their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked back at Fat Boy . " Besides , I 've got to see to him . He might have overheated . He 's full of poison and flammable gas . Ammonia and hydrogen , Charlie  --  those are his vital juices ! " He looked at his finger stump and added , " But there 's danger in all great inventions . " I saw my chance to tell him about the Acre . There was no danger there , apart from the traps we had set . We had food and water and shelter . But I was afraid of what he might say about the praying tree and the lean-to school . He might have got me to admit that we had taken all our clothes off one day and compared tools . He would have been stinking angry , or else hooting and calling us savages . So I said nothing . " You feel a little like God , " he whispered , looking around . His clothes were soaked from the ice bricks and sweat . His fingers were red from handling the ice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He turned his bloodshot eyes on me and went on in the same tired and wondering whisper , " God had fun making things like icebergs and volcanoes . Too bad He did n't finish the job . Ha ! " Little Haddy returned to Jeronimo at nightfall . Mr. Haddy was gigglingwith pride , but at last he confessed that the iceberg had started breaking up at Bonito Oriental . They had cut it loose and let the current take the fragments downstream to the coast . He was a little drunk , because at the Chinese store in Bonito they had traded some ice for a calabash of mishla . But Father was smiling at the river , maybe imagining the ice bricks floating down to Santa Rosa , and people pointing and fishing them out and struck with terror at the thought of ice sailing out of the jungle . " This was a field day , " he said . It had not cost anything , and we were all happier as a result . He told us he had left the United States so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puttingp202our ideas into practice . It was what he had always dreamed about . Outside the Gallery that night , the birds fell silent in the muddy twilight and the bats began chirping . Around us was a circular wall of insect howl . A light breeze quickened in the darkness , brushing the trees . We played Up Jenkins on the Gallery floor , to the flashes of heat lightning that separated the mountains from the night sky . " That 's next . Injun country . We 'll take them a ton . " But when he pointed , the Creoles and Zambus held tight to the Gallery rails , expecting another earth tremor . And Mr. Haddy , being worried , was all the more rabbit-toothed . Father did not notice them . He was staring at the mountains , waiting for another lightning bolt . It came . It flashed on his face . " You feel a little like God , " he said.  |p203IN  THE DAYTIME , Jeronimo was ours  --  our design , our gardens , the whops and claps of our pumps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mechanics . It was hot , but the heat and light burned it clean of stinks . And it was always in the daytime that Father said , " I declare this a success . " The coldest Jeronimo got was in the hour before dawn , like right now , when it was coal-black and clammy and so silent in the clearingyou could hear the trees drip . It was foreign and all wild . The jungle odors were strongest , too , the wet itch of hairy vines , the wormy tree trunks , the foul smack of sappy leaves , and the river rotting as it swept past us . These were the stinks and perfumes of early morning , dew-soaked grass , and wet petals , and they overwhelmed the civilized smells of Jeronimo . Everything was black under the black sky . The stars , which at midnight looked like a spillway of broken pearls , did not shine at this hour  --  they were holes of light , like eye squints in black masks . Father had woken Jerry and me and told us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready , " he said . We waited in the dark , standing in the wet grass near Fat Boy 's firebox , yawning and shivering . " I 've been up for hours getting this together , " Father said . I could see the glow of his cigar butt , nothing else . " Hardly slept a wink . " " Fadder ai n't need no sleep , " Mr. Maywit said . So Father had been lecturing him , too.  |p204As  my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness , I saw Mr. Maywit fussing around a block of ice . It was nearly as big as the iceberg Mr. Haddy had towed downstream two days ago . Something in Mr. Maywit 's jittery gestures said he was not coming with us . He was working too hard , out of breath and chattering to Mr. Peaselee , as if he was impatient for us to leave , sort of showing us the door . The slab of ice  --  it looked like a fat lump of lard in the darkness  --  was being wrapped in a mitten of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sled had a pair of close-set runners and was rigged to be pulled by men in harnesses . " Do n't talk to me about wheels , " Father said . But no one had said anything about wheels . Rustling the banana leaves as they layered them over the ice block , Mr. Maywit and Mr. Peaselee were whispering between themselves . Father 's cigar butt blazed . " Wheels are for paved roads  --  they wo n't get you anywhere on these mountain tracks . Too inefficient . Just break or get bogged down in the gumbo . But Skidder here "  --  it was his name for the ice sled  --  " will merely glide over the bumps . " The ice no longer glowed like lard . The wrapping was done . It looked like granite , the hump of a tombstone . Mr. Maywit and Mr. Peaselee stepped aside , their white eyes wide open . " How about it ? " Father said . " Are you coming with us ? " " Kyant . " Mr. Maywit was hesitant and backpedaling . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He almost forgot ! " he cried . " If you 're Field Super , you get those gutters scrubbed . I want them so clean I can eat off them . Where are you , Mr. P. ? " Mr. Peaselee said , " Fadder ? " from a squatting position , and sprang to his feet , muttering . " You coming ? " " No man , " Mr. Peaselee said . " They always troubles there . Contrabanders . Shouljers . Feefs . People from Nicaragua way . Up in those mountains , they got ruckboos , for true . " " Quit it  --  you do n't know the first thing about trouble . " Father turned his back on the Creoles . " Where 's my jungle men , where 's my trackers ? " " Hee , Fadder . " It was a low brown growl , close by . The Zambus had been there beside us like black trees , listening the whole time  --  Francis Lung/ley , John Dixon , and Bucky Smart . Now I could see their round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Harness up and let 's shove off , " Father said . " Go back to bed , Peasie . Get your beauty sleep . " We started out of the clearing , Father in front , the Zambus pulling the sled , Jerry and me following behind . Father was still talking . " Trouble , the man says . I do n't call a forty-five  --  degree angle trouble , and what 's a handful of no-goods ? I could have that halfbreedpleading for mercy . Fuel shortages , unemployment , moral sneaks in Washington , and muggers on every street corner ! Kids in grade school sniffing glue , polecats in every pulpit , old-lady hoarders , white-collar punks , double-figure inflation , and a twodollarloaf of bread . That 's what I call trouble . Dead rivers , cities that look like Calcutta  --  that 's trouble for fair . You do n't take a walk because you 're afraid of getting a shiv in your ribs , so you stay home and they come through the windows . There are homicidal maniacs , ten years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole country 's bleeding to death  --  bleeding  --  " He kept on talking as we entered the dark path out of Jeronimo , and the birds flew up at the sound of his voice . " Our technological future 's in the tiny hands of the Nipponese , and we let coolies do our manufacturing for us . And what about those jumped-up camel drivers frantically doubling the price of oil every two weeks ? Did I hear someone mention trouble ? " The ferny boughs blocked the stars overhead , and the path was so narrow the wet leaves brushed dew against our arms . In the daytime this track was a green tunnel , but at night it was the throat of a cave . Father went on talking about the United States . " It makes me mad , " he was saying . We followed his voice and the creaking sled . Very soon we were climbing , and within a short time Jerry told me his legs were tired . Mine were trembling from this new effort of climbing , and my feet were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a spackoid and a sissy  --  it was what Father would have said  --  and I felt stronger . The path zigzagged through dim pickets of trees . We had never been here before . On the tight corners , the Zambus called out , " Hoop ! Hoop ! Hoop ! " and turned the sled . Father had been right  --  wheels would have been useless here . The loose boulders and soft dirt would have jammed them . And Jerry and I were lucky . The sled moved so slowly on these bends that we could pause and get ourp206breath . The sled 's runners made deep ruts , and on the steeper parts of the track we could hear the Zambus ' whispered grunts . " Not to mention the Russians , " Father was saying . Dawn was breaking  --  lifting the sky and uncovering the trees behind us . It did not seem so jungly now , except that in the grayness just before the sunrise cracked against the treetops , there came the whistle-screech of birds and the hurrying of perhaps snakes or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyhow , beside the path . In the dark , I had felt I was burrowing , but sunup brought greenness to the path and made me feel tiny on the thinly wooded slope . Jerry and I had fallen back . When we caught up with the sled , we saw that Father and the Zambus had stopped and were looking down the valley . " But there 's no trouble there , " Father said . We were above Jeronimo and could see its bamboo roofs , the columns of woodsmoke mingled with the mist , and mattresses of morning fog lying in the fields . The sunlight that was full against this high slope where we stood had not reached Jeronimo . But its pattern was clear , even in the broth of mist . Its stone paths were laid out among the gardens like a star outlined on a patched flag . It looked wonderful from here , neither a town nor a farm but a settlementof precisely placed buildings on the river that was a twisted blue vein in the muscle of jungle . At greater distances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They just got out of bed , " Father said , seeing the people stirring in Jeronimo . " There 's someone going for a whizz  --  probably Figgy . " I could see Mr. Haddy 's flour-sack shirt . " Lulled into a false sense of security , " Father said . " I blame myself . Contrabanders  --  feefs . ' Of course Mr. Peaselee wants to go back to bed . He knows he 's in Happy Valley ! " Jerry said , " There 's Mrs. Kennywick . " She was moving heavily toward the chicken run . " Feed them chickens , shuck that corn , " Father said . Fat Boy was a bright-lidded tower , its reflectors catching the sun 's first rays in its tin dimples . It looked like nothing else for miles  --  marvelous in a valley that was itself full of marvels . " Mudda , " Francis said , and pinched his fingers at the smallness of Mother hanging clothes on the line.  | " She 's all business . " Father slapped my back with pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She took things easy and alwaysasked us if we were hungry or tired , or if there was anything we wanted . It was through Mother 's encouragement that we roamed the forest and made our jungle camp at the Acre . Father treated us like adults , which meant he put us to work . But we were children  --  homesick half the time and afraid of the dark and not very strong . Mother knew that . It was Father who , in what you would have expected to be a coconut kingdom of sunshine and lazy days , was alwaysroostering around and crowing for us to get down to business . It was going to be an all-day trip today , and I knew that with Mother it would have been different . Father might say things like " I 'm working for you " and " Tell me what to do , " but he was in charge . He had made Jeronimo succeed  --  it was all his doing  --  and he knew it . Yet at times like this I wished that Mother was here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We would have talked to her about the hopes we carried on our backs like parachutes . With Father , we listened and sweated . " It 's another mile up this crooked path , at a loose guess , " Father said , looking up the hill . " We 'll keep dragging this old Skidder . Once we get up there , it 's all downhill . " He was pointing ahead to what looked like a mountaintop . It was a dome we could see from Jeronimo . An hour later , when we reached it , we saw that it was not a mountaintop at all , but the hip of just another slope . This mountainside seemed to go on and on . Jerry said , " I want to rest . Will you wait for me , Charlie ? " " Dad wo n't like it . We ca n't sit down while they 're doing all the hard work . " Jerry was hot-faced and blush-blotched and damp from the heat . His hands were dirty and his skinny legs were clawed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him I would run ahead and ask Father . I felt sorry for Jerry , but I wanted a rest too . " Jerry wants to stop , " I said . " He 's tired . " " He says he 's tired . " Father kept on walking . He called to the Zambus . " We 'll have lunch on top . Then we 'll have a lovely postprandial glissade behind this baffle and sock this frozen monolith into that benighted wilderness . " Francis Lungley grunted.  |p208Father  winked at me . " You 've got to talk their language . " But where was the top ? These summits were as false as the ones beneath . They showed nothing but other summits beyond . Looking back , we could see the succession of crooked slopes that had appeared to us to be mountaintops until we scaled them . We had climbed the mountain 's bum only to see , miles away , its sunlit shoulders . " After this , it 'll be all downhill , " Father said , on the steepest parts . The ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragged . Though I could not see them , I could hear the Zambus gasping . Their gasps were regular and harsh , like the scrape of a bucksaw in a log . We were used to the damp shade of our own trees , the buggy riverside , the flat gardens and cool hollows of Jeronimo . Up here , the trees were thin and burned dry by the sun , the slopes were rocky , there was no shade or shelter . We heard dogs bark and now and then we smelled smoke . But we saw no people . Father was still talking , still promising us lunch and predicting that soon it would be all downhill . Pretty soon , Jerry and I were walking in mud . Water was shaking out of the bamboo sled and drizzling onto the ground . The ice was melting fast  --  the lower portion of the banana-leaf mitten , all that insulation , was blackened with moisture . The angle of the track was so sharp that the ice sled was not pulled steadily but jerked , and water flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Jerry from behind the sled . The Zambus were bent double in their harnesses . They gasped in their wood-sawing way , and their chins dripped with sweat and their faces were twisted horribly . Crouched like this , struggling forward practically on their knees , they no longer looked like men . They had been turned into suffering animals by this hard pulling , with dog faces and bruised thumbs . Their nostrils were wide open and their eyes buried in squints . They looked so frightening with froth on their necks , we did not dare tell them the ice was melting . And we knew that if we told Father he would go into fits . It was well past lunchtime . Father had hurried on to get a glimpse of what lay ahead . When he came back and said " Let 's break for lunch , " we guessed that we were near the top of the mountain . Jerry and I were carrying the lunch in our knapsacks . We spreadp209it on a rock  --  tomato sandwiches , boiled corn , guavas , bananas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moreuseful a cable car would be on this tortuous path . " Project a series of tripods , bearing a cable for slinging passengers and cargo up and down the mountain , " he said . " It would be no more trouble to build than a ski lift . " And while the Zambus were panting and Jerry whimpering over his sore feet , Father cantered around the slope saying , " Section it that 's the way . Hoist some pylons here and get pulleys working . Your trolley simply swings up and over these little cliffs . If you had a system of finely meshed cogs , you could work it manually above or below , or counterbalance it on an opposing line and make it selfoperating . Then your descending weight would hoist your hopper to the summit . That 's not ordinary rock you 're wearing out shoe leather on  --  that 's potential ballast . Oh , Gaw ! " He had jogged over to the sled to admire its size , but he had seen that the ice was melting . " We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you say something ? Come on , let 's move out before it all goes to pieces . " And he ran ahead saying , " We should have put a rubber sock around it ! " The Zambus sighed , and harnessed themselves again . By mid-afternoon we still had not reached the ridge . But Father shouted so much , the Zambus stumbled . And they tried so hard to please him , they rushed the sled into a boulder that punched it apart . With a grunt that was almost human , the block of ice cracked in half , splitting its mitten of leaves and fracturing the sled . " That 's wonderful , " Father said quietly . " That is just what I need . Thank you very much , gentlemen . Now , do n't mind me . I 'm just going to take a walk around the block . You stay here , and if you 're inclined to pick up the pieces , I promise you I wo n't stand in your way . " He gave us all a weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him scream from behind a rock . Francis Lungley looked at me in alarm . " He 's mad , " I said . " You 'd better fix this . " The Zambus cut the ice free and , grumbling among themselves , made two sleds . It was almost an hour before we could set off again , but now Father and Bucky were harnessed to one sled , and Francis and John manned the other . This was worse than before , for Fatherp210was angry , growling at his work , straining and yelling . The broken ice had melted smaller , the two teams moved fast along the track . But we were no nearer to the ridge . Jerry and I scampered ahead , listening to the men breathing hard beneath us . The next rise brought us to a bowl in the mountainside that was filled with white flowers and bees . The track , descending fob ' the first time ( but it rose again on the other side ) , gave Father and the Zambus a chance to take it easy . When they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and necks are filthy . What 's the matter with you kids ? Ca n't you keep clean ? " We explained that we had rubbed black berry juice on our skin to keep the flies and bees away . It was the trick Alice Maywit had shown us at the Acre . The berry juice was as good as insect repellent . The Zambus had used it too , only it was impossible to see the dark juice on their black skin . Father had been bitten  --  his wrists and neck were pebbly from insect bites . I thought he might thank us for this information . It was natural medication , it worked , and it was free . But he hated the look of it . He said , " You think I 'm scared of a few bug bites ? Ha ! If you 're scared of bugs , you 've got no business here . " The bees swarmed around him as he spoke . He batted them away . " They know when you 're scared ! They can smell fear ! " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His ear lobe swelled fat and shook like a turkey 's wattle . He said he could not feel a thing . The sun was ahead of us , dropping behind the mountain we were climbing . It dazzled us , but it had lost most of its heat . I wondered what would happen when it sank , because in all the time we had lived in Jeronimo  --  almost seven months now  --  we had always returned home at sundown . But we had not reached the village . Jeronimo was hours behind us . Father and the Zambus were still grunting in their harnesses , dragging the two sleds . I said , " We 'll have to go home in the dark . " " We ca n't go home until we deliver this ice ! " Deliver it where ? I looked at the cargo on the sleds . The bananaleafinsulation fit loosely , like a man 's clothes on a child . There was not much ice left . " Why did n't I think to put a rubber sock around it ? Those two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the sun was half gone , a segment of cold fruit , and Father'sface brassy bright in its last glare . He urged the Zambus on , as i f chasing the sun to the summit . But the sunset was quicker , and while they heaved the sleds along the track , the sun slice blinked behind the rocks , and its afterglow was a dusty pinkness in the sky . Father 's determination left him then . He stepped out of his harnessand walked up the path to snarl at the dying daylight . " All right , " he said , " we 'll make camp . " " Where will we sleep ? " Jerry asked . " Why , just over there , across the street , in the Holiday Inn ! You two kids can lounge by the poolside while I fix us up with a couple of rooms . Want a king-sized bed ? I know I do , and I sure hope they 've got air conditioning and color TV  --  " He was walking in circles and biting a new cigar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeseburgers , and a funny-bunny piano player in the cocktail bar . Want a roll of quarters for the juke box , Jerry ? Play some tunes ? " Jerry had begun to cry . He had knelt down to tighten one of his sandals and , crouching there , put his head against his knee and sobbed quietly . I pitied Jerry . All he had asked was where we were going to sleep , but Father went on mocking him with this speech about the Holiday Inn and have a nice hot shower bath and good long rest . " There goes Charlie , off to buy a Fudgsicle . Careful crossing the road , sonny ! " I knew Father was disappointed that we had not made it to the Indian village , so instead of sulking or crying , like Jerry , I had decided to do something helpful . I said , " I 'm looking for some wood to build a lean-to . " " Hear that , Fido ? He 's going to show us how to make camp . Like he showed us how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand it to these kids . " " Charlie know how , " Francis said . " He 's a hamburger , " Father said . " He 's got your number . " It was clear that Father had not planned to camp out . We had eaten most of the food . We had no tents or mosquito nets , no lanternsor blankets , and only one mess kit . The water bag was almost empty . But there were several things in our favor  --  it was the dry season , so we would not get rained on , and there were fewer insectsp212up here , and all day we had seen pacas and birds on the mountainside  --  we could eat those . Father had traveled light in the hope of rushing the mountain , but we had failed , and now it was everting : " Do n't just stand there , " Father shouted to the Zambus . " Impro-vise ! " The Zambus built a fire , while Jerry and I made a lean-to out of sticks we had found nearby . Then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to disturb Father , who was cursing , hacking at a sapling with his knife . He was no good at making temporary camps , and he was surprised at how quickly and well Jerry and I put up our lean-to . It did not need to be waterproof  --  it was only to protect us from the wind , which was strengthening up here as darkness fell . When Father saw our bed-nest of grass he said , " You planning to lay an egg ? " He cut five saplings , saying , " I 'm going to make a proper shelter ! " He started to lash them together , but before his first frame was completeit was pitch dark , which was a shame because his shelter would have been much better than ours if he had finished it . At last , he kicked it apart and said , " What 's the use ! " Seeing me with some yautia plants , he said , " Picking flowers , Charlie ? That 's the idea  --  you can put them into your scrapbook . Wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were yautias and that their roots were as tasty as carrots . " Eddoes , " Bucky said . Eddo was his name for yautia . He had speared a paca rat with a sharpened stick and was roasting it over the fire with the same spear . " I 'm not hungry , " Father said . " Anyway , I do n't eat rats and weeds . " He watched us eat and he told us how , traveling in Eastern Europe , he had been disgusted to find that everywhere he ate , the silverwarewas dirty . He had smeary knives , and stains on his spoon , and the tines of the fork always had bits of yesterday 's food between them . At another place , he had found a hair in his milk . He went on describing the filthy silverware , and he made the Zambus laugh , but I kept thinking how strange it was that we were squatting here on this mountainside in Honduras , eating a burned paca and burned yautia with our fingers , while Father complained about the dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food at all , and he said it was indecent to praise it while you were eating it . But thatp213night on the mountain , all he talked about were the tormenting meals he had eaten and the cutlery that had not been washed properly . Finally he said , " You 're melting my ice , " and ordered us to put the fire out . The Zambus obeyed . They had made their beds beside low windbreaksof boughs . They were not the men I was used to in Jeronimo . I Jere , on the mountainside , they had become silent and simpler and a little wild-seeming . " I 'm not tired , " Father said , as Jerry and I crawled into our leanto . " I 'll just sit here and cool my heels until you 're ready to move out . " He sat cross-legged near the ice . He had combined the two blocks to concentrate their cold . I could tell from the hot glow of his cigar that he was sulking  --  maybe thinking about dirty cutlery . But I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned us not to touch it . The Zambus muttered for a while , and then they sighed and lay like logs on the ground . " I wish Ma was here , " Jerry said , but he was soon asleep . The wind hummed in the bushes and dragged against the rocks and dry grass . That was the only sound , the wind , but later I heard another noise in this humming of wind . It was a plink-plink-plink , as if someone were striking the highest key on an old piano . It was the ice melting , waterdrops hitting the tin pan of the mess kit . I was painfully hungry and still thirsty , and the sound of water made me thirstier . I poked my head out of the lean-to and saw Father beyond the dead fire , sitting in front of the ice block . The block with is clumsy cover was about a quarter of its morning size , but silhouetted in the starry sky it still looked like a tombstone , and Father like a white corpse that had crawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a skull 's and gave him bony arms . " I want to sleep in my own bed ! " he screamed . I tried to think of something to say . I decided , after all , not to ask him for any water . " What are you looking at ? " he said fiercely . " This is the first time since creation that ice has ever melted here . Think of it ! And you 're saying that 's nothing ? "  |p214I  WOKE UP tired in damp clothes and remembered we were still on the mountain  --  Father , Zambus , and ice . Father had fallen on his side and , slap on the ground , had gone to sleep with his arms folded and his baseball hat squashed against his cheek . But he woke quickly and denied that he had even dozed off . He said he had got bored , watching us snore . He said , " No , we have n't failed ! " and told me to fill the canvas bag with the water that had dripped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harnessed . " He was peeking under the cover of the ice block . He shoved the cakes of ice into the knapsacks . Each cake was about the size of a football , speckled with brown broken leaf , and had the rotten texture of a hard sponge . This was all that was left of the great ice block we had dragged out of Jeronimo . " Do n't say anything . Do n't ask me any questions . I do n't want to hear a peep out of anyone . Now let 's march ! " He sprinted up the path , his knapsack rising and falling , bumping his back , whop-whop . Francis Lungley followed behind with the other knapsack , then Bucky and John , empty-handed , and Jerry and I , trying our best to keep up . I carried the long water bag . It slapped against my knees and prevented me from running . It was a bright cool dawn , washed in light , with parcels of cloud lying against the mountainside like ghosts of dead mackerel . Up ahead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he was waiting for us , but I saw that he had reached another ridge of the mountain . It was the last ridge . Below us  --  but it was a plateau , not the deep valley we had expected  --  was all of Honduras.  |p215Such  an empty world . I did not think wilderness could look so sad . This was a different country from the one we knew : limitless jungle , volcanoes , and no ocean . No rivers that we could see , no water at all . It was a surface of treetops and skimming birds . Its vastness made me feel small and puny . No smoke , no roads , nothing to say that people lived here . It was Olancho , but that was only a name . It was anybody 's . " It looks so desolate , " I said . " You 've never seen Chicago ! " The treetops beneath us continued to the horizon , and the unbrokengreenness gave it such a strong suggestion of depth that it hardly looked like forest at all . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so high it had risen to the mountain range . Father was smiling at it all , and yet it was Father who had told us that the deepest tides tricked you with their flatness  --  if you stuck your foot in them , they would drag you out and drown you in their undertow . " It 's all downhill from now on . " There was no path . Father set off , running beside the trickle of a stony creek . The Zambus said we were to look out for more bees . The Indians here were beekeepers and always had hives near their huts . And dogs  --  half-wild ones  --  they kept those , too . But we smelled smoke before we saw either bees or dogs , and when the creek widenedto a stream , we knew we must be near a village . The forest was darker  --  we were under that ocean of trees we had seen , and movingdown . My senses told me more than I could logically explain . The smell of stagnant water and woodsmoke and burned meat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dogs  --  all boiled together . It was a stew-stink I now associated with human habitation  --  not ours but other people 's . Jeronimo 's cleanliness educated my nose to these sharp odors . We might have missed the huts . They were leafy and made of peeled sticks and were the same color as the trees dying near them . But the starved dogs had rushed up to us and Francis was saying , " Fadder ! Fadder ! " and two macaws croaked at him from a branch . " Leave this to me , " Father said . He saw some lemon trees and whispered , " Juice balls . " In the stream that ran past the village there were women kneeling in muck doing laundry , slapping shirts and pants on boulders . " Those women are washing clothes , " I said.  |p216Jerry  said , " So what ? " " No one 's wearing clothes , " I said . " Not that kind . " The Indian men in the village clearing were practically naked . Shorts were all they wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe they 've only got one pair . " The washerwomen scattered when they saw Father , but he did not pause . He splashed across the stream , then kicked the water from his sandals and kept going toward the Indians and the huts . These were not the sagging tin-roofed huts that river Creoles lived in , and they were much larger than the rats ' nests we had seen in collapsing Seville . They were tall stilted rectangles , with protruding roofs and a sort of attic space beneath the grass and leaf thatching . There were ten of them . Father was saying , " No beer cans , no candy wrappers , no flashlight batteries  --  " We stayed right behind him . " And no bows and arrows , " he said . " No weapons of any kind . We 're probably the first white men they 've ever seen . Do n't do anything to frighten them . No loud noises . No sudden movements . " They were brown Indians , about a dozen of them , with Chinese eyes and heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair bunched at the backs of their heads . Just this squinting fence of men  --  the women had hidden themselves , and there were no childrenthat we could see . " Raise your arms slowly , " Father said . We raised our arms slowly . " Francis , you 're the Miskito expert . Tell them who we are . " Francis Lungley looked confused . " Who we are , Fadder ? " he asked . " Tell them we 're their friends . " " Friend ! " Francis howled . " Friend ! " " Not in English , dummy . Tell them in Miskito , or whatever crazy lingo  --  " The Indians watched Father and Francis quarrel . " They ai n't Miskito feller . They Paya or Twahka feller . Maybe we give them bunce banana . " " You 're driving me bananas , " Father said , and pushed Francis aside . Now he spoke in Spanish . He asked them if they spoke Spanish . They stared at him . He said in Spanish that we were friends  --   |p217we  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They still stared . Il e said we had a present for them . They went on staring under their swollen Chinese eyelids . " Maybe they 're all deaf , " Father said . He shook the knapsack from his shoulders and went close to the men . " Go on , open it , " he said , and spelled this out in sign language for the men , motioning with his hands . An Indian knelt down and opened the knapsack . " See ? He understands me perfectly . " The Indian looked inside , then turned the limp knapsack upsidedownand poured water out of it . He spoke one word , which none of us understood . " Quick , Francis , give me your knapsack ! " Francis unbuckled the second knapsack and said , " She all water , I " adder . " " There must be some of it left  --  maybe a little piece . " The Indians watched Father and Francis sorting through the soup in the wet knapsack . " Got it ! " Father said , and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ice block  --  maybe two ounces . We Ibllowed as he went forward to show the men . He placed it in his palm . Maybe his impatience heated his hand , or maybe it was the small size of the ice twig . Whatever it was , the small thing disappeared . Before they could look closely at it , it melted away and slipped through the cracks between his fingers . Father still held his wet hand out , but the Indians were staring at his finger stump . " I do n't believe this , " Father said quietly . He started to walk away . For a moment , I thought he was heading back to Jeronimo . But no  --  he was mumbling in Spanish and English . He had left us facing these bewildered Indians . Now he returned and gave a speech . He had brought them a present , he said . But the present had disappeared . What kind of present can disappear ? Well , that was the interesting thing  --  it was water , but a form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rock and twice as useful , good for preservingmeat or killing pain . It was very cold ! We called it ice , he said , and we had an invention over the mountains for making it out of river water . He had brought a block of it that had been as big as two men , but it had gotten smaller and smaller , and by the time wep218reached the village it was tiny . That was unfortunate , he said , because now it was gone , and a moment ago he could have showed it to them . " But I 'll be back , " he said . " I 'll show you ! " Most of the Indians were still looking at his finger . Then one of the Indians spoke very clearly , in Spanish . His face was square , and he had the thickest hair bunch , which stuck out like a short ponytail . " Go away , " he said . His teeth were black stumps . Father laughed at him . " I said it was an accident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how long it takes to drag ice that far ? " Surprised by the Indian 's order , he had spoken in English . In Spanish he said , " Do n't blame me ! Ever seen ice ? Ever touched it ? " " Go away , " the Indian said . " Thanks . We have n't eaten since yesterday . We had to bivouac on that mountain . Our water 's used up and these kids are dead on their feet . Thanks very much . " " Go ! " The word was sharp , the Indian 's black teeth were ferocious , but he looked very frightened . Father had been talking and trying to explain about the ice . Maybe he had not looked closely enough at these Indians to see that they were frightened . Maybe he assumed that their bewilderment had something to do with the marvel that had melted and leaked away . The Indians were clay-colored and they stood there like pieces of pottery about to shiver into cracks . Who were we ? they seemed to be thinking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sky ? " Real savages , " Father said . He had not seen their fear . " I guess I got what I bargained for  --  " They looked at Father 's finger stump as he waved it around . " If the ice had n't melted , they 'd be all over us  --  thank you , you 're wonderful , please give us more , et cetera . But gentlemen , our plan has melted  --  " Now the Indians were showing their teeth , the way their dogs had  --  black teeth , raw lips , squinting eyes. "  --  and I ca n't stand this Neolithic hostility  --  " Bucky said , " We go . " Francis said , " Yes , man . "  | " I 'm not moving , " Father said to the receding Zambus . " What about you , Charlie ? " I said , " I 'm not moving either . " " Tell them that . " He took my hand and pulled me in front of him , making me face the Indians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " I am not moving . " " You heard what he said ! " But had they ? They looked as deaf as when we had first arrived . The Indian who had told us to go away stood there picking blister scabs of dead skin from his elbow . Then he looked up and hissed , " Go . " " Tell him we 're staying here until we get something to eat . That 's the least they can do . A little hospitality wo n't kill them . We 're not missionaries or tax collectors . " I told them this . As I was talking , Father was whispering to the Zambus , " This place is stranger than Jeronimo ever was . What I could do here ! They have n't got a blessed thing . But look at those huts . They know how to make strong frames . " When I finished talking to the Indians , he turned to me . " Tell them we want something to eat , " he said . " I do n't want anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that need some grub . We eat , then we go . " The Indians , hearing me say this , looked uncertain . " And tell them it 's too hot here in the sun . We want to sit in the shade . " I managed to explain this , though I had to ask Father some of the Spanish words . The Indian who had spoken ( but all he had said so far was " Go away " ) backed to the largest hut and went inside . Father said , " He 's going to ask the Gowdy if it 's all right . " The Indian reappeared and gestured for us to sit near that hut . " Friendly little critters , are n't they ? " Father muttered as we sat down . " What are they trying to hide ? My guess is that there 's somethinghere they do n't want us to see . Frankly , I 'd like to snoop around . " Tired and hungry as I was , I would have been glad to get out of this place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the same . Father was unruffled , still the Sole Proprietor of Jeronimo , if not the King of Mosquitia , passing whispers to his Zambus with his all/powerful air . He did not seem to notice  --  or if he noticed , did not care  --  that the Indians had crept across the clearing and sat watchingus from a semicircle with their drooling dogs . " Sure , this place smells , " Father was saying . " They 've got no organization . But it 's a healthy climate . Cooler than Jeronimo . Fertile soil . Not many bugs . Lots of hardwood . You could work miracles here , if  --  " But Father shut his mouth when the food and water were brought . He seldom showed surprise at anything , so his sudden silencenow was as startling as one of his howls . It was the men who carried the gourds and baskets to us . He gaped at them , and , with his teeth clenched like a ventriloquist , said , " Will you look at that ! " Three skinny men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale gray under their dirt and whiskers . Father whistled softly as he sized them up . They were tall and bony and looked bruised . They wore ragged trousers and broken sandals . Two of them had headbands , the sort worn by some of the Indians . Their faces were feverish and sunken , their skulls pressed against their sallow-gray skin . Their beards and bones made me think of saints in a picture book . But they were almost smiling , and as they placed the food before us they watched us closely with curious eyes . " What did I tell you ? " Father said to us . " This is what they did n't want us to see . They keep white slaves ! " The food was boiled bananas , flat greasy corncakes , fritters , and wabool . The water tasted of dog fur . " Now it all makes sense ! Hey , " he said to one of the men in Spanish , " do you let these Indians tell you what to do ? " " More or less . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feverish smile . " What do you do for them ? " " We shine their shoes . " Father laughed at this . " You have n't lost your sense of humor . " He passed the gourd of wabool to Jerry , without tasting it . The Indians looked on from across the clearing , their heads lowered . The only sound from that direction was the growl of the dogs chewing fleas out of their gouged and scarred hindquarters . " What is your name ? " One man wet his lips at Father 's question , but another with stringy hair said , " We do not have names . "  | " Hear that ? They do n't have names . " Father glowered at the Indians . All around us in the tall trees , birds tooted and beat the leaves with their wings , and the sound of the stream was like the sound of tumbling boulders . " Probably captured them down the pike and made them prisoners , " Father said to Francis Lungley . " So these guys do all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the men said , hearing Father speak English . His starved face gave him a fine-lined expression that was both haunted and kindly . " North American , eh ? Are you from the mission ? " " Do I look like a missionary ? " Then Father whispered to him , so that the Indians would not hear . " No . We 've got a settlement over the mountains . If you could get over there  --  slip out some night  --  you 'd be safe . That 's the best way to the coast . " The man nodded and passed his hand through his beard . " Why did you come here ? " " I was just going to say . I brought some ice  --  half a ton . Well , almost . These Zambus and me . Those two are my boys , Charlie and Jerry . Wipe your mouth , Charlie . " " Where is this ice ? " " Melted . " The man smiled . " You do n't believe me ? " " Ice , " the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all smiled . The three men knelt before Father , and the first man said , " Where did you get your ice ? " " Made it , " Father said . He took a small suck of wabool from the gourd . " You should see what we 've got over there . Gardens , food , water pumps , chickens , drainage , and the biggest ice-making machinein the country . " " You have a generator for electricity ? " " Do n't mention generators to me . Tell him , Charlie . " I explained that Father had devised a method of making ice out of fire . " Your father is an intelligent man . " " Everyone says that , " I said . Father said , " They 'll work you to death here . Then , when you 're not useful to them any longer , they 'll kill you and feed you to the vultures . They 'll get some new slaves . " Father 's face darkened . " You think they 'll try anything funny with us ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other men nodded . " I want to walk out of here wearing my head , " Father said . " Do you think those Indians are listening to us ? " " They listen but they do not understand . They are very simple people . They are also very strong . " " So I gather . But you should n't be here , waiting on them hand and foot . They have n't any right to own you . You 're prisoners , are n't you ? " The man who had done all the talking shrugged . The shrug shook his whole loose-jointed body . He seemed untroubled , or else beyond caring . Father said , " Notice I 'm not eating much ? I 'll tell you why . BecauseI 've got an enormous appetite . By not eating , I do other things better . Solve problems . Work hard . That 's a form of eating , too . You should try it . If I ate , I would n't do anything else  --  " All this time , the Zambus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Father seemed glad for someone new to talk to . Maybe it took his mind off the failure of our expedition . The men whispered among themselves , then one who had not spoken before said , " You are not telling the truth , are you  --  about the ice ? " " Practically an iceberg , " Father said . " It melted to mud , but there 's a whole lot more where that came from . We 've got everythingover there . " " Guns ? " " I 've got no use for guns . If I needed them , I could make an arsenal . But that 's desperate . " But , he said , they reminded him of how he had felt in the States  --  like a prisoner , close to despair , murderous , half loco . It was frustration at the way things were shaking down , something like slavery , because the system made men into slaves . " What did I do ? I picked myself up and went away . I advise you to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs thirty feet away . They watched Father talking to the skinny men . It was impossible for me to tell what the Indians were thinking by looking into the smooth clay of their faces . The Indians might have been harmless , but the dogs were part of their group . The dogs ' fierceness made the Indians seem dangerous.  | " They want you to go , " the stringy-haired man said . " They do n't know what 's good for them , " Father said . " They do n't deserve ice , or anything else , if they ca n't show common courtesy . But you , " he said , " you 're friendly enough . " " That is our nature . " " My Zambus probably think you 're Munchies . " " Ah , Mosquitia ! " Father said , " I wish I could do something for you . " " It would be helping us if you did not anger the Indians . If you simply went away . " " Listen , one dark night you ought to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In English , Father added , " Get the drop on them . " " The Indians say there is no path over the mountains . " " They would , would n't they ? Listen , you wo n't get a road map from them . " " How far is it to your village ? " " A day 's march . More  --  if you 're carrying ice . But that 's our problem . " " You will be home by nightfall . " Father said suddenly , " I 've got half a mind to blow this place wide open and get you the hell out of here . " " That would be very foolish , " the man said , and did not blink . " Then it 's up to you . " " Go , " the man said , " or they will punish us . " We were given a calabash of wabool , and water , and a bunch of bananas . While we filled our water bag from a gourd , the three skinny men went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , but their dogs ran away as the men approached . They did not begin barking until they had reached the rooty edge of the clearing . Without their dogs , the Indians looked nakeder and even a little afraid . We left them like that , the Indians squatting , the three slaves standing . The dogs bounded forward and retreated , chasing us to the stream . They barked and stretched and showed us their wild cowardly eyes . All the other men were motionless . They were small beneath the vast hanging forest , watching us walk away . The women had not returned . The men looked as if they were posing for an oldfangled frightening picture.  |p224On  the trail , Father said , " What I ca n't make out is how they got there in the first place . " " Twahkas , Fadder ? " " No . The others . " He used a Spanish word , " The nameless ones . " Bucky said , " These jungles is fulla monkeys . " " Monkeys do n't ask that many questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something weird 's coming down here , people . " We climbed out of the forest and behind the rock steeples and up the path we had made to the ridge of the mountains . Then , where we had made camp last night , we stopped again and passed the waboolaround . We sat on the broken ice sled we had left , the remains of Skidder . Father said that someday a foreigner would find it and proclaim that a great civilization had existed here , and put Skidder in a museum . This made him laugh . " And did you see those Indians ' faces when they saw the ice ? " We looked at him . " They almost keeled over . " He began to chuckle at the thought of it . Jerry was searching Father 's face . " They could n't believe it , " Father said . " They were goggling . Flabbergasted and confounded ! " Finally  --  because everyone else was perfectly silent  --  I said , " What ice ? " " The ice I showed them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " It all melted , Dad . " " That small piece , " he said . This was not true . " You saw it , did n't you Jerry ? " " Yes , Dad . " I thought , Crummo . " Your long-faced brother 's trying to tell me we wasted our time . You need glasses , Charlie . You 've got bad eyes . Probably an astigmatism , eh Francis ? " " For true , " the loyal Zambu said . Father put Jerry on his back and carried him , while I walked behindwith the Zambus . The Zambus ' tiredness showed in their faces . It had been a bewildering trip for them , the more so because they had expected the Twahkas to have tails  --  and maybe they did thinkp225the three skinny men were Munchies . There was a grayness on the Iambus ' bodies , and smudges on the gray , like the cloudy surface of purple grape skins . As we walked , they became more certain that they had seen the ice and the amazed Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Father said , " It 's all downhill from now on . "  |p226ON  THIS downward path , in the tortoiseshell twilight , I thought of Father 's lie . I hoped he did not believe it , but how could he be rescuedfrom repeating it ? Something like this might work  --  perhaps , in our two-day absence , things had not gone right in Jeronimo  --  perhaps some small problem had arisen , enough to interrupt him , not a disaster but a hitch , to prevent him from giving a loud speech saying our failure had been a success . The Indians had not been flabbergasted ! They had only squinted at us and at Father 's wet fingers , and sent out their slaves . His lie made me lonelier than any lie I had ever heard . Yet he had spoken it confidently and said the expedition was a triumphand he could n't wait to tell Mother . Again and again I tried to remember ice in Father 's hands and amazement on the faces of the Indians . But there was none : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse and odder than his lie . They had told us to go away , and then the skinny slaves were peering at us and the dogs trying to bite our feet . " Gaw , I love to walk home tired at the end of a good day with the sun in my eyes ! " Ahead , on the path , Father went on talking to the Zambus and Jerry . " You can pack a man in ice and crisp him like celery and snap him out of sunstroke . That ought to be a useful application around here . And did I ever tell you about the advances in cryogenics ? " His voice tore through the trees and exhausted me . His confidencep227was something I did not want to hear now . I dreaded the thought of Father repeating his story in Jeronimo . And his lie scared me . Did you see those Indians ' faces ? But the Indians ' faces were confused , they had monkey wrinkles , and they had tried to frighten us away by showing us black teeth like their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much taller than me that he saw things I missed . I excusedadults who disagreed with me , and blamed myself because I was so short . But this was something I could judge . I had seen it . Lies made me uncomfortable , and Father 's lie , which was also a blind boast , sickened me and separated me from him . " Charlie 's back there doing the best he can , people ! " I loved this man , and he was calling me a fool and falsifying the only world I knew . I prayed for a hitch . My prayers were answered . Things were not right in Jeronimo . It was what I had wished , but , like most wishes that are granted , more than I bargained for . Jeronimo was struck with quietness and a thin flutter of leaves . I t had always softened and collapsed in twilight : it was the way the sun was strained through the trees , the way it glanced in weak glimmersoff the river . It was the dust stirring . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of light and no clouds . But this evening it was deadened . It had an atmosphere of disappearanceand hiding alarm that said something had just happened , like the silence after a howl . There was a low skreak and skrittle of lizards watching from the undergrowth , and on the branches birds locating perches for the night , their polite strut at sundown . Father halted us and said , " Somebody 's been here and gone . " Fat Boy was not alight . The Maywit 's house was black none of their normal lanterns  --  open windows , empty porch , no smoke . " Allie . " It was Mother  --  her white waiting face in the Gallery . Father walked toward her and asked her what was going on . She said , " I thought something had happened to you , too . " " Too ? " " The Maywits  --  they 're gone . I could n't stop them . " Father said " I knew it , " and smiled at Francis Lungley . But I felt responsible . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anything to prevent Father from bursting into Jeronimo and lying about flabbergasted Indians and ice and you should have seen their faces.  |p228Now  Father was smiling at Clover . She had run from under the house and was hugging him and explaining . " A motorboat came and took all the Maywits away . The man called you names . It was the missionary you sent back that day . Ma Kennywick yelled at him and Mr. Peaselee busted the pump and Ma said you were going to run wild when you hear about it . But you 're not , are you ? Dad , was it spooky ! " Father looked at everyone in turn and his mouth bulged with satisfaction . " Why should I go wild ? " he said . " I knew it was going to happen . " Jerry said , " What about Drainy and the other kids ? " " They went away , " Clover said . " All of them , in the man 's mo-torboat . " " What did I tell you ? " Father said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mother had come down from the Gallery with April , who was moping . Mother said , " I did everything I could , but they would n't listen . They did n't hear , they did n't recognize me , they were so frightened . " " Do n't tell me , " Father said firmly . " I know all about it . The Maywits ran off with that moral sneak in some polluting pig of a boat . Figgy 's friend . You do n't have to spell it out . I took one look across the clearing and I knew . " Hearing " Figgy , " Mr. Haddy came forward and said , " It were puppysho . Them people jump everyways and we ai n't get a dum bit of peace . Ma Kennywick scared out of her skin and bellyaching ever since . Peaselee , he bawling too , about seeing some dum fool with ruckbooses . Man , we glad you here , Fadder . " Father waited , then said , " And I know something else . " He smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fadder know . " This was Francis Lungley , telling Bucky . " Those Maywits have got a lot to learn . " If he knew everything , why did n't he know their real name ? I said , " Maywit is n't their name . It 's Roper . They 're all Ropers . " " Who says ? " I told him what the kids had said , but I did not mention the Acre or that they were all afraid of him . Jerry , Clover , and April said nothing  --  they let me take the blame for knowing . Father was still smiling.  |p229Mother  said , " You should have said something before this , Charlie . " " I thought Dad knew . " Father said , " What else do you know ? " I was going to say  --  Those men you called slaves did n't look like slaves , and the Indians looked scared . The ice melted before they could see it . You would n't let us rest , you made Jerry cry by talking about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than the river trips and probably a failure . But I said , " Nothing else . " " Then I still know more than you do , " he said  --  but when had I ever doubted that ?  --  " because I know they 're coming back . " We went down to the bathhouse and stripped off our clothes . Fatherset the showers going  --  what a marvelous invention ! It was like a car wash , with jets of water shooting from pipes on the walls . We were all inside , jostling in the fine spray , in the half-dark  --  Father , Jerry , the Zambus , and me . Fat Boy 's fire was out , so there was no hot water , but no one minded . The busy harmless sting of the showers took off the mountain dust and the bad memories . Mother said , " I would n't be so sure about that , Allie . " " She does n't believe me , " Father said . " Pass the soap . " He was proud of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat we had traded for ice . It was greasy yellow soap and felt like a handful of lard . " No additives , " Father said . " Why , you could eat that soap ! " " You were n't here . " " Did n't have to be . " " It was horrible , " Mother said . " That missionary  --  Struss . " Father said , " I know . " Hollering through the bathhouse walls , Mother said , " It seems he was up in Seville in his boat . I do n't know what he saw there , but it must have been those ridiculous people praying . He came back accusingus all of blasphemy and spreading the lies of science . " " Soap up , " Father said to the Zambus . They always washed in a squatting position , never standing up . Also , they kept their shorts on when they took baths . I could n't see them in the dark bathhouse , but I could hear the water pelting against their heads , and their spitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees , praying to the refrigera/tor ? " Mother said . " Whatever it was , your Reverend Struss was pretty upset . He came in swinging . We were doing harm , he said , leading his people astray . He was mostly yelling at the Maywits  --  he called them the Ropers . He made them get down at the riverbank while he splashed water all over them . It was a service of purification , he said , washing them clean of the sins we had taught them . Mrs. Kennywick did n't know which way to turn , and Mr. Peaselee freaked out . " Father said , " I could have told you . " " I ordered him off the property . I said you were due back in ten minutes and you 'd sink his boat . " " Good thinking , " Father shouted back through the wall . " I would have , too ! " " They packed their bags . I mean bags . Paper ones . And they all left . " Father said , " So they ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Haddy said . His mouth was against the bathhouse wall , his front teeth sticking through . " The preacher is yartering about soldiers and trouble and ruckbooses . " Father shut off the water . " What soldiers ? " he said , as we dripped . " In the mountains . Over the hills . Down the river . Up the trees . With ruckbooses . Russians and what not . Peaselee hear them . " Clover said , " He said you were just as bad as the soldiers . " " Peaselee said that ? " " The man . The missionary . He called you a Communist . " Father led us out of the bathhouse . The Zambus hopped and danced and shook their fingers to get dry . Father wore a flour sack around his waist , his hair was dripping , and his body was as white as marble . He held one arm up , like a statue in front of a courthouse . " None of this is news to me , " he said . " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be back , as sure as anything . Because this is a happy place , and the world is n't . The world is plain rotten . People are mean , they 're cruel , they 're fake , they always pretend to be something they 're not . They 're weak . They take advantage . A cruddy little man who sees God in a snake , or the devil in thunder , will take you prisoner if he gets the drop on you . Give anyone half a chance and he 'll make you a slave : he 'll tell you the most awful lies . I 've seen them , running around bollocky , playing God . And ourp231friends , the Maywits  --  sorry , Charlie , the Ropers  --  they 'll be lonely out there . They 'll be scared . Because the world stinks ! " He started up the path to the house , taking long white strides . " They 'll be back  --  just you wait . Remember where you heard it . Remember who said it . " Mother stepped beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice ? " Father was still walking . He grunted . I listened hard , then I heard him say in a low voice , " We had shrinkage . I knew it was a mistake to lug so much of it that far . " So he did not lie after all . And the Acre in the jungle was ours . It was not the same without brainy preaching and Alice doing the cooking and Peewee and Leon making baskets , but now , with fewer of us , it seemed larger , and we were able to spread out . Each of us had his own sturdy leanto . We brought a rope from Jeronimo and fixed a swing to a tree by knotting the dangling end and sitting on it . Father would not have allowed this in Jeronimo . It was n't useful , because if someone was n't swinging on it , it just hung there  --  that would have been his objection  --  and was the waste of a good rope . We ate yautia roots and wild avocados , and we repaired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the deep holes nicely disguised with boughs . One day , in a trap , we saw a snake eating another snake  --  half of it choked down his throat and both snakes thrashing their tails . The eater could not crawl away or stop eating , so we could study it in safety . We brought it back to Jeronimo . " There 's a perfect symbol for Western civilization , " Father said . A spider monkey passed through our church tree another day and sat there picking his teeth . He watched us with curiosity , as if he wanted to play . Then he sniffed , leaped from the tree , landed near a bush , and tore a small fruit ball from it . On his upward bounce he was back in the tree , eating it . He gnawed the skin and sucked out the inside , then rolled across the bough and tumbled away , yanking branches.  |p232That  was how we discovered guavas . The monkey had shown us that there were several bushes of them on the far side of the pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Jeronimo . Mother said , " We can make them into jam . " But Father said they were too small and sour , because they were growing wild . If he put his mind to it , he said , he could grow sweet ones as big as tennis balls , and , " Speaking of food , you 'd better start picking and peeling , or there wo n't be anything for lunch . " We did what was expected of us in Jeronimo , the usual chores . But we always returned to the Acre to live like monkeys . We missed the Maywits  --  I still thought of them by that name  --  but without them we had no need for the school or the store . We had the loose pages from Drainy 's hymnbook , but we no longer held church services . Anyway , it was too hot to think about hell . We knew from the Acre that it was the dry season . No one in Jeronimo knew this , or considered it important . The gardens were still growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had no inventions . The Acre was primitive , a ragged hollow in the jungle , but the grass was soft , the pool made it pleasant , and we had everything we needed . For fun , we could swim or swing on the rope . The pool was unaffected by the jungle drought . I guessed that springs fed it . But the rest of the area was very dry . We watched wee-wee ants holding funerals  --  processions of them with corpses and leaf parasols . Snakes lived in the roots of a dead tree at one corner of the camp . We kept clear of that tree , but tried to think of ways of droppingthem into the traps , to turn them into snake pits . The snakes and the walnut-sized beetles did not frighten us . We learned that the fiercest creatures were predictable , and though once it had all looked dangerous here , now it seemed more peaceful than Jeronimo . We came here to escape Jeronimo . Ever since the building of Fat Boy , Father had been visited by people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of Father . They paid him compliments . Fatherput them to work , gave them simple jobs to do , and they took the ice away in canoes . There were always strangers in Jeronimo , admiring Father 's inventions or looking for ice . " Ai n't do nothing with they ices but cool they bunya , " Mr. Haddy said . Bunya was a drink of sour juice the local people made from cassava.  |p233Father  said , " That does n't matter . They can wear it on their heads for all I care . Once they get accustomed to the idea of ice , the uses will be revealed to them . Each person will do something different  --  one man will preserve meat , another will make it into a painkiller , someone will get the idea of refrigerating his fish instead of smoking it , and how many will it bring out of sunstroke ? Sure , it may take a generation , but think of the future  --  no one else does . Fat Boy is forever . No moving parts , Figgy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That was true invention , he said , revealing something 's use and magnifying it , discoveringits imperfection , improving it , and putting it to work for you . A guava growing wild was to him an imperfection . You had to improve it to make it edible . He said , " It 's savage and superstitious to accept the world as it is . Fiddle around and find a use for it ! " God had left the world incomplete , he said . It was man 's job to understand how it worked , to tinker with it and finish it . I think that was why he hated missionariesso much : because they taught people to put up with their earthly burdens . For Father , there were no burdens that could n't be fitted with a set of wheels , or runners , or a system of pulleys . But instead of improving the world , he said , most people just tried to improve God . " God  --  the deceased God  --  was a hasty inventor of the sort you find in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea in making the world , but He started it and moved on before He got it working properly . God is like the boy who gets his toy top spinning and then leaves the room and lets it wobble . How can you worship that ? God got bored , " Father said . " I know that kind of boredom , but I fight it . " Father saw the river and said , " Let 's straighten it . " Dragging the ice up the mountain , he had talked of nothing but the cable car for passengers and cargo . He still spoke of sinking a shaft  --  tapping the steam heat in the earth 's core . And inventions themselves revealedunexpected things that Father called " the unanticipated wrinkle . " An example of this was an exposed pipe on Fat Boy 's shin . This collected drops of moisture from the humid air . Father added more pipes and turned this into a condenser that dripped into a tank . It was the purest water imaginable , and now he boasted that he could create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had not expectedthis cold pipe to behave this way . It was revealed to him . He called it the Hamstring.
