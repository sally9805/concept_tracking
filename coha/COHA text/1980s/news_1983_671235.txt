The long-awaited decision upheld the constitutionality of the " worldwide unitary " method of calculating a corporation ' s state income taxes . That is a formula that allocates a portion of a corporation ' s total income to a particular state for tax purposes. // Eleven states use this approach , which generally but not inevitably increases a multinational corporation ' s state tax bill . Other states are now expected to join them . They would discard the traditional " arm ' s length " tax method , under which the earnings of a domestic company ' s foreign subsidiaries are excluded from the company ' s state tax base. // The Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution permits a state to treat the domestic and overseas operations of a multinational corporation as a " unitary " business and to apply its ordinary tax formula to the corporation ' s worldwide earnings regardless of their geographic source. // The ruling was attacked by corporations as a green light for other states to adopt the unitary tax method , but it was hailed by state officials as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states immediately affected by today ' s ruling said they have $600 million a year in tax revenues at stake , including $500 million in California . That state ' s tax law was the subject of today ' s ruling. // The formula , which the Supreme Court previously upheld when it was applied to purely domestic corporations with multistate operations , rests on a key fraction , the state " apportionment factor . " This figure is calculated by averaging the proportion of the company ' s overall sales , property and payroll - the so-called three factors - that are attributable to in-state operations . The apportionment factor that results is the percentage of the company ' s overall income that is subject to taxation by the state. // A state ' s use of the unitary formula could discourage new investment in the state , but in some cases the additional tax resulting from the formula may be trivial compared with other reasons for a corporation to start a factory or distribution facility in the state . <> <> Other Formulas Allowable // Under today ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unitary approach for taxing multinational corporations are free to keep such formulas. // New York State , among the 11 states affected by today ' s decision , has applied a unitary tax only to oil companies . Governor Cuomo announced last week that , as part of an out-of-court settlement with a group of oil companies in a separate tax dispute , he would seek to drop the state ' s unitary tax. // In fulfillment of this settlement , the Legislature changed the tax law Sunday night , repealing New York ' s unitary tax and enacting instead a tax on gross receipts within the state for petroleum products. // Governor Cuomo , who received the bill for signing today just as the Supreme Court announced its ruling , had said earlier this month that New York ' s unitary tax should be repealed because of the challenge to it in the Federal courts. // " As a practical matter , we have repealed the unitary tax , " New York ' s Deputy Budget Director , Peter Lynch , said in Albany today . But he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the file for next year . " <> <> Comparison of Tax Methods // The Governor ' s office added that the new gross receipts tax , applying only to petroleum products until 1985 , when it expires , would not raise as much money as the unitary tax would have raised if it had been left in place and applied to the 18 major oil companies operating in New York State. // The question for the Supreme Court today was whether a state can factor a company ' s worldwide income into its tax formula without violating the Constitution ' s guarantee of due process and limits on state interference with foreign commerce. // The case , a challenge to California ' s worldwide unitary tax formula , was brought by the Container Corporation of America . The company , a subsidiary of the Mobil Oil Corporation , is incorporated in Delaware and has its corporate headquarters in Illinois . It controls 20 foreign subsidiaries. // In filing its California tax returns for three years in the early 1960 ' s , Container Corporation excluded the earnings of its subsidiaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the basis of Container ' s worldwide earnings . The company paid the extra assessment under protest - about $72 , 000 on worldwide earnings of $168 million - and sued for a refund . <> <> Calculations in California // The case illustrates how the apportionment formula works . In 1965 Container Corporation ' s income , not counting the income of its foreign subsidiaries , was $32 million , of which 9. 8 percent was attributable to California , based on the average proportion of the company ' s in-state sales , property and payroll . Using this formula , the company calculated it owed California $174 , 000. // When the subsidiaries ' income was included , Container ' s income rose to $47 million , but its California apportionment factor dropped to only 7. 6 percent , since its California operations accounted for a smaller proportion of its activities on a worldwide basis . On this basis , California calculated that Container owed $197 , 000. // While the extra tax for each corporate taxpayer in each tax year may be small , the overall result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be impressive. // California pioneered the unitary method in the 1930 ' s to prevent the Hollywood movie studios from escaping California taxes by transferring assets out of the state . In today ' s case , California estimated that it had $500 million a year at stake . <> <> Estimate of Tax Revenues // The 10 other states that use the unitary method were estimated by the Multistate Tax Commission to have a total of about $100 million in annual tax revenues at stake . Besides New York , these are Alaska , Colorado , Idaho , Massachusetts , Montana , New Hampshire , North Dakota , Oregon and Utah. // The state courts in California rejected Container Corporation ' s constitutional challenge . The company ' s appeal - listed as Container v. Franchise Tax Board , No. 81-523 - had been pending before the Supreme Court for nearly two years. // Writing for the majority today , Associate Justice William J. Brennan Jr. first reviewed the principles the Court had established in earlier rulings. // A state may not regard a corporation as a unitary business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a " functionally integrated enterprise , " Justice Brennan said . At least some part of the unitary business must be conducted within the taxing state . The apportionment formula must be fair , and it will be struck down if it results in the attribution of income to the state that is " out of all appropriate proportions to the business transacted in that state . " But the formula need not achieve mathematical perfection as long as the result is " within the realm of permissible judgment. " // Justice Brennan then rejected Container Corporation ' s central argument - that worldwide apportionment fundamentally distorts earnings by ignoring the fact that the costs of production in foreign countries are typically lower . <> <> Issue of Double Taxation // The use of the apportionment formula , Container argued , inflated the amount of income attributable to California and permitted the state to tax income already taxed by foreign governments. // While the formula is " necessarily imperfect , " Justice Brennan said , its margin of error is no greater than the error inherent in the arms ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxation have long argued that it was needed to prevent multinational corporations from sheltering their income in foreign countries . The National Governors Association filed a brief in California ' s behalf . Gov . Scott Matheson of Utah , the association ' s chairman , said today that he was " just delighted that the Court has upheld the states ' ability to tax effectively and fairly the profits of large multinational corporations which can shift their profits through a myriad of affiliates anywhere in the world. " // Justice Brennan ' s opinion was joined by Associate Justices Byron R. White , Thurgood Marshall , Harry A. Blackmun and William H. Rehnquist . Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. filed a dissenting opinion that was joined by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Associate Justice Sandra Day O ' Connor . Associate Justice John Paul Stevens did not take part in the case. // The dissenters said the California tax unconstitutionally exposed the company to double taxation on income already taxed in foreign countries. <> <>  --   --  <> Reaction to Ruling // American-based multinational corporations expressed disappointment yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax formula and said they would redouble efforts to urge Congress to pass a comprehensive tax law requiring states to adopt a uniform approach. // In a statement , the Exxon Corporation said : " Generally speaking , we believe it is unnecessary and bad policy for a state to include in its tax base income earned outside the United States . The Container case highlights the need for Federal legislation to prevent " taxation by states that overlaps taxes paid elsewhere. // Jan S. Amundson , deputy general counsel for the National Association of Manufacturers , said : " We are unhappy with this decision and look at it as a green light for states who have been unwilling , due to pending litigation , to go ahead with the unitary apportionment formula . I look to Congress to come to grips with this issue. " //
