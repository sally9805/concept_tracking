The study is the most comprehensive attempt ever made to measure the role of the Federal Government in redistributing income . The report brings together , for the first time , data on taxes and benefits provided by private employers and government agencies , showing their combined effect on poverty and income distribution. // The report reflects years of work by the Census Bureau , the nation ' s pre-eminent statistical agency , known for its political neutrality and its methodological rigor . But Congressional aides and lobbyists said the report could have a major political effect , discouraging President-elect Bush and members of the new Congress from making significant reductions in Government benefit programs as part of any package to cut the Federal budget deficit. // If Social Security or other benefit programs significantly reduce income inequality , that might be a reason for members of Congress to hesitate to cut such programs , since lawmakers sense that economic disparities between the poorest and most affluent Americans have grown in the last eight years . Social Security benefits lifted 15. 1 million people out of poverty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million from 50. 6 million , the bureau estimated. // At the same time , Social Security reduced the poverty rate - the proportion of people who are poor - to 14. 9 percent from 21. 2 per-cent , it said . In 1986 , a family of four was classified as poor if it had an annual cash income of less than $11 , 203. // Social Security was responsible for an even more dramatic reduction in the poverty rate for the elderly , to 14 percent from 47. 5 percent , the report said. // By contrast , cash welfare programs lifted only 2. 1 million people out of poverty and reduced the poverty rate by less than 1 percentage point , the Census Bureau said. // The " equalizing influence " of the Federal Government results mainly from cash benefit programs like Social Security , not from the tax system and not from programs established as part of the " war on poverty " in the 1960 ' s , the report said. // Over all , the Census Bureau said , the tax system has a relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than intended by many Federal and state legislators. // " Although the Federal income tax structure is commonly regarded as progressive , in actuality taxes had a relatively minor effect on the redistribution of income , " the report said . A tax is said to be progressive if the rate increases with the amount subject to taxation. // Government benefit payments to individuals , totaling $299 billion in 1986 , were slightly more than half of taxes collected in that year , the report said . But the benefit programs had four times as much effect in reducing inequality in the distribution of income , it said. // The study shows how much each segment of the population paid in taxes and received in government benefits in 1986 . Using a complex but widely accepted measure of income inequality , the Census Bureau found that programs like Social Security and Medicare , which pay benefits regardless of a person ' s financial need , had four times as much effect in reducing inequality as benefit programs based on a test of need . <> <> Income Definition Expanded // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanded definition of household income , including $90 billion of employer-provided health insurance and $247 billion of capital gains realized from the sale of stocks , real estate and other property . In the past , only cash income was counted , and capital gains were omitted. // The report brings together data on taxes and benefits provided by private employers and government agencies , showing their combined effect on poverty and the distribution of income . It shows the degree of inequality in American society before and after taxes , before and after government benefits. // The Census Bureau counted Medicare and Medicaid benefits as income only for households that met basic food and housing needs . The means-tested programs , like welfare , Medicaid and food stamps , accounted for $49 billion of household income , or less than one-fifth of the income provided by Social Security and other benefit programs with no means test . <> <> Highlights of Report // Among the highlights of the report were these findings : // * Under the standard definition of income , the most affluent fifth of the population received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The proportion declined by less than 1 percentage point , to 45. 7 percent , when the Census Bureau took account of taxes , capital gains , health insurance provided by employers and various government benefits. // * The proportion of all household income received by the poorest fifth of the population rose by less than 1 percentage point , to 4. 7 percent from 3. 8 percent , when the Census Bureau counted the value of government benefits and took account of taxes. // * White households paid $530. 7 billion in taxes and received $256. 6 billion in government benefit payments to individuals in 1986 . Blacks paid $34. 2 billion in taxes and received $36 billion in benefits . Hispanic households paid $22 billion in taxes and got $15. 4 billion in benefits. // * Elderly households paid $60. 7 billion in taxes , representing 10. 4 percent of all income and payroll taxes counted by the Census Bureau in 1986 . But they received $204 billion in government benefits , or 68. 4 percent of all such benefits in that year . Elderly households are those with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reflect taxes they paid in their prime working years. // * Households with children under 18 paid $242. 2 billion in taxes in 1986 and received $64. 2 billion in government benefits. // Gordon W. Green Jr. , a Census Bureau official who supervised preparation of the report , said it showed that " taxes do not reduce inequality nearly as much as government benefits . " Also , he said , it shows that benefit programs like Social Security , which are not based on financial need , " lower income inequality and poverty more than other government programs. " // Robert M. Greenstein , director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , a research institute here , said the report tended to overstate the effects of taxes in reducing inequality because it did not take account of sales and excise taxes , which are regressive . <> <> An Experimental Effort // The Census Bureau said the study was an experimental attempt to assess the economic well-being of Americans by estimating income and payroll taxes and by measuring the value of such benefits as food stamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicare , the health insurance program for the elderly , and Medicaid , the health-care program for the poor. // The bureau did not try to measure the value of " public goods " like national defense , police and fire protection , schools and roads . " The value of such goods can not be assigned to individuals , " it said. // The report presents data for 1986 because the tax information needed to make estimates for 1987 was not available when the report was prepared. // The distribution of income generated by employment , without any intervention by government , was " much more unequal than the distribution under the official definition of income , " which includes Social Security and other cash benefits , the study said. // Government benefits of all types increased the median household income by 15 percent , to $23 , 220 from $20 , 180 , a difference of $3 , 040 , the Census Bureau said . The number of households with income above the median is the same as the number with income below it. // At the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income of all households by $298 billion , to $2. 6 trillion from $2. 3 trillion. //
