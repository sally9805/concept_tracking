When it was first attempted nearly 20 years ago , the operation was hailed as a marvel of technical virtuosity and medical logic . Cerebral bypass surgery was designed to circumvent one of the most common causes of strokes : a blockage in one of the arteries that carry blood to the brain . To reroute blood around a blocked vessel , the surgeon uses a nearby , less vital artery to build a bypass road . Taking this detour , blood continues to flow to the brain , and the risk of a stroke 's occurring is presumably lessened . <P> The operation involves advanced microsurgical techniques , the joining of arterial walls with thread finer than a human hair , and exquisitely delicate maneuvers by the surgeons . Nonetheless , hundreds of doctors have mastered its intricacies , and the operation has been performed on thousands of patients around the world . There is just one problem : for most patients , it does not seem to help . <P> That was the conclusion of an eight-year , $9 million study reported in last week 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke ( NINCDS ) , in Bethesda , Md. , involved 1,377 patients at 71 leading medical centers in such cities as Budapest , Kyoto and Cleveland . Each of the subjects had experienced either a minor stroke or warning signals known as transient ischemic attacks . Such attacks , which may result in dizzy spells , temporary loss of vision or speech , or numbness in a hand or limb , signal that arteries supplying various parts of the brain have become narrowed and a stroke may be imminent . <P> All the patients were given careful medical attention , including drugs to reduce the risk of blood clots and control high blood pressure , which is frequently a contributing factor in stroke . Roughly half the participants were randomly assigned to undergo bypass surgery to connect the superficial temporal artery , which nourishes the scalp , to an artery on the surface of the brain . ( The scalp has an ample supply of blood from other vessels . ) The central question posed by the investigators : Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths ? Their conclusion : " The answer is no . " In fact , the operation may actually increase the risk of stroke in certain patients . <P> The results came as a surprise to doctors involved in the study . " We started off because we were encouraged by the operation , " says Dr. Henry Barnett , professor of neurology at the University of Western Ontario in Canada and chief coordinator of the project . " Disappointing is the one single word that describes it best of all . " Even worse , the study showed that among patients who underwent the surgery , there were 14% more fatal and nonfatal strokes than among those who did not have the operation . The reasons for this finding are not entirely clear , though some doctors speculate that the increased blood flow resulting from the surgery may cause damaging changes in blood-pressure levels in the brain . Also , any operation , particularly around the brain , carries a certain risk . What is clear , says Dr. Sydney Peerless , who directed the surgical aspects of the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discount the benefits . " Says Peerless , chairman of neurosurgery at Western Ontario : " I 'm one of the first to do this operation . Now I 've stopped . "
