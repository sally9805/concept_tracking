TIME TO GO <P> by Stephen Dixon <P> Johns Hopkins ; 181 pages ; $12.50 <P> In the era of the blockbuster novel , short-story writers have had a hard time supporting their habit . While Novelists John Updike and Saul Bellow can afford occasional forays into the briefer forms , a hard-bitten short-story adept like Stephen Dixon , 48 , has had to toil as a bartender , waiter and pajama salesman to pay for the privilege of persisting in an unprofitable genre . But a boomlet in short fiction seems to be at hand . Publishers are wagering in increasing numbers that storytellers can attract readers beyond the pages of the little magazines . <P> In Dixon 's case , that risk seems well worth taking . Over the past 24 years he has had some 200 stories published in 125 periodicals , ranging from the venerable North American Review to the ephemeral Nitty-Gritty . Among his seven books , published mainly by small presses , his latest , Time to Go , emphatically establishes him as one of the short story 's most accomplished if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the protagonist of most of his stories to repeated and often farcical failures in love . Whether named Mac , Jules or Will , he is conspicuously a loser . Speaking with a strikingly distinctive voice , this hapless character is alternately self-pitying and self-mocking , weepily sentimental and stonily sharp-witted . He unceasingly endures abuse , rejection , infidelity , abandonment and most of the other mortifications that can befall a man in the throes of passion . <P> End of Magna catches the antihero in the act of talking himself out of the love of his life . " She 's too good for me . She 's too beautiful , too intelligent , too perceptive , too creative , too everything , " begins an interior monologue that could be a manual of masochism . In that story the woman walks out kindly . Not so the 20-year-old in For a Man Your Age , whose explanation of why her lover is too old for her is cruel beyond the call of love or duty . She knows all a man 's vulnerabilities and has deadly aim : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young man in bed . You make love the way you do because you have to . " The poor chump replies by asking what else is wrong with him and by telling his tormentor : " I 'd marry you today and conceive with you tonight if you wanted and we could . " <P> Much of the satiric power of Dixon 's stories springs from his reversals of sexual stereotypes . His women tend to be aggressive , and his standard male character is at best foolishly romantic . Yet the final cycle of stories in this collection suggests that a wimp can turn into a mensch . For the first time in the Dixon canon his male character gets the girl . In the title story he actually marries her , in spite of an imagined , ironic commentary on his courtship by his late father . The story Wheels lovingly tells of the baby that is born of the marriage . In one affecting and indeed surprisingly beautiful scene , the man , in diapering his child , is reminded of a time when he nursed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hero 's romantic miseries has brought to Dixon 's work not only joy , but insight into the keener shadings of grief . - By Patricia Blake
