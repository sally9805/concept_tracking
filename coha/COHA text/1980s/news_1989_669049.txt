Dear Ann Landers : Right now I am so mad I could spit tacks . My husband and I are seniors . We love to watch the soaps . We have come to know the characters so well that they are like members of our own family . Our favorite soaps are " Days of Our Lives " and " General Hospital . " Recently , at the most critical moment , Peter Jennings cut in with a news bulletin . He reported that the Chinese government was executing students ( which we already knew ) , causing us to miss out on the crisis involving Scorpio , Sean and Frisco in " General Hospital . " They don ' t rerun soaps , Ann . If you miss something it ' s gone . The following day , Tom Brokaw broke in with more stale news about China and he ruined " Days of Our Lives . " Neither Peter Jennings nor Tom Brokaw told us anything that could not have waited till the evening news . Please , Ann , let these two gentlemen know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Speak for Millions ( Palo Alto , Calif . ) Dear Pal : I have had several letters from readers who share your anger . I would like you all to know that the interruptions are not Jennings ' and Brokaw ' s idea . They merely work for the networks . Their bosses decide when and if they should break in with a " special report . " If you don ' t want your soaps interrupted by news bulletins , call your local stations and complain . Dear Ann Landers : You missed the mark with your response to the daughter of an Oregon nursing-home resident . The 89-year-old mother was being oversedated , and you suggested that she complain to the physician . Ann , who do you think was writing the prescriptions for those drugs ? Your readers would have been better served had you referred them to the Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program . Federal law ( the Older Americans Act ) authorizes ombudsman programs in each state to investigate and act on complaints relating to nursing homes . Ombudsmen look into everything from abuse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find their ombudsman program in the phone book , they should call the local Area Agency on Aging ( AAA ) or their state Office on Aging , or they can write to the National Center for State Long-Term Care Ombudsman Resources , 2033 K Street N.W. , Suite 304 , Washington , D.C. 20006 . Ann , you can do a great service for millions of nursing-home residents and their families by printing this information . R.S. , Akron Dear Ak : Here it is and I thank you . I ' ve checked out all your recommendations , and the folks in charge are ready , willing and able to handle anything that comes their way .
