Companies tighten up on an old form of waste <P> One of the most closely watched signs of business activity is the level of company inventories . As sales slump during a recession and stockpiles of unsold goods swell , businessmen begin dumping their inventories and cutting back on orders from suppliers . In the process , layoffs surge throughout industry , and inventories grow skimpy . Then , when sales-hungry businessmen detect the first signs of an improving economy , they begin to rehire workers and restock warehouses . The level of inventories , thus , is usually a telltale signal of a recession or recovery . <P> Inventory liquidation has been driving the economy steadily lower since last December . Week after week , in wave after wave , companies have been emptying warehouses , trimming stockpiles and cutting back on orders from suppliers . This was the major cause of the 3.9% drop in the gross national product during the first quarter . Says Otto Eckstein , chairman of the Data Resources Inc. economic forecasting firm : " The most significant factor behind the economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's huge liquidation of inventories . " <P> With interest rates high and sales projections dismal throughout virtually all of American industry , few businessmen seem eager to start hastily rebuilding their stocks to former levels . Instead , more and more firms are studying ways to hold down costs and operate with leaner inventories . <P> Tighter control of stocks is being made possible by the spreading use of computers throughout business . With computers , managers from supermarkets to steel mills are able to know , from one minute to the next , exactly what is in their warehouses and storage bins . This helps save hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars a year by holding stocks to the absolute minimum levels needed to keep production lines humming . <P> At Stew Leonard 's Farms , a large retail food outlet in Norwalk , Conn. , computerized check-out scanners keep watch over the shelf and warehouse stocks of more than 650 different consumer items . Says J. Michael Peters , the firm 's financial controller : " These scanners have helped tremendously to keep inventories in line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take days , sometimes even weeks , to check out our inventory-to-sales position . Now the scanners provide the data instantaneously . " <P> Computerized inventory control has proved especially helpful to heavy industries like steelmaking . More than simply keeping track of large stockpiles of raw materials , such as iron ore and coking coal , steel firms also have to make sure that stocks of finished goods , ranging from rolled steel to ingots , sheet metal , cable and wire , are neither too large nor too small for projected demand . Says Albert E. Martz , a general manager for Jones &; Laughlin Steel Corp . of Pittsburgh ( 1981 sales : $4.7 billion ) : " As a result of higher interest rates , we are trying to run leaner and operate closer to the bone . Now we maintain less inventory in order to accomplish the same thing . "
