THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment AFRIEND writes : A little business called me to San Francisco a few weeks ago , about two hours ' worth of business that I managed to work up into a full two-day itinerary so as to justify the long flight , and then I flew out a day early to attend to my real business , which was a drive across the Golden Gate Bridge , and over Mount Tamalpais , along a boulevard of eucalyptus trees , to Stinson Beach , a village where I 've spent three weeks in the past seven years and which I wanted to see again . Stinson Beach looks out on the Pacific from the foot of a mountain , and for seven years I have been pacified by visions of it . When I lie down at night , and night thoughts crowd in around me , and I am about to get up and spend the night looking out the window , I imagine a bright spring morning in Stinson Beach : the sandy path from a rented cottage over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sound of high surf  --  and by the time I spread a towel on the sand and lie down on it morning has come and I get up and take a shower . The path is no more than sixty yards long , through tall pampas grass and a patch of dark-green succulents and two little jungles of flower garden , and yet it has served me so well so many nights  --  a short hike from the cool , dim house to the sea which takes me into a sweet sleep  --  that I wanted to see it again and commit it more clearly to memory . I flew to San Francisco in the morning , wearing a pair of horn-rimmed glasses I had broken the day before by making a sharp right-hand turn into an iron pillar at the office . The pillar had not been there earlier . A carpenter friend of mine had glued the break  --  on the bridge , between the eyes  --  and I did n't think about it all the flight west over the mountains , the drive north into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel on Nob Hill , sat on the bed , and took the glasses off , and they broke in my hand . Without my glasses on , I see San Francisco as a few objects in the foreground of a vast Abstract Expressionist world , not so different from Omaha or San Jose in the same circumstance  --  the Bay might be a bay or it might be soybeans , the Berkeley hills might be a storm on the horizon . So I hiked down the hill toward Market Street , feeling a little ill from lack of focus , and found a stationery store and bought a bottle of super-glue , found a restaurant , and sat down and ordered a cup of coffee and got busy repairing my glasses . The directions that come with the little plastic container give a person pause  --  especially a very nearsighted one . " Warning , " they say . " BONDS SKIN INSTANTLY . CONTAINS CYANOACRYLATE ESTER . Avoid contact with skin and eyes . If eye or mouth contact occurs , hold eyelid or mouth open and flush with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurs , apply solvent . " In order to see what I was doing , I had to hold the glue dropper and the glasses pretty close to my eyes , and the thought of the warning made me a little shaky . I wondered if I had any sort of personal identification on me . ( " S.F.P.D. SEEKS IDENTITY OF VOICELESS MYOPIC PERSON WHO GLUED OWN MOUTH AND FINGERS SHUT YESTERDAY . " ) I squeezed one drop of glue on the right spot , bonded the glasses , then , putting the cap on the dropper , got a little glue on two fingers and , for one horrific second , instinctively tried to rub the stuff off and felt my fingers bond , then pulled them apart at the last moment ! And sat for a few minutes until I recovered from the shock . I did n't touch the cup of coffee . I put the glue bottle in my pocket and the glasses on my face , and walked two blocks to Powell Street and caught a cable car heading up Nob Hill . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a pole , and when the driver sang out " Hold it in on the right ! Watch your back ! " I leaned in toward an old woman sitting on the bench as we swept past a parked truck , its extended side-view mirror a few inches from my back . The glasses held together for the drive across the Golden Gate and up the mountain and along the coast . The highway is a roller-coaster of a road , with plenty of dramatic curves that hang on the mountainsides over sheer drops , and in the event of sudden glasses breakage I was going to plant one lens in my right eye , like Erich von Stroheim , and keep going , but I simply hugged the right shoulder , avoided looking at the ocean far below and the tops of tall trees in the valleys ( I have a mild form of acrophobia , based on a belief that if you look down from a great height mysterious ground forces will pull you over the edge ) , and cruised down into Stinson Beach , past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parking lot at the beach . I got out and walked . Everything was there , as I have remembered it so many times : the beach houses on pilings , the dunes , the surf and surfers , the cottage where I stayed ( its shades pulled ) , and the magical path . I stood by the cottage and looked at it for a long time . I heard , faintly , in the nearby surf , some voices from old vacations , including the shouts of an eight-year-old boy who is now fifteen . The sun shone down , and as I walked slowly up the path and over the dune I felt sorrow and danger recede into the ocean and thought I 'd like to lie down on the sand and take a nap . I am back from San Francisco now , with a clear image of the path in my head : the greens are really green , the air smells of real salt water , soft sand is underfoot . I also have two little patches of dried super-glue on my right thumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tensile strength of up to five thousand pounds per square inch . The strength of a clear image of a path leading to the ocean can not be expressed in pounds , but I estimate that mine should be good for another two or three years of ordinary use . ? ? M. le Ministre WE caught up with Jack Lang , who is France 's Minister of Culture , just before he finished his official business on a recent three-day visit to the city . It was Saturday morning , and at the River Cafe , beneath the Brooklyn Bridge , M. Lang was posing against the Manhattan skyline for a cover photograph for Paris Match . The wind snapped canvas tarps on tugboats passing under the bridge , and their crews wore knit hats and thick gloves . On the restaurant 's outdoor terrace , M. Lang cut a. trim , glamorous figure . He wore a double-breasted tweed suit , a pink shirt with French cuffs , a black silk tie covered with large red dots , and amber wing tips over maroon socks , and he showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curls accented the sharp line of his nose , and everyone who watched the photo session , including the restaurant 's piano tuner , a couple of waiters , and the driver of the Peugeot 505 borrowed by the French Embassy for the Minister 's visit , thought the pictures would be great . During the session , we looked over the schedule that M. Lang had followed since he arrived , on Thursday , via the Concorde . As a sample of his cultural activities , here is the first day 's program : His flight landed at 8:45 A.M. He checked in at the French Consulate , on Fifth Avenue , and was whisked over to the Times for an interview with ten cultural editors and reporters . He lunched with Bernard Malamud , Susan Sontag , and other writers . He walked through the Metropolitan Museum 's van Gogh exhibition . He stopped to see the film director Martin Scorsese , at a studio on Fifty-fourth Street . He met with Jack Valenti , the president of the Motion Picture Association of America . He represented his government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main purpose of his trip  --  during which over a hundred French movies would be shown in about twenty-five weeks at the Festival Theatre , on Fifty-seventh Street . Then he went to a party at Regine 's . " In Paris , " M. Lang told us , in English , after the session , " the days are much more busy . Anyway , this trip is exciting . It is a change for my head . " At a table inside the restaurant , he sat down for coffee , and we asked what he would report about his trip to the President of France . " I will tell him about my triumph over sleeplessness , " M. Lang replied , in French , relying on a young man from the Embassy to translate . " For the opening of the film festival , they showed ' Le Bon Plaisir , ' which is a new movie starring Catherine Deneuve , and I sat next to her . I had not slept in two nights , so keeping awake was quite an achievement . The film helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' Minister Falls Asleep on Shoulder of Star . ' Ce n'est pas hien ! " We asked M. Lang how he got to be the French government 's senior official for culture . " My whole personal life has been identified with art , " he said . " In the sixties  --  I was young at the time ; I was a student  --  I founded the World Theatre Festival , in the French city of Nancy , and I 've been involved with the arts ever since . " " Were you ever an actor ? " we inquired . He replied , " Yes . But a very bad actor . " He added , " I was in the Aeschylus play ' Seven Against Thebes . ' " " What role ? " we asked . He smiled , and cocked his head . " The King , " he said . M. Lang continued , " My job has never really been theatre , of course . My job has been to be a professor of international law . I never wanted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help France support the arts , and I do . As Cultural Minister , I 'm trying to break down borders . I 'm trying to abolish the frontiers between the beaux-arts , like painting and sculpture , and the minor ones , like photography and design . After I took office , three and a half years ago , the government nearly doubled its budget for culture . I 've used the funds to bring art to a wider audience in France . Andre Malraux , the great French writer , was the first Minister of Culture in France , after the Second World War . He revived an old tradition , and supported museums and theatre and monuments . He gave clout and prestige to the arts in France . He was a founding father . But he had no policy of sup- " Call in the family , Nurse McIntyre . I think he 's about to process his last words .

But I can do only so much . Everything equals culture , even when you are n't aware of it . When you buy a record , the choice you make is a cultural act . The way you dress , what you eat  --  even when you pay no attention to them , these are statements . Every citizen must take responsibility for culture . " M. Lang headed for his Concorde flight , due in Paris at 10:45 P.M. , and we asked if he had plans for the evening once he got back . " Perhaps I will go to have some oysters , " he said , smoothing his tie . " I do n't like to go straight home . I like to get the feel of the city . " Relentless and ilbsolute GRIDLOCK  --  the vehicular chaos that develops at mid-Manhattan street intersections when cars , trucks , and buses become caught in an imrnov able embrace  --  is the nightmare that haunts our city 's Department of Transportation from Thanksgiving to New Year 's Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intersection , blocking oncoming traffic ) , and unchecked gridlock can , according to the domino theory of automotive responsibility , cause pedlock , a motionless mosaic of people and cars , such as can be seen in the streets around Rockefeller Center during the holidays . We picked up these nuggets of transportation lore during a recent visit with Samuel Schwartz , a tall , thin , bearded engineer in his mid-thirties , who is the city 's deputy transport commissioner for traffic operations and a passionate advocate of mass transit . Mr. Schwartz invited us to spend the morning with him on December 14th , a Friday and the first Gridlock Alert day of the holiday period , to observe how the city had mobilized its various forces  --  five hundred traffic agents , three hundred traffic police , and sixty-five tow trucks ? to keep things moving in midtown Manhattan between Thirty-fourth and Sixtieth Streets . ( That day was chosen because a computer had concluded that the two Fridays before Christmas were among the heaviest days of the year . ) We met Mr. Schwartz at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he was preparing to survey the incoming commuter traffic from a police helicopter . " I want to see how much backup there is in the major facilities serving Manhattan  --  tunnels , the East River bridges , the major parkways , " he told us . " If the queues are unusually long and slow-moving , I 'll know we 're in for trouble later on in the city . Normally , eight hundred thousand vehicles are in Manhattan each day . Today  --  although we 've been urging the public to use mass transportation  --  we could get an additional hundred and forty thousand . If we have nine hundred and forty thousand vehicles clogging the Manhattan grid , we could have a grid resembling the transit-strike days . " We hopped into a seat beside Mr. Schwartz and watched as he hooked up his communications system  --  green headphones to monitor police frequen- ? cies , and a wireless radio for talking with his traffic-control headquarters , in Queens . Then , as the helicopter lifted off into a pale-pink sky , we looked down at three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were proceeding briskly along the Belt Parkway toward the city . Strings of red lights indicated backup as we approached the Verrazano Bridge and the Battery Tunnel , but Mr. Schwartz told us that things looked pretty good . " That long line of buses going into the tunnel tells me that extra buses have been added  --  that lots of people are taking public transport today , " he said . Turning right , we flew up the East River , to find traffic moving everywhere except on the upper level of the Manhattan Bridge . And except for a couple of accidents ( a stalled car on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway at Sands Street , and a jackknifed furniture van balanced precariously on the shoulder of the outbound Long Island Expressway at Woodhaven Boulevard , which had produced a rubbernecking backup on the inbound lanes ) the situation seemed under control . " I am very much encouraged , " Mr. Schwartz said . " I think people are beginning to believe us when we say that there is practically no more space in midtown Manhattan for private cars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent full ? " As we swung across northern Manhattan and turned south along the Henry Hudson Parkway , he pointed to a line of red lights edging past a closed left lane . " That construction at Fifty-sixth Street is illegal , because road work is not supposed to begin until ten o'clock , " he said . " I 'm going to call a highway-patrol unit and get those trucks out of there . " We circled the Empire State and Chrysler Buildings to check on midtown traffic ( " Thirty-fourth Street is heavy , and Thirty-eighth is all fouled up from the tunnel , but Fifty-seventh is doing surprisingly well " ) and touched down at the Sixtieth Street heliport . " I saw a tractor-trailer making a U-turn at Park and Fifty-seventh , " Mr. Schwartz said , with a smile . " He 's going to wonder who reported him . " Then we got into a brown traffic car with Mr. Schwartz and two of his assistants and set off down Second Avenue to check on potential gridlock situations . " The day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because we are determined to keep streets clear and traffic moving , " Mr. Schwartz said . " In the last three years , our average vehicular speeds have increased from seven point nine to nine point five miles per hour on the avenues and from four point seven to JANUARY 7,1985 five point seven miles per hour on the cross streets . " He added that one side of each midtown crosstown street had been reserved for parking by vehicles with commercial plates , while the other side had been designated as a no-standing zone , to be kept completely free of cars . " We have banned standing by any vehicle on Fifth Avenue from Thirty-fourth to Sixtieth , and on every avenue where there are red-zone bus routes , " he said . " A parked private car will be towed away . A private car with a sitter waiting in a no-standing zone will be given a summons . Commercial vehicles double-parked or standing on the wrong side of the street will also be ticketed . And at the intersections we have teams of mobile gridlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spillback is a moving violation . If you get a summons , it can cost you two points on your license and more than fifty dollars in fines . Most cabbies and many truck drivers are aware of these rules and obey them . But , as Christmas approaches , the private cars can get pretty wild . " We passed an unattended express bus parked in a red-zone bus route ( " Ticket him , " Mr. Schwartz said to an assistant ) , a large truck parked in a no-standing zone ( " Green truck from New Jersey , try to find some room on the other side of the street , " he said over his loudspeaker ) , and a black limousine waiting at a side entrance to Saks ( " Move it out , please , " he said to the startled driver . " I have tow trucks right behind me " ) . Then , on West Forty-seventh Street , we came upon four cars with diplomatic plates parked in a commercial-vehicle zone opposite the Ghana Mission to the United Nations . Three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar fate when its driver , an agitated African in a mulberry velvet suit , shot across the street and produced a thirty-minute permit to deliver security mail . " That 's O.K. for now , " said one of the assistants , " but if you 're still here in thirty minutes we 'll take you . " Circling back uptown , we encountered our first serious gridlock . It was at the corner of Fifty-third and Third Avenue , and was caused by the squeezing of westbound traffic on Fifty-third Street into a single lane between a construction site on the right and a line of cars waiting to pull into a garage on the left . Two transit policemen appeared and began instructing the drivers of the cars blocking the avenue to turn north , to the acTHE NEW YORKER companirnent of angry arguments from several drivers . Mr. Schwartz hopped out of his car to reward with a redwhite-and-blue Gridlock Busters button the driver of a white Honda who had refused to enter the blocked intersection despite a cacophony of blaring horns behind him . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said as traffic began to flow up the avenue . " It 's beginning to look as if forty thousand drivers who might have come into the city today had changed their minds . I think that word has got around that we 're both relentless and absolute . In recent weeks , we 've ticketed or towed a former chairman of the M.T.A. , a former first lady of the state , the F.B.I. , the Secret Service , and more than a thousand cars with press or diplomatic plates . No excuses and no exceptions . " An American Dilemma CONSTERNATION ! Uproar ! Unpleasantness ! A debate rages : Have images replaced facts as the grease for our national axle ? Some say yes ; some say no . NVe did a small-scale study late last month , at ceremonies marking the " rededication " of Sixth Avenue as the Avenue of the Americas and honoring with plaques the six nations  --  Dominica , St. Lucia , Belize , Antigua and Barbuda , St. Christopher and Nevis , and St. Vincent and the Grenadines  --  that have joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some image , then some facts , and then you decide .

If it was that sort of nation , it could boast about having the oldest botanical garden in the Caribbean , containing a breadfruit tree that was cut from the original breadfruit plant brought to the area by Captain Bligh . St. Christopher and Nevis is better known as St. Kitts and Nevis , according to Suzanne Ratnus-Jones , counsellor of the islands ' Mission to the United Nations . Christopher was Columbus ; Nevis he named for the volcanic peak at that island 's center , which , garlanded in clouds , reminded him of Las Nieves , a snowy peak in the Pyrenees . The people are very warm and friendly . The islands were the sites of the first British settlements in the Caribbean , and are the most recently independent .

Sugarcane , citrus fruits , lobster , and mahogany form the backbone of the country 's economy . " Another thing is we wish people would stop calling us tiny , " Mr. Leslie added . " Every time someone writes about Belize in a newspaper , it 's ' tiny Belize . ' But we 're as big as El Salvador . We 're twice the size of Jamaica . We 're thirty times the size of Barbados and Grenada put together . "
