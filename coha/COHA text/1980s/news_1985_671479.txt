In this installation , Flavin doesn ' t explore , as he usually does , the properties peculiar to fluorescent , whereby a bar of one color can be manipulated to cast the glow of another . The piece is , rather , a relatively artless celebration of primary hues for their own sake , each reflected in the polished surface of the gallery ' s parquet floor , and collectively they bathe the white walls with only faintly perceptible tints . Some sculptors harbor a desire to see children scrambling over their work ; if Flavin is one of them , he would have been pleased to see the children that were crawling ecstatically around the floor during the reviewer ' s visit , supplying the " performance " that the lights seem to promise. // The artist ' s previous show was dedicated to his golden retriever , but though she has not been displaced in his affections , this installation is for a human friend and is named " Ksenija ' s Frieze " for her . A summer fixture , it is Castelli ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also on view , in the smaller rear gallery - to wit , one of Ellsworth Kelly ' s " Curves , " a roughly six-foot-long fan shape made of weathering Cor-Ten steel that has turned a beautiful purplish brown and a Donald Judd box of milled aluminum that has three recesses in it . Both are recent pieces . The third sculpture is Claes Oldenburg ' s monster " Lipstick With Stroke Attached ( for M.M. ) , " of 1967 . Cut from metal plate and enameled , it consists of the lipstick uppermost , pointing downward , and , bolted to it , the plate denoting the " stroke , " which ends in an arc on the floor . ( Through Aug. 31 . ) Also of interest this week : // The Door Show ( Annina Nosei Gallery , 100 Prince Street ) : Introducing her show , the dealer proposes that the door , like art , is as much a symbol as a reality and adduces statements from some of the 12 participants to prove it . Antoni Tapies , for instance , believes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the infinitely broader play " of a multitude of visions and feelings . The artist ' s 1970 " Marron et Taloche " is a painting of a door , executed rapidly in brown and black on a thick sandy ground and with a plasterer ' s tool imbedded in its lower half. // The Italian artist Pizzi Canella quotes St. Luke on the necessity of entering through the door that is " strait , " meaning narrow , and titles his canvas after Andre Gide ' s " Strait Is the Gate . " His image is a large sepia portal with a cream-colored opening and , inside , another tall sepia shape that fans out at the bottom , where a dash of white suggests a figure. // One of the artists to use real doors , Chuck Connell , paints on his a boy standing trussed up in the corner of an empty blue-green room . This can be taken as a vision of the artist-as-child , kidnapped by mysterious forces - perhaps from the small house depicted below him . Still , given the apprehensive expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of an overture to a Balthus-type seance . Jean-Michel Basquiat ' s door has glass panels and , scrawled with graffiti , is a comment on ghetto life . Evidently , Vincent Gallo ' s door once secured a safe , but now its rusty surface serves as the ground for the ghost of a still life called " Big Tall Wish " - two scarcely perceptible bowls of blue fruit reposing on a table and a chair , respectively . Karel Appel , on the other hand , is represented by the door to a 17th-century Dutch canal house , transformed by corks and fragments of metal into a Picassoid face ( 1947 ) . The well-known plagiarist Mark Bidlo contributes a facsimile of the famous door that Marcel Duchamp installed at his Rue Larrey apartment in Paris. // By now , the show ' s term-paperish theme has worn pretty thin , leaving the works to sink or swim as they may . One that sinks without a trace is Julian Schnabel ' s inconsequential sheet of paper painted on both sides with vaguely figural shapes and clamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cabinet door . Not very memorable , either , is Mimmo Paladino ' s tall stretcher enveloped in canvas , which is deep ultramarine on one side and zebra-striped in black and yellow on the other , with swags of yellow and red draped along the top. // The two best efforts are Robert Rauschenberg ' s " Catbird Door , " a large , deft assemblage of cardboard cartons mounted on a wood frame that can be viewed with equal satisfaction from either side ( 1970-71 ) ; and Sol Lewitt ' s five-pointed star painted in india ink on and around the door to the gallery ' s office . ( Through July 12 . ) Funny Art ( Concord Gallery , 451 Broome Street ) : A performance artist who has been called " the balladeer of life in Lower Manhattan , " Paul McMahon has compiled a show of art that makes him laugh . The artist includes his own work because , as he explains in some introductory doggerel , " He has no shame/And will do anything to promote his name . " Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn on a blurred photograph of a figure that could be male or female ; two postcards drawing attention to the similarity between an astronaut and a dodo , and a concertina of postcards depicting what must be the seven most boring buildings in the world. // Michael Smith , a performance artist who is also known for his work in video , is represented by the installation , " Mike ' s Dressing Room . " If it ' s funny that an artist ' s principal interest is himself , then this wall full of caricatures of Smith accompanied by the accoutrements of a " star " - furniture , clothes , toilet articles - is a scream . Commissioned by artist friends , the drawings render Smith as a media figure in various situations . In a picture signed " Your Pal , Whitney , " he contemplates piles of money from the National Endowment for the Arts. // The photographer Robert Cumming hits the spot with mild absurdities such as the beans painted with faces and slotted into the spiral binding of a notebook to dry ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of photographic posters advertising the United States , one of which concerns a young man in a dinner jacket holding the flag with the legend " Onward to the Final Victory of Capitalism . " Then , giving equal time to their native country in an all-red poster , they thank " Comrade " Stalin for their " happy childhood. " // There are faintly humorous moments in Steven Gianakos ' s series about a spermatozoon dressed in various costumes , but for the most part the jokes are either amateurish attempts at New Yorker-style humor or just plain obscure . Even William Wegman and Ed Ruscha , the cream of the art world ' s humorists , fall a bit flat , giving resonance to Jessica Diamond ' s question , " Is This All There Is ? " which is lettered in black on rice paper . Of the more than 40 drawings representing Wegman , most are whimsies , such as " Cat on Cortisone , " " Boy Biting Another Boy ' s Lip , " and just one , the ribald and hence indescribable " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruscha , McMahon has achieved the seemingly impossible - finding works by this artist that are all but impenetrable to one of his most devoted fans , notably " Makeup Department , " a color photograph of a makeup mirror reflecting an assortment of fruits . A compensation , though , is the silkscreen print of a house miles from anywhere that , according to its title , is armed with a complete electronic security system. // There is no sense in making a meal of this , for with humor being as subjective as taste in food , the reviewer ' s disappointment may well be another spectator ' s delight . Besides , McMahon deserves a big hand just for trying to inject fun into ths scene . ( Through July 12 . ) Recent Acquisitions ( Franklin Furnace , 112 Franklin Street ) : A well-known center for performance art , the nine-year-old Franklin Furnace also maintains an archive of small works by American and foreign artists . Many of these are artists ' books , which are seldom books in the conventional sense , although some contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call for a bibliophile ' s scrutiny . Most , however , are unique works and , in this show of recent donations to the archive , the third in a series of annuals , these might be better described as collages , assemblages or even found objects . For example , Klaus Groh ' s " Handle With Care " consists of a red plastic rose and a brush with red paint on it bound to some paperback books with a leather strap , and Maurizio Nanucci ' s " Sixty Natural Greens " is but two accordion-pleated rows of color photographs of leaves pinned to the wall . On the other hand , Christiane Baillargeon ' s is at least a parody of a book , its pages being ribbons of paper about an inch and a half wide and 12 inches long . Bound into a tiny spine , the strips , tinted in pretty colors and with their edges slashed , all bear a line of handwriting and have toothpicks glued to them vertically at intervals. // Well-known contributors include Gilbert and George , whose printed prospectus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - even " philosophy sculptures . " Lucas Samaras , too , is present with a real book , " Album , " published in 1971 ; so are Vito Acconci and Richard Nonas. // Consisting of more than 200 items , the show would take at least two hours to examine thoroughly . This is a very personal kind of art that insists its beholders meet it more than halfway , bespeaking in its hermeticism an acute loneliness on the part of its makers . ( Through July 27 ) . //
