Finance Minister Boris I. Gostev , in disclosing the anticipated 36. 3 billion ruble deficit to a session of the Soviet parliament , or Supreme Soviet , said big Government subsidies of mismanaged industry and agriculture were among the main culprits. // He said in an interview that similar deficits had been run in previous years , but never disclosed publicly . Usually the Government reports a slight surplus in its budget when it announces the financial plan for the following year. // // Barometer of Economic Ills // The Finance Minister said he did not consider the deficit alarming by Western standards , but he said it was a barometer of economic ill health and could contribute to inflation. // Inflation is another economic phenomenon the Soviet Union has just recently acknowledged , although there is no reliable estimate of how high inflation has been because the Soviet Union does not have a retail price index to measure changes in what consumers really pay for their goods. // The new 494 billion ruble , or $790 billion , budget also bulges with evidence of the priorities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases in spending to modernize the consumer products industry , housing and health , education and environmental protection . <> <> Lure Western Investment // As part of the effort to revitalize the economy , Konstantin F. Katushev , Minister of Foreign Economic Relations , said in an interview that the Government , eager to lure more Western investment , has agreed for the first time to let foreign companies own controlling interest in Soviet joint ventures. // The officially admitted Soviet budget deficit is about 4 percent of the country ' s domestic production - including the total the Government estimates is involved in the shadow economy , which is not officially recorded or included in the official budget. // By comparison , the United States deficit in the $1. 06 trillion budget for the fiscal year just ended was about $150 billion , somewhat more than 3 percent of the gross national product , which was about $4. 8 trillion in the last fiscal year. // This afternoon the Finance Minister , Mr. Gostev , said his main strategy for restoring a budget balance would be to cut subsidies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if necessary . <> <> ' We Shall Have a Stock Market ' // Another measure to alleviate the deficit , he said in the interview , would be to raise new money for industry and agriculture by selling shares of enterprises to workers and outsiders . The newspaper Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya reported last week that the Government has approved such a plan. // " This means we shall have a stock market , " Mr. Gostev told a small group of reporters in St. George ' s Hall of the Great Kremlin Palace. // The Finance Minister said the Government had also begun a wide-ranging study of Western tax systems with the idea of introducing an entire new tax system here in the 1990 ' s. // Mr. Katushev , the foreign trade official , said new laws to be introduced early next year would eliminate the current limit of 49 percent foreign ownership , and ease other restrictions on Western business operations here. // Mr. Katushev predicted that the new laws on joint ownership would not set any specific limit on foreign ownership , but he indicated that some Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nikolai I. Ryzhkov , has reportedly told visiting European economic officials that foreigners would be allowed to own up to 80 percent of a joint venture. // The decision , ceding a large measure of management control and ownership to capitalists , is another indication of how far the Soviets are willing to bend Communist ideology to salvage their economy. // Mark Vecchio , an American lawyer specializing in Soviet-American ventures , said today that the offer of controlling interest would be an enticement to some companies that have held back from the Soviet market for fear of losing control over quality , patents or technology . <> <> ' An Unbalanced Economy ' // But he noted that this would not remove the main obstacle that has dampened the interest of Western investors - the Soviet insistence that foreign partners take most of their profits home in Soviet rubles or commodities. // Soviet officials began acknowledging the existence of a budget deficit earlier this year after many years of fiscal legerdemain produced paper surpluses. // Mr. Gostev declined to estimate for reporters the deficits in the current or past years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // " This is not a problem that has cropped up all of a sudden , " Mr. Gostev told the Supreme Soviet . " It is a result of an unbalanced economy , of excessive subsidies , of huge losses caused by extensive management methods , parasitic attitudes and passive financial policy. " // Mr. Gostev ' s budget report today was more detailed than those previously made public , but it did not provide the full accounting of military spending Soviet officials have promised . Following traditional practice , the Finance Minister identified only the 20. 2 billion rubles , or $32. 3 billion , budgeted for maintaining armed forces personnel , but made no mention of weaponry , bases or other military expenses. // Some Western analysts say they believe large parts of the military budget are buried in vague budget categories covering capital investments and in the budgets for such state-owned industries as aviation , electronics and machine tools. // Mr. Gostev said one major factor in the deficit was the falling price of the oil Moscow sells on the world market , which he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government was also battered by the cost of cleaning up the 1986 explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , and the loss of income from alcohol sales due to the Government campaign against alcoholism. //
