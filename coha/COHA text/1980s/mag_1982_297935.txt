A woman updates Roget 's <P> What is a woman ? A " petticoat , skirt , moll , broad , " according to one recent U.S. edition of Roget 's Thesaurus . Also " the fair sex , girlie , distaff side , Venus , nymph , wench , grisette and bit of fluff . " Such archaisms have a kind of antique charm for veteran Rogetophiles , but new times demand new stereotypes . Accordingly , the British publishing firm of Longman advertised in the London Times Educational Supplement for an editor to update its standard 1962 version of Roget 's . The result , out last month after more than three years of work , brought some shocked reviews . Cried the London Sunday Times in a headline : ROGET is ZONKED BY A MODERN MS . <P> The zonker is Susan Lloyd , 41 , onetime librarian and modern-language teacher , who answered the Longman advertisement and got the job . Her main task was to update Roget 's often Victorian language , deleting some of the fustier phrases , adding or redefining 20,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hype and quadraphonic sound . " A modern man or woman , " she says , " may work as an ombudsman , a psephologist , a spokesperson , a gogo dancer or a deejay . " But the disturbed newspaper reaction came from the fact that Lloyd 's updating featured an assault on sexism . Indeed , the word sexist has been added to the new edition of the thesaurus , right after " biased , twisted , jaundiced . " Women are no longer listed as a sub-category of mankind but of humankind . And among the exemplars of " excellence , " " superman " has been joined by " wonderwoman . " <P> Sexism in language has been angrily debated for at least a decade . Not only are school textbooks being purged , but scholarly committees are re-examining even the Bible to determine whether the Son of Man , for example , should be renamed the Child of God . This may sound like faddism , but reformers insist that the wide spread use of terms like policeman and chairman helps decide who gets the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call things sometimes governs what they think about them . Traditionalists retort that language can not and should not be subjected to such moral judgments . <P> Peter Roget was sympathetic to both philosophical approaches . An English physician of Swiss ancestry , he invented a slide rule , did basic optical research on what was to become movie film , and spent half a century intermittently listing words according to six quasi-scientific categories of meaning : abstract relations , volition , affections , and so on . But when he first published his thesaurus in 1852 , his goal was partly the Utopian search for a universal language . Editor Lloyd , who once taught English in Uganda , faintly echoes that tone . " The new edition exhibits my interests , " she says . " It was bound to . " One result of this approach is a large supply of environmental words ( recycling , renewable energy sources , greenhouse effect ) ; another is a special sensitivity toward racial terms .
