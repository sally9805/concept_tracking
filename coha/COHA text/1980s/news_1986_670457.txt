" It has played the most vital role for black writers of any theater company , " says Gus Edwards , eight of whose plays have been produced by the Negro Ensemble Company . " It gave me a home. " // " It ' s been the only place I ' ve worked since 1974 , and if there ' s been any improvement in my work I think it has had to do with working for the N.E.C. , " says Charles Fuller , who won the Pulitzer Prize for " A Soldier ' s Play " - one of four Fuller works produced at the Negro Ensemble Company. // Mr. Williams , Mr. Edwards and Mr. Fuller are among dozens of black playwrights , actors and other theater artists who have worked with the company over the last two decades . Like many of their colleagues , they found there opportunities that simply did not exist elsewhere. // " I shudder to think where I would have been without them , " says Mr. Williams . " The N.E.C. is where I received a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not have a commitment to doing original black works . I started writing in college , but it really wasn ' t until I found the N.E.C. that I began to focus and sharpen my writing . " <> <> Season-Opener in Previews // This year marks the company ' s 20th anniversary , and the theater is currently introducing its new season with " The War Party , " a new play by Leslie Lee that is in previews and will open Nov. 5 . The author of " The First Breeze of Summer , " which won an Obie Award when it was produced by the Negro Ensemble Company in 1975 , Mr. Lee has set " The War Party " in a community poverty program in a Philadelphia ghetto , where the plot revolves around a demagogic activist , his idealistic rival and a mulatto Bryn Mawr student searching for her own identity. // Also on this season ' s schedule are " Ramona , " a comedic drama by Mr. Edwards , who has redone the Carmen theme and set it in the Caribbean ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playwright Paul Carter Harrison , and at least one other work yet to be announced. // The company ' s 20th anniversary finds the theater in its usual precarious financial straits , but asserting its usual determination to endure . " It ' s been a fight for survival , and that has very often shaped the latitude of what I could do , but in many ways we have succeeded far beyond my own expectations , " says Douglas Turner Ward , the theater ' s founder and artistic director . " Still , in some ways our plight has worsened in the 20 years since we started. " // The Negro Ensemble Company was founded as a permanent resident acting company that would offer both a professional season and a full-scale training program . " There was no permanent place for the utilization and continued development of black artists back then , " Mr. Ward observes . " It made no difference whether you were a star or a neophyte ; sometimes there was just nothing happening , and the stars were out of work as much as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatrical priorities as paramount . " The primary goal for us has always been our artistic aims , " he says . " The raw material of our content often comes out of our struggle , out of the social issues that confront us - but if we ' re trying to change society and address ourselves to an immediate topical issue , we ' re engaging more in a sociological than an artistic aim . A bad play is by nature counter-revolutionary. " // The Ford Foundation provided the initial financing , and the company began with 14 salaried members . " The beginning was the ideal , " says Mr. Ward wistfully . " I still sustain the illusion of a company by hiring the same veteran actors over and over again , but I don ' t really have a company any more . The expansiveness of our original program has contracted , and we ' ve been on a survival course for the last half of our existence . We ' ve been reduced to the producing function . We still sustain our writers ' workshops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productions . " <> <> A ' Vision of America ' // The writers who have been produced by the Negro Ensemble Company constitute a long and noteworthy list , as do the actors who have worked with the theater . " The N.E.C. has helped such an enormous number of people , " says Mr. Fuller . " They ' ve maintained probably the finest black professional theater on earth , a place where all of us could go to get our work done . They ' ve allowed black writers to get their vision of America on the stage. " // Although the company has consistently been supported by Federal and state grants , other sources of funds have been harder to come by . " A nonmusical , nondancing black theater project is not going to be anybody ' s darling , " Mr. Ward notes . " There ' s still the perception that it might rise to bite the hand that feeds it , and some sources of support that are available to the majority theater are not available to us. " // The black community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 percent of its audience , but there are limits to its contributions . " The very constituency we appeal to and exist for doesn ' t have the economic resources to assure our existence , " Mr. Ward explains . " And this society has not yet reached the point where it deems what we do sufficiently important to assure our existence . Some way , by hook or by crook , we ' ve come through , but at this point I couldn ' t really predict whether we ' ll be here in another 20 years . That ' s a big if. " // However , Mr. Ward is philosophical about his theater ' s continuing difficulties . " Black people are catching hell now in all ways in this society - economically , educationally , every which way , " he says . " There ' s been a backlash , a conservative tide that has gone far beyond benign neglect , and in that climate it would be foolish to expect not to be affected . The plight of the N.E.C. and of black artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // Such problems notwithstanding , Mr. Ward declares himself to be well pleased with the far-ranging impact of his theater . " For my generation , when we went to school , very little of the material we studied came out of the black experience , " he notes . " These days the younger people just take it for granted that these plays have always been there , but when we started that was not the case . What we have already accomplished is imperishable.
