Lee , the eldest , was a flamboyant lawyer with a taste for cocaine who specialized in defending drug dealers . He carried thousands of dollars in his cowboy boots and handed out gold bracelets engraved with his motto , FREEDOM . When he bought a limousine equipped with a bar and television , he also ordered a special nook for the gun he always carried . In December 1978 , the night after he picked up the car from the dealer , he was shot to death during a robbery in his fortress-like office . He was 41 .

But last month he agreed to plead guilty to the murder-conspiracy charge and testify against Harrelson in return for a ten-year maximum sentence and the right not to testify against his brother . <P> U.S. Government Prosecutor Ray Jahn argues that Jimmy Chagra was " greatly fearful of Judge Wood . " He points out that Chagra 's own lawyer had requested that Wood excuse himself from the case , citing bias , but Wood refused .
