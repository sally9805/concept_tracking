Walter E. Williams , a black economist , disagrees . He says , ' ' They just want to take a cheap moral stand . It is moral posturing. ' ' // Dr. Williams , who is a professor at George Mason University , explained by telling of a talk he gave on the topic to a group of Presbyterian ministers . He gave them cards symbolizing shares of such companies as International Business Machines , which does business in South Africa , and asked what the ministers would do with them . They indicated they would sell them on the New York Stock Exchange. // // Williams responded by pointing out that , by their own standards , they would then be seeking an ' ' evil person ' ' to buy the stock . They would be tempting someone to do something wrong - hardly a Christian stand. // To avoid that dilemma , should the church burn the stock ? // The ministers felt it would be impractical to reduce their church portfolio that way. // But if they did toss the stock in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the company , give IBM managers more control of the company , and provide other shareholders a greater return on their money. // What if they sold their shares and actually gave the money to South African blacks ? // Says Professor Williams : ' ' It would be like selling a slave and giving the money to other slaves . ' ' The slave would remain a slave . The IBM stock would be in other hands. // Those people calling for divestiture ' ' have not thought through the moral inconsistency , ' ' he argues. // Nonetheless , those who are advocating stock divestiture , disinvestment by foreign companies in South Africa , or trade or other economic sanctions against South Africa have been winning the day lately. // Last week , for example , the US House of Representatives passed a bill imposing sanctions on Pretoria ; the Senate did so earlier . The legislation would ban new investment in South Africa , bar imports of products from South African-controlled companies , and end direct air service between South Africa and the United States. // But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Fraser Institute in Vancouver , British Columbia , the reasoning behind such moves is fallacious . They , of course , keenly oppose South African apartheid as evil . But they believe the power of foreigners to alter South African racial policies is limited and that other , less damaging steps may be more effective. // Furthermore , Mr. Walker objects to charges that those who oppose various punitive measures against South Africa are necessarily in favor of apartheid . Not so , he says. // Here are some counterarguments to punitive measures. // On sanctions : In the past , trade or economic sanctions most often have not produced the desired results. // ' ' I don ' t think there is a single instance where sanctions of this kind have worked , ' ' Mr. Walker says. // ' ' Generally it reinforces the power of the government subject to the sanctions , ' ' says Williams , a frequent visitor to South Africa . Governments under siege use that situation to justify totalitarian measures. // Fidel Castro was able to tighten his rein when faced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same. // As for South Africa , an arms embargo prompted the government to create a domestic arms industry that is now successfully selling many of its products around the world . It also built up facilities for turning abundant domestic coal into liquid fuel to ease the danger of an oil embargo. // Further , if the sanctions do some economic damage , it will likely hurt most blacks in South Africa and in neighboring countries. // Chief Gatsha Buthelezi , the head of the vast Inkatha movement , says that the blacks in South Africa have for decades been mistreated by their enemies in that nation . Now , he says , they are about to be mistreated by their friends in the world. // Gavin Relly , chairman of the Anglo American Corporation , South Africa ' s largest mining and industrial conglomerate , calculates that if the European Community , the United States , Japan , and the Commonwealth countries imposed effective sanctions on South African mineral exports , it would cost 130 , 000 jobs in South Africa , of which 100 , 000 would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ' ' duplicitous and cynical morality ' ' in supporting sanctions. // ' ' Since it is well known that there are international surpluses of coal , steel , iron , and uranium , and these are areas in which Australia and Canada are in direct competition with South Africa , the moral ease with which these countries have found themselves able to contemplate bans on these specific products is absolutely clear for all to see , ' ' he told a Johannesburg audience. // Walker does not believe that Canada agreed on sanctions for cynical reasons - to boost its own mineral exports. // ' ' It is a knee-jerk kind of action , ' ' he says . ' ' It is based on the idea that anti-apartheid folks must also be sanctions folks. ' ' // Certainly , however , it is easier for countries or individuals with less to lose ( or something to gain ) from sanctions to take a strong pro-sanctions position. // Canada , by the way , did go ahead with the sale of $8 million in wheat to South Africa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada ' s prairie provinces. // Indeed , Walter believes the common people of the world will not back up official sanctions imposed by their governments when it is to their economic advantage to do otherwise . Canadians bought more South African wine when devaluation of the rand made wine inexpensive. // On disinvestment : If foreign companies were forced to sell their investments in South Africa , they would have to sell them at huge discounts to South African whites , some of them Afrikaners . The whites would get a bargain . Many of these companies put their money in South Africa before it was considered immmoral. // Those advocating sanctions do not offer to put up their own money to compensate the companies forced to withdraw from South Africa. // Moreover , many of the foreign companies operating there have been at the forefront in advancing blacks and working against apartheid. // ' ' Sanctions may nip in the bud the more liberating elements in South Africa , ' ' Walker charges. // What should be done by foreigners to help South African blacks ? // Professor Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping them with education and other needs. // He advocates a political proposal of Leon Louw , the Afrikaner president of the Free Market Foundation , that South Africa become a federation along the lines of Switzerland , where the cantons have great powers compared with the federal government . This division into many small states would have the advantage of permitting some states to be dominated by whites , other states by blacks of various tribes . But all South Africans would have the vote and be free to move at will throughout the nation . Apartheid , a system of racial discimination that has important roots in the economic privileges sought by whites , would be gone. // Contariwise , leaders of the African National Congress , the outlawed black-rights ' group , want a unitary state in which a black government would dominate and be free to redistribute income. // Williams fears that if outsiders push the relatively moderate government of President Pieter W. Botha too hard , Botha could lose out politically to white , racist hard-liners . These people , he says , would have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retain power. // Williams believes that a transfer of power to blacks is inevitable . ' ' Violent confrontation will ultimately work , ' ' he says . But if that revolution is massively bloody and achieved by extremists , the result could be the substitution of a ' ' black brutalizer for a white brutalizer . ' ' Then the struggle ' ' might all be for naught. ' ' // He asks : // ' ' Do we in the Western world want to take responsibility for that ? ' ' // //
