Secretary of Defense Caspar ( " Cap " ) Weinberger last week summarized his foreign policy views in an interview with TIME Correspondent Gregory H. Wierzynski . Excerpts : <P> <P> On economic moves against the U.S.S.R. : " I have n't called for a trade embargo , but I have called for a very substantial tightening of technology , which I think we have fed to them by legal means and had it pilfered from us by illegal means . We have to recognize that trade with the Soviet Union is not like trade with Britain or France or Japan . The profits that arise from trade in the Soviet Union go directly , for the most part , to the military . In the case of a power that uses everything it can to enhance its military , you have to apply different standards and different protection rules . " <P> On Poland 's debt to the West : " Default is an option that ought to be considered each time the loans come up . The people of Poland obviously have to be considered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use more of their resources for nonmilitary means , then that ought to be considered . " <P> On U.S. forces in El Salvador : " I am with the President . He was asked about combat troops and said we have no plans that way . " <P> On missile sales to Jordan : " The question is n't whether they will get them or not . The question is what influences will accompany them or who will supply them . We discussed with Jordan the lack of desirability of their getting them from the Soviets ... But there was never any offer made , and they did n't make any order . We discussed the procedures ... and ultimately told them that they would have to decide for themselves . " <P> On his relations with Haig : " There has been a lot of garbage written about us , but the basis for it is just about nonexistent . I have enormous respect for Al Haig . I meet with him regularly once a week at breakfast . We are on the phone three or four times a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazement , though it is sometimes too serious for that , how this persistent mythology is fanned and kept alive . I guess it makes good reading . "
