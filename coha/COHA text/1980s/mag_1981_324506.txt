The brothel run by Theresa Brown in San Antonio may not have been the best little whorehouse in Texas , but from all appearances its business was satisfactory . Brown kept a list of clients that allegedly included the names of some 3,000 prominent south Texas politicians , judges , businessmen and sports figures . After her establishment was raided by police last October , Brown gave the list to Armandina Saldivar , a writer for El Pueblo , a local newspaper that appears about once a month . When Brown was convicted of " aggravated promotion of prostitution , " the paper began laying plans to publish the names . <P> Not so fast , said Brown , who is seeking a new trial . She obtained a temporary restraining order blocking publication . Last week the paper managed to get the order lifted , and El Pueblo printed the first 19 names ; editors are now busily preparing to run off 40,000 copies of the remainder of the list . No one in San Antonio doubts who the first 3,000 buyers will be .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
