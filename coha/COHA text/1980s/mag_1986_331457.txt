" Is that Urumqi time or Peking time ? " asked a visitor to the capital of China 's remote Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region , as he prepared to adjust his watch . A local official tartly replied , " Urumqi time is Peking time . " He was , of course , correct , even though the provincial capital is 2,000 miles west of Peking . Until now , all time in China , which sprawls across four time zones , has been Peking time . But the Middle Kingdom has been undergoing rapid change in every sphere , and time is no exception . As of Feb. 1 , Urumqi was allowed to set its clocks according to geography 's ukase rather than Peking 's . <P> In the past , informal Urumqi time was two hours behind Peking 's and a source of much confusion . Government offices , for instance , were required to open at 8 a.m . Peking time , or 6 a.m. in Urumqi . Summer travelers to Xinjiang found themselves sitting down to dinner when it was officially 10 p.m. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority in the province , however , has been agitating for more autonomy , and the time change is seen as a minor concession to their demands . As for other distant reaches of China , well , they must continue to ignore the celestial evidence and abide by Peking 's version of the time .
