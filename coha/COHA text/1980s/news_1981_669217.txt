Judging from the commotion , you would scarcely realize that the President wants to spend more money than ever on science and technological development . Compared with last year , he is asking for a healthy 21 percent rise in federal funding  --  $6. 9 billion for fiscal 1982 as opposed to $5. 7 billion actually allotted in fiscal 1980 , which ended last June. // The outcries arise because of rearranged priorities. // The administration has not cut its requests below past general levels of spending . It has cut down the increase in spending proposed by the Carter 1982 budget , which requested $7. 6 billion for science , space , and technology . This is being done within a strategy that eliminates or defers new projects , that gives higher priority to programs deemed central to an agency ' s mission and of wide interest than it does to those deemed peripheral and of narrow interest , and that emphasizes short-term payoffs over long-range return. // Thus , the National Science Foundation would not be too tightly constrained overall by its $1. 034 billion budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new programs would be clobbered . A $75 million program to upgrade research equipment at colleges and universities would be deferred , and support for a proposed $87 million science education program would be cut to something like $25 million . Also a project to build a 25-meter telescope in Hawaii would be postponed . International activities and programs to help women and minorities rise in science and engineering professions would be sharply curtailed , as would support for the social and behavioral sciences. // This has stirred much protest . D. Allan Bromley , president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , sent a telegram to the President calling the cuts in science education support " disproportionate . " He warned , " To expect scientific and technological progress while abandoning efforts at improving science and engineering teaching in our schools is illogical and a disservice to the nation ' s interests. " // The American Psychological Association wrote to David A. Stockman , director of the Office of Management and Budget : " Perhaps the most visible cause of declining scientific advancement in this country is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million was budgeted for equipment only after a serious consideration of national needs. " // The National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) also was treated rather gently in terms of overall funding . President Carter had proposed a 21 percent budget increase . President Reagan now asks for about a 12 percent rise that would give NASA around $6. 2 billion. // Space shuttle development would be well funded , although money for scientific experiments on shuttle missions would be cut back . The fourth shuttle orbiter would not be deferred , nor would the option to build a fifth orbiter be eliminated as had been earlier proposed. // In space science , NASA could go ahead with the Galileo project to send an orbiter and probes to Jupiter . Also , full funding would be provided for support of all spacecraft still returning useful data . These include the Pioneer spacecraft now orbiting Venus and the two Voyagers , one on its way to Saturn and one proceeding to Uranus. // Bur no new planetary missions are in the offing , a prospect that Bruce Murray , director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to loss of US momentum in this field . A project to map Venus by radar would be postponed until at least 1988 . The Space Telescope to be launched by shuttle would be funded . But a gamma ray telescope astronomers want would be eliminated . And , what is especially controversial , the US half of the International Solar Polar Mission would be canceled. // This mission was to have sent two spacecraft over the north and south poles of the sun respectively . The European Space Agency ( ESA ) was to provide one craft while NASA supplied the other . Now NASA , saving money here to maintain the Galileo project , has cancelled its probe , even though the project is well advanced and an international commitment is involved . ESA officials are protesting strongly to the US State Department. // Other science-related budget have fared similarly , suffering sometimes painful cuts . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) allocation was reduced to $800 million from $1. 05 billion . Among other things , some 38 National Weather Service forecasting offices would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coastal Energy Impact and Coastal Zone Management Programs would be closeD . The administration thinks states should take over such programs from which they directly benefit. // One major project NOAA was to share with NASA and the Navy  --  the National Ocean Satellite System ( NOSS )  --  will be deferred for an overall saving of $1 billion. // Within the Department of Energy , some $40 million would be cut from the general science programs . This would reduce support for such areas as high energy physics , where funding levels are already so low that major particle accelerators can not now be used to full capacity . Solar energy research and energy conservation programs would be cut by 60 percent and 75 percent respectively. // In short , the proposed Reagan budget would give science and technology strong overall support but would trim certain areas severely  --  some scientists would say unwisely . However , unhappy as many scientists are about specific cuts , they seem generally to accept the need to reduce federal expenditures , with support for science bearing its share of the burden. // This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to anticipate whether or to what extent the proposed reductions might be restored by lawmakers , although there already is strong lobbying to recover the funds for university research equipment and science education . Pressure from Western Europe to restore the US half of the Solar Polar mission may be more effective because it involves the international good faith of the country. // Yet , even here , the US economy may come first . Sen. Harrison H. Schmidt ( R ) of New Mexico , a former astronaut who is chairman of the science and space subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee , has expressed concern for the US international posture . But he also affirms the need to make substantial budget cuts and says science , space , and technology budgets must bear reductions. // What disturbs many scientists is the appearance that sensitive budget decisions are being made with no advice from them . President Reagan , at this writing , had yet to name a science advisor . Even members of his science advisory transition team have had little access to the White House during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
