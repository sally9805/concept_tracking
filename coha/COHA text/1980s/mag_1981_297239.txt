Arguing Abortion <P> To the Editors : <P> Yes , a woman has the right to choose what happens to her body April 6 . She makes that choice when she decides to have intercourse and when she does or does not use birth control . Pregnancy is the result of her choice . <P> Nancy Bohm <P> Gennansville , Pa . <P> Given the choice , a large percentage of pro-choice advocates would never have an abortion . We simply want the freedom to make that choice . <P> Nancy J. Fredette <P> El Paso <P> Any pro-lifer who has n't adopted at least one child more than he is financially or emotionally capable of caring for should keep his opinions to himself . <P> Al Rosie <P> Detroit <P> I was one of those unwanted babies . Fortunately , because abortions were not so readily available in the 1950s , I was allowed to live . I became part of a wonderful family that was thrilled to get a child . I can not thank my natural mother enough for allowing me the gift of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul <P> Although it is often suggested , adoption is n't a solution .

They would probably support Satan himself if he ran as a pro-lifer against a pro-choice candidate . <P> Donald G. Johnson , M.D. <P> Bar Mills , Me . <P> The right-to-life activists claim that they are working to strengthen the family . Does a 14-year-old child on welfare with an unwanted offspring constitute the kind of family they have in mind ? <P> Margot Close <P> Keene , N.H. <P> Why should I , a taxpayer , help finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who chose to make herself susceptible to pregnancy ? Should I be expected to help pay for their losing gambles ? <P> Alice E. Glendening <P> Stuart , Fla . <P> Ideally , most people want to raise a child in a loving , comfortable home with both parents . The truth is that not all children are wanted and cared for , and the ultimate responsibility falls on the taxpayers . <P> Patty B. Hall <P> Pampa , Texas <P> The people who support a " Human Life Amendment " are anti-life . A young girl , whose future lies ahead of her , or a 40-year-old grandmother should not have to have her life destroyed because of rape or incest , nor should she be forbidden to do something about it . <P> Melissa R. Vance <P> South Hadley , Mass . <P> The arguments that people should have freedom of choice and that one person 's morality should not be imposed upon another are the same as those once used to defend slavery .
