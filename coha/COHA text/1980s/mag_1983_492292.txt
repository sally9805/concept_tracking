A VISIT WITH SOVIET JEWS by Senator Charles E. Grassky F must confess my uneasiness as , i the plane touched down on the runway of the Moscow airport earlier this year . My wife , Barbara , and I had never been to a Communist country . Of course , I expected a cool reception , but the one I received was as frosty as Moscow 's January air . The airport was noticeably missing the bustle of excited travelers normally encountered in Western countries . Few people leave the Soviet Union for vacations or business trips , and when they do , their faces are likely to express fear , not joy . That anxiety becomes tenfold for those who seek to leave forever . As I walked through the drafty terminal , I recalled the story of a middle-aged Soviet Jew who had received an exit visa and had boarded the plane bound for Vienna , when he was suddenly called off the plane . His visa had been revoked . My " official " mission brought me to Moscow to meet with Soviet agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country from a different perspective . I had come to visit Russian Jews who wished to emigrate but have been denied permission  --  the so-called " refuseniks . " The first evening , I took a taxi to the apartment of Arkady and Helen Mai , longtime refuseniks . Accompanying me were Ally Milder , staff counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee , who had met the Mais on a previous trip ; Steve Rovner , chairman of the Des Moines Committee of Concern for Human Rights in the Soviet Union and Ron and June Daniels , also members of the Des Moines committee . After a ride up a creaking elevator , we wandered through the dark corridors in search of their apartment . I soon discovered the Mais were everything that official Russia is not : warm , spontaneous and forthright . They greeted Ally with hugs and kisses , of which there were some left over for me . Then they whisked us off to another apartment where a group of refuseniks had gathered , waiting eagerly September ' 83 inar on Jewish History and Culture , Arkady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moscow Symposium on Jewish Culture in December 1976 , authorities placed his family under house arrest and warned him to resign from the symposium 's organizing committee . In February of 1977 , the KGB threatened to expel him from Moscow , and shortly thereafter his phone service was cut off . Arkady has continued his efforts to help the refuseniks ' cause by writing letters to Soviet officials , including the late Leonid Brezhnev . His letters , however , were never acknowledged . Arkady 's wife , Helen , a former lecturer in Anglo-American literature , has been unable to find work since the couple became refuseniks . The KGB watches them continuously while he and his wife manage to get by on his meager pension of 120 rubles a month ( about $156 by the official exchange rate ) . Each refusenik in the cramped apartment had his own unhappy story to share . Viktor Fulmakht and Boris Klotz continue to study Hebrew and Jewish philosophy , although this is forbidden in the Soviet Union . Fulmakht has been given what is known as a " final refusal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reapply for a visa . Klotz suffers from eye trouble and lost a child in 1980 to crib death . Yuli Kosharovsky has been struggling to emigrate since the 1960s , but has little hope of ever receiving permission to leave . His words to me as I left that night were , " I now know there is little hope for me , but please do not forget my children . They must be allowed to live free , as Jews . " I reflected on the Moscow refuseniks as our group traveled to Leningrad on the night train . I had believed that they were seeking to leave the Soviet Union for greater political and economic freedom , but I now realize their major goal was to escape religious persecution . The Soviets vehemently deny the existence of anti-Semitism in their nation . Yet of the more than 100 ethnic groups in the USSR , only Jews are denied access to information in any language concerning their history , culture and religion . They are not allowed to gather for cultural seminars or to celebrate national or religious holidays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delete all references of Jewish contributions to Soviet life from the pages of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia . Lately , young Jewish adults have been denied access to major universities and technological institutes . The government has also produced a wave of virulent anti-Semitic propaganda in publications available at low prices throughout the Soviet Union . // In addition , a new official government Anti-Zionist Committee has been established to generate hatred against the State of Israel and to fuel anti-Semitism . This committee falsely states that almost all Jews who desire to emigrate from the Soviet Union have already done so . This is simply not the case . It is true that 51,320 emigrated in 1979 and only 2,688 left in 1982 ? but these figures represent only the number of Jews who were issued visas by the state , not those who wished to leave . The truth is , of the 700,000 Soviet Jews who have received the necessary invitation to come to Israel since the early 1970s , only 250,000 have been allowed to leave , while 450,000 are still awaiting or have been denied visas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more refuseniks and were joined by Richard Day and Donna Alvarado , staff to the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Policy . This time we traveled by private passenger car . Its moonlighting owner , eager to pad his income with taxi fares from foreigners , was openly defying laws against such a " capitalistic " pursuit . The driver told us that within two hours he could collect as much with his " underground " cab as he earned in two days as an engineer . As we exited the cab we waved a cheerful goodbye to the unmarked car that had been following us  --  undoubtedly our KGB shadow  --  and73 entered the home of Aba Taratuta , our host refusenik . In the modest two-room apartment we were joined by 15 other Jews . The word of our visit must have been passed by personal messenger , because the government has disconnected the phones of most of the refuseniks . Aba , a short , amiable , balding man with a goatee , had recently endured a vicious diatribe in the Moscow press , which condemned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13-page article attacked Israel and Zionism and concluded with a description of Aba . It accused him of being a Zionist emissary dedicated to slandering the Soviet Union . Such vilification of individuals in the press often results in misery for the subject 's children at school and for him at the workplace . But this was no problem for Aba and his wife . He , a mathematician , and his wife , a translator , both lost their jobs after applying for an emigration visa ten years ago . It was clear to me that it was difficult for Aba to even step outside his front door for fear of reprisals from neighbors . One young man among those gathered was not a refusenik , but a Jew representing a large number of victims of Soviet anti- Semitism who have not sought to emigrate . He had graduated at the top of his class and during job interviews was consistently encouraged by prospective employers  --  that is , until he was asked to show his internal passport . There , stamped prominently is the word " Evrei , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , employers recanted the existence of any job openings . On his tenth interview , he finally landed a job , but only after conveniently placing his thumb over the word " Evrei " on his passport . Upon discovering his true identity , his new employer attempted to rescind the job offer , but was foiled because government documents had already been signed . It was difficult to match all the names with the stories that evening in Leningrad . Pavel Astrakhan , a young man who desperately tries to observe Jewish customs , told me of his arrest while attempting to visit Babi Yar on the 40th anniversary of the massacre there of thousands of Jews . Yevgeny Lein related the horror story of his year in a Siberian labor camp . He had been sentenced for resisting police when they raided his apartment . Iosif Radomiselsky told me of his attempts to support his parents on his salary from part-time work . Trained as a computer engineer , he was dismissed from his job after applying for a visa . Grigory Genusov described his life in a communal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also told of searches and harassment by the KGB . I left Aba 's apartment that night with a better understanding of the problems of the Soviet Jews as well as a greater appreciation for life in the United States . I was frustrated because I could not answer the refuseniks ' questions : What could the American government do to help them ? When would they ever be allowed to go to their homeland ? I returned to America convinced that we must use the Soviets ' oppressive value system more effectively to pursue our commitment to freedom and human dignity . The Soviets too often gain access to U.S. grain and to cultural and scientific exchanges without making any concessions concerning the psychological brutalization of their peoples . Naive Western appeals for " compassion " and " human rights " do not move the hardened occupants of the Kremlin . Saber-rattling may not change Soviet policy , but reasonable bargaining will , as proven in 1979 when Soviet emigration policies were vastly liberalized for a time . We should attempt to coordinate our Soviet-American trade relations with the efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy . The American business community , which also deals directly with the Soviet government , should be sensitized to the problem . They possess the most leverage we have . I believe we offer the most hope for the thousands of Russians who ache for religious freedom . Six months have passed since my visit to the Soviet Union . The following letter I received recently from a refusenik indicates that conditions are not improving : " Now our situation reminds one of the situation here 30 years ago . It 's as if the ugly and frightening spirit of the ghosts of Stalinism have risen from their graves . I would like to be an optimist , but to my sorrow , there is. . . not even a hint of a positive development , and as to negative signs  --  they are in great quantity . " If we as Americans recoil from solidarity with millions of the oppressed around the world , we must confront the truth that we share the blame for their suffering , and that our waning wills may ultimately assure our own undoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
