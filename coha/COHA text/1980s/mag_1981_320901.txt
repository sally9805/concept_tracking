Chrysler turns up a winner <P> Though the good news of Chrysler 's second quarter results had become one of the worst-kept secrets in automotive history , Chrysler Chairman Lee lacocca was determined to get all the mileage he could out of the announcement . First , he picked the National Press Club in Washington as a forum to give the second quarter company statement the widest possible coverage . Then , at a pre-speech reception , lacocca presided over the presentation of small bottles of artists ' ink to the members of Congress who had voted 19 months ago to give Chrysler up to $1.5 billion in federal loan guarantees . On the bottles of black ink were the labels NOW BEING USED BY THE CHRYSLER CORP . Unable to resist winning a little more publicity for his products , lacocca arrived at the club driving a prototype of a 1982 Chrysler Le Baron convertible in its first appearance on public streets . <P> With all the fanfare complete , lacocca gave out the news : after 27 months and $3.1 billion of losses , Chrysler had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Quipped lacocca : " With our second quarter profits , we too might make a tender offer for Conoco . What the hell , everybody else has . " <P> Although $12 million will not go far in solving Chrysler 's massive financial problems , the small profit represents a significant improvement over last year 's second quarter , when the company lost a stunning $536 million .

Since auto-industry bookkeepers count the cars sold after they are delivered to showrooms , this helped build up the second quarter results . But Chrysler 's auto dealers sold only 189,000 cars , creating a large inventory that could keep down third quarter factory orders . <P> Iacocca insisted that he had not cooked the books . He said that Chrysler prudently built up its stocks so that shortages will not develop later this summer when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also noted that both Ford and General Motors increased stocks during the second quarter . <P> Fancy bookkeeping or not , Chrysler will be hard pressed to stay in the black for the rest of the year . Even though it has sharply reduced the size of its operations and drastically cut costs , the company is headed into the year 's slowest selling season . Sales will also be sluggish if interest rates remain high . lacocca last week predicted a good second half of the year for Chrysler and the rest of the industry if interest rates drop to 15% or less . But he added : " If they stay at 20% , look out-it will be disaster . " <P> The other major auto companies also made money in the second quarter . Ford last week reported a narrow $60 million profit , which was a relief after its $439 million loss in the first quarter of the year . General Motors , the only American automaker to earn money during the first three months of 1981 , is expected to announce even better results for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
