At the start of 1986 , in the 197th year of its existence , the American presidency is a political supernova . Rarely , if ever , has the office attracted so much attention in the nation and the world . <P> White House mail last year increased an astonishing 30% , to 8 million pieces , much of it from children who were somehow inspired  --  or prodded by teachers  --  to ask about the Oval Office and its occupant . <P> College courses on the presidency and the number of students who attend them have grown dramatically . The University of Virginia 's White Burkett Miller Center of Public Affairs , which is oriented toward the presidency , started its scholarly presentations seven years ago with audiences of just under 30 participants and now draws up to 80 . The center is making plans to build a small auditorium for the forums . <P> Harvard 's Roger Porter , wearily grading papers through Christmas night with a flickering TV screen to keep him company , decided about 4 a.m. that the electronic symbol of American power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , it was the Capitol . Indeed , the Soviets , usually a few years behind the times , still use the Capitol as the American symbol on their TV , which may be a clue as to why they have trouble with Ronald Reagan . <P> Michael Robinson , George Washington University 's media scholar , sees a " presidential focus " developing in the mass media . He notes that Franklin Roosevelt was not even quoted at first in some major papers when Germany invaded France in the spring of 1940 . " Today , " says Robinson , " a White House response is the first sought on anything important . It 's changing our political culture . " <P> It is more than just TV , claims the President 's pollster Richard Wirthlin . " Reagan made a difference in people 's lives , " says Wirthlin , whose latest polls show Reagan with 70% approval , 14 points higher than Ike at the same time in his presidency . Wirthlin 's study of overseas opinion shows the same enhancement . <P> The American Enterprise Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholars , journalists and politicians because " it became apparent that it was not inevitable every President was going to be a failed President . " Not so long ago academics had suggested the institution was flawed . <P> Sales of this year 's White House Christmas tree ornament  --  profiles of James and Dolley Madison  --  by the White House Historical Association set a new record , 26,500 at $9.75 a bauble . Sheila Tate , who used to be Nancy Reagan 's press secretary , was told that during the second term interest in the First Family would begin to decline . " It never happened , " she said . Bill Henkel , the White House advance director for three Presidents who in other years used to have to work hard to get crowds , now just has to let people know where Reagan will be and there is instant enthusiasm . Requests for presidential appearances are running at a staggering 100 to 200 a day , and the Reagan schedulers are braced for more pleas . <P> Curator Clem Conger , who has lovingly guided the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mansion never looked better , nor has there ever been so much interest in its history . There will soon be two new volumes on just that subject , part of the flood tide of material on the presidency .
