c'ol AMONG THE FREAKSc ) , by Lewis Nordan GOO KNEW I had made a mistake when the iced tea came with a spoon sticking out of it . I was in the Skelly truck stop restaurant in Alma , Arkan- sas . It 's got a sign that says HOME COOKING and a glass case full of slabs of coconut pie and chocolate pie with real dilapidated meringue on them and a couple of flies crawling around on the inside of the glass . Meringue and flies do n't mean a thing compared with tea . You can scoop that meringue off and sling it up under some furniture and never see it again , and there 's not a nickel 's worth of taste in a fly , even if you do happen to eat one . It 's the iced tea in a place that predicts what the food is going to look like when it comes out . I learned that from my mama , who served instant potato sandwiches on light bread . She also pronounced meringue as merry-gew , if you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , I 've got to tell you about my mama . She used to cut a magnolia blossom off the tree in our side yard and put it on the dining room table for decoration . " Big as a dinner plate , " she would always say , which made it sound kind of sickening in the first place , if you see what I mean . It was so sweet-smelling it would give you cavities . Not really , of course . That was my grandmama 's joke , Sugar Mecklin . I wanted to live with Sugar , but nobody would let me . The magnolia would n't cause cavities , but it would give you Excedrin Headache Number 57 , if you remember your TV commercials at all , before you could jerk a cat in two . That 's the one where two goats are butting each other in the head . The worst thing was she would leave it on the table so long . She would leave it there a month , seemed like . She would leave it there until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw it out . Even if she 'd been a better cook you could n't have eaten in the presence of that magnolia . Lewis Nordan fives and works in Arkansas . Nobody could . My daddy could , of course . But not any normal person , no way , Jose , which is something else my grandmama Sugar used to say . I took one look at that tea and I said , " Instant ! " right out loud . Could n't have stopped myself if I tried . Some customers looked over at me . I said , " Instant , " another couple of times real loud , and clapped my hands together when I said it . They might think instant means waitress in German or some other language , you do n't know . You 're going to say , " Now he sounds a little crazy to me , " and I do n't blame you a bit . I am crazy , I act that way . I start acting crazy whenever I 'm under the influence of Winston Krepps . Winston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's a full-time quadriplegic , got him a motorized wheelchair and everything . I was supposed to meet Winston at this truck stop and help his attendant drive him out to west Oklahoma to some kind of conference he was going to . Winston jumped off a bridge when he was a boy and hit a submerged boat , broke his neck pretty as you please . I said , " I bet you wo n't be jumping off any more bridges anytime soon , will you , " and Winston said he had to agree . He said he learned his lesson the first time . I lived with Winston for a while a couple years ago , helped him out . He says I ought to get a more realistic view of life , and other helpful advice . I have to agree . I get along fine with Winston . The trouble is , I 've got this personality flaw . That 's what Winston told me . I 'm ashamed to tell you about it , but here 's the truth . Funny-looking people make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Uh-oh , look out , he 's a mean one . " It 's not true . Winston 'll tell you that himself .

Twenty-four years old , high school equivalency diploma  --  I mean what else do you want , Burt Reynolds , or what ? i ?  --  ( ; (  --  But I never can treat crippled people like they 're real . To me they 're just a bunch of freaks , not much better than a midget . And do n't get me started on the blind . I took work out at the School for the Blind in Little Rock for a while , so I know what 's on a blind man 's mind . They 've got this good sense of smell , though , give them that . Anyway , it 's a problem I 've got . Winston says it does n't matter to him , he likes me anyway , which I appreciate . Part of the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Safeway , squeezing canteloupes , look out ! ? somebody 's going to sneak up behind you and hand you a deaf-mute card and cost you a quarter and make you think for about the one-millionth time that you might try to learn sign language off the hand illustrations on the back . Or you 're down at Roger 's Ozark Pool Hall , shooting a little snooker , hold on ! ? here comes a man with one leg shorter than the other and he 's wearing one of those built-up shoes , rocking his way around the table , rocka rocka rocka , while he chalks his cue and takes you for every nickel you got in your pocket . How are you going to shoot snooker with a rocker ? I went out with a girl one time who showed me a glass eye she wore around her neck on a gold chain . I never asked her whose eye it was , I just drove her home . I counted myself lucky I had n't made a big hit with her . Think about taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at you . What kind of life can you live when you keep meeting people who might do that to you ? And you try applying for a job in Fort Smith , second largest town in . Arkansas . Just try it and see what happens . A third of the men you shake hands with will have two fingers missing on their right hand , and the rest of them will be wearing a hearing aid . They wear those flesh-colored rascals that fit behind your ear and look like you 've got a disease . I ca n't stand a hearing aid . One of those big curved horns you used to see in pictures would be all right , but not something that looks like ear disease . Deformed people are attracted to me , see . I 'm a lightning rod and they 're a big dark cloud just rubbing his old hands together , he 's so happy . Wait till I tell you what happened to me when I was a child growing up in Mississippi . A pipeline for natural gas was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lot of new work opened up . Transient workers from all over the country piled into our little town in trailers . My daddy , trying to latch on to some of the new money that was flowing through , rented out our side yard with the magnolia tree . It was a good place for a mobile-home hookup , he said . You probably already know what happened . A family of midgets moved in . You would n't think there would be many midgets in the construeLion field , would you . But there they were , a whole trailerful of them . I USED to be Winston 's attendant . That 's the kind of job I 'm always getting myself into . I lived with him for about six months before he moved to Hot Springs to teach in the Rehab Center there . He 's a poet , and they tell me he understands the problems of the handicapped and is well appreciated for his good work . I do n't doubt it a bit . Here 's the thing , though . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I was living with him I had this unhealthy compulsion to be the best attendant the world has ever known . Winston says I ought to try to break myself of that . He says I 'm just a generous kind of guy and I take everything too far , even generosity . I did n't catch on to what I was doing at the time , but I think I see it now . I would do anything in the world that Winston told me , and I mean anything . My goal was to give Winston the freedom to do anything he would have done if he never had jumped off that bridge in the first place . He said , " Okay , what if I told you I could n't stand you ? What if I said I 'd shoot you dead if I could hold a gun and pull the trigger ? " I swear , it scared me . I did n't know the answer . I knew it would n't come to that . Winston would n't do that to me . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to know the answer to . I did plenty of other stuff though . If Winston was dead drunk and wanted more whiskey , I poured it down him , brother , no questions asked , forget about tomorrow . Next day he 'd be sick and I 'd be holding the pan he was gagging into and he 'd catch his breath for a second and he 'd say , " Use your goddamn brain , man ! Do n't feed a drunk man whiskey ! " Too late , and just do n't tell me to do it again . That 's what I would think , I would n't say it . I make it a rule never to disagree with a freak . If he wanted to blow the horn in traffic , I blew it , forget about rude , forget about unnecessary . If Winston wanted to stay late at a party that everybody else had already left and the host wanted us the hell out of his house , we stayed . " Christ , do n't let me do that again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened . Same thing  --  do n't ask it again . Plenty of times I drove down roads I knew were the wrong road , because Winston had misread the map . I made wrong turns into one-way traffic because Winston had his directions mixed up . I understand it better now . Winston explained it to me . He said it was a way of redressing the wrong in myself , what I knew was wrong . He said I felt guilty for thinking he was n't real , He said I was trying to act like he , Winston , was the real person and that I was the one that was something else , something less . He said it would suit him fine if I was to disagree with him sometime . He said it would beat hell out of driving into one-way traffic . It did n't help . I still do whatever a freak tells me . When I 'm under the influence of Winston , even non-freaks can control me . Like the tea , for example . I ca n't stand instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever want to meet up with , used to make instant tea when I was little . They say the product has been improved since then but it 's a lie , it 's the same . My mama was n't deformed , but she was a kind of freak . My daddy actually called her a freak one time , right to my face . We were sitting out on the porch swing and Daddy was shooting out the Christmas lights around the porch , still up in August , with a Red Ryder BB gun , manufactured at the plant right out here in Springdale , with a leather thong hanging off the side . He said , right out of the clear blue , like when a daddy decides his boy ought to be told some important thing that he 'll need to know about for the rest of his life , like about tail or something , he said , " Sugar , your mama is a first-class freak . It has not escaped my attention . " What 's a child going to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was telling me he loved my mother . He might just as well have said , " I have been cursed with premature ejaculation , but I love family life anyway . " What 's a child supposed to say ? What 's he supposed to think about for the rest of his life ? And anyway , who arranged for the midgets to live in the side yard with the magnolia tree ? Not Mama . I remember she did introduce me to a clubfooted Latvian girl , and she kept giving us that look that says she 's just dying for us to like each other right away and get married and have her a passel of little clubfooted Latvian grandchildren but she does n't want to seem pushy so just go right on and take our time . I KNEW I was going to drink that tea the minute I saw it . I caught a couple of flies with my hand , just to calm down . I took the tea from the waitress and said , " Donkey shane , honey . " I was using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt . The reason was , this waitress had a mean look . She was old and had heavy biceps and old-fashioned heart-shaped lips painted over her regular lips . I did n't look to see if she had her stockings rolled down to her ankles or was wearing white socks , but I bet it was one or the other . She was n't wearing any kind of waitress uniform , just a plain blue dress with a broad collar . She looked like somebody who was having to work on her day off . so just watchout . Jack , do n't mess with her . I was n't wrong about the tea . I looked down in the glass . There was a solid brown mass at the bottom . I pushed it around and around until it broke up and an amber foam floated up to the top . Presweetened and lemon flavored , same as Mama used to make , you could smell it . And I was n't wrong about the food either . It was as bad as Mama 's . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The scariest meal she fixed was spaghetti . The recipe was real simple . For the sauce she dumped a couple of quarts of canned tomatoes into a big skillet , along with an onion chopped into four pieces . That was all . There were no other ingredients . No garlic , no salt , no meat , no oregano  --  nothing . Listen to this . When the tomatoes were bubbling , she stripped the cellophane off a package of noodles and , without separating them , jammed them up under the hot tomatoes like a short baton . They just sat there and cooked until they were a solid gummy rod of pasta . My daddy , he was a little red-faced man with webbed toes on both his feet and went around barefoot all the time . He claimed this was his favorite dish . He would clean his plate . I mean he really liked it , he was n't just being nice . He 'd finish up and he 'd say , " Whew ! " He 'd push his chair back from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old duck toes hanging off the end , and he 'd pat his stomach with both hands . He 'd say , " I ought not , I 'm going to get fat if I do , but , honey , if you 'd be kind enough to slice me off another three . four inches of that spaghetti , I do believe I could find a place for it . " Do you see what I mean ? It 's no wonder I 've got some personality problems . I played it safe with the waitress . I wrapped the Salisbury steak up in a paper napkin and stuffed it inside the torn plastic lining of the chair I was sitting in . I let the mashed potatoes get cold and stiff enough to stick to the underside of the table . I hoped they would hang there long enough for me to make my getaway . I did n't know what to do with the cole slaw , so I scooped it up in the palm of my hand and looked around the room . When I thought nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody was sitting at the table , and the dishes from the last customer had n't been bused yet . I had hoped it would hit one of the plates , but it did n't . It looked okay where it did hit , though , mostly in one of the ashtrays . When the waitress brought the check , she noticed I had cleaned my plate . For a second there I thought she was going to tell me what a good boy I was , but she did n't . She just gave me one of her suspicious looks and slapped the check down in front of me . I think I know why she was mad at me . I got the impression she could tell I hitchhiked in HARPERS/JUNE. 1982 ? - 220. : -C ) SIC ) - C ) . Q C ; 1- r here . I got the impression she knew I had caught two rides to get here , the first one to Winslow with a college boy in a 280Z and the other one with a man in a twenty-five-year-old Cadillac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was driving to Waco to kill his brother-in-law and showed me the pistol he was going to use . I got the impression she ? was thinking , You 're batting .500 already , sonny-boy , do n't try nothing smart with me . I got the impression hitchhikers are on an especially low rung of the social ladder in a truck stop , especially those who ca n't do any better than an Arky college boy and a murderous Texan . She did n't say a word about it , but I 've got this ability . Just then Winston and his attendant drove up . The attendant 's name was Floyd , Winston had told me on the phone . I recognized the van right away when I saw it out the window . It 's a white Ford with a hydraulic lift on the back . I thought about Winston and remembered he would be in his old heavy humming buzzing chair . I could n't stand that thing . Old Biceps looked in my direction from the next table . She had found the ashtray full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I checked the mashed potatoes and thought they had started to lose their grip . I eased away from the table and went outside to the parking lot to meet Winston and Floyd . I did n't know Floyd , just his name , which sounded a little sissified to me , if you want the truth . The waitress was still busy with the slaw problem and did n't see me leave . N OW HERE IS the way things can turn on you . I had been worrying about dealing with Winston 's being a freak . There was a bigger problem with Floyd . He was n't the pretty-boy I had expected . In fact , he was extra ugly . He was ugly enough to qualify for a full-time freak , if you ask me . Sugar Mecklin would have said he was ugly enough to strike you blind . I shook hands with him out in the parking lot and went blind . It 's the truth . He was there , 1 just could n't see him . The only thing I noticed about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black man . I would n't want you to think I 'm prejudiced against 0 black people . You might think so , since you know I grew up , in Mississippi . But it 's not true . In fact , I grew up thinking my family was part Negro . My grandmama Sugar told me ever since I can remember that she was one quarter black . She 'd say , " One quarter black , and it had to be the hind quarter . " Her right leg and hip were n't black exactly , they were more purple . It was a birthmark , I guess . I do n't know what age I was before I finally caught on that she was making a joke . I used to roll around on the linoleum floor of her kitchen and try to look up Sugar 's dress to see how high her blackness went . She 'd kick me away from the sink , real playful , and she 'd say , " You little freak . " Anyway , Floyd was black and I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't there . It turned out , though . that I was n't blind after all . Floyd was invisible . I could see everything around him . I saw the parked tractor trailers , I saw the greasy asphalt and the diesel pumps . I could see Winston just fine . He looked all right , too , as good as he ever looks . But Floyd was n't there . He was too ugly to be seen . w INS TON SAID that before he ate he wanted to be taken into the souvenir section of the truck stop . He said he was collecting material for a poem . I knew what he wanted to look at . He wanted to look at the Bowie knives and billy clubs and Confederate flags and bumper stickers that say I JUST BARFED and I 'M GLAD and oil paintings of Jesus riding shotgun in a Kenworth hauling logs . Floyd said , " Nah , we do n't have time . " Do you think I 'd ever say such a thing to Winston ? Winston said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Floyd would n't do it . Floyd said , " What you want me to get you to eat ? " Winston dropped the subject of the souvenirs and rolled into the restaurant . He said , " I believe I 'll have a beer . " Floyd said , " You do n't want any beer . " I thought , I like Floyd pretty good , invisible or not . It was an odd thing to be thinking , if you see what I mean . A I.I . DURING the meal I spoke with this exaggerated British accent . It tickled Winston and Floyd to death , but I was serious . You ca n't go into a restaurant with a pair of freaks and not do something to protect yourself . I used words like bloody good and old chap and amusing . Partly it was to throw the waitress off my trail . We had Lady Biceps again , and I did n't know whether she had found the Salisbury steak or not . The funny part is , she did n't recognize me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody , but with her it was working perfect . She looked at me like I was n't there at all . She could see Floyd just fine , you could tell , but she could n't see me . It scared me a little , to tell the truth , even though I always thought it would be kind of nice to be invisible . One time I paid a woman at a carnival five dollars to make me invisible , and do you think she would do it ? Why , no . She tried to give me the five dollars back . She said I reminded her of her poor little sweet . o -o , ? o I o , ? C ) - o Q- - G- nephew who was a harelip ( which I 'm not ) and why did n't I just run along and spend my money on something else . I said , " Uh-unh , honey , we made a deal . I got a signed contract . " She said , " I ai n't a real gypsy . I was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You scat . " You talk about mad , that was me . I tore that contract up right in her sassy face . Her name was Sister Medium Jackson , and she could have done it , too , if she 'd tried . Right now I had this waitress problem . I made some squawking and hooting noises at her , like jungle birds and monkeys . I stretched out the features of my face with my fingers . It did n't faze her a bit . She did n't bat an eye . She was n't faking either . She did n't give me that look that says she really does see me and she knows what a bratty little jackass am and would n't my mama be ashamed of me if she knew the kind of fool I 'm playing in a public place but just you wait and see how long it takes her to bat an eye she does n't care how crazy I act . That was n't her . She really could n't see me , just like I could n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracked up to be . I thought Sister Medium Jackson was a pretty nice old girl after all , back in that sawdusty old horse lot they called a carnival in Mississippi , trying to save me five dollars and a hard time . But mostly I felt all alone and left out . I hated being invisible , even to just one person . I felt awful that I had probably made Floyd feel the same way . I looked at him again and hoped I 'd be able to see him , but I could n't . Still invisible . These are strange times we are living in , I 'm telling you . I wanted out of the Skelly station . I kept looking at the black hole of Floyd , trying to see him in there somewhere , peeking out or something . The blackness did n't have anything to do with his race . Floyd was like watching an eclipse of the moon , except there was no light around the rim . I wondered if anybody who could be invisible could be real , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a blackness of Floyd 's not being there . It was like he was too much there , like a real black hole in space you hear so much about , like he 's pure there , not like most everybody else , who are only half-assed here . I said , " I 've got to get out of here . I 'm going crazy . " Winston and Floyd said they had to agree . HE DRIVE to Oklahoma was long and hard , but I did n't mind . I was happy to be in the van , behind the wheel . Sometimes cars would pass us , and one time a child in the backseat caught a glimpse of Floyd and had a conniption fit and his mama and daddy probably wondered what in the world , but mostly nobody even looked . We drove until it got dark , and we kept on driving . It was real late . The traffic through Oklahoma City was fierce . Every cowboy and Indian in the state was out driving around in pickups . We kept on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for gas . It was the middle of the night by now , and the station we stopped at was deserted except for us . We pulled ? up alongside the pumps and I saw the station attendant come out of the little lighted office and head our way . He was just a boy . I could see that his name was sewn on his shirt , up over the Exxon patch , but I did n't read it . I knew his name already . I have this mental ability . His name would be Jimmy , and his last name would be Fish . I looked around for his daddy , whose name would be Ellis , then I realized his daddy would n't be working in a service station . He would be assistant manager of the planing mill . Jimmy Fish was in his late teens . He was a skinny boy with a big Adam 's apple and pretty good teeth . He looked tired and friendly . I watched him come up to the van on Floyd 's side . Floyd turned toward him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing . One time when I was Jimmy Fish 's age , I had a temporary job in the complaint department of a big store . It was the day after Christmas and I was making exchanges on Christmas presents that were being brought back . It was a pretty good job , too , tissue paper in your hands all day and the smell of cardboard in your nostrils . Where are you going to get a better job than that ? I was sitting framed behind an open window at a counter . I waited on a long line of polite dissatisfied customers . Look up , smile , inspect the merchandise , do the paper work , look up again , next customer . Nothing to it . Then I looked up into the face of a monster . It was a woman with no face . There was no nose , only a wet hole to breathe through . There were no lips , only teeth . There was a wild caged tongue that was roaring for freedom from behind its bars . There was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other eye was sealed shut . There was no hair , only a badly fitted wig that could n't hide the fact that she did n't have any ears . There were sermons that might have been preached on that good woman 's suffering . No sermons came to my mind , I screamed . A loud , horrible , out-of-control scream . Everybody in the line of customers hated me for noticing her deformity . The store manager sent me home . People comforted the monster , who could n't cry because her tear glands had been blown away in the explosion along with everything else . I was not proud of that scream . I expected Jimmy Fish to scream like that when he saw Floyd . I was wrong . Do you know what ? , ? ; : / C ) . ? 0- - G- Jimmy Fish said ? He said , " Unleaded ? " I wanted to be like Jimmy Fish . I wanted to be anybody but myself . I wanted to blame my crazy mania and daddy for making me so crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't . Blame had never seemed so out of place . I looked at Floyd and hoped I might be able to see him . I thought if I could see him I would n't hate myself so much . He was still invisible , but he had changed . A dim halo had formed around his eclipsed face , his eclipsed self . I looked at Jimmy Fish . I admired him . I admired his innocence . I admired him for never having lived in Mississippi with a yardful of midgets . I admired these dark Oklahoma plains . I loved the people of this moony land . I knew that nobody in Oklahoma would ever scream into a woman 's face , no matter how ugly she was . I stopped myself . I made a couple of jungle noises , to test the air . I placed my right hand inside my shirt , in my armpit , and blew off a couple of quick bilabials . It was love . Love is what I was up against . I fought it . I resisted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of the night and you think he reminds you of yourself and yet you know he represents everything you could never have been because you had midgets and he did n't and you were once invisible and he was n't and you could n't see Floyd and had screamed in a woman 's face and learned to eat spaghetti by the slice . I resisted loving anyone for the reason that he was not deformed and that his family was not crazy and that he fit , anyway , into a world of deformity better than I did . I looked out the window on my side of the van . The boy was pumping gas . I made a sound like a siren at him , and he only looked up and smiled . He made small talk . He told me about a man he saw on " Real People , " the TV show , who called himself the Human Siren . I barked at him and snarled at him , and he started telling me the plot of a werewolf movie . I loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I resisted love because I knew that Jimmy Fish was not the thing I loved . The love I felt had no object . It was flying loose everywhere in a whirlwind , it had no place to light . Jimmy Fish was the first ? scrap of bark it came to and clung to by its toenails . I remembered a time when my mama invited the midgets into our home for dinner . She served them her unbelievable spaghetti . The midgets thought a cruel joke was being played on them . The father of the little family took a deep breath . He got up , with dignity , from his chair . He jerked the napkin back through the napkin ring and put it beside his plate . He said , " We will go now . I understand now . " With his tiny wife and three midget children squeaking and peeping and cheep-ing behind him , he made his lofty exit and never entered our home again . I was a child at that table . I felt as embarrassed and as alone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house by the back door . I hid in the ditch under the chinaberry tree and watched them . I dreamed of finding words to apologize to them . I never did . I could never bring myself to speak to any of them again . The pipeline was finished and they moved out of our yard . Winston told me I was on a Journey Through the Land of the Flat Characters . I know what he means now . When Jimmy Fish did not scream , love swept through me like a sudden wind . I resisted love , I clawed at it , I scratched it with my fingernails , I bit off its nose . But it was still there . It felt like the breeze made by the wings of a million bats swarming up out of a cave , squealing . I thought I was one of the bats in the swarm . This was love to me . Behind us a million tons of bat shit on the floor of the cave , and all around us nothing but a blaze of starlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our pained ears like a million tiny white canes with red tips tap-tap-tapping along a sidewalk looking for the curb . I was in love , but not with Jimmy or Winston or Floyd or myself . I was in love with America . The love I felt  --  crazy , diffuse , bat-out-of-hell love  --  was patriotism . I loved America . I loved Exxon . I loved the Ford Motor Company , which built the van that brought me to Oklahoma and this insight . I loved America 's golden indifference to deformity . I loved American parents , who could name the ugliest child to be born in modern times with a pretty-boy 's name . I loved American consumers , who hated me for screaming at a monster . I loved American politicians , who treated Floyd to a free education at the Rehabilitation Center Trade School for the simple reason that he was ugly as hell and had applied for a scholarship on those grounds .

" I said , " Floyd , I am proud to be an American ! " Winston looked at me , and then at Floyd . They both seemed worried about me . Winston said , " We 're all tired . We 're all getting punchy . " I tried to curb my enthusiasm . They were probably right . I probably did sound a little wild . I went inside the station and gave Jimmy Fish Winston 's credit card . I said , " Fine night , Jimmy , just fine ! " Jimmy did n't say anything . I was sorry I had had to make the noises at him , happy he had not seemed to notice . I wanted to ask about Ellis , but I decided against it . Maybe people in Oklahoma are n't named Ellis . Maybe there are no planing mills in Oklahoma . Jimmy Fish handed me the credit slip to sign . He said , " Write down your tag number . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the block marked STATE . He took the slip and read it over , real careful . I was afraid he would know I was lying about the license number . He did n't care about the number . He said , " Arkansas , " reading from the slip . His voice did n't have much expression . He did n't hand back the credit card or my copy of the bill yet . He said , " Whereabouts in Arkansas . " I said , " Hot Springs . " Not much of a lie . He said , " My granddaddy used to live in Ar-kansas . " I said , " Is that right . " He said , " Yep . " I took the credit card from him and slipped it into my shirt pocket . He held on to the charge slip . He wanted to read " Arkansas " a little longer . I said , " Well ... " I shifted to the other foot . I said , " Time to get back on the road . " He said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your granddaddy . I see . Texarkana . " He said , " He 's dead now . " I said , " I 'm sorry to hear it , " and put my hand on the doorknob . I did n't need the receipt slip . And yet when I tried to leave , I could n't . I looked at the boy , whose name might not have been Jimmy Fish at all . He seemed even younger than before . My patriotism was gone , it seemed silly now . I felt very calm , and I began to see this boy in a way I had not been able to see before . He looked human to me for the first time . I thought , maybe it was not just freaks I saw as less than human . Maybe it was everybody . He said , " He died last weekend . " For some reason I had thought his grandfather had been dead much longer . I did n't answer right away . I said , " Just this last weekend . " This time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you able to get over for the funeral ? " He said , " They did n't have a funeral . " I did n't know what to say . His grandfather had been left unburied for a full week . The boy said , " His house burned down on him . Mama 's still hunting bones . " He handed me my receipt . He said , " Mama said no use burying him till we 've got the whole thing , " I let a second or two pass . I said . " What 's your granddaddy 's name , Jimmy ? " I was n't reading his shirt . I said , " What did people call your granddaddy ? " He said , " Ellis . " I said , " Nice talking to you , " and walked back out to the van . F LOYD was sitting in the shotgun seat ready to go . Winston was still in place in his chair . 1 remembered something about my grand-mama Sugar . In the last two weeks of her life , she believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belts , was camped in her bedroom . She thought they were playing cards and gambling at the foot of her bed at night . The day before she died she called me to her bed . She said , " They 're not really there , Sugar . Do n't pay any more attention to them than you have to . " I said . " All right , Sugar . " She said , " Muldrow was my youngest brother . You never knew him . He got a brain tumor and went blind and could n't see anything but the inside of farm-implement companies . " I said , " All right , Sugar , you rest now . " She said , " It 's the same with these midget banditos . They 're not here either . No more than Muldrow 's tractors and disks and haymows . " I said , " You rest . " She said , " Nothing is real . " She said , " Nothing you see is ever really there . " I said , " All right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice was tolerant and loving . She said , " They 're cute little buggers , but you ca n't understand a blessed word they say . " I GOT IN the driver 's seat . I said , " Winston , this is a long drive . " Winston said , " We 're almost there . " I looked over at Floyd . The eclipse had passed . I could see him now , quite clearly . I said , " Floyd , how about you driving for a while . " Winston said , " I want you to drive , Sugar . You 're a much better driver than Floyd . " I started up the engine . Floyd got out and walked around to my side anyway . He stood outside the window . I said , " It 's okay , Floyd , I 'll drive . " He said . " You start letting a cripple push you around , you 're going to have a problem . " I looked out of the car at Jimmy Fish , where he stood in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of loneliness . Winston said , " Sugar , you start letting a cripple and a man as ugly as Floyd push you around , you 've got a bigger problem . " They were right . It was time . I let Floyd slip behind the wheel and we pulled out . I wished we could take Jimmy Fish with us . I know he wanted to go . But there was no way it could be done . Sugar Mecklin was not right about one thing , though , my grandmama . People are really there , every one of them . They definitely are . I swear , these are strange times we are living in. ?
