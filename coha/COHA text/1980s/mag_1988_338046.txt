While the rest of baseball was settling into the season , the Baltimore Orioles were spinning out of the way , reeling from inside pitches too mean to be believed , looking silly and sad . Starting with a 12-0 opener at home , the Orioles lost the first six games for second-year Manager Cal Ripken , who was abruptly fired . Frank Robinson replaced him , and they lost ten more to shatter an 84-year-old major-league record . Once Baltimore was the proudest team in the game , and the winningest . <P> Since the start of divisional play in 1969 , even counting the two woeful seasons past , the Orioles have won 45 more games than the fabled Yankees , 63 and 51 more than the Dodgers and Reds . And how  --  not how many  --  was the real distinction . In the front office and on the field , Baltimore played the game smartly , happily and hard and , from 1966 on , to win titles . That was the year Robinson first came over from Cincinnati to show them how . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , known as a lethal base runner and horrible loser , Robinson was considered a little volatile . One famous night at a diner , he showed a pistol to a quarrelsome cook who was directing Robinson 's attention to a meat cleaver . The lithe outfielder  --  marked down as " an old 30 " by Cincinnati management  --  was dispatched to Baltimore , where that watershed summer he hit .316 with 122 runs batted in and 49 homers , not including the one that won the Orioles ' first World Series . Over the five prosperous seasons that followed , his competitive values became imprinted in the Baltimore clubhouse , and they heralded his selection as the big leagues ' first black manager in 1975 . <P> Robinson was handed the worst team that came along , the Cleveland Indians , and made it respectable . But he was still considered a little volatile . While a player-manager , he socked a Toledo Mud Hens pitcher , who , upset at having been cut by Robinson , nearly beaned him in an exhibition game . Fired within three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1982 he managed the languorous Giants into the last week of a pennant race . This time , snatching an occasional jersey in anger , he lasted only slightly longer . The word was that Robinson could not communicate with the modern ballplayers . " I communicate with them , " he said . " I just tell them things they do n't want to hear . " The whispers were that he was especially harsh with the blacks . <P> " Deep down inside , " says Joe Morgan , the black second baseman whose splendid career wound down with the Robinson Giants , " I think it 's true that he was hoping for and expecting more from us . We all like to say we give 100% , but a baseball player can always take another step somewhere along the line . The black players were n't fair to him in Cleveland ; I 'll leave it at that . And ! some of our guys let him down too , if you want to know the truth of it . When I heard about the Baltimore job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to say , ' Congratulations  --  I think .
