A T &; Treacts to a billion-dollar telecommunications shake-up <P> When it comes to go-getter companies for the 1980s , the name Ma Bell does not leap readily to mind . For years the world 's largest business enterprise , with assets of more than $114 billion , has also been one of the dullest . Its deserved reputation is that of a lumbering pachyderm , content with its status as a Government-protected monopoly that controls 83% of the U.S. telephone market . <P> That situation is now changing , and fast . Regulatory reform in Washington and the breakneck advances of computer technology have conspired to create a far-reaching shake-up in the U.S. 's $100 billion-a-year telecommunications industry . This will probably mean big markets as well as potentially huge problems for A T &; T. <P> On the one hand , the company 's privileged monopoly status is under attack in the courts by the Justice Department as well as some 37 private companies , which are pressing their own antitrust suits against Bell . In June , upstart little MCI of Washington , D.C. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1.8 billion in damages from a federal court in Chicago after charging that A T &; T had conspired to block its entry into the long-distance telephone market . Now MCI is selling its phone service in such leading markets as New York City , Houston and San Diego . The company 's brashly imitative advertising campaign tells customers to " reach out and touch someone . But do it for half of what Bell charges . " Meanwhile , ITT , Western Union and even the parent corporation of the Southern Pacific railroad have started up similar operations . <P> More unsettling still for Bell , Congress currently has bills before it that will loosen up regulation throughout the entire industry and invite even more competition . In fact , companies such as General Telephone &; Electronics and ITT are already challenging AT &T's; dominance over phone equipment by selling telephones themselves , as are a host of smaller firms that have been cranking out toylike phone gadgets that look like beer cans , Mickey Mouse and Superman . The devices connect right up to the Bell lines in homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,800 PhoneCenter retail outlets around the country , which offer an equally broad array telephone designs to customers . <P> Yet even as the company 's competitors multiply , new and enticing opportunities for A T &; T are proliferating elsewhere . The most promising field is microcomputer electronics-that arcane world where the telephone meets the computer . <P> Until now , Bell has been blocked from moving full force into the lucrative new market of data communications , in which information is transferred directly from one computer to another , thereby eliminating , among other things , the need for companies to shuffle bulky reels of electronic tape back and forth between offices by mail or messenger service . But in April the Federal Communications Commission ruled that the restriction was stifling the growth of the entire communications industry . Thus the FCC declared that the company could start offering just about any sort of computer-based telephone service it wished .
