Two men calmly walked into the Restaurant Basque in Madrid last week , strode toward a table of legislators slated to take seats at the parliament 's opening the next morning and opened fire . One diner was killed , another badly wounded . As the gunmen left the restaurant , they told a security guard nearby that all was well , then disappeared down a dark street . <P> Both victims , who were moderate members of the Basque separatist group Herri Batasuna , had hoped that ending their party 's ten-year boycott of the parliament would spur negotiations with Madrid to redress Basque grievances . As news of the murders spread , thousands of Basques went into the streets of Bilbao , San Sebastian and other cities , smashing windows and burning buses and cars . <P> The style of the attack , the weapons used and other details suggested that ultrarightists , perhaps with ties to the army , were involved . The far right opposes the Socialist government 's attempt to improve relations with the Basques .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
