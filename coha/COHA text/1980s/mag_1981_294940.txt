Taxes , Taxes <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> In your story " The Biggest Challenge " Jan. 19 , Lester C. Thurow , a member of the TIME Board of Economists , criticizes the Kemp-Roth tax cuts . He says " the average American saves 4% of his income and consumes 96% . " He does n't mention that the Government takes 30% of the middle-class income , leaving the remainder to be consumed by the banks for mortgages , the oilman for heat , the utilities , not to mention the grocery store , clothes , doctor or dentist . We have federal tax , state tax , Social Security tax , school tax , town tax , gas tax , sales tax . Would n't it be great if the Government could save 4% instead of ending with a budget deficit of $30 billion ? <P> Connie Burkart Averill Park . N.Y . <P> <P> There is a simple solution to the dilemma of cutting taxes while persuading Americans to save at the same time . The Federal Government should grant a tax cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their tax savings in a special , restricted , three-year certificate of deposit . In the short term , the savings could stimulate business investment without creating additional inflation . <P> Terry Bedwell Citrus Heights , Calif . <P> Here we go again ; the military becomes the whipping boy . Your article on economics said , " The Government funnels tax money collected from business and workers to people who consume but do not produce : for example , military retirees or welfare recipients . " Let 's get one thing straight , I worked for the retirement pay I receive . I lived on starvation wages during a naval career , put in thousands of hours of overtime for no extra money and agreed to lay my life on the line for this nation . I earned every cent . You have received this man 's production . <P> Ervin J. Halvorson , U.S.N. ( ret . ) Sioux Falls , S.

I spent many an hour poring over the pictures of the naked women in Africa and the South Sea Islands in National Geographic , and many a Sunday morning at church service engrossed in the erotic poetry and stories of lust , adultery , homosexuality , murder and incest in the Old Testament . <P> Lynne Davis Hewitt , Texas <P> If the books in question were filmed in their entirety , which of them could be shown on television ? Which of them could my youngsters view at the theater without my consent ? Why is it suddenly censorship when the public declines to put them into the hands of their children at school or library ? <P> Ken Buchanan Grass Valley , Calif . <P> <P> J.F.K. Casket <P> Author Lifton , who you say thinks someone stole President Kennedy 's body and created the bullet hole in the back of his neck Jan. 19 , is apparently unaware that the anesthetist , Dr. Marion Jenkins , at Parkland Hospital in Dallas had found the bullet hole in the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corresponding exit wound on the front of his throat . <P> Mr. Lifton also has obviously never tried to remove a brain . Nor has he cut it up to find bullet fragments and then made it go back into the skull so that no one could tell the organ had been removed . You just ca n't do it .
