The officials said earlier this week that the White House asked Mr. Baker to review a draft of a speech that the aide , Robert M. Gates , was scheduled to give this evening to the National Collegiate Security Conference in Bethesda , Md. , a student colloquium. // The Administration does not wish to appear to want to hasten the Soviet leader ' s demise with self-fulfulling prophecies or being overly naive about the opportunities Mr. Gorbachev may be presenting . To maintain a consistent voice and policy , Secretary Baker has recently taken a more active role as the Administration ' s foreign-policy spokesman. #2 Drafts of Speech Rejected It is unusual for a Secretary of State to intervene to block the speech of another senior Administration official . The move reflects the caution with which the Administration discusses Mr. Gorbachev at this time of rapid change , when there are conflicting perceptions about what is happening in the Soviet Union and how the United States should respond. // Mr. Baker ' s Policy Planning staff and European Affairs division were adamantly opposed to the address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong signal at a time when the United States and Soviet Union are moving toward broader dialogue on a variety of fronts . Mr. Baker agreed with their assessment , officials said. // After the State Department sent back his first draft , Mr. Gates revised it in a way he hoped would be acceptable to the Secretary of State and sent it back . The second draft was also found wanting , officials said . <> <> Problem Is Denied // On Wednesday , Mr. Baker spoke to the national security adviser , Brent Scowcroft , Mr. Gates ' s immediate superior , and said he thought that it would best that the speech not be delivered . Mr. Scowcroft acceded to the request , the officials said . Mr. Baker did not speak directly to Mr. Gates. // " There are no and never have been any personal problems between Bob Gates and Jim Baker , " said an Administration official . " Baker just felt that there were some lines in that speech that could be misinterpreted and seized upon by the press that could make it appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , or create the perception of differences where they do not exist . Considering that Baker has just given these two speeches about the Administration ' s position on U.S.-Soviet relations , he suggested that this would not be the best time for Mr. Gates to deliver his remarks. " // According to officials who have seen a draft of the speech by Mr. Gates , he began it by quoting passages from Mr. Baker ' s two recent addresses on East-West relations . But Mr. Baker apparently had problems with the next part , which was a detailed discussion about the economic and ethnic problems Mr. Gorbachev ' s perestroika program was unleashing and encountering . The overall assessment left the impression that Mr. Gorbachev ' s prospects for succeeding were very dim . <> <> Baker Seeks Consistent Voice // That view is widely held among top officials in the Bush Administration . Nevertheless , the position Mr. Baker has taken in his recent speeches in the name of the Administration is that whether Mr. Gorbachev is likely to succeed or not " perestroika promises Soviet actions more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do whatever it can now to " lock in " arms control and other agreements with Moscow that are mutually advantageous. // Even if perestroika does not succeed , Mr. Baker said in his speech in San Francisco on Monday , " If the Soviets have already destroyed weapons , it will be difficult , costly and time consuming for any future Kremlin leadership to reverse the process and to assert military superiority. " // Administration officials said that after all the attention given to Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger ' s recent speech about the potential for European instability that could result from Mr. Gorbachev ' s programs - an assessment that was attacked by Democrats as nostalgia for the stability of the cold war - Mr. Baker has been insistent that the Administration speak in a more consistent voice . Otherwise , he has insisted , it will be impossible to shape a domestic or Congressional consensus on East-West relations. // That was felt even more when , one day after Mr. Baker said in an address in New York on Oct. 16 that the Administration wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical advice to help change his economy , Vice President Dan Quayle gave an address in which he said , " Let them reform themselves . " <> <> Hard-Line Stance on Gorbachev // Administration officials said they were very wary of having yet another speech that might easily be interpreted as contradicting Mr. Baker in tone , if not in substance. // Mr. Gates , the former deputy director of Central Intelligence and an expert on the Soviet Union , has long been seen as the most hard-line member of the Bush policymaking team when it comes to whether Mr. Gorbachev was really intent on fundamentally reshaping the Soviet Union and whether he will succeed . This is not the first time his speeches have created some controversy. // On Oct. 14 , 1988 , while he was still Deputy Director of Central Intelligence , Mr. Gates delivered an address about perestroika to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in which he said : " While Gorbachev ' s bold political moves and radica lretotoc c ve sahek the Sovietetsys m , he has not yet really changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Russian and Soviet history cautions us to be skeptical and cautious. " // " Whether Gorbachev succeeds or fails , or just survives , a still long competition and struggle with the Soviet Union lie before us , " he said. // After the remarks were published , Secretary of State George P. Shultz " read out " Mr. Gates on the telephone , according to State Department officials , for making such a negative pronouncement without getting advance clearance . Mr. Shultz was concerned that Mr. Gates ' s speech might be interpreted as a sign that the Administration was " writing off " Mr. Gorbachev. // In May , Mr. Gates accompanied Mr. Baker to his first meeting with Mr. Gorbachev in Moscow . During that meeting , Mr. Gorbachev suddenly shifted his attention from Mr. Baker to Mr. Gates , smiled and announced that he had information that there was a cell within the security council staff that had been created for the sole purpose of discrediting perestroika and that Mr. Gates was the head of it. // Mr. Gorbachev suggested to Mr. Baker that their two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Gates out of a job . " Mr. Baker at the time defended Mr. Gates , telling the Soviet leader that everyone in the Bush Administration wanted perestroika to succeed. //
