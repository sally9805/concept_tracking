When he returned to New York City , he had no money for a place to stay and , after years of drinking binges , no friends or family who would take him in . He ended up sleeping in the parks , his only base a locker at the Port Authority Bus Terminal , where he stored his belongings for 80 cents a day. // After a week and a half , the weather grew colder and his hopes grew slimmer for escaping what he saw as a deepening rut . He decided , he said , " to regroup . " He took a bus 55 miles north to a mountainside shelter here run by the Franciscan Friars of the Atonement - a shelter John and other homeless men call " the Holy Mountain. " // " I wanted to retreat , " he said , " to regain some perspective and priorities , recapture my sense of security in a place where I wouldn ' t have to be stressed about getting a place to sleep or who ' s going to rob me. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers a stark contrast to the often squalid , chaotic scenes at many homeless shelters or Bowery flophouses . St. Christopher ' s is quiet , clean and well organized , and it is set in a breathtaking locale of forested hills that would please the most well-heeled vacationer . One man who has stayed there calls St. Christopher ' s " the Waldorf of shelters. " // St. Christopher ' s shelters as many as 200 drifters and down-and-out men at a time , and each man may stay up to 21 days a year . It is entirely financed by private contributions to the Atonement Order , and its essential requirement for admission is that a man make the journey to St. Christopher ' s Inn. // " There is something very challenging for a man to leave New York City and come up the 55 miles , " said the Rev. Blase Burniston , an irrepressibly cheerful man who is the public-relations director and who directed the inn in the late 1970 ' s. // " New York shelters are kind of a revolving door , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re out . Whereas the man coming up here is leaving all that to get a fresh start. " // St. Christopher ' s Inn was started in a converted chicken coop in 1909 by the Rev. Paul Wattson , the founder of the Atonement Order . He believed that he should share his food and lodging with wayfaring men just as the legendary St. Christopher had borne the baby Jesus. // The eight friars who operate the inn , distinctive by the cowled brown robes they wear , also take their mission from the passage in Matthew 25 : 35-40 in which Jesus describes how He will tell the righteous on Judgment Day : // " For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat , I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink , I was a stranger and you invited me in . " If the righteous wonder what it was they did , Jesus will answer : " Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine , you did for me. " // Today , St. Christopher ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes the well-known Christian Unity Center , which promotes ecumenical activities. // Three-quarters of the 4 , 000 men who pass through St. Christopher ' s in a year come from New York City . Some are referred by city agencies , but most either scrounge the $6 for a bus trip to Graymoor or venture to the Atonement residence at 138 Waverly Place in Manhattan for a free bus ticket . When the Leprechaun Line bus drops them off along Route 9 , they still have to climb the steep , winding road to St. Christopher ' s . <> <> Rules Are Announced // There , they are asked to wash and delouse themselves and allowed to choose fresh clothes from a large room that at first glance looks like a neat haberdashery , with clothes hung on racks according to size and shirts neatly stacked . On closer inspection , the clothes turn out to be worn and dated - donations from the world outside - but they are clean. // " When the men come off the road , in various stages of dishevelment , there ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of trousers to set a man on his feet again , " Father Burniston said . " They need the clothes not only for the weather , but for their dignity. " // The men also get a briefing from Frank Dickerson , a homeless man who is on a special 90-day stay . There are a few rules , he tells them. // The men must make their own beds , complete with hospital corners . They must keep their shirts tucked in . They must refrain from violence . " If you get angry , walk away , " Mr. Dickerson says. // And they must work about five hours a day helping prepare food in the kitchen or cleaning the grounds. // " The charity is there and it ' s good to have it , " said Brother Gregory Lucrezia , assistant director of the inn . " But we have to talk about these men ' s dignity . They are children of God and they have an obligation to better themselves . " <> <> The Men ' s Stories // The men sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in royal-blue blankets . They eat meals with such main courses as London broil and lamb stew . There is round-the-clock nursing care and a doctor visits daily. // When they are not working , the men can watch television on a 50-inch monitor , read books from the inn ' s library , take walks around the grounds or pray in the chapel . The atmosphere is tranquil and subdued , as if the men pick up the brothers ' contemplative habits. // Each man comes to the inn with his own story of trouble or despair . Douglas Soriano , a 41-year-old alcoholic who is enrolled in writing and psychology courses at City College , said he has been deeply frustrated by not finding a job and by living in Bowery hotels . He saw his hopes for obtaining a college degree fading. // " In college , " he said , " I ' ve been studying Maslow ' s self-actualization process , but how do you become self-actualized without a chance to do it ? " // The respite at St. Christopher ' s " gives you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maybe find some hope , " he said . But he worries that after he leaves , he will return to the same downward cycle of despair . <> <> Reclaiming Self-Esteem // Victor Malavet , 29 , of Brooklyn , was profoundly upset when his mother died ; he tried to slash his neck with a razor . He began drinking heavily . On Thanksgiving Eve , he found himself sitting in a bar near the Port Authority terminal , sobbing on an old man ' s shoulder . The old man told him about the Holy Mountain. // " I was very violent , negative , " he said . " If it wouldn ' t have been for Graymoor , I ' d be in prison , dead , or a real , real bum. " // The inn , he said , " is a good refuge for a guy that ' s got no place to turn to . I never thought a place like this existed , where you can walk in , no questions asked " // Although 90 percent of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alcoholic facility . It will send an alcoholic to a hospital for detoxification before admitting him. // Yet it does provide four Alcoholics Anonymous meetings a week and alcoholic counseling , most of which is led by Brother George Clay , himself a recovered alcoholic. // " What we can do is get the man to the point of changing direction , " Brother Clay said . " He ' s sick and tired of being sick and tired , of making resolutions in the street about tomorrow . We try to get them to look at themselves. // " They ' re not bad , not stupid . They ' re sick and we try to get them to get their self-esteem back . " <> <> Successes and Failures // When he leaves St. Christopher ' s , each man gets another suit of clothes and a topcoat to help him in finding a job . The friars have no illusions that the men will abandon lives of dissolution . Indeed , they know of men who spend their winters hopscotching around the country from one facility like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart in the fact that some men do change . Brother Clay recalls a man named Tommy who stayed at St. Christopher ' s 29 times in 30 years , but after the 29th time finally gave up drinking . " Tommy hasn ' t touched a drink now for 11 years , " he said. // And Father Burniston tells the story of a man he met while stopping at a Connecticut gas station . When the attendant there learned that Father Burniston was from Graymoor , he told him : " Look at all this ! I ' ve got a house and a gas station and a wife and children and I went through St. Christopher ' s. " // " Obviously , " Father Burniston said , " I didn ' t pay for the gas !
