 | The Big Mac . Egg McMuffin . Chicken McNugget . Ronald McDonald . The Whopper . Pizza Hut . Taco Bell . Steak ' n Shake . And Wendy 's . These stars of the fast-food circuit , propelled by television into national symbols , have fed , entertained , and perhaps changed permanently the eating habits of millions of Americans . Every day a deluge of customers ? from small children to senior citizens ? eat breakfast , lunch , or dinner at any one of the thousands of fast-food restaurants across the country . Age , sex , ethnic , and educational differences do not seem to matter . Everyone comes . A few years ago McDonald 's opened a new franchise in Chicago 's plush Water Tower Place shopping center ? amid $200,000 condominiums , the Ritz Carlton Hotel , and a Halston boutique . Any fears that the originator of the $1.78 Big Mac had overreached himself were quickly dispelled . In a matter of hours a line of fur-draped shoppers had formed , who were patiently waiting to be served . Within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the management had to expand it to double the original size . Since then McDonald 's has opened other franchises in such unlikely places as zoos , riverboats. hospitals . university campuses , airports , and office buildings . Its closest competitors ? Burger King , Wendy 's , and Pizza Hut ? have followed suit and sought even more exotic locations . And everywhere , the people come . What accounts for America 's current fast-food binge ? It 's hard to say for certain . What is certain , though , is the big jump in the numbers of working women . single adults , and senior citizens during the last decade . Changing life-styles ? and continuing inflation ? are among the factors that have helped create a demand for convenient , inexpensive restaurants . Each day approximately 40 million Americans eat in fastfood stores . The average customer eats there nine to 10 times a month . In this era of recession the fast-food industry continues to grow at the rate of 15 percent a year , earning 30 percent of the  | nation 's total restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total restaurant business , including the fastfood contingent , is the second largest industry in the country and the largest employer ( almost 4.5 million people a year ) . The chains all have certain features in common : brightly colored interiors , quick service , and cleanliness . The quality of the food , however , is strictly a matter of personal taste . The more discerning food writers have been quick to criticize the fast-food cuisine . James Beard . the eminent food critic , calls McDonald 's " . . . a great machine that belches forth hamburgers . They do n't salt things enough and the malts taste like melted ice cream . " Gael Greene of New York magazine says , " The Big Mac has all the disreputable things ? cheese made of glue and this very thin patty of something that is close enough to meat . " But Craig Claiborne , the well-known food writer and cookbook author , is kinder in his assessment : " McDonald 's hamburgers are quite swallowable . There is a highly compatible onion flavor . The French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit unfair . After all , the customers who frequent the chains do so for a variety of reasons not solely related to taste : speed , convenience . low prices , and at least one item on the menu they truly like . In the past few years the cries of " junk food " have generally receded under the weight of public popularity . There will always be die-hard critics , of course , but for a growing number of Americans , fast-foods are like rock music , wash-andwear clothes , and the gas-saving subcompact car ? live with them long enough and you find yourself not only tolerating them but unable to do without them . The current success of the fast-food chains has its roots in the past . Americans have always patronized the small corner or roadside eating place . During the 1920s , 1930s , and 1940s , the White Castle hamburger stores , Howard Johnson ice-cream parlors , and Jack-in-theBox hamburger restaurants all flourished . But the real emergence of the small , inexpensive take-out restaurant did n't take place until after World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shift radically . Suddenly young married couples flocked to the suburbs to set up households and raise families . Business followed the now of people , and networks of highways and shopping centers were built . Soon the suburbs were no longer just " bedrooms " to the cities but working communities in themselves . Now families shopped at the local mall , went to the movies ? and looked for a place to eat out . Most of the available dining places were either expensive restaurants or small mom-and-pop coffee shops . Then within one year ? 1954 ? three of today 's major fast-food chains were started or conceived . The guiding spirit behind McDonald 's was an aggressive 52-year-old milk-shake-blender salesman , Ray Kroc . He became intrigued when he received an order from a San Bernadino drive-in for eight of his multiblenders . How could a little drive-in located at the edge of the desert do so much business that it had to make 40 milk shakes at one time , he wondered ? To find out , he drove 60 miles from Los Angeles to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was little else to recommend it . Still , customers stood in a long waiting line and walked away with several bags of hamburgers at a time . Engaging in some on-the-spot research , Kroc learned that although the drive-in sold only the barest variety of food , the quality was good and the prices low . A hamburger cost 15 cents ; French fries , 10 cents ; a shake , 20 cents ; coffee , only five cents ? an entire lunch for only 50 cents . And the service was exceptionally fast . An assembly-line ordering system allowed customers to move in and out of the store briskly ? 30 seconds as compared to 15 minutes to a half hour at most other drive-ins . Kroc introduced himself to the owners , Richard and Maurice McDonald . and barraged them with questions about the operation . Although the McDonalds had streamlined their business into a highly efficient money-making machine , they seemed happy with their success as it was and told Kroc they had no plans to expand it . But Kroc had other ideas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had persuaded the McDonalds to sign a contract that set up a whole network of new McDonald 's stores and authorized Kroc to supervise it . Of course , the enterprising salesman could n't foresee the legal problems , zoning regulations , and engineering hurdles he would have to face in the coming years . But Kroc was indomitable , and a little over a quarter-century later he had built McDonald 's into an international chain of 6.700 fast-food restaurants . In doing so , he and his executives pioneered food-service technology and marketing strategies , and built a $7 billion industry employing several million people ? and made Kroc a billionaire . Other sharp-eyed businessmen also saw the potential in fast-service restaurants . That same year ( 1954 ) James McLamore and David Edgerton launched Burger King . In 1958 brothers Frank and Daniel Carney opened the first Pizza Hut , just around the corner from their family 's grocery store in Wichita , Kan . One day in the mid1960s , R. David Thomas , a vice-president of Arthur Treacher 's Fish and Chips , wandered around downtown Columbus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find one . In 1969 he opened the first of a chain of his own stores specializing in high-quality hamburgers . He named it Wendy 's , after his daughter . W bile McDonald 's may be the premier fast-food chain , there is no doubt that the most famous fast-food merchant was the late Colonel Harland D. Sanders . The " Colonel " ( the title was honorary , in the Kentucky custom ) founded the Kentucky Fried Chicken chain after an expressway diverted traffic from the roadside stand he had operated for 25 years in Corbin , Ky . In 1955 he opened the first outlet with the help of a young lawyer , John Young Brown . Jr . A charismatic entrepreneur who in 1979 would become Kentucky 's governor , Brown was immediately impressed both with the restaurant 's potential and , especially , with the Colonel as a paternal , Southern personality who might be the restaurant 's media image . Brown later recalled , " I remember I thought it would be great if Colonel Sanders could get on national television . So I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toots Shor who went ahead and got in touch with John Charles Daly . host of a popular TV program at the time , What 's My Line ? The next thing we knew , Colonel Sanders was on the program . It was " great exposure . " As the Kentucky Fried Chicken chain grew to 4,500 restaurants the Colonel became one of the country 's bestknown personalities in television and print media . With his white mane and goatee beard , black string tie and white suit , and his proud expression , " It 's finger-lickin ' good ! " Sanders emerged as the food chain 's down-home symbol . In that manner he was the role model for such later salesmen as Frank Perdue of Perdue Chickens and Tom Carvel of Carvel Ice Cream . In 1964 the Colonel sold his business for $2 billion to John Y. Brown and two  | other businessmen . Brown became president of the chain , and Sanders was retained as the company 's goodwill ambassador and media spokesman . In 1970 he resigned his directorship in the company ? only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inc. , the distiller and food-service company . After several years of ill health , the Colonel died at age 90 on December 20 , 1980 . Yet his image was so strong that many people believe he is still alive and running Kentucky Fried Chicken . D uring the 1960s the number of fastfood franchises soared . In 1962 another zealous entrepreneur , Glen W. Bell , left his position with a small Mexican chain , El Taco , to open his own Taco Bell in Downey , Calif . His specialties were two variations of the cornmeal shell ? the hard-baked taco and the soft burrito , filled with meat , cheese , lettuce , and tomato . In 1965 he licensed his first franchise , which became an immediate success and led to a flood of franchise applications . In 1978 Pepsico . Inc. , the bottler and food company , bought Taco Bell and has since expanded it to 1,400 restaurants . Arby's. a chain specializing in roast beef , was formed in the early 1960s by two brothers , Leroy and Forrest Raffel , of Boardman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hamburger restaurants , they decided to see what they could do with roast beef . They chose wisely ? Arby 's became a successful chain that inspired a number of imitators and in 1976 was sold for a healthy sum to the Royal Crown Cola Company . And then , of course . there were the fast-food chains named after celebrities , such as Roy Rogers and Arthur Treacher . In most cases the celebrities authorized the use of their names and helped to promote the business but did n't participate in the management . Although most of these companies have survived industry shakeouts to become giants in the field , the competition among the major chains today is as stiff as ever . In an effort to lure even more customers , they are spending more than ever on advertising and diversifying the menus in hopes of broadening their markets . McDonald's. oriented to youngsters , is also seeking to appeal to young and mature adults . Wendy 's , already solid with young adults , is trying to attract other age groups as well . Even Pizza Hut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is expanding its menu to include other foods . And the customers continue to come in droves . What draws them ? Perhaps  | an answer can be found in McDonald 's popular TV ad theme , " You Deserve a Break Today " ? an acknowledgement of everyone 's wish for some recognition in their lives and the need to " treat " themselves occasionally . It 's no secret that a great deal of McDonald 's success is its appeal to children . Kids obviously feel warmed and wanted in a restaurant that offers them a feast of hamburgers , milk shakes , cookies , and other desserts . They love the bright colors , the miniature outdoor playgrounds ? and most especially Ronald McDonald , the clown who appears in person at the restaurants ( as many as 35 different actors playing the role ) . Says Ray Caruso , McDonald 's vice-president of communications , " Ronald is very much loved . He shows up not just in the restaurants but at hospitals , fairs , and school safety programs . He 's real to the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Perhaps McDonald 's ? and the other chains ? have wisely seen the child in all of us . The Big Mac , the Whopper , and the Egg McMuffin have put a little fun into eating for kids of all ages . T here seems no doubt at all that the fast-food mania will continue . The three largest chains add at least one percent each year to their individual share of the market , and competitors are watching them and copying their most effective marketing techniques . Of course , there have been some costly mistakes along the path to success . Kentucky Fried Chicken tried for a year and a half to successfully sell its barbecued spareribs ? and failed . McDonald 's Ray Kroc still holds out hope for a personal favorite , the " Hulaburger , " a sandwich made of hamburger and pineapple . Gino 's faltered with its rectangular-shaped hamburger , the " Heroburger . " And whatever happened to Minnie Pearl 's Chicken Systems and Joe Namath 's Broadway Joe 's ? Something distinctive was missing , say the experts ? an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a catchy promotion . They point out that these key elements may again force changes in fastfood business . Those peering into the future insist that there will be a greater variety of types of chains and that the ethnic restaurants ? especially Mexican and Italian ? will enjoy the biggest growth . But no one predicts the demise of the well-established chains . After all , what could be more ethnic than the food the majority of customers want most to sink their teeth into ? the all-American hamburger ? And the hamburger , as everyone knows , can only have a few variations and still remain true to itself .
