As inflation zooms , the clamor for controls grows louder <P> Even on Wall Street , where bedlam often reigns and steel nerves are accustomed to roller-coaster financial markets , investors last week were reaching into their desks for bottles of Valium . As stock and bond prices plunged , limped forward and then dropped again , the nation 's moneymen cast a solid vote of no confidence in Jimmy Carter 's battle against inflation .

Applications have so fallen off that officers accustomed to having a backlog of ten to 15 loans are down to two or three .
