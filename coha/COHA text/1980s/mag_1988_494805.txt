It would be easy enough to satirize Mike Nichols 's production of Waiting For Godot . I can imagine Nichols himself doing a skit on it with Elaine May . By casting two comedy superstars as Didi and Gogo , by setting the play in what appears to be Death Valley , and by calling this Lincoln Center offering " A Mike Nichols Production , " the director invites charges that he has Hollywoodized an existential masterpiece ? carbonated the philosophical heavy water , fizzed up the tragicomic metaphysics . This celebrity gathering not only features Steve Martin and Robin Williams as the tramps , but F. Murray Abraham as Pozzo , Bill Irwin as Lucky , and Lukas Haas ( the child in Witness ) as the Boy . Since for eight weeks only they are occupying the 299-seat Mitzi Newhouse Theater ( plans for a Broadway run fell through because of the stars ' conflicting schedules ) , it ca n't even be argued that Hollywood names were needed to ensure a commercial success . Indeed , subscribers are said to be incensed over the shortage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the production expunges both the poetry and the pain of the play . Williams and Martin are very accomplished comedians . Under other circumstances , perhaps , they might have proved equal to their demanding roles ( Williams , at least , has the vocal equipment ) . But either they 've been encouraged to regard Godot as a scenario for improvisation or they 've been inspired by the standard Godot criticism that the tramps have an affinity with the great clowns of silent films and music hall : Chaplin , Keaton , Laurel and Hardy . Without understanding a word of it , Bert Lahr played Estragon brilliantly in the first New York production with the more stolid E. G. Marshall as Vladimir , and Kurt Kasznar and Alvin Epstein as Pozzo and Lucky . But while the leading parts have roots in vaudeville , this is no reason for turning the entire play into stand-up comedy . Beginning with anominous rumble and a rimshot , the evening realizes only the rimshot . Abraham and Irwin , on the other hand , are very accomplished actors , and during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Abraham 's voice was frayed the night I saw him , but he managed to turn that handicap into an asset , croaking a performance that exactly caught the alternating imperiousness and helplessness of the role . And Irwin was a consummate Lucky ? prematurely aged , unconscious of the running rope-burn sores on his neck , sand dancing on sand , creating a fanatically focused stoicism out of pain and bondage . Trained as a mime , Irwin has been growing into a fine actor , one I have previously underestimated . It 's a shame his only opportunity for speech , Lucky 's " Given the existence " monologue , was almost completely obliterated by Williams 's horseplay . Williams , looking like a Western hobo under the turned-up brim of his derby , is a performer with a special relationship to the audience . It constitutes both his strength and his weakness . A number of his lines were delivered to the house , often embroidered with quotes from popular culture : he nasalized the theme from " Twilight Zone , " twanged " Amazing Grace " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wayne impersonations , turning a rusty automobile exhaust pipe into a machine gun . He 's a very funny fellow , and one has to admire his audacity . But it 's one thing to be irrepressible , another uncontrollable : his interruptions of Lucky 's speech ( Beckett calls for a " protest " ) were downright incorrigible . He not only threw Irwin to the ground , as the text requires , but emitted bored yelps while sitting in the audience and reading a spectator 's program ( at one performance , I 'm told , he was asked to autograph it ? an entirely appropriate response under the circumstances ) . Williams never touched Gogo 's vulnerability or managed to convince us he was really unhappy . His anomie proceeded from irritability , not despair ; the lyrical exchanges with Didi came off as arguments , not invocations . Gogo is a poet , but Williams 's manic energy has its sources in prose . Martin , on the other hand , was more subdued , but not nearly as interesting . His light voice provides his acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as when ( like a Laker dunking a basket ) he attempted to place a derby on Lucky 's head without getting kicked or when he pretended to be a Big Ben chiming the hours over Gogo 's prostrate body or when he suffered a kidney attack after being libeled as a " critic . " But Martin 's inner and outer landscape , despite a growth of beard , are too cleanly contoured to accommodate the rough surfaces of this forlorn character . His persona is ultimately too California bland . So is the production . It has been carefully calibrated , meticulously orchestrated . It is filled with precision , detail , clear choices . It never releases your attention . Yet , somehow , Beckett 's European penumbra has been illuminated in all its darkest corners by a sunny American disposition . Mike Nichols is working , as usual , with very gifted collaborators ? Tony Walton on sets , Ann Roth on costumes , Jennifer Tipton on lighting ? and what they have wrought on the tiny Newhouse stage is miraculous . But I fear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for American realistic writing , distorts a work that draws its strength from abstraction . Beckett left his setting for Waiting For Godot deliberately unspecified ( " A country road . A tree " ) . This production places us , as I mentioned earlier , in a California desert . I 'm told that Beckett himself authorized the change of " Macon " ( and " Crackon " ) country to " Napa " ( and " Crapa " ) country , but it 's hard for me to believe that he would have authorized such a radical shift in geography . There may be no vineyards bordering the premises , but there 's an ocher-and-tan Western sky beaming over tons of sand , no doubt borrowed from Peter Brooks 's Carmen at the upstairs Beaumont . There is , besides , an abundance of identifiable hubcaps , automobile springs , license plates , bones , stones , and Georgia O'Keeffe cattle skulls ? so many , in fact , that the amnesia of the tramps regarding whether or not they 've visited this area before begins to verge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to criticize du viations from Beckett 's published stage directions , when a production of Endgame at my own theater , to the playwright 's everlasting chagrin , was set in an abandoned subway station , but Beckett intended God &; to be situated in a generalized purgatory . And regardless what you think of California ? even if you agree with Gertrude Stein that " there 's no there there " ? it still remains a little too site-specific to capture the abstract metaphysics of the play . Finally , Nichols 's impulse to prove the truth of Godof 's advertising claim ( in the original Broadway production ) to be " the laugh sensation of two continents " recalls his treatment of David Rabe 's Hurls Burly , a migraine play that he softened into a comic anodyne . He remains one of the cleverest American directors with no peer in casting savvy , stagecraft , or skill in handling actors . What he lacks , either through indifference , shallowness , or cynicism , is the willingness to probe beneath the outer membrane of denser material . C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant if somewhat assimilated revival of Hy Kraft 's dramatic memoir ( written in 1940 ) about the waning days of Yiddish theater . Although the play is weak , it is still a reasonably enjoyable way to spend an evening , especially for those old enough to feel nostalgic about the great actors ? Jacob Adler , Boris Thomashefsky , Maurice Schwartz , Molly Picon , Menasha Skulnick ? who consumed tea and stuffed derma between shows at a restaurant called the Cafe Royale . It is even more evocative of rude Jewish waiters , those terrorists of Second Avenue whose beady stares and acid tongues were usually a prelude to slammed plates and stained tablecloths . My father had such a waiter at a restaurant called The Grove . His name was Peretz , and one day when he was scurrying past the table scratching his behind , my father asked him : " What 's the matter , Peretz , you got hemorrhoids ? " To which the harried waiter replied : " Mr. Brustein , do n't bother me , I 'm in a big hurry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I promise not to bore you with any more anecdotes , though I 've got a few more in my repertoire ( for a short time I acted on the Yiddish stage and hung out at those caf ? s ) . But the major appeal of Cale Crown is the way it stirs up memories of a lost golden age . If you do n't have access to such nostalgia , the evening may not be your glass of tea , since it 's very weak on character and the plot turns are absurd . The story , for example , revolves around the efforts of the actor-producer David Cole ( based on Jacob Adler ) to mount a Yiddish version of King Lear set on Riverside Drive and starring an actor who is being tapped for Broadway . That 's credible enough , given the appeal of Lear to all Jewish parents who think their children are ungrateful ( which is to say , all Jewish parents ) . Where credibility falters is in the fact that the actor cast as Lear , though famous for beard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last time the Yiddish Actors Union admitted any actor into its ranks under the age of 45 ? The plot and ensuing love complications are resolved in an equally unconvincing fashion , but Cafe Crown is distinguished not so much for dramaturgy as for local color . In an affectionate reconstruction of bygone restaurant decor by Santo Loquasto , right down to pick les on the table and Yiddish newspapers on the racks ( also a copy of Time ! ) , the diners and pinochle players come and go , speaking of kreplach and onion rolls . Sam the waiter ( Fyvush Finkel ) maneuvers his way among the tables ( " Hot stuff coming up " ) while Hymie the proprietor answers the phone with cries of " Cafe Crown speaking ? Who ? " moaning about his daughter in " Bryn Mare ? Ma ? ? More ? " Eager to invest in any David Cole production so long as it is n't Shakespeare , Bob Dishy 's Hymie is a particularly accurate embodiment of the mournful sobriety of this world ? his shoulders slumped , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penguin . Eli Wallach plays the famous Yiddish actor , David Cole , plagued with financial woes , a quarrelsome wife , and an actress daughter ( Stella Adler ? ) who prefers Broadway and Hollywood to the indigent charms of family enterprises . He performs the part with energy and flair , in a black slouch hat and fur-collared coat rakishly thrown over his shoulder . But the character is just a touch too flamboyant for Wallach 's stylized realism ; what it requires is a great Jewish accents in Martin Charnin 's recreation of this Yiddish world ? Gone with the wind round the heart that followed the fried food . The play has a syrupy conclusion with all issues happily resolved , including the means to let the play proceed while allowing the young hero to go to Hollywood on opening night . But so what ? If it does n't sate your appetite for drama , it will certainly make you hunger for a good bowl of kasha and a couple of salt rolls .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
