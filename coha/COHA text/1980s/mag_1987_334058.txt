Around the world last week , the mood in international money markets could only be described as akin to panic . In Tokyo , frantic Japanese traders stayed at their desks even during a Jan. 15 national holiday to execute orders $ through branch offices and foreign subsidiaries , and through the week they dumped billions of U.S. dollars in favor of the local yen and the West German deutsche mark . In Frankfurt , harried West German moneymen followed suit despite reported efforts by the country 's central bank to stem the landslide . In Manhattan , foreign-currency trading occasionally came to a halt as money merchants momentarily failed to find any buyers at all for the U.S. greenback . Marveled Christine Patton , chief foreign-currency trader for Manufacturers Hanover Trust : " There were times when I saw the dollar plunge by a quarter of a percentage point within a few seconds . That 's very erratic , almost a free fall . " <P> Indeed it was . By week 's end much of the chaos and confusion had begun to clear up , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : after five days of often turbulent trading , the U.S. dollar had taken one of the worst pummelings in recent history against the value of the yen and the mark . The dollar lost 3.5% of its value against the mark in a single day , fluctuating around a six- year low before closing the week at 1.85 marks to the dollar , down 3.7% from the previous week . The movement against the yen was only slightly less spectacular . The greenback 's value plunged near last August 's record low of 152.55 yen to the dollar before recovering slightly to close in Tokyo at 153.1 , down 3.2% for the week . <P> The dollar 's precipitous drop was a sign of what John Lipsky , a vice president at the Salomon Brothers investment house , described as a " gigantic geopolitical game of chicken " that had broken out between the U.S. and its major trading partners . It was also a sign of a lack of confidence among money traders both in the current domestic economic policies of the Reagan Administration and in those of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something new may be required if the U.S. is to deal with its mammoth trade deficit . That deficit is expected to total more than $170 billion when the final figures are added up for 1986 . In the meantime , further disconcerting drops in the value of the dollar seemed likely . <P> Despite repeated claims that it was interested only in the orderly operation of the international financial market , the Reagan Administration had a hand in last week 's dollar upheaval . A major part of the drop came after an Administration official was anonymously cited as saying that the U.S. wanted to see a further decline in the dollar 's value . The Administration hurriedly disclaimed any such view , but in the weakest fashion , saying only that the statement was not " authorized . " At one point , White House Spokesman Larry Speakes even issued a new assertion that " the dollar is in an orderly decline against other countries , and that 's the way we want it to remain . " Then Speakes hurriedly retracted once again . <P> The fact was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world financial markets , the Reagan Administration seemed ready to watch the dollar fall even further as a way to help solve the U.S. 's trade woes . Says Rimmer De Vries , chief international economist at the Morgan Guaranty Trust : " No one in Washington is talking about stabilizing currencies anymore . "
