 | When Nancy Kelly married Ed Kleinman , they were n't sure who would show up for the wedding . Neither family was pleased : Nancy had spent three years as a novice in a Roman Catholic convent , and Ed had once dreamed of becoming a rabbi . Over the next 10 years , Nancy went to synagogue on Friday night and mass on Sunday ? alone ? but finally grew weary " of standing between two doors and wearing out the rug between them . " Although she still believes strongly that intermarriages can work , this week in Boston Nancy will immerse herself three times in a mikvah ? the bath of ritual purification ? pronounce herself " a daughter of Abraham and Sarah " and become a Jew . Nancy represents a new strand of American Judaism : " Jews-bychoice , " most of whom probably would not have converted except for interfaith marriages . Mixed marriages are on the rise ? between 30 and 40 percent of American Jews now take vows with gentiles , compared with only 7 percent in the 1950s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unions , the gentile spouse converts . But even after conversion , Jews-by-choice often experience painful problems ? strained relations with parents , lack of full acceptance by " born Jews " and rejection by strict constructionists of Jewish law , or Halakha . Only last week Orthodox legislators in the Knesset , the Israeli Parliament , tried to amend the Law of Return to exclude all Jews-by-choice except those converted by Orthodox rabbis . The motion was defeated , but not before emotional public arguments ? in the United States as well as in Israel ? over the central question : " who is a Jew ? " Halakha : The traditional answer is that a Jew is anyone born of a Jewish mother ? or who converts to Judaism . But Orthodox rabbis do not recognize converts to Conservative or Reform Judaism , on the ground that these branches of the faith do not fully observe the Halakha . On principle , the Orthodox also rebuff gentiles who seek Orthodox conversion because they are , or are about to be , married to Jews . ( Conservative and Reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it appears that personal conviction ? not just the pressures of a mixed marriage ? is the true motive . ) But the Reform rabbis broke with tradition two years ago when they enlarged the definition of Jewishness to include the children of marriages in which the father alone is Jewish , so long as they have been raised as religious Jews . They also created a national " outreach " program , employing religious instruction and counseling as means of welcoming converts and of encouraging interfaith couples to raise their children as Jews . " We want people to know , " says Lydia Kukoff , national director of the outreach program for the Union of American Hebrew Congregations , " that you do n't have to be born Jewish to be Jewish . " For many couples , the outreach program is the only forum in which they can share the tensions of intermarriage . When Carl Farless , a Los Angeles dentist raised as a Pentecostal Christian , married Laurie , a Jew , his stepmother threatened to leave his father if he attended the wedding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Farlesses have a daughter whom Carl 's father has never seen . After attending the UAHC program , Carl agreed to raise his daughter as a Jew so she can have what he calls a " flesh-and-blood " family heritage . Among gentile women in mixed marriages , children often provide the impetus for conversion . " If there had been just the two of us , I would n't have converted , " says Linda Bricker of Chicago , a onetime Sunday-school teacher in the Episcopal Church . " But we wanted to strengthen our partnership , and we knew we wanted children . " Now , she admits , she misses celebrating Christmas and , as a neophyte Jew , @# feels unprepared to tackle a full-blown kosher dinner for Jewish holidays . Linda is also awed by the idea of starting a Jewish branch on her parents ' gentile family tree . Reverse conversion is another startling notion : " What happens if my 30-year-old daughter comes to me after all this and says , I 'm going to marry an Episcopalian ' ? " Lydia Kukoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Choosing Judaism , " has faced many of these problems herself . Born into an Italian Baptist family from South Philadelphia , Lydia had long been attracted to Judaism , and when she became engaged to Bernie Kukoff , now a TV producer in Los Angeles , she decided to convert . Lydia 's decision startled her mother : " I suppose that means you wo n't be Italian anymore , either . " But her parents proved understanding , and Lydia has kept her roots alive : at her son 's bar mitzvah , there was the Italian dance music called the tarantella along with traditional Jewish songs . It has n't always been that easy , however . Like other Jews-bychoice , Lydia immediately tried to be a super-Jew , doing everything at once and doing it exactly right . " My God , I married my mother , " chided Bernie , who had been raised in an Orthodox home . Says Lydia : " I had to learn that I did n't have to be a zealot and Bernie had to learn that being Jewish is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program is essentially pastoral , its long-term impact could be revolutionary . In proposing such a program in 1978 , Rabbi Alexander Schindler , president of the UAHC , also called on Jews to propagate their faith vigorously among the religiously uncommitted . " After Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire and , later again , when Islam conquered the world , " he recalled , " Jews were forbidden to seek converts or accept them . " In America , he urged , Jews should use their religious freedom to welcome seekers after God ? and to replenish the community . In truth , the Jewish population in raisin the United States has been in a nogrowth phase for the past 10 years , partly due to losses through intermarriage . But if Jews can offset those losses through conversions , intermarriage could work in their favor . Already , says Brooklyn College sociologist Egon Mayer , the outreach effort " is making Jews think about the whole idea of Jewishnesss in very different terms ? more in faith terms than in ethnic terms . " Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special role to play among born Jews : to convert unobservant Jews-by-birth to active Judaism , and thus make every Jew a Jew-by-choice. 73
