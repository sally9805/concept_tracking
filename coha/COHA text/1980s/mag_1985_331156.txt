The London stock market is starting to look a lot like Wall Street . Suddenly large takeovers are in flower . In New York it might seem almost child 's play , but in Britain a billion-dollar merger or acquisition remains a remarkable event . Last week several behemoth-size deals were in the offing . Argyll , a supermarket chain , offered $2.8 billion to acquire Distillers , maker of Johnnie Walker Scotch and Gordon 's gin , and Britain 's General Electric bid $1.8 billion for Plessey , an electronics firm . <P> Along with the takeover tussles come some new stock offerings . The most unusual is the creation of Composer Andrew Lloyd Webber , 37 , the author of hit musicals , including Cats and Evita . Last week it was announced that early next year investment bankers at Schroder Wagg will offer to the public shares in Lloyd Webber 's company , called Really Useful . Last year the firm had pre-tax profits of $3.1 million , and it owns the rights to everything Lloyd Webber has written since 1978 . Stockholders will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muzak-treated tune from Cats . Profits from Jesus Christ Superstar , though , will not be included .
