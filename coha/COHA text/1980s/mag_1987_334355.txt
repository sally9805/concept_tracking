A visitor to Robert McFarlane 's Washington office a few months ago was surprised to see the former National Security Adviser kick the air boyishly in celebration . He had just wangled two tickets to a Naval Academy Glee Club concert in which his son was to appear . That unexpected display of emotion was memorable for its rarity , since Bud McFarlane is a man whom the word taciturn might have been invented to describe . But powerful emotions evidently boil behind McFarlane 's studiedly enigmatic face , and last week they found a sad outlet . <P> After keeping his schoolteacher wife Jonda awake through much of Sunday night by tossing and turning in bed , McFarlane failed to respond when she tried to awaken him Monday morning . He stirred only when she shook him , and then appeared to be , in her words , " semilucid . " Fearing that he had suffered a stroke , Jonda summoned a rescue squad . By the time it arrived she had discovered a note left by her husband , whose contents no one would divulge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hospital , the groggy McFarlane mumbled something to its crew about taking 25 to 30 Valium tranquilizer pills . <P> The overdose did not seriously threaten his life , and at week 's end McFarlane , still hospitalized under observation , was expected to recover completely  --  and eventually to resume testifying about his central role in the sale of arms to Iran . Police nonetheless concluded that McFarlane , 49 , had attempted suicide . <P> Why ? There appeared to be no single trigger . Though McFarlane 's hospitalization came only two hours before he was scheduled to be questioned by a presidential commission investigating Iranscam , there was no indication that he faced any damaging new disclosures . Rather , the former Marine colonel seemed to friends to be tormented by a nagging general sense of failure . As National Security Adviser , he sometimes confessed frustration at being unable to " move these elephants , " his unflattering description of the powerful foreign policy Pooh-Bahs in the Reagan Administration . <P> Still , McFarlane occasionally gave the impression that he regretted having resigned in December 1985 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief of Staff Donald Regan , to become a counselor at Georgetown University 's Center for Strategic and International Studies . He missed the excitement of Government service , for all its headaches , and Iranscam probably extinguished his prospects of becoming a policymaker again . Instead of being regarded as a wise elder statesman as he had hoped , McFarlane found himself viewed as the official who had first favorably presented a plan to sell arms to Iran , and thus led the way into a disaster that has profoundly shaken the presidency he tried to serve . <P> His part in the burgeoning Iranscam investigations deepened McFarlane 's depression . He has testified more fully than anyone else . But , says his lawyer Leonard Garment , " the more information he gave , the more he became an object of scrutiny . " Another friend adds that " he is a loyal ( ( former ) ) Marine suddenly thrust into the role of John Dean , " the Nixon White House Counsel whose Senate testimony fueled the Watergate scandal .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
