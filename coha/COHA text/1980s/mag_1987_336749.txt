As a young Army major selected for a fellowship to the Nixon White House in 1972 , Colin Powell came to the attention of two emerging bureaucratic stars : Caspar Weinberger and Frank Carlucci , director and deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget . Powell was recruited into their inner circle , and has risen with his bosses ever since . Last week Lieut . General Powell , 50 , took another large step upward , succeeding Carlucci to become Ronald Reagan 's sixth National Security Adviser. * <P> But back in March , Carlucci had to pull out all the stops just to get Powell to join the NSC as his deputy . In late 1986 Powell had taken command of the Army V Corps in Frankfurt , West Germany , after some five years in the Pentagon as an aide to Carlucci and then Weinberger . He was reluctant to quit his post after only six months . But Carlucci was determined to get his friend back to Washington . When President Reagan , at Carlucci 's urging , personally phoned Powell to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice but to obey his Commander in Chief . <P> In the sometimes Machiavellian atmosphere of official Washington , Powell is the beneficiary of a rare commodity : universal acclaim . " Loyal almost to a fault , " says former Under Secretary of Defense Richard DeLauer . " He 's just super to have around , " gushes another Defense Department aide . " Powell has become quite well known to the President and the chief of staff , " says a White House aide . " They like him . " <P> The secret of Powell 's success seems to be a combination of scrupulous efficiency and disarming charm . His tenure at the NSC is a case in point . Powell is given a good deal of the credit for restoring order and collective confidence to an organization that was fractured and demoralized during the Iran-contra scandal . As Weinberger 's de facto chief of staff from 1983 to 1986 , Powell knew early on of the Administration 's secret arms sales to Iran . Weinberger told the Washington Post last spring that Powell " was the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the arrangements for transferring the arms to the CIA . " Added Weinberger : " And it ended there . " Indeed , Powell was never deeply immersed in the controversy , and emerged with his reputation intact . <P> The son of Jamaican immigrants , Powell grew up in the South Bronx . A member of the Reserve Officers Training Corps during his years at City College of New York , he joined the Army as a second lieutenant in 1958 . Throughout his career he has shuttled easily between military outposts and Washington 's corridors of power : he won the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart for service in Viet Nam , did a stint at OMB , commanded an infantry battalion in Korea , served as a Pentagon military assistant in both the Carter and Reagan administrations .
