" This is the entryway , the highway , " David H. Dean , the 52-year-old captain of a high-powered Customs Service catamaran , said as he stared across flat glistening seas in the direction of Bimini , 45 miles away . Behind him was the Miami skyline , a finish line in pink and white. // The money and the risks have lured an increasing number of adventurers into the contest , some of them prominent figures from the worlds of professional automobile and boat racing in the state . And some of the losers now face years in prison. // Several well-known car and boat racers have been indicted in the last year , and more such indictments may be coming , law-enforcement officials say . In addition , a major maker of speedboats recently admitted concealing the source of smugglers ' cash , and this month the most prominent designer of power racing boats , Don Aronow , was shot to death in what the police described as a slaying characteristic of drug traffickers , although his death is still under investigation . <> <> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smuggling , the challenge of the chase may have drawn some of these people in , " said Leon Guinn , assistant regional commissioner of the Customs Service in Miami . " We have run into people who see it as a game out there. " // The tradition of smuggling in Florida goes back to the bootlegging days of Prohibition in the Keys and other coastal areas of the state . But it was not until the rise in the international marijuana and cocaine business in the 1970 ' s that Florida developed a demand for smugglers willing to do a risky few hours ' work for $40 , 000 to $100 , 000. // The Customs Service estimates that more than 75 percent of the nation ' s cocaine enters through Florida , Mr. Guinn said . Some of it comes in by airplane , but most arrives by small boat from the Bahamas. // The Colombia-based drug organizations that control most of the world ' s cocaine often fly their product north and transfer it to boats , either by loading it along the docks of Bimini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by dropping duffle bags from the airplanes to prearranged spots in the ocean where speedboats pick them up . In the case of marijuana , small boats often meet freighters offshore that have brought tons of the drug from South America . <> <> Steps to Counter Interceptors // While no one knows how many smugglers get through , a testament to their success is a decline in cocaine prices that is believed to reflect larger supplies , even as demand rises. // More than 100 Customs Service , Coast Guard and local police boats patrol the coast under the coordination of a radar center in Miami . Sometimes the smugglers unleash from the nearby islands half a dozen craft at 70 miles an hour or more in the hope that enough will get through to make the operation profitable . Sometimes the smugglers send decoys . When smugglers are pursued at night they sometimes try to outwit the authorities by winding through the dark , shallow shoals and sandbars of the Florida Keys at up to 60 miles an hour .

When the cocaine business burst on the scene in the late 1970 ' s , the worlds of fast boats and drug runners quickly became intertwined. // " There was an immense amount of money coming into South Florida , and people were either buying the boats for smuggling or buying boats to flash their wealth , " said John Crouse , a promoter of powerboat racing in South Florida , who is also a writer . " It was a boom to the powerboat industry , and some people were up to their eyebrows in this business.

As a penalty the company agreed to make $500 , 000 worth of fast boats for the Drug Enforcement Administration. // And last month George Morales , who holds the record for the fastest speedboat run from New York to Miami , pleaded guilty to a charge of tax evasion and to charges that he smuggled marijuana , methaqualone and 2 , 640 pounds of cocaine from Colombia through the Bahamas . <> <> Murder Casts a Shadow // Although no motive has been established , the murder of Mr. Aronow , 59 years old , who established five powerboat companies , has cast a shadow over an industry that has long produced a favored tool of drug smugglers . Mr. Aronow designed the high-speed catamaran used by the Customs Service and the Cigarette boat , which has become a synonym for smugglers ' craft . His corporate associates say he was not involved in the drug trade. // Smugglers include gas station attendants , merchants , even former police officers , and are generally as varied as the people who want to make money , officials say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have proved especially attractive to at least a few of the same people who have been drawn to automobile racing. // Last month two brothers who gained international fame on the automobile racing circuit , Bill and Don Whittington of Fort Lauderdale , were sentenced to 15 years and to 18 months in prison for their involvement in a $73 million marijuana smuggling operation. // Also indicted for drug smuggling was Randy Lenier of Davie , Fla. , a race car driver who was the 1985 Indianapolis 500 rookie of the year . And John Lee Paul , who with his son was a consistent winner on the Camel GT auto racing circuit in 1981 and 1982 , was sentenced last month to 20 years for attempted murder in a drug case and also faces drug trafficking charges . Last year , Mr. Paul ' s son , John Paul Jr. , was sentenced to five years in prison on drug charges . <> <> The Allure of Danger // Law-enforcement officials said drug investigations now under way were likely to result in further indictments of people in the racing industry. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a criminal defense lawyer specializing in drug cases , said that in the late 1970 ' s a few drivers were appearing at competitions of grand touring cars with very expensive equipment and few evident signs of how they they got the money . For years , he said , the rumor within the sport was that they had earned their money through drugs. // " Maybe they were allured by the danger , the cat-and-mouse out there in the dark , " said Mr. Rubino . " The question really is , did the smugglers become racers or the racers become smugglers ? " //
