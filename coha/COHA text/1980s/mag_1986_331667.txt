This week 's cover story , on drugs in the workplace and efforts to control their use , marks a distinct change of pace for TIME 's Economy and Business section . Says Senior Editor Charles Alexander , who supervised the project : " This story is an unusual one for us because it cuts across so many disciplines . We do n't normally focus heavily on crime , legal and civil rights issues or social problems in our columns . " <P> Alexander knows whereof he speaks . He has been a member of the Business section since 1978 , first as a reporter-researcher and , since 1981 , as a staff writer and associate editor . He is the author of cover stories on such varied topics as the budget deficit and People Express Airlines . Two months ago he became Business editor , replacing George M. Taber , who now heads the World section . " It can require a lot of effort to render the subjects of business and economics both understandable and interesting , " says Alexander . " But this cover story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> TIME correspondents across the country helped gather the disturbing statistics and personal accounts of drug use in the workplace . In Washington , Correspondents Gisela Bolte and Anne Constable interviewed officials and ex- officials of the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the Drug Enforcement Administration . Chicago Correspondent Barbara Dolan and New York Reporter Jeanne McDowell talked with employees and employers . " From $100-a-week Wall Street runner to $1 million-a-year chief executive officer , " observes McDowell , " no individual was exempt , no group of people too smart , too talented , too educated or too successful to be touched by the problem . " Los Angeles-based Correspondent Jonathan Beaty was reporting his third cover story on drug abuse since 1981 . He observes that " corporate antidrug programs and proposed mass testing of Government workers amount to a disturbing admission that all attempts to block the supply have failed . " <P> Staff Writer Janice Castro , who wrote this week 's cover story , her first for TIME , also went into the field . At a meeting of a self-help group for addicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and despair . She was especially moved by the plight of several members who were still hospitalized , undergoing detoxification . " They were very worried about returning to their jobs , " says Castro . " They knew that there would be drugs there , and they did n't want to fall back into their old habits . But the others reassured them that wherever there were drugs , there were almost certainly groups where they could find help and support . In working on this story , there were few silver linings . That was one of them . "
