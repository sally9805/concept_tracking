Slogans and placards are the standard equipment for labor protests , but last week some angry Dutch fire fighters got a little more creative . To protest a government proposal for a 3% cut in civil servants ' wages , as well as in benefits for the unemployed , aged and sick , 350 off-duty members of the Amsterdam fire brigade journeyed 40 miles to The Hague , where they filled the Binnenhof , Holland 's parliamentary complex , with synthetic fire-fighting foam . From the windows above , the ancient square looked as if a severe storm had buried it in 14 feet of snow . <P> The ersatz early-morning blizzard hid all the main entrances to the parliamentary and government buildings . When legislators showed up for work , most were not amused . Neither was The Hague 's police department , which ordered the local fire brigade to clean up the mess . Within hours , after The Hague 's firemen had attacked the foamy mountains with water hoses , the square was again clear . Other wildcat job actions and work slowdowns to protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike that has left post offices with tons of undelivered letters piled almost as high as the foam in the Binnenhof.
