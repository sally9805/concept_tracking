" It was a struggle between the fools and the impotents in this campaign . The fools have won . " <P>  --  Labor Party campaign manager Ezer Weizman <P> Foreign Minister Shimon Peres sat expressionless in his hotel suite in Tel Aviv on election night as an aide handed him the first predictions . The figures showed Peres ' left-of-center Labor Party virtually deadlocked with the right-wing Likud bloc . The small parties of right and left were racking up votes and gaining the balance of power . Peres slumped in his chair . If the trend held , his dream of an international peace conference and territorial compromise with the Palestinians in the occupied territories was doomed  --  and his own political future uncertain . <P> Less than a mile away at Likud headquarters , the party faithful watched the vote count click toward 40 and then stall . The party of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was not even close to the 61 needed to form a majority government in the 120-seat Knesset . Once again a divided electorate had voted Israel into political stalemate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Likud activist : " My God , the rabbis have won ! " <P> When the final results were in , no one was surprised that Likud had taken just 40 Knesset seats to Labor 's 39 . Broader gauged , Likud and its allies on the right had elected 47 deputies , in contrast to the 50 won by Labor and its possible partners on the left . The real surprise winners were the four religious parties . Increasing their parliamentary representation from twelve to 18 seats , they won the deciding voice in who would run Israel for the next four years . They are most likely to team up with Likud , but only after demanding an extremely high price for their cooperation . <P> The ambiguous outcome of the election dismayed those in Israel and elsewhere who had hoped for clear direction . Most bitter were those who advocate a negotiated settlement for the land and the 1.7 million Arabs of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip , occupied by Israel since 1967 . Under the probable government lineup , the prospect was for continued Arab-Israeli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a harder line by &; Jerusalem . A " fatal blow to peace , " said a P.L.O . statement . " We expect more harshness , hatred and terrorism . " <P> The Reagan Administration , which had tacitly supported Peres and his plans for Arab-Israeli negotiations , kept its dismay to itself and promised to work with whatever government emerges . Reagan 's successor will find it all the harder to nudge the region toward peace talks . American Jews were concerned that a right-wing Israel , markedly more religious and militantly nationalistic than before , would alienate or at least upset U.S. supporters already dismayed by Israel 's handling of the intifadeh . <P> Even as the votes were being counted , both Likud and Labor began a courtship of the religious parties . During the " night of the rabbis , " one religious party leader after another took center stage to air demands . " We will keep all our options open , " declared Rabbi Yitzhak Peretz , whose ultra-Orthodox SHAS Party will send six deputies to the Knesset .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
