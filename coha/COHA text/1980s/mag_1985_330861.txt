Ronald Reagan hates firing people . So instead of forthrightly dismissing his Secretary of Health and Human Services , he offered Margaret Mary O'Shaughnessy Heckler a " promotion " to Ambassador to Ireland . Her first reaction was to call the job " a nice one  --  for someone else . " Only after a 50-minute meeting with the President did she accept . Reagan then stood beside a grim Heckler at a press conference to denounce the " malicious gossip " that he had dumped her . <P> In truth , the President likes the former Massachusetts Congresswoman who has run the monstrous HHS ( current budget : $316 billion ) since 1983 . His hand was forced by Chief of Staff Donald Regan , who detested Heckler 's idiosyncratic management style . He and others complained about her lateness at Cabinet meetings , lack of preparation and indecisiveness . The Secretary 's defenders praised her successes , like reducing Medicare cost inflation , and her efforts to protect the poor and elderly against budget cutters . Heckler will take up residence in Dublin early next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lone woman Cabinet member .
