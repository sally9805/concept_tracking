Sequels , if they are to be successful , must combine elements of the original blockbuster with a new twist . The Von Bulow Affair II does just that . As before , there are the loyal maid with the German accent , the stepchildren who stand to inherit millions , the sleeping heiress who was allegedly the target of a murder attempt most foul , all set against the gilded backdrops of Newport , R.I. , and Manhattan . But this time there is the promise of new and quirky characters , while the once icy defendant , lo and behold , seems to have come to life . <P> When the retrial of Claus von Bulow on charges that he twice tried to murder his wife with insulin injections began in Providence last week , the media glare was even more relentless than last time . The Danish aristocrat 's wife Martha ( nicknamed " Sunny , " for her disposition ) von Auersperg von Bulow , heiress to a Pittsburgh fortune estimated at $35 million , went into an irreversible coma at Christmastime 1980 at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bulow was convicted in 1982 on two counts of attempted murder and sentenced to 30 years in prison . But last April , after his newly retained defense attorney , the high-powered Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz , filed a brief claiming wrongful conviction , the Rhode Island Supreme Court threw out the verdict on technical grounds . The justices ruled that the contents of Von Bulow 's " little black bag , " found by his stepson Alexander von Auersperg and containing a used syringe with traces of insulin , were illegally analyzed by state authorities . <P> The first two days of televised testimony retraced the steps of the original trial . Assistant Attorney General Marc DeSisto in his opening argument depicted Von Bulow to the jury as a freeloading layabout : " He was living off her money , and he was living well . The defendant was well aware of what he would get if his wife died . " The prosecution 's first witness was Mrs. Von Bulow 's maid of 23 years , Maria Schrallhammer , an overwrought , slightly bowed woman who could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistress had slipped into a coma while Von Bulow , sitting unperturbed on the bed reading in his bathrobe and pajamas , resisted calling a doctor for nearly five hours . " I picked her up and was holding her in my arms until the doctor came , " said Schrallhammer , tears brimming in her eyes . <P> DeSisto , the new prosecutor , is an earnest but inexperienced 29-year-old legal beagle who already seems frustrated . Von Bulow 's principal attorney for this trial is former Abscam Prosecutor Thomas Puccio , who is as brashly streetwise as Claus is polo-wise ; Dershowitz , a constitutional expert , is advising him from the wings . <P> Von Bulow , who maintained an imperious aloofness during the first trial , seems to have undergone image surgery . Though he still looks as if he would be most at home in a uniform , he has taken to draping his 6-ft. 3-in. frame with the occasional plaid sport coat instead of the somber suits of the first trial . Last week , as Corinne Grande , the presiding judge , led jurors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mansion in Newport and the alleged scene of the crime , Von Bulow strayed over to the kennel to play with the three golden retrievers he has not seen in more than three years . Suddenly he broke down . He quickly removed a paisley pocket-square , dabbed away his tears , then abruptly reset his stern jaw .
