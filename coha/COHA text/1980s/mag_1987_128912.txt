Jerry Tarkanian thought he knew how his Nevada-Las Vegas Runnin ' Rebels would cope with Iowa in the final of the West Regional in Seattle on Sunday . Oh , it was n't going to be easy : Although the Hawkeyes started a center who would do well to avoid sidewalk grates , they led the nation in rebounding margin this season , never once losing a battle of the boards . And of all the things that worry terry cloth-teething Tark the Shark  --  and there are many such things  --  his 37-1 team 's ability to rebound leads the list . " We had a hard time beating Irvine and Pacific and Long Beach on the boards , " he says . " Even San Jose beat us by 24. " // But Tark thought he had Iowa scoped out . He knew the Hawkeyes ran what he calls a " flex " offense , in which their big people came high . That meant that Armon ( the Hammer ) Gilliam , Tarkanian 's only inside force , would be obliged to follow his man-to-man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Roy Marble  --  out of rebounding position . So Tarkanian told his players to switch men with Gilliam whenever Gilliam 's charge advanced as far out as the foul line . That , Tark hoped , would leave the 6 ' 9 " , 230-pound Hammer inside to pound the glass . // The plan sounded sensible enough . And the Rebs tried it  --  really they did  --  for a half . But all that switching left UNLV discombobulated . To be sure , that 's no alibi for Vegas 's two three-point threats , Freddie Banks and Gerald Paddio , going a combined 1-for-11 from the nether reaches of the Kingdome or for the Hammer having trouble getting the ball on the offensive end . But it may explain why Lohaus scored 10 points , Marble grabbed 6 rebounds , and Hawkeye reserve forward Ed Horton went on an 8-point binge late in the half , which ended with Iowa ahead 58-42 and the Rebels nearly mutinous . // In the locker room , recalls UNLV 's Eldridge ( El Hud ) Hudson , " We were saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switchin ' . Coach , we got to just pick ' em up ! ' " // " Yeah , Coach ! " called out another one of the Rebels ' six seniors . // " Yeah , Coach ! " yelled another . // " Yeah , Coach ! " // Was this an insurrection ? The Run-in Rebels ? Hardly . Tark knew he had erred . His players had been switching all half ; now he did . " It was my fault , " he would say . " We were n't getting beat , we were getting humiliated . I had our guys so screwed up they did n't know when to switch and when not to . Consequently , we were playing soft instead of aggressive . " // Still , Vegas looked whipped . Iowa had n't lost all season when it held the lead at halftime , and here the Hawkeyes were up by 16 . And while Vegas had scrambled out of holes on several occasions  --  from 17 down to Temple , 13 down to Arizona , 21 down to Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a bench as deep as the seat of coach Tom Davis 's suit pants , appeared to be invulnerable . // But Banks and Paddio each sank three-pointers in the first five minutes of the second half , and moments later Iowa 's Kevin Gamble picked up his fourth foul on a charging call . From there UNLV went on a 19-2 tear , during which Paddio sank three straight treys . Suddenly the Rebels led 71-66 . " Even when we were still down , " Hudson would say , " Armon 's saying to me , ' It 's over . ' And when the Hammer says , ' It 's over , ' it 's over . " // Gamble did drain a three-pointer to bring Iowa to within 82-81 with 35 seconds left , and the Hawkeyes ' press induced a UNLV 10-second violation , providing Iowa with one last shot at the lead . But Gamble 's alley-oop lob for Lohaus misfired off the backboard , and Vegas co-captain Gary Graham sank both ends of a one-and-one to seal an 84-81 victory . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilliam said . " They had us down and got real soft . They were n't fighting like us . Big game like this , you got to fight like a dogfight. " // Said Davis , with rueful understatement , " With two running , pressing teams , you will see some shifts in momentum . " // Iowa had ridden just such a shift in its 93-91 semifinal defeat of Oklahoma in overtime . The Hawkeyes wiped out a 37-21 first-half deficit with a 19-0 spurt , during which Sooners coach Billy Tubbs sat back in a zone ( foul trouble , he said , left him no choice ) and let TV call the only timeout . Yet Oklahoma regained the lead after intermission , thanks to Tim McCalister . The Sooner guard tossed in five second-half three-pointers. // Oklahoma held a five-point lead with 2:05 remaining . And even after Iowa 's B.J. Armstrong sent the game into OT with a long trey , the Sooners led 91-90 in the final minute of the extra period . But Oklahoma let two defensive rebounding opportunities go by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gamble at the top of the circle for the three-pointer that put the Hawkeyes in the final . // The Rebels had an easier time with Wyoming in the other semi . Cowboy center Eric Leckner drew his third foul with 11:49 to go in the first half , and fabulous Fennis Dembo , who would score 27 points while sustaining a lively dialogue with the UNLV bench , could n't carry the Dogies and their 39-38 half-time lead the rest of the way . // After his two victories , Tarkanian would n't talk about something that 's no doubt embarrassing to him , namely a question recently posed by CBS 's Brent Musburger : " Can Jerry Tarkanian coach ? " If Musburger , like Iowa 's Davis , had written a Ph.D . dissertation on sports history , he might realize that such a question is inane . Tarkanian 's .827 winning percentage is unmatched among active coaches . Before assembling the talent with which to run at Vegas , he won at Long Beach State playing walk-it-up . Tark even has the good sense to listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone to say something like that is really out of line . " // And when the Hammer says it 's out of line , it 's out of line .
