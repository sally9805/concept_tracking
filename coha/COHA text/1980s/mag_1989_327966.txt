Many a university professor daydreams about someday casting aside his footnotes and writing a splashy novel that will sell zillions of copies and make him rich . Umberto Eco , 57 , a bearded and bespectacled professor of semiotics at the University of Bologna , fulfilled exactly that daydream eight years ago , when he concocted his **27;7688;TOOLONG hit The Name of the Rose . He wrote part of the best seller in a 50-room country retreat near Urbino that he bought and restored himself and where he spends his leisure hours expanding his 40,000-volume collection of antique books and playing the recorder in his bathroom ( because the acoustics are best there ) . <P> That bizarre scenario might seem impossible for even a semiotician to duplicate . But guess again . Eco has produced another novel , Foucault 's Pendulum , which has sold more than half a million copies in Italy since it was published last October and at one point outsold the next highest best seller by 15 to 1 . Translation rights have been assigned in 24 countries , and an English version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October . Once again the Italian press has orchestrated what it calls Ecomania with cries of delight and outrage . One newspaper praised Foucault 's Pendulum as " the novel of the ' 90s , " while the Vatican 's L'Osservatore Romano denounced it for " vulgarities . " <P> Not the least odd aspect of the affair is that Foucault 's Pendulum is not so much a thriller as a complicated parable that contains pages and pages of erudite details about such medieval phenomena as the Knights Templar , the Cathars and the Order of Assassins . And Eco steadfastly refuses to explain what his mysterious novel is all about . " This was a book conceived to irritate the reader , " he says in his drafty university office , lighting up another of the 60 cigarettes he puffs every day . " I knew it would provoke ambiguous , nonhomogeneous responses because it was a book conceived to point up some contradictions . " <P> The plot , embedded in the 500 pages of mystic history , concerns three editors in a Milan publishing house who are working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascinated by a secret plan supposedly concocted by the Knights Templar to dominate the world by harnessing its magnetic currents . The Templars , Eco explains in a 20-page aside , were one of the great military monastic orders at the time of the Crusades and were suppressed after the King of France accused them , probably falsely , of homosexuality and sorcery . <P> The editors become convinced that they can somehow unravel the Templars ' scheme if they put a secret map under Foucault 's pendulum , a device invented by the 19th century physicist Jean-Bernard-Leon Foucault to measure the earth 's rotation . The pendulum , which still stands in Paris today , will supposedly indicate a site at which the earth 's vital currents can be controlled , earthquakes can be created , and so on .
