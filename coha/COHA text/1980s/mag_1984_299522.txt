Five candidates stage a dogfight for the majority leader 's job <P> For Republicans , the presidential election was more a celebration than a genuine contest . Now , however , as the giddiness passes , G.O.P. leaders have a real election to worry about . Next Wednesday morning the 53 Republican members of the new Senate will choose a majority leader to replace Tennessee 's Howard Baker , who chose not to seek re-election to the Senate . <P> The majority leader 's job is one of the several most important in Washington , and five candidates are fighting for it . Since the majority leader can not also head a Senate committee , and since three of the five candidates are chairmen of important committees , next week 's G.O.P. caucus is almost certain to set off a new round of politicking for the various chairmanships , which are to be filled in January . <P> Baker joked that he was the Senate 's janitor , opening up the place every morning and keeping the political plumbing in good repair . But as the first Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between passive overseer and overbearing boss , nudging consensus into shape when he could , urging the White House to change legislative tacks when he could not . The institution is balky , filled with large egos and powerful fiefdoms . The majority leader has to wheedle and plead , wheel and deal , yet maintain an almost presidential gravity . <P> The declared contenders for the job , all conservatives , are Robert Dole of Kansas , Richard Lugar of Stevens : hot temper Indiana , Ted Stevens of Alaska , James McClure of Idaho and Pete Domenici of New Mexico . Dole is the front runner . Once known chiefly for his astringent wit and confident , almost arrogant intelligence , the three-term Senator in recent years has played a more statesmanlike role . " I 'm sort of a consensus builder , " he says . To the consternation of the Reagan Administration , he has pushed for tax hikes along with spending reductions as the only way to make a sizable dent in the deficit . Dole has the most serious national ambitions : he was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the G.O.P. presidential nomination in 1980 , and is thinking hard about 1988 . His colleagues may be reluctant to give him visibility and thus an early edge in the nomination race ; besides , they may not want a leader who would be otherwise engaged . <P> Lugar , buttoned-down and a bit bland , is a capable organization man who may be the second choice of Senate Republicans . If Dole might be too assertive as majority leader , the low-key Lugar could be too deferential . Elected to the Senate in 1976 , he is a relative newcomer . It seems apropos that Stevens , a 14-year veteran , is majority whip : his opinions tend to be plain and angrily expressed . " I 've got a temper , " he confesses , " and I know how to use it ! " The New Right would pick McClure , a Senator since 1973 , who shares their ultraconservatism but not their uncompromising manner . Domenici , re-elected to his third Senate term , is fair-minded and sincere in the Baker fashion . As Budget Committee chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkest horse . Says one Senator : " I do n't think Pete 's got a chance . "
