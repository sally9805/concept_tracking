What is one of the ten most beautiful women in America doing in the middle of a Louisiana cornfield ? Patience , all will be explained . Actress Lisa Bonet is best known as the spunky , spaniel-eyed daughter Denise on The Cosby Show . But this summer Bonet , 18 , wanted a change of image . So she made Angel Heart , with Mickey Rourke and Robert De Niro . In the movie , due for release next March , she plays a bayou-country fieldworker who has an infant son  --  and incidentally is a voodoo priestess . " Not a conventional teenager , " allows Bonet , who drew on her Creole roots . " I had to do a lot of self- exploration . " Bonet was not moved to any self-exploration by the news that the latest Harper 's Bazaar had included her on its most beautiful list . ( Among the others : Nancy Reagan , Cybill Shepherd , Priscilla Presley and Maria Shriver . ) " It 's definitely a nice honor , " sighs Bonet , " but there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth . " Heathcliff Huxtable would be proud of such a level-headed reaction .
