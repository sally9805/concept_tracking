A trouper in ' 84 , Bush sets his sights on ' 88 <P> If the fateful moment should arrive , would George Herbert Walker Bush be ready ? The question is not an idle one as American voters grant the oldest President in U.S. history his desire to spend another four years in one of the world 's most demanding jobs . As a former Congressman , Ambassador to the U.N. , head of the Republican National Committee , special envoy to China and director of the CIA , Bush had far more national and world affairs experience than Reagan when both entered the White House nearly four years ago . Since then Bush has been treading the thin line between obsequiousness and his own itch to take charge one day . Critics dismiss him as Reagan 's lap dog ; the boss calls him " the best Vice President ever . " <P> Bush , 60 , has been a loyal supporter of Reagan and his discreet adviser . The two men normally have lunch together every Thursday . To Bush 's credit , the substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in charge of a task force to reduce governmental red tape , sent him off to calm NATO countries about the deployment of Pershing II and cruise missiles in Europe , and made him head of an interagency special-situation group . Bush has visited 59 countries and logged almost 550,000 miles on presidential assignments . He is the only member of the Administration , except for the U.S. Ambassador to Moscow , to have met with Soviet Leaders Yuri Andropov ( at Leonid Brezhnev 's funeral ) and Konstantin Chernenko ( at Andropov 's ) . The best preparation for the vice presidency , he jokingly advised Geraldine Ferraro , was buying " a black hat with a veil . " <P> Bush 's finest moments may have come in the period after Reagan was shot . Taking charge of high-level meetings , he acted calmly and with sensitivity . He stayed away from the vacant Oval Office , and presided over the Cabinet from his own chair rather than that of the President . Said Chief of Staff James Baker at the time : " He is performing extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or overly assertive . " <P> Nonetheless , Bush 's leadership abilities are still open to question . He has never won an election on his own outside Harris County , his congressional district in Texas . Twice he ran for the U.S. Senate and lost . Along the way , he got a reputation as a political chameleon . Running against Senator Ralph Yarborough in 1964 , Bush described himself as a Goldwater Republican who opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the nuclear test-ban treaty . Two years later , he ran as a moderate to win a House seat from a conservative Democrat . With his Yankee background ( Andover , Yale ) and Establishment connections ( son of a Connecticut Senator and former member of the Trilateral Commission ) , Bush was often seen as a Rockefeller Republican .
