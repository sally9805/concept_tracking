I remember the time I decided to make a sign to take to a sporting event . I was 12 , and my dad had gotten tickets to a Chicago Bears game , and I intended to celebrate this special event by printing a message on a bed sheet that I would then hold up sometime during the game . I did n't have anything profound or witty to say ; the sign would be less a message to my fellow football fans than a sort of preadolescent yip. // The making of the sign was no fun . The sheet moved too much , the felt-tipped pen stuck , the letters drooped . I think the sign was to say GO BEARS , but I 'm not sure , because I never finished it . I got bored and read the Sunday comics instead . The weather turned bad , and my dad and I decided not to go to the game . // I never displayed my banner , and come to think of it , I never made another one . But I 've always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could make another banner saying almost anything I pleased and take it to a pro game anywhere in the U.S. and exercise my historic right as a fan to show it to anyone who cared to look . // Now I find out that maybe I ca n't . There has been a series of crackdowns on banner rights in recent months . First , on June 11 a New York Yankee fan named Andy Padian was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct for marching through the stands at Yankee Stadium with an anti- George Steinbrenner sign . Later in the season plainclothes security personnel at the Stadium removed from the upper deck signs displayed by spectators that were critical of Yankee management , while other guards prevented fans from unfurling a banner that also attacked management . // Not long after that , fans ' banners were confiscated at Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati during a Bengal game and at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego during a Charger game . The reasons given by management for each act of literary repression : The banners were inappropriate , i.e. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proprietors of the games . For the record , the San Diego banner read WELCOME TO ORTMAYER 'S HOUSE OF SHAME . // Let 's look at the latter inflammatory message , displayed at the Chargers ' final preseason game , against the Phoenix Cardinals . Steve Ortmayer is the Chargers ' director of football operations , a man who some people feel has not done a great job of building up one of the NFL 's doormats . Berating Ortmayer is not a nice thing to do , but it falls well within the tradition that says a fan may boo a lousy quarterback , make noise while the opponent has the ball and wear a sack on his head when the home team stinks . // But the Chargers , like the Yankees and Bengals , do n't buy that reasoning . Instead , they take the " It 's our game and you 'd better act the way we want or else " approach . They 'll toss out any sign they do n't like . " And why ? " says Jack Teele , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we pay the rent . " // Aha ! But is that enough to give one license to act as the Banner Gestapo ? Allisyn Thomas , a deputy city attorney for San Diego , is n't so sure . " Obviously , Jack Murphy Stadium is a public property , " she says . " And certain constitutional requirements concerning free speech and freedom of expression have to be adhered to by tenants . " Riverfront Stadium and Yankee Stadium are also publicly owned structures . // The Chargers counter by pointing out that all banners at the stadium must meet four decency criteria : They must 1 ) be germane to the game , 2 ) contain no profanity , 3 ) not block anyone 's view and 4 ) not be " disparaging . " Ignore the " germane " part for the moment ; what does disparaging mean ? " Oh , you know , " says Teele . " If it said ' Screw the L.A. Times ' or ' Fire Ortmayer. ' " // Fancy that . The Chargers now defend out-of-town newspapers ! // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defenders of causes large , small and sometimes bizarre . " By allowing banners , they 've created a public forum which requires that views be aired , " says Linda Hills , executive director of the San Diego ACLU . " They ca n't just ban the views they do n't agree with . " // And what about those " germane " banners that trash opposing teams ? Nobody ever takes down San Diego banners that rip into the L.A. Raiders , for instance . Is that fair ? // It looks like war . Once you get the civil liberties folks cranked up , you know you 're talking serious issues and Bill of Rights analysis . To avoid all that , I have a solution for disgruntled fans . Here 's a form letter for your signs that can get your message across without being profane , disparaging or ungermane : // Dear ( choose one ) Owner , President , Coach , Emperor : // I sing the song of you . I am blessed to enter your abode . I kiss your feet . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tool , Pet Dog , // ( Signed ) Your Name
