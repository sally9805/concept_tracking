' I am Just a Symbol " <P> Since his installation nearly three months ago , Archbishop Joseph Bernardin has barnstormed his new archdiocese , the largest in the nation . He has called on Polish parishioners in the blue-collar suburb of Cicero , conducted a prayer service in honor of the city 's Hispanics , mingled with crowds at an ethnic-heritage Mass and family picnic in Grant Park and appeared in full ecclesiastical garb to bless Catholic charismatics . He has alternately pressed the flesh of the faithful and turned a sympathetic ear to complaints about parochial-school funds and church closings . However distressing the nuclear dilemma may be to him , Bernardin feels called , first and foremost , to make peace in his own parishes . <P> Although Bernardin has conscientiously tried to avoid the inevitable comparisons with his unpopular predecessor , the late John Cardinal Cody , Chicago 's Catholics seem to delight in the obvious differences . A balding man with blue eyes that beam benevolently through thick glasses , the new archbishop may seem to be an unlikely object for a personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cody . As one woman who pushed forward to shake his hand during a recent visit to a parish on the predominantly black West Side explained , " That man can feel . There is a lot of healing that has been done since he has been here . " <P> Bernardin has certainly moved with dispatch to ease the problems and stresses left by Cody , who was not only autocratic and aloof but was plagued by personal and financial scandal during the last year of his life . Barely an hour on the job , Bernardin made a luncheon date with a pastor from a struggling black church who had been trying for two years to get permission parishioners Chicago nuns from Mother Teresa 's order , the Missionaries of Charity , to work among his parish poor . Bernardin not only gave the venture his enthusiastic endorsement but volunteered to write Mother Teresa himself . <P> Long demoralized by Cody 's indifference , Chicago 's 2,468 priests have suddenly found that their opinions matter on such issues as financial accountability and the church 's social mission . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Bernardin plans to convene an archdiocesan synod ( the last one took place in 1905 ) . <P> The son of a stonecutter immigrant from northern Italy , Bernardin was the only Catholic boy on the block in his home town of Columbia , S.C . Of necessity , childhood became a venture in grass-roots ecumenism . He recalls , " I used to go to the Bible school that the Baptist church sponsored , especially on the days when they gave out ice cream . " <P> His father died when Bernardin was six , and the boy , his younger sister and their mother moved in with a series of aunts and uncles . Intent on becoming a doctor , he finished one year as a pre-med student at the University of South Carolina . Then Bernardin surprised his family by deciding to enter the priesthood . Says he : " I do n't want to sound dramatic , but it must have been the Lord . I had a very definite feeling that I was being called to the priesthood. "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
