Israel 's national unity government is an apt reflection of the population it serves : argumentative , divisive and incapable of achieving consensus on how to deal with the Palestinian question . Now the latest attempt at unity is faltering after seven months , as the country 's two major parties bump heads over the future course of a peace plan that calls for elections in the occupied territories . Bowing to pressures from hard-liners within his Likud bloc , Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir two weeks ago saddled the proposal with conditions that are anathema to the Palestinians . Labor Party leaders responded last week by voting to quit the government . The move , yet to be ratified by the party 's 1,300-member Central Committee , threatens not only to wreck the coalition but also to kill the peace plan . <P> Arguing that the basic proposal was still intact , Shamir called Labor 's impending withdrawal " misguided . " Labor leader Shimon Peres countered that " there is no reason to remain in the government , " but invited Shamir to " retract " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palestinian residents from participating in the elections . The Bush Administration signaled its irritation by reviving talk of an international peace conference , an option repellent to Shamir . In a New York Times interview , Yasser Arafat , chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization , called the Likud stipulations a " deadly blow , " but he did not torpedo the plan . <P> Labor 's decision to delay the Central Committee vote until perhaps early August was viewed as an attempt to seek reconciliation . Labor 's reluctance to leave the government is not surprising ; a recent opinion poll indicates that a new election would result in victory for Likud . <P> The U.S. struggled to keep the plan afloat , but each move served only to further sour relations with Israel . When Washington passed word that it hoped the Israeli government would remain intact , Labor leaders denounced the bid as a " gross interference in Israel 's internal affairs . " When the Bush Administration described as " senseless and tragic " a Palestinian attack on % an Israeli bus two weeks ago that resulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. had not denounced the act as terrorism . And when a U.S. official implied that Israel and the P.L.O. , using American intermediaries , had engaged in secret contacts , Labor and Likud responded with a unified denial . This week a State Department delegation had been scheduled to travel to Israel in hopes of preserving the government and the peace plan , but the trip was scrubbed after U.S. officials received assurances that the Israelis would resolve the two difficult issues among themselves .
