p 10 sonic rifle across my chest , and went off with them . The last thing I remember about the spaceport was a missionary who had flown out with me from Barringer IV , staring at me with a worried expression and crossing himself as I followed the two barbaric-looking Bluegills out into the hot , humid air of Peponi . We passed through some sun-bleached countryside that was teeming with exotic-looking animals . There were huge herds of shimmering silver herbivores , and smaller groups of longnecked creatures that watched us curiously as we passed by . Off in the distance I could see some enormous brown shapes , but they were too far away for me to make out any details . Now and then we 'd pass a catlike carnivore lying in the shade , but although I kept my sonic rifle at the ready , none of them paid the slightest attention to us . I found it extremely frustrating not to be able to speak with my guides . I was hot and tired and thirsty , and I wanted to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at least sent a landcar for me . In fact , I was on the verge of turning around and marching back to the spaceport when we came to a large camp set in a wooded glade . There were a number of grass huts that had been constructed in a large semicircle , plus two geodesic bubbles carefully located under the shade of some overhanging trees . A few primatelike animals sat on one of the branches , listening to the noises that were emanating from a landcar that was parked about thirty feet away from them . I could hear the sounds of metal hitting against metal , and I saw two legs sticking out from beneath the vehicle . " Hello ? " I said , and a moment later a large , weathered , gray-haired man pulled himself out from under the landcar . " You Hardwycke ? " he asked , wiping some grease off his face . I nodded . " Well , you seem to have got here without any trouble . " pI 11 He extended his hand . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the landcar , but we broke an axle . " He spat on the ground . " I tell them and I tell them and I tell them , and they still think that the faster you go over the potholes , the less damage it 'll do to the damned car . " He spat again , and I saw that he was chewing a reddish tobacco . " Well , can I offer you something to drink ? " " Anything cold will do , " I said , dropping my backpack on the ground and balancing the two rifles atop it . " You look tired , " he said after barking an order to one of his Siboni , who brought me a container of lukewarm beer . " I am , " I said . " That was a long , hot walk . " I took a sip of the beer , decided that I liked the distinctive taste , and then took a long swallow . " You 'll walk a lot longer than that before you 're through with this job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " you should have had the Bluegills carry your gear . That 's why I sent two of ' em . " " I did n't know how to ask them , " I replied . " You do n't ask ' em , son , " he said . " You tell ' em . " He barked out a few more commands in Siboni , and immediately the camp came to life , with Bluegills scurrying about , lighting a campfire , taking my gear to the bubble that Oxblood had designated as mine , cleaning off the tool kit . The activity caused the primatelike animals to retreat , chattering noisily , to the higher branches , and a number of small , colorful avians fluttered away . Oxblood turned back to me . " I 'll translate for you for two weeks , " he said . " And then ? " I asked , lighting up a small cigar and offering one to him , which he refused . " Then you 'd better learn Siboni , or teach ' em Terran . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the side of his neck . " It 'll be easier for you to learn Siboni. " p 12 " How long did it take you to learn Siboni ? " I asked . " Oh , four or five months . Not much to it . Simple language , really . " " But you 're only giving me two weeks , " I pointed out . " You do n't have to learn the whole damned language , " he replied , and I could n't tell if he was irritated or amused . " The only thing you have to learn is what to tell ' em when you 're out hunting , or you want something done in camp . " He got to his feet . " Ready for dinner ? " " I thought I 'd bathe first , " I replied . " I 'm pretty grubby . " " Take a I ) ryshower , " he said . I must have looked my disappointment , because he stared at me and added : " Water 's in short supply around here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mile in that direction , " I said , pointing back toward where I had come from . " It 's loaded with killer snakes , " replied Oxblood . " Besides , that stuff takes three days to purify  --  and we 're not going to be here that long . " He paused . " Son , I imagine you 're used to soaking in a tub , but you 're on Peponi now . We 'll be going places where you 'll be grateful for three swallows of water a day , and we wo n't have any to waste on anything frivolous like bathing . " " I understand , Mr. Oxblood , " I said . " I 'm not sure you do , " he replied seriously . " But you will . And call me Ephraim . " " All right , Ephraim , " I said . " One more thing , " he said , looking up at me . " What do you want to be called  --  August or Hardwycke ? " I shrugged . " It makes no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it makes a difference to the Bluegills . " " I do n't understand . " " You 're their boss , " he said . " They 're expected to call you Boss something . It do n't matter which name you choose , but take one or the other , so they 'll know . "  | " Hardwycke , I suppose . " " Good enough , " he said . He clapped his hands together , and suddenly all of the Bluegills came to attention and turned to him . He then said something in Siboni , the only two words of which I understood were " Boss Hardwycke , " and the Bluegills all nodded . Then he went back to work on the landcar , they returned to their duties , and I wandered over to my bubble to take my Dryshower . When I emerged , dressed in a fresh outfit , Oxblood uttered another command and one of the Siboni walked over to my bubble and took my dirty clothes away . " He 'll have them washed by tomorrow morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he continued , gesturing to the Siboni . " He 's yours for as long as you work for me . " " Mine ? " I repeated . Oxblood nodded . " Do n't ever tip him , because he does n't know what money is . Whack the hell out of him when he fucks up , and give him some extra meat when he does good . " I nodded . Then the odor of the sizzling meat reached my nostrils and I walked over to the campfire . " I 've never eaten food that was cooked over a fire before , " I remarked . " If these idiots would learn how to pack the camp stove properly and stop hitting every bump on the trail , you could remain in blissful ignorance , " he said . " They 've broken three stoves , and I finally just gave up on it . " There were a number of thick pieces of meat cooking on a metal grill , and the sight and smell of it reminded me that I had n't eaten all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " Dust Pig , " he answered . " What 's that ? " " Closest thing Peponi 's got to a wild boar , " replied Oxblood . " Ugly as sin . Weighs about six hundred pounds , and spends most of its time rooting around in the dirt . " p 14 " It smells good , " I said , buttoning my tunic as the air started turning cooler . " Tastes awful , " said Oxblood . " You ever bring one of these back for dinner , you 're gone the next day . " " Then why ? ? " " The Siboni are mighty warriors , " he said sardonically . " They wo n't hunt anything that does n't have an equal chance to kill them  --  and a Dust Pig against a spear is a pretty fair contest . " " What kind of animals will I be hunting for you ? " I asked . " Mostly Silvercoats , " he said . " What are they ? " " I 'll take you out tomorrow morning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me . " You brought what I told you to ? " " A sonic rifle and a projectile rifle , " I said . " Good , " he said , nodding . " I 'm going to miss my laser weapon , though . " " Too dry around here , " he said . " Miss a shot and you might set the whole damned countryside on fire . " He paused . " Before we go out , we 'll set up a target and zero in your weapons for two hundred yards ; you 're not likely to get much closer than that to a Silvercoat  --  they 're awfully skittish . " He looked at me again . " What kind of stuff did you hunt on your home world ? " " Small game , mostly  --  and a few antelope that were imported from Earth . " " Well , you 'll learn . " " I hope so , " I said . " I hope so , too . I hate funerals . " " I thought I was your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " My fifth . " " You buried all the others ? " " Two of ' em . One quit . " " What about the fourth ? " I asked .  | " That 's the one you 're replacing , " said Oxblood . " He 's off hunting Landships . " " I 've heard of them , " I said . " Are they as big as people say ? " " Depends on which people you 've been talking to , " he answered . " They go about ten tons , give or take . " " I 'd like to see one . " " You will . Half the Men on Peponi are here to hunt them . " He turned and barked a command into the gathering darkness , and a moment later a Siboni walked up with a small felt bag in his hand . Oxblood took the bag , inserted his hand , and pulled out a beautiful , red-tinted , multifaceted crystal about the size of my fist . " Here , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Just in holographs , " I said , handling it reverently . " But I 've read about them . This thing is really a Landship 's eye-ball ? " Oxblood nodded . " That 's right . We call it an eyestone out here . " " It 's beautiful ! " " The jewelers back on Earth and Deluros VIII ca n't get enough of them . One with the proper shade of red goes almost five thousand credits ; even the yellow ones bring a thousand or so . " He paused . " I ca n't figure out why the blue ones are worthless , but I suppose they have their reasons . " " How do you get close enough to tell what color they are ? " I asked , handing the eyestone back to him . " Carefully , " he said with an amused chuckle . " It seems to me that you 'd kill them first and worry about the color second . " " That 's the way they used to do it , " he agreed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve hundred credits for a Landship license , so you can take a real beating if you come up with all blue eyes , and you barely break even with yellow ones . Hunting Landships has changed from a mass p 16 slaughter to an exact science  --  which is n't to say that they do n't get poached like there 's no tomorrow . " He paused . " Still , a good hunter can obey the law and get rich from it . Fuentes brought down more than two hundred of them last year  --  one hundred and ninety-seven reds , five yellows . " " I 've read his book , " I said , peering off through the failing light at the horizon , just in case a Landship happened to be passing by . It was n't , though a huge herd of large brown herbivores had moved into view , followed at a respectful distance by a smaller group of spotted animals that seemed to be digging for roots . " That was one of the things that convinced me to come to Peponi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snort . " Really ? " " Fuentes maybe a hell of a hunter , but he 'd have trouble just writing his name in the dirt with a stick . Divide everything he says by three and you 'll be a lot closer to the truth . " " Do you ever hunt Landships for their eyeballs ? " I asked . " Eyestones , " he corrected me . " Not if I can help it . It 's easier trading for ' em . " " You mean with the Bluegills ? " He nodded . " A lot of them wear eyestones as ornaments . " " You 're kidding , " I said uncertainly . " No one could bring a Landship down with just a spear . " " They do n't , " he said . " But whenever they find a dead one , they cut out its eyestones . Usually they 'll trade a pair for a side of meat , though some of them prefer salt or copper , and a few want something even more exotic . " Suddenly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell was that ? " I asked . " A Bush Devil , probably , or maybe a Demoncat , " he said with no show of concern . " They start hunting at dusk . " " Do they ever hunt Men ? " " No , they mostly hang around the outskirts of the big herds p 17 and pick off the young and the sick  --  though , " he added thoughtfully , " I do n't suppose they 'd pass up a lone , unarmed Man if he blundered into them . " Two Siboni approached and set up a small table and chairs , complete with a tablecloth and an artificial light that seemed invisible to the insects . " Dinner time , " announced Oxblood , walking over to a chair . " Where do the Siboni eat ? " I asked , sitting down opposite him . " They 'll gather around the fire to sing and dance and eat after we 're done , " said Oxblood . " There wo n't be a shred of meat left on that Dust Pig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " I read in Fuentes ' book that they only eat the hearts of animals they 've killed , and that they leave the rest for scavengers . " Oxblood chuckled . " There 's a difference between preferring the heart and refusing to eat any of the rest . Still , " he added , " if one of ' em ever does anything exceptional , something you 'd really like to reward him for , toss him the heart of whatever you 've shot for dinner that night . " He paused . " They think it makes ' em brave . Me , I 'd rather have the heart of whoever killed it , if it was bravery I was looking for . " " I noticed their huts , " I said , gesturing toward the semicircle of grass dwellings just beyond the glade . " Do they live here permanently ? " " No . They can build one of those things in maybe twenty minutes . They just abandon ' em when we leave . " He issued another command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment later I had my first taste of Dust Pig . It was every bit as bad as Oxblood had said it was : tough , chewy , with a strong gamey taste . I ate about half my portion , and then shoved my plate away . He said something else in Siboni , and one of the Bluegills brought a dish filled with exotic fruits to the table . p 18 " Dessert , " announced the Siboni . " I thought they could n't speak Terran , " I said , surprised . " Oh , now and then one of them picks up a couple of words , just to show off , " replied Oxblood with an unimpressed shrug . " Hell , give ' em half a chance and they 'd be wearing our clothes and drinking our booze . And there ai n't a one of them who would n't swap his wife and kids for a chance to drive the landcar . Do n't know why they 're so hot to pretend they 're Men ; you do n't see any of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meal with some warm beer  --  Oxblood explained that one of the Siboni had broken his portable refrigerator  --  and then headed off toward our bubbles . I was sweating so profusely that I took another Dryshower , then climbed gratefully into my bed . The chirping and hooting and screeching of the nearby fauna was broken by an occasional roar from a distant carnivore . I listened , fascinated , for a few moments , but before long I fell into a deep , exhausted sleep . It seemed that my head had barely hit the pillow when I heard Oxblood barking orders to the Siboni . I got to my feet , slipped on my clothes , and opened the door of my bubble . " What 's the matter ? " I asked blearily . " We 're breaking camp , " answered Oxblood . " Grab yourself some coffee and then get ready to move out . " " It 's still night out , " I said . " Sun 'll be up in another twenty minutes . We 've got a lot of ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I walked over to the table that Prumbra had set up , had two quick cups of coffee , and then loaded my gear into the back of the landcar . Prumbra carefully added my freshly-done laundry to my pack . " Okay , " said Oxblood , approaching me . " The Siboni will head north and make camp where the river forks off , about fifteen miles ahead . We 'll meet ' em there for lunch . " " Where are we going ? " I asked . p 19 " Across the savannah , " he said , climbing into the driver 's seat and activating the landcar . " It 's time to find out what you can do with those guns of yours . " I pulled myself up to the passenger 's seat , and a moment later we were headed out toward the seemingly endless grasslands beyond the glade . " Now ordinarily we 'd just pull up to the first herd of game we saw and blow one of ' em away , " explained Oxblood . " No sense giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sport . But since you 're going to be on foot a lot more than you 're going to be in the landcar , I think we 'll stop about half a mile away from whatever it is that we fancy for the dinner table and let you stalk it . " We were no more than half a mile into the grasslands when we saw a huge herd of enormous , horned herbivores . " Thunderheads , " he said . " They go close to a ton apiece . Nasty sons of bitches ; hard as hell to kill . " " Do you want me to take one ? " I asked , reaching into the back for my sonic rifle . He shook his head . " Too tough . They make lousy eating . " We drove a bit farther , and then he began making a large semicircle around something that was lying in the grass . " What 's that ? " I said , holding a hand up to shield my eyes from the glare of the sun . " Bush Devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little closer so you can get a good look at it . " He continued driving in a semicircle , but made it a little tighter , and suddenly I could see a russet and gold catlike creature laying down in the tall grass . " One of our carnivores , " said Oxblood . " Not as big as a Demoncat , but pound for pound he 's a meaner customer . Beautiful protective coloration , too ; very difficult to spot . " " But you spotted him , " I noted . " How ? " He smiled and pointed to the sky , where a dozen large avians were circling overhead . p 20 " He 's on a kill , " explained Oxblood . " As soon as he leaves , they 'll come down for the leftovers . " He turned away at a right angle to the Bush Devil and headed off across the plain again . Within a few minutes we came to a large mixed herd of grasseaters , containing four or five different species , and the landcar came to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing the wind with the smoke from his pipe . " See those silver fellows out there ? " I looked , and was able to make out about three dozen delicate silver-coated animals in among the predominately brown herbivores . " Yes , " I said . ' Fhey 're Silvercoats , " he said . " They make the best eating . " He paused . " The males have the big spiral horns ; the small straight horns belong to the females . Try to bring down a yearling who 's just starting to sprout its horns ; they 're the tenderest . " He paused . " The heart 's just behind the left elbow , in the bottom third of the chest . " " How close am I likely to get before they break ? " I asked . " A couple of hundred yards if you 're lucky . " I put back the sonic rifle and pulled out the projectile weapon . " They 're too closely bunched , " I said . " I 'd probably cripple a couple of them if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement , then leaned back on the seat while I slipped out of the car and began approaching the Silvercoats . When I got to within 300 yards they started getting nervous , and a moment later two brown herbivores broke and started racing away . The Silvercoats soon followed suit , and I quickly raised my rifle , got a young Silvercoat buck in my sights , and fired . For a moment I thought I had missed , because absolutely nothing happened , but after he had run for perhaps half a mile he suddenly staggered and collapsed to the ground . Oxblood picked me up in the landcar , and we drove over  | to the dead Silverbuck . The old man got out of the car , walked over to the animal , looked at the bullet hole , and nodded . " You 'll do , " he said . " Let 's get this thing loaded . " " Do you want to skin it first ? " I asked . He shook his head . " That 's Bluegills ' work , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waited for me to grab the head , and we heaved it onto the back of the landcar . " Prumbra 's feeling bad because he 's working for you now instead of me , " said Oxblood as we began driving off . " Give him this fellow 's heart tonight , and it 'll set things straight with him . " " All right , " I agreed . We spent the next three hours driving across the plains , Oxblood spotting various animals and pointing them out to me , and then , as the sun climbed higher in the sky , he decided that it was time to turn north and rejoin the Siboni . We had been going in a straight line for almost four miles when he suddenly came to a halt and raised his binoculars to his eyes . " Interested in seeing a Landship ? " he asked . " Hell , yes ! " I said excitedly . " Keep your gun handy , " he said , turning sharply to his right . " They 've been hunted pretty heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to charge as to look at you . " He turned to the northeast , and after a moment I could see three huge figures standing out against the stark landscape , right beside a small grove of tall green trees . As we approached to within a quarter mile of them , I was able to distinguish their features . They were burly animals , standing perhaps sixteen feet at the shoulder , and covered top to bottom with shaggy brown fur . Their heads were enormous , and each had a long prehensile lower lip that seemed almost as adaptable as a human hand . Their ears were small and rounded . Their noses were quite broad ( and appeared even broader as they turned to us p 22 with flared nostrils testing the wind ) . They gave an impression of tremendous strength , but I had read in Fuentes ' book that they were also capable of speeds of up to twenty-five miles per hour over short distances . " Well ? " whispered Oxblood . " I never saw anything that big before , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " There 's a big concentration of blood vessels in the shoulder , " he explained . " A well-placed soft-nosed bullet will usually kill them from shock . " " What about a brain shot ? " He chuckled . " No bullet ever made could get through all that bone . " Ile paused . " See that little indentation in the skull , just in front of the ear ? " " Yes . " " A blast from a sonic rifle right there will do it . Two inches too high or too wide and all you 've got is one mighty annoyed Landship . " " I ca n't see the color of their eyes , " I said , borrowing the binoculars from him . " Well now , that 's the problem , is n't it ? " he replied with an amused grin . " How close do you have to get ? " " Thirty yards should do it  --  if he 's looking right at you , " said Oxblood . " Otherwise , fifteen or twenty . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and find out that the eyes are blue ? " I asked . He chuckled again . " Then you run like hell and hope he 's too busy feeding his face to bother with you . " One of the Landships took a few tentative steps toward us and let out a loud bellow . " Is he going to charge ? " I asked . " I doubt it . He 's probably just trying to scare us away so the wife and kiddies can come out from that patch of trees over there . " p 23 The animal bellowed once more , and Oxblood began backing up the vehicle very slowly . " Sudden movements bother ' em , " he said . " They 're less likely to charge if you back off slowly than if you race off in a cloud of dust . " The Landship kept walking after us . " Well , if he 's dumb enough to leave his friends and come out in the short grass , he probably should n't be passing on those genes anyhow , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landships on my current license . Why do n't you pretend you 're me , take your rifle , and wait here for him ? " " Where will you be ? " " I 'll keep backing straight up , so that he comes right up to you , " said Oxblood . " Wait until he 's about twenty-five yards away , and then , if his eyestones are the right color , pop him . " " And if they 're not ? " " Touch your hat with your left hand , and I 'll speed up and start leading him away from you . " " What if he 's more interested in me than in you ? " I asked nervously . " Landships have terrible eyesight , and the wind 's blowing away from him , " said Oxblood calmly . " At twenty-five yards he wo n't be able to tell you from a tree stump , and mighty few Landships charge tree stumps . " I pulled out my projectile rifle and cautiously climbed out of the landcar , while Oxblood continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waited . The Landship approached to within fifty yards , then forty , then thirty , and I still could n't see the color of his eyes . I could see everything else , though : the enormous musculature of his shoulders , the incredibly flexible lower lip , the myriad of colorful insects dancing around his massive head . I could smell his strong , pungent odor , and I could hear not just his breathing but the rumbling of his stomach . Finally , at fifteen yards , I was able to tell that the eye closest p 24 to me was a pale yellow-orange . I lined up my sights on the point of his left shoulder where all the blood vessels converged , and gently squeezed the trigger  --  and then all hell broke loose . The Landship turned full upon me , howling and screaming at an earshattering volume , while his two companions came racing up to see what had happened to him . He whirled around in a complete circle , then saw me , extended that frightening lower lip toward me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction . I leaped to one side , rolling as I hit the ground , then righted myself and fired three more quick rounds into the creature 's chest . It raced right by me , oblivious to its new wounds , and charged straight at the landcar . Oxblood began maneuvering evasively , but while it staggered once or twice it matched Oxblood 's every move with remarkable agility . Then the car got stuck in a rut , and I thought Oxblood was done for , but just as the Landship got within reach of him , it shuddered once and died . The other Landships pawed the ground nervously , grunting and bellowing , as if trying to work up their courage for a charge . Oxblood jumped out of the landcar , withdrew a knife that had been specially modified for the job at hand , and quickly began removing the eyestones as the bellowing became louder . " Do me a favor , will you ? " he said calmly as I raced up to him . " What ? " I asked breathlessly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 've only got one Landship left on my license . Frighten them away so we do n't have to break the law . " I looked at the two ten-ton creatures that had approached to within one hundred yards of us . " How ? " I asked . " You 're a bright lad , " said Oxblood , never looking up from his work . " You 'll think of something . " p 25 I took my rifle and fired three quick shots in the air . One of the Landships raced off in a panic , but the other , still screaming , uprooted a small tree and hurled it away as if it were nothing more than a twig . " Forty-five more seconds , " announced Oxblood . I fired just in front of the remaining Landship 's feet , hoping that the bits of earth the bullet tore up might sting him . I might as well have been trying to draw blood from that fourinch-thick skin with a dull knife . " It 's not working , " I said nervously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I think he 's going to charge , " I said . " Do you want me to shoot him ? " " What color has he got ? " " I ca n't tell , " I said . " He 's too far away . " " I 'm not wasting my last permit on a Blue , " he said firmly . " Hold him off . " " I 'm open to suggestions , " I replied as the creature began approaching us more rapidly . " Just another second until . . . got it ! " cried Oxblood . " Quick ! Into the landcar ! " We both hurled ourselves into the car just as the Landship launched his charge . The ignition caught when he was thirty yards away , we began backing up when he was ten yards away , and about two minutes later we had pulled far enough ahead of him so that we could get out of reverse gear , spin around , and start moving forward . " Well ? " asked Oxblood . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat from my face . " A hell of a way to make a living , ai n't it ? " he said with a vastly amused smile . p 26 Hardwycke was sitting in a corner on a high-backed chrome chair when I arrived . He looked up from the mindless holographic entertainment he had been watching on his computer and deactivated the machine . " Back again ? " he asked . I nodded . " If you do n't mind , sir , " I said . " Not a bit . I like talking about the old days . " He paused . " Besides , I slept like a log after you left last night . I owe you something for that , if nothing else . " " You have trouble sleeping ? " I asked . " When you 've spent half your life in the bush , you wake up every time you hear the slightest sound . . . or you do n't wake up at all . And they clomp up and down the corridors here as if they 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a glass , then replaced it on a nearby table . " Vitamins , " p 27 he said confidentially . " I read the label . Even got Vitamin E in it ; maybe they 're thinking of fixing me up with one of the nurses . " He grinned at his little joke . " So . . . what were we talking about ? " " You told me about your first Landship . " He nodded reflectively . " That 's right . Hell of an animal , the Landship . Someday , if they ever untie me from all these machines , I think I 'll go back and take one last look at them . " " They 're extinct , sir , " I said , looking at one of the beams of sunlight that illuminated the room and again wondering how a man who had spent so much of his life roaming across Peponi could adjust to this confinement . " Right , " he said , looking out the window with the bored certainty that he would never see a Demoncat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell on some semiambulatory patients whose nurses were taking them out for some air , and he frowned and turned back to me . " Well , it 's probably all for the best . They outlived their time , just like me . I 'm surprised some zoo did n't pick up a few before the end , though . " " They did , " I said . " But Landships did n't take well to captivity . " " Not even on a zoo planet like Serengeti ? " " Evidently not . " " Well , I suppose I ca n't really blame ' em for that , " said Hardwycke . He lit up his pipe . " They belonged just the way they were , free to roam Peponi 's plains and forests . Mind if I smoke ? " he asked , indicating the pipe . " It annoys the staff and keeps the room from feeling too sterile . " " Not at all , " I said . " I did n't know that Landships were forest animals . " He shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the beginning . . . but after everyone started hunting them , they adapted pretty damned fast . " He paused . " You 'd be surprised p 28 at an animal 's capacity to adapt . Take me , for instance : I never had a tent or a bubble as small as this room , and yet I 've been here for eight years . " " When did hunting Landships become so popular ? " I asked , trying to lead him back to the subject . " Right after Jonathan Ramsey wrote up his safari , " said Hardwycke . " When he announced that he was n't going to run for another term as Secretary of the Republic , a bunch of museums got together and paid him to go to Peponi to collect specimens for them . Johnny Ramsey could n't resist the hunt or the publicity  --  I seem to remember that he walked right out of the Secretary 's Mansion on Deluros VIII and onto a ship Fuentes had chartered for him  --  and once he got back , he must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an overnight hero , and suddenly everyone came to Peponi to hunt . Changed the whole industry . Used to be we 'd go hunting alone for eyestones , and maybe sell some Sabrehorns to the Pinkies  --  but now we could make more money leading luxury safaris and letting our clients blow the animals away . So we did , " he concluded simply . " Oxblood , too ? " I asked . Hardwycke shook his head . " No , he just went farther and farther into the bush . I heard that he finally wound up in the Connectors . " " The Connectors ? " " They 're a chain of tropical islands , kind of stepping stones between the Great Eastern Continent and the Great Western . " He paused and quickly hid his pipe beneath the folds of his robe as a nurse poked her head into the room . He waited until she left , then took another long puff , coughed , and continued . " Still , I had three good years with him , and he taught me things about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books . Finally turned over all his Siboni to me , but they were n't to my liking . I took them along on a couple of safaris and finally dumped ' em in favor of the Sorotoba. "  | " Why , if I may ask ? " " Too damned proud and arrogant , " he responded . " They refused to learn Terran , they stole whatever they wanted in broad daylight , they were always taking off in the middle of a safari and then they 'd just show up again a few months later as if nothing had happened . Made the clients feel uncomfortable , too ; the help ai n't supposed to act like it 's better than the employers . Mostly , though , I suppose it was because they managed to break almost every piece of machinery that I owned . " He paused , staring at a small brown avian that fluttered outside his window . " Even old Prumbra , who tried his damnedest to act like a Man , could n't pull it off . He used to beg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out after Landships , but try as I would , I could never convince him that the bullets did n't travel faster the harder he 'd squeeze the trigger . " He pointed to his left ear , which I now noticed was missing its lobe . " The day he jerked the trigger and did this to me , I took the gun away from him permanently . A week later he was gone , and I never saw him again . I suppose he would n't have been satisfied that I 'd given him a fair chance until he 'd shot off both my ears and maybe my nose . " " Yet a member of the Siboni tribe now holds all the marksmanship records on Peponi , " I noted . " Who told you that ? " " I read it . " " Yeah ? " He seemed to consider the remark for a moment , then shrugged . " Just goes to show you : there 's a hell of a difference between hitting a target and facing a charging Landship . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A little more civilized than the Siboni . " He paused thoughtfully . " Hell , everyone was more civilized than the Siboni . " " In what ways ? " " To begin with , the Sorotoba wore clothes . Nothing spep 30 cial , just rags they wrapped around their middles , but it was something . Most of ' em spoke a little Terran ; not much , but enough to make themselves understood . " He paused , as if remembering his Sorotoba employees . " And they wanted to be paid in credits . Poor bastards did n't have anything to spend it on , and they worked for something ridiculous like a credit a day , but if you did n't pay ' em every morning , they did n't go to work . I mean , you could hit ' em and kick ' em and generally raise hell with ' em , but if they did n't get their credit they just sat there and stared right through you . " He shook his head . " Then they 'd come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap booze from some Man or other who was willing to sell to the natives , get so sick they 'd almost die , and be ready to start off on another hunt the next morning . " He shrugged . " Typical wags . " " Wags ? " I repeated , not certain that I 'd heard the word correctly . " Bluegills . " " I 'm afraid I 'm not quite clear . Are wags a particular type of Bluegill ? " He shook his head . " The Republic set up their administrative headquarters at Berengi  --  it was just a clearing by a river back then , though I 'm told that it 's a city of two or three million these days  --  and started passing all kinds of laws . And some of the do-gooders decided that it was insulting to call the natives Bluegills , and decreed that from that day forth we had to call them Worthy Alien Gentlemen . We still called ' em anything we wanted out in the bush , of course , but back in civilized country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An acronym . " " Whatever . Of course , after they threw us out , they decided they did n't want to be wags , either . I do n't know what the hell them call themselves these days . " " Peponites , I would imagine , " I said . " Stupid , " he said . p 31 " Why ? " " It does n't make sense . " " In what way ? " " Does Paradise-ites make sense to you ? " " You 're confusing me again , " I said . " What has Paradise got to do with anything ? " " What the hell do you think Peponi means ? " " I do n't know , " I admitted . " I assumed Peponi was the name of the man who discovered the planet . " " It was opened up by a member of the Pioneer Corps named Edward Ngana . The rule is whoever opens a planet names it . He fell in love with the place and named it Peponi , which means Paradise in Swahili @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've never heard of it . " " An old Earth dialect . Nobody ever heard of it , but Ngana found it in his computer 's memory banks . " " Very interesting , " I said . " Did Ngana settle there ? " " Tried to . Died of fever two months later . They say the Bluegills killed his wife and kids . " Hardwycke paused thoughtfully . " Still , you ca n't blame him for the name : it must have been like Paradise back then , before they started farming all the land and killing off the game , and before the government started sticking its nose into everything . Like I say , I got there a few years too late . But I 'd sit around camp listening to Oxblood talk about the old days , so I know what it was like then . " " What happened after you split up with him ? " I asked . " Did you start hunting Landships for profit , or did you become a safari guide ? " " A little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules and regulations were coming out of the government offices in Berengi , I figured I 'd better get some credentials before they started putting all kinds of restrictions on who could and could n't run a safari . " " It must have been an interesting life , " I commented .  | " Depended on the clients , " he replied . " Some of them were pretty decent folk ; some just wanted to blow away any animal they could get in their sights . Not everyone who killed a Landship was a sportsman or a profiteer , you know  --  some people just like killing things . " He paused . " A couple of ' em even made the Sorotoba look civilized by comparison  --  and that ai n't an easy task . " " What were they like ? " I asked . " The clients or the Sorotoba ? " " Both , " I said . Most people ( said Hardwycke ) think that the Sorotoba are the laziest of all the Bluegills , and Lord knows they can spend whole days sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them for awhile , you realize that it is n't laziness that makes ' em act that way , but inertia . Sit a Sorotoba down and he 'll stay seated all day if you do n't tell him to get up and do something . But on the other hand , give him a chore , and he 's just as happy doing that as sitting around . I lost one particular wag when we were hunting Dashers up in the dry country north of Balimora , which used to be the last town you came to before you reached the desert . His name was Penona , and when I left camp in the morning I told him to dig a well , since we were going to be there for a week or so . When I came back he was dead , drowned in his own well . It was pretty deep , a few feet over his head , and since the Sorotoba come from the desert , most of them do n't know how to swim . Evidently Penona had been digging most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop he just kept it up until the water rushed in and it was too late . Inertia . The Sorotoba were a pretty superstitious lot , even compared to the other Bluegill tribes . It used to drive me crazy . You could spend half a year teaching one of them to be a mechanic , p 33 and if your landcar broke down and he could find the fault immediately , he 'd fix it just as good as a Man could . But if he could n't find what was wrong in five minutes ' time , he 'd just give up on it and explain to you that there was a curse on the vehicle . And even after you 'd fix it yourself and show him what had been wrong , he 'd just smile and answer that your magic was stronger than the curse . Or you could go out on a hunt , alone or with your clients , and if you were successful it was because one of their gods had smiled down upon you . But if your tracker was too hungover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stick and frightened off a record Thunderhead , well , there was a curse on the hunt and nothing good was likely to happen until you all went back to camp so they could slaughter one of their domestic animals or pay a few credits to the local witch doctor . A couple of them even converted to Christianity . It was ludicrous , of course  --  I mean , imagine an alien going to church and carrying a bible around with him . The missionaries would go home happy , and then out would come the Demoncat teeth and the Bush Devil claws , and you knew that the conversion had a lot more to do with getting their hands on another necklace  --  the crucifix in this case  --  than with any spiritual awakening . The ones who did n't unconvert the minute the missionaries left used to go right from church to their local witch doctor 's , which at least kept them occupied and gave them something to do on Sunday . Still , if you treated them well and fed them regularly and understood their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as any of the Bluegills . And the wild ones  --  the ones who had n't had any contact with Men  --  were the best trackers I 've ever seen . Set ' em down in the middle of Berengi or any other city and they 'd be lost in two minutes ' time  --  but stick ' em in the middle of the Southern Desert and they 'd find the only water hole within 200 miles . Sometimes they 'd forget  | where camp was when they did n't like your clients , but on days they felt like it they could track a billiard ball down a paved road . My headman was a Sorotoba named Magadi . Big fellow , heavily muscled , used to laugh all the time . Not real long on brainpower , but none of them were . He ran the camp , kept all the Sorotoba in line , even entertained the clients by juggling a bunch of ten-pound rocks as if they were rubber balls . When he had to lay into the other Bluegills , he 'd do it with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desertion the whole time he worked for me . It got to where he thought he was a Man , and kept complaining about how stupid and unwashed all the Sorotoba were . Even started calling them wags ; it was really kind of funny . He 'd walk around camp yelling " You bloody wags do this ! " and " You lazy wags do that ! " and the clients would practically fall off their chairs laughing . After a while I gave him a uniform  --  a formal waiter 's outfit I bought from a restaurant in Berengi , complete with bowtie  --  and he was so pleased with it he would n't even take it off to wash it . Finally it got to smelling so bad we had to get rid of it , and I thought Magadi would die of a broken heart . My best tracker was a Bluegill named Prinbul . He 'd broken some taboo or other when he was just a kid , and his tribe had thrown him out , and he 'd spent the next twenty years fending for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was just one enormous scar , from the top of his head to the tip of his toes , but I never found a Bluegill who was better at his job . Prinbul had lived with the animals for so long that he pretty much thought like one . Nothing can ruin a safari quicker than having your client waste his Landship license on a blue or a clear  --  with eyestones , color is everything  --  and Prinbul was the only wag I trusted to tell me what color we were stalking . He had this trick of rubbing Landship dung over every inch of his body and then crawling right up to them while the dung masked p 35 his own scent . He was never once wrong about the color of an eyestone . He might have stunk to high heaven , but I gave him one hell of a lot of Landship hearts over the years . He had another trick , too  --  he could teach a Demoncat to come out and get killed by a hunter . I 'd send him off into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less dangerous game , and he 'd kill a couple of wildbuck or Silvercoats over the next two days , drag the bodies over a mile or so of savannah so nothing could miss their scent , hang the carcass from a tree , and then blow some kind of native whistle he had whittled . Whatever Demoncat owned the territory was never far behind , and after three or four days the Demoncat would associate the sound of the whistle with the notion of an easy meal . Then Prinbul would rejoin us , lead us to the spot where he 'd been baiting the Demoncat , and blow his whistle . Worked just about every time . I really hated to lose him . He 'd been working for me for about four years , but he was still pretty much a wild thing , sleeping apart from the other Sorotoba , never learning a word of Terran , eating his food raw , refusing to wear any clothes . One day we were out on safari with a man named Bates , the owner of one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little early in the day , and at one point during a break he ordered Prinbul to clean his gun . Well , like I said , Prinbul did n't speak any Terran , and he would n't have cleaned the gun even if he knew what my client was saying ? cleaning guns is a lot lower on the Sorotoba 's social scale than tracking  --  so he just stood there ignoring the man , and then , before I could stop him , Bates walked up to him and slapped him . He 'd have been better off slapping a Bush Devil ; ten seconds later he was flat on his back , with Prinbul clawing at his face and gnawing on one of his ears . Well , we could n't have the wags feeling free to attack Men , even when it was justified ; after all , there were a hell of a lot more of them than there were of us . The law was right there  | on the books , plain as day , and it did n't change until a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man killed a Bluegill , he was fined fifty credits ; if he did it twice and could n't show just cause , he was fined 500 credits and told to leave the planet . But if a Bluegill struck a man for any reason at all , the penalty was death . I was fond of Prinbul , and I did n't think much of my drunken client , so I let Prinbul escape into the bush . I never saw him again , but at least he stayed alive that way . When we got back to Berengi , Bates pressed charges against me , and it cost me my license for eight months . I took a lot of ragging about being a wag-lover , too , but most of the hunters I knew understood why I had let him escape . We hunters tended to stick together , and Bates got turned down three times before he found a guide to take him out on his next safari . I must say that I did n't lack for action during the time I was without my license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great Western Continent , about 200 miles west of the Connectors , had burned down a couple of settlements and were in a state of open rebellion . I never did find out what caused them to do that ; I do n't think anyone much cared . With Men outnumbered thousands to one , the government had to put the rebellion down fast and worry about the reasons for it later . Even though he did n't know anything about warfare , the government put Fuentes in charge of the human forces , and most of the hunters rushed to join up . It was n't much of a war . We went down there with about a thousand Men and a native contingent perhaps twice that size . There were about 200,000 Sentabels when we got there . After we 'd marched to the western end of their homeland and back up to the Connectors , there were maybe 80,000 left , and they were as pacified a batch of wags as you 'd ever want to see . The whole campaign took exactly five months and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they returned my license early as a way of thanking me . One of the interesting things about the campaign was that we used Dorado and Sorotoba recruits to help us . It was n't hard to get ' em to come along , either ; if a Bluegill was n't a tribal brother , most other Bluegills tended to think of him as a natural enemy . We did n't give them weapons , of course ; it might have been damned hard to get them back . But they served as trackers and runners and cooks and bearers and in any other capacity that we needed them . It was the first time the government thought of having one batch of Bluegills to fight another ; it would n't be the last . Anyway , after I got back into the hunting business , I found old Magadi , rounded up a new batch of Sorotoba , and went back into the bush . Had some interesting clients , too  --  not everyone wanted to blow away Landships and Demoncats . First client I took out was collecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be just perfect . We were out for nine weeks , we shot only seventeen avians , and he thought the safari was a roaring success . My next trip out was with a botanist who would spend his whole day holographing flowers and most of each night putting sprigs of plants into nutrient solutions . By the time I finally took out a client who was looking for Bush Devils and Thunderheads , I was more than ready for it . You know , there are a lot of false notions about what constitutes a good professional hunter . The typical romantic view of him is that of a tall , bronzed , immaculately-clad man who knows Peponi like the back of his hand , speaks every native dialect , never misses what he aims at , and usually makes a play for his client 's wife . I see those bolos about hunters out in the bush and I have yl to laugh . You know what 's the single most important trait a hunter can have ? He 's got to be able to hold his liquor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe five or six hours a day , and you sleep for another seven or eight , which means you 've got at least ten hours of time to fill . Clients fill that time by drinking , and if you do n't drink with them , they get offended , as if you think you 're too good to associate with them . Even Oxblood , who never did any professional hunting himself , warned me about that before I left him , and he was dead right . When they stop drinking with you , things have already gone from bad to worse , and they 're not about to get any better . As for speaking dialects , a hunter knows the dialect of the wags he 's using on safari , and if he 's an old-timer who did a little trading before he took up leading safaris , he might know bits and pieces of three or four other dialects . But Peponi had some two thousand tribes of Bluegills , major and minor , and between them they spoke about 1,800 different languages , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak Bogoda , Kia , Sorotoba , or Sihoni you could get by all right , at least on the Great Eastern Continent ; there was almost always somebody around who understood them . As for the outfits they wear in the holos , they 're damned foolish . Most of the hunters I knew wore shorts . Our legs may not have been all that nice to look at , but when you 're footslogging for miles on end in tropical climates , the last thing you need are long pants . A lot of us wore vests , just to have enough pockets . You were always running out of places to hold things , like compasses , pipes , salt pills , hunting knives , bullets , and maps . And I 've never seen a bolo hunter with an ash bag . We used to dump our pipe ashes into this thin bag and hang it around our necks ; then , when we 'd be stalking an animal , we 'd tap the bag with a finger and see which way the ashes blew ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing . Most of us were pretty good shots  --  you can miss a Dep 39 moncat or a Landship once or twice and maybe survive , but you sure as hell ca n't make a regular habit of it  --  but our notion of an ideal safari would be one where we never had to take a single shot . After all , it was the client who was paying for the privilege , and we were just there to back him up if something went wrong . As for the romance part , I wo n't deny that an occasional hunter would go off with a client 's wife , but it did n't happen all that often . For one thing , it was bad for business : word gets around that a hunter is sleeping with his client 's wife , and he 's going to be a mighty lonely hunter before long . It became kind of an unspoken code with us : you could fool around all you wanted in Berengi or the other towns , but you did n't touch a client 's woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of damned good female hunters ) . Also , just from a practical standpoint , most of us did n't have time for romance on safari . We 'd be up two hours before the clients , organizing the camp , and we 'd be up two hours after they went to bed , breaking down the kitchen and planning the next day 's hunting . Add to that the problem of keeping discipline among your wags , keeping all the machinery in good repair , and drinking with the client , and believe me , the only thing you wanted to do at the end of the day was sleep . Most of the clients I took out were easy enough to get along with ; some of them were n't . When you 'd get a real bastard , the kind of guy who drank too much or started taking drugs in the bush , or took it out on your wags when he missed a shot , you only had a couple of choices . You could put up with his behavior , in the hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You could return immediately to Berengi , which sometimes worked , but you always had to worry about having your license pulled . Or you could bush him . p 40 There 's nothing quite so pathetic as a client who is convinced that he is totally lost in the wilds of an alien planet . You 'd just lead him around in a great big circle , keep him moving until he was ready to drop , send a couple of wags ahead to scare off the game so you could n't shoot anything for the pot , and when you 'd finally come to water tell him it was polluted . Three or four days of that would take the spunk out of anyone . What a hunter really wanted was a client who knew what game he was after , killed it quickly and cleanly , did n't ask too many stupid questions , and understood that the hunter was a middleman between himself and the wags . Lord , you cherished clients like that . What you did n't cherish were the ones who got so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landship that they forgot everything they ever learned about shooting . They 'd take three shots at a Demoncat , miss two and gutshoot him with the third , and then you 'd have to go into the bush after a very angry 700-pound carnivore while they went back to camp for a bath and a shave and some dinner . Old Dunnegan used to tell me that that was the part of hunting he liked best , going into the bush alone to clean up a client 's mistakes . It was just him against the animal , and if the bush was thick enough , it was about as close to a fiftyfifty chance as the animal ever got . Me , I hated it . No two wounded animals ever acted exactly alike . The Thunderheads were the worst , because they 'd race off into the thickest bush around , and then , once they were out of sight , they 'd double back and lie in wait beside their spoor . I called it the Triangle Trap : they never charged until you were within ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a second shot once he walked into a Triangle Trap . You 'd kill him with the first shot , or it was all over for you . Still , for sheer unpredictability , I 'll take the Landship every p 41 time . The closest call I ever had came on a safari on a spring day . The long rains had just finished , and I had a client called Lewellan , who had come out with his teenaged son . The father was a pretty decent sportsman , but the kid would just stand there , petrified , every time he saw anything bigger than a Dasher or a Silvercoat . Anyway , after Lewellan had bagged his carnivores and his Thunderhead , and a couple of the twenty-foot-long millipedes that pass for snakes on Peponi , he decided that it was time to go after his Landship . I suggested that we leave the boy at camp , but both of them insisted that he come along . The father , I know , wanted to make a man out of him ; to this day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway , we set out that morning , and by noon we 'd found some relatively fresh Landship dung . I sent a couple of trackers on ahead while we stopped for lunch . They came back about an hour later to report that there was a herd of about fifty Landships grazing about two miles to the north of us . I did n't see any sense frightening them with the landcar , so we started walking to the north . We caught up with them about two hours later , and I signaled that we should come to a halt about half a mile away . " I 'm going to get a little closer , " I whispered . " When I find out which of them are carrying the right color , I 'll motion to you to join me . " " Right , " said Lewellan . I turned to his son . " Are you okay ? " " I 'm fine , " he said sullenly . " Just point out which one I should aim at and I 'll take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his hands were n't shaking , so I decided to let him try to take his Landship . I tested the wind , approached to within about 300 yards of the nearest of them , then dropped to my belly and snaked my way through the tall grasses until I could finally catch some p 42 color . The big bull nearest to me was a blue , but there were two reds and a yellow right behind him , grazing placidly in the midday sun . I crawled back until I was about 250 yards away , tested the wind once more , then stood up silently , turned to Lewellan and his son , and waved them forward . They joined me a few minutes later , and I carefully pointed out the two bulls with the red eyestones . Lewellan gestured that he wanted his son to have the first shot , and the boy raised his rifle , lined up a Landship in his sights , and fired . The bull went to its knees , but was up instantly , and I could tell that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turned toward us and began charging , and I quickly delivered the fatal shot  --  but while I was doing so I heard five more shots . Lewellan still had n't fired his rifle , but the boy had gone a little bit crazy when the Landship began charging , and was firing at everything he could see . I grabbed the rifle from him and told his father to get him away from the herd , then turned back to see what damage he had done . All hell had broken loose . Four wounded Landships , two bulls , a cow , and a youngster , were screaming in rage and uprooting trees , and the rest of the herd was fast disappearing into a nearby glade of trees . I managed to kill the cow and the baby as they raced for cover , but the two bulls were too far away . " What now , Boss Hardwycke ? " asked one of my trackers . " We shag ' em out for you ? " I shook my head . " No . Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounds time to stiffen . " I turned to my other tracker . " Make sure Boss Lewellan and his son get back to camp . " " Yes , Boss , " he said , and headed off after them at a trot . I sat about 200 yards from the glade for almost an hour . We could still hear the Landships crashing around in among the p 43 trees , and I 've have preferred to wait even longer to let the bullets do their damage  --  but night would fall in another ninety minutes or so , and I decided that it was time to go in after them . H I sent Pelobi  --  my tracker  --  around to the back of the glade to warn me if either of our Landships tried to escape , and then , carrying my rifle across my chest , I cautiously approached the trees and began looking for blood spoor . I was perhaps thirty yards into the glade when I heard some movement off to my left . I dropped to my belly and began wriggling forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came to a small clearing within the glade and there , not ten yards in front of me , was one of my two Landships , an ugly wound right in the middle of his huge pre-hensile lip . I waited until he presented me with a killing shot , then took it and put him out of his misery . The explosion of the rifle precipitated some screaming and bellowing from beyond the clearing , and a moment later a second Landship , his left eyestone shattered by the boy 's bullet , bore down upon me . I turned him with a shot to his chest , then Ij took a heart shot and heard him drop about twenty yards outside the clearing . III Pelobi worked his way to the clearning a moment later . I " You want eyestones , Boss Hardwycke ? " he asked , pulling out his curved knife . pp I shook my head . " One of them 's a blue and one 's a clear , " I said disgustedly . " What about mother and baby ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Pelobi said with a grin . " Boss Lewellan ought to be happy that I did n't kill his son on the spot , " I replied . " Well , let 's get back to camp . " I started to leave , and an instant later Pelobi shouted a warning . p 44 I turned and saw yet another Landship silently bearing down upon me . I dove into the bushes to my right , and he shot by me , missing me by less than three feet . When he realized that he had n't touched me he squealed angrily and wheeled around , testing the air . He was almost on top of me , and I could n't get a clear shot . Then Pelobi threw a heavy branch at him , and as he turned to face his new tormentor , I got a clear brain shot and took advantage of it . The ground seemed to shake as the huge beast fell to earth . " Thanks , Pelobi , " I said when I had finally regained my feet and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Pelobi , pointing to the Landship 's right hind foot . There was a bullet hole in it . " That 's right ! " I said , finally comprehending . " There were five shots , not four . I thought the kid had missed one of them . " " He missed all of them , " said Pelobi . The eyestones were yellow-orange , but I was damned if I was going to give them to Lewellan or his son , so I had Pelobi cut them out and bury them at the edge of the clearing . When we got back to camp late that night , Lewellan was all apologies , and his son was sullen and silent . I decided then and there that the safari was over , and we spent the next two days driving back to Berengi . At one point the boy asked why I had bothered to go after the wounded Landships . I explained that we could n't leave them around to kill the next Men or wags who chanced along , that it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That did it ; the boy did n't say another word until I put him and his father on the ship for Binder X. I filed my report with the Game Authority , which had been upset with me ever since I let Prinbul escape a couple of years earlier . They pointed out that we had killed five Landships but had only been licensed for two . I knew what was coming next : either I could buy three more Landship licenses and p 45 pay a fine , or they were going to have to suspend my hunting license again . So I shelled out something like eight thousand credits , which left me barely enough to replace the ammunition I had used on the safari . Sure was romantic , safari life . p 46 " Legends ? " said Hardwycke . He was sitting up in his bed , looking a little weaker than the last time I saw him , but as always he seemed enthusiastic when we began speaking of Peponi . " Hell , yes , there were legends galore  --  and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being born with the mark of a prophet on him , or coming down from the mountains to lead his people to freedom . Peponi was still a frontier world when I was there , and we had frontier legends . " " Tell me about them , " I urged him . " Well , most of ' em are probably forgotten by now , but there was a time about sixty years ago when a hell of a lot of people were looking for the Landship Ruby . " " What was that ? " I asked . " I do n't know how the story got started , but rumor had it that there was a massive Landship , bigger than any that had p 47 ever been seen , up in the high country at the western end of the Great Eastern Continent . He was supposed to carry scars from every type of weapon  --  projectile , laser , even a molecular imploder  --  but no one had come close to killing him . " Hardwycke was suddenly seized by a paroxysm of coughing . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call a nurse , but finally it subsided . " Breathe in all that dust for half a century and eventually it comes back to haunt you , " he muttered after he had regained his breath . " Are you sure you 're all right ? " I asked . " I have n't been all right for thirty years , " he said wryly . " But I can keep talking , if that 's what you mean . " " That was what I meant . " " Where were we ? " " The Landship Ruby . " " Right , " he said , nodding . " Anyway , this enormous Landship was supposed to have a ruby embedded in his forehead , a perfect ruby bigger than any eyestone ever seen . Silly , is n't it ? " He paused . " Still , a lot of men went out looking for him . Most of ' em never came back . They still say that old Kansas Pierce found him and got killed for his trouble , but nobody ever proved anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many wags swore they 'd seen him , though . " " Had they ? " " Of course not . But lying comes naturally to them . It 's not that they 're deceitful . They just do n't want to disappoint you , so they tell you what they think you want to hear . Same thing with directions . You 'd come to a Bluegill village out in the middle of nowhere , and ask where the nearest herd of Thunderheads was , and they 'd point you in the right direction , but whether it was a five-hour march or a five-day march to reach them , the Bluegills would always swear that they were just over the next hill . Once in a while I 'd get so frustrated when they 'd lie about how far it was to water that I 'd come back p 48 and thrash the hell out of the headman , but it was n't really their fault ; they were just responding the way they 'd been trained to respond . Still , you tended to forget that when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bush , looking for Landships , and you knew damned well that there was n't anything bigger than a Mouse Rat within ten miles of you . " He reached weakly toward his nightstand . " You want to hand me that pipe ? " " Are you sure you 're allowed to ? " I asked , still worried about the way he had looked during his coughing spell . " I 'm sure I 'm not allowed to , " he said . " So what ? I 'm stuck in this damned room , I ca n't see fifty feet out the window even if there was anything to see , I ca n't even stand up without help . If indulging in the one pleasure left to me kills me a day or two sooner , it wo n't be any great loss . " I shrugged , got to my feet , walked over to the nightstand , and handed him the pipe . " Thanks , " he grated . " You 're welcome . " " You know , " he continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most expensive damned habit I had on Peponi . The wags had been brewing their own beer long before the Republic ever discovered the place , and the first factory built in Berengi was a distillery , but for some reason tobacco just did n't grow well there . There were a couple of local brands , but they were so strong you 'd swear a Landship could smell the stuff three or four miles away . I always bought tobacco imported from Pollux IV or New Rhodesia , and let me tell you , it sure as hell was n't cheap . Still , " he added , " I do n't know what I 'd have done without it . " He filled the pipe carefully , tapped down the tobacco , and lit it . " Tame stuff , this , " he said , referring to the tobacco . " Still , I suppose it 's all I can handle these days . " " You mention tobacco and alcohol all the time , " I noted , " but you never speak about drugs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could take a rifle and drive a nail into a tree two hundred yards away when they were dead drunk , " replied Hardwycke . " Never yet saw a man you could count on when he was full of drugs . And there was an old saying among Peponi 's hunters : Everything Bites . We were usually after the Big Five : Landships , Sabrehorns , Thunderheads , Bush Devils , and Demoncats . But even a Silvercoat or a Dasher could impale you on his horns . A Dust Pig could make pudding out of you if you were n't on your guard , and a Treetop had a kick that could kill a Demoncat , let alone a man . You could footslog for three days without seeing a living thing , and the second you relaxed there 'd be something hiding behind a bush or up on a tree limb that was just dead set on making you his lunch . Times like that , a man needs his head on right ; there was no place in the bush for drugs . I know a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or later they all came around to that point of view . A client drinks a pint of whiskey at night , you can pretty much tell in the morning how he 's going to react , and if you do n't like what you see , you stay in camp for the day . . . but you could never tell what a man would do when he was on drugs . There were more than enough ways to die in the bush without adding stupidity to the list . " He paused . " Couple of Bluegill tribes I know of used to chew the leaves of a plant called the Meridota . It put ' em in kind of a trance . " He took a deep puff from the pipe and coughed slightly . " They 're still out in the bush , chewing Meridota leaves and living in mud huts and staring at the sun , while the rest of ' em are building cities and pretending to be Men . " " Did any of the animals chew the Meridota ? " I asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid as some people think . Only one I ever saw munching on Meridota was a little avian called the Purpletip , and I later found out that Purpletips were immune to it . " Suddenly he chuckled . p 50 " What is it ? " I asked . " Look at me , " he said . " Here I am , railing on about drugs , and I 've got half a dozen tubes carrying all kinds of stuff into my veins . " " But you 're not in the bush , " I pointed out . " True enough , " he said , his smile replaced by an expression of regret . He remained motionless for a moment , then suddenly looked up at me . " What were we talking about ? " " Legends , " I answered him . " Ah , yes , " he said . " Well , there were always lost gold and diamond mines . A tourist could n't get two steps off the ship before someone was selling him an authentic map to an authentic lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he added with an amused chuckle . " Most of ' em never did get themselves found . " He paused thoughtfully . " After I 'd been on Peponi for thirty years or so , I started hearing all kinds of rumors about human goddesses living out among the Bluegills . " " Were Bluegills supposed to have produced them ? " I asked dubiously . " Of course not , " he replied . " In most of the stories , they were girls who 'd been stolen from their parents ' farms and raised as Bluegills . Lot of people went out looking for ' em , too ; in fact , though not many people knew it even back then , that 's what Ramirez was looking for when he discovered diamonds in the Great Western Desert . " " Were all the legends about goddesses , or were there any about gods ? " " Going into the bush after a man ai n't quite as romantic , " responded Hardwycke wryly . " Funny thing , though  --  the only one they ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He nodded . " Nobody ever did find out where he came from or how he got there , but one day Bushveldt Tesio found him living with some Bluegills on the outskirts of the Northern p 51 Desert . He could n't speak any Terran at all , he lived on raw fish , he walked kind of hunched over and swinging his arms like the wags do . Tesio bought him from the Bluegills and took him back to his farm and tried to raise him like a Man , but he died a couple of months later . " " Were there any stories of feral children ? " I asked . " Kids raised with animals ? Yeah , there was supposed to be one up above the polar circle , running with a pack of those shaggy white carnivores they 've got up there , but nobody ever found him . " He paused . " Had some men go feral , but I suppose that ai n't the same thing . There was Hakira , who lived in a cave with his Demoncat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shack out by the Rashar River and keeping about fifty big millipedes as pets , and I remember a woman called Mercer or Mersin or something like that who actually tamed a pack of Nightkillers . Of course , by the time I left Peponi , there were so many scientists living with the animals while they studied ' em that they were practically tripping over each other , especially out on the Siboni Plains . " " Did you ever go off searching for a legend ? " I asked . " Just once , " he replied . I was in Berengi between safaris ( said Hardwycke ) , and I was staying at the old Royal Hotel , like most of the hunters did when they were in town . A bunch of us were gathered around the Thunderhead Bar in the lobby , mostly talking about Fuentes . He 'd just left Peponi for good , saying that it was getting too damned crowded , that the farmers and colonists had ruined the place , and we were feeling pretty glum , because he truly was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was ironic that he was the leader of Johnny Ramsey 's safari , and that Ramsey had put Peponi on the map and made it so popular that Fuentes could n't stand it any longer . Still , it was n't just the safari business that had changed the shape of the planet . All you had to do was go into Berengi p 52 every few months and you could practically see it change right in front of your eyes . When I arrived on Peponi , Berengi had maybe three hundred people , and was mostly two blocks of prefab shops and buildings . By the time Fuentes left it had a population of 16,000 , and the police were leaning on us not to upset the locals when we came into town to blow off steam . You used to be able to stand by the window of your room in the Royal and pot Landships and Sabrehorns as they grazed on the hotel 's lawn ; now you could n't find anything bigger than a Willowbuck within five miles of town . You 'd come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were n't even sure you were still on Peponi : there was nothing but farmland as far as the eye could see . Sure , there 'd be an occasional herd of Silvercoats grazing by roadside , and the meat farmers complained that there were still a few Bush Devils in the area , but it sure as hell was n't like the old days . When I landed on Peponi , I walked all the way to Oxblood 's camp , because there were only about twenty landcars on the whole planet ; by the time Fuentes left , there was bus service among all the nearby towns , and a weekly airplane between the continents . Berengi 's streets were getting so full of traffic that they actually had to erect stoplights , and it could take you twenty minutes to walk from the Equator Hotel to the Royal . There were two brand-new hotels for tourists , and a couple of nightclubs to keep them happy while they were waiting to go out on safari . The Bluegills had started moving into town , too , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the outskirts . They hawked their crafts to the tourists , and set up a big market about half a mile south of the Royal . Anyway , we were sitting around the Thunderhead Bar , swapping reminiscences about Fuentes , and at one point Jumbo Neysmith asked if Fuentes had ever found the Golden Kingdom . Nobody knew what he was talking about , so he told us that he and Fuentes had been hunting Dashers down p 53 by the Connectors when they heard the legend of a city made entirely of gold , that was n't run by Men or Bluegills but by some humanoid race that no one had ever seen . Neysmith was n't interested , but Fuentes had a contract for another book , so he began questioning the wags who mentioned the city and started taking notes . " Did he ever find it ? " asked Bocci . " Never even went looking for it , as far as I know , " answered Neysmith . " I guess it 'll just be a footnote in his next book . " Someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smack dab in the middle of the Impenetrable Forest , " said Neysmith , " halfway across the Great Western Continent , maybe a thousand miles north of where Ramirez found his diamond mine . " " Figures , " said Bocci . " What do you mean ? " I asked . " Anybody makes his way through that forest deserves to find a golden city , " he said . " There 's places there where it rains every minute of every day , and places where the sun has never pierced through the branches to touch the ground . " " You 've been there ? " asked Neysmith . " On the edges , " answered Bocci . " Terrible place . You ca n't get warm and you ca n't get dry , your clothes rot away and your weapons do n't work , and they must have five hundred diseases that have n't even got names yet . Ai n't worth going there just to find the Balguda . " " You have heard of it ! " exclaimed Neysmith . " You know their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribe of humanoids in there called the Balguda , " replied Bocci . " I ai n't ever heard of no Golden Kingdom . " " You were n't curious enough to look for it ? " persisted Neysmith . " I told you  --  I never even heard of it , " said Bocci . " Besides , even if I had , it ai n't worth the effort . " p 54 " Since when is plundering a city of gold not worth the effort ? " asked someone else . " You ever been to the Impenetrable Forest ? " asked Bocci contemptuously . " It 's eight hundred miles across , and you need a machete or a panga ten feet into it . " " Use a laser gun . " " And set fire to the whole damned thing ? " retorted Bocci with a dry laugh . " A laser gun will set even that wet wood to blazing . " He paused . " Besides , get anywhere near the middle of it and you 'd be footslogging through two or three feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetual thunderstorm . " " Has anyone ever tried to spot it from overhead ? " I asked . " Ca n't see nothing from up top , " said Bocci . " Those trees are a couple of hundred feet high , and there are two or three canopies of interlaced branches . Hell , there 's probably twenty species of animal in there that no one 's ever seen . " " Maybe twenty-one , " said Neysmith meaningfully . " Bah ! " snorted Bocci . " Fuentes had the right idea . He 'll make more money writing ' em up than you 'll ever make looking for ' em . " " I 'm due to take a client out that way next week , " I said . " Maybe I 'll take a look . " " You 'd be wasting your time , " said Bocci firmly . " It 's my time , " I said . " And your client 's . " " Maybe I 'll look around after I send him home , " I said . " Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a camera hunter . This is his third trip here , and he 's got most of the holos he needs from the Great Eastern Continent . " " Want some company ? " asked Neysmith . " Not really , " I said . " I could be your meat hunter , " he persisted . " If you 're so hot to find this Golden Kingdom , why have n't you looked for it before now ? " I asked . p 55 Suddenly a guilty look spread over his face . " I have . " " How many trips ? " asked Bocci . " Five , so far . " " Waste of time , " reiterated Bocci . " I 've got time to waste , " replied Neysmith . He turned to me . " But I do n't have any more money . That 's why I need to hire on with you . " I shrugged . " Okay , " I said . " Come along as my meat hunter , and we 'll spend a couple of weeks nosing around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a deal , " he replied . " And if we find the Golden Kingdom , we split fifty-fifty . " " Sixty-forty , " I said . " Do n't forget  --  it 's my safari . " " Sixty percent of nothing is nothing , " said Bocci sardonically . I shared his opinion , but what the hell , I 'd gotten myself out of the chore of meat-hunting for a couple of months , so as far as I was concerned I was ahead of the game already . I stayed in Berengi another six days , waiting for my client , a pleasant little man named Walker , to arrive . I always enjoyed blowing off steam in Berengi for a day or two , but by the third day I usually got to wishing I was back in the bush . Cities , even small ones like Berengi , did n't appeal to me , and after a couple of days in town a hunter would come to realize that even though the safari business had never been better , he was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by people who want a permanent home , and farms are worked by people who are tied to the land ; those of us with wanderlust in our souls may be necessary in the beginning , but we 're just passing through . Some , like Fuentes , leave early , and some , like me , leave a little later , but eventually all of us leave . Every paved street , every house with a solid foundation , every cultivated piece of land , is just another nail in our coffins . In fact , on the day I left with Walker and Neysmith , the p 56 government gazetted the first national park . They took almost three thousand square miles right in the middle of the Siboni Plains and outlawed all hunting . I think I knew then and there that my days on Peponi were numbered . It was n't outlawing hunting ; it was the damned fences , even if they were just lines on a map . Still , it was easy to ignore all that once you set out across the savannah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major town on the Great Western Continent , and the next morning we were driving across the grasslands , with Magadi and two of my Sorotoba trackers in tow . The Silvercoats were migrating up from the south , and they brought with them their attendant carnivores and scavengers . In fact , there was so much food on the hoof that even the Nightkillers , which would usually eat anything , were actually getting fussy about which carcass they would take after one of the big carnivores was done with it . The rains had just ended , and it seemed like all of Peponi was green and in flower . Rivers that had been dry scars on the earth just a month ago were filled with rushing water , and most of the grasseaters had young with them . It made me happy that I was out with a camera hunter this time and that Neysmith was in charge of procuring meat for the table ; it was pleasant just to lean back and enjoy the scenery for a change . We spent three weeks getting Walker the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the spaceport in Berengi , and then set out for the Impenetrable Forest . We drove due west for almost four days , making about 200 miles per day over rough terrain , and finally we came to the forest 's outskirts . The land began getting hillier and more heavily-wooded , and before long most of the animals that relied on sight and speed , like the Silvercoats and Dashers , were left behind . There were scattered herds of Landships and Thunderheads , and an occasional Sabrehorn , but mostly we saw various species of wildbuck  --  I brought one back that had never been classified p 57 before , and got it named after myself  --  and a number of Treecrawlers , chattering and swinging overhead from limb to limb . Neysmith pulled out a map and showed me where he had made his unsuccessful forays into the forest , and we eventually decided on a route that would take us south and west . We made it another fifteen miles before the forest became so dense that we had to leave the car and continue on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind with the car , while Neysmith and I took the two Sorotoba trackers with us . We footslogged into the forest for two days , probably not making more than ten miles a day . I never saw so many insects or millipedes in my life , and we had to stop every couple of hours to burn some tiny bloodsuckers off our feet . On the night of the second day it started raining , and it did n't stop . We spent a day in our minibubbles before we realized that it was n't going to stop anytime in the foreseeable future , and so we began walking again . The two wags started complaining about evil spirits , but we proceeded for another day and a half before I decided we had gone far enough . " What about the Golden Kingdom ? " demanded Neysmith . " To hell with it , " I said , pulling the hundredth or maybe the thousandth insect out of my ear . " At the rate we 're going , we could spend half a year walking and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My own guess is that we have n't traveled thirty miles total . Whoever named it the Impenetrable Forest knew what he was talking about . " Well , he threw a fit and did everything but threaten me with his sonic pistol , but I remained adamant . I 'd had enough of bugs and rain and cold . " Well , I 'm not quitting ! " said Neysmith , picking up his backpack . " You 're free to do anything you want , " I said . " I never wanted to give you sixty percent anyway , " he said . " To quote our friend Bocci , one hundred percent of nothing p 58 is nothing , " I said . " We 'll wait a day by the landcar , just in case you change your mind . " He just glared at me contemptuously and then turned and went off down an animal trail . I told the wags we were going back , and for the first time in four days they started smiling and singing . And then the strangest thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found their way home blindfolded from Balimora or even the Jupiter Mountains , got hopelessly lost . They had marked our trail , of course , but nothing stays marked in that damned forest . The rain had obliterated our tracks , and enough animals had rubbed against the trees that all of the marks were gone . We wandered through that damned forest for close to a week , but there was no way to tell where we were . My compass , which was supposed to be waterproof , had stopped working , and we could n't see the sun or the stars because of the clouds and the terraced branches . There was enough game so that we were in no danger of starving , and we certainly were n't about to die of thirst , but it was the closest I 've ever come to panicking on safari . We could n't just sit there , and yet we did n't know for a fact that every step we took was n't taking us farther from the landcar and deeper into the interior of the forest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going the wrong way , at least we might wind up seeing the Golden Kingdom before we died , and I decided that I 'd have traded the view and the riches for just seeing the sun one more time . Then one morning one of the Sorotoba pounded on the door of my minibubble , and I walked out to find myself confronted by half a dozen of the strangest-looking Bluegills I 'd ever seen . They were half again as tall as the normal wag , skinny as rails , and covered with incredibly complex designs that had been burned into their hides . It took about half a minute to learn that they did n't speak PARADISE : A CHRONICLE OF A DISTANT WORLD 59 any of the common dialects , so we tried communicating by sign language . I managed to convey our predicament to them , and they volunteered to lead us back , if not to the landcar , at least to the forest 's edge . It was then that I noticed that two of them were wearing golden ankle bracelets . I pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , but I could n't make myself understood . Finally , just as a shot in the dark , I gestured at the lot of them and asked , " Balguda ? " It got a reaction , sure enough . I was expecting them either to smile and nod , or to look blank , but instead they began frowning and one of them raised a sharp stick that he used as a spear and threatened me with it . They calmed down after a moment , and I made no further references to gold or the Balguda . It seemed certain to me that they 'd heard of the Balguda , and just as certain that they were n't on friendly terms with them , which was fine by me : all I cared about was getting out of that damned rain forest . I thought we were in for at least a week 's trek , but we actually came to Magadi and the landcar in less than two days . When I activated the car and showed them how it worked , two of them raced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at it in amazement . I brought down a Taylor 's wildbuck for dinner  --  the rifle did n't surprise them at all , which led me to believe they 'd seen them before  --  and invited them to stay and share our meal . They spent the entire night with us , and then sat around the . landcar in the morning , waiting to watch it speed off . Through still more signs , I finally got them to understand that we were waiting for Neysmith , and that we 'd probably spend a couple of days in this location before we gave up on him and went home . Finally they nodded , bade us farewell , and trotted off . I spent the rest of the morning cleaning and polishing my p 60 weapons . Then , just after noon , the tallest of them returned and walked slowly across the little clearing to the landcar , carrying something in his hand . As he got closer , I could see that it was Neysmith 's head . I drew my pistol and trained it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gestures , that he had n't killed him . I asked who did , and he pointed toward the forest in a manner that led me to believe that the killer or killers were some considerable distance away . " Balguda ? " I asked . He nodded . I tried to get him to describe a Balguda , or to tell me where they lived , but he just kept grimacing and shaking his head , and finally I gave it up . At last he placed Neysmith 's head on the ground and faded back into the forest . " Well , at least he found his Balguda , whatever the hell they are , " I said after a moment . " Do you suppose there really is a Golden Kingdom , Boss Hardwycke ? " asked Magadi curiously . " After all , these wags " ? he uttered the word contemptuously , as always ? " certainly did n't make the gold anklets they were wearing . " " You know , " I said , " the answer to that was a lot more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . " That was true then , and it 's true now . pI 61 Hardwycke 's color was bad , and he seemed to have lost even more weight . For the first time since I 'd known him , the curtains were drawn over his window , as if he no longer cared for the sunlight . " Welcome back , Mr. Breen , " he said weakly , when I entered the room . " I was afraid you would n't make it back in time . " " In time ? " I repeated curiously . " I coughed up a lot of blood last night . I 'm not supposed to know it , but they expect me to die in the next couple of days . " I did n't know what to say , so I merely stared at him . " No great loss , " he said . " It 's past time anyway . " " I 'm sorry . " " I 've made my peace , " said Hardwycke . " I brought nothing to Peponi , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have p 62 hated to go without answering all your questions . After all , I 'm the last  --  there 's nobody left once I 'm dead . " " Are you sure you 're up to it ? " I asked . He smiled ironically . " It 's not as if I 've got any other pressing engagements . " He paused for a moment . " How 's your book coming ? " " It 's a thesis , " I said . " Though , with your permission , I think I might write a book as well . " " Do n't need my permission to write about Landships . " " Not about Landships , " I responded . " About you . " He tried to shrug , but was too weak . " Suit yourself , " he said at last . " Thank you , " I said . " But try to make it accurate , " he continued slowly . " Hunting ai n't as exciting or romantic as the bolos and the videos make it out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting Landships was that you walked twenty miles for every shot you took . " " Really ? " He nodded , coughed once , and struggled to catch his breath . " And any hunter might find his life in danger once or even twice during his career , but anything more than that was either carelessness or sheer foolishness . " I paused to consider my next question . " Why did n't you stay ? " I asked . " On Peponi ? " " Yes . " " Almost none of us did . " " I know , " I said . " But I do n't know why . If you 'd opened up some other worlds , it would have made sense to me , but you did n't . Fuentes retired to Deluros VIII , Ramirez went to Earth . Each of you seems to have retired rather than started anew  --  so why did n't you retire right there on Peponi ? " " Catamount Greene stayed behind , " he responded , seeming to draw some strength from his interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always had an angle ; I remember once he bought Mount Krakwa from the Bogoda for six Dashers . Went out and shot ' em all in one afternoon . " Hardwicke smiled at the memory , then became serious . " As for me , I did n't like what Peponi was becoming . Oh , it was inevitable that it would get civilized , but that did n't make it any easier to take . Once you 've seen paradise , you do n't like to watch it become just another world . " " It still had vast tracts of unsettled land when you left it , " I pointed out . He gasped for breath again , then held very still for a moment , and finally answered my question . " Everything was mapped , " he said . " Once you 've got maps , you 've got boundaries , and once you 've got boundaries , you 've got titles and deeds . What you do n't have is Peponi , not the way I knew it . " He paused . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was time to get out or start thinking about becoming a farmer or a shopkeeper , and settling down just was n't to my taste . " " Why did so few of you open other worlds ? " I persisted . " Peponi was like a greedy mistress , " he replied . " The more you offered her , the more she took . She took your youth , and your energy , and your health  --  everything you had to give . It takes a lot out of a man to civilize a world , and it 's selfdefeating in the end , because the kind of man who does it does n't want to see the results . " He paused again , longer this time . " There just was n't anything left to give to another world . The sun would take all the life from your skin , the diseases would sap your strength , the dust would get into your lungs and never leave them . " Suddenly he smiled . " And there is n't a hunter anywhere in the galaxy who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days when he was stupid enough to stand in front of his client . " " Once you left , did you ever keep in touch with any of the people you knew there ? " p 64 " No , " he said . " I ran into Bocci once or twice , and every now and then I 'd hear that Johnny Ramsey had made another speech or written another book . But I never sought any of them out . " " Why not ? " " What for ? To sit around and moan about what they had done to our planet ? " He paused . " You know , I met a couple of youngsters who went there to fight against Buko Pepon a few years back , and it was like they were describing a different world . Nothing sounded like the Peponi I knew . " " When did you make up your mind to leave ? " I asked . " After I came out of the Bukwa Enclave , " he said . " A lot of us left then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so it seemed a good time to leave . " " You were in the Bukwa Enclave ? " I said , surprised . " Hell , anyone with a gun was there . " " I read Taylor 's account of it , " I continued . " He never mentioned you . " Hardwycke snorted contemptuously , and his anger seemed to renew his strength . " Henry Taylor was the biggest liar anyone ever met . " " Oh ? " " He never set foot in the Enclave . Got all his stories hanging around bars in Berengi , and then wrote himself up as the Great Landship Killer . " " Who was there ? " " Well , there was me , and Catamount Greene , and Hakira , and Bocci , and old Ephraim Oxblood came back from the Connectors for it , and Starmount , and Bailey , and Rashid , and the Paris Brothers , and Gabe Pickett , and ? " " Gabriel Pickett ? " I interrupted . " That 's right . " " Was n't he the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . "  | " I 've read all of her books , " I said . " I thought his name sounded familiar . " " Damned good writer , Amanda Pickett , " commented I lardwycke . " I seem to remember that Gabriel Pickett was a farmer , not a hunter . " " He was  --  but most farmers did a little Landship poaching on the side to help pay off their mortgages . " He smiled again . " I noticed that that little tidbit did n't make it into any of Amanda 's books . " " Did you ever meet her ? " " Long time ago . She was just a kid back then . Shy little thing , quiet and standoffish . No way in the world you could look at her and guess she was going to become Peponi 's most famous writer . " He paused . " She came by it honestly , though ; Gabe Pickett kept the most thorough diaries of any man I ever knew . " " He did ? " Hardwycke nodded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be of interest to you . " " I 'm sure they would , " I said . " Perhaps I 'll try to hunt her up one of these days . " " Could n't hurt , " he agreed . " Last I heard , she was living on Barton IV . " A nurse entered just then to refill some of the medications that were dripping slowly down the tubes that led into his left arm and leg , and I turned my head away until she was finished . " It 's okay to look now , " rasped Hardwycke when she had left the room . He smiled in amusement . " I 'd have loved to watch your face the first time you saw an animal being skinned . " " It would have been worth the price of admission , " I admitted , somewhat embarrassed . " Do n't let it bother you , " he said . " Different things affect p 66 different people . You do n't like the sight of blood . Me , I never could stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last eight years in this tiny room , and I did n't know what to say . He seemed to read my mind , because he said , " Ai n't nothing to see out there anyway . " " Are you up to talking about the Bukwa Enclave ? " I asked gratefully . " Might as well , " he said . " It was the last great hunt on s Peponi . " He paused . " I 'll say this for us : we sure as hell went out with a bang instead of a whimper . " What you have to understand about the Bukwa Enclave ( said Hardwycke ) is that everything came together at once . To begin with , the planetary Governor decided that Peponi was too big for one man to keep tabs on everything , so he divided it up into twelve districts , each with its own District Commissioner . Eleven Commissioners were in place within a month , but the twelfth , the one whose territory included the Bukwa Enclave , was in a hospital halfway across the galaxy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also , a little war had erupted on Columbus II , which was less than two light years away , and about three-quarters of Peponi 's military personnel were transferred there for the duration . Then came the news that the Republic 's jewelers were so desperate for eyestones that they would now accept blues and clears . So what you had was a situation in which the military was no longer out there enforcing the law , the Bukwa district had no Commissioner , and you could sell any eyestone you could take , no matter what color . This led to virtually an open season on Landships , and the highest concentration of Landships on the planet was the Bukwa Enclave , a huge savannah between the Jupiter Mountains and the Dust Bowl . p 67 Once the word went out that the jewelers were buying , everyone  --  and I mean everyone  --  headed up to the Enclave . It was n't just the hunters ; I mean , hell , there were never that many of us to begin with . But hundreds of farmers like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined by miners and traders . I never saw them , but I heard stories that there were even some Bluegills up there , operating entirely on their own . Catamount Greene was one of the first to arrive . He 'd been living in Berengi , scrounging for credits here and there , ever since the government made him give up being the Human King of the Bogoda , and he did n't know the first thing about tracking , but old Catamount never let minor details like that stop him . On the way to the Enclave he stopped by his old stamping grounds and picked up a bunch of trinkets and jewelry from the Bogoda , then found one of the few military outposts left in the Bukwa area and explained that he was trading Bogoda artifacts to the wags who lived in the Enclave . He gave a few of the better ones to the soldiers , bought them a couple of drinks , and went on to say that he was terrified of Landships and that he had heard that the Enclave was filled with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marking where the herds were on a map so that he could avoid them while he hawked his wares from village to village . He walked into the Enclave with one weapon , three bearers , and his map , and walked out a month later with more than 3,000 eyestones . Bocci , who had made up his mind to leave Peponi , stuck around just long enough to clean up in the Enclave . He found a water hole way out at the western end , staked it out , poisoned it , and picked up 700 eyestones without ever firing a shot . Jumping Jimmy Westerly went in with a stepladder , took it out in the shoulder-high grass where none of the other hunters would go , climbed atop it , and potted twenty Landp 68 ships the first day he was there . Once they cleared out of the area , he followed them , always keeping to high grass . He 'd set up his ladder again whenever they stopped , and he kept right on doing it until he had his thousand eyestones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole tribe of Dorado , who used poisoned spears and arrows and brought down almost three thousand Iandships before the new Commissioner finally showed up and the soldiers returned from Columbus II . After a couple of months , the Enclave began to resemble a war zone , and I do n't just mean the piles of Landship carcasses . First of all , a lot of the farmers really did n't know much about hunting , and more than half a hundred of them were killed by Landships . Then , as the Landships themselves started getting harder to find  --  the ones who survived did n't want to go anywhere near anything that smelled like a Man or a Bluegill  --  some of the hunters started marking off territories . Kalahari Jenkins took a dry area , about forty miles square , at the northwestern tip of the Enclave , announced that it was his personal hunting ground , and swore he 'd kill anyone who wandered into it . A miner named Kennedy wandered in one day , chasing a couple of Landships , and Jenkins blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy had six sons , and this started a blood feud . Lasted a couple of weeks before they killed him  --  I seem to remember that he got four of them first  --  and then the two remaining sons declared that it was now their territory . That lasted about five days , until Hakira came up from the south with that damned Demoncat of his . The Demoncat killed the last two Kennedy boys , and Hakira never fired a shot ; he just gathered up all of Jenkins ' and the Kennedys ' eyestones and lit out for Berengi . Nobody ever found out what happened to the Maracci Sisters . They were damned good hunters , those girls  --  but one  | day they just disappeared , both of'em , and no one ever found the 800 eyestones they were supposed to have taken . After about five months , word began coming back from Berengi that the price on eyestones had dropped because so many were coming in , so those of us up in the Enclave started going after other stuff as well , Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value . I never did see a Sabrehorn , but they say that Bocci killed the very last one on the planet up in the Enclave . After a while , even the scavengers could n't keep up with the abundance of carcasses , and the place became a charnel house , with Landship carcasses everywhere . Some of the Nightkillers got overly bold and started attacking humans , and we damned near had a war on our hands for a while there ... but after a while the few remaining packs of Nightkillers went back to eating Landships . Then the District Commissioner finally arrived . He started making all kinds of pronouncements , but he was powerless to do anything until he got his soldiers back from Columbus , and by then there were n't enough Landships left to make hunting them worthwhile . When the dust had cleared , the best estimates were that less than five hundred men had gone into the Bukwa Enclave , and that in less than six months three million eyestones had come out . It was the last great hunt , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunes were made there . Only about half the men who went in came out , but most of them never had to worry about money again . They took Catamount Greene to court and charged him with poaching . That was nothing new  --  they were always taking him to court over something or other , and he always beat the charges , just like he beat this one . But they took about twelve other hunters to court , including Bocci and Hellfire Bailey , and some of them did n't beat the charge . Their money p 70 was confiscated , and they were given a choice : five years in jail or take the next ship off Peponi and never come back . I went to the trials , and as I sat in the back of the courtroom , I realized that we were n't being judged by any jury of our peers . Hell , all of our peers were dead or on trial . I looked around the room , and all I saw were settlers and farmers and merchants , and you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Fuentes and Hakira and even Johnny Ramsey an embarrassment . You know how you feel ashamed of the way you used to act when you were a kid ? Well , they were ashamed of the men who opened up Peponi . Oh , they knew that what we did was necessary , but you could tell that they had decided times were changing and we had outlived our usefulness . They even asked the planetary Governor to testify , and he promised in no uncertain terms that he would bring the full power of the government to put an end to poaching . He did n't stop there , either . He announced that he was going to regulate hunting much more carefully , and that Peponi was creating fifteen game parks to go with the one they 'd gazetted on the Siboni Plains . He started rattling off the locations , and I realized that I had just been put out of business : every area I had ever hunted was going to become an animal preserve . It did n't matter much by then , because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all those faces and listened to the official pronouncements , and you knew that Peponi was changing too fast . Oh , there 'd be hunting for another twenty or thirty years , but it was on the way out . Navy teams were coming in to map out unexplored territories , even the Impenetrable Forest . The hotels did n't want us coming into town and blowing off steam after a safari , and suddenly Main Street was lined with a batch of safari companies that no one had ever heard of , each of them offering their clients seven exotic worlds in less than a Galactic Standard month . They promised to pick a client up at his hotel , fly him right to the edge of a p 71 herd of Landships , give him an hour of thrills while he shot his trophy , and get him back to the Royal Hotel in time for a late lunch and an evening of pub-hopping and native entertainment . I stuck around a few months , hoping I might find something that would convince me I was wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a park warden . I almost took one ; I got as far as negotiating the right to do some limited hunting , just for my dinner pot , but in the end I turned it down . Nothing wrong with the kind of people who come out to the parks , but they were n't my kind of people . I could understand camera buffs like Walker , who I 'd taken out four or five times ; he 'd stand there taking holos of a charging Demoncat and get furious with me if I tried to turn it before it got within ten yards of him , or he 'd climb into a tree to get a holo of a Bush Devil eating a Silvercoat it had dragged up there to keep it safe from scavengers . But I had no interest in the kind of camera hunters who would drive across the parks , intent only on the number of animals they could bolo in a day 's time , and I had a feeling they would outnumber the Walkers by hundreds to one . Then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had set up shops in Berengi and the other towns , and there was no question that their tribal brothers were supplying them with illegal eyestones . In fact , it was the Dorado and the Kia who brought the Sabrehorn to extinction , not Men . And there was no way you were going to close down a poaching operation if the wags would n't testify against their tribal brothers . So I just could n't see any future in the game warden business . I considered buying a farm in the Greenlands up beyond Berengi , but I was used to walking across the land , not digging in it . I even looked into taking on some younger partners in my safari company and spending most of my time in Berengi , but Berengi was just a town , and I did n't like towns . Besides , I had all the money I needed , and I did n't propose to spend the rest of my life working at a job that I did n't like . p 72 In the end , I suppose I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the images of Peponi set in my mind , before I left it for good . And there was never any question about coming back : no one ever goes back to Peponi . Whatever it was that brought you there has got to change before you leave , and once it has changed , you do n't want to see what it 's become . It was n't just the hunters who felt that way ; even Amanda Pickett has n't been back there since Buko Pepon took over ? and he tried like hell to get her back . Even named a district after her , and they 've never done that for any other human . I suppose I ought to make it clear : it was n't Peponi that was dying . It was growing by leaps and bounds , and a steady stream of Men kept immigrating there . What was dying was a way of life that had existed on Peponi . I suppose that the old-timers , the men like Fuentes and Bocci and Hakira and Hellfire Bailey and Catamount Greene and me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Demoncats : we were colorful and we created a lot of interest in the world , but now that civilization was spreading across the face of the planet , we simply were n't necessary anymore . You could never tell when one of us , an old hunter or an old Demoncat , might frighten an investor off . And since we were as wild as the animals , they never could quite trust us to behave the way we were supposed to . We were a potential embarrassment at best , a potential source of disaster at worst ; they were n't exactly sorry to have had us , but they sure were n't sorry to lose us either . People still go to Peponi to see its beauties and its animals , and they still enjoy themselves ; they visit the cities and the game parks , they ski down the mountains and swim in the oceans , they visit the wags in their villages and their cities , and they go home with wonderful stories to tell . But they 'll never set off on a trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and know that they were the first to ever see this particular place . They 'll never know the feeling you p 73 get when you see a herd of Silvercoats so big that it takes them a full day to pass by . They 'll never see a Landship or a Sabrehorn , except in a museum . They wo n't wake up in the morning , hundreds of miles from the nearest town , with the knowledge that they 're free to go anywhere and do anything they please , that a whole world is there for the taking . They 'll smell the air and see the flowers and watch the avians circling overhead , and if they 're lucky they might see a carnivore on a kill , but it wo n't be the same . For one thing , they 'll be on a schedule  --  here in the morning , there at noon , someplace else at dusk  --  while there were times , back in the old days , when I could n't even have told you what month it was . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their flight connections and panic their travel agents ; if I was two or three weeks or months late returning to Berengi after a hunt , anyone who was waiting for me would still be there , drinking in the Thunderhead Bar , or they would have left a note for me on the Message Tree in front of the Equator Hotel . The Peponi I knew did n't have any calendars or clocks or fences , and that Peponi is gone forever . I arrived on Peponi a few years too late , but I left at the right time . Whatever it 's become now , I do n't want to know about it . I brought nothing with me to Peponi ; I took nothing out . I have no regrets . Well , just one : I wish I could have seen it as Oxblood and Fuentes first saw it , when it was truly Paradise . p 77 It had been two years since August Hardwycke 's death . I had completed my paper on Landships , received my degree , briefly joined my father in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and quit . I finally sold a highly-romanticized article on Hardwycke 's career to a popular magazine , and thus encouraged , I wrote two more articles , placed them with lesser-paying but more prestigious markets , and suddenly discovered that I had embarked upon a career as , if not a journalist , at least a biographer of August Hardwycke . It seemed more interesting than importing wood pulp from the Delta Scuti system  --  anything would have been ! ? and I soon obtained a contract to write a book about his life . Since Hardwycke 's death I had reread Amanda Pickett 's /'eponi Days twice , on both occasions marveling at her remarkable felicity of expression and her ability to make even  | the harshest of living conditions seem exotic and beautiful . Somehow the fact that she had seen her father die from overwork , lost her husband in the Kalakala Emergency , and eventually went bankrupt were passed over so briefly that one hardly noticed them . She wrote very selectively of the Peponi she remembered , emphasizing those aspects that she found praiseworthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Hardwycke had put it during one of our conversations , every line of the book was true , but the book itself was one big lie . However , it was not only the most moving evocation of Peponi , but far and away the best-selling one as well ( always excepting Johnny Ramsey 's hunting memoir ) , and I wrote to her a number of times , requesting permission to interview her and read her father 's journals . At first I received polite replies from her that she did n't grant interviews , but when I wrote to tell her that I had finally gotten a contract to write Hardwycke 's biography , she sent me a handwritten note , inviting me to spend a weekend at her home on Barton IV . I immediately accepted , and now , some two months later , I stood before the entrance of her angular chrome and glass home , waiting for her security system to scan my passport . The door slid into a wall a moment later and I found myself staring into the catlike , vertically-slit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more startling by the human maid 's uniform she wore . I was so surprised to see a native of Peponi here on Barton IV that I simply stood and stared at her . " Wo n't you please come in , Mr. Breen ? " she said in heavilyaccented Terran , ignoring my reaction . " My mistress is expecting you . " " Thank you , " I said , recovering my composure . She led me through a circular foyer and down a corridor to a pentagonal study , one wall of which was entirely glass and overlooked a small brook that ran through a wooded yard . A p 79 tall , slender , elegant woman in her mid-sixties arose from a high-backed chair and stepped forward to greet me . " Welcome , Mr. Breen , " she said , extending her hand . " I am Amanda Pickett . I trust you had a pleasant journey ? " " As spaceship trips go , " I said , taking her hand . She was stylishly dressed , her brown hair was exquisitely coiffed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were covered with rings and bracelets which never came from Peponi . All in all , she was hardly the sturdy former farmgirl that I had expected , nor did she seem to wear the mantle of serenity that I was sure the authoress of Peponi Days must possess . " That will be all , Nora , " she said to the Bluegill . " Please get Mr. Breen 's luggage and take it to his room . " Nora nodded , bowed , and left the room . " Does she live here ? " I asked . " She has been my servant for more than forty years , Mr. Breen , " replied Amanda Pickett , " as was her mother before her . If her presence makes you uneasy , I can ? " " It does n't bother me at all , " I assured her . " I was just surprised to see a Peponite here on Barton IV . " I paused awkwardly . " By the way , I want to thank you for agreeing to see me . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " This should be an interesting experience for both of us . " " May I ask why you finally consented to my visit , then ? " She smiled . " First , because I admire your persistence . And second , because I took it upon myself to read two of your articles about August . I realize that you had to slant your pieces for the markets , but I decided that if you are really going to write a book about him that I owed it to him  --  and to Peponi  --  to help you make it as accurate a book as possible . " She paused . " May I offer you a cup of tea ? " She gestured to a sterling silver service that had been set out on a matching tray . p 80 I did n't like tea , but I thought it politic to accept her offer . As she filled my cup , I looked around the room . " I recognize that painting , " I said , indicating a threedimensional portrait . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " It was presented to me by Jonathan Ramsey himself when I won the Sampson Prize . Since then it 's appeared on a number of my dust jackets . " She paused . " The landscapes on each side of it are by a local painter . " " And the holograph ? " I asked , indicating a small holo of a khaki-clad man . " Is that your father ? " " My husband , " she replied . " He died on Peponi . " There was only one bookcase in the room . It was made of a beautiful alien hardwood , and held a bible , her six volumes of fiction , her two-volume biography of Commodore Quincy , a number of other books of varying sizes , and a leather-bound gold-leafed copy of Peponi Days , which was generally considered to be her masterwork . Scattered here and there throughout the room were various literary awards and plaques , but nowhere could I see any mementos of her life on Peponi . " Wo n't you sit down ? " she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked , and she handed me my tea . " Thank you , " I said . " You 're quite welcome , " she replied , seating herself opposite me on a matching chair . There was a momentary silence as she seemed to be studying me . Finally she said , " I read the Landship treatise you sent me , Mr. Breen . " " Matthew , " I corrected her . " What did you think of it ? " " It suffers from a little too much romanticism , but it 's relatively accurate , given the few sources you had to work with . " " You felt I romanticized the Landships ? " I asked , puzzled . " The hunters , " she replied . She looked directly at me . " Have you ever seen a Landship , Matthew ? "  | " Only in holos and museums , " I admitted . " I grew up with them . " " I know , " I said , not quite knowing what to say next . She stared at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself , Matthew . " " Well , there 's really not much to tell . I spent my childhood reading the works of Fuentes and Johnny Ramsey . I majored in exobiology , and when it came time to write my thesis , I chose to write about the extinction of the Landships . I met August Hardwycke in the course of my studies , and decided that he had lived such a fascinating life that I wanted to write a book about him . " I paused uneasily . " Just before he died , he suggested that your father 's journals might make some mention of him , and might even have recorded some exploits that he himself had forgotten . And of course you knew him personally . " " You must understand that I was still a teenager when August Hardwycke left Peponi , " remarked Amanda . " I only met him a few times . " " But you do remember him ? " " Certainly , " she replied . " He was a very dashing , romantic figure . " " Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked , surprised . " You act as though everyone on Peponi went out exploring new lands and hunting wild animals , " she said . " Most of us simply worked for a living . Professional hunters were every bit as exotic to us as they are to you . " " I 'm sorry , " I said with some embarrassment . " I 've read so many accounts of hunting Landships that I tend to forget that it was a relatively rare occupation . " " I 've read most of the literature on Peponi , " she said with some distaste . " It 's a common mistake . Hunting memoirs outnumber everything else by almost two-to-one . " She p 82 paused . " I understand why certain types of Men like to hunt animals . I have never understood why they feel compelled to brag about their conquests in print . " I decided not to mention the fact that she herself had described some of her own safaris in Peponi Days . " Anyway , " I continued , " Hardwycke rarely mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's no reason why he should have given them any thought whatsoever , " she replied . " After all , he 'd disappear into the bush for two or three years at a time , and when he was n't in the bush he was usually in the company of his fellow hunters at the Royal Hotel . " " But he knew you and your father . " " He and my father were among the very first Men on Peponi ; everyone knew everyone else back then . But as more and more humans immigrated there , they tended to stay within their own tightly-knit social groups . " She paused and stared at me . " If you 're to write a biography of August Hardwycke , you really should make an effort to learn about the colonization of Peponi . " " That 's one of the main reasons I 'm here , " I assured her . " It 's one of the main reasons I sent for you , " she replied . " Peponi was a world of great beauty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do n't understand Peponi . " She paused , then continued her brief history lesson . " Even after the Republic officially opened Peponi for colonization , there was no great interest in immigration . It was generally considered to be a dusty , savage little world whose main justification for existence was that ships on the way to Alpha Bismark II could refuel there . " " What about the diamond mines that Ramirez found in the Great Western Desert ? " I interrupted . " They made him rich , but they did n't do much for anyone else , " she answered . " Alpha Bismark II was the world the Republic wanted  --  it had all that platinum and uranium . Pe- poni was just conveniently located . " She paused . " Anyway , I doubt that more than two hundred Men arrived on Peponi during the first two decades , so it was natural that most of them knew each other . " " Hardwycke told me that before he 'd been there thirty years the human population was up to a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a rapid growth after such a slow beginning ? " " Alpha Bismark , " she replied ironically . " I beg your pardon ? " " It got mined out in less than two decades . " She smiled wryly . " So much for the Gem of the Outer Frontier . Suddenly nobody needed a refueling station on Peponi any longer , and the Republic had to find a new way to pay for its presence there , so it began advertising for farmers and homesteaders , practically giving the land away to anyone who would come and work it . " " I see , " I said . She shook her head . " No , I do n't think you do . You 've never been to Peponi , but take my word for it : most of the land  --  everything except the Greenlands , actually  --  is virtually useless for agriculture . " " Did n't word of that get out ? " I asked . " Of course , " she replied . " You ca n't keep something like that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Peponi ? " She smiled . " When you know the answer to that , Matthew , you 'll be well on your way to understanding what made Peponi unique . " She paused . " More tea ? " " No , thank you . " She got to her feet . " You 'll have to excuse me for a few minutes , Matthew , but I have to send a message to my literary agent on Deluros VIII . Also , I was in the midst of replying to some personal correspondence when you arrived . I think , " she added , " that you might be more comfortable in your own p 84 room while I 'm working . " She walked over to the bookcase and pulled out a very large , very old volume . " This should keep you occupied in the meantime , " she said , handing it to me . " What is it ? " I asked . " Sort of a family scrapbook , " she replied . " These are bolos from Peponi . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of them . " She pressed a small button on one of her bracelets , and Nora instantly entered the study . " And now , Mr. Breen ? " " Matthew , " I interrupted . " Matthew , " she amended . " Nora will take you to your room . I 'll send for you when I 'm finished . " " Thank you , " I said , falling into step behind Nora . We walked down a short corridor and came to a single door , which slid back as we approached it . " This is to be your room for the weekend , " announced Nora , in precise but heavily-accented Terran . " I hope that you will find it satisfactory . " " I 'm sure I will , " I said , setting the scrapbook down on one of the two large beds . I noticed that my luggage had been placed on a stand right next to a closet . Nora pointed to another door . " The bathroom , " she said . " Thank you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked . " Not really , " I said . " I would like to ask you a couple of questions , though . " " Yes ? " she said , turning to me . " How long has it been since you left Peponi ? " " Thirty-three years , my gentleman . " " Do n't you miss it ? " " I miss what it was , my gentleman , " she replied . " I do not miss what it has become . " p 85 " What has it become ? " " I 'm sure that my mistress can explain it far better than I can . " " Does the fact that you are still her servant a quarter of a century after Independence ever bother you ? " I asked . " I am not a servant , " she replied with dignity . " I am a maid . " I considered asking her the difference , but I did n't want to appear to be baiting her , so I thanked her for answering my questions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down on the room 's only comfortable chair , and began looking through the album . Some of the earlier holos were badly faded , as if they had n't been sprayed with the proper preservatives ( as indeed they probably had n't ) , but while the colors were poor , I was nonetheless able to make out the subjects quite clearly . Most of the early holos were simply different views of the farm that Amanda Pickett had made famous in Peponi Days ; though I had never seen it , I had no trouble identifying the rambling old farmhouse , the butchery , the schoolhouse Pickett and his daughter had erected for their native squatters . There were a number of shots of his Beefcakes , that hardy hybrid meat animal that had been imported to Peponi , and which the natives , who never fully comprehended the concept of a monied economy , soon began breeding and collecting as their own form of currency . There was only one holograph of Amanda 's mother , a tall , slender , truly lovely woman . Amanda herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baby , a toddler , a little girl , an adolescent , a young woman , and finally as the owner and manager of the farm . Gabriel Pickett looked like any farmer anywhere  --  lean , hard , and overworked . He seemed to age almost from one holograph to the next , and vanished entirely alxout halfway through the book . There were holographs of a number of Gabriel Pickett 's p 86 friends : most were farmers , but I was able to identify a middleaged August Hardwycke in two of them , and I learned for the first time that Fuentes and Johnny Ramsey had stopped there at some point during their historic safari . There was also a very little man with a huge hat that a scribbled caption informed me was the infamous Catamount Greene . Here and there were holographs of Landships drinking from a nearby river , or a Bush Devil that Amanda herself had killed when it tried to kill one of the Beefcakes . . . but most of the animals in the holos were pets : a baby Silvercoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At one point the farm must have resembled a cross between a children 's zoo and an animal orphanage . Some of the most interesting holos , however , were those of the Peponites ( which , thanks to my association with Hardwycke , I still thought of as Bluegills ) . There were shots of the household staff , the kitchen staff , the gardeners , and the farm laborers , all clad in immaculate white outfits . They may have worked virtually for free , but there were still an enormous number of mouths to feed . And then I came to the end of the book , and there were no animals , no natives , not even Amanda . There was just her husband , weapons strapped to his waist and slung over his shoulder , looking grim and hard , and I decided that these must have been taken during the Emergency . Then , on a whim , I went back to the middle of the book and started looking at the young Bluegill faces , trying to see if I could spot Buko Pepon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortably , was that one youthful native face looked very much like another to me . If he was there , I could n't recognize him . In fact , I could n't even spot Nora , and I had seen her just twenty minutes ago . I studied the faces further , wondering : What does one look for in a child who will grow up to be the Moses and Messiah of his people , a leader whom the Republic will first equate PARADISE : A CHRONICLE OF A DISTANT WORLD 87 with Satan Incarnate and then revere as perhaps the greatest alien statesman of his time ? A steely glint of eye , a hardened jaw , a face reflecting an inner compassion ? He could have been any of those ill-clad native youngsters or none of them ; there was simply no way to tell . I was still staring at the book , thumbing through its pages , when Nora entered the room and announced that Amanda Pickett was ready to receive me once again . I tucked the book under my arm , followed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . " Did you find it interesting ? " she asked , taking the scrapbook back from me . " Fascinating , " I replied . " Is there a bolo of Buko Pepon in here ? " She shook her head . " No , he was raised about three miles away . " You knew him , though ? " " I met him occasionally when I was growing up , and we attended college together on Deluros VIII . I believe he was the first of his race ever to attend an off-world school . " She paused . " He was Robert Prekina back in those days . I do n't think he actually changed his name until after he graduated from college . " " What was he like ? " " He was a very unusual little wag , and he grew up to be a very unusual big wag . " She stopped suddenly . " I hope my use of the term wag does n't offend you . It 's a word I grew up with , and it never had any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I replied . " I 'm still trying to stop thinking of them as Bluegills . I suppose it 's Hardwycke 's influence . " " Please do n't use that word in front of Nora , " she said seriously . " That 's a term they might have killed you for , even before Independence . " " So I gathered , " I said . " By the way , I noticed only one p 88 holograph of your mother , and you made no mention of her in your book . When did she die ? " " About thirty years after the holograph was taken . " I must have looked puzzled , for she continued : " My mother ran away with another man when I was three years old . " " A colonist ? " I asked . " Colonists were the only men she ever met . " She paused . " There was a pretty wild crowd that lived about an hour to the north of Berengi . They hunted and they partied , and they vied with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptions , they were actually subsistence farmers , producing no more than they and their squatters could consume . It was a very attractive life for a woman who always had to work and never knew any luxury . " She fell silent , and I decided that it was time to change the subject . " I see from your album that Johnny Ramsey visited your farm , " I noted . " Johnny Ramsey was first , last , and always a politician , even when there were no offices left to run for . He stopped at every farm he could find , just to shake hands and pass the time of day . I was only four years old at the time , and I truly do n't recall his visit . " Suddenly she smiled . " My father used to say that he could have made an excellent living just printing up Jonathan Ramsey Slept Here ' plaques . " " He must have been one of the most colorful characters ever to set foot on Peponi , " I said . " They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Personally , my vote would go to Catamount Greene . " " Not Hardwycke ? " She shook her head . " He spent all his time in the bush . Catamount was always in the thick of things . He made eight or nine fortunes on Peponi , and lost every one of them . " She paused . " You knew , of course , that at one time he was the King of the Bogoda ? " p 89 " I 've heard about it . " " It 's a sore point with them nowadays , and they 've written it out of their history books , but it 's the truth , " she said . " The Bogoda were always the major tribe on the Great Eastern Continent , just as they are today . . . but when humans started arriving on Peponi , they refused to have anything to do with us . They would n't trade with us , would n't work for us , would n't even let us pass through their territory . Catamount walked into Bogodaland literally on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had no interpreter with him . " She smiled . " Two years later he was their king . " " How did he manage it ? " I asked . " That depends on whose story you believe . According to him , he found two warring villages , offered his services  --  and his molecular imploder  --  to the smaller one , won the battle for them , and proceeded methodically through Bogodaland , ending wars and consolidating territory . " She paused . " My own guess is that it was much less romantic than that . A number of the Bogoda were suffering from various minor diseases , and I believe he simply imported enough medication to cure them . By the time I met him , the Bogoda revered him more as a witch doctor than a conqueror . " She sighed . " But however he did it , there 's no question that he became their king . " In fact , " she continued , " at one point the government ordered his arrest for making treaties with the Bogoda without their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bogodaland to take him back to Berengi , and when they got there they came face to face with 50,000 armed Bogoda warriors . Naturally , they were n't anxious to try to take him anywhere  --  but then he decided to give himself up , so he walked all the way to Berengi with a few hundred bodyguards , marched them into the courtroom , and demanded an immediate trial . The judge took one look at his retainers and threw the case out of court . " p 90 " How did you meet him ? " I asked . " Our farm was in Bogodaland , " she replied . " You could n't live there for any length of time without meeting Catamount Greene . " " I never saw Bogodaland listed on any map . " " We did n't call it that , but the wags did . " " What did you call it ? " " Oh , there were numerous names for all the tiny towns that sprung up , but the entire area , except for a couple of national parks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Greenlands ? That 's supposed to be the breadbasket of Peponi , so to speak . " She nodded . " The Greenlands encompass almost all of the truly rich farmland on the continent  --  which , I might add , is n't much . After the colonists found out how poor the rest of the land was , they petitioned the government to restrict the Greenlands for human use only , and the government agreed . " " And Catamount Greene arranged that ? " I asked . " No , Catamount was just an adventurer and a scalawag , " she answered . " A charming one , to be sure  --  but he had no more interest in the problems of the farmers than he had in anything else that did n't line his pockets with money . " She paused . " No , the man responsible for getting the government to give us the highlands was Commodore Albert Mason Quincy . " " I read your biography of him , " I said . " It was the first book you ever wrote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'd love to see the statue of him that they erected in Berengi , " I continued . " The holographs of it were very impressive . " " They tore it down the day after Independence , " she replied with an expression of nostalgia tempered by bitterness . " It used to stand at the north end of Commodore Quincy p 91 Avenue , which was once Main Street and has since become Buko Pepon Boulevard . " " I was n't aware of that . " She nodded . " He 'd been dead for twenty years , but he was still a symbol of everything they hated . " " Did you know him well ? " I asked . " I did n't know him at all , " she answered . " I knew of him , of course ; every colonist did . He was , in a very real sense , our guardian angel . But I did n't receive the commission to write his biography until after he had died . " She paused . " Would you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Very much so , " I assured her . " There 's a group of about thirty Peponi expatriates on Barton IV , " she replied . " I 've taken the liberty of inviting a few of them over to dinner this evening . " " Thank you , " I said . " I very much appreciate it . " I paused . " Is there some reason why there are so many of you here on Barton IV ? " " We tend to be a little clannish , " she answered . " And we have a shared experience that no one else can truly cornprehend . " " Living on Peponi ? " " No , " she corrected me . " Surviving on Peponi. " p 92 The Peponi expatriates that Amanda Pickett invited to her home were a mixed lot . There was Wilkes  --  I never learned his first name  --  a lean , bronze-skinned man who looked more like a hunter than a farmer . He wore a bracelet of braided hair from the tail of a Landship , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet it was the bracelet , rather than the outfit , that seemed proper . He had lost his right arm in the Kalakala Emergency , and I had a feeling that his left eye , too , was artificial , though I never asked him . I suppose he would have made an excellent and loyal friend , but my initial impression was that I certainly would n't want to have him for an enemy . There was Malcolm Pepper , a neat little man with the affected dress of a dandy , who looked like he had never been within fifty light years of Peponi . He wore more jewelry than 92 pI 93 Amanda , every hair was exactly in place , his face had been treated so that he no longer grew hair on it , and I was able to detect slight traces of mascara and rouge . His shoes may not have been the brightest things he owned , but they came close . I had a difficult time picturing him facing a Demoncat or even an unplowed field , but he looked like he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club in Berengi . There was Jessamine Gaines , a pudgy , gray-haired woman , as tanned as Wilkes , who had buried four husbands in Peponi 's unfertile soil : one had been killed by a Bush Devil , one by a Thunderhead , and two by disease . She wore no jewelry except for a rather garish red eyestone on which had been engraved the tiny likeness of the Landship from which it had been taken . Finally , there were the Crawfords , an octogenarian couple , both small and very wrinkled , evidence of their years spent working in the Peponi sun . Neither of them spoke much , she from choice , he because he was very sensitive about the lisp made by his prosthetic tongue  --  his real one had been cut out during the Kalakala Emergency . They all arrived within a couple of minutes of each other , and by the time introductions had been made , Amanda escorted us into her living room , where we all seated ourselves while Nora brought us drinks . " So , my dear boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into a long gold holder , " Amanda tells me that you 're writing a book about August Hardwycke ? " " That 's right , " I replied . " He was before my time , " continued Pepper . " A most brutal man , or so I 've been given to understand . " " I did n't find him so , " I said . " How else may one describe a man who dedicates himself to a career of butchery ? " said Pepper pompously . Then he shrugged . " Be that as it may , he left Peponi before most of pI 94 us had arrived . I fear that we 're not going to be of much use to you . " " I 'm not so sure of that , " I replied . " You 've all lived on Peponi . I 'm always interested in the reasons why five people should walk out of paradise . " Wilkes snorted contemptuously . " Paradise ? Whatever gave you that notion ? " " That 's what the word Peponi means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was paradise , " acknowledged Wilkes after a moment 's thought , " back when Landships and Sabrehorns roamed the planet and men like Hardwycke were free to wander and hunt where they wanted . " He paused , frowning . " But that was a long time ago , Mr. Breen , and a lot has happened since then . " " Commodore Quincy tried to make it a paradise , " added Jessamine Gaines , " but the Republic fought him every step of the way . " " It was n't just the Republic , " said Wilkes . " It was those damned bloody wags ! " I turned to Nora , who had reentered the room and was walking from one guest to another , serving drinks , but if she heard what was said she gave no indication of it . They seemed happy to ignore her existence , and she , for her part , seemed quite content to be ignored . I wondered if all Peponites had been treated like this in what everyone fondly referred to as the " old days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it ceased resembling paradise a long time ago . Still , I have hopes for it . " " Then why did you leave ? " said Wilkes gruffly . She shrugged . " It was time . Everything was changing . I left the day they buried Catamount Greene . He seemed to represent the old Peponi , and when he died it was as if the last vestige of the Peponi I knew had died with him . " " He was from the old Peponi , no question about it , " agreed p 95 Amanda . " And he was the one human they left totally alone during the Emergency . " " They were scared to death of him , " said Wilkes . " No , " said Jessamine . " I think they worshipped him . " " Same thing , " said Wilkes . " Maybe I 'm writing about the wrong man , " I said , carefully setting my drink down on a silver coaster . " The more I hear about this Catamount Greene , the more I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One more barbarian for the semi-literates to worship , " said Pepper distastefully . " Are n't you being a little harsh on him ? " I said . " My dear boy , he actually lived with the Bogoda for three years ! " replied Pepper . He leaned back on his cushioned chair , fingers interlaced , as if there was obviously nothing further to say on the subject . " There 's only one man worth writing about , " said Wilkes , " and that 's Commodore Quincy . The worth of a man is n't how many amusing stories you can tell about him , but what kind of mark he leaves behind him . If Hardwycke and Greene and Fuentes and the rest of them had never lived , it would n't have made a bit of difference . If Quincy had n't been the man he was and gone to Peponi when he did , the planet 's entire history would have taken a different course . " " True enough , " said Crawford . They were the first words he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The stupid son of a bitch ! " " That 's your injury speaking , not you , " said Jessamine . " My husband would be a whole man if it were n't for Quincy and his policies , " said Mrs. Crawford heatedly . " We 've all been through this a hundred times , " said Wilkes , leaning forward intently . " You did n't object to those policies when they were benefiting you . None of us did . " He paused . " Your husband lost a tongue ; I lost an arm . Others lost a lot p 96 more than either of us . It 's part of the price we paid to tame a world . And if the Republic had had the guts to back us up , it would have been worth the price . " " Rubbish , " said Pepper , paying no attention to Nora as she reentered the room and filled his glass again . " If the wags wanted that silly old dirtball that badly , I 'm perfectly willing to let them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life has n't changed in the least since you left , " replied Jessamine . " But most of us loved Peponi . We gave everything we had to it . " " I 've heard all this before , my dear , " said Pepper with a bored expression . " It usually precedes a three-hour deification of Commodore Quincy . " " The man was a saint , " said Jessamine firmly . " An absolute saint . " " The dear old boy used to tear up the Royal Hotel every time he went on a binge , " noted Pepper . " I 'd hardly call that saintly behavior . " " But he always paid for it , " said Jessamine . " He also shot a couple of wags who had the temerity to enter the Thunderhead Bar while he was there , " interjected Amanda disapprovingly . " What 's wrong with that ? " demanded Wilkes . " He paid his fine , did n't he ? " " I can see where the wags might have objected anyway , " I offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Wilkes , turning to me . " You ca n't possibly know what things were like back then , Mr. Breen . We were colonists on a distant world , outnumbered by tens of thousands to one . We had to establish certain rules or we would have been overrun . " " We were anyway , " said Crawford . There was an uneasy pause . " Only after the rules were suspended , " said Jessamine at last , shifting uncomfortably on her chair . " If Commodore PARADISE : A CHRONICLE OF A DISTANT WORLD 97 Quincy had lived , there never would have been an Emergency . " Or if there had been , he would have put it down in less than a week , " said Wilkes decisively . Amanda shook her head . " He 'd have been the first one they killed . " " Right , " agreed Crawford . " The Siboni would have protected him , " said Wilkes . " He was always doing favors for them . " " There were ten million Bogoda and only half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could they have done ? " " They could have fought ! " said Wilkes . " One Siboni is worth twenty Bogoda ! " " They would n't have had the slightest idea what they were fighting for , " said Pepper , downing his second drink in a single swallow . " Most of them still live in their charming grass huts and hunt for dinner with spears and arrows . " " He 's quite correct , you know , " said Amanda to Wilkes . " The Bogoda run the planet . I do n't think any Siboni has ever run for office , or served the government in any capacity . " ' That 's because they 're warriors , " said Wilkes stubbornly . " Quincy knew that . That 's why he went out of his way to befriend them . If he had been alive during the Emergency , he 'd have turned them loose on the Bogoda and we 'd all still he on Peponi . " Amanda shook her head again . " The old days were coming to an end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All those immigrants , all those tourists  --  it just was n't the same . Berengi changed so much from one month to the next that you almost did n't recognize it . " Jessamine stared directly at Crawford . " And you ca n't blame Quincy for that . " Nora entered the room and walked up to Amanda , who arose a moment later and announced that dinner was ready . We walked into the large , elegantly-appointed dining room , p 98 and I found myself sitting between Wilkes and Jessamine Gaines , facing the Crawfords . Amanda and Pepper sat at opposite ends , and Pepper immediately busied himself selecting the wine for the table . " Have you an opinion about Commodore Quincy ? " Jessamine asked me when we were all seated . " I only know what I 've read in Amanda 's biography of him , " I said cautiously . " I know he managed to get the Republic to decree that only humans could farm the Greenlands , I know he was the political leader of the colonists , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know that he died without a credit to his name . " " It was because of his efforts that most of us did n't share his financial destiny , " said Jessamine . " You mean because the Greenlands were so fertile ? " She shook her head . " When the Commodore arrived , there were only two or three farmers on the whole planet . I believe that he even predated your friend Hardwycke . " " By about five years , " confirmed Amanda . " He was an incredibly wealthy man , " continued Jessamine , " and he was totally committed to Peponi . He grew corn and wheat and it died . He imported cattle and sheep from Earth and they died . He planted soybeans and they died . " " Why ? " I asked . " Because Peponi is n't Earth , or any other planet . It 's Peponi , with its own soil , its own parasites , its own diseases . Crop after crop kept failing , breed after breed of animal kept dying , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he imported Beefcakes , and began growing mutated tea and sugar berries , and when they thrived everyone else followed suit  --  but by then he was already so deeply in debt that he could n't pull himself out . " " More than that , though , " added Pepper , as Nora brought the salad to the table , " he was our cultural as well as our political leader . That much I 'll grant the old boy . He could p 99 afford to import the latest Deluros fashions , and pretty soon everyone else would follow suit . He would recommend a book , and everyone would read it . And in his dealings with the government , he was the exact opposite of your newfound hero Catamount Greene . " " I got the distinct impression from Amanda 's book that he held the colonial government in contempt , " I noted . " Since Hardwycke led me to believe that Greene and the rest of his contemporaries shared that view , does n't that imply a certain similarity ? " " Only in philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allow me to give you two examples to show you how they handled similar problems . Who knows ? Perhaps you can find some way to use it in your book  --  in which case I shall expect to see my name in a footnote . " " If I can use it , I 'll be happy to give you the credit , " I replied . " One day , about fifty years ago , some soldiers were bringing a herd of Beefcakes through the northern desert into Berengi , to feed the garrison that was stationed there . They came down with some fever or other , and it seemed likely that the Beefcakes would die of thirst before the soldiers were healthy enough to continue their march . Your friend Greene had been poaching Landships in the area , and chanced across them . They offered him fifty credits per head to deliver the herd , and he accepted  --  but when he arrived in Berengi and presented his bill , the governor decided that his men had made a poor bargain under duress , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a head . " Greene was in his usual foul mood when he left the governor , and he wandered over to the bar at the Equator Hotel . " I le paused for a moment as Nora began collecting the salad dishes and carrying them off to the kitchen . " Now , it just so happened that some of the local farmers were holding a meeting at the Equator bar that evening to protest the Republic 's p 100 agricultural policies  --  and in less than five minutes Greene had them up in arms and ready to march on the governor 's mansion . He led them through the streets , and when they reached their destination he told them to wait outside while he presented their list of grievances to the governor . " He left them lined up at the gate , walked into the governor 's office , took the dear man over to the window , pointed at the huge group of enraged farmers , and explained that they were there to protest the government 's breaking its promise to pay him fifty credits a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a potential riot on his hands , and paid Greene the rest of the money . Then Greene went back to the farmers , assured them that the governor was looking into their grievances , and suggested that they all go home before they did something they might regret . " He paused and then grinned . " The next morning he 'd bought a new landcar and was back poaching Landships and Sabrehorns . " I laughed appreciatively , amid polite smiles from the rest of the listeners , who were obviously well-acquainted with the tale . " Now , to contrast that , " continued Pepper , as Nora brought out the main course , a local gamefish in a wine sauce , " let 's examine how dear old Commodore Perry approached the problem of a hostile colonial administration . " He paused to insert a new cigarette in his holder . " When the Republic went to war against the Staghhi , the miners and shipbuilders in the Spica system found themselves short of food , since the war affected the normal transport routes . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beleaguered soul who had had dealings with Greene  --  to ship all of our exports to Spica II and Spica VI at something less than competitive prices . Do you know what Quincy did when his appeals to the governor failed ? " " No , " I lied , for I had of course read Amanda 's account of the incident . Still , if her biography of Quincy was as inaccurate PARADISE : A CHRONICLE OF A DISTANT WORLD 101 Peponi Days , it certainly could n't hurt to hear a firsthand description . " Well , to begin with , this pillar of civic virtue burned down the governor 's mansion . " " That got their attention , " put in Wilkes between mouthfuls . " Then , since he , perhaps more than anyone else , realized that for the first and probably last time in its history , the Republic actually needed Peponi , he led a march on the spaceport , shut it down , and presented the Republic with a list of demands . He refused to reopen it until they agreed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to promise that there would be no reprisals after the Staghhi war , and the Republic had to pledge , in writing , that they would never recant their decree that the Greenlands were reserved solely for human use . " He paused . " That 's the difference between men like Greene and a man like Quincy . Greene was a scoundrel and a scalawag who could lie and bluff his way out of almost anything , whereas Quincy never bluffed . He was fully prepared to let the entire planet go bankrupt if the Republic had n't given in to his demands . " He turned to me expectantly , as if I were supposed to make some comment . " And did the Republic keep its word about not punishing him after the war ? " I asked as a matter of form , for again , I had read the answer in Amanda 's book . " Absolutely ! In fact , the dear man became so popular that they actually offered to make him the Governor of Peponi ! " laughed Pepper . " He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd all still be there . " " If it had n't been for Buko Pepon , he 'd still be revered as the most important figure in Peponi 's history , " added Jessamine . " I disagree , " interjected Amanda , with the air of one who had explained her position time and again . " If it had n't p 102 been for Quincy , there would have been no Buko Pepon . There would have been a subsistence farmer named Robert Prekina . " " Did they ever meet ? " I asked , finally remembering to take a bite of my dinner , and deciding that I did n't like the local fish very much . " Not socially , that 's a certainty ! " said Pepper , looking vastly amused . " Quincy had no use for any wags except his Siboni pets . But I imagine Pepon must have seen or heard him speak from time to time . " " Probably not , " said Amanda . " Pepon was still a child when Quincy died . " " Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , " said Jessamine with a sigh . There was a momentary pause , which was finally broken by Wilkes . " We should have blown the little wag bastard away the first time he stepped out of line , " he said . Crawford nodded his agreement . " There 's no sense being kind to them ; they simply do n't understand it . I tried it , and look where it got me . " " If Quincy had known what Buko Pepon would become , " continued Wilkes , " he 'd have killed him at birth . " " Then there would just have been someone else , " said Jessamine . " Pepon was better than some of them would have been . At least we 're all still here . " " Here , " repeated Wilkes angrily . " Not there ! " " That 's not entirely fair , " put in Amanda . " He invited everyone to stay . " " I was there for the death of everything we loved , " lisped Crawford , forcing the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wake and the funeral , too . " " Generosity , " muttered Wilkes . " That was our first mistake . Give them a little education , pay them a little money , and suddenly they forgot everything we did for them . " PARADISE : A CHRONICLE OF A DISTANT WORLD 103 " It was their world , " I said . " It was a goddamned jungle ! " snapped Wilkes . " Who do you think built the towns and roads  --  the wags ? We sweated blood to tame that planet ! A lot of good men died in the process , but we got the job done , the way Men always get the job done . In the process , we showed them how to fight disease , how to make their land productive , gave them all the benefits of a Republic colony  --  and look at how they repaid us . " He paused for breath . " Hell , if it was n't for us , they 'd still be sitting around naked in the dirt ! " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't hate the wags . We never did . " Wilkes snorted contemptuously , and she glared at him before turning back to me . " They 've rewritten their history books to make it look as if we had enslaved them , but it just is n't true . They benefited from almost everything we did . . . but you ca n't expect to civilize an entire world of savages in one or two generations . Did you know , " she added , " that when Men first arrived on Peponi , there was no word in any of their dialects for wheel ' ? They 'd never seen one ! Surely no reasonable man could expect us to hand over a planet to a people who had no written language , who consulted witch doctors and magicians , who worshipped fifteen or twenty gods and tortured domestic animals as a religious ritual . Even Commodore Quincy realized that someday they would have to control their own destiny . . . but he knew that it would be many generations before they were ready to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pointed out . " They 're doing it right now . " " Are they ? " she shot back . " They owe the Republic billions of credits that they 'll never be able to repay , they 've overgrazed most of their grasslands , and their standard of living is lower now than before Independence . " She paused . " Quincy knew that they 'd behave exactly like this if they were given their independence too soon . That 's why he kept them out p 104 of the Greenlands ; he foresaw that they 'd turn it into a desert if they were n't educated in modern farming technology . You know , there was a time , and not so long ago , when the Greenlands produced enough to feed the entire planet . Now they import more than half their food . " " They make Quincy out to be a demon now , " said Wilkes . " They even had a public celebration the day they tore down his statue . But if it had n't been for him , there would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statue in the first place . " There was another uneasy pause , as they waited to see if the outsider was going to make any further misstatements about the past . " I 'm very interested in something Amanda said a few moments ago , " I said after a moment , when it became obvious that no one else was going to break the silence . " What was that ? " " That Buko Pepon asked all the humans to remain on Peponi after independence . " " He did more than ask , " said Wilkes contemptuously . " He practically begged . " " How many Men took him up on his offer ? " " There were about a million of us on the planet , " said Amanda . " I would guess a third of us stayed . " " How have they fared ? " " You 'd have to ask them , would n't you ? " said Wilkes . " There 've been no anti-human pogroms or anything like that ? " I continued . Pepper laughed . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million ships , and a standing army that numbers in the billions . Surely you do n't think they 'd stand still for a massacre , do you ? " " They stood still for Independence , " I answered . " That was a totally different matter , " said Wilkes . " I do n't mean to insult you , Mr. Breen , but you 're speaking from ignorance . p 105 " No offense taken , " I said . " If I did n't want to cure my ignorance , I would n't be asking questions . " ? " Oh , very well said ! " chuckled Pepper . " Let 's see you reply to that , Wilkes . " " From everything I hear , most of the Men who stayed behind are doing quite well , " said Jessamine , getting back to my original question . " In fact , I 've frequently toyed with the notion of moving back there myself . " " May I ask you a personal question ? " I said . " Yes , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a quarter century . If you miss Peponi , why have n't you gone back ? " " Because the Peponi I miss no longer exists , " she answered . " Then why consider going back at all ? " I persisted . " Because that 's where I was happiest , " she replied thoughtfully . " Have n't you asked yourself why such totally different people should spend so much time together , Mr. Breen ? " " The question had crossed my mind , " I said . " It 's because we 've shared experiences that no one here on Barton IV , or anywhere else in the Republic , can appreciate . Even Malcolm , who can afford to live anywhere he wants , who never worked the land a day in his life and would run for cover if a Silvercoat approached him , has more in common with us than with anyone else on this world . " " True enough , " admitted Pepper . " You ca n't know what it was like , Mr. Breen  --  and if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a certain beauty to it back then , a certain feeling that each day promised a remarkable new experience . " " You would wake up every morning to clean fresh air , " continued Jessamine . " You did nothing for yourself ; you had servants for everything . The countryside was beautiful , rolling green land crisscrossed by rivers and dotted with animals . It could be a hard life when the rains did n't come , or the Landships ruined some of your crops , but somehow you knew that p 106 if God had ever made a planet for Himself , it was Peponi . " She paused . " It seemed eternal and changeless , and even though we could see change coming on the horizon we had men like Commodore Quincy to push it back to where we did n't have to think about it . Even the Emergency seemed to reaffirm our feelings for Peponi , for now it was no longer a gift , but a homeland for which we had fought the bloodiest of battles . " " And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We fought and we won , and the damned Republic gave it away . " " It was n't that simple , and you know it , " said Amanda . " It was exactly that simple , " reiterated Wilkes . " I 'm not going to argue with you again , " said Amanda . " I know your feelings about it , and you know mine . " Wilkes glared at her for a moment , but let the subject drop . During the meal I heard a lot more about Commodore Quincy , and not very much about August Hardwycke , who did n't seem to interest them as much , since he had had no effect on their lives . Then , as Nora began removing the dessert plates , we adjourned to the living room for a mint-flavored liqueur that had been imported from Peponi , and which everyone else seemed to relish although it was much too sweet for me . Finally Nora saw that I was n't drinking , and brought me a cup of strong Peponi tea . As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to leave , and offered Jessamine Gaines a ride home . She accepted , and a few minutes later Wilkes followed them . Then Mrs. Crawford went off with Amanda to see some new purchase in her study , and I was left alone with Crawford . " Did you get your answers ? " he asked with a pronounced lisp . " Not really , " I said . " But I have a lot more questions now . " " Peponi 's like that . " p 107 " You have no desire to return there ? " He shook his head . " If you found the perfect woman , had an affair with her , and then had to leave , would you really want to see her thirty years later when she was old and fat and toothless and avaricious , or would you like to remember her as she was ? " " I do n't know , " I said . " If I truly loved her , I think I 'd want to see her again . " He shrugged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengthy pause . " It must have been wonderful to wake up to the sight of Landships in the distance , " I said , breaking the silence . " I woke up to many things , " he lisped . " Landships , Bush Devils , flocks of avians so thick you could barely see the sky , droughts , monsoons , even the Kalakala . " " I 'd love to hear about your life on Peponi , " I said . He checked his timepiece , then shrugged again . " Why not ? " he replied . p 198 We were n't among the earliest arrivals on Peponi ( said Crawford ) , not like Hardwycke and Greene and Quincy . But we got there while it was still a wilderness , when a man had to fight the soil and the animals and the elements to make a living . I 'd been an officer in the Navy for eight years , and when I met and married Christina it seemed to me that it was time to retire and settle down . The Republic was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war against the Canphor Twins , so we decided to move there . There were times during the first few years when we were ready to call it quits and admit we 'd made a terrible mistake . The drought killed our first crop . Landships trampled our second . Our third crop came in  --  barely  --  and then floods washed our fourth away . You would n't think you could have drought and floods within three years of each other . p 109 Bush Devils and Demoncats and Nightkillers picked off i'II most of , our meat animals the first couple of years , until I stopped using wire fences and began using thornbush enclosures like the Bogoda did . Looking back now , I do n't know why we stuck it out  --  except that you 'd wake up every morn-ing and look out over the Bzenzi Hills and know you 'd never find a more beautiful place no matter how many worlds you visited . We had four children  --  three sons and a daughter  --  and raised them all to maturity , which is a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd outlive them all , but I did , which says more about Peponi than it does about me . Daniel , our firstborn , was the adventurous one . He had a p pet Treecrawler that used to ride everywhere on his shoulder . One day a Bush Devil killed it . Daniel never cried , never said a word . . . but that night he was nowhere to be found , and I noticed that one of my sonic rifles was missing . Then , the next morning , just before we could launch a full-scale search for him , he came back dragging the Bush Devil behind him ... and from that day on , he was the hunter in the family . Nothing could make that boy stay at his computer or do his lessons , but he knew the bush better than most professional hunters , and we never lacked for meat again . To the day he died he was barely literate , but literacy is n't exactly a survival trait on a world like Peponi . And when the drought would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Daniel would disappear for a month or two , and when he came back he had enough eyestones to hold the banks at bay until the next harvest . l ' ! I Thomas was the son every father dreams of having : bright , handsome , hard-working . He always had his chores done , and spent most of his time locked away with his books and his computer , learning things for the sheer joy of learning . I always thought he 'd have turned out to be a writer like you if he 'd lived . He was a quiet boy , never caused anyone any p 110 trouble , got along well with everyone . I was thrilled when he married the girl from the next farm ; I even expanded our house and gave him the new wing as a wedding present . Caleb was our little savage . He was more Bogodan than the Bogoda . I 'd yell at him until I was hoarse about keeping his distance from the wags , and five minutes later he 'd be back by the squatters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all their crazy stories and legends . He even took to wearing a Demoncat 's tooth hung around his neck to ward off evil spirits , and the more Christina and I would try to convince him that Men did n't mingle with wags , the more of a wag he became . I threw him out of the house the day he came home from the hospital , his skin all burnt from the brands they applied to him during one of their Rite of Passage ceremonies  --  he could n't have been sixteen at the time  --  but we made our peace and he moved back in a couple of years later . Well , not exactly in ; but he lived on the land , in his own grass hut . If Men and wags could interbreed , I would n't have put it past him to have taken a wag wife . Jessica was always my favorite , and I spoiled her as much as one could spoil a child on Peponi . Probably I gave her too much . I remember when she was twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that was probably a mistake ; here was a girl who had never seen a three-story building , and suddenly she was on the capital world of the race of Man , rubbing shoulders with  --  what was the population back then ? ? eleven billion people , and surrounded by all those interlinked skyscrapers that almost blotted out the sun . I thought most kids would want to see more of the galaxy after being exposed to something like that  --  and maybe they would  --  but when she came home she threw herself into every aspect of the farm , and when it became obvious that Thomas would eventually be leaving Peponi to attend a first-class university and Daniel and Caleb had absolutely no interest in p 111 the farm , she begged us to let her manage the place . I do n't think she ever willingly set foot off of it again . She did n't even like to go into Berengi to shop , and begged off making the trip whenever she could get away with it . After we 'd been there six or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For one thing , we had good rains five years in a row , and by the time we hit another drought , Commodore Quincy had already developed a strain of mutated sugar berries that could thrive without water , so all we lost was our tea crop . We had Beefcakes by then , though they took an inordinate amount of work . They were n't native to the planet , and they tended to pick up almost every type of external parasite there was . We had to dip them three and four times a week to keep them healthy , and they tended to attract all kinds of predators . Still , we finally started pulling ourselves out of debt , and we found that we loved the life we were now living . The three youngest children had so many pets  --  mostly orphaned animals  --  that I sometimes thought we were running a zoo , or maybe an animal infirmary , and there were times we almost had to forcibly restrain Daniel from appropriating some of them for the dinner table . Our social life centered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Commodore Quincy 's estate on the eastern edge of the Greenlands . Every other Saturday there was a function of some kind  --  a pet show , a flower show , a concert , a dance  --  and we 'd take the landcar there for the weekend and return home totally refreshed and ready to face the problem of coaxing a living from the land for another fortnight . Twice a year , during the rainy seasons , we 'd go into Berengi and spend a week shopping ; in the beginning we 'd stay at the Royal or the Equator hotels , but when they became overrun with tourists , we joined a private club where we could spend time with our friends . The Dalliance Club is the one p 112 that got all the notoriety , but there were half a dozen more respectable clubs , and most of the locals belonged to one or more of them . When we arrived , our land  --  it came to about two square miles  --  was totally empty , but within a day or two the company that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and then called us into their office to select a headman . I was n't even aware that we needed one , but they assured me that no Man worked his own land . The wages for a headman were something like two credits a week  --  a mixed drink cost you almost that much in the Thunderhead Bar  --  but they told me that it was a fair wage , and certainly no Bogoda ever complained to me about money . We picked a tall , good-looking wag named Bill , and within a week he had brought some fifty or sixty of his relatives to the farm . They spent two days constructing their huts , and then went to work , plowing the fields and planting the seeds . It seemed to me that a tractor could do the job much faster and more efficiently , but it was explained to me by one of my neighbors that it was financially prohibitive to import farm machinery that far out on the Rim , and that even if the machinery were available , we 'd be putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that it made that much difference , since none of them had been working before we arrived , but they pointed out that the only way the Bogoda could have access to fertile land was if we allowed our squatters to plant kitchen gardens around their huts , and finally we decided that we might as well conform to the established practice , since we could n't afford the tractors and harvesters anyway . After we 'd been there for about two years Christina set up a small infirmary , since the Bogoda seemed to be completely ignorant of all modern medical procedures , and they kept multiplying so rapidly that a year or two later we built a small schoolhouse on the grounds . We were n't qualified to give them a real education , but we did manage to teach most of PARADISE : A CHRONICLE OF A DISTANT WORLD 113 them Terran , which made our lives a little easier , and we taught them the rudiments of contour farming and crop rotation . And by the time Caleb was five or six years old he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any communication problems after that . Our Bogoda were a pretty decent lot , and we were really quite fond of most of them . We 'd seen what happened to farms where the wags were treated badly , and we made up our minds that that would never happen to us . We had to punish them if we found them loafing or stealing , but we never flogged them , and the only wags who ever died on my property died from old age or disease or a millipede bite , never from a bullet or a whipping . ( I think Caleb would have led an insurrection if we 'd ever raised a hand against them . ) We were good to our Bogoda , and they were good to us . When they 'd become so sick , or get so chewed up by an animal , that we could n't cure them ourselves , we 'd send them off to the wag hospital that the government had set up just outside Berengi , and we always took them back when they were healed . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got them jobs in the kitchen at the Equator Hotel , and I saw to it that they got six credits a week apiece , since it was more expensive for a wag to live in town . The only major fight I remember having was when Caleb fell out of a tree he had climbed and broke his arm , and Bill , our headman , wanted to take him to the local witch doctor to get it fixed . I explained that we had to go to Berengi to get the arm set by a doctor , Caleb sided with Bill , and for a few minutes there I thought I was actually going to have to thrash the pair of them ; but finally Bill gave in , and Caleb was in so much pain that after a while he did n't care who fixed his arm as long as it got fixed . The minute we got back from Berengi , though , Bill took Caleb to his tribal magician for some herbs and blessings , just in case the pressure cast did n't work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , when the wags saw that our medicine cured them better than their own witch doctors could , they started converting to Christianity . They did n't understand much about it , but they knew our God was stronger than theirs  --  or at least that He was a better healer . I never could get used to all those shaggy alien shapes sitting in pews and grunting out hymns , but if it meant that we could keep them alive and healthy and working , I was willing to tolerate it . Things went pretty smoothly even after the Commodore died . A lot of people had predicted that the Republic 's alienloving liberals would move in and start putting the wags in charge of various governmental departments , but we were too far out on the Rim for the Republic to notice . Besides , they had other problems  --  like the war against the Tibori . In fact , if you want to know the turning point in Peponi 's history , it was n't Quincy 's death at all . It was the Tibori @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of course most of the able-bodied men and women on Peponi volunteered for service , since the Yaronites and the Raboi were still at war with the Republic in the Core and the Spiral Arm , and most of our forces were needed elsewhere . The Republic 's biggest mistake was allowing us to use our wags . We did n't arm them , but we let them serve as noncombatants  --  such as cooks , couriers , and the like  --  since we were so shorthanded . The Tibori were dug in on five or six planets , and the action had degenerated into a ground war , since the Republic did n't want to totally obliterate such mineral-rich planets . We finally won , but it took us almost two years , and when we came back there was something different about the wags . They had seen Men being killed by the thousands , and had seen another alien race hold us off for almost two years even though we outnumbered them and had more firepower , and suddenly , for the first time , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we started hearing about Buko Pepon . He 'd been on Deluros VIII for about fifteen years , trying to drum up support for Peponi 's independence , and with Quincy dead he was finally able to get the Republic 's permission to organize a political party , even though wags were n't allowed to vote . He called it the Peponi Planetary Union , and he began lobbying the government in Berengi to grant the wags certain rights . Mostly they were little things , like being allowed to walk on Quincy Avenue , or the right to be represented by a wag lawyer in court ( which was ridiculous , since there were only two wag lawyers on the whole planet ) , things like that . In retrospect , we should have either given him everything he wanted or killed him right then and there , but we did n't . The colonial government granted the wags a few privileges in the hope that that would satisfy them , but Pepon kept lobbying for more . He had even written a book  --  The Peponi / Can Almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he was living on Deluros . There must have been half a million copies sold there before anyone on Peponi even knew it existed . When he finally returned to Peponi , he was arrested  --  but eventually they had to release him , since he had n't broken any laws and there was n't anything they could hold him for . That was our second big mistake , because it made him a hero , especially among the Bogoda . Pretty soon he was speaking to rallies , and even our own Bogoda were sneaking off the farm to attend them . Some of the other farmers punished their wags for having anything to do with Pepon , but Christina and I could see the handwriting on the wall : bit by bit he was going to get them more and more privileges until they finally wound up running the planet , and since it was our home and we planned to remain there , we decided to make our accommodation with the inevitable . I even let Caleb drag me along to listen to one of his I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for myself what he was saying , instead of reading all the scare stories in the newspapers . I can still remember my first sight of him . He was older than I thought , and he had a cloak made from the skin of a Bush Devil wrapped around a formal human outfit . He held the severed tail of a Silvercoat in one hand , and used it both as a flyswatter and a means of emphasizing his points . He was a totally charismatic figure , and he spoke for almost two hours . My Bogodan was never too good , so I did n't understand much of what he said , but from the enthusiastic responses of the crowd I got the gist of it , and I did n't like it . He wanted independence , which I had already known , and he wanted it immediately , which I had n't known . He never exactly called for armed rebellion , but he made it clear that the Bogoda 's patience was at an end . There was a certain urgency in his voice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over , Caleb led me through the crowd to meet him . I felt uneasy , for we were the only two humans there , but Caleb seemed not to notice or care ; I suppose that emotionally he was every bit as much a wag as Pepon was . " Ah , Mr. Crawford , " said Pepon in absolutely perfect Terran , " your son has mentioned you frequently to me . How nice of you to attend our little meeting . " " I 've read a lot about what you 've been preaching , " I replied . " I thought I ought to hear for myself . " " And now that you 've heard , what is your opinion ? " he asked . " I think you 're moving too fast , " I answered honestly . " If we left it to the government , there 'd be no movement at all ! " interjected Caleb heatedly . " It is impolite to interrupt your father , Caleb , " said Pepon gently . He smiled at me . " On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Have you a response to his statement , Mr. Crawford ? " " Yes , I do , " I said . " To the best of my knowledge , only p 117 seven members of your race have had a higher education . To be perfectly blunt about it , most of them still live like savages , and have no more interest in self-government than they have in advanced mathematics . How can you reasonably expect to form a functioning government ? " " Let me respond with a question of my own , " said Pepon . " There are less than a million Men of Peponi , while there are more than two hundred million of us . How long can you reasonably expect to keep us in bondage ? " " Not much longer , " I admitted . He smiled . " You see ? We do agree on at least one point . " " But we 'll have to educate an entire generation to become civil servants and bureaucrats , " I continued . He shook his head firmly . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not sacrifice yet another . " " No alien race has ever won an armed rebellion against the Republic . " " If you will read my book and study my speeches , you will find that I have never urged my people to take up arms . I have been to Deluros ; I know that we could never hope to match the military might of the Republic . " " Let me suggest that passive resistance wo n't be very effective , either , " I said . " I do not believe in passivity , " said Pepon firmly . " Then I do n't see how you can possibly achieve your goals . " " We will achieve them because they are just and honorable , " he said . " And historically inevitable . Peponi was wellnamed ; it can be a paradise for all of us , Mr. Crawford . " Suddenly his face hardened . " But if the promise of paradise is withheld from my people , then we must convince Man that it will no longer be a paradise for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a threat , " I said . " Oh , no , Mr. Crawford , " he said with a sudden smile . " Threats against the state are treasonable . It is merely a prediction . " p 118 Then he turned to speak to some of his followers who had come up behind Caleb and myself , and we went back to the farm . I kept a much closer eye on Pepon during the ensuing months , reading his speeches and following his activities through the various media , but after two years had passed it became obvious that he had not been able to carry his message much beyond his own Bogoda followers . A few Sorotoba and Kia joined his party , but most of them paid little or no attention to him , and he made absolutely no converts among the Sentabels , the Siboni , the Korani , or the other major tribes . It was then that he began changing the thrust of his arguments . No longer did we hear about independence . The Peponi Planetary Union became the Bogoda Political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attention became the Greenlands . This , he pointed out , was the Bogoda homeland , and now the Bogoda were forbidden by law to own their own property . The speeches became stronger and more frequent , all aimed at forcing the government to change its position . And then one morning we heard the news : the McElroy family , which lived about fifteen miles away , had been butchered in their sleep : even the five children , all under ten years of age , had been literally chopped to pieces . Two days later Jessamine Gaines found that her entire herd of Beefcakes had been mutilated : the genitals had been cut off all the males , and each Beefcake had had its left front foot chopped off . It was the beginning of the Kalakala Emergency , but nobody knew that for a few weeks . At first we thought these were isolated incidents , perhaps caused by a gang of Bogoda psychopaths . Then they hit the Preston farm , killing old Jim Preston and his two sons , but they left Mary Preston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police that her houseboy had let the killers in during dinner , and that she recognized four of them , two from her own squatters ' p 119 colony and two from Wilkes ' . She also heard the word " Kalakala , " but she had no idea what it meant . Three more families were killed and two farms were burnt to the ground by the time the government finally declared a State of Emergency . They sent an armed squad of soldiers to Pepon 's home , but he surrendered without a fight , and they had him on trial within a week . He was defended by a wag lawyer , and much to my surprise and chagrin I saw holos of my own son , Caleb , sitting at his table , whispering advice to him . It was on that day that I disowned Caleb . I'li Pepon claimed that he had never ordered his people to commit acts of violence , and while the record bore him out , it seemed so unlikely that they would do so without his con sent that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of hard labor in the frontier town of Balimora . He was taken there under heavy guard , and everyone assumed that that would be the end of it . A week later a group of 200 Bogoda overran a police station in the town of Marracho , mutilating and killing eleven human police officers , and we knew we were in a war . They were clever , the Kalakala . For one thing , nobody knew what " Kalakala " meant  --  the word does n't exist in the Bogoda language . To the best of my knowledge , nobody ever found out the meaning  --  to this day Pepon swears that even he does n't know  --  but it was a catchy concoction of sound , and it was easy for people to remember it once they 'd heard it . Also , as much as they terrorized the humans in the Greenlands , they were even worse to their own tribesmen . They made them take fearsome oaths and perform unspeakable acts to prove their loyalty , and they had no compunction about killing any Bogoda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that you did n't know who you could trust . You might have 300 Bogoda living on your place , and you p 120 knew with an absolute certainty that anywhere between five and fifty of them were Kalakala . It could be your houseboy , with instructions to unlock your doors in the dead of night , or your cook , who had been given poison to put in your food . It could be your stock men , who would mutilate your Beefcakes when the order came through , or even one of the old women , who would drop a vial of poison in your well on her way to the river to launder your clothes . Even when you caught one of them , it did n't do you any good . Those oathing ceremonies were so hideous and so intertwined with his primitive religion that he 'd happily die before he 'd tell you anything useful  --  and a lot of them did . Not a single prisoner taken during the first year ever implicated anyone else in the organization . By now the authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jailed Pepon . It was obvious , since he had been kept incommunicado , that he could n't be directing the Kalakala ; and it was just as obvious that he was the only wag alive who had the power to call them off . Rumor had it that they offered him his freedom if he would publicly disavow the Kalakala , and that he turned them down , saying that they had created the problem without his help and that they could solve it the same way . The Republic was too busy fighting its wars to give any aid to Peponi , and so a handful of policemen tried to cover the entire Greenlands . And since the Kalakala had infiltrated every farm , it was hardly surprising that there was never an attack on a farm that the police had staked out . It finally reached the point where most of us sent our women and young children into Berengi . Jessica refused to go  --  she was more passionately devoted to the farm than any of us ? but Christina and my daughter-in-law went into town to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had survived the attacks . p 121 I took to wearing a pistol even inside the house , and every night I locked all our wags into an enclosure . Daniel was off in the Jupiter Range , helping the police hunt for the Kalakala 's headquarters , but Thomas , Jessica , and I managed to keep the farm running . I Then one evening , after I had finished dinner , I became aware of a strong odor of smoke . I looked out the door and saw that my outbuildings were burning , and that there were wags running everywhere . Suddenly Bill raced up to the door . ! i " It is the Kalakala ! " he cried . " They have set fire to the barns ! " " Are your people all safe ? " I asked , checking my pistol to make sure it was charged . Yes , " he replied breathlessly . " But I have been unable to find Boss Thomas or Boss Jessica , " he added in worried tones . " Are they with you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer , and I im-mediately raced outside to search for them . An instant later two Bogoda , who had been crouching down below the windows , grabbed and disarmed me , and Bill approached me , a large dagger in his hand . " I am sorry that I must do this , Boss , " he said sincerely , as five or six more Bogoda set fire to my house . " Where are my children ? " I demanded , struggling futilely ! i to free myself . Ij " All except Boss Daniel are dead , " answered Bill . " Even Boss Caleb. " iii , " Caleb ? " I repeated . " But he defended Buko Pepon in court ! " I know , " replied Bill regretfully . He gestured to a fencepost , where they had hung Caleb 's severed head . His dead eyes stared at me through a cloud of insects . I looked at my son 's head and fought back the urge to vomit . p 122 " Why ? " I mumbled uncomprehendingly . " We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your son as mine . Why have you done this ? " " Because if we allowed Men like Boss Caleb to live , people would say , Oh , they are merely killing bad Men who have mistreated them . But if we kill Men like you and Boss Caleb and Boss Christina , they will know that we have done it to reclaim our homeland , and not out of personal hatred . I am sorry , but it is even more important that the good Men must die than the bad ones . " " That 's crazy ! " I said , still in shock . " You 're killing off the only Men who might make peace with you ! " " You talk too much ! " said one of the wags , and before I knew what he was doing he had pried open my mouth , pulled out my tongue , and severed it . So much blood gushed out of my mouth that I thought I was going to die right then and there , but suddenly Bill uttered a brief command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a police patrol had spotted the flames from my barn and had rushed to the farm , bristling with weaponry . They killed Bill and eight of the others , and somehow they managed to keep me alive until they could transport me to the Berengi hospital . They released me a month later , and I went back to the farm . All I found was the burnt skeleton of my house and the charred bodies of Thomas and Jessica . Caleb 's head was no longer on the fencepost , and though I spent half a day looking for it I never did find it . We left Peponi the next day . Daniel was killed about a year after that , while he and Wilkes and some others were tracking a Kalakala war party in the mountains . Thomas ' wife remarried and moved to Declan IV , and we 've pretty much lost touch with her . I loved that planet once . I thought I could build a life and a family there , but I was wrong . I thought we and the pI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for reasonable men . If I were you , young man , I 'd stick to writing about people like August Hardwycke and Catamount Greene . Their stories are a lot prettier than ours . p 124 I walked through the beautifully-kept and precisely-manicured park , following the winding walks and arched bridges , until I came to Wilkes , who was sitting alone on a bench . " I hope you do n't mind meeting me here in the park , " he said as I approached him . " I 'm glad that you agreed to speak with me at all , " I replied . " I know that it 's an imposition . " " Nonsense , " he said gruffly . " It 's not as if I 've got anything else to do with my time these days . When do you have to be back at Amanda 's ? " " She told me that she 'd be serving lunch at noon . " He checked his timepiece , squinting as the bright overhead sun reflected off its crystal . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly ought to be able to learn what you want to know by then . " He paused . " I want you to know that this is p 125 nothing personal ; ever since the Emergency , I invite no one I do n't know to my home . " " No apology is necessary , " I said , sitting down next to him and wishing I had some crumbs to feed to the avians that were boldly strutting around the bench . " I was n't apologizing , " he said irritably . " I was explaining . " " The Emergency seems to have changed everyone who experienced it , " I noted . " Watch your own family and friends get cut to ribbons , and and I guarantee it would change you too . " " I 'm sure it would , " I agreed . He stared at me for a long moment . " I thought you were writing a book about Hardwycke , " he said at last . " He was gone long before the Emergency . " " Peponi interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing another book about it . " " Then you ought to go there . " " Eventually I suppose I will , " I replied . " But as all of you pointed out last night , they 've rewritten a lot of the history books since Independence  --  so I 'd like your input as well . " He seemed to consider what I had said for a moment , then nodded his head curtly . " What 's the subject of this new book ? " he asked . I shrugged . " I do n't know yet . " " If it 's the Kalakala , forget it , " he said . " Damned near half the survivors wrote books about it . " " But that was decades ago , " I replied . " Everybody 's had time to reflect on it now , to see it in perspective . " " The only perspective I ever saw was in a forest on the side of the Jupiter Mountains , with a bunch of wags just out of sight who wanted my scalp as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neatly-cropped lawn and the gold-tinted trees that had been planted in precise mathematical patterns . " It was as wild as this is tame . " " Did you ever meet Buko Pepon personally ? " I asked . p 126 He spat on the ground . " If I 'd ever gotten close enough to meet him personally , he would n't be around now . " " Even though he was in jail during the Emergency ? " " Look , " said Wilkes , " maybe he was the leader of the Kalakala and maybe he was n't  --  but either way , there would n't have been any Kalakala if he had n't started giving them ideas . " He got to his feet . " I always take a walk this time of day , " he announced abruptly . " If you want to keep talking , you 're going to have to walk with me . " " I do n't mind . " He headed off at a brisk pace . " Doctor 's orders . I 've had problems with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those nights out in the cold and the rain , hunting for those bastards up and down the mountain range . " " Why did you confine your search to the Jupiter Mountains ? " I asked . " Because that 's where they were hiding , the ones who were n't on the farms or in Berengi . " He paused . " Look , they were fighting to throw us out of their homeland . Well , except for the Greenlands , the rest of their homeland was the Jupiter Range . Any given day , ninety percent of them were up there in the mountains . " " Crawford tells me that you were with his son Daniel when he died . " Wilkes nodded . " The kid was a damned good hunter , but he thought he was tracking animals instead of wags , and he got careless . Took him a long time to die ; I could hear him screaming all night long . We found what was left of him in the morning ; there was n't enough to bury . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , absently reaching down to pet an avian , which shrieked and fluttered away from me . " Did n't you have a farm to protect ? " " I had almost a thousand Beefcakes , " he answered . " One p 127 morning I found about half of them mutilated  --  ears hacked off , eyes plucked out , genitals slashed , tendons sliced . They were still alive , and I had to kill them . I decided no one was going to scare me off my place , so I got rid of all my wags and sat up every night , waiting for them to return . It took them a month , but they came back . I shot about a dozen of them , but they just kept coming . I took a poisoned arrow in my arm ; it must have been pretty weak poison , because it did n't kill me , though I did lose the arm . About the time the poison knocked me out they gave up charging the house , and I found out later that they settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barns . " He paused . " It was probably just as well that they did ; if the police had n't seen the flames , they would n't have arrived in time to save me . " He sighed deeply . " Well , after I got fitted out with a new arm , I went back and took one last look at the farm , realized that twenty years of work had been undone in a single evening , boarded up the house , packed my weapons , and volunteered for active duty against the Kalakala . The government was short-handed at the time  --  the Republic never gave us any military support until the third year of the Emergency  --  and since the police were tied down watching the Greenlands , they mostly used hunters and some of the loyal wags in the mountains . " He paused . " Your pal Hardwycke would have had the time of his life there . Tracking the Kalakala in the heavy forest took a lot more skill than walking up to a Landship on the open savannah and blowing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kalakala with professional hunters rather than soldiers ? " I asked , surprised . " We did n't have any soldiers , " he replied irritably . " Just the police . And they did n't have any experience in jungle warfare . The first two units they sent up into the mountains got lost , and the third got slaughtered . That 's when they decided that the hunters would at least be more at home with the terrain , and most of them had their own trackers . We even p 128 shipped a couple of thousand Siboni up to the Jupiter Range ; they hate the Bogoda , and they killed more than their share of them . Problem was , they also started raiding the villages at the foot of the mountains . It did n't make any difference to them who was Kalakala and who was n't ; they were just interested in killing any Bogoda they could find , so we finally had to send ' em back home . " " What was it like up there on the mountains ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grim and frightening . Usually when you got to where you thought the Kalakala were , you could n't see twenty feet ahead of you . Most days were uncomfortably hot ; the nights would drop to near freezing , and it rained five or six times a day . You 'd see a footprint at the edge of a forest , and you knew that there was a wag watching you , maybe carrying a spear , more likely carrying a laser pistol or a sonic gun he 'd stolen from one of the farms , and even your Dorado and Korani trackers could n't spot him . Or you 'd be walking atop a ridge , and you 'd see a party of Kalakala atop another ridge two miles away , and you knew that by the time you 'd climbed through the valley separating you from them they 'd be long gone , and that one night , when you least expected it , those same wags would sneak into your camp and try to slit you open from stem to stern . I remember the very first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mount Hardwycke , if that 's any use to you , though nowadays I think they call it Mount Pekana . I had about a dozen Dorado and Korani with me ; the Dorado were trackers , and the Korani were all armed with projectile rifles . We knew there were Kalakala in the area  --  the Dorado had seen signs of them  --  but we could n't find them , and at dusk we decided to make camp in a small clearing . I assigned two Korani to keep watch , and then I went to sleep . I woke up in the middle of the night , certain I 'd heard a rustling sound in the nearby bushes . I saw that the two lookp 129 outs had fallen asleep , so I took my rifle and pumped about twenty rounds into the bush where the noise had come from . All hell broke loose . The Korani started shooting in every direction , and the Dorado were running around the clearing , screaming and demanding to know what was happening , and avians started screeching , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scared out of his wits . When everyone had calmed down , I gave my two Korani lookouts hell for falling asleep on the job , and then we all approached the bush I had fired at to see how many Kalakala I had killed . You know what we found ? A dead Nightkiller , with eighteen of my bullets in him . That was just another hazard of hunting the Kalakala up there in the mountains . You were as likely to flush a Landship or a Thunderhead as a Kalakala , and they were just as dangerous . I think we must have blown away three animals for every Bogoda we killed , and they took their share of us too , especially in the denser regions of the forest , where we did n't have room to maneuver . Anyway , it was two weeks before we finally caught a Kalakala warrior , and even after we captured him he was n't much use to us . We could n't get any information out of him at all ; he finally died during one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Lamaki at the base of the mountains , and we  --  the colonists , not the police  --  used to meet at a bar called the Sabrehorn Inn . We 'd come down out of the mountains every couple of weeks , exchange information , get warm and dry for a day or two , and then go back to work . That was where I first met Felicia Preston . She was Jim Preston 's sister . She 'd been living on Pollux IV when she got word of the massacre up at his place . She came out to Peponi to bury Jim and his family , and stayed to fight the Kalakala . You just had to take one look at her to know she was something different . She had eyes that could pierce right through p 130 you , and hands as coarse and strong as any man 's . She was about twenty pounds underweight , but she had an air about her that made you think that if she ever got into a freehand fight with a Bush Devil , you 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever asked her what she had done for a living back on Pollux , and she never volunteered it , but it made you wonder . Those were hard men at the Sabrehorn , men who had n't seen a bed or a woman for months , but she did n't back down from any of them . And bit by bit she began bringing information down out of the mountains , stuff that no one else had been able to get . One time it was the name of the Kalakala oathgiver in the Bagenzi District , another time it was a list of all the Kalakala on the Griswold farm , and one night she even told us when and where they planned to strike next . Now , you have to understand that we 'd been trying for almost a year to get this kind of intelligence , and here was this woman , not even one of us , who 'd gone right up into the mountains and come back down with it . Most people left her strictly alone when she was in town , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked if my wags and I could join her party when she went up the mountain the next morning . She just stared at me for a minute , then shrugged and nodded . She did n't say a word to me all evening , but she was waiting for me the next morning with her two Dorado trackers . We were well into the forest by noon , and then one of her trackers pointed to a small thornbush . A couple of blue threads had been caught on it , and suddenly our entire party became silent and alert . Her trackers and my six Dorado scoured the area for more signs of Kalakala , but with no success . Finally she summoned her two wags , whispered a terse command , and then sat down propped up against a tree . She told me to do likewise , but I said that I thought we should keep looking for the Kalakala . PARADISE : A CHRONICLE OF A DISTANT WORLD 131 " Forget it , " she said . " They 're gone . If they were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then let 's try to pick up their trail , " I said . She shrugged . " You do what you want . Just do n't make too much noise as you go up the mountain . I 'm not in the rescue business . " " Do you just plan to sit here all day ? " I demanded . " Most of the day , anyway , " she answered . " Their trail 's too well covered . I 'll catch up to them tonight . " " How ? " " Even Kalakala have to drink . I told my wags to hunt up all the nearby water holes . " " And if they drink from a stream ? " I said , annoyed . " What will we do  --  stake out all two or three miles of it ? " " There is n't any running water around here , Wilkes , " she replied . " That 's why I chose this part of the mountain . " " How do you know ? It 's never been mapped . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mapped it the first two weeks I was here . " " What else did you map ? " I asked . " All their hideouts . Mostly they live in caves , but now and then they 'll camp out in the woods . " " Then why do n't we just move in and hit ' em ? " " Because they never stay in the same spot for more than a day or two , and I found more than fifty of their hideouts . " She shook her head . " No , Wilkes , there 's no sense wasting effort and energy and letting them know we 're here . My wags will find out which water hole they 're using , and with a little luck we 'll pick them up tonight . " I stared at her for a minute , and she matched my gaze , unblinking . " We 've all caught Kalakala parties at one time or another , " I said at last . " I want to know why you 're the only one who can make them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . Then p 132 she pulled her hat over her eyes to shield them from the sunlight and folded her arms loosely across her chest . I did n't know if she was asleep , or merely tired of talking to me , but the end result was the same : I sat in silence for the next three hours , ignoring the heat and the bugs , until one of her Dorado came back and whispered something to her . " All right , Wilkes , " she said , rising quickly to her feet . " We 're in business . My wags found the place where they drank this morning . " " Where 's the other one ? " I asked . " He 's got it staked out , in case they come back before we get there . " Without another word she began following her Dorado , and my wags and I fell into step behind her . The water hole was only four miles away , but between the altitude and the terrain it took us almost three hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorado dropped lightly out of a tree and indicated that no one had come while he was on watch . We took up a position in some thick bushes , about thirty yards from the water hole , and waited . It started raining , and the temperature dropped about thirty degrees . I sat with my back propped up against a tree , cold and wet and shivering , but she never seemed to notice it . Shortly after nightfall I heard what seemed like an avian trilling , and she poked me with an elbow . " What is it ? " I whispered . " They 're coming , " she replied softly . " There 'll probably be a dozen or so . " She paused . " Shoot to maim the three closest . Kill the rest . " " What about females and children ? " " If you see any , kill them , " she said emotionlessly . We waited in silence for another two or three minutes , and then the Kalakala broke cover . There were nine of them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt her hand on mine . p 133 She mouthed the words , " Not yet , " then returned her attention to the wags . Six of them had reached the water hole , and the other three positioned themselves around it , peering intently into the bushes , obviously acting as sentries as the first six filled their gourds and carrying skins . Then , before I realized that she was even aiming her rifle , three explosions rang out and the three sentries dropped to the ground . I shot the two closest in the legs , then looked for another target and found that Felicity had taken care of them . Two other Kalakala lay writhing on the ground , while the last two were perfectly still . " Good work , Wilkes , " she said , rising and walking over to the scene of the carnage . She withdrew a hunting knife and carved a crude " F " on the torsos of the five dead warriors . " So the Kalakala will know who did it , " she said , anticipating my question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clearing , and I signaled my own wags to do likewise . " Tie ' em up , " she ordered , and a moment later her Dorado had thoroughly trussed up the four survivors . All four had been shot in the legs ; two had shattered kneecaps , another had most of his foot blown away , and a fourth was bleeding profusely from two wounds in his upper thigh . " Now tell them that I only need information from one wag , " she replied . " The other three are meat for the Nightkillers . Tell them that the first one who tells me where John Pragranzi is hiding gets to live . " The Dorado translated her message into Bogoda . All four captives stared sullenly at her , their jaws set , their mouths tightly shut . " All right , " she said . " Tell them they can talk with one eye as well as two . " " What are you going to do ? " I demanded . " Just what I said , " she replied coldly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's responsible for the butchery at p 134 the Blandings farm last week . " She turned to the Kalakala . " Any answers ? " They continued to stare at her . " This is going to hurt you a lot more than it hurts me , " she said , grabbing one of them by the fur atop his head . " You 're actually going to cut his eye out ? " I said . " Did you see what they did to my brother and his family ? " she responded . " If it bothers you , do n't look . " She reached forward with the knife , and I watched , fascinated , as she removed his left eye and the Kalakala gave vent to a hideous scream of agony . " Your turn , " she said , approaching the next one . By the time she walked up to the third , he told her everything she wanted to know about Pragranzi 's whereabouts and future plans . I expected her to let them go then , but instead she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one shot into each of their heads . Then she nodded to her Dorado , who immediately cut off the hands , feet , ears , and genitals of all nine dead Kalakala and tossed them into the water hole . " You look pale , Wilkes , " she said when the mutilations were done . " I 'm fine , " I assured her gruffly . " You 'd better be , " she replied , " because the only way to fight fire is with fire . You 're not going to beat a bunch of savages by being an officer and a gentleman ; there 's no conventional way to fight a guerrilla war in these mountains and in this type of cover . And you wo n't frighten them with the threat of long jail sentences ; most of them will be warmer , drier , and better-fed in prison than they ever were out here . You 've got to show them that Man can be more brutal and more savage than any enemy he has to face . If they chop off an ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leg ; if they burn a farm , you 've got to burn a village . You may not like it , but p 135 it 's the only way to fight something like Kalakala , and those who are n't up to it had better pack their bags and find themselves another world . " It was the longest speech I ever heard her make . The truest , too . Once we got back to Lamaki and word got out about her success , we all began applying her methods . It was grim , bloody work , work that made you forget what being a Man was all about , but it was effective . Within a year the Kalakala were as scared of us as we were of them . We asked no quarter on that damned mountain , and we gave none . If we could n't find them , we 'd poison their water . If they took to hoarding water , we 'd butcher their meat animals . If they went off on a raid and left their females and children behind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise waiting for them when they got back . They 'd spent three years killing any Bogoda who would n't join their cause ; we started killing any Kalakala who would n't recant his oaths  --  and if he did recant and there were no authorities around , we killed him anyway . They used the name of Buko Pepon as a rallying cry ; we began carving an " F " on every wag we killed , and before long they started thinking that Felicia Preston was everywhere . If Pepon was bigger than life to them , than Felicia was bigger than death . Then , after another year passed , the Republic was finally able to spare us a few divisions , and that was the beginning of the end . They started making daily bombing runs on the Jupiter Range , blowing thousands of Kalakala and tens of thousands of animals to pieces . One by one the various gangs of Kalakala would come down out of the mountains and surrender , but there were a few holdouts , and we went back into the mountains after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the mountain , damned near freezing to death in their rags , and finally p 136 we captured James Praznap when he sneaked into a local village for food . He was their top general , and the holos of his hanging even made the Deluros papers . That broke the back of the Kalakala , taking Praznap . The State of Emergency continued officially for another five years , but for all practical purposes it was over . We 'd won the war , and life should have gone back to normal . But it did n't . The Republic had gotten a little too greedy , had tried to colonize too many worlds , and suddenly what happened on Peponi was happening all over the galaxy . The Canphor Twins revolted again , and the Lodin system became a war zone , and before long the Navy was spread so thin that the Secretary decided that he 'd better start making the best bargains he could with some of these worlds or in a few centuries his successors would be presiding over an empire that controlled just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one by one , the Republic began giving each recalcitrant world its independence , trying to get rid of the problem planets before all the others got the idea of rebelling . I t worked , too : they granted Independence to twenty-six worlds , and kept the other thousand-plus in the fold . They had to grant certain social and economic rights here and there , but they avoided a galaxy-wide revolution . Peponi was fifteenth in line for Independence , once they took care of the real trouble spots like Canphor VI and VII and Lodin XI . Then , a year before Independence became official , they looked around to see who was likely to become the President of the planet , and they did n't like what they saw : every potential leader was a veteran of the Emergency and had been radicalized to the point where there was a very real possibility that they would massacre the human population and withdraw Peponi completely from the Republic 's sphere of influence . There was Bago Baja , who was the pro tern p 137 leader of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kia who had been educated on one of the Canphor Twins , and finally they decided that Buko Pepon , even though he was probably responsible for the Kalakala , was the most modcrate leader they had , so they commuted his sentence and turned the old devil loose . And that was it . We 'd seen our people mutilated and butchered , finally beat the bastards into submission and went back to our farms  --  and the goddamned Republic turned the planet over to the wag who had started it all . A year later they gave him permission to form a provisional government , and three months after that the Secretary of the Republic himself officially recognized Buko Pepon as the President of Peponi . Suddenly Men began leaving the planet , and every time a Man left , a wag moved into his place . They not only held cvery position in the government , but they started moving i'II into the Greenlands . Before another year had passed my two closest neighbors were wags , and my own wags , once they moved back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even started forming an army and a navy . I do n't know who the hell he thought would want to invade his god-damned planet ; the only people who ever wanted to live there were Men , and he was driving us out . Anyway , I went into Berengi one day to pick up some supplies , and once I got there I stopped and looked  --  really looked  --  at what was going on . Half the stores were run by wags , all the police officers were wags , looking like buffoons in their human uniforms , there were wags walking everywhere , bumping into Men without apologizing , driving landcars , even drinking in the Thunderhead Bar . We won the damned war with the Kalakala . I know  --  I was there . The Republic gave us three years to enjoy our victory , and p 138 then they pulled the rug out from under us . They took a wag who had been found guilty of treason  --  and instead of killing him , they turned the whole planet over to him and treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It made me ashamed to be a Man , and that 's when I knew it was time to leave Peponi forever . p 139 " It 's lovely out here , " I commented . " Is n't it ? " agreed Amanda Pickett , as Nora served us our soup . We were sitting outside , on her shaded backyard patio , which was surrounded by carefully-tended shrubbery and a variety of avianhouses . " Did you have an interesting discussion with Wilkes ? " " Yes , " I said . " He 's a very bitter man . " " He has a right to be . He spent four terrible years in the mountains . " She paused to sip a spoonful of her soup , then nodded her approval , which seemed to be a signal for Nora to return to the kitchen . " I assume that 's what you talked about ? " I nodded . " He seems more upset about the aftermath . " " Well , from his point of view , the Republic encouraged him to fight for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " The others did n't seem as outraged . " p 140 " Others ? " she asked curiously . " The people I met last night , " I said , taking a spoonful of soup . " I assume each of them was involved in the Emer-gency ? " " You could n't live in the Greenlands and not be involved , " replied Amanda . She paused long enough to take a piece of a cracker and throw it on the ground , where a small blue-andwhite avian swooped down , picked it up , and strutted off holding it proudly in its mouth . " Even Malcolm Pepper got involved in the fighting . " " He certainly did n't strike me as the type . " " When your house and land are under attack , you become the type very quickly , " said Amanda , breaking up another cracker and tossing it onto the ground , where a variety of tiny avians happily fell to eating the pieces . " I meant that he would seem more at home at an opera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for savages . " I suddenly became aware of the fact that Nora was staring at me , but it was too late to retract what I had said , so I did my best to pretend that I did n't notice her . She stood motionless for a moment , then took away our soup dishes and replaced them with a plate on which there were a number of little triangular sandwiches . " Not everyone fought in the mountains , " said Amanda . " One of the first things the government did was increase the security around Balimora . " " Balimora ? " I repeated . " The frontier town where Pepon was imprisoned . Malcolm volunteered for duty there , and spent the next few years living with hundred-degree heat and dust . Six separate attempts were made to free Pepon during the Emergency ; Malcolm took a spear in the leg . and a bullet in the shoulder while defending the jail . " She paused . " When it 's wet or cold out , you can see that he still has a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little man ! " I mused . " I would n't have believed it . " Nora returned with some wine . Amanda took a sip , nodded her approval , and then continued : " When he finally returned to the Greenlands , he found that his house had been burned down , his wells had been poisoned , and all his animals were missing , either dead or stolen to feed the Kalakala . " " So he emigrated ? " I asked . She smiled . " You do n't know Malcolm Pepper . He liquidated his assets and went into the insurance business . " " I beg your pardon ? " " The major insurance companies blacklisted Peponi after the Emergency , " she explained . " But Malcolm suspected that , with Independence in the offing , the Bogoda would be on their best behavior  --  so he began insuring the larger hotels and stores in Berengi , quickly expanded his business to other cities and towns , and made a fortune before the big companies decided that it was safe to reenter the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fascinating ! " I said . " He traveled around the Republic for the next decade , " she went on , " dabbling in a little of this and a little of that , and finally he heard that Jessamine and I were living here in the Barton system , came to visit us , and decided to make Barton IV his home  --  though he 's still away on business more than half the time . " " What was Jessamine 's role in the Emergency ? " I asked between mouthfuls . " She 's a very interesting woman , " replied Amanda thoughtfully . " She outlived four husbands , all of whom were dead before the Emergency . I believe that the Crawfords named their daughter Jessica in honor of her . Anyway , after the killing started , she refused to leave her farm . She made her Bogoda leave , though , and replaced them with Siboni . The Kalakala p 142 made three raids on her farm during the Emergency ; Jessamine and her Siboni held them off all three times . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kalakala . She stayed until Independence , then legally sold her farm to her Siboni  --  I think that all of ten credits changed hands ; she was never going to let it fall into Bogoda hands  --  and left for Deluros VIII . But she learned what we all learned : once you 've lived on Peponi , you ca n't be happy on a planet like Deluros . You need water and green things , not streets and skyscrapers , and finally she came to Barton IV . " I finished the last of my tiny sandwiches , looked around for more , could n't find any , and felt awkward about asking , so I simply sipped my wine and considered my next question . " Where did Felicia Preston wind up ? " I asked . " Ever since Crawford told me his story last night , I 've been toying with the notion of putting together a book of reminiscences about the Emergency . Not political or sociological or anything like that ; just expatriates telling their stories in their own words . " I paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Did n't Wilkes tell you ? " asked Amanda , surprised . " Tell me what ? " " She died about two years into the Emergency . " " No , he did n't say anything about it , " I replied . " Did the Kalakala get her ? " Amanda shook her head . " She contracted pneumonia up in the mountains , and while she was trying to fight it off she contracted another disease , something that was carried by the mites she picked up in the forest . One of her Dorado trackers ran to Lamaki for help , but she died before they could get back to her . " " I wonder why Wilkes did n't tell me that ? " " Perhaps because he 's used to keeping secrets , " said Amanda . " I do n't understand . " " It was decided not to let the Kalakala know that the Great p 143 Human Sorceress was dead , " explained Amanda . " They buried her in secret , and Wilkes killed her two Dorado trackers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later he told everyone that Felicia had been ambushed and wounded on the mountain . I think that was when they all began carving Felicia 's initials on the Kalakala corpses , though they may have started doing it even earlier . " " If it was such a secret , why did Wilkes tell you ? " I asked . " He did n't , " she replied . " Not while we were all on Peponi . But twenty years after a war is over there 's not much need for military secrecy , and he let it drop one day when he was visiting me here . Until that day , most of us thought Felicia had fought until the end of the Emergency and then gone back to Pollux IV , though no one was ever able to track her down to give her the medals that she had been awarded . " I finished my wine and leaned back comfortably on my chair , sorting out the various things she had told me . Then another question occurred to me . " You know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you never mention your role during the Emergency . " My role was rather ambiguous , " she replied . " In what way ? " " I had become friends with Buko Pepon while I was at college on Deluros , and I had set up inoculation and education programs for not just my own Bogoda , but for most of those who lived in the Greenlands . Also , as you could doubtless tell from my biography of Commodore Quincy , I thought his policies , while they temporarily benefited the colonists , would ultimately lead to disaster . In fact , I had been one of the very few colonists to lobby for the rights of the native population prior to the Emergency . When the reason behind the Kalakala outbreak became known , my loyalties were divided : I disapproved of their methods , but not their goal . I did n't want to see them slaughtered , and I did n't want to be killed by p 144 them , so I left the planet and sat out the Emergency on Roosevelt III . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind and fight . He was killed on Mount Hardwycke about four months after I left . " A cool breeze swept across the yard , and Amanda suggested that we adjourn to the study for coffee . I followed her inside , where we seated ourselves on a long sofa and she continued her story . " I corresponded with Buko Pepon throughout the Emergency . " She smiled reminiscently . " He later told me that my letters were the only ones he received that were n't censored . " " What did you write about ? " I asked as Nora entered the room with a silver service and poured coffee for us . " I wrote a few letters about the brutality being exhibited by both sides in the conflict , and some others about the kind of government I hoped one day to see on Peponi , " she replied . " But mostly they were about little things , the things I missed on Roosevelt III and that I knew he missed in prison : the magnificent sunsets in the Greenlands , the way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rains began , the lame wildbuck I had raised as a pet , the senseless slaughter of the Landships . . . I wrote about memories and feelings that we had in common . Many of these memories later became bits and pieces of Peponi Days . " " And Pepon ? " I said . " What did he write to you ? " " He wrote about many of the same things , but of course he was more concerned with the direction Peponi would take after the Emergency was over . Almost everyone expected him to die in that hot little prison cell , but he always seemed to know , deep in his soul , that his work was n't completed yet , that he would survive to lead Peponi to independence . There must have been times when that belief was all that kept him going . " " Do his letters still exist ? " I asked . pI 145 " I turned them over to the Berengi Museum some years ago . " " I 'd like to see them someday . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He speaks Terran much better than he writes it . . . and of course , the letters were heavily censored . " She paused , as if deciding whether or not to tell me something more . Finally she added : " I destroyed the last four that he wrote . " " Why ? " " They were written after I told him that I probably would n't be coming back to Peponi . He urged me to return so fervently that I thought they could be misinterpreted , so I burnt them . " " Why was he so insistent that you come back ? " I asked . " I think it was because he , alone of the Bogoda , could foresee what would happen if all the colonists were to leave after Independence . We had abandoned other worlds in the past  --  agricultural worlds where there were serious climactic changes , mining worlds that were played out  --  and each of them reverted to semibarbarism once we took our technology away with us . " She paused . " Because I had written the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more visible than most of the human settlers , and of course I was a second-generation colonist . I would have made a very nice symbol that he could point to , a human whose family had been here almost from the beginning and who was willing to stay here under a native government . " She smiled . " And there was something else ... " " Oh ? What ? " " He wanted me to write his biography . " " Is he that much of an egotist ? " " What politician is n't an egotist ? " she replied . " Also , a biography written by a wag would never be marketable anywhere except on Peponi ; however , a biography written by a human would circulate throughout the Republic and possibly pI 146 encourage more investment and immigration  --  especially if it was written after the Emergency , and most especially if it absolved him of all complicity . " " What was his reaction when you turned him down ? " I asked . " He never officially asked me . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was too busy lobbying for independence and forming a government to give it much thought . We still correspond from time to time , and he still hints at it on occasion , but he knows that I 'm not going to do it , and I think he suggests it more as a courtesy than from any serious expectation that I might reconsider . " " Why did n't you write it ? " I asked . " After all , you accepted a commission to write Quincy 's biography , and you disagreed with his policies . " " I did n't write it because I feel an author should know her subject : any book about Buko Pepon must necessarily be about Peponi , and I no longer know Peponi . It 's been more than thirty years since I last set foot on it , and the Peponi I remember is not the Peponi that exists today . My Peponi exists in Peponi Days , and my holograph albums , and my father 's diaries . " Suddenly she stood up . " Which reminds me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me get them for you . She left the room for a moment , then came back with four thick leatherbound volumes cradled lovingly in her arms . She brought them over to the couch and handed them to me . " The writing is blurred in places , " she warned me , " and his handwriting is n't the most legible . " She took the top volume from me and began thumbing through it , then stopped about a third of the way through . " Do you see this ? " she said , pointing to a tiny pawprint . " It 's from a Demoncat cub that my father brought home after he 'd had to shoot the mother , which had been killing our livestock . We kept it for almost p 147 five months before it died . I do n't think any Demoncat of any age has ever survived longer in captivity . " She turned the pages again , and stopped at a crude drawing of a native face with an intricately-designed pattern overlaid on it . " This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she explained . " He was a minor chief named Chachma , and he became a close friend of my father 's . I used his grandson as my headman for a few years , just after I returned from college on Deluros VIII . " She went through the books , showing me tidbits from Peponi 's history : a drawing of the incredibly rare Hardwycke 's wildbuck , which was now extinct ; some bloodstains from the time her father had killed a Bush Devil that attacked him on his own veranda , and had then written up the episode before even washing the blood from his hands ; the actual faded red and gold feather , pressed between two pages , of an avian her father had shot and had never been able to identify . In the back of the first diary were her father 's phonetic translations of Bogoda , Siboni , and Sorotoba , written down during the period when he was trying to learn the various native dialects . " I 'm afraid I ca n't allow you to take them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have Nora make copies of them for you , if you will sign an agreement to use them only for search and never attempt to publish them . " " I 'll be happy to sign the agreement , " I said . " But given their historical importance , do n't you think they should be published someday ? " " They will be , " she answered . " I 've made an arrangement I with my publisher to bring them out in a matched edition with my own diaries after my death . " " It should provide fascinating reading , " I said . " Only to scholars with an obsessive interest in Peponi 's history , " she replied . " Neither of us expected our Peponi diaries to see print , and they lack a certain felicity of expresp 148 sion . I have an almost irresistible urge to rewrite them , but that would completely destroy whatever historical significance they might possess . " She called for Nora , handed the diaries over to her , and instructed her to make copies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Amanda , " so why do n't we move to the living room ? " I got up and followed her . " May I offer you a drink , Matthew ? " " Not right now , thank you , " I said , seating myself on a large , cushioned chair . " You seem preoccupied , " she noted after I had been silent for a few moments . " I was thinking about Nora , " I admitted . " What about her ? " asked Amanda . " She puzzles me . " " In what way ? " " I keep wondering why she should be content to remain a servant when she could be totally free on Peponi ? " " She 's totally free here , " answered Amanda . " But she works at a menial job , " I said . " She works , " repeated Amanda , emphasizing the word . " There is every possibility that she would be unable to find work on Peponi , and she certainly could n't earn as much therm as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she find work ? " I asked . " Because most of the wags are still subsistence farmers , and their attitude toward females is , shall we say , unenlightened . " " Oh ? " She nodded . " Even as gifted a leader as Buko Pepon ca n't move an entire society out of the bush in one generation , " she said . " And it will be many more generations before dr. males achieve equality in Peponian society . " " I see , " I said . " There is just so much one man can do , " she continued ,  | " Or one wag . And of course , he 's hindered by his culture , just as all of us are . " " Hindered in what way ? " " He has four wives , " she said . " You can hardly expect him to view females as equals . " " Did he treat you as an equal ? " I asked . " Yes . . . but I 'm a member of an alien race . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . To him , we 're all Men , with a capital M. " " What is his attitude toward Men ? " " Personally or politically ? " " Both , " I said . " I really do n't know what he thinks of humans personally , " she replied . " I know he numbers some of us among his friends , but he has a very complex and secretive nature , and most of his true feelings are closely guarded . " " What about politically ? " " He knows he needs us , and . he 's willing to do almost anything to keep us , " said Amanda . " When the Emergency was over and he was given official permission to form a government , most of the colonists , especially those in the Greenlands , were very uneasy . There were rumors of mass deportations , and even renewed violence . Finally Pepon called a meeting at the Sabrehorn Inn in Lamaki  --  he uses symbolism whenever he can , and the Sabrehorn was the counterinsurgents ' headquarters  --  and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and no media . He told them that both sides had made serious errors and suffered greatly , but that that was all in the past . He said that he was willing to forgive and forget all previous abuses , including his imprisnment , if they would do the same , and that he wanted them stay and help him create a planet that would provide opportunities for all of its inhabitants . The human colonists were frcc to retain their land and their various business holdings , nd he wanted their input in creating a constitution they could p 150 all live with . He then announced that the new slogan for his political party was the word Karabunta , which means Together ' in Bogoda . " She paused , smiling at the recollection . " You ca n't imagine the effect this speech had on his audience . They had come there half-expecting to be dispossessed , and they wound up being asked to stay on their farms and to offer suggestions about the nature of the new planetary government . They gave him a standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of them actually stayed ? " " Almost all of them , at least in the beginning , " answered Amanda . " Those who had made their plans to leave did n't bother to attend the meeting . " She paused again . " I would estimate that half of them are still there , which is n't all that bad , given Peponi 's economy and its other problems . A number of others still keep vacation houses on the planet ; hunting may have been disallowed , but there are still game-viewing safaris and thousands of miles of untouched beaches all along the coasts . " " Which brings up an interesting question , " I said . " Oh ? " she said curiously . " Why did you never go back ? " I asked . " You were n't there for the fighting , so you could n't have any bad memories of it . " " Other than losing my husband , you mean ? " " I apologize , " I said promptly . " I had forgotten . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The truth of the matter is that it had nothing to do with my husband . I knew when I left that I would never return . " " Then let me ask you again , " I said . " Why have you stayed away all these years ? " " The Peponi I left was not the Peponi I had learned to love . Everything was changing . The mornings when you could wake up and see Sabrehorns and Landships ambling across p 151 your property , when there were huge chunks of unexplored territory for men like Fuentes and Greene to tame , when Berengi was a small town filled with colonists rather than a city filled with strangers . . . they were all gone long before the Kalakala . Peponi was a world on the road to adulthood , and it had lost the innocence of its youth , as all worlds must . " She sighed and looked out a window , staring into Peponi 's past , as I had seen Hardwycke do so many times . " I have had my fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trappings of luxury , " she said at last . " I 've lived a full , productive , active life , and I am ashamed of nothing I 've ever done . " She slowly turned to me . " But do you know something interesting , Matthew ? I 'd trade it all to have been on Peponi when August Hardwycke first set foot there , when there was a young world spread out before him , all his for the taking . " She paused . " Is n't that the strangest thing ? " she said with a bittersweet little smile . p 155 Three years had passed since I had visited Amanda Pickett at her home on Barton IV . In the interim , the Hardwycke biography had come out and died a very quick death . To this day I do n't know why . Some critics claimed that , despite the charm of some of his stories , it was very difficult to empathize with a man who made his living by killing animals , and who , by his own admission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But whatcver the reason , the book itself appeared only on Deluros VIII and quickly vanished without a trace . Even the disks and tapes never made it out of the Deluros system before being remaindered , and that  --  or so I thought  --  was the end of it . My next project fared considerably better . It was entitled The ' Expatriates , and was a collection of verbal memoirs of those humans who had survived the State of Emergency on Peponi . I began it with a brief historical summary of the period , then p 156 segued into a series of firsthand reminiscences , which included those of Crawford , Wilkes , and some twenty-one other Peponi expatriates who had agreed to speak to me about their experiences . I had originally hoped to get Amanda Pickett to read the manuscript and add her own comments to the final chapter , but before I could do so I received word that she had died in a traffic accident on Barton IV . Nonetheless , the book garnered considerable critical acclaim and was a commercial success , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to capitalize on the publicity surrounding The Expatriates , and reissued the Hardwycke biography with a new title  --  and it , too , began selling well . And suddenly , despite the fact that I had still never been within 200 light years of Peponi , I found myself in great demand . Requests began piling up for articles on Landships , on Hardwycke , on hunting , on the Emergency , on virtually all aspects of Peponian life . I accepted four assignments from the most prestigious markets , sent them off , and , feeling that I had earned a vacation , I closed down my apartment and took off for a month of sun and sea on the Inner Frontier planet of Brandywine . When I returned home , I found a most interesting message waiting for me on my computer . The Office of the President of Peponi had offered to transport me there at its own expense to discuss a project that I was assured would be to our mutual benefit . If I was interested , I was to contact a human named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodging arrangements and would act as my personal guide for as long as I was on the planet . I accepted at once . I had been planning to visit Peponi anyway  --  I felt increasingly guilty about being considered an expert on a world that I had never visited  --  and a week later I was notified by the local spaceport that my ticket was waiting for me , and that my flight departed in three days . There was p 157 also a list of all the various inoculations and pills I would need , as well as the name of a local doctor who had been instructed to bill the Peponi government for his work . I felt a bit like a walking pincushion by the time I boarded the spaceship , and I spent most of the first two days sleeping before I felt well enough to examine the recreational facilities . I found a trio of young women who had just returned from Northpoint , a world on the Inner Frontier , and were infatuated with an alien game they had learned called jabob . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days playing it with them before they departed on Barsoti V. I then elected to go into Deepsleep for the remaining week of the trip . I was awakened about five hours before we were due to land on Peponi , and I suddenly remembered what it was that I hated about traveling in Deepsleep . Your body 's metabolism slows down to a crawl , but it does n't stop  --  if it did , you would be dead  --  and upon waking up you are literally starving to death . However , your muscles have atrophied just enough so that it takes you about ten minutes to be able to move around without any pain or stiffness , by which time you 're seriously toying with eating the ship 's bulkheads . You invariably overeat once you get to the dining room , and spend your final four hours in the ship 's infirmary , where the doctor invariably gives sou an amused lecture about self-control before he relieves the agony in your stomach . By the time I was feeling healthy again , the passengers were transferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various continents as we descended  --  the Great Eastcrn , the Great Western , the Ice Bowls , and the Dust Bowl ? but there was too much cloud cover for me to identify any of them except the Northern Ice Bowl . Before long we began braking , and a few minutes later I stepped through the airlock and followed my fellow passengers , most of them vacationers laden with expensive holographic cameras , down the ramp to p 158 a nearby slidewalk , which soon deposited us in the main receiving room of the spaceport . I then stood in line while a pair of natives in impressive uniforms examined each passport , and frequently inspected the travelers ' luggage as well . Most of the native passengers were passed right through , but off-wonders usually had a hit more difficulty . One of the inspectors found a new type of telescopic lens that he obviously had n't seen before , held it up , turned it every which way to determine what it was , and finally pressed a button on his computer panel . Another gaudily-uniformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second passport inspector joined him , and the three of them spent about ten minutes looking at the lens and discussing whether it might be a sniperscope smuggled in by a would-be assassin . Finally they returned the lens to its owner and let him through , and then I stepped up and handed over my passport . " Welcome to Peponi , " said my passport inspector in broken Terran . " Thank you . " " Are you here for business or pleasure ? " " Business . " He stared at me , as if trying to determine the nature of my business , then shrugged and stamped my passport . " Next ! " he called , and I passed through to the main reception area . Three natives came up to me , none of them speaking Terran , but all obviously determined to carry nuy luggage for me . " No , thank you , " I said , looking around for anyone who might be Ian Masterson . They persisted , and one of them actually got into a brief tug-of-war with me when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm waiting for someone , " I said , yanking the bag back and walking to a chair . p 159 They followed me , still speaking in their own language , and remained with me for about five minutes , until they finally realized that I had no intention of leaving the spaceport . Then , one by one , they drifted away , looking for some other tourist with luggage . A number of tour guides were walking through the area , holding large printed signs over their heads . One represented an outfit called Sabrehorn Tours , another was Landship Vacations , a third was Mount Pekana Excursions , and so on . As they progressed they were joined by various tourists who recognized the names of the companies with which they had contracted . Finally a lean , wiry blond man in his fifties , wearing a pair of tan shorts and a matching shirt , approached me . " Matthew Breen ? " he asked . " Yes ? " " I 'm Ian Masterson , " he replied , extending his hand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the spaceport . " He looked down at my two suitcases . " Is this all your luggage ? " " Yes . " He barked out something in a dialect I had never heard before , and two natives immediately approached us . He gave a further order , and each of them picked up one of my bags . " I 've arranged for you to stay at the Royal Hotel , " he said . " We 've got newer ones , but they 're a blight on the landscape . The service is terrible , and you get none of the special flavor of Peponi . " He paused . " You 'll be staying in the same suite of rooms that Johnny Ramsey once stayed in . " He smiled . " Of course , they 've been remodeled four or five times since then , but they still have the feel of the old days about them . " He led the way to a large parking lot , then stopped beside a landcar and pointed to the back , where the two natives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note and sent them back to the spaceport.
