General Dynamics Corp. said it will write off two-thirds of its $663 million investment in Cessna Aircraft Co. less than 15 months after purchasing the light plane manufacturer . The St. Louis-based defense contractor blamed a continuing slump in the general aviation market for its failure to revive the struggling Cessna unit . " The market has stabilized at the current levels with no apparent recovery seen in the foreseeable future , " General Dynamics said . General Dynamics said it plans to write off $420 million , or $9. 80 a share , in the fourth quarter because of its problems with Cessna . A company spokesman said the write-off will result in a loss for the fourth quarter . In the 1985 fourth quarter , General Dynamics had net income of $90. 4 million , or $2. 13 a share , on sales of $2. 26 billion . The defense contractor said neither Cessna nor the general aviation market as a whole had recovered as expected since General Dynamics purchased the Wichita , Kan. - based company in October 1985 . General Dynamics said its general aviation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losses of about $60 million for the first nine months of 1986 . A spokesman declined to speculate on Cessna ' s future , but the company said its production of business jets and utility aircraft is continuing . The company said the Cessna unit contributed about $122 million of General Dynamics ' s total sales of $2. 27 billion for the third quarter of 1986 . Cessna comprises a relatively small part of General Dynamics ' s total sales , which are primarily military-related . In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange , General Dynamics shares rose $1 , to $73. 875 . The write-off was announced after the market closed . General Dynamics purchased Cessna at a time when the entire general aviation industry was in a tailspin . Industry experts blame production overcapacity and a lag in the oil industry , which has traditionally been a major user of light aircraft , for a continuation of that slump . For the first nine months of 1986 , the general aviation industry recorded sales of $685 million , compared with $981 million in the year-earlier period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1981 shipped aircraft with a value of $2. 92 billion . Analysts and others had expected General Dynamics to provide Cessna with a big cash infusion , enabling the company to compete more effectively in the corporate aircraft area against major competitors such as Piper Aircraft , a unit of Lear Siegler Inc. , and Beech Aircraft , which is owned by Raytheon Corp . Instead , General Dynamics suspended production last May of Cessna ' s piston aircraft product line and reduced Cessna ' s work force by 2 , 500 , to 4 , 000 . " They bought it with their eyes open knowing the industry was in a power dive , but they thought it had long-term potential , " said Christopher Demisch , an aircraft industry analyst for First Boston Corp . Mr. Demisch said General Dynamics evidently underestimated the durability of the general aviation industry ' s slump.  --  - General Dynamics Division WASHINGTON  --  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration awarded an $11 million contract to a General Dynamics Corp. division to test and launch two Atlas/Centaur rockets from Cape Canaveral , Fla . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the San Diego-based Space Systems Division , will carry a Navy communications satellite .
