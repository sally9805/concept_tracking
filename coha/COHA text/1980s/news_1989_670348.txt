When Amy Wilentz first saw Haiti , its dictator was known by his schoolyard nickname , " Baskethead . " The White House announced one night that Baskethead had fled , but he was , in fact , playing ping-pong in the palace basement . He emerged to issue his memorable assurance that he was still in charge , " firm as a monkey ' s tail . " Every night there was gunfire in the capital . Rumors flew . The rich did cocaine in their villas . The poor maneuvered for sleeping space in their jammed shantytowns . Some families , for lack of beds , slept in shifts . Other poor , for want of space , slept erect . In Haiti ' s creole , Ms. Wilentz reports , there is a word for standup sleep . Baskethead , or , more formally , President-for-Life Jean-Claude Duvalier , eventually did flee , but that was only the beginning of a three-year adrenalin binge  --  a roller-coaster ride over coups , elections , strikes , demonstrations and bloodshed . Haiti ' s allure always has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to become a victim of the regime , " Ms. Wilentz says , " and that is why it is hard to fall asleep in Portau-Prince , and why everyone in Haiti is nervous : everyone is a potential victim . " Where else does a politician issue an explanation like this : " We can ' t just have all these bodies piling up and putrefying . This is a civilized country . " Along with such ironies and such evil , Ms. Wilentz quickly realized Haiti also is a mystery and , like all mysteries , fascinating . Haiti was on the boil , she writes , and she couldn ' t stay away . She quit her job and went to live there in the spring of 1987 . Ms. Wilentz , who has written for the Village Voice , The Nation and Newsday , had first visited Haiti in early 1986 on assignment for Time . In those days , there was reason to believe Haiti was about to take a turn for the better . This hemisphere ' s poorest nation ( Haiti runs neck-and-neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to throw off decades of oppression . Baskethead , the last of the Duvaliers , was on the ropes and Washington had switched from supporting Duvaliers to urging elections . Instead , the three years covered by " The Rainy Season : Haiti Since Duvalier " ( Simon &; Schuster , 408 pages , $19. 95 ) turned out to be only one more endless season in hell , leaving the island no closer to political stability , no more able to provide for its people , no surer of freedom from violence , but no less fascinating . Ms. Wilentz quickly establishes a distinctive voice , and a sharp eye for telling anecdotes . She begins with an almost fairy-tale-perfect story of one of Haiti ' s minor mysteries and petty corruptions . One day , a small plane for reasons unknown drops more than 100 bricklike packets of a translucent substance on a remote village . Surely , think the villagers , this is a sign . One villager discovers that the bricks can be ground into a white powder . He whitewashes his hut with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does their huts . Farmers try the powder as fertilizer , but it doesn ' t seem to work . In fact , some beans die . The local voodoo priest has a dream about the mystery , bets his dream number in the lottery and wins . He gathers the bricks and uses them in voodoo ceremonies . Finally , word of the bricks reaches men from the capital . They offer $13 a brick , a lot of money for a rural priest . The next day the street price of cocaine in the capital drops 50% . It is a quintessential Haitian tale . It is mysterious . It involves voodoo . The poor get cheated and the bad guys win . Ms. Wilentz sketches characters deftly . She also nicely plays down the considerable risks she took covering her story without hiding her moments of fear . She writes memorably of the horrors that befall the less lucky  --  Haiti ' s many victims . She makes no secret of her sympathies . Her heroes are found among the poor and in the liberation wing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orator and dedicated opponent of the ruling classes . Her villains are the rulers and their supporters , prominent among them , the U.S. Ms. Wilentz finds Washington too ready to work with Haitian strongmen who are devotedly pro-U . S. while brutalizing their people . In the early chapters her prose is often graceful and spare as when she describes this petty act of brutality by a lone thug : One of the hated Tonton Macoute gunmen grabs her hand to draw her into a dance . She pulls away , but seconds later a Haitian woman who also declines is brutally assaulted for her refusal . Then the Macoute , stick in hand , selects another girl from the crowd . He rests the stick against her cheek . Ms. Wilentz ends her vignette : " He began to dance . This girl danced . He smiled . " The later chapters seem more hurried , more bluntly written . Ms. Wilentz abandons spareness in her desire to tell all the twists and turns of her tumultuous story . Chapters are crammed with information , but too many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday ' s newspaper stories . Not that she isn ' t aware of the danger . Too many twists and turns , she knows , add up to nothing . She seeks to concentrate on those events that make a difference . " I wanted to remember things that would clear the confusion , " she writes . For the most part she has.  --  - Mr. Lescaze is the Journal ' s foreign editor.
