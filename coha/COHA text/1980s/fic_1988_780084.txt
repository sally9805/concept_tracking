 | " Jeez , they look like burnt toast . . . what coulda done it ? " Turner winced visibly . " Blowtorch maybe , you think ? " The local sheriff stuffed wind-chapped hands into his parka pockets to dig out battered gloves . Beneath them , snow squeaked as the men stuttered from booted foot to booted foot , tamping down the oncepristine surface . Besides Turner and the sheriff in his teddy-bear parka and flap-eared red-plaid wool cap that made him resemble a cartoon hound dog , five other men had gathered in the deep woods clearing . Six were out-of-state government troubleshooters with cold-rouged ears and noses . Then there were the two dead bodies sprawled across the hood of a heat-blistered government-issue Ford . Only months before , the automobile had left a plant assembly line painted a lackluster bottle-green ; now its husk was singed to the color of tobacco spit . " Burnt toast , " the sheriff mourned again , shaking his head . " Musta been some heat wave . " Turner looked away into the low steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers  --  swollen , split , char-broiled . They did n't look quite human , the bodies , Turner thought . His job came easier when the dead had the decency to look human . " Go right ahead and do your stuff , " the sheriff urged . " I like to see how the big-city boys do it . " The sheriff 's name was Leonard Kustovich . Turner knew  | his type  --  red-neck , blue-collar rube . This particular model was a third-generation Slav who should have been mining northern Minnesota 's Iron Range taconite strips like his immigrant ancestors . Instead , the world 's need for taconite had blown south down Highway 61 twenty-five years earlier , leaving with a harmonica-toting hitchhiker from Hibbing who called himself Bob Dylan . Now northern Minnesota beer joints thronged with unemployed men stewing in the stench of wet wool and sour expectations . Leonard Kustovich , being smarter than he looked , an advantage for a low-level public servant , had gotten a job as sheriff . " Do n't see much in the way of capital offenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team of technicians documenting the trampled snow around the burnt car . " Nothin ' that calls for six men . What department badge you flash again ? " Turner patiently tugged off his new wool-lined leather gloves and flashed a discreet identity card in a small , two-sided case . The brown leather cracked audibly in the subzero cold ; so did the brittle clear plastic entombing his name , rank and serial number . Goddamn world 's end of a place to end up in , Turner swore to himself , the only person he allowed to overhear his own profanity . Fucking foolish place to die in . To start a manhunt from , with a trail as cold as all outdoors . Kustovich 's seamed face waggled from side to side . " CIA . FBI . ATF . Now here 's the PID . Never heard of you guys . " " We like it that way . " Turner stared at the sky , a stonewashed denim expanse speared by dark , jousting pinetops . Along a route demarcated by fluorescent pink string , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the absence of it . Turner paced along the path , leaving behind two of his men , Kerr and Frakowski , but not the local sheriff . " You kin see they had some sort of oversized vehicle here . " Sheriff Kustovich 's heavy-duty gloves , the fingers thick and stiff as the dead men 's digits , traced a lopsided  | circle of footprints wading through the knee-high drifts . Nearby ran the deep parallel impressions of tire ruts . " Not equipped for back country snow , though . " " A van , " Turner said flatly . " Beige ' 78 Chevrolet . " " Those boys of yours we picked off the highway ravine last night ; they must be doin ' okay in the hospital , if they kin remember that . " " Not really . But they 're alive and probably 'll stay that way . Watch where you 're walking ! " " Hey , I know how to tippy-toe around a crime scene . " Kustovich twisted to survey the ruined car shrinking into a blot of black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brittle noonday sunlight . The tech team clicked and panned away , black boxes masking their faces . They did n't look quite human , Kustovich thought a little creepily , but then , neither did the dead men , and they were all stamped out from the same , government-issue cookie cutter . Where the long-gone van had paused , the trail lurched toward a dark fence of surrounding tree trunks . Footprints ? confused enough to indicate the coming and going of more than one person  --  pocked the snowdrifts . " Who are these fugitives , anyway ? " Kustovich probed . " Do n't tell me we got Russky spies slippin ' through the Mapleleaf Curtain ? Or ' Nam draft dodgers finally comin ' home ? Hey ! Undeclared aliens ? Drug smugglers , maybe ? " " Maybe . " Amusement crisped Turner 's cold-cracked lips . Time had taught him that denying local authorities the pleasure of speculation created more stir than letting them pursue any number of wild tangents . Kustovich eyed the city man , sizing him up as he himself had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off  --  Iron Range prejudices , but was n't half so dumb as he looked . Neither was the taut-lipped Turner . Mid-forties , without that beefy , hungry look you found among Iron Range men . Smooth in a way that did n't mean slick . Invisible . Except here . The sheriff let his bright brown eyes carom off the busy men  --  all duded up in their nylon-shelled this and downfilled that with nothing on their heads but what hair God 9 10 left ' em and with their exposed , note-taking , picture-taking hands turning lobster-scarlet in the icebox that was a Minnesota mid-January . Amateur experts , he scoffed to himself . Still , he followed Turner to trail 's end . At a clearing fenced by whip-thin brush , the footsteps ended in a cul-de-sac of drifts . " How many perpetrators , you figure , Mr. Turner ? " " Just . . . two . " " ? and whatever weapon fried those stiffs back there . " Turner winced without showing it this time . " And whatever . " " Musta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage . " " Maybe not . " Kustovich 's eyes narrowed hungrily , but Turner gave the sheriff his back as an aide plodded over for a whispered consultation . Kustovich , not one to hide his weaknesses , eavesdropped openly . " It 's a puzzler , sir , " the subordinate was saying . Kustovich envied that " sir . " " We knew that when we came up here , " Turner said . " I mean . . . this . These marks in the snow . " Turner and Kustovich looked where the man pointed . " Someone fell , " Turner dismissed the discovery . " Fell . . . maybe , sir . But why that ? That . . . blurring around the impact point ? It just grazes the snow 's surface at torso level but it 's deeper by the legs , like it was made deliberately . Weirdest thing I 've ever seen . " Turner would have answered , but Kustovich loosed a laugh reminiscent of a stalled snowmobile engine . As many big men do , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a show of it . " What 's so funny ? " Turner clipped out , annoyed at last . " Weird . ' Puzzler . ' Jesus H. Christ , where you boys come from originally , anyhow ? " Kustovich sputtered amiably . " My parents and Michigan , " Turner snapped . " Nevada , " said the other man . Kustovich 's ear-flapped head wagged roguishly . " Hell , I  | can see why a desert rat might be snowed by this , but a Michigan man . . . didn'cha ever play in the snow in Michigan , Mr. Turner ? " " Play ? " Turner 's enunciation made it evident that he never had played  --  then . . . or now . " Didn'cha kids make winter snow forts years ago ? Make icicles outa clothes poles by pouring water from the house down ' em ? Didn'cha drag your feet through clean-fallen snow and make big pie shapes to play tag in ? " Hell , there ai n't nothin ' weird about that mark ! It 's a snow angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here all the time , usually on the neighborhood lawns after a fresh fall . " " Snow angel ? " The underling from Nevada echoed Kustovich 's bizarre phrase when Turner would n't . " Snow angel . " Kustovich 's laugh subsided to a chuckle . " Lead me to a safe mussing spot and I 'll show yah how it 's done . " The Nevada man gestured him beyond the staked-out string . Turner followed . Before their eyes , Kustovich plopped ass-down in a virgin snowbank . He lay back in the bright white blanket of undented snow , chuckling with Santa-like glee , and began windmilling his arms and legs , sweeping them up and down , in and out , like a demented traffic cop . Neither watching face betrayed reaction , but the Nevada man finally let his jaw drop enough to speak . " That 's the same shape , all right . You mean somebody laid down there in the subzero temperatures in the dark last night  --  with two men fried a few yards away  --  and did that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the snow . " I do n't know , Junior , but I do know that this is how to make those marks . It 's a kid thing . It 's what you do when you 're nine years old and you ai n't got nothin ' else to do and the snow is pretty and you feel like thumbing your nose at the cold . They do it all the time , kids . Have for years . Give me a hand up ? Heck , if you do n't , I 'll ruin it , " the sheriff added plaintively . Kustovich extended big-gloved paws and waited .  | Turner and his associate froze for a disconcerted moment . Then each extended a gloved hand and levered the sheriff upright . He turned to admire his handiwork . " Not bad . Real nice , in fact . Have n't done that for  --  oh , shit . . . years . " He yanked off a mitt and began flicking snow clods from inside his collar . " Whew , snow on your neck sure is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these perpetrators would want to fry your guys , then stop to make a snow angel ? That 's what 's weird . What kind of hopheads we got here ? " " We ' have nothing here . The PID 's work is classified . " Turner moved back to the original snow angel . " Shoot it , close-up , " he ordered . Camera-bearers swarmed forward . A sudden scream whined into the clearing , rising and falling mechanically . One glaring red eye flickered through the black fence of bare tree trunks , following the now-deep tire tracks . Shutters clicked relentlessly as Turner walked away , Kustovich behind him . The ambulance 's white-painted sides looked dingy next to the fresh snow . The driver , alerted , had stopped well beyond the ropedoff area , but he left his emergency light on . It glinted hot pink through the snow flurries kissing past the charred car . Kustovich shivered in his warm winter woolens . " We do n't get many violent deaths up here , " he admitted . " Oh , we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasional kid who wanders off and falls through the river ice . We do n't even find that many dead rape victims . Too damn cold even for that . Now in one day I 've got three stiffs for young Doc Moudry . " " Three ? " For the first time that cold , clear noon Turner 's voice betrayed interest . " Three . " Kustovich ticked off the morning 's toll on his still-bare hand . " Your two here and that old lady found dead in her cabin . One of those north woods hermits . Probably croaked of a sick ticker . Old Lady Neumeier . Guess she used to be someone down in the Cities . Natural causes , though . Not like this . " Turner 's face pinched tighter . Together the two men  | watched as the scorched bodies were lifted from their grotesque positions and laid on stretchers in even more grotesque postures . For once Kustovich said nothing . The attendants slammed the ambulance doors shut , mounted the cab and whined away with their spinning red light faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clowns in some deep-freeze circus than angels of mercy . Angels . The word  --  and the recent demonstration ? made Turner 's face sour . God knew the dossier was slim enough  --  a sketch of the woman , a smattering of medical records . Of course , there was a lot more on the man . A whole lifetime 's worth to sift through and enlarge under the microscopic eye that PID was so expert at exercising . " A snow angel . " Beside Turner , Kustovich mused into the distance , chuckling mildly . " Do n't that beat everything ? Who 're you guys after , anyway , juvenile delin-quents ? " " You 're sure they fit ? " Kevin stared down at Jane 's brand-new boots with something resembling parental anxiety . Clumps of snow wedged under her heels were weeping onto the venerable wooden floorboards , but the boots were less than an hour old . Jane stared down , too . The boots were quilted nylon , down-filled mukluks , pale blue . Kevin supposed they looked stupid peeping out from under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he was n't a fashion expert . Neither was Jane . And the 13  | boots were warm . The saleswoman at the Midnight Loon , down the street , had assured him of that when he 'd ducked in solo to buy them . " I remembered your size from that day in the dormitory , " he told Jane , asking again , " They do fit ? " She nodded slowly , wearing the uncommitted dazed look she 'd hugged shield-close since the . . . the bluff top . But who could emerge from an encounter that traumatic without a little shell shock ? Not he , Kevin thought . He sighed and studied the relentlessly normal environs of an ersatz old-fashioned general store . Around Kevin and Jane browsers ambled down aisles arrayed with post-Christmas markdowns and winter gift paraphernalia , ranging from soft-sculpture mallards to plush polar bears and cow-eyed baby harp seals . Sporting goods bristled along every wall ; circular racks of winter outerwear formed islands in the stream of shoppers ; crockery beribboned like pampered pets anchored a gift alcove . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more than her big fur coat and brand-new boots  --  stood dripping onto the hardwood floor . The rural Minnesota town of Crow Wing counted on the tourist trade , even in the dead of winter . Shops like the Pine Cone lined a reclaimed Main Street to purvey trendy gewgaws to carloads of bored urbanites escaping the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul . " Oh , a sale . . . . " Jane 's dazed eyes focused expertly on a rack of skiwear . She headed for it with a gleam . Only Kevin 's quick hand on her arm delayed her . " No , no . Forget sales . ' Staying in Willhelm Hall made you into a coed clone . We do n't need that stuff . All we need is , uh ... " Kevin 's face absorbed some of Jane 's vacancy as he examined the consumer carousels around him . Nobody showed surprise at his bemusement , or noticed the mental fatigue graying his face . He knew he looked completely unremarkable , thank God , a prime example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  early  | thirties , clean-shaven , jeans-clad , confused . He could have been any typical husband or father out for a Sunday shopping spree , except that he was neither and he had never been typical . And Jane could have been ? He glanced at her and blanched . She was reaching out to finger a corduroy jacket sleeve , the damnable , inexpendable fur coat splitting slightly open on her torso ... . " Jesus Christ ! " Kevin 's hands jerked the coat edges shut . A woman shopper pawing through a rack behind Jane paused to lance him with a venomously reproving look . " You ca n't do that , " he added softly . " If you see something you like , point it out and I 'll pull it off the rack . " His crooked elbow soon bore a set of ladies ' thermal long johns , jeans , turtleneck sweater , wool plaid shirt , and gloves . All they needed now was the jacket . . . . He looked around . Jane 's dark head was disappearing among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He overtook her at a chrome carousel strung with Hudson Bay jackets , their characteristic red , green and yellow stripes screaming across the bland white wool fabric . " This , " suggested Jane . He smiled . " North woods to the zipper teeth , but .. . too distinctive . Wearing one of these lollipops would be even worse than this . " His hand tugged the sleeve of her fur coat . " But . . . I like it . " " It 's not right for where we 're going , " he insisted , gritting his teeth a little . Funny , he thought , how you never notice a headache until it 's ready to eat you alive . " It 's right for where we 've been ! " she argued . Kevin saw the glint of fine-edged anger sharpen her expression , and almost released his own exasperation . Once she 'd been infatuated with him and he had forced himself not to see it . He could have used a little dumb , unquestioning adoration now , when so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have celebrated any tiny sign of autonomy in Jane as a personal triumph . Now 15  | it had become simply inconvenient . Risking everything to ensure Jane 's independence , he now found himself the first to quash it . For her own good . Kevin 's free hand patted the front of Jane 's coat as if he stroked a living thing . " I know it 's tough to think of replacing . . . this , Jane , but we have to . " Jane 's rebellious expression softened as it met the concern in his eyes . Childlike , she bowed her head and pulled the coat open to examine it . Kevin glimpsed a hand'sbreadth of naked torso before he clamped the fur shut again . " Keep it that way , " he ordered , aware again of being an outsider in even the simplest matters . " We 'd better get you into the inside stuff . No regular underwear sold here , I 'm afraid , " he noted , shrugging by racks with Jane in his wake . " You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms were impossible to spot in the rambling storescape . Kevin corralled a woman clerk and dumped the clothes into her arms . " She " ? he nodded at Jane ? " wants to try these on . " The clerk weighed the comforting bulk of a multi-item sale on her forearm and quickly led them to the establishment 's rear , where tartan-plaid curtains masked two confessional-size dressing areas . Jane docilely ducked under the uplifted curtain , her expression puzzled . " Call me if you want anything , dear . " The clerk crimped a brisk smile at Kevin and bustled away . Kevin heard the mute motions of " trying on " behind the curtain . " If it fits , keep it on , " he hissed through the fabric , hoping Jane would know the correct order in which to install her new layered look . She was out in a few minutes  --  booted , blue-jeaned , sweatered and shirted from toes to chin . Kevin sighed real relief , his face losing five years of worry . Behind Jane in the tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built-in bench to slump onto the floor like a dead thing . Kevin collected the fur , then snagged a teal-colored down jacket for Jane on the way to the front cash register , 16  | and a cocoa-colored down jacket for himself . He began peeling hundred-dollar bills from his wallet , silently cursing the high denomination and Kandy 's eccentric money habits , handy as they sometimes were . " She 'll take it all , and wear it , " he told the clerk . " Have you got a bag for this ? " He hefted the full-length fur onto the countertop . Untidy iron-gray eyebrows visited the clerk 's receding hairline . " I 'll have to clip off the tags , sir , " she complained , advancing on Jane with a formidable pair of shears . " Fine ; no problem , " he said nervously , as much reassuring Jane as the clerk . Scissor blades flashed around Jane 's torso like a circus dagger-thrower 's knives . Strands of thin white plastic fishline popped every which way as Jane 's clothing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his booted foot from tapping the wooden floor as he and Jane dangled over the cash register for an eternity while the clerk computed each item . " Three hundred and four dollars and eighty-five cents , " she finally announced . " Great ! " The clerkish face expressed surprise . Kevin could have kicked himself for thinking only of the many small , useful bills he 'd get in change . Another mistake . Normal people do n't relish spending hundreds of dollars at a whack . He was n't going to be good at this , and he had to be . " I thought we 'd done more damage to the budget , " he backpedaled , joking . " But you ca n't get around in this weather without the right gear . " " Absolutely , sir , " trilled the clerk , carefully folding the fur coat into a large plastic bag into which it immediately and bonelessly collapsed . She wrung the bag 's neck and secured it with a plastic twist , then slung it over the counter . " A coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this 'll do until you folks get home again . " Home . The word hit Kevin in the sinuses right between the eyes , like Chinese mustard . Everything familiar dropped away . He felt the weight of the coat , shrouded in something that was first cousin to a 17  | garbage bag . He felt removed , as so many of his patients complained of feeling . He felt he stood on a hundred-yearold wooden floor that had turned into a hermit 's pillar in some alien wasteland too vast to sense . Something tugged at his arm . Jane 's hand . Her dark eyes pierced his emptiness . " I 'll take it , " she was saying , extending her other hand for the yellow sales slip and handful of bills the clerk was pushing at a momentarily nerveless Kevin . " We 've got a long way to go , " Jane added conversationally , apropos of nothing . And of everything . She turned and led him out of the store to a beige ' 78 Chevy van waiting by a meter that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial Main Street , where no one had to pay for parking . Nothing on earth approximated the silence of empty woods in winter . Nothing could be so vast and yet anonymous . Kevin crouched beside the conspiratorial snowdrifts behind the van 's rear bumper , pouring bottled spring water over the snow he had packed over the license plate . Cold had crippled his leather driving gloves into claws . He slapped at the snow and continued the ritual . This roadside baptism did n't confer an identity  --  hopefully , it would disguise one . And they would be coming , he knew that . They had to keep coming . It was their job . He looked up . Through the trees on his right , an occasional car hissed past on the plowed highway . This clearing that concealed the van while he performed his bizarre ablutions sat only fifty yards from Highway 61 outside of Crow Wing , Minnesota . Yet it seemed secure , probably because he wanted it to be . John Donne was wrong , Kevin mused bitterly . We are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jane was tramping around the clearing , her new boots driving footprints into the untouched snow , gloved hands swelling her jacket pockets , cheeks and nose rosy , thick dark hair riffling in the breeze . Kevin paused to watch , tenderness and fear weaving a  | saraband of frustration in his mind . He 'd seen something once in a book when he was a kid  --  a kid 's book  --  a painting of a small black pony against the snow , with a dark-haired girl in a muffler . And a small red apple offered across the blank canvas of the winter . Right now Jane looked like that child , although she was well into her twenties . She even looked like she should be playing , although she never had . " Done ? " she shouted across the clearing . He stopped himself from telling her to speak quietly and stood , dusting off cold-cracked leather palms . " Done . " " I like it here , " Jane said , lifting her head to a bloodless blue sky marbled with insipid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer through the drifts , his feet long since having become leaden ice lumps in his boots . " But we ca n't stay . " Jane 's eyes were level , very focused now . He shook his head . " Kevin , where are we going ? " " Awa " y ? " Away ? " she challenged . She had been challenging more lately . " Somewhere . " " Why ? " " Because . . . . " The reasons did n't belong in this firpillared nave of snow . He spread his stiff hands in a wordless gesture . She stared at him , into him , her eyes keener than kerosene . Then she mirrored his gesture , spreading her arms . Her lips parted with question and with cold , her eyes warming with intelligence , with understanding even . Kevin wanted to kiss her . Before he could move , Jane sat down in the snowbanks , sinking from view like a drowning woman . " That 's what you did , in the woods , " she said , laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark starfish beached on endless anonymity . Her arms and legs  --  tentatively , slowly  --  began moving up and down , in and out . As if she were leaping off the 19  | earth , or trying to . As if she were flying , or trying to . Around her , the snow shifted into the cookie cutter impression of an angel  --  a winged , full-skirted angel . A Christmas tree angel , as white and soft . . . and deadly . . . as fiberglass . " Get up , " Kevin said , his voice raw . " Get up ! " Bewildered , Jane stared at him , still smiling . " I saw you do it . In the woods . Last night . After . . . before . Why did you do it ? " " I  --  regression , I guess . Pointless regression . Get up . " He waded into the fragile construction , his feet blurring its outlines , and pulled her up . His gloves beat lumps of snow off her back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kevin , why ? ? " " Jane ? " No more words came , just the name  --  the pseudonym  --  that they had both paid such an unfathomable price to retain . Kevin enfolded her in a bearish embrace , his cheek pressing the cold softness of hers . It felt strange without the barrier of his beard between them . He missed it . Damn .. . needed to shave again . Did n't want to look like a vagrant , attract attention . Already he was tiring of the rules of the game , and it had just begun ... . " I do n't know where to go , " he confessed , more to himself than to her . He still viewed Jane as his charge  --  his precious , dangerous , two-edged charge . " I do n't know where to take you . I only know that I have to do one thing at a time . " He broke their embrace to look back at the van , sitting bland and innocent in the snow . " The license plates are taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's enough . Those flashy C-notes of Kandy 's have probably alerted every state trooper on Highway 61 by now . Or maybe they have to keep quiet about this . Maybe their hands are tied , too . " " Kevin , who ? The men who followed us on the highway , the men in the woods who ? ? " She stopped , frowned , and looked into herself . Kevin 's rough gloves wrenched her naked face to his and kissed it away  --  the frown , the memory . Most of all the  | memory . Not many days before , his job  --  his only passion ? had been helping Jane to remember . She kissed him back with an ardor that always surprised him . He relaxed into that small inlet of warmth in this large ocean of cold called a world . " We 've got to keep moving , " he said when their faces separated . Their breaths mingled into phantasmagoric traceries of vanishing frost . " Come on , we 've got to dump the coat . " He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps . Jane floundered behind him , gamboling like a pony . Her eyes brimmed curiosity as he pulled the yellow plastic bag from the back of the van , heaved it over his shoulder Santa-wise and forged across virgin snow to a ring of towering pine trees . And like a dog , Jane tilted her head to watch as Kevin laid down the burden , then studied the area . " Where , do you think ? A good , out-of-the-way spot , " he consulted her , trying to give her a role in their melodrama . She looked around , then leveled her finger at a top-lofty , emerald-black fir tree . Kevin grinned . " You do n't have to keep pointing . Your coat 's not going to fall open and reveal the Sally Rand of the Iron Range anymore . Okay , the tree it is . There 's a good-size drift there anyway . Very Freudian , you know , to choose a fir ' tree . " He crouched at the tree trunk , crouched and began pawing at the hip-high mound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laughing , snow spraying from her gloved hands , stars of glitter tangling in her eyelashes , her cheeks and lips red , red , and the snow so white , so light , so fresh , so cold . " That 's enough . " Kevin sat back on his heels and slung the bag into the snowpit they 'd made . Jane 's face stiffened as she finally realized what he was doing . He gave her a quick smile before pushing snow over the plastic , burying it in soft , silent handfuls . It was quiet in the woods . And empty . Then Jane spoke . " Zyunsinth , " she 21  | Her eyes stared at the rumpled snow , and the crumpled plastic bag half-buried by it . " Zyunsinth , " she repeated , on a rising note of denial . " Yes , I know , but it 's . . . it 's a dead giveaway , Jane . It 's too easy to trace , an expensive , eye-catching coat like that . We ca n't afford to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving . . . Zyunsinth here ? " " I have to . Jane ? " She hurled herself atop the sack , burrowed herself into the snow with it , her gloves tearing uselessly at the plastic . She wrenched them off and her bare fingers poked ragged holes in the material . Patches of fur pushed out . Jane 's palms petted them feverishly while Kevin tried to stop her . " Jane , we have to leave the coat ! It 's a hazard . " They tussled through his words . It was like interning at the state hospital again , Kevin thought , agrip with deja vu . Like trying to subdue a schizophrenic . But he knew how to exert force in a crisis . " It can hurt us , hurt you , " he panted between efforts to confine her awesome energy . " I know how attached you are to the damn thing , but ? " Her eyes grew leaden with loss . She lay still under him at last , like a victim , her hair in her teeth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinned to the death-pale earth . Kevin shut his eyes and released her . When he looked again , she had sat up and was wiping a stream of tears from her face with icy palms . The tears frightened him more than the fury . He had never seen Jane cry before . Never . " Jane . . . . " His hand did n't quite connect with any part of her , but hovered  --  nearby and irretrievably distant . " Zyunsinth , " she mourned , rocking . " I know I ca n't begin to understand what . . . it . . . they ... mean to you , " he began , fighting for the cool control of a therapy session , fighting to become again the iceman in the white lab coat , if he had ever been that . Her hands , twining , covered each other on her mouth . Her eyes were holes in the snow all around them , deep and dark . " Home , " she said . He was silent .  | Jane sat back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminding him of springwater icing a license plate . Kevin wanted to wipe them away and strip her of obscurity . Instead , he must act against his instincts , his profession , his ethics even . He had to help her to hide , even from herself , no matter what . He turned and began piling snow atop the fur coat , speaking over his shoulder to her , to himself . She did n't try to stop him anymore . " Your home is here , Jane , " he said , hoping he would believe it , too . " With me . We 're only . . . burying .. . Zyunsinth . See , you even picked a good tall tree to tell the site by . Maybe  --  someday  --  we can come back and . . . dig it up . When winter 's over and everything 's all right . Someday . " He wished he did n't sound as if he were speaking to a child . God knew she was n't that . He wished he did n't sound as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't afford to . " Come back . " Jane 's eyes lightened . She watched the bag disappear under his tireless hands . " Someday . Yes , I think so . Someday they will come back . " He stared at her , inferring her meaning , chilled by the obvious truth of it , frozen for the moment beyond snow and pain . " He 's our best lead . " Turner threw a photograph of a bearded man to the Formica desktop . It was one of those bland , smiling black-and-whites used in professional journals . " It 's the woman we want , " Lindahl said , swiveling to study a gray January day . The office window was still 23  | dust-streaked with the past autumn 's crop of falling leaves and rain . Turner threw another image atop the man 's  --  the penand-ink sketch of an unsmiling female face . " We 've got nothing in her file but this , and some medical reports . Blake 's notes are nonexistent , or hidden or destroyed , though I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Turner hesitated and twisted in his chair . Here in the Cities he wore a suit and a warm , inner-lined London Fog . Somehow , after the expedition north and what they had found  --  and lost  --  his city slicker garb rubbed him the wrong way . " Oh , he 's smart enough , " Turner answered . " Harvard Med School , all those headline-grabbing cases . No , Dr. Blake is smart enough . He just is n't sneaky enough . " " He was sneaky enough to elude you in Duluth and evade your two men on the highway . To . . . incinerate two more . " Turner shook a weary head . " It does n't track , Karl . I do n't know the first who , what , why  --  or even how  --  on those deaths up there . " " We 've got an all-points out on the van ? " " Sure . But we ca n't alert the locals to our interest , so it 's just a phony moving violation offense we pumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll stop it . If they 're looking hard enough . No , our best bet is still the people , not the vehicle . " Lindahl spun back , all bureaucratic melodrama , to face Turner . " Find them . Washington wants them bad . " " Washington . " Turner came as close to swearing as he allowed himself . " Why ? All we 've got here is a rogue shrink and his patient on the run  --  and some rumored psi abilities that may not pan out . Why the federal case ? " " That 's for me to know and you to not know . " " Okay . Fine . Pull all that upper-level clearance . . . " If he 'd been about to say " crap , " he did n't give Lindahl the satisfaction . " . . . mumbo jumbo on me . You know those security levels exist mainly to give a bunch of bureaucrats a sense of self-importance . You spy guys would be  | nowhere without domestic operatives like me who know our turf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's too broad and too cold . You ca n't expect me to hunt blind . " " Sure I can , " Lindahl said . " But what do you have in mind ? " " You ever see an old Hitchcock movie , To Catch a Thief ? " " Sure . . . I get it ? " " To catch a shrink , use a shrink to find him . " Lindahl picked up the industrial-strength stapler on his desk . " You 're thinking of Nordstrom . " Turner nodded . " He 's been . . . useful , but ? " " He 's a . . . " ? Turner mentally deleted an expletive ; it was a game he played , avoiding the obvious ? " a cold fish , " he finished forcefully . " But we can use him . " " I wish we had more on her . " Lindahl indicated the sketch . " We will . " Turner rose and pulled his all-weather coat off the rack . " When we get him . " Lindahl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sound and frustration connecting nothing . Outside , Turner paused to examine Fourth Street traffic . A day as innocuously gray as the granite five-story federal building itself swathed downtown Minneapolis . Two blocks down the street loomed the Victorian bulk of the Hennepin County Courthouse , its copper-roofed turrets poking green spearheads into the ragged winter clouds . Dirty snowbanks hunched along the hidden curbs , thrown there by city plows after every snowfall worth calling that . Passersby minced along the icy sidewalks , heads lowered to shelter their faces from the chapping wind . Turner kept his head erect as he walked to the dingy parking garage where his government-issue car sat on an upper level brutally open to the wind . It would be cold , but he was used to this godforsaken climate . Vaguely distasteful assignments , like tracking naive psychiatrists and their patients , were nothing new , either . 25  | Neither were distasteful deaths . Before this case was over , there would probably be more of them , Turner told himself . Monica Chapman shifted slightly on the austere black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellis wool skirt wrinkle-free beneath her . She heard the tap of his Mark Cross pen against the spiral binding of his leatherbound yellow legal pad and froze . He watched everything . And he always occupied the traditional Freudian position behind her . Out of sight . Invisible but all-seeing . Like God . Monica Chapman had long since stopped believing in God . Instead , she believed in  --  feared  --  her psychiatrist . ( " For I am a jealous god and you will put no graven images before me .... ' ) " You 're fidgeting , Monica . A bad sign . Are you considering lying to me again ? " His disembodied voice was low , resonant , baritone enough for a disc jockey and oily enough for a spa salesman . She kept her eyes on all she could see from her supine point of view , on all he let her  --  or any other patient  --  see . There was a wall of soberly framed degrees attesting to his credentials in semi-illegible hand-lettering ; bookcases furnished in suites of identically bound volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disinformation ; the expensive German tape recording system with its showy , slow-motion oversized reels , so the patient was exquisitely aware of every word being engraved in its original tone for instant replay , again and again . Why , why was she here ? Why did it seem so impossible not to be here ? The thoughts sank into a familiar track like a needle into an LP groove . Monica hardly felt the pain now , although she knew it must hurt  --  somewhere . She forced herself to look at things again , not thoughts . Things . There was one framed photograph on the wall  --  black and white  --  of a ballerina . Gelsey Kirkland in Swan Lake , Monica thought , although she had never asked and he had 26  | never said . Frozen , the tulle-dolloped figure looked brittle and puppetlike , not human at all . Monica ruminated on the fact that Degas , the exquisite chronicler of the danseuse 's fragile ultrafeminine beauty , had hated women . " You always fixate on my little dancer , Monica , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to irritate him , Monica lied , knowing it even as the word left her lips . " . . . beautiful . " " Yes . And you 're envious . " Her long body in the designer suit jolted on the couch as if electroshocked ever so slightly . In the ensuing pause , Monica read his satisfaction at striking a nerve so soon in session . She would have glanced at the slim gold watch on her equally slim wristbone , but knew from experience that any sign of restiveness irritated him , made him . . . more demanding . " I 'm not envious ? " she began . " Of course you are . You know your self-hatred manifests itself in your drive to succeed in your career . And the more successful you are , the more you loathe yourself . And then you gorge  --  secretly , in your chic , narrow esophagus of an alley kitchen with all those stainless steel gadgets . " Such things you gorge on , dear Monica , so tacky . Fish and chips , ice cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from some SoHo specialty shop , but common supermarket lard . You make quite a pig of yourself , Monica , in that high-rent apartment of yours . And then you come to me . For absolution . " She writhed under his expertly applied words , and ran her fingers nervously under the Perry Ellis waistband . Size six and already loosening . . . . It was n't fair ! She tried and tried until she was so tired and confused , until only an act of excess here , another there , would calm her , would ease the eternal inner ache . " I wo n't describe how disgustingly you neutralize your excesses , " he continued . " You would have made a fine Roman empress , Monica , purple-draped like some mountain grape , lying on your cushioned couch , waiting to have whole banquets delivered by some slave 's hand to your lascivious little mouth . Pheasant . . . gravies by the tureen 27  | ... rich , thick puddings from ewers , all down , down your ravenous aristocratic maw . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another slave would tickle your throat with the feather of a fresh-slaughtered emu and yet another slave would hold the golden bowl while you ? " " No , please ! " Her throat was dry , raw , as if she 'd been retching for hours . " Instead you have your career and your privacy . Such has modern-day culture brought us . You have a white porcelain bowl to embrace  --  oh , pardon ; I believe you told me your master bathroom has maroon fixtures . How decadent , Monica . How Roman of you . " " It 's a disease , " she said anxiously . " Bulimia is a disease . " " A most fashionable disease . " " And maybe I . . . retch . . . because of what my father and brothers did to me . I used to . . . throw up . . . every time , when they were done with me . " " But you stayed at home until you were eighteen . Why , Monica ? You could have left , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But the accusation , like thousands of accusations rendered before : You always . . . you must . . . you need ... you asked for it , drummed into her head until the voices echoed there of their own volition , accusing , accusing , until she would have crawled over shattered Baccarat to silence them . " No one would have wanted me , " she muttered , " helped me . " " But I 'm here now . To help you . You know you depend on me now . Monica , stand up . " She stiffened . " I want to look at you . " " I have n't cheated ! I did n't gorge all last week , honest , I did n't  --  well , only once , maybe , and then only on half a bag of Pecan Sandies . Please , Doctor , please . " " I must see you . Stand up . Now ! " Her slim calves slid together off the couch . Charles Jourdan heels hit the Berber carpeting in unison . Monica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of open vertical blinds upper Manhattan drifted on the gray residue of a January afternoon . She stood without making him say it again . It always took her breath away , facing him for the first time after the ceremony of the couch . He was such a little man , in his gray Brooks Brothers suit , gray like the day . He always seemed so much bigger than he looked . Now he looked at her , through the rimless spectacles , studying her designer ensemble with perfect appreciation , although he himself could have been mistaken for an expensively clad ragpicker on the street . He had no style . Monica did n't know what he saw , through those watery eyes of no color , through those thick glasses that refracted his expression into blank judgment . She had no image of herself at all . Except naked . " No , " she begged , her hands beginning to shake . " Have you gained weight this week , Monica , is that it ? " " No ! " she denied , telling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still glimpse it . She frowned her sudden confusion . " And I 'm supposed to gain weight  --  the doctors say so . " But you never do what you 're supposed to . " His voice , so in control , lowered and began to shake itself , with anger . " Take your clothes off , you silly cow , so I can see what a pig you 've made of yourself . " " Can you . . . draw the blinds ? " " This is the fifty-ninth floor , Monica , " he jeered openly , his voice lashing her , joining the voices in her head bursting into a chant of abuse . " No one can see you . No one would want to see you . Except me . Strip , you stupid bitch ! " Her hands jerked to the buttons of her jacket , her blouse . The supple , hundred-percent natural fabrics separated from each other with luxurious ease . Monica Chapman had not had a lover since . . . oh , years before , when she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought like candy , or pursued like a degree , or earned like a promotion , or deserved like love . 29  | All she had now was this , her psychiatrist , sitting there clothed and powerful , forcing her in ways even her brothers had not thought of . A dull spark of resistance flared from time to time in her brain , but the chorus in her head surged into a baroque mass of denial , and her own lone soprano always joined their blistering rhapsody of denigration . " You love it , " her psychiatrist said now , his baritone blending with the plainsong of her psyche . " Secret shame and guilt , my shabby empress , are your kingdom . " Her clothing lay at her feet , the peach silk French lingerie petaling around her ankles with her expensive panty hose . If he had looked at her with lust , even the most cartoonish leer , it would n't have been so bad . His eyes held only contempt . He got up and walked to his desk where the cold white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half-inch slab of crystal that shone green along the edge . He swept the few items atop the desk aside and gestured to its glittering empty surface , so like his eyes . " Come here . I want to play the Game today . " She shivered , a painfully thin naked woman with painfully naked eyes . " It 's so cold , " she protested , one last excuse for a life that itself seemed to have no excuse . " You 'll get used to it , " he promised carelessly . " Have n't I proved again and again that you can get used to any-thing ? "  | They slept beside each other fully dressed , like Hansel and Gretel in the woods . Maybe part of that was Kevin 's fear that they might have to move fast , have to flee the dinky motel outside the dinky town on the badly plowed county road . Maybe it was part shyness , the awkwardness of the new selves he and Jane presented each other , dressed so atypically . Maybe it was partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P.M. Most of it was the cold . Despite the heating unit 's hissing bravado , nothing much resembling warmth seeped across the mean indoor-outdoor carpeting to the old-fashioned double bed they lay in . Jane had pressed herself into Kevin , showing a new dependence since the loss of Zyunsinth . He could n't complain . Who , he had often thought , wants to compete with a satin-lined length of dead mammal skins ? He held Jane 's sleeping form , feeling her breath collect against his chest and gradually swathe his naked throat with welcome warmth , and told himself that this was the woman he loved . She was and he did , but it was n't as simple as that , if it had ever been as simple as that . Why her ? Why him ? Why could n't they be back at the University of Minnesota Hospitals , in his homely little office , playing doctor and patient , shrink and shrinkee ? The campus would look desolate now , on the dirty selvage edge of winter , but students would bustle between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ice-caught river would look like a faraway road through the stark trees ... . Bridget would brew her morning coffee strong for the Probe crew , then spike it with the Irish tease in her voice when Kevin passed her desk . Norbert Cross would hem and haw and crack the whip at the daily meetings , and Roger Matthews would evade and Carolyn Swanson would be her priggish , academic self and , God , he missed the security of everything he had once felt so free to despise ... . Jane burrowed against him , murmured . " How can I love you ? " he asked rhetorically . " I do n't know you . You have no history ; you do n't even have a pretense of personality . You 're an enigma , an empty slate , an experimental memory blank ? " She murmured again in her sleep . For lost Zyunsinth ? Kevin clutched her closer . Jane murmuring , Jane burrowing , Jane acting downright human . Was that what he wanted , wanted to love ? Was that Jane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not even a phone occupied the nightstand . Kevin had never traveled in such shabby circles , had never shorn himself so free of normal society . If he shifted to pull up his wrist and read the time on his solid gold Swiss watch  --  talk about something telltale he should have buried with Zyunsinth  --  he might wake Jane . While he debated , she woke anyway . There was no preliminary , no words , just her fingers pushing his clothes aside searching for his skin , her warm lips seeking the chill of his . Desire flared so suddenly that they both grappled like desperate teenagers overcoming a bundling board , exposing each other to the cold in inches . Another man might have wondered if she 'd been dreaming and wakened to take him in someone else 's stead . Kevin had the luxury of knowing he was the first and only man to love her , for all her hungry skill . That ironclad certainty alone made a potent aphrodisiac , a love  | potion , even in an icy motel room in Waukenabo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making love with Jane usually evolved into a menage a trois , the everpresent ghost of his guilt joining in . Kevin had always been an ethically vainglorious shrink ; he despised doctors who , sworn to help , exploited a patient 's vulnerability . That Jane was not victim , but partner ; that he had fallen victim to love , not lust  --  the love he had admitted to a distraught Jane on the incriminating tape Dr. Cross had held over him  --  made it even worse . The only thing that pains a shrink more than being caught with your professional pants down is being nailed with your own renegade emotions in plain view . Jane sensed his reticence and pulled him into the vortex of her urgency , the ebb and flow of her hands , mouth , body spinning him into co-conspiracy . Beyond her erotic motions he sensed the deeper , darker shadow dancers of her emotions  --  her isolation , her unique oneness . He felt again  --  for her  --  the Volkers ' bruising rejection , the cold , dreary days of flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Compassion flared into fresh passion . Their flesh warmed in conjunction . Feeling became incarnate . Penetration was his surrender , not hers . He moved into her , with her , forgetting everything , especially his regrets , his damnable responsibility . Jane came first , stiffening in that stillness before the storm , then quivering her fulfillment . Despite the sexual high , Kevin could n't stop himself from withdrawing before his own orgasm spilled into the funnel of her vagina . He was an M.D. , for God 's sake ; he knew such precautions were feeble protection . He denied himself anyway , letting the act 's thunder dwindle and pulse away . He felt green and foolish , and guilty again . Jane moaned sleepy satisfaction and drifted away , whispering his name , not Zyunsinth 's . In aftermath , love built its own irrational 33  | erection within him . Whatever she was , whatever he was ? and he was beginning to wonder  --  Kevin knew they belonged together . He forced himself through a relaxation exercise , made his jumping skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kevin drifted in the tingling , disconnected state between sleep and consciousness . Suddenly , he knew what he would do . The psychiatrist in him had surfaced again . Tomorrow , when the sun rose and after they 'd breakfasted at some hick coffee shop on some anonymous Main Street and he 'd bought some fucking contraceptives in some faceless K-Mart corner , he 'd take Jane home . " Lost ? Is this certain ? " " Unable to contact , certainly . " " But the control ? " " Dis . . . abled . " " Destroyed ? " " Dis . . . engaged . " " For what reason ? " " An . . . experiment . " Jane dreamed , hearing voices . Jane dreamed , not of other men , but of those other than men  --  or women , other than mankind , than humankind , than human . The susurration lulled her  --  the " esses " of their speech . It was sound and pause between . Rasp and click , roll and hiss . She received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow of the sounds . " Losssst . **25;728;TOOLONG . Dissssssss .. . Disabled . Destroyed . Disengaged . Dissssssssssssss . . . exxxxssss . Experiment . " The words hummed down her veins , sparked from cell to cell , nucleus to nucleus . She heard them , saw them , smelled them , felt them . . . words throbbing through her with an almost sexual sense of possession . Posssesssssion . Esses ,  | exes , excuses , experiments . Esss . Ssssss . Hissing in the corner , under the window . She sat up in the dark . The machine across the room hissed icily at her . Beside her , Kevin slept . She looked down at him , on his night-hidden features that she saw anyway in her indelible mind 's eye . She touched the fingers of one hand to his face , feeling the roughness of his skin where new beard was trying to outgrow the scythe of his morning razor blade . His skin was cold and the heating unit hissed and something in her hurt . Not her head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her empty vagina . She knew words . There had been words within her , to begin with , and then she had scanned the big , too-heavy book in the university and all the words in the world had rushed into her . Why should these most recent words , overheard in her own head , discomfort her ? She almost asked Kevin . She was used to asking Kevin , and he was nearby , which made her happy , which was a word she had never truly understood before . There were many such words , she sensed , and they made her afraid ? another newly felt word . But she paused . His cheek was warming to the presence of her fingertips . He was rough and quick and bewildering and so , so . . . separate . But he was sleeping and he did n't hear the hissing , as she did , and he would worry if he did . Or knew that she did . Her fingers slipped away and she lay down , listening and trying not to listen . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awareness , endlessly gossiping . " The over-others may disagree . " " It is small , this place . The unit can be traced and disconnected permanently . " " Obviously . But now there is no means of gleaning . " " Other means , like means , if they are used . " " Who gives the instructions ? " All or none . It is the purpose . " " It is the necessity . " 35  | Incessant . Purpose . Necessity . Incessantly . If she was careful , and concentrated in strange , hidden ways , she could mute the sounds that surged through her . She let them ebb to a barely perceptible rasp along the pathways of her nerves . By the window , the heating unit expelled a sputtered arpeggio , shaking her solitude . Jane turned her head to locate its featureless bulk against the faint light . Her calming ritual ran liquid through her , antennae of sensation feeling their way in the dark . Jane 's breath , misting in the icy room , sent tentative tendrils to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasflame in the dull light , then fisted and wrenched the heat control off . The hissing died abruptly , within her and outside her , at once . The room grew colder in almost discernible stages from second to second . Jane curled herself into the curve of Kevin and forgot it all . He lay awake on the black leather couch and dreamed . He always scheduled Monica Chapman as the day 's last patient , so twilight was darkening his office as Manhattan 's firmament of sky-high windows slowly sparkled into overtime life . He let himself do what he seldom allowed his patients to do  --  relax on the psychiatric couch . The layman equated black leather with male potency , but he , being a psychiatrist , knew better . It represented female skin , the smoothness , the smell . Men liked it because it broadcast their masculine wants to the world ; women because it attracted men . He had always been attracted to other . . . things . He let his eyes focus on the stark black-and-white photograph of the dancer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planes , into her attenuated neck , into the delicate ladder of chest bones descending from the sharp horizon of her collarbones to 36  | the decolletage of her costume where no breasts overflowed . His breath caught at the splendid flatness of her form . Last , he fondly studied the fine shadow lines from elbow to wrist , ankle to knee , his perusal stripping her to the bones beneath the barely intervening skin . Finally he sighed and let himself picture Monica Chapman naked . He mentally tallied her ribs , dwelled on the hollows of her hipbones , the bony geography of her knees and feet , hands and elbows . Almost enough for him , almost enough to assuage that bottomless gnaw that no analysis no matter how deep could reach . It amused him to flirt with her chronic bulimia , lashing her into spasms of starvation , then flogging her into a more proper frame of mind only to unleash her abysmal lack of self-esteem and let her demons consume her for a time . He hated her sick complicity , and the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she had her points ; she was far , far too maladjusted to break free , to report him . And he kept her on the razor 's edge of survival until she had come to expect it . Best of all was the complete submissive starvation in her eyes  --  that burning hopelessness , that numb painfulness that made her so vulnerable to his rather . . . unique . . . needs . She was a good patient . He came again , simply from dwelling on the ballerina 's distance , on Monica Chapman 's helplessness . It always helped , that removal from the source , the stimulus . He needed to fuck from afar , by proxy . His semen spurted neatly into one of the large white Irish linen handkerchiefs he ordered by the box from an exclusive men 's shop on 57th Street . His initials occupied one corner . He would never taint his pleasure by emptying it into the charnel house of a woman 's body . Not now . He needed something else , he finally admitted in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind , a job with no limits , something that would allow him to dig his fingers into the human psyche and knead it like the malleable dough it was .  | The pressure was tightening around his skull , sucking him into the black hole that was the eye of his emotions . He knew he was sick . He knew he was dangerous . He needed to know that those attributes were needed  --  somewhere . The phone rang and he turned his head slowly to it . His rimless glasses winked soberly in the twilight . He needed a new assignment . Dirty winter roads unraveled beneath the van 's balding tires . Let them trace these tracks , Kevin thought . Sometimes the greatest safety can be found in a lack of safety . Beside him in the van 's passenger seat , Jane hummed unmelodiously , as if eavesdropping on an atonal cosmic radio . " Does home ' mean those people ? " she asked out of nowhere . " They 're called parents , " he answered dryly . " You said they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was wrong . Do n't look so surprised . The great Dr. Blake can be wrong . Look , I wanted to reject the Volkers even more than you did . They were interfering with my tidy little scenario for self-interest and your .. . independence . We were kinda rough on them , you and I. I knew you were more than just another amnesia patient , another Jane Doe for the newspapers to cluck over , but I did n't even begin to guess what you really were then ? " He saw anxieties rising in Jane 's eyes that he was n't ready to assuage . He cupped her face in the quieting warmth of his palm .  | " I only knew that you were . . . special , " he soothed . " Unique . I tried to deny any ordinary claims that had a right to you . Like parents , if their claims are ever ordinary . I was wrong . Do n't you want to know how you came to be , Jane ? Where exactly . . . you came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bluff top this last time ? Or the first , for that matter . You came into our world naked , do you want to live in it that way ? Surely your amnesia must be ebbing a little now . Do n't you remember anything of . . . them ? " Jane 's face wrenched from his hand . She was staring out the window , but fields of white snow refused to mirror her reflection . In the sideview mirror , Kevin glimpsed only the tips of her eyelashes and a slice of uncompromising cheekbone . " I remember . . . being brought to the hospital in the screaming ecnalubma . I remember you stopping by my room the first time  --  a little . And then I remember our sessions  --  everything about our sessions , about living with the student nurses in the dorm with Mrs. Bellingham . I remember you holding me . And I remember . . . the Volkers , coming and wanting to take me away , saying they 'd seen my picture in the paper and that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They were .. . silly . " Kevin paused . " And you are still mired in adolescence . Cruel Jane . You can blow parents away with one word more effectively than any rebellious teenage punker safetypinned from earlobe to belly button . " " You 're angry with me ? " Anxiety edged into her tone . " That goes with the territory sometimes . With being human , " he added with deliberate provocation . She ignored his challenge . " I will . . . try to like them , " she resolved fiercely , her hands fisting in her lap . " Do you like anybody ? " he asked , amused . Startled , she considered . " No . " " Not even me ? " The length of her slow sum-uppance was disconcerting .  | On occasion , Jane acted like an idiot savant  --  blissfully brilliant and aggravatingly dense . " Sometimes I even dislike you , " she confessed . " You can still like me in-between . " " No . I love you in-between . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he " liked " Jane , if it was possible to like anyone as unformed and yet inherently and totally herself as Jane . " You 're sure they are my parents ? " She sounded anxious again . " Biologically , yes . " " Before , you proved that they were n't and they went away . " " Yes . " She considered . " Everyone thought you were smart . " " I am . Too smart . " " What about her ? " " Who ? " " The . . . other one they found . Like me . Only dead . " For a moment he was lost . " My God , did you hear about that ? I did n't know you knew the details . She was your .. . sister , I guess . That 's where we all went wrong . We thought that you had to be the girl your parents raised , Lynn Volker , and that she had to be you . If Lynn Volker was proven dead beyond a doubt , you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of you , products of the same ovum and semen , the same cell , maybe . So the Volkers did n't raise you , but they 're still your parents . Your biological parents . " " And I am a clone . " " What ? " " You called me a coed clone ' in the store . I know what coed means and I know what clone means . You think because I have not lived a word that I do n't understand it . " His hands hit the steering wheel . " That was a figure of speech . I do n't know for sure how or why ? " " I was only gleaning efficiently ! " she flared . Tears brightened her eyes . Gleaning . The word pinged alarm in his mind , as surely 40  | as Zyunsinth did . Jane had used it repeatedly under hypnosis when he 'd tried to unearth the secrets of her forgotten past . His voice grew professional , which was to say , calm , interested and nonjudgmental . " When were you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is vital to glean efficiently  --  and , and all the girls in the dorm took pride in getting their clothes on sale ? " " The nurses in the dorm are twits ! " he exploded . " Look , shopping is the opiate of the masses . It 's a shallow , unimportant pastime meant to turn women into consummate consumers to fuel our incestuous national economy . Buying things on sale ' is an illusion , the act of wringing value from a valueless pursuit . It does n't really matter . " Jane was silent . " Perhaps it did once , " she answered finally . " You took me to the big store downtown to shop , the place where I gleaned . . . " Her voice wavered . " . . . Zyunsinth . And now you said we needed new clothes after the light burned everything but Zyunsinth away . I do n't understand . " " I just do n't want you picking up the wrong values . Buying things for necessity 's sake is different from buying them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , choose things . That they should reflect the I-ness of me . " " Ye-es . . . . " She had him . " But that was during your imitative stage . God , Jane . I do n't know how to help you understand this crazy world of ours . " " Before , you said I was right to say the Volkers were nothing to do with me . Now you say ? " " I know , I know ! I 'm inconsistent . Now I think you might need  --  want  --  to know that someone , somewhere here on earth , has a legitimate claim on you . Besides the . . . " He sighed . " . . . the others . " She did n't answer . She did n't want to remember them any more than he did . That was why he had to pick at the memory still oozing beneath the scab . " Jane , what do you remember of the bluff top when the light came down ? "  | " Brightness . Lightness . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snow . You . . . as far away and small as a snowflake . Many snowflakes of light . Cold , then heat , then nothing . And , and . . . being drawn within , my insides being pulled further inside . With . . . them . " " Do you remember them at all ? " Her head shook , violently . Jane suddenly scooted toward him , leaning across the dirty-floored gulf between their seats , her hands clutching his arm , her face buried in his sleeve . " I believe it now . They are my parents . The Volkers . Kevin says so . I want . . . to see them again . I want to remember them . . . me . Please , Kevin , I must see the Volkers ! " " You will , " he promised , fighting to keep the van from swerving at her tug on his arm . Already the roadside signs had reduced the speed limit from fifty-five miles per hour to forty . He meticulously slowed the van to legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home of Adelle and Jack Volker loomed in the late-afternoon grayness . The last  --  and first  --  time Kevin had driven these unassuming streets he had come clutching at a straw . Now he clutched the needle in the haystack in his hand , and only needed to locate the right thread . Maybe it would be the Volkers , he hoped , stopping the van in front of their simple frame house . The street was quiet , deserted . Jane accompanied him up the walk with excited dread , fidgeting like a schoolgirl about to confront the couple who had accused her of stealing apples . Volker himself answered the doorbell , looking lumberjack-solid in his plaid shirt . After flaring in surprise , his eyes grew relentlessly neutral , even when they rested on Jane . " What are you doing here again , Dr. Blake ? " he asked flatly . " She wanted to come . " " She did ? " Volker acted as if Jane were invisible . " Did n't want much to do with us when it really mattered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she needs you . " Maybe he needed the Volkers now , Kevin admitted to himself . " She changed her mind . That 's kids for you , " he added sympathetically . Volker 's face undammed like river ice . He stepped back and swung the door wide . " Do n't want Mother hurt again like the last time , " he muttered . He followed Kevin and Jane through the icy , unheated porch into the front room . The living room was n't much warmer . In the kitchen archway , Kevin could see a mellow light beaming . Jane walked in , circling the knotty pine cocktail table , memorizing the shabby sofa and carefully angled chairs . She walked finally to the opposite wall and paused before a photograph of herself  --  the standard out-of-focus high school graduation picture that looked as if the mists of time webbed its surface the moment its subject was captured . Kevin edged closer , watching Jane absorb her own image in an alien environment . She had virtually no personal vanity  --  yet , but her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pan collar , the curled hair , the barrette caught awkwardly near one temple . The late Lynn Volker had been a fresh , attractive but unspectacular girl . Jane was her spitting image . Kevin and Volker , linked by a begrudging , unspoken mutual awe , regarded Jane as raptly as she studied her own likeness . Jane stared so intently at the photo behind its shield of glass , within its cheap metallic frame , that Kevin feared it would melt , shatter , slip off the wall . A crash made both men jump . Jane was unmoved . In the oblong of kitchen light , a shadow froze . Mrs. Volker stepped over the shattered water glass at her feet and edged into the room , her expression obscured by the light behind her . " Jane-Lynn ? ? " Jane 's shoulders stiffened . Her profile tensed further , if that was possible . Kevin foresaw a repetition of her earlier rejection of the Volkers . He fumbled for some conversational double-talk to derail it , mask it , mute it . 43  | Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She looked from woman to man , father to mother , from Volker to Volker , stranger to stranger . Volker looked the same as when Jane had last seen him a few months ago , but his wife had faded  --  the permanent wave and color rinse had slipped from her oncemeticulously done hair , leaving her ghost-gray . " You must have been really dark-haired once . " Jane addressed the woman , who seemed to need to stop and remember before nodding dazed agreement . " I have your coloring , but his features , if he were thinner . " Mrs. Volker gasped and pressed the corner of a cotton dishcloth to her mouth . Volker made an odd sound , half admission , half denial . Kevin went to Jane . " Can we sit down ? " he asked gently . The Volkers ' quick glances consulted each other . " Adelle , I do n't want your heart broken again . . . , " Volker began . " Remember what happened in the Cities . " " She 's our girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our girl is dead . We know that now , thanks to all the publicity and those dental records from Montana . Our Lynn died on that camping trip in Montana years ago . I guess us being made the fools of the whole state for claiming this one at least got that much clear . " " Sit down , " Mrs. Volker breathlessly urged Jane , ignoring her husband . Kevin guided Jane to the sofa and sat with her . Mrs. Volker hesitated , then perched on the other side of Jane , her hands smoothing the print apron over her knees . Volker stood in the center of the room watching them . " Would you . . . like something to eat , Jane-Lynn ? " Mrs. Volker 's voice was timorous . Jane looked at Kevin . " Some hot coffee would be great , Mrs. Volker . If you 've got it on , " he amended politely with a quick smile , thus ensuring that any motherly woman would make it anyway . " Of course , Doctor . We 're old-fashioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . drink coffee ? " " I do n't know , Mrs. Volker . Let 's find out . "  | " Jane . . . anything you want ? " " Bread , " Jane blurted . " Zucchini bread ; it was good . " " Oh . " The older woman 's face fell . She looked like the drawing of a conventional mother from a first-grade primer . Kevin expected Mrs. Volker to put up her hands and say , " Run , Spot , run . " Instead , she apologized . " That was frozen from last summer 's crop . We used it all up . What I brought you in the Cities last fall was the last loaf . " " Anything would be fine , Mrs. Volker , " Kevin put in . " We 've been on the road , eating at fast-food joints . Anything homemade would be an improvement . " The woman stood and practically backed away , unwilling to take her eyes off Jane . Volker did n't move to help his wife in the kitchen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate had chosen for his wildly unconventional Jane . " You been on the road , " Volker repeated . " How come ? " " Tracing Jane 's past . I think I 've solved it . The what and why , anyway  --  if not the how . " " It help her any ? " " Maybe . I was hoping you would help her more . " He shrugged , the old man , and , wheezing , shuffled over to find his pipe . Jane was right , he could use a diet . " We kind of gave up on her , Dr. Blake , for our own sakes , after that news story by that Bowman woman came out , about how deluded we were and our real daughter was so many bones and teeth out there in the wildwoods . It kind of took the heart out of us , the scandal and all . They still try to call us from those national rags , looking for a new angle  --  a new way to make fools of us on their front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Volker said . She had paused in the doorway again , an enigmatic figure bearing a tray . " Like it was an honor . " " Why are you here ? " Volker asked . " To tell you that you were n't crazy , " Kevin said , " to say that everything you thought happened to you years ago did happen . " This bombshell should have had both Volkers shouting 45  | hallelujah and eating out of Kevin 's hand . Instead , silence greeted his announcement . " Well , that 's something , " Volker said at last . " A big Twin Cities psychiatrist saying we 're not crazy . You acted like we were n't much better than slugs when we came down to the Cities to say " ? he glanced at Jane ? " she was our daughter . You just sat back and waited while everyone else proved we were n't  --  the reporters , the police . Now you show up again . Now we 're her long-lost parents . What 's the matter , Dr. Blake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people might say that , if I told them what I had seen two nights ago . " " Then keep your mouth shut , " Volker advised tersely , " like we should have twenty-five years ago . " Mrs. Volker 's hand had stolen across her lap to rest feather light on Jane 's jacket sleeve . She tugged on the material . " Lynn , honey . . . Jane . You remember us any ? " " She ca n't , Mother ! " Volker 's voice held a twang of agony . " This one never saw us , never knew us , and even if she did , she 's still got no memory worth worrying about . She 's still an amnesiac , is n't that right , Doc ? She does n't know shit from shinola about anything ? ! " Jane glanced to Kevin , confused . " Shinola ? " He shook his head . " That is Jane 's particular .. . malady , Mr. Volker . She knows a lot of things she should n't , and does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them . " " Do n't cuss in front of the girl , Jack , " Mrs. Volker put in by rote . Her hand slid down to take Jane 's hand in her puckered palm and absently stroke it with her fingers . Jane accepted the familiarity with taut tolerance , her eyes sliding first to the photograph of herself on the wall , then to Kevin . " I know , " Mrs. Volker mused to herself , " that if we let Lynn . . . let Jane . . . see her old room  --  Lynn 's , that is  --  I know she 'd remember something . Remember us . She ca n't look this much like Lynn and not remember . " Kevin 's mouth opened to explain why Jane most certainly could , but Mrs. Volker 's sad eyes pinned his lips shut before he could speak .  | " You said you came back , you brought her back , because she really is our daughter , did n't you , Doctor ? " Volker asked . " Yes , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Mother wants . Let 's take her upstairs , show her where she grew up . " His wife did n't wait for agreement . " Come along , dear , I know you 'll remember something if you only see ? " Docile , Jane allowed Mrs. Volker 's hand to tug her to her feet . " And take your jacket off  --  heavens , you 're going to stay awhile . Make yourself to home . " Mrs. Volker 's fingers unzipped the down jacket with maternal presumption . Kevin tensed , as he had when the clerk had gone snipping at Jane with scissors , but Jane seemed subdued , perhaps by her encounter with her own image on this unpretentious wall . They stood awkwardly around the coffee table , four dark circles of untasted coffee steaming like a campfire in their midst . Gently , Mrs. Volker teased Jane toward the dining room , step by step . Kevin and her husband let themselves be drawn into the women 's wake by default . " She 's not ? " Kevin began , crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear what he thought . All their emotions revolved around the centerpiece of Jane now . Around Jane , and what Jane would do , say , remember . Or not remember , Kevin reminded himself . She was good at not remembering . The dark wood door at one side of a built-in dining room buffet opened on dim stairs suspended between plain , beige-painted walls . At the top a tiny window squeezed into the apex of the roof . A half wall topside kept anyone from falling down the stairwell . It had been an attic originally , the space . Maybe fifteen years ago , Papa Volker or some local handyman had paneled it with walnut veneer and installed built-in bookshelves . Mrs. Volker had sprinkled the linoleum floor with rag rugs and festooned the undereave windows with yellow  | curtains . They 'd installed a couple of single beds for girlish sleepovers , and a stereo , and called it a teenager 's room . Kevin turned around in the big , unheated space . A Rolling Stones poster on one wall brought a brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the University of Minnesota Hospitals , back at the Probe unit . Record albums kept packed company on the lowest bookshelves . Cheerleading pom-pons  --  orange and purple  --  decorated one wall like crossed swords . A slightly shabby chorus line of stuffed toys paraded along one bed pushed against the murky wall . Mrs. Volker went to an undersized door and jerked it open . " She had plenty of closet space . I had Father build in lots of that under the eaves . Girls always need room for things . . . . Do you remember , honey ? Do you remember any of this ? " God , I hope not , Kevin thought unkindly . Jane was silent . " Maybe this was a mistake , " Kevin admitted . " You do n't understand , Mrs. Volker . I never said that Jane lived here with you , as your daughter . Only that she was your daughter . " " Ai n't that the same thing ? " Volker asked truculently . " Not . . . in this case . Jane is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand how unique ? " " Me ! " Jane burst out . She pulled the closet door further open , drawing a mirror image of herself full-face into their midst . It was as if a ghost of the dead girl  --  Lynn Elizabeth Volker  --  had materialized in the echoing room with them . Mrs. Volker choked on a sob . Her husband pushed his hands deep into his pockets and turned to the window , leaving his broad , red-plaid back drawn on the rest of them like a shade . Kevin felt an odd jolt of precognitive deja vu , as if a scene never enacted in this room , and never to be enacted here , had laid its fuzzy outlines over an image from the past burned into the mirror . Jane reached out to something wedged under a corner of  | the full-length mirror  --  a faded prom memoir , a dance card dangling a tassel . " Me ? " Jane asked this time , less certain . No one answered , and before anyone could try , Jane turned back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new hope to Mrs. Volker 's hopelessly ordinary features . " Yes , it 's yours , dear . You lived here . I sewed the curtains at the window with some material I ordered from Sears . We put the half bath in for you " ? her eyes flickered to another door ? " everything for you , even the music you liked to play so loud , that Father always complained about over his head ? " " I did n't complain . I just said it was loud , and it was . For God 's sake , Mother , the girl is n't a saint just because she 's dead ! " " She 's not dead ! She 's here ! Dr. Blake brought her back to us . She may not remember . . . oh , try , try , " she begged Jane . " Try to remember . " A poignant silence dominated them all . Kevin Blake , psychiatrist , wished he were an honest exorcist capable of banishing all the ghosts called into this room  --  ghosts of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . " Try to remember , " came a clear , plaintive soprano . Music faint as a radiator hiss chimed into the room . Kevin jerked his head toward the stereo setup . The sound was too weak to pinpoint , but the familiar lyrics and music from The Fantasticks , typical teenage girl fare , unwound verse by cloying verse . Jane was standing in the middle of the room , looking normal as north woods apple pie in her jeans and shirt and boots , her eyes closed , her head lifted , her arms and fingers spread slightly , as though she was contemplating engraving an upright snow angel on the air . " Try to remember when ? " Mrs. Volker inhaled a hiccough of air and then folded her hands over her mouth . Volker had turned from the window and froze , watching Jane and listening . " Try to remember ? " 49  | The repetition was beginning to wear on all of them . " Where on earth ? ? " Volker began hoarsely , looking at Kevin . Kevin stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kneeling to the row of record albums . He kinked his head sideways and read through Steely Dan/Michael Jackson/ Joni Mitchell/the Beach Boys to . . . Cats ! and Chorus Line and  --  eureka ! " The Fantasticks ! " he announced , pulling out the album and edging the record from the jacket . " Try to Remember , ' " he read off the label . " It was . . . her favorite , " Mrs. Volker said . Kevin frowned at her , momentarily disconnected . " Lynn 's . Lynn 's favorite song . They even mentioned it in the yearbook . The Crookston Excelsior . Under her picture . They listed all their favorite songs . That was Lynn 's . " It still played in the room . " The record 's here , " Kevin said , shaking it a little in his clammy hands . He glanced to the motionless turntable under its dust-blanketed smoke-colored Plexiglas cover . " It 's impossible to hear it . " Nothing moved or spoke in the room . Only the music unspun regularly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kevin wondered  --  or Memorex ? Then something caught Kevin 's eye , a subtle , quick , mechanical movement , right where he should have looked for it . Close-up . The tape deck , of course . And the almost undetectable motion of a tiny cassette reeling past hidden heads , playing " Try to Remember . " " Jane , " Kevin began . " Me , " sang Jane back . " Me , me , me . " He turned . She looked like an actress playing Helen Keller , head thrown back now , eyes closed , mouth open , limbs splayed as if they were principal sensors in her body . " Jane , stop it ! " But she was deaf to him , blind to the Volkers . The room was pouring into her and she was funneling it back at itself . " Try to Remember " found its full volume , the plaintive song reverberating in the dead space . 50  | Kevin pushed the Eject button . The mechanism jammed . He clawed at the thin plastic window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on , trying to remember . A new motion caught his eye . Above him , the record turntable noiselessly began spinning under its dust cover . He reached to stop it , but at his knees record albums began spilling from the shelf , spinning across the floor as if the linoleum were a giant turntable , spinning  --  and playing . Rock beats , folk ballads , surf rhythms , blues  --  they all mingled , ghosting over each other , the slick album covers spinning at the same inexorable rate , perfectly , mechanically . Thirty-three and a third revolutions per minute . " All me , " Jane was announcing over the cacophony . " Me , me , me , meeeee ! " Dresser drawers slid open , strewing pieces of Lynn Volker 's lost life across the rag rugs and matching chintz floral bedspreads  --  limp underwear and faded blue jeans , shapeless sweaters and socks , a red leather clutch purse , beads , a long-forgotten stack of wallet-size high school graduation photos  --  dead ringers for the portrait downstairs  --  unfurling like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ragged chorus line . Mrs. Volker was screaming , her apron thrown over her head . Volker had spread-eagled himself against the window , as if defying anything to pass him . Kevin forced himself upright amid a blizzard of clothes and stationery . A lead pencil made a pass at his left eye . Crepe paper swagged his arm . Lynn Volker 's life ? memorialized in this room  --  fell apart all around him . There was no wind , nothing except the moving things and the motionless people and the raucous music . He skidded over the slick , spinning albums , tripping , losing his balance , then recapturing it , until he got to Jane . Once there , he froze like the others . He 'd seen mental illness take a lot of strange physical forms ; he 'd never seen anyone so transported as Jane . " Is she . . . possessed ? " Volker ground out over the screaming music . Superstition snapped Kevin 's awe . He reached out and 51  | touched Jane 's wrist . The flannel shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive shot of static . He felt his fingertips tingle , then reached to touch her other arm . This time the phenomenon did n't surprise him . Nothing would surprise him . " Jane . Open your eyes . Your eyes  --  open them ! " Beneath her closed eyelids he could see the tremor of REMs , rapid eye movements that signal dreaming . She was n't dreaming now , he knew , but perhaps her neurons were . " Wake up . Open your eyes ! " The dark eyelashes spasmed , but her eyes remained closed . " Jane , it 's Dr. Blake , and when I say the word , you 'll open your eyes and your ears and your mind and you 'll be in the room with me and the Volkers . " The confidence in his tone was pure reflex . He was n't sure , but he was going to try to produce a waking state by resorting to a hypnosis-inducing codeword . An old word from their first sessions , before Jane had so much as repaired a broken fingernail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its sacred words were his only weapon . It might work , that twentiethcentury talisman of his , and it might not . He leaned close to her ear , chilled by the unnatural warmth her body radiated , and whispered , repeated , shouted , " Ecnalubma . . . ecnalubma . . . ecnalubma " like a litany . " Try to remember  --  Try to remember  --  Try to remember .. The music died track by track until that last phrase rang sweet and low , repeating with stuck-needle stubbornness until it faded abruptly . Clothes slumped to the floor , rolling felt-tip pens rocked into stillness . Kevin 's hands on Jane 's wrists felt so cold he could have just retracted them from a deep freeze . Jane 's eyes were opening , slowly , the browns of her irises expanding into focus . She frowned at Kevin . " Me , " she insisted . Something left her eyes , some fleeting , fleeing memory . " And . . . not me . " He nodded . " No . Not you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , engulfing him with a welcome wave of warmth , then dissipating beyond him . She began shivering , violently . Kevin sank with her to the floor , held her teeth-chattering face against his shoulder , rocked her , warmed her , although he felt his own aftermath of chill . Mrs. Volker had recovered enough to drop her apron . She was moving stiffly around the room , picking up the scattered belongings . " I kept them , " she explained wearily . " I kept it all just as it was when Lynn . . . went away . We thought she 'd come back from that summer in Montana . And then , when she was reported missing , we never believed she was dead . We thought she 'd come back . We knew she 'd come back . " " You love her , " Volker accused Kevin . Kevin felt like a kid again , sitting on the floor of his messy room , confronting eternal adult charges . " Somebody has to , " he answered . Mrs. Volker began disjointedly humming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waist , in a way that was murder on an aging back , to pick up Lynn 's strewn underwear . Jane 's teeth chattered on the coffee cup rim . Kevin steadied her hand until she took the first , bracing sip . Her eyes flashed him a rare shot of gratitude before widening in caffeine-struck surprise . " Bitter , " she commented . No one commented back . They all hugged their microwave-rewarmed coffee cups in silence , Jane and Kevin on the spavined sofa , the Volkers on their separate chairs . Who would have thought , 53  | Kevin wondered , that the Volkers would have had a microwave ? Life was chock full of surprises . " Did . . . Lynn . . . ever demonstrate any exceptional abilities ? " Kevin figured it would n't hurt to ask . " Never ! No . Lynn was a normal girl all the way , " Volker said . His wife picked at the pink seam tape binding her apron edge . " She had a gift for finding lost things . " " Coincidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who claim we saw a UFO a quarter century ago . Then we were nuts five years ago for believing Lynn had n't really died in that wilderness she got lost in . Now Lynn 's been proven dead and we 're supposed to say our dead daughter was a weirdo ? " " What 's a weirdo ? " Jane asked Kevin . Mrs. Volker 's eyes rebuked her husband . " Someone special . " Kevin briefly pulled Jane 's head to his shoulder . " Like you . " He faced Volker again . " Look . You 're not the only one who saw a UFO . I did , too , two nights ago . Maybe the same one , for all I know . " " You saw it ? " Mrs. Volker sat forward on her maple rocking chair , stilling it . " I saw it . Not as well as I should have . I was . . . worried about Jane . " " That 's where she 's from ! " Volker was standing , his head partially obscuring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my God , " said his wife , and pointed behind him . He turned impatiently , his head shifting out of the way . The photograph of Lynn Volker still hung where it had for seven years . Not even the glass had cracked , despite the telekinetic storm upstairs . But " Oh , my God , Jack  --  it 's reversed ! " Kevin stood , too . He saw it but he did n't believe it . Lynn Elizabeth Volker was still smiling at the world  --  with empty white eyes and fiberglass hair , out of a shadowed face , wearing a black blouse . . . Volker pointed to Jane like an Old Testament prophet confronting Pharaoh . " Get her out of here ! Get her out of our house ! "  | " It 's not her fault , " Kevin said . " She 's just . . . what she is . " She 's not ours ! Never was . " Volker was advancing , his sixtyish bulk more threatening because it seemed such an unlikely source of violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife was baby-stepping toward him , her face schizophrenic with mixed emotions . " Please what , Adelle ? I do n't care what we saw , what they did to us in that thing all those years ago . I do n't care what he saw two nights ago , or what they did to her ! She ai n't ours . She 's an unnatural thing and I want her out of our house ! " " She 's flesh of your flesh , " Kevin struck back . " Your genes . That 's how she was made  --  they took a cell from your wife , who must have been just pregnant at the time . Before even you or Mrs. Volker knew that  --  they knew . And that 's all it takes , a single cell . Hell , even we can do it today . Test-tube babies . Genetic engineering . Do n't you read the papers in Crookston ? Baby Louise in England , dozens here at home . It 's routine medical practice . If we can do it , why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hear me , Dr. Blake ? It was .. . what did the psychiatrists try to call it twenty-five years ago ? ? small-scale mass hysteria . Delusion . We thought ' we saw the ship . We thought ' we saw those . . . things .. . on it . We thought ' we were up in the damn thing . " Well , we were n't crazy ; we were wrong ! We were dreamers , we were fools , and we are n't going to be nobody 's fools anymore . We deny it . So what do you do with your precious Jane Doe now , who was n't good enough for us to be her parents before ? What do you do with her now ? We do n't want her . We got grief enough . " Volker 's vehemence had left Jane cowering against Kevin 's hip , like a puppy that knows only the fact of its misbehavior , not its specific sin . It left Kevin swallowing his own sour rage , his regret at having exposed Jane to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He remembered his own parents , whom he saw too seldom . He wondered if they would disown him when the  | newspapers made what they would of him , of their brilliant , never-understood only son , now on the run . Mrs. Volker had crept up on Kevin during the outburst . Her hand on his arm nagged for his attention . " Jane is . . . Lynn 's sister , is n't she , Dr. Blake ? " " Not sister , exactly ? " " Twin ? She 's her twin ? " Pathetic eagerness to grasp the unthinkable made Adelle Volker 's face girlish in its uncertainty . " More than twin ? " Kevin had n't thought it all out himself . He paused to phrase it accurately . " Jane is .. . Lynn 's undeveloped self . The genetic raw material , unshaped by environmental factors . She 's what your Lynn was when she was born  --  a baby , I guess . Only Jane 's all grown up . " " She 's nothing ! " Volker pulled his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go tryin ' to make that creature into some helpless innocent to wring my wife 's heart . If she 's anybody 's baby , she 's your problem , Dr. Blake . " You got a lot of guts comin ' here again and upsettin ' Mother ' n me and makin ' us think there 's any hope for our daughter . There never was . Lynn was an ordinary girl and she died . She died , and we know it now ! She was just unlucky enough to have weirdo parents who may have been crazy once but they 're not gon na do it again ! " In the ensuing silence , Kevin heard an old-fashioned clock ticking for the first time . He reflexively glanced around to see where it was kept , but his eyes snagged on the photo-reverse portrait of Lynn Volker and stopped . Maybe the old man was right ; maybe what had once been positive ? the Volkers ' need for a daughter , Jane 's late-found need to belong  --  had turned negative . At his side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard it , like it came from a long way inside . " Kevin . I want to go away . " He nodded at the Volkers . Mrs. Volker 's face was frozen in distress . No one had consulted her , any more than they had when Lynn had vanished in Montana . He took Jane 's hand and pulled her up beside him . He really was her only family now .  | " I thought ? " Kevin began . . . and ended . " I thought you folks could do her some good . Or the other way around . She 's got a lot to figure out for herself . " " She 's a freak , " Volker answered harshly , his farmer 's face hard-edged as a plow blade . " We never could have spawned her . Better to have our daughter dead and normal than like that . " Kevin turned Jane toward the door . " If anybody comes looking for us . . . her ? " " We never saw you . That 's what we shoulda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' .... " ' " Dr. Blake ? " Mrs. Volker stepped from the shadow of her husband , her hands working behind the screening curtain of her apron . " You 'll . . . take care of her ? " " Yeah . " He had n't meant to sound so weary . " I 'll get her . . . somewhere ... safe and sound , Mrs. Volker . Home by midnight okay ? " he could n't help adding with something else he had n't meant to sound  --  bitterness . Adelle Volker just shook her grizzled , untended head and watched them leave through her tears . Kevin shut the door behind them , not waiting for those inside to make the final , excluding gesture . " Cold out here , " Kevin commented , looking down the snow-whitened street at all the snugly closed front doors in Crookston . " They did n't like me , " Jane noted quietly from the curve of his arm . " Fair play . You did n't like them very much at first , either . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't they ? " He could n't help laughing . " Conceited , are n't you ? Except that you 're always so damn literal . " " You wanted to keep me away from them , away from the other doctors and Dr. Swanson , from those men . Even from ? " She glanced up evocatively at the white-washed winter sky . " From them , ' I know . Yeah , I guess you are pretty popular , come to think of it . And it 's gon na get worse . " " Is that because I 'm a freak ? " " Probably . " 57  | " I know what freak ' is ; an abnormally formed organism ; especially , a person or animal regarded as a curiosity or a monstrosity . ' " Jane , shut up . " He opened the van door and boosted her inside . But when he got behind the wheel , she was waiting for him with unrelenting logic and her uncanny , emotionless perception . " You wanted them to like me this time . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm . . . " She paused so long that Kevin found himself hanging on the next word , as if it might be as important as Zyunsinth . It was . " I 'm . . . sorry , " Jane said , her face puzzled . Perhaps she herself did n't understand why she felt compelled to say that for the first time in her life . Kevin hugged her across the void between the seats . " I am , too . I am so damn sorry . " Over her shoulder , the blank face of the Volkers ' ultraordinary white frame house stared impassively back at him . The town of Crookston did n't look one bit sorry at all . Jane threw her third Baby Ruth wrapper on the floor . Kandy 's van was n't exactly pristine inside ; Kevin twisted to survey the collection of brown paper grocery bags and newspapers piling atop Kandy 's original debris in the space behind him . The plowed winter highway unrolled like a silver Christmas ribbon tarnished gray after the holidays . Winter painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rough charcoal strokes for leaf-stripped trees and bushes fringing the overall shawl of snow . The boring landscape numbed Kevin 's survival instincts ; driving did n't help him keep alert , but Jane , of course , could n't spell him at the wheel . No driver 's education taught in the great big High School in the Sky . Kevin knew he should n't be heading south for the Twin Cities , but he did n't know where to go anymore and maybe " they " ? whether police or G-men or extraterrestrials  | were n't following . The newspapers had said nothing , not even about anyone finding the two bodies north of Duluth ... . The van swerved as Kevin felt sleep buzz his brain with a kamikaze pass . Jane 's big brown eyes immediately questioned him  --  a look he was beginning to read as accusing . Paranoia . Nice Greek root word . Paranoos  --  demented . A shrink of all people should be immune , he knew , but put anyone under enough stress and all the standard afflictions of the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Put the wrappers in the empty bag , " he instructed Jane . Maybe terminal tidiness would ensure normality . Another fancy phrase described that delusion , Kevin knew , but he was too fatigued to hunt for it . He glanced in the flat silver oval of the sideview mirror . Was that Jeep staying too close too long ? Come on , either pass or get off the pot . . . . God , he was beginning to feel tired . " Kevin ? " " Nothing . I was just watching the car behind us . " Jane was growing hypersensitive to his moods now . The longer she spent with him , the more she seemed to know him , and there was something . . . freakish . . . about how perceptively she could tune in to the blips on his mental EKG . " Are they following us ? " Her jacket rasped as she twisted around to look . " I do n't know . Maybe I 'll try to lose ' em . " He sped up , the van hesitating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behind them the Jeep , muffled with its winter canvas top , diminished into a squarish blob . " All right ! " Kevin congratulated himself . " Guess I was wrong . " " Want a candy bar ? " Jane wondered next . " God , no ! Anything sweet right now would turn my stomach . " Her face fell at his refusal . " Hey , it 's okay . You can eat them . Maybe they 'll keep you warm . This van is colder than a well-digger 's designer shorts . " 59  | Jane signaled polite puzzlement , then bent to scrape up the wrappers and crush them into the bag behind her seat . Kevin pulled a hand off the steering wheel and thrust it into his jacket pocket . A cold roll of bills curved into his palm , almost as comforting to him as steel balls to Captain Queeg . Money . With money they had a chance . " Where are we going ? " Jane asked . Kevin could n't bring himself to answer . * " They wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nordstrom 's face made the ridiculing little grimace that indicated mute disagreement . " They might not . He will , " Nordstrom said . " Why ? " The imported psychiatrist threw his fur-lined leather coat over the plastic-shell chair , stationing his ostrich-skin briefcase by its splayed steel peg legs . The coat and case almost dwarfed Eric Nordstrom , a slight man whose air of neat effacement made him seem even smaller . " Blake 's an amateur , " Nordstrom continued . " A rules player despite his surface disrespect for convention . He 's too used to putting rats through mazes . He 's forgotten how to be one . He 'll come back here because he ca n't help himself . " Turner leaned into his molded plastic chair . Although small , the interview room in the federal building felt chilly , partly because national government policy demanded heat conservation  --  mostly because of the scalpel 's edge of cold Nordstrom had brought in from the outside . Turner disliked the man , but he did n't know why . Turner studied his vaguely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , the affected rimless glasses . It was possible to imagine Nordstrom 's mother disliking her new infant on sight ; possible even to imagine Nordstrom born with a cold , winking monocle of glass propped up before each pale gimlet eye . . . . " You 'd like him better than you like me . " Nordstrom hefted the briefcase to extract a fistful of manila folders .  | " But it 's me you have to work with , and him you have to catch . " " Who ? " Turner sat up , wary . " Blake . Young Dr. Blake . He and I attended Harvard together , did you know ? " No . . . kidding . Turner made himself smile cynically . " Oh ? Old school ties going to get in your way , Doctor ? " The other man laughed , an oddly irritating sound . " We never got along , Blake and I. He was a nobody from the north woods with a few brains and a certain charm . Scholarship student . " The last two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York family , that he did n't have to work for a living , and that he certainly did n't have to work for the government . " Then this job should be a busman 's holiday for you , " Turner commented . " Busman 's holiday ? " Was the man impervious to conversational cliches ? " You 'll enjoy working on Blake , then ? " " Ah . You are a professional , are n't you , Mr. Turner ? I forget that , sometimes . I wo n't be sorry , no , to interrogate Blake . But that makes it better , does n't it , Mr. Turner ? If you have to use a dirty tool , better it be suited for the job . " " I never said ? " " You do n't have to like me . You just have to need me . Dr. Kevin Blake never did . But he will . " Nordstrom fanned the pale folders , each bearing a slim burden of papers . " I 've got copies of his med school and residency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much on Dr. Kevin Blake as there is to find . Let me assure you , Mr. Turner , he 'll come back . " His hands , clean as a surgeon 's , snapped the folders into a tidy pile . " Now , tell me , have you found the latest address on his parents ? " Turner reached to the notebook in his jacket pocket , feeling inexplicably reluctant . 61  | " Jesus Christ ! " Martin Kandinsky , a wool cap jammed on his lowered head and his bare hands crammed into the pockets of an ancient wool jacket , backed away from the figure he 'd collided with . He squinted into the five o'clock shadow of a winter 's dusk . " Watch where you 're goin ' , man ! " " I 'm there already . " Kandinsky squinted harder , studying the stranger who 'd confronted him . " Kevin ! I did n't recognize you without the beard . Holy balls ! What 're you doing here ? " " Here " was the parking lot behind the Student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streamed by , too bundled against the subzero temperatures to notice anyone crazy enough to stop and talk in the open air . " I 'm here to make a buy , what else ? " Kevin joked . " Do n't kid about that , man . " Kandy looked around with classic paranoia . " The cops have been on my case for the pot they found when they trashed my place . " " They trashed your place ? " Kandy shrugged . " It was trashed already , no big deal . " Kevin grinned briefly . He could picture the police turning Kandy 's upside-down digs inside out . Kandy accumulated junk mail the way compulsive shoppers stockpile hotpads . " I figured it 'd be safer to catch you here , " Kevin admitted . " I need to find out what 's going on . " " You ! You 're what 's going on ! You were n't gone more than ten hours before the gestapo came around asking about you . They put your office under a microscope . I  | stashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impounded it . " " City cops or federal ? " " Who knows ? They were kinda vague . You know how those storm troopers can get when they 're on a rampage . They gave my joint  --  and I do mean joint  --  a good going over . Promised me a stint in the cooler for possession if I did n't cooperate , but all they got was a few shreds . So .. . enough about me . How you been ? " Kevin clapped his friend on the shoulder . " How about I buy you dinner ? Then you can sing for your supper . " Kandy followed Kevin to his own parked van , pausing to inspect it . " Nice wheels . " He wrenched open the side door and jumped inside , collapsing like Big Bird on gangly crossed legs . Belatedly , he leaned forward to examine the passenger in the front seat . " Jane Doe , I presume . " He glanced at Kevin . " I figured you 'd have Wonder Woman with you . Enchante , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare hand from the seat back it clutched . He lifted it to his lips for an enthusiastic smack . Jane watched Kandy with deep confusion while Kevin sprinted around to the driver 's side and jammed himself back behind the wheel . He twisted to watch two opposite personalities on parade  --  Kandy ingratiatingly ugly and utterly impudent , as usual ; Jane taking it all in with grave , miss-nothing eyes . Kandy extended his hand for a conventional shake . " I see Kevin 's got you all done up like Cathy Coed . Good thinking . My name 's Martin Kandinsky , but they call me Kandy . I call you pretty cute . " Jane blinked and shook his hand . " Are . . . you one of Kevin 's . . . other . . . patients ? " she asked politely . Kevin smiled . Jane was progressing ; not long before she could n't accept the idea that he had any patients besides her . " Wounded , " Kandy groaned , " a direct hit to the psyche . Naw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sane as any shrink ever gets .  | " Speaking of which . . . " Kandy turned his nearsighted eyes on Kevin . " I sure hope you do n't harbor illusions of crashing at your old pad . The gestapo guys took your place to the dry cleaners ; they went over it with everything but lighter fluid and a match . It 's probably still staked out . Actually , oppression is an equal opportunity railroad now . Guy and gal . A female agent came along when they did my place . Maybe they want to use feminine psychology on Jane when they get her . " Kevin winced . First his car , then his condo . Was nothing sacred ? " Where was Cross when all this was going on ? " " You do mean Dr. Cross , Norbert Cross , head of our esteemed Probe intensive psychiatric care unit ? " " Yeah . I know Cross was going to shovel Jane off on some government head-tank in Virginia , but Probe was his baby . He had too much pride to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Cross is gone , Kev . So is Matthews and Swanson and even the Probe unit secretary . The offices are part of the neonatal unit now . Probe is el wipe-o . Gone away for to stay . As if it had never existed . So solly . Computer error . All gone . " " I 've only been away myself for . . . seven , eight days ! How can they ? ? " " You 've been away a lifetime , Kev , believe me . " In silence , Kevin revved the engine and guided the van into the dimming streets . The roadway was narrow , thanks to curbside piles of plowed snow and parked cars lining every avenue . The van crept along . Kevin headed for the nearest McDonald 's , pulled into line and when his turn came bawled an order for them all into the speaker . When the warm , bakery-white bags were thrust through the open window , he dumped them all on Kandy and headed for the lot 's farthest parking space . Kandy began cramming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tearing a ketchup bag open with her teeth and drenching her box of fries . Kevin took one bite of his first quarter-pounder and stopped , his appetite frozen by their innocent gusto . " So where you been ? " Kandy inquired genially.  | " Outstate . " " Okay , I get it . None of my business . But , look , Kevin . This is Space Mountain . The big glide into nowhere . You 're a non-persona now . And the chick , she 's tomorrow 's McNuggets . Those government types are serious . They want you nailed down and they do n't care if they have to do it by the hands and feet . Why do n't you turn yourselves in ? Maybe they just want to give you a medal or something  --  first famous medical mystery solved by the great Kevin Blake . Maybe they 're on the Side of Science . " " Kandy , there are dead bodies behind us . " Kandy whistled . " You ? " When Kevin was silent he glanced to the watching Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Far out . You find anything more out about her  --  how she comes by her , uh , talents ? " " Yeah . But I ca n't say . I ca n't prove it . Nobody 'd believe me . " Kandy tsked consideringly . " That 's what they all say before we haul them away . There 's something you should know . Before the anti  --  A Team took over , I knew this cat ? " " Do n't tell me they interrogated my cat ? " " No way , they left Blue Streak strictly alone . Besides , all cats look alike , especially Russian Blues . Anyway , I know this dude and he 's a computer whiz , can really make those modems sit up and recite Deuteronomy and Numbers . So when they topsy-turvied my place , I had him go into your bank account pronto and whisk your money far , far away . " Kandy extended a Kinko Copies card with a name and account number scrawled on the back . " That 's you , fellah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it before the G-whiz boys and girl got wise , ' cause the money 's in the new account . " " Or maybe they let you think you got away with it and they 've got the bank watching . " Kandy made calf-eyes at Jane and , burst into the chorus of " I Wonder Who 's Paranoid Now ? " " Me . " Kevin snatched the card . " And you , too , if you 're smart . I might try it . Thanks , Kandy . I 'll repay you someday . " 65  | " Say no more . " He stared at Kevin in the almost-dark . " You look terrible , man . Better eat that stuff . Then crash . Then get some bread from the bank . " " Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . I 'll drop you by your car . Do me a last favor on the way ? Pick up a Strib at a corner stand . I need to catch up on what 's been happening around here . " The engine ignited faithfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The van droned under streetlights , bars of alternating dark and light rippling its hood and windshield , mesmerizing Kevin . He paused to let Kandy get the newspaper , then drove on , finally pulling into the emptied campus parking lot and feeling much more noticeable . Kandy cracked the side door , then hesitated , looking back at Kevin . " Take it easy . " He turned to Jane . " A pleasure , Miss Doe . ' Bye . " The door slammed shut , closing out Kandy , the cold and a lot of things Kevin had once cared about . Behind intermittent oblongs of lit windows , the university hummed into evening  --  students and professors working late , staying late , feeling secure and unthreatened . Kevin waited , watching while the yellow jelly-beanbody of Kandy 's old VW chugged out of the lot onto the icy street . He should n't have parked directly under a light , Kevin knew , but right now he needed something warm and yellow . He pulled off his gloves and unfolded the evening edition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper was stiff , cold . Kevin paged through it , ignoring Jane for once , hungry for the familiar black-andwhite of the newspaper 's type style . He was n't anywhere in it , nor was she . They were n't the apple of the public 's eye , and maybe that was worse , maybe it meant they were in deeper trouble . They were anonymous fugitives , free to be plunged into cold storage so deep and frozen that even the sun would n't find them . He scanned for mention of the deaths north of Duluth . As soon as Jane and he found a place to rest , he 'd have to put her under hypnosis and recapture those lost minutes , 66  | find out what had really happened . He 'd have to discover what powers remained to her , and why they 'd manifested themselves so dramatically in the Volkers ' upstairs bedroom . Eat . Crash . Get money . Jane was right ; Kandy was nuts . Kevin had no time for any of that . In a back section under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snagged his trolling eye . Kevin manipulated the paper , trying to illuminate the one-paragraph item . He read it without believing it . Then he looked over the paper 's trembling rim . Jane was watching him , as she so often did . He no longer felt flattered . Yet who else could he talk to ? He finally glimpsed how alone Jane must feel . He finally felt it , finally knew that no one could know . . . even as he most desperately wanted to share it with someone . " Jane , " he said , because she was the only one there . " Jane . Neumeier . Neumeier 's . . . dead . She . . . died . It says of a heart attack . But they 've killed Neumeier somehow . Up in her cabin . Natural causes ! Bullshit . " Tears were gathering in his eyes in the dark , hot tears welling on the lip of chill flesh . " You remember Neumeier ? we went to see her . And she helped us , put me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they killed her , that great old lady . They killed her in the cold and the snow ! Jane  --  you remember . Say you remember ! She died for you  --  you must remember ! " Jane dropped her head . He could see only the crown of her hair , her dark , unconfiding hair . His shocked emotions were steadying now , and he knew he had been unfair , terribly unfair , but so was the world . He knew he should try to heal Jane , protect her as he had sworn , vowed , to do . He knew all that , and knew that he needed healing and protection more . So he sat there , silent , lost in himself and in the insufficiency of that self , meeting the stranger he had become . " I 'm sorry , " Jane said at last , looking up with sober , uncertain eyes . " I 'm sorry . " 67  | Swashbuckling blue and green letters slashed across the white banners crowding the store 's display window . Crimson neon spelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgent , brake-light glow . Jane huddled alone in the van . Kevin had parked , turned off the ignition and , promising not to be gone long , had locked the doors , after making Jane promise in turn not to leave . So she scanned the screaming hieroglyphs of the handlettered signs , trying to recombine them into sense . " Gilbey 's Gin . Fifth or Liter . " Numbers reeled nonsensically to the back of her mind , but words began to merge under the rapid-fire strafing of her eyes . " Four Roses . " " Smirnoff . " " Two for $16.95 ! " " Bailey 's Irish Cream for the Blue Nun . " " Vermouth . " Vermont ? Or very mouth ? Jane 's chin burrowed into her jacket collar as she absorbed the spectacle before her . Kevin considered Zyunsinth a strange word , she marveled , yet his world overflowed with even stranger words and no one noticed . A tingling began worming around her fingertips and toes . Something in her subconscious knew it for subzero cold tentatively taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . Something else within her knew how to meet it , knew how to lull her acuity , her mind , her senses , her body itself to a level that required less heat . She downshifted easily into hypometabolism . Cold , that invisible incubus , bereft of easy warmth to steal , drifted elsewhere . Jane drifted , too . The tingling migrated to her head and rasped there with the faint , rhythmic tenacity of a tree 68  | branch scraping the window outside her room in Willhelm f fall . She stared out the van 's frost-etched window , scanning for landmarks . Some memories were dreams , Kevin had said . And some memories were not . Memories . Jane 's were jumbled . Her mind pawed the jigsaw puzzle pieces , trying to dovetail a coherent image from the ruins . For Roses . War of the Roses . A chaser for the Blue Nun . Chase . Chase her . Chaste . Run , Blue Nun , run . Blue with Cold Duck . And always , above the words that cycled through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Retrieving her . And re-leaving ( relieving ? ) her again  --  odd lights , dispensing color but not warmth . Lights pulsing in the rhythm of delivery and birth . And rebirth . Pausing to withdraw from her the gleaning . . . again . Jane moaned protest and stirred . A tiny light pricked the van 's interior darkness . Some shred of sound scratched the quiet as if it were a screen . Nothing moved , and the doors ' rusted chrome button locks remained depressed . Yet on the van 's silenced radio , a firefly of light cruised the fine-line gradations , illuminated the tiny numbers one by one . Behind closed lids , Jane 's eyes followed the light 's advance and retreat up the scale of stations  --  no , Jane 's eyes led the light up and down the horizontal FM ladder . In the beginning was the light . Sound was an afterthought . A cacophony reminiscent of the massed spinning of Lynn Volker 's slipcased record albums growled sotto voce in the van , echoed in Jane 's mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , English words spoken in un-English accents . The seeking fine red line in her mind automatically dialed them in . Words became voices , dancing phrases in the dark . " If the lynx remain in place , surely the bonds can rejoin . We can ? " " We can nothing . The lynx are merely potential . This one unit is cast free of control , tumbling in the void . " 69  | " The liberation was an act of One . " " Of One , yes , called to by one not of its kind . It is most . . . unprecedented that those of us on deep extradition should revert so primitively . " " The One has been adjusted ? " " The One has submerged in All . And the mother-cell has sent another One to add to All , with new instructions . " " We have been . . . as we are . . . for some time . " " True . But we are All , and All wishes to make us more . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , the rogue probe is lost and we will not be complete until all our data-bearers are gathered again . " " What will the new one-in-all instruct ? " " That which serves the mother of us all  --  who is the child-cell . " " We have not completely severed the lynx . " " No . But we do not retain enough control to recall the probe . " " Does it sense us still , this rogue unit , do we think ? " " We think . . . but we do not sense much anymore . It is a sorrow that the old skills become so unnecessary . " " That way lies oneness . " " Which . . . one . . . of us moved to let the unit go ? " " We are assimilated now . " " Then it does not matter ; we are repaired . Or are all of us suspect now ? " " Perhaps the voyager cell will know when we glean its message . " Behold the imaging . It is pale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself in the swamp of it and sink beneath the weight of it . " " We have surrendered probes before . " " But never on their own initiative . " Jane 's hand waved before her face as if to banish gnats . A grating crack echoed in the metal-walled van . She jerked upright , her eyes wide open . " Sleepyhead , " Kevin was accusing fondly , jamming himself into the van 's newly lit interior with a wedge of 70  | cold and a brown paper bag . The door slammed shut , encasing them both in lurid red-lit dimness again . " Hey , you got the radio going all by yourself ? You 're getting to be quite a techie . Jane , the Radio Wave Girl . Sorry to take so long ; there was a line at the checkout counter . " He pulled off his gloves to wrench the dial and slide the bar of light from number to number . Voices and vocals Dopplered in and out of range . Country western whining blended with rock screeching and middle-of-the-road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and narrowing her eyes . Her bare hands hugged her upper arms as if she felt cold . Kevin glanced her way . " What ? " " Lynx , " she repeated with mournful certainty . " The lynx are gone . " He looked puzzled for a moment , his face leprosied with neon backwash . " Lynx ? Still thinking about Zyunsinth in . . . cold storage , Jane ? No more fur coats , thank God . No lynx , no opossum , not even a baby rabbit or two . I ca n't afford it , and neither can you . We 'll get to a motel , and then we 'll get warm . " " Why are the lynx gone ? " Jane persisted with childlike monotony as Kevin backed the van out of the lot . He was too weary to answer , but he did . " Endangered species , I guess . Getting extinct . Too many ladies with too few things to do wanting to buy dead animal skins . " Jane plucked at her jacket sleeve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' but like feathers . Did ducks die for my jacket ? " " Jane , I do n't know how they get down  --  maybe they shear it like lambs ' wool . Or harvest it by the handful . Maybe Santa 's elves throw it from the sky . Or maybe people kill ducks and geese and take it . " " It 's not good for things to die , " she said . " People do n't like for things to die . But everything has to , sometime . It 's when people or animals die . . . too soon , too painfully , too uselessly  --  or even sometimes too late  --  that we 're sad about it . " A wail chainsawed through the cold throat of the night , a wail that wobbled up and down the minor scale .  | Adrenaline hammered panic into Kevin 's heartbeat , torched his mind with indecision . Reflex and second thought went one-on-one against each other . A police siren . His foot tensed on the gas pedal , torn between slamming down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whining howl grew shriller . Every good-citizen urge pounded into Kevin 's skull was nudging his foot to the brake , teasing the steering wheel to the curb . Was it wiser to pull over , passive , and assume  --  hope  --  that the official vehicle would barrel on past ? Wiser to bolt ? Fight or flight or just belly-up give up ? Only split-hair seconds had elapsed while the macrocomputer of Kevin 's mind ran its options . In the rearview mirror , he watched a weaving ball of crimson flash nearer . The van was still moving at normal street speed ; he had done nothing at all . Before he could change that , the oncoming vehicle loomed larger in the mirror  --  large , and white , with a word stenciled across its top in big , legible letters . A-m-b-u-l-a-nc-e . Relief streamed to Kevin 's farthest-flung nerve ends . " Ecnalubma ! " he announced jubilantly . " It 's only an ecnalubma . " He twisted to watch the ambulance scream abreast while he edged the van to the curb . Rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head-on , the backwards letters meant to be seen only in rearview mirrors . Once , months before , Jane had interpreted that careful gibberish as a real word . That was the August night when the ambulance had brought her wasted , naked body all the way from a rural Crow Wing bluff top to the University of Minnesota Hospitals in Minneapolis . " Ecnalubma , " Kevin repeated , letting his eyes revert the backwards consonants and vowels to their proper meaning . He sighed as the shriek of the passing vehicle droned into the darkness . The person-long lump on the rear gurney had looked vague and anonymous . Heart attack victim ? Bleeding ulcers ? Some more abstruse malady ? Dr. Blake was relieved to diagnose only one nonmedical fact : no ambulance was going to play pursuit vehicle for the CIA . He 72  | wondered how " paranoia " would read backwards , and painstakingly worked it out in his muddied mind . Aionapara , para . . . aionarap . Belatedly , he glanced to Jane . " I should n't have shouted ecnalubma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " His hand gently rubbed her denimed knee . " Under ? No . The . . . ecnalubma screamed too loud . " " Ambulance , Jane , " he corrected happily . She needed to know her world on its own terms now . " It was just an ambulance . " He steered the van down the dark , snow-churned street until it vanished into a stream of similar vehicles . It finally nosed onto the entry ramp to Highway 100 , following the venerable north-south route until it joined Interstate 694 , then peeled off onto an east-west access road . " The wilds of Bloomington . " Kevin surveyed the brightly lit , ruler-straight channel of freeway known as the Bloomington Strip . Bloomington claimed to be Min- lh nesota 's third-largest city , but it was a heartless community . Few ever saw its downtown . Instead , its soul resided along Interstate 694 , beside a restless rhythm of passing cars and within an endless chain of upscale restaurants and singles bars , hotels and motels . An hour later , Kevin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motels , was sitting on the edge of a double bed , watching Jane sleep in the bed across from him . 11 , A strange world , he reflected , where a room for two had come to mean separate beds each big enough for two . It I implied more togetherness  --  and more apartness  --  than he suspected the species could stand , no matter how nomadic it became . i1 The clubby motel glass he held seemed to grease his palm with the lingering oils of traveling salesmen and randy football players and giggling women desperate for what passed for a good time on the Strip . But Chivas Regal slicked the inside of the glass . Why not ? he 'd thought in the liquor store while staring at the overlit rows of bottles . Why the hell not ? The McDonald 's bag lay on the bedspread beside him , bloated as a prostate patient 's bladder , only with air . 73  | He 'd forced down the cold McDonald 's burger as soon as he 'd rammed the motel room night chain home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have the energy to find the ice machine  --  trickled through him , piping a relaxation so profound down his wrangled nerves that he could almost feel blood draining from his taut arteries in slow stages . Risky , he knew . Risky to allow himself this small , calculated collapse at the lip of a glass . Risky to have registered , even under a pseudonym , at a motel . But where was he supposed to go ? What dive 's water glass would he honor with his hoarded Chivas tomorrow night ? Where would Jane lay her telekinetic head next ? " To aliens , " Kevin toasted himself in the plain-Jane mirror above the Melamine-topped dresser . " And all good alienists . " The juxtaposition soothed him , as the Scotch had not . Who was better qualified to receive an alien visitation , to guide a human with alien talents through a too-familiar world , than an alienist ? A shrink who saw his world shrinking under the enormity of one huge , artificial object in the sky over Crow Wing ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , except the raw silk whisper of the Chivas Regal he could not afford down his throat . " I told you he 'd head home ! " Nordstrom crowed . " Instincts of a lemming . The man wants to be caught , to be crucified . A Savior complex , and a textbook example , if I ever saw one . " Turner did n't answer . Instead , he tapped his fingers on the Xerox of the university campus police report atop his 74  | desk . The Chevy van had been reported at the local McDonald 's just last night . Its license plates had been described as " obscured , " but the make and model were on target . " We need his cooperation , " Turner said slowly , " we do n't need your latest techniques in search and retrieval , Dr. Nordstrom . I 've done a little backgrounding of my own . . . on you . " Nordstrom 's laugh was slightly self-deprecating . " You 're not even worried , are you ? " Turner complained . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I dug up ... " " It 's classified . All my work is . " Nordstrom 's smile hovered a whisker 's width away from a smirk . " I 'm surprised you wasted your time , Mr. Turner . I would have told you anything you needed to know . " " I wanted to know what you would n't tell me . . . or what you would n't let me read between the lines . Back at Harvard , you and Blake shared a lot of the same class rosters . " " They were large classes . " " Still , you knew him . " Nordstrom shrugged . " You knew that . Blake was one of those ingratiating fakers even crusty Harvard professors slobber over . Liberal , to a fault . Used to egg me into medical ethics debates  --  Blake was always trying to impress the impressionable . He did n't even know who I was . A most . . . disagreeable man . But it worked . I saw him win grades , win hearts and minds . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shrugging . " Not mine . " After a long pause he turned slowly to face Turner again . " I expect you to point out that I do n't have one . " " One what ? " " Heart . " Turner spun a manila folder on his desk so Nordstrom could read the typed title . " The PID is n't noted for hiring heart . I see you were involved in that CIA scam to cool off the army 's involuntary LSD guinea pigs from the sixties . " " Involved ? I invented it . " 75  | " Those flashbacks you induced sent some of those guys back to the nuthouse . " " It kept them out of government claims court , did n't it ? " " How 'd you do it ? Induce flashbacks so destructive , I mean ? Did you drop it in their brownies at a family picnic ? Spike their Sunday afternoon beers ? Even the guys ' lawyers could n't untangle what was LSD-echo and what was just plain craziness . Drove their cases out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some LSD derivative , something even I do n't know about ? " " There are more drugs on heaven and earth , Horatio , than are dreamed of in your philosophy . " " Cut the . . . quotes , Nordstrom . " Turner 's shoulders shifted uneasily . " You work for me now . The job is simple : find the psychiatrist and his patient ; persuade  --  repeat , persuade  --  the guy to work with her under our supervision . Failing that , you are to use your . . . skills , as needed ... to debrief Jane Doe herself . " That wo n't be easy . She 's part wonder-worker and part time bomb , from what slim facts we 've pieced together . Four dead men behind her , two of ' em the Crow Wing cops who found her , two of ' em mine . Even Dr. Swanson 's paranormal experiments proved to be hard-won . We do n't know exactly what Jane Doe is , and how hard it will be to find out . " Nordstrom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods . And government imperatives allow me to push the human psyche to its limits  --  my own as much as anybody 's . Everything that makes Homo sapiens civilized is useless when the ruling order requires a specific behavior . Useless to the victim , that is . Civilization has many uses for the hunter . " " Listen to me : The woman 's mind is valuable , and the man is the key to her mind . That makes him valuable , too . No need to send him home in a mental body bag unless we have to . " Nordstrom 's thumb and fingers rubbed together speculatively . " What if I produce a better key ? " " Prove it . What we do n't want  --  what nobody wants ? 76  | is to blow this woman 's abilities before we 've had a chance to evaluate them . Blake 's right about one thing : she should n't get into the wrong hands . " " Do some of those hands belong to our comrades across the sea ? " Nordstrom sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operative . A delivery boy . " Then let me congratulate you . " Nordstrom raised one eyebrow over the ground-glass rim of his spectacles . " From that report , it looks like it wo n't be long before the fugitives are in custody . Then I go to work . " Turner skimmed the page again . " We 're looking for them in Minneapolis now ; a big city makes a finer net than the boonies . You were right about him heading back here . Poor devil . " Nordstrom shrugged and flipped open a manila folder . The pen-and-ink sketch of Jane looked back at him . " Poor bitch , " he parroted softly . " Do n't underestimate her , " Turner warned . " Cracking that  --  from all reports  --  extraordinary . . . mind of hers will take skill , and maybe something Dr. Kevin Blake always had that you do n't . " Nordstrom 's face went livid . " What ? " he demanded , a higher note scratching his voice 's baritone sheen . It was Turner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jane ? " Kevin shook her shoulder . She sat up groggily in the semidark , murmuring " Dr. Neumeier ? ? " " Were you dreaming ? " " No . . . I do n't think so . But I thought I saw Dr. Neumeier ? " Jane looked to the oblong of window where highway lights gleamed faintly through the drawn curtains . " You could n't have seen her . For God 's sake , do n't have nightmares that I ca n't analyze , Jane . We 're not there anymore , in Neumeier 's cabin in the north woods . Besides , Dr. Neumeier 's dead , you know that . I told you myself just tonight . " 77  | " Then I . . . heard her . " Conviction lifted Jane 's voice to a single , repeated note . " She said that . . . They will always win . " Kevin was silent , recognizing the words of the canny old sociology professor , survivor of the Holocaust but not of the government 's right to know in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts implicit in Neumeier 's death . They , the ones " who always win , " the forces of official inquiry , must have reached Neumeier 's wilderness cabin after Jane and he had left . Then they must have interrogated her  --  too harshly , triggering a fatal coronary . Of course , Kevin himself had precipitated that by running to Neumeier in the first place , like a truant schoolboy hiding behind a favorite teacher . The lump of lifetime guilt Kevin collected somewhere at his center coiled up a few thousand more yards of secondhand string ... . Kevin made himself remember his patient . " Jane , what you overheard , that was said . . . days ago , nights ago . You 're remembering conversational odds and ends ? " " I 'm remembering , " she challenged , a smile in her voice . Now that she was fully awake and the light would n't shock her eyes , Kevin turned up the lamp on the bedside table between them . Even Edison 's genius could n't lighten the three A.M. blues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane curled up against her upholstered headboard . " You want me to remember , " she reminded him . " You remember too much . " " And not enough . " " And not enough . Jane , I want ? " Her eyes livened . " Not that . I want to put you under hypnosis again . " " Oh . " She looked disappointed , then stretched impatiently . " I liked the chair in your office better . When you hypnotize me on a bed , my neck hurts afterwards . " " Simple cure . " He tossed the pillows on his bed to Jane 's . " Get comfy ; then we 'll put you under . " " Why ? " " I thought you did n't mind hypnosis . " " No ... but there 's so much in my mind now , every-  | thing that 's happened to me since I was found . I do n't want to lose it . " " Jane , I do n't want to lose any part of you , either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . And so much is still lost . You 're a miracle , you know that ? " " They did n't think so . " " They ' ? You mean the . . . guess I better find something to call them . " Only euphemisms , cloyingly coy , surfaced in Kevin 's mind . " The , uh , visitors ? " She shook her head . " Not them . Them ! The Volkers . My . . . parents . If they thought I was a miracle , they would have wanted to keep me . Why did they have my photograph on their wall ? And why did I look so different in it  --  the same , but different ? Why do I feel . . . ? " " Feel what ? " he coached . " Feel that I do n't know what 's happening to me anymore . " " That 's not true ! " He launched himself at her bed , tired springs squawling under his weight . " You know more than ever . We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should never have taken you there . They 're your parents by virtue of sheer dumb luck more than intention . They do n't know the first thing about being parents except clinging to some illusion of a child . You 're too real for them , too demanding . " What you should want to know about is . . . those others , the visitors . The ones who took you from this earth in the form of a tiny cell twenty-five years ago and returned you as a grown woman . Do you know how many cells are in the human body ? Sixty thousand billion . All those cells , growing , changing , encapsulating the information that makes you . . . you . And some of them were adulterated ? had to be to give you the faculties , the powers you have . What about them ? The ones who made you . " " They let me go ! I remember that . " Jane was shrinking into the piled pillows , as if to cushion herself against a lingering nightmare . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why ? Why , when retrieving you and capturing all that information coursing  | along your neurons was their only purpose ? Why let you go again ? And with what attributes ? Did they . . . empty your memory of what they wanted to know , or simply copy it onto their own records ? Did they strip you of your telekinetic powers as painlessly as they stripped you of your clothes in the . . . uh . . . laser lift ? Did they give you a message to give mankind ? ? " " Humankind , " Jane corrected . Kevin waved his hand . " It 's the same thing . " " It 's not . Chauvinistic speech conventions are designed to reduce the role of women not only in history but in contemporary life as well . " He sighed his frustration . " This is hardly the moment for a women 's lib speech  --  did you get that from the nursing students ? I never should have sent you to stay with them in the dorm  --  it was like turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I . . . read that sentence . In a book . In the library . " " Then you do remember the information you .. . gleaned ! That souped-up speed reading you did at the campus library stuck . So the . . . shit ! . . . the aliens must 've left your memory intact ! That 's why I need to pull out those latent memories so you can see them for yourself , so I can understand ? " " Understand ! " She seemed panicked now . " You understand too much , and I not enough . Please , Kevin , I do n't want to lose myself again ! Never again . To let myself go like that . " " I 'll bring you back , I promise . " " You ca n't bring Dr. Neumeier back . " Kevin 's face froze as all persuasion drained from it , leaving bleak introspection . " You 're right . Neumeier 's death is my fault . If I had n't brought you to her , if we had n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be alive . " Jane leaned forward and touched his hand with her fingertip . " There are places , Kevin , that nobody can bring you back from . I do n't want to go to one of those . I 've been there before , I think , and I ca n't come back too many 80  | times . If you make me go too far inside myself again , I may not be able to leave  --  ever . " " They left you here , turned you loose , wiQh that kind of condition on it , you think ? " He sounded horrified , and he was . " Not they , " Jane said gently . " You . " Her eyes radiated an awful honesty . Kevin searched himself , wondering who was the amnesiac , who the probe , who the tool of others ' wishes . " Maybe you should hypnotize me , " he joked , gift-wrapping anxiety in humor . Such defense mechanisms were alien to Jane . Silent , she watched him , the lamplight carving delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower lip , changing her  --  again  --  into something Kevin did not quite know . His hand lighted on her hair . " I do n't know how much time we 'll have left to . . . work . There are things I need to know  --  for your sake as well as my own stubborn , selfserving curiosity . I wo n't . . . lose you . Not this time , not ever . Trust me . " She nodded soberly . He segued quickly into the hypnotic ritual before she could change her mysterious mind . He told her that she was relaxed , that she was safe , that she would be all right . And then he whispered the word . Ecnalubma . Jane went under like a perfect pupil , into perfect peace . Kevin envied her that induced serenity for an instant before he kicked his professional mindset into gear and began asking his questions . Then he began listening . And watching . 81  | At three o'clock in the morning , Nordstrom was staring at a Milky Way of stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suite window along the Bloomington Strip . He savored his position of height , of aloofness , a habit of his New York City upbringing . He liked the night and its anonymity  --  that , too , a residue of urban jungle infighting . This flat , open suburban wasteland , with its hints of cold vastness lurking just beyond the last snake of illuminated freeway , repelled him . Of course , the January cold  --  the primitive January cold  --  justified his fur-lined storm coat more than any piddling snowfall that could swirl into the glass canyons of Manhattan . Nordstrom had tossed the coat on an overstuffed chair , open lining fur-side out . He paused , vodka glass in hand , to admire the mink 's rusty black sheen in the incandescent lamplight . That 's how Nordstrom liked to wear his status symbols ? close to the vest . Concealed . A teasing presence that tantalized the less blessed . He eyed the manila folders sprawled across the king-size bed , adding a random pattern to the bedspread 's neat geometric print . Nordstrom liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone else 's mental order . Now the subject of his disorder was Kevin Blake . Where was he ? Nordstrom mused deliciously at the window . Someplace warm and comfortable , like this ? At peace with the thought of new work about to begin ? 82  | No , Blake would be out of his element  --  in the dark and the cold , in whatever corner of it he could buy , beg or steal . He would be desperate to belong again to the common herd of the law-abiding . He was a herd animal who did n't know it , Nordstrom thought , cut loose by circumstances from the security of the mindless masses . Blake would bolt , would run himself into the ground and would give up , sniveling , ultimately . Then Nordstrom would go to work . He anticipated matching wits with a fellow psychiatrist , he admitted to himself . Particularly this one . His knuckles whitened on the glass with its bloodless white liquid . Odd that it should come down to this , he and Blake , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own life from birth . With his first breath , wealth and its expectations were his . Unfortunately , he never grew beyond that first gangling adolescent spurt that promises much more . He never outgrew his infant unattractiveness  --  too much head and eyes . Eventually , there came the teeth , also too much , despite the costly machinations of a Park Avenue orthodontist . So despite the money , Eric Nordstrom grew into the kind of ill-assembled man on whom trousers always sagged and custom-tailored shirts invariably wrinkled , and whose high-priced 57th Street haircuts immediately turned into something Walter Mondale would sport . Such details had not bothered his obsessively intelligent mind , though he recognized them with a kind of icy dislike . He had been a solitary , driven child  --  more adult than most of the grown-ups around him . He had n't minded until Harvard . And Julie Symons . Nordstrom sipped his vodka and changed hands on the glass to warm one and cool the other . Julie Symons 's father was a top cosmetic surgeon , her mother begotten in money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First they begot Julie , a tall , fragile girl with the darting shyness of a hummingbird . Tall . Nordstrom even hated the look of the word . But 83  | Julie had spoken to him , as if Eric Nordstrom were n't a worm who 'd oozed up onto the sidewalk into her path . Julie Symons  --  a born dancer with the kind of brownette coloring that looked exquisite in pink , and Nordstrom hated pink . She was dead now . Nordstrom went to the bed , flipping open the strewn folders , one by one , until the photograph of Kevin Blake jumped into his vision . Julie had spoken to Eric Nordstrom . But she had screwed Kevin Blake . Filthy . The phone rang  --  not an abrupt , old-fashioned buzz , but an up-to-date electronic two-note wail . Nordstrom , expecting it , took his time answering . He checked the crocodilebanded Piaget under his French cuff before lifting the receiver . Eight-fifteen exactly , as arranged . " You required a consultation ? " the voice demanded without preamble . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garbled , that the call itself was scrambled . In nine years , Nordstrom had saluted five different voices with the receiver and had never known the name of one of them , other than a terse code word . He used the latest silly monicker now . " Overseer ? " " Affirmative . You requested contact . What is your situation ? You are not to contact Overseer unless it 's an emergency . " " It is . The local authorities are n't helping catch the fugitives ? " " That 's usual . We do n't want them to get too curious . Our agents will find the subjects . " " That 's just it . Your agents  --  agent  --  may have a stake in not finding them . " " You mean Turner ? " " Turner , and maybe others . But Turner 's the  --  key . I think his . . . heart . . . is n't in this . He 's gone soft . He found out about assignment Angel Dust . " " It 's possible he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " It 's his attitude . He does n't want to catch this pair . He 's . . . protective of them . " " So are we . In our way . " " He 's got it all wrong . He wants the psychiatrist and the woman handled with kid gloves . That treatment will never break down the doctor-patient relationship . He wants me to waste time trying to convert Blake to our side . " I say , forget him ! Get to her ; she 's the vulnerable one . Blake 'll never help . He 's a fringe type  --  liberal big mouth . He 'll scream civil liberties so loud it 'll raise the dead . I went to school with him . I know . The guy 's practically a fucking Commie . Turner 's . . . insane to think we can work with him . " " You can do wonders with anyone . " " Not if your men wo n't let me . " " Anyone else besides Turner oppose you ? " " Not . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best alone , with a blank check . Everybody in this iceberg town could screw up this operation . They 're unsophisticated hicks when it comes to a sensitive operation . I need complete authority ? " " You 've always worked through channels . " " Channels will bury us this time ! I need control . Otherwise , I wo n't be responsible . You think this is your usual drip-dry brainwash job ? Hell , no . These things have to be handled delicately . Turner , whatever his problem , wants to wade right in and hack around . " Trust me . I know my man  --  and I will know my woman . Give me carte blanche and then watch the telekinetic toasters fly . I 'll give you some stuff that 'll really curl your oak leaves ? " Silence on the phone , not even the sound of breathing . For one panicked , gasping moment , Nordstrom wondered if he 'd been cut off  --  if he 'd never been speaking to anyone at all  --  or if it was all a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll consider your request . " A dial tone hummed into Nordstrom 's ear , faintly dismissive . He hung up as slowly as he had answered and  | returned to the bed . Kevin Blake 's face still lay grinning up at him with that too-too Freudian beard and that public relations smile . Nordstrom remembered watching with sour , envious satisfaction as Blake had watched Julie inexorably succumb to anorexia nervosa . That 's when Blake 's post  --  med school specialty had firmed , surprising all but Nordstrom , who had watched . Psychiatry . That 's when Nordstrom had declared his own specialty . Also psychiatry . Oh , nobody knew about his secret fixation . He had n't even gone to the funeral . Fiancee , that 's what Julie was to Blake , officially , but everybody knew that old man Symons had no patience for Julie 's infatuation with a penniless nobody . Fiancee . That was frozen in time now , that travesty , with Julie . Nordstrom 's eyes narrowed . A closed coffin . That 's what the fine-print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what the visitation delivered to all corners , including the great Dr. Blake . Even then , Nordstrom had his ways . He was a medical student , after all , and he was obsessed . He got into the mortuary , his palms sweating as he anticipated his pretext crumbling under the first question . But no one cared ; no one asked . Maybe he looked like a funeral director . He saw her , as Kevin Blake never had , dressed in something pink and soft that sank into the exposed cradle of her bones like rotting flesh already . They 'd done her up completely , probably for old lady Symons  --  the hollow , painted face , elegant as an ivory skull polished here and there with fever ; the buffed fingernails and sculpted hands ; the carefully done hair wearing a permanence of form it never aspired to in life . At first it enraged him , the notion of anonymous fingers handling Julie 's paper-thin form so intimately . The final indignity , the cliche went , and everyone touching her but him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He began to imagine himself with the sharp-pointed shears and the hair spray , himself arranging and manipulating the clothes , the limbs . 86  | In that roomful of closed coffins , he stared at Julie Symons laid like a princess on a cream-colored satin bed and then kissed her thin , painted lips . They were quite , quite cold . Nordstrom stared down at the tasteful hotel bedspread , his heart hammering . Kevin Blake smiled up at him , the bastard ! Nordstrom 's trembling hand flipped the photo into the dark of the folder . He opened the last blank manila file , the one with the pathetically few papers and the sketch of another darkhaired woman . Jane Doe . His lips curled as his mind pronounced the lumpish nonname . Another nobody , just like Kevin Blake , he decided . But unlike Julie , alive . And Kevin Blake cared about this one , too , or he would n't be playing fugitive from one godforsaken end of Minnesota to the other . Nordstrom smiled into his vodka . Blake , unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet somehow in school , Blake and Nordstrom always ended up on opposite sides . They had again , only this time Nordstrom ran the class and established the rules . This time , Nordstrom would win . Jane felt herself lifted off the earth  --  her body hovering as high and light as thin air . No . . . . Her mind refined the impression . She was actually sinking  --  so deep it made her feel she occupied another altitude . Whether high or low , she always felt light when Kevin hypnotized her . She was n't one to imagine things  --  her alien upbringing had stunted that facility ? but at times like this , Jane fancied she felt like a dolphin 87  | cruising far below sun-dappled waves , making intelligent blips in the depths . Kevin 's voice came to her , a lifeline of bubble-garbled rumble she somehow understood ; she followed its wavering filaments through the fathoms of her weightlessness . " I might as well get the lurid stuff over with first . Tell me about the visitors , Jane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanding as inquiring , not so much to be obeyed as to be pleased . " Tell me what happened when their light beam lifted you into their ship . I saw you assumed into their presence , like some undressed saint . You must have seen them . Inside the ship . What were they  --  are they ? like ? " Jane swiveled ponderously amid the aquamarine murk of her awareness , the psychic shift tattooing sensation across her memory like fanning seaweed . " Snow angels , " she finally said . " Snow angels . " A long silence swirled around her . In another state , Jane had learned to anticipate , to read , to react to the tone of that voice . She would explain . Or defend . Or deny . Here , nothing was required but the slow , sure drag of memory along the foggy bottom of her internal sea . " Snow angels , " Jane repeated dreamily . " I like the look of snow , but it 's cold . They  --  those beings , my keepers ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cold but light . They sparkled as their mind turned . It would be easy to sink into them  --  down , down upon the table , under the bright beam above , floating on them , drifting through the stars with them , seed and sowing bound together , mindless , memoryless . " They made not-being seem better . Normal . Others drifted in their care , as I must have , too , orphans of other worlds . Unplugged , that is what we were in that state . Disconnected . Prongs no longer probing to the center but drawn away . Untouching . " What were they like ? They were like mist in the mind . I felt them moving upon my memory  --  cold , white steps that sank into nothingness . Lifting here , sinking there . Leaving no traces . Footless footprints . They melt away .  | They leave me melted . That is what they 're like . Like melted snow angels . " " Okay . " The word 's bluntness somehow did n't shatter Jane 's reverie . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Project Blue Book along with the other wacko entries ... . Did you get a chance to . . . communicate with them ? " " Oh , yes . They spoke English . They had plugged the words into me to begin with . I spoke to one and all . I . . . argued for maintaining my me-ness . Some . . . one listened . So I was returned , the ground cold on my feet , but me not caring . No one caring but Kevin , who bought me Zyunsinth and brought me Zyunsinth again , and then buried Zyunsinth ? ! " " Jane , hush . It had to be . That coat is n't Zyunsinth , only the memory of Zyunsinth . Zyunsinth are the people .. . creatures . . . of another world like ours . Did your  --  they ? say why they released you ? Once they removed the information you had gained by living among us , once you were empty again , surely they planned to take you away and leave you to gather data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what they planned . They were .. . intrigued by my me-ness . They seemed like doctors . " " Doctors ? " " All gathered around in white , looking and asking but not seeing or telling . I was returned . They did n't say why . I did n't ask . I was not aware until I stood on the bluff and knew that I was outside the homeplace , that I was no longer on the scanning table ? " " They . . . operated on you ? " " What is operated ' ? They asked me to put myself in their control again . " " Did you ? " The voice grated with concern . " I . . . do n't remember . I stood before them and asked for myself back . Then I stood in the dark and the cold ? and they were only faceless metal hovering over me and a pitiless eye of light . Snow angels . Light and cold , fleeting but eternal . Unforgiving . " " Did they have hands , feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned slitted eyes . " Jane felt her head nod as slowly as a manatee 's bumping 88 89  | noses with an underwater rock . " All that . They had all that . They were like us , but different . Different among themselves . But the same . As we are . I . . . I did not belong with them . " " Of course not ! You belong here . You were human conceived , if not reared . And now you 've lived among your own kind for several months . " Kevin 's voice was swelling into a distant roar , as it often did when it feared the undertow would take her . Jane remained serene , drifting beneath a latticework of light and shadow , skimming along the fibers of her own nervous system , hearing herself humming . " Jane . Jane ! " " Yes ? " " Not so . . . deep . Remember , you 're here with me in the motel room , that 's all . " " There 's more here than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of panic thickened the voice . Jane made her own words calm , calming . " Memory . Memory we have with us always . " Quiet filtered through the opaque current of memory . A long quiet . Then , words again . " All right . Let 's go back before the bluff top . Before the aliens came to retrieve you . Let 's go back to the woods between Dr. Neumeier 's cabin and Duluth . Let 's remember when the cars had the van sandwiched between them on Highway 61 , and I turned onto the side road . Then I drove the van into the drifts until it stopped and got out , leaving you in the front seat ? " Jane felt seaweed coil her limbs , sensed a sudden smothering immensity to the water around her . Tendrils of her breath wreathed the coral , coiling into a shape like DNA . She climbed the double helix like a diver scaling an umbilical cord of air to the surface . Shadowy shapes buffeted her . She no longer breathed . Her senses darkened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . The DNA spirals  --  half coral and half medical textbook drawing , both impressions superimposed on each other by her retentive , image-scavenging mind  --  grew faces and  | elongated into flames . She felt no heat , only herself dwindling into the depths far below her and the click of her altered cells reorganizing her body until she seemed to be one raging , singing autonomous cell that gathered and gave back " Jane ! " The word came swinging down toward her like a vine , offering an alternative safety . " Jane , relax ! Nothing is hurting you . You 're safe ? " " No ! " Her own voice sprayed air into the water all around her , surrounding her and the DNA in a snowstorm of bubbles . " I am hurting something ! Too close , they come too close . I must guard what I have gleaned . It will not be permitted for my self to be compromised  --  self must survive for the gleaning 's sake . I see now ! The other power speaks from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into neutrons and electrons trapped in boxes . My body makes them dance , the bits of being , so fast that they burn , they boil , they . . . expire . The machine wraps itself in its own shroud of suicidal particles and rolls away , far away , down into the dark . " " That 's not the woods ! That 's Matusek , Jane ! You 're reliving Matusek 's squad car blowing up and rolling off the Crow Wing bluff the night he found you . You caused that , did n't you , Jane ? " " Jane ? Jane was not Jane then . " " No , you had n't been officially tagged a Jane Doe quite yet , but , Christ , even if it was some defensive mechanism the aliens had genetically engineered into you  --  Matusek was just a country cop . He was calling for an ambulance , why blast him ? " " The machine . . . competes . " " The squad car radio ? That explains the tape recorders you got into telekinetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household appliances ? God , when they program a glitch , your snow angels do a damn good job of it . Wait . Rest now . Let me . . . Just calm down . You . And me . " Jane waited , dangling in half water , half air . Breathing 91  | both . She remembered the holding tank and drifting in its artificial atmosphere . She remembered the chill familiarity of half-being . Kevin 's voice came again in the old lulling singsong . " What about Kellehay ? " " Kellehay ? " " The other cop who found you that August night . The man who was with you when Matusek died , who rode back with you in the am  --  in the ecnalubma . . . to the hospital in Minneapolis . The young guy who died  --  the day after . " Jane felt her head shake leadenly , felt a warm grasp on her wet , chilled forearm . It threatened her grip on the DNA rope ladder . " Jane , you must remember ! My God , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the way the glass cut him  --  and you were semiconscious by then . " " Someone came , " she remembered unhappily , her mind twisting , twisting to elude the images that came flashing up the rope . " At night . Alone . He . . . talked a lot . To himself , I think . He pressed the pillow over my mouth and pushed me down , down . . . down again ? " Jane gasped as she felt her self slip and spiral down the endless filaments ... . " There was , there was . . . that within me then that would not allow my existence to end . The cells bring forth . The cells repel . He fell back , but came again , I think . I 'm not sure . He came so close , and the I of me was so far away . He pushed , and was pushed away . From me . Toward himself . His self poked a hole in the night and went shattering into sharp little pieces . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all have names . We just do n't know them sometimes . " Jane cocked her head to the deep resignation in Kevin 's voice . She pulled herself up along the DNA rope again , listening . " Then it was self-defense , at least , " he was saying , more to himself than to her . She could barely comprehend his words . " Kellehay had cracked , not hard to see why . He 'd seen your built-in . . . defenses . . . kill his partner , but no 92  | one would listen when he said you were dangerous , especially his shrink for a day . Chalk up another one for the whiz kid . . . . All right . " A sigh of air brushed Jane 's cheek . Her consciousness sensed a new location . She seemed to be floating now , on the surface , twined in weedy chains of DNA . " All right , " Kevin repeated . His voice no longer bubbled with distortion , as if he , too , had come back from someplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods I asked you about in the first place . It 's night . Dark . I 've left you in the van to see what the men in the car behind us want . I guess I know . They 're after you  --  government errand boys out to deliver one missing piece of merchandise . . . slightly reused in a few other worlds , but your basic telekinetic human model , after all . " And I do my Custer 's Last Stand bit , and the two guys pretty much cream me . They 're pros . My head makes a good gong on the van doors . I wake up in the snow to find their car torched , the guys spread like . . . like goddamn strips of Sizzlean over the hood . How did that happen , Jane ? Are you some preprogrammable Rambo ? Did your built-in defenses take over again ? This is the one they 'll burn us for . What the hell happened ? " She turned her head too quickly . It hit something she could n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the water . An oblong black box that did n't mean anything to her . " Do n't fade on me now , " Kevin 's voice urged . " I know it hurts . It hurts me , too . That 's the price of being human . Be human now . Tell me ! Tell me how  --  why  --  you killed those two men . " Jane 's hands clenched on masses of soggy DNA , wringing them taut . The bright blue balls that formed it floated alongside , buoying her . " Remember , Jane . You can remember anything you want to if you try hard enough . Try ! It 's important . I have to know why you did it . I think I know why you forgot it  --  the first thing that happened to you in your own world that you blocked out . I think you do n't want to be a killing machine anymore . You want to take your risks like the rest 93  | of us . Maybe the aliens disarmed you when they let you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore . It 's not your fault . It 's never been your fault . But I have to know . Tell me , please ? " She sighed , and let the weeds enfold her , let herself float on their surrounding mass . From far above , a spotlight of sunshine dissected her in its rays . Her skin seemed pinned back . Exposed , her memory expanded like a ripe melon in the sun . At its exact center , white and dead and cold , a scene was tacked to her inner eye : the drilling yellow headlight eyes of the idling car behind the van ; two hulking figures black against the light . As she saw , she spoke , feeling her lips move , but hearing nothing . Seeing only , Jane moved into her memory . She saw the black of night held back only by a dark fence of bare trees . The humpbacked silhouette of the car . The men waddling through the snowdrifts toward her . And there , another midnight spot  --  the lump of Kevin collapsed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gone , she thought . Thought became feeling . They came toward her , the two vague figures , came to take her  --  again  --  to somewhere else . Came to rend her memory from her  --  again  --  and give it to something else . Some machine . Came to take Kevin , who was so quiet and still , almost as still as the woods and the night . Were these men those who had a right to take ? For a moment she was confused . And then she heard Kevin 's voice and he seemed to be saying that no one  --  no one at all  --  had a right to take . . . to take her . To take him . To take anyone against their I-ness . And so she stood there half-blinded by the headlights but seeing more efficiently than ever before . She remained , even as the defensive forces bunched in her body , leaving her little room . She remained this time , and decided . When the men came close enough to touch her , touch him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fringes of her mind , and gathered her awesome energy into a finehoned flare of power . It seized her and flowed through her and spit out from 94  | her in breath and the heat of being , wind and fire propelling , repelling . She saw  --  this time she saw , clearly  --  how her internal energies consumed the men . She saw their thick winterwear crackle and vanish , heard bone crunching on metal , smelled ash and flesh in the clearing . When it was still , she looked to the form at her feet . It remained as motionless as the others . Emotion opened up its empty lungs and screamed . Memory would look no further . Jane released the rope , plunging down through every element within her , as she had then turned and fled into the endless winter woods . At last the defensive programming found an opening and rushed inward to flood and uphold the organism , to crush a cold compress of forgetfulness over the inner eyes . Jane sank into her self , and the survival instincts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The recaptured moments of consciously wielded power turned screwlike in her brain , slowly seating themselves . She felt herself sink again , under the weight of too many memories . Kevin , she thought , might call it humanity , but she was not sure she could claim that condition . " Jane . I 'm bringing you out . Now ! Hang on . Just listen to my voice . When I count to three , you 'll be in your normal consciousness . You 'll be back . One . " She was leagues deep by then , spinning into seclusion . " You 're coming up . Hang on ! Two . For God 's sake , Jane  --  three ! Three . " Three . The word hung between two worlds , between inhale and exhale . Between then and now . " Jane . . . ? " Something shook her , bubbles bursting and propelling her to the surface again . She sputtered , blinked her eyes to rid them of water . . . . She opened them to utter dryness , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue of Kevin 's eyes and mistook them for sky . His expression clouded . He shook her again , desperately . " Jane ? Okay ? " Her tongue wet her lips . 95  | " You should remember everything now . I can make you forget if it 's too painful ? " " No ! " This time the drowning panic beat along her pulses . " If I forget what hurts , how will I remember what does n't ? " His anxious face sagged into relief . He drew her hard into his arms . " Welcome to the human race , " he said , laughing and not laughing . Over his shoulder , Jane regarded the closed curtains of the window . " I 'm not very . . . human , am I ? " Kevin laughed again , ruefully , pushing her away to stare into her face . " No , but you 're getting better . Or should I say , worse . I understand now . Your genes were programmed to defend you without discrimination . You killed Matusek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " When Kellehay came to your hospital room , he was attacking you . Your powers automatically pushed him out the window when he became lethal , but you were already developing a sense of good and bad , of necessity and impulse . You knew on a subconscious level that you had to use the powers . You were defending yourself against a real attacker , God help the poor fool . And that night in the woods , with the two government men ? " She looked away , lost again in an elliptical orbit around herself . " Jane , look at me . " Kevin pulled hard on all the easycome-by persuasion in him . Jane had to see that herself and her acts were justified . So did he . " That 's what bothered me most , " he admitted . " The cold-blooded way you torched those men , bad guys or not . The way you forgot it again . It smelled of regression . Only , now I see . . . it 's progression ! " You were defending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what set you off . You thought I was dead . So instead of fading and letting reflex take over , you controlled your powers to defend someone else as well as yourself . Me . You 're beginning to know better . I only hope they do n't hang you for being what you were made to be . " " Hang , " Jane repeated . " To fasten from above with no 96  | support from below . ' That 's how I feel when you hypnotize me . That 's how I felt when they . . . kept me dormant . " " Do n't try your dictionary declensions on hanging , ' Jane . Here 's the best application of the word : somethingsomeone  --  to hang onto . Let 's you and me hang onto each other . Sanity can wait . " " Was I wrong ? " she asked , her mouth muffled against his neck . " About what ? " " To let . . . it . . . take those men ? " " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want them to get you . " Kevin pushed her away to look hard into her eyes . " If the men come again , if they get me  --  do n't think about anything . I can take care of myself . You just . . . run . Get away from me fast . Use what you have to stay free , to stay yourself . I wish your powers came in a sliding scale , with something this side of lethal , but do n't feel guilty about what you are , were . " You 're so lucky . You were born free , guiltless . No original sin on your soul . If you only knew how the theys in our world can use you with guilt ! That 's the real original sin . I bet that 's something your aliens have n't even begun to learn from us yet ... . " So promise me . From now on , it 's Jane first . Jane free . " She nodded , as Jane always did , very seriously . " Son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motel mirror . Blood welled profusely from the jagged nick his so-called safety razor had gouged in his neck about two whiskers away from his jugular vein . He stopped the flow with a corner torn from the in-wall 97  | Kleenex dispenser , which seemed incapable of disgorging an entire sheet at one tug , and swore again . Behind him in the mirror , Jane 's face popped into view . " I liked your beard better , " she commented with customary  --  and at the moment irritating  --  dispassion . " So did I , but any photos of me the police care to circulate are bound to be bearded . " Something occurred to him and his eyes netted hers in the mirror . " Did they show any facial hair  --  your aliens ? " " They are not mine . If anything , I am theirs . And no , they did n't , not at all ? ! " Her eyes lit up . " Kevin , do you realize ? Since you hypnotized me , I can remember my last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be shy . The improbable is hard to articulate ; the impossible should be easy . Spit it out : the spaceship . Star cruiser . Pick up any paperback space opera at the bookstore . Some inventive brain has thought up something different to call an interstellar vessel . Be imaginative . " " The ... ship , " Jane decided upon demurely . " And they had no hair . " " Not even on their heads ? " " No . . . but maybe they were wearing . . . caps . " Jane frowned as she boosted herself atop the sink cabinet beside him . " I really did n't pay much attention . Why are you laughing ? " " God , what the government , the people at SETI , what Chariots of the Gods addicts would give their red corpuscles to know , you did n't pay attention to ! I hope they goddamn catch us ! It would almost be worth it to have a front seat at the government think-tankers trying to debrief you .... " Jane reached out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with a new piece . " When the student nurses taught me to shave my legs , I cut myself . Once . " " Never again ? " " No . I learned how to avoid it . It 's very simple , if you know how . Why do so many humans do things that make them bleed ? " " First of all , not every human is a klutz . Second , a little bleeding does us good . Reminds us we 're vulnerable . 98  | Third , our kind is basically inconsistent , which you 'll discover when you spend more time with real people . " " You are n't real ? " " Yes , but . . . we 've been existing in a pressure cooker , Jane . You 've been thrust from one abnormal environment into another  --  hospital , university dormitory , motel rooms . Someday , I hope , you 'll get a chance to lead a normal life  --  to sleep in the same bed night after night , buy a Coney Island , read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't know what any of that is , except for the bed . " " That 's okay . It 's basically unimportant stuff that becomes important when you ca n't have it anymore , that 's all . " Jane pensively leaned her head on Kevin 's shoulder . He froze as if upholding something ponderously fragile . " Kevin , will you ever stop having to know about me ? " " No . " He wished sometimes he could . " It 's my job , my nature . And you were made to be demystified . " " Sometimes I wish ? " " Wishes are the stuff of humanity , Jane , " he teased , uneasy at the plaintive note in her voice . " Watch out or some Blue Fairy will pop out from behind the shower curtain and you 'll become a real girl in no time . " " Ah . " She glittered with knowledge received , recognized and catalogued . " That 's from Pinocchio . I could do that , " she added . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention . Jane wore only her thermal underwear . Kevin , responding to their loose but long embrace , began pressing her closer , losing himself in her scent and accommodating softness ... . " The thing with the nose . " The moment was definitely gone . " What ! ? " " It would take time , of course . " Jane examined the ceiling to consider . " Maybe . . . overnight . But I do n't think it would happen only if I lied . I could do it even when I told the truth . " " You always tell the truth . " hi  | " Yes , but I might need to lie if they catch us . Maybe I should practice . " " Jane ! " " You did n't like it when I made my fingernails grow overnight , though . " Reconsideration made her mournful . " You probably would n't like a longer nose , either . " " For God 's sake . I do n't know whether to laugh or commit hara-kiri . Jane , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't that I did n't .. . admire . . . your , uh , talent . What I really did n't like about your telescopic talons was that they proved the incontestable . . . otherness of you . " " You do n't like me ! " " No , I do . I 'm beginning to like you almost as much as I love you , which puts me in real trouble . I had forgotten that fingernail incident . I guess you could alter your nose , if you set your inalienable mind to it , but I wish you would n't . I like it the way it is . And I 'm confused enough as it is . " He finished by pecking the tip of her nose . Jane giggled , then plucked the tissue off his neck . He winced as the now-caked blood pulled away a bit of epidermis . " I 'm glad I do n't have to shave my face , " Jane said . " Me , too . " Kevin busied himself rinsing off the razor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms were clean of any trace when they left . Jane 's fingers toyed along his forearms , riffling through the curling hairs ; sometimes he felt that he was merely a Zyunsinth substitute  --  furry little humanoids , they must have been . Give Jane a blow-up King Kong and she 'd probably be equally content . " If they wo n't find us because you did have a beard , " she was ruminating idly , " and do n't have one now , maybe I should grow a beard as a disguise . " He turned . Because she sat atop the sink cabinet , their faces were on the same level . Her eyes , as usual , were quite serious . " You . . . could . . . really do that , could n't you ? " Jane nodded . " You 're making me remember , Kevin , not  | only what , but how . I do n't think I was ever meant to know these things . I was made to glean , to store , to release . But never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingertips to her cheek , drew his thumb against the grain of the almost-invisible downy hairs at her jawline . Every woman , even the fairest haired , hid a shadow of the man in her , and vice versa . In fact , maleness itself was a piece of inborn genetic engineering  --  an intrauterine modification performed upon the wholly female fetus every human being begins as . " I suppose the blueprint is there , " he admitted . " It 's merely a matter of adjusting the hormones . You 're trying to tell me something that I do n't want to see , are n't you , Jane ? You 're telling me that . . . they did n't just make you different . When they released you again on the Crow Wing bluff as an independent being , they opened the gates to your learning to manipulate yourself . " " Not them , Kevin . You . " He stiffened . " You keep saying that ! They made you , not me . " " You are unmaking me , Kevin . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You like it , too ! " he countercharged , horrified by the implications he saw yawning before him . " Oh , yes . It is very pleasant . But I learned that , how to do it whenever I wanted to , from the library books . I do n't know why so many women have difficulty ; it 's all in the books and so simple . . . like growing fingernails . I learned it before I knew what it felt like because I wanted you to . . . like me . " " God . " He pushed her hands away . A tic spasmed underneath his eye . " You make me feel like some Svengali , some cheap tin manipulator . Jane , I always wanted you to be what you could be , not what I needed you to be . Never that . Better you 'd gone with them . " " Maybe , " she said , looking into the mirror yet seeing neither of them . " But now I need you so that I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be what you need . " He shook his head . " Give me a break ; that 's what I need . You 'll confound ' em in the temple , believe me . Look , we  | got ta blow this joint . We 'll talk the metaphysics of being another time . " " Okay . " She hopped off the countertop , unannoyed . They dressed in placid silence in the other room . Jane seemed over her whimsical impulse to grow a beard . Kevin smiled as he picked up his watch from the nightstand and slid it on his wrist , putting himself back into the time stream , armoring himself to think like a fugitive . The timepiece 's rich gold glinted a reminder of the life he 'd left  --  not wealthy , but well enough off compared to being on the run . The watch also , belatedly , reminded him of his parents , whose extraordinary gift it had been on his graduation from med school . His dad had never owned more than a Timex , and his mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient Lady Elgin with a tiny low-grade ruby inset into the winding stem ... . Bearded ladies and gold watches . . . Kevin caught himself ; he was getting wacko  --  should retire from the shrink game permanently . It might be a forced retirement . " If I had some of that , " said a fully dressed Jane , " I would buy you a new razor . " " Thanks for the thought . " Kevin glanced at the shrinking roll of hundred-dollar bills he was about to stuff in his wallet . Jane reached for a bill and he handed her one . " If " ? she looked up eloquently ? " if they did n't know better , they might think these were the most vital life form here . Everyone guards them so carefully . Can I have one ? " " Not on your life . It 's dangerous to have something everybody else wants  --  and you already have a head start on that score , my Lady Jane . I 'll keep it . Less chance of losing it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to live dangerously and try ? " Kevin pulled the tattered business card Kandy had given him from his jacket pocket . " Try being James Anderson ' for a day and get some of my old money out of the new bank . Jim Anderson ' ? God , that 's Father Knows Best ! Trust Kandy to go for some crazy juxtaposition . " " What 's Father Knows Best ? " Jane asked dutifully as she trotted out the motel room behind him . 102  | " History , my dear , " Kevin said , letting the heavy door slam shut . " Ancient history . " * Daylight is never so relentless as on a white-washed winter day . The flat off-white ground and sky joined forces to glare at Kevin . He wished for sunglasses , then decided they were n't important enough to risk discovery by buying . So many little things in life seemed hopelessly distant now . He supposed he should dump the van and find some other wheels , but the enormity of buying  --  stealing ? Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . you , steal a car ? You 'd leave a trail a mile wide  --  the enormity of changing vehicles confounded him . The nice part about the van , and maybe the only nice part , was its very blandness . At first glance it looked like a delivery truck  --  bakery or diaper service , name your cover . Dirty melting snow had spattered the wheel wells and added a chic black-dotted veil to the adulterated license plates , further obscuring them . Nobody 'd look twice at the van . Kevin ducked to face himself in the side mirror before mounting the front seat . Nobody 'd look twice at him now , either , he thought , a little miffed by how easy it was to become a complete nonentity when one 's usual props were stripped away . And Jane . . . he smiled at her across the way . In her standard winter duds , she looked a hundred percent , apple pie , Minnesota-wholesome normal , God bless her rosy cheeks . Maybe they would make it , he thought . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kevin cased the Upper Midwest Savings &; Loan building from the parked van , feeling like Clyde Barrow in a lifted Ford . He 'd gone in and out of banks a hundred times without even noticing the obligatory guard stationed near the main doors , but now the guy with the holstered gun looked seven feet tall . Retired guys , potbellied and farsighted , that 's who they got for bank guards , he reassured himself . " Is that where the money is ? " his Bonnie asked with utter innocence . " Yup . " " They need a big place for it . " " All that room is for the people who watch the money . Now listen , when we go in , stick with me . Do n't look at anybody , do n't talk to anybody . And if anything goes wrong ? " " Wrong ? " " If an alarm goes off , or the guard comes running , or the cashier hits me in the face with a lemon meringue pie .... " Jane absorbed all his worst-case scenarios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If anything seems wrong  --  just get away from me . Do n't get caught . " " It would be like going back to them ? " " Worse . The aliens would only take your memory ; these geeks would rip out your soul . " " A soul does n't exist . " " Yeah , it does , only it 's a little hard to pin down . " " Like a memory ? " " Exactly like a memory . " Kevin cracked the van door , checked for oncoming 104  | traffic and slid out . The street squeezed dirty slush up to his anklebones . He squeegeed around the van to let Jane out and together they walked up the badly shoveled sidewalk . Where the S &L; building began , the snow miraculously vanished , revealing only wet concrete sidewalk . " Something must have landed here , " Jane speculated . " Yeah . Under-sidewalk heating . Old Upper Midwest S &L; must be doing all right . " Kevin took her arm , although there was no danger of slipping now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous ; it 's my fucking money .... " People brushed past in the noon-hour rush . Good cover , Kevin congratulated himself . He glanced back at the van . It looked as legitimate as any other vehicle drawn up to the row of parking meters , lined up like dull silver soldiers to infinity . . . . Parking meters , holy shit ! " Jane ! Wait here ! Do n't move . " Kevin parked her against the institution 's windows and sprinted back to the van , clawing for change in his jeans . Some criminal mind , he jibed himself . . . planning to snatch his worldly funds from under the feds ' noses and he forgets to plug the friggin ' parking meter ? ! He tore off and jammed the hampering gloves inside his jacket . His bare fingers instantly stiffened in the wind chill . Only nickels and dimes and pennies squeezed out of his jeans pockets . For want of a quarter . . . He finally found one and crammed it into the meter slot . The red line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What if something went wrong ? A nickel made it twenty-five . Reassured , he could afford to worry again about something else . Jane ! He whirled , his eyes paging back to where he 'd parked her  --  right behind the bus stop sign . . . gone . Gone . Ohmigod . . . . Should have dragged her along , even if it made a spectacle , should 've something ! Kevin started back up the street , his eyes raking passing figures like a pickpocket 's . Everybody wore down jackets . All the women were dark-haired and just-so tall . He crammed cold hands into jacket pockets to hide his fists and lurched toward the S &L's; grandiose glass entry . Maybe she 'd gone in to get out of the cold . 105  | A fat man in a furred Russian hat stepped into his path as a bus arrived . Kevin smelled diesel fumes swirling behind him , heard the brakes grind . Even now Jane could be stepping up the black rubberized stairs , wandering God knows where , whisked away as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aliens ... . The fat man tried to belly-brush Kevin aside . Kevin turned , savage . " Watch the hell where you 're going ? ! " At the bank 's window-wall , obscured by the fat man until he had moved , Jane was standing with her nose pressed against plate glass . Kevin joined her , anger still flaring under his relief . " I told you to stay where I left you . " " Some people came and pushed me down . " He glanced along the stone-and-glass facade . Waiting bus riders were strung out like birds on a wire , each hugging the debatable shelter of the building 's skirts . Jane had been edged three windows down . He squeezed her arm . " Sorry . Guess I panicked . What 's so fascinating inside ? " " Them . " Kevin looked , feeling foolish . A hallmark of urban sophistication was being able to walk by everything without noticing anything . The S &L's; first floor was carpeted in Kelly green . Walnut-veneer desks at regular intervals , each wearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a giant hound's-tooth pattern on the vivid background . Crisply feminine workers  --  all young , impeccably groomed , skirted and bloused and bowed at the collar or dripping tasteful gobs of gold and sterling silver jewelry  --  minced across the carpet on soundless high heels . " These are the people who watch the money ? " Jane wanted to know . " Some of them . " " They remind me ... " " Yes ? " " Of them . The ones on the ship . " " You 're kidding ! " " Kidding ? " she inquired politely . " I mean , you do n't mean it ! " 106  | " Why would I say something I do n't mean ? " Jane turned again to regard the unstill life beyond the window glass . " They remind me of them . So many , so busy , so alike . " Kevin digested the comparison . Watching bank employees through a plate glass window was indeed a rather alien experience , if you thought about it . Who were these people , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know .. . Sobered , he took Jane 's arm and guided her through the big glass doors into the vaulted marble lobby where the guard with the huge black leather holster stood watch near the mid-sized parlour palm in the large ceramic pot . Another guard patrolled the cashiers ' domain , where travertine check-writing stations sprouted like stone mushrooms . Kevin and Jane paused at an unoccupied island while he worried out Kandy 's card . " Stay here . " He reluctantly ordered a change of plan , eyeing the line before the nearest cashier . Jane was too unpredictable ; he could n't risk her saying something outre to the cashier . " I 'm gon na have to get some blank checks . Remember , if there 's any trouble  --  if anybody . . . talks too much to me , or if that guard there comes toward me , just run for it . Hey , it wo n't happen . This 'll be a piece of cake , a shoo-in , a ? " Jane was looking more disoriented by the instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside cold , gave her a look that lasted long enough to mean good-bye , even though he did n't believe it , and affixed himself to the line behind a man smoking a pipe . The fancy travertine floor wept as winter-decked people stood there in their snow-heavy boots . Kevin eyed the black panning boxes that housed the videotape cameras , then ducked his head . The line trudged forward , a baby step at a time . The pipe fumes ahead of him smelled of ripe berries , mixing uneasily in his nostrils with the bus 's vile after-stink . Already the heated air was turning his down jacket into an oven ; something itched on his throat . When he scratched it , his fingernail came away bloody . He remembered too late the shaving nick of the morning . He looked behind him again . Jane still stood where he 'd  | left her , doodling with the chained ballpoint pen on one of the forms . Kevin hoped it was n't anything too incriminating ... . The line lurched a silly little millimeter forward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his watchface . Ten minutes into his hard-bought twenty-five . Yeah , they 'd make it . He peered around the pipe smoker to count how many preceded him . Only four . They 'd make it , just as he 'd promised Jane . He stopped fidgeting and started mentally rehearsing the spiel he 'd give when he got to the head of the line . * Jane looked up . Pillars of brass-trimmed beige marble soared above her . She 'd worked off her gloves to play with the pen and now ran her palm over the cool , stainless steel core bisecting the marble table . It was nice and high , she thought , the table  --  just right to stand at , lean on . But cold . Everything here was cold , although it was inside and seemed well heated  --  shiny and hard and cold . And the people . . . Jane turned full circle for a panoramic view of the lobby . She 'd never seen so many people walking inside a building before , not even on the university campus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shoes . The sounds echoed up and up to the highest pillar top . Jane glanced to where Kevin had been standing . Somebody else stood there now . An odd , disquieting feeling exploded in her , like a pull on an internal , invisible string . She edged sideways and peered harder . She saw a lady in a plaid coat , and the outline of a cocked pipe farther ahead . . . but She released the marble pedestal to which she 'd clung since Kevin had left her . She stepped away , feeling as if the earth had been scooped away from her feet until she had only the cold square foot of marble upon which she now stood . Kevin had kept warning her something might happen . What if nothing had happened ? How was she to act then ? What if he was simply . . . gone ? 108  | Jane turned around , so fast her head felt funny , but then her head was beginning to feel even funnier  --  closed , cluttered and muffled . People 's voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Footsteps neared and washed away . Kevin had vanished , swallowed by the crowded emptiness ... . Jane 's eyes began darting from place to place , clicking images into focus , burning them into her brain in rapid succession . They were all meaningless . Then She saw it . She fixed on one small strand of sanity in the melee . Sound softened , words unwound and made fleeting sense again . " ? and then I go , If that 's the way you feel , ' and he goes ? " . . . " ? selling at forty-nine and seveneighths , not bad considering ? " . . . " ? she 'd be a much better manager if she 'd come to terms with her marriage ; that man ? " Jane smiled and let the noise peel past her . She moved toward what she saw , toward what would save her . Kevin saw the pipe smoker 's broad gray tweed back melt before him . He stepped up to the decorative grate and grinned at the clerk . " Just , uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checks while I 'm waiting for my personalized ones . You know the U.S. mails . " She laughed on cue . " I 'm surprised you were n't given some when you opened the account . " " Well , I was . But I lost ' em . Christmas and all . " Kevin tried to remember what his most charming , truth-telling , social smile felt like . It 'd been so long since he 'd used it , two whole weeks maybe . " If you 've got your account number ? " 109  | " Sure . Urn . . . 67334989-dash-08 . Gosh , these things are long . " The clerk flashed an automatic smile . Her long lacquered nails clicked the sequence into the computer keyboard . She nodded and , eyes still glued to the unseen screen , asked , " Address is 1708 Dupont Avenue South , Mr. Anderson ? " " Right . " At least the Anderson part was right , Kevin consoled himself , ignoring his ignorance of the rest . " And I want some cash now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mascara-gobbed eyelash , but slapped a checkbook holder and a slim batch of blank checks down on the hard cold marble . " I 'll have to run a statement for you . It might take a while to get the computer . " " Oh , sure . . . . " He glanced to the central computer station , where two clerks were already fidgeting . His cashier joined the procession to see the Great God Microchip . Kevin twisted to glance back  --  six people behind him , all staggered to watch the front of the line and therefore arranged into an impossible barrier . He could n't even see the station at which he 'd left Jane , much less Jane . Above him , the high-tech eye in the internal sky panned past him . He spotted a tiny TV set and recognized himself on the third pass . He looked furtive . Minutes had elapsed . Maybe he should vanish right now . The clerk was still waiting for the console , her nails drumming the travertine . She did n't seem to be pressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him in line pushed closer . Kevin eased forward . Nobody liked his personal space infringed upon in public , not even when layers of outerwear made the contact purely a formality . The pressure did n't let up . Kevin shifted position again and turned to do his average citizen cold glare . An unaverage citizen stared back . Kevin read law enforcement in one summing glance . Two nondescript men ? both six feet , both wearing expressions of utter control ? bracketed him , pinned him to the cashier 's cage . " Just come with us , Doctor . No theatrics , " one advised in a practiced undertone. 110  | Kevin shrugged . His cashier suddenly moved away from the computer station . He wondered if she knew what he was wanted for . Of course not . But it had n't stopped her from doing her duty . The account had been watched , as simple as that . The men nudged Kevin out of line and back into the ebb and flow of the lobby . One let a leatherette case flower in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been any middle-aged , short-haired , hard-faced man , some print and an official-looking seal . " Where did you leave your patient , Dr. Blake ? " the man asked politely . " Not here , " Kevin said quickly . So they had n't noticed Jane yet . Elation thrummed through his despair . They were bustling him out of the lobby , out past the station where he was sure he 'd left Jane . The imposing clatter of their triple footsteps made a dark-haired woman in a down jacket look up as they passed . Not Jane , he realized , with a dreadful double dose of relief and frantic worry . Where had he left her , then ? " We 'll check the area anyway , not that we have any reason  --  yet  --  to disbelieve you , Doctor . " " Who are you guys ? " " I showed you identification . " " How many crooks can read that fine print ? We 've got an aging population , you know . " The man actually smiled , tightly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why advertise ? " " That 's for us , to let us know we 're real . " An iron grip on Kevin 's arm stopped the trio . The man looked at his so-far-silent partner , then nodded . " We 're going to sit this one out , Doctor , in the car , while my men finish looking in here . Then we 'll go someplace warm and cozy and you can tell me all about it . " " And if I do n't come peacefully ? " Who was he kidding ? These guys had probably done this a hundred times . But where was Jane ? Why had n't they spotted her already , if they were pros ? 111  | " We 'd rather not cuff you . We 'd rather not make a scene . Maybe you would n't either . " He considered . The more ruckus he raised , the more cop types involved , the more likelihood Jane would be found . She could n't have gone far . . . . He forced himself not to look around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little . " My name is Turner , " he said , " and so far you 're a law-abiding citizen . Keep it that way . " They gave him the low-key , undercover bum 's rush out . Kevin let them , hating his own complicity , but not once , ever , looking back for Jane . Jane stood in line , inching forward with the rest of her line mates , oblivious to everything but the delicate brush of fur against her palm . A whole , gorgeous golden wall of Zyunsinth loomed ahead of her , slung over the shoulders of a tall , gilt-haired woman wearing a leopardskin hat and high-heeled leopardskin boots . Jane thought she was wonderful , and happily inhaled some exotic scent that made her want to sneeze but was so rich in a strangely artificial way . Keeping her light grip on the back of the coat , Jane looked around for Kevin now that she felt anchored again . She was only four lines over from where he had been  --  or was it three ? Her mind backflashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been accurate . He should be right . . . there . But he was n't . Nor was he waiting at the station where he had left her . Zyunsinth pulled out of her grasp and she shuffled forward to keep in contact with it . Jane 's eyes began systematically panning the lobby  --  like one of the watching cameras  --  scanning for height , hair color , clothing , even a flash of blue iris . Nothing . She repeated the procedure , letting her concentration run bone deep . She knew if Kevin was there , and if she really looked for him , she would see him . 112  | Zyunsinth lurched ahead again , then a brassy voice challenged , " Miss ! Do you mind ! " Jane did . Her fingers tightened possessively on the fur . Its hackles raised . Long hairs fanned up like porcupine quills all the way from Jane 's fist to the collar . The woman 's square jaw dropped . " How did you ? ? " Jane released the coat , rejected the coat . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss . This golden fluff was n't Zyunsinth . Zyunsinth was dead and buried . Kevin would have said Zyunsinth had only been a symbol of something else anyway . As the woman flounced ahead , the man behind Jane neatly closed the gap , flashing Jane a look both surprised and smug . The lobby 's din had risen to a discordant buzz again . Jane stepped into its distance , paused , stepped again . People milled around her . No one looked at her . She cocked her head and listened . Nothing . She waited . Nothing at all . At the marble pedestal , three strangers huddled , passing the chained ballpoint pen among themselves . Jane joined them , but they ignored her . She picked up a discarded form , the one that she had scrawled upon . The letters ? some printed backwards , although she knew better now drilled into her brain . 3314AJ U ? 1MA  --  the first word she had written , for Kevin in his office with the comfortable chair and the funny poster of dancing tongues dangling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane turned . She saw the door to the street . Maybe Kevin was there . Or in the van . She began walking briskly to the exit , joining the flow of people , melding with them in their haste and their anonymity . The van , Jane told herself , turning left at the door and striding down the sidewalk . The van . Jane stopped . The van was coughing at the curb , its breath huffing out of its rear tail pipe in tired bursts . Someone  --  not Kevin ? was at the wheel , behind the windshield , turning the van away from the curb into the traffic . Jane gasped as a passerby bumped her . 113  | " Sorry , " the young man mumbled , not sounding it at all . Jane retreated against the building . Behind her the efficient girls in high heels rushed to and fro on a soft velvet-green carpet . Outside , other people had lined up against the building , too . Jane wondered what they had lost . The hole left by the van stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the little red marker clicked against the left side of the curved window and a bright red fan snapped into position . It read " Expired . " A slush-spattered bus , once red but now mostly brown , shouldered to the curb ahead of where the van had been . While Jane watched , several people waiting along the building shuffled forward to mount the bus . She saw them stuff things into a box at the vehicle 's front and heard the mechanism chortle as it swallowed small silver circles . Jane pushed her gloved hands into her empty pockets , but they felt no warmer . She looked up , at pillars of high-rise buildings arrowing toward a slate-gray ceiling of sky . The street echoed , too , with shards of meaningless sound . " Kevin , " Jane tried saying quietly , but that seemed to be just another meaningless sound in a world already overstocked with them . She retreated to utter silence . People came , and waited by the wall , and filed into the buses that arrived , and paused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more seemed to come , and there always seemed to be another bus if they waited long enough . Gradually , it got dark . 114  | " God , do n't you think I 'd tell you if I knew ? " Kevin stared pensively at the limp roll of hundred-dollar bills on Turner 's desk . " She has no money , no place to go , no shelter from the cold  --  I never thought we 'd get separated . " Turner had turned out to be a gentleman , Kevin found , or at least it suited him to masquerade as one . It had been a genteel snatch . Only a half hour after being pinched in the S &L; lobby , Kevin sat in a drab room in some gray government building downtown . He 'd been searched , of course  --  the usual patting down and pocket emptying  --  but no booking , no fingerprinting , no cell . Just talk . So far . The contents of his pockets  --  wallet , Kandy 's van keys , loose change  --  littered Turner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Kevin asked . " Now that I 'm sitting down and can read it ? " Turner produced the small case and slid it across the desktop . Kevin opened it gingerly . " PID . What does that stand for ? " " What did Probe stand for ? " Kevin flashed Turner a reappraising look . " Yeah . I hear that the past tense is appropriate . The Probe unit is gone with the wind . You guys  --  whatever you are  --  can shut things down fast . " Turner waited . " Probe did n't stand for anything , I guess , except what it did . No acronym . It only meant that our small psychiatric  | team dealt with unusual patients in radical ways . Multiple personalities , cult deprogrammings , the criminally insane . It was a license to cut corners and red tape , to fly a little . " " So 's the PID . And that is an acronym . " Turner leaned forward . " Paranormal Intelligence Division . " Kevin whistled . " Of what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You mean the government actually takes that Mind Wars stuff seriously ? " " Do n't you ? " Kevin shrugged , then smiled wryly . " Remote viewing , telepathy , psychic hocus-pocus , no . But I take lots of things more seriously than I used to , including myself . " Turner grew even graver . " You should , Dr. Blake , take things very seriously right now . We want Jane Doe . Washington has decided that her abilities , if genuine , could be vital . Mainstream scientists are very interested in paranormal abilities . Targ and Puthoff had remarkable remote viewing results with ordinary subjects . Imagine what might happen with someone like Jane Doe . And her telekinetic abilities are largely unexplored . " " Do you hear yourself ? You want to set Jane up and make her perform ! The Targ experiments were back in the seventies  --  nothing more has come of them . Why use a human mind as a long-distance voyeur when the skies are crammed with spy satellites and we have cameras that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telekinesis ? nobody believes in Uri Geller and his spoon-bending routine anymore . " " Freud was interested in the paranormal ? " " And was ambivalent . The human mind can play many tricks , I know . What might strike the layman as psi phenomena could be a childish omnipotence fantasy . So-called powers could be an unconscious regression to some vestigial evolutionary mode of communication  --  the appendix of the mind , and as useless . " Turner smiled . " You argue like a conservative , Doctor . So much for dealing with unusual patients in radical ways . ' Besides , what you think does n't matter anymore .  | What does is that Jane Doe is no longer your private property . The cat 's out of the bag . Help us find her and we can overlook the . . . irregularities that occurred in your misguided flight from the authorities . " " How could I flee the authorities when I did n't even know any authorities were after me ? " " Why did you take Jane Doe and run ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Therapy ? In the bridal suite of the Duluth Radisson ? The desk clerk and bellman have identified your pictures . I 've read Dr. Cross 's report on you , heard the tape of your last session with her ? " Kevin fought to maintain his distance , but Turner 's words had raked a razor across his Achilles ' heel  --  his sexual relationship with Jane . " Tell me about the bridal suite therapy , Dr. Blake , " Turner prodded ruthlessly . If labeled an ass , might as well act the part , Kevin concluded . " I told you I was a radical shrink . I wanted to take her around the state , see if any place rang a bell with her . " " Did the woods in Duluth ring a bell ? Was that therapy , ' too ? " Turner 's affability faded as anger leaked into his eyes . " I lost two men there , under brutal  --  and mysterious ? circumstances . " " What about Professor Neumeier 's cabin ? " Kevin challenged back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old woman ? Dead of a heart attack , come on ! She survived Auschwitz but not you guys . " Another kind of pain briefly seized Turner 's eyes . " She was . . . terribly old . It should n't have happened . A routine interrogation . We never touched her . She was more fragile than she looked . " " Oh , great . And that 's why you want Jane , to interrogate her ! You really expect me to smile and stand aside while you people probe my patient 's delicate brain with an elephant gun ? " " We 're not inhuman , Blake , just doing our jobs , as you were doing yours . I 'm no judge and jury . I do n't care about  | your libido or hers . Jane Doe apparently has extraordinary abilities . They could be useful to science , to the future , to our government , yes . You have no right to play dog in the manger . Cooperate , and you can help her , assure yourself that no damage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your government shrinks narcoanalyze Jane with battery acid . If you bully boys realized what fiendish drugs have come out of the biological warfare and Cold War spy labs , you would n't inject them into the cockroach who ate your sister , believe me . " " That 's not my job . It 's my job to find Jane Doe  --  and you  --  and get her into the proper hands . " Kevin snorted at the final phrase , and Turner 's face darkened . " Who gave you a God license , Blake ? You do n't own Jane Doe just because she happened to fall into your lap . Nobody does . Thanks principally to your own efforts , the kooks from Crookston were debunked . Even if you got the Volkers to raise h ? . . . a hue and cry about the government taking Jane , they have no legal power over her . Neither do you . " " Is everything a matter of legality to you ? " Turner grunted . " Morality . I knew you 'd come to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do my job . If I can persuade you to cooperate , you 'll come out of this with only your pride bruised . Otherwise ? " " Now the threats tiptoe out . " " Take this one seriously , Dr. Blake . " Turner 's tired eyes pinned Kevin to his own weariness ; even now his backbone was turning to rubber . " It 's not up to me what happens to you . If we 're unable to persuade you to tell us where Jane Doe is ? " " I do n't know . Goddammit , I honestly lost her ! " Like most people , Kevin lied best when he was telling the truth . Turner smiled . " Maybe you did lose her . We do n't honestly care . We just want to find her . If you help , things will go well for you . You 'll walk out of here with the keys to your condo and your car , with your life in pretty much one piece . You 'll need a job , but you 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That bastard was willing to hang me out to dry ! Poor old Norbert , I used to respect him once . " " Apparently it was reciprocal . Yeah , I hear you could have had an important career . Why not save that ? You 're on treacherous ground ethically anyway . I 'm no therapist , but maybe you need to get away from Jane Doe , let her get free . Sure , you 'll feel a little tragic , but you 've lost girlfriends before , I 'm sure ? " " Fuck off ! Find some other house shrink . " His degree of anger reflected his degree of temptation . Kevin was so tired , and the offer seemed so damn reasonable . If Turner had n't reminded him of losing Julie .. . " We already have . " Turner rose and shrugged . " I 'll be sorry to turn you over to him . " He paused at the closed door , then looked back . " You know , Dr. Blake , you may be right . Jane Doe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply prove her unessential . She could be released again very shortly . " " You work for the PID . What do you think ? Do you believe in this psi stuff ? " " Frankly ? No . No more than I believe in the Volkers ' close encounter story . " " Yet you 'd hand Jane over  --  whatever she is , she 's a traumatized human being , an amnesiac who 's been chased from pillar to post  --  knowing your cold warriors would poke around inside her head with a meat hook looking for something that 's very likely not there ? " " It 's my job , " Turner said . " I lost two men chasing her  --  and you . I 'd rather we found something that made all that worthwhile . " " You 're something else , " Kevin accused , letting anger and contempt  --  and impotence  --  ooze into his voice and eyes . " Maybe . But just sit tight here and hang on hard . You have n't met our shrink yet . " * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An oblong of green paper had been wind-wrapped around its metal base . She unpeeled it . 121  | It looked almost like money , except that the paper was too flimsy and the writing was all wrong . But she 'd seen people exchange this slip for a bus ride . She glanced around the darkened streets . The sodium iodide lamps , flickering on , had pocked the snow with pools the color of Mercurochrome . Fewer and fewer people waited for buses now , and the buses came less and less often . The girls behind the glass window had gone long before , slipcasing their typewriters and dimming the green glows of their computer screens . Parking spaces along the street stayed empty when they were vacated now . Kevin , Jane knew  --  as surely as she knew things like how far away the sun is and the speed of light  --  was n't coming back . When the next gear-grinding red behemoth lumbered to the curb and snapped open its double doors , Jane followed an old woman with a shopping bag into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glancing to her face . Jane perched on the long bench seat near the stairs and twisted to watch the Upper Midwest Savings &; Loan , a neon-red emblem looming above its entryway now , slip behind her . She tried to observe the passing streets , but someone stared back at her from the dark , and the little old lady across from her on the bus peered over her shoulder . It took a moment for Jane to realize that she was sandwiched by reflections  --  her own and the lady 's . Jane pressed her face to the window , putting gloved hands to her eyes as blinders , and began reading street signs as the bus jolted past them without stopping . Fourth Street . Then Fifth , Sixth . The bus stopped at Seventh and three people got on . Eighth and Ninth ground by , a patchwork of sparsely lit buildings sprinkled with pedestrians . At least the bus was going in the right direction , Jane thought . She would get off  --  her mind zoomed into focus on the street map of Minneapolis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines and tiny type tightened into perfect focus . She 'd get off at Franklin Avenue and walk the rest of the way . Kevin had been angry with her once before when she 'd walked alone at night to his place  --  angry and then , unaccountably , pleased . Jane remembered how he 'd held her , Zyunsinth spread over them both , how they 'd slept together on his sofa as warm and kitten-content as that soft , silly creature of his . There had been no sex between them that night , but Jane did n't mind . For one thing , she really had n't known how to do it yet . For another , some things were even better than sex . Sometimes . She smiled and cradled her face on her hands , swaying to the bus 's melancholy motion . Kevin had tried to take her home not long ago ; maybe he had gone there now , too . Turner 's office boasted only one oversized window , and night had finally faded it to black , like a TV tube that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluorescent lights , staring out the window and knowing that there was nothing to see beyond it , nothing but his own reflection , murky and evasive . He knew , too , that the wait was meant to unnerve him . It did . At last he got up and paced the chilly room . They 'd hung his jacket in the outer office , as if he were just a regular visitor and could leave whenever he liked . But he figured that he had become an official enemy of the state  --  an obstruction , really , not important enough to rank as an enemy . A bureaucratic impediment . He gave an infinitesimal tweak to the brushed chrome 123  | doorknob . It seemed to have contracted lockjaw . Okay , Turner , he told himself with comic-book bravado . Maybe I 've got lockjaw , too . Unluckily , his mind had n't locked . It revved , that numb , overtaxed brain of his . It conjured gruesome scenarios of Jane lost , frozen , raped , run over . The worst one remained the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Where would she go ? Kevin could n't say , but they would n't believe that . The door cracked open walnut-neat . Turner hovered behind some incoming figure . " I 'll alert the stakeout at the condo ; maybe she 'll head there , " Turner was telling someone else behind him . No ! Kevin 's mind revolted at the fiendishly apt logic of that idea . It had n't occurred to him . No , Jane , no ! Do n't go there . Stay . . . lost . The stranger on the threshold resolved into a smallish man with an army of manila folders marshaled under his elbow . He turned to shut the door behind him , shutting Turner up  --  and out . A fur-lined leather coat that would have looked good on George Hamilton draped his shoulders . An expensive ostrich skin briefcase dangled from his free hand . He took Turner 's place at the desk , opening the case and eyeing its contents hungrily . One by one he laid out the folders , like cards in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He paused now and again to regard Kevin over the sinister circles of his thick , rimless glasses . None of it scared Kevin , none of it  --  stranger , silent treatment , stupid props  --  until the man lifted a hinged black plastic case from the bowels of the briefcase . It opened with a click . Kevin could guess what lay inside . The case 's raised cover shielded its contents from Kevin , but the man seemed to gloat over them , his hands moving to caress certain objects within . " When does Sydney Greenstreet get here ? " Kevin asked abruptly . " You always had a smart mouth . " The man did n't look up . Move and countermove . Kevin contemplated the bald-124  | ing spot crowning the man 's bowed head . Now he was supposed to get unglued trying to place the bastard . He chose silence . Any reply would have weakened his position . Folder after folder was shifted , straightened , flipped tantalizingly open and then snapped shut again . The oblong black case remained open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to house false hope for Kevin . The man finally looked up , directly at Kevin . The overhead bank of fluorescents poured light the color of bile down on them both . One lamp , failing , sizzled with faint blue lightning . Kevin wondered if that was deliberate , then dismissed the idea as paranoia . They could pull a lot more effective tricks if they wanted to . " So , Dr. Blake , " the man began . Kevin still could n't place the voice , the face . " How long , " he went on pleasantly , " have you been screwing your patients ? " A blood-red bull of rage charged through Kevin , herding all the adrenaline in his body before it . He dammed the reaction before it became just what the doctor across him had ordered . Now Kevin recognized the man  --  the manner of attack . " At least I do n't screw up their heads , Dr. Nordstrom . " Nordstrom smiled . " I 'm flattered . " " No , just unforgettable , like a posthypnotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised you used it on Jane Doe . I thought you considered yourself more adventuresome . That 's a . . . milquetoast method  --  out-of-date and overrated . " Kevin quashed the impulse to answer that he 'd done pretty well with it ; that 's exactly what Nordstrom wanted to know . " Look , Aaron , let 's cut out the cat and mouse ? " " Eric , " Nordstrom seethed , his face whitening against the shiny black square of night behind it . " It 's been a while , " Kevin agreed . " I did n't know you got your kicks from government cases nowadays . " " I have a private practice as well , in Manhattan . Quite lucrative . " He opened a manila folder . " I was surprised , too , to find you . . . subsisting ... on a university salary . You would have done better in private practice . " " Money 's not everything , as you ought a know , " Kevin 125  | shot back , wincing anyway at the sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Letting an antagonist see your salary was almost worse than letting him observe your sex life . " Of course you had your headlines , " Nordstrom mused , cracking another folder , one obviously older than the others . Kevin glimpsed tatters of yellowed newsprint , even recognized the still-white , slick page with the old item from Time . . . . How had the PID managed to unearth this creep ? he wondered . Probably the same way Probe had found Kevin . Nordstrom decisively shut the folder . " I have no headlines , but I 've had interesting work , too , all these years . My consultation cases . As you know , the government and the universities do n't pay that well . But they offer other advantages . I too have ridden the cutting edge of current psychiatric practice , ' Blake . Smarts , sometimes , does n't it ? " Kevin recognized the line from the Time article , and shrugged . Offhand gestures had always nettled Nordstrom 's sense of formality . Nordstrom opened a new folder , its front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane Doe is an intriguing case . " " I thought so , too . . . at first . " " You apparently thought other things later . I 'm eager to meet her , the woman who pulled you off your pedestal . " " She 's just an . . . interesting case ? " " Your eyelids widen slightly when you lie , the way William F. Buckley 's do when he 's going for the jugular , did you know that , Blake ? It 's almost as if you have to force yourself to watch yourself do it . You 'll never last in this game without lying . " " I 'll practice , " Kevin promised sharply . Nordstrom nodded , his manicured hand cupping his mouth but not quite concealing a slightly crooked smile . Kevin 's memories of the man came trickling back . Nordstrom had been too unlikable to dwell on , but he 'd been bright enough , in his self-effacing way , and rich enough . And sly enough . 126  | " I 've been thinking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew up , Kevin saw the glint of a watch far richer than his own . His watch lay on the desk , with the other possessions Turner had taken from his pockets . Kevin 's body remained free , but his person had been stripped of his things , his accessories . As if a mind reader , Nordstrom picked up the timepiece , letting the fine jointed gold band lie snake-supple across his small , manicured hand . " I 've spoken to your parents . . . . " " My parents ? " Kevin kept his voice cold , polite , like Nordstrom 's . " Nice people . " The watch still draped his palm , on the verge of slipping to the desktop . Kevin did n't care , he told himself , but he projected his parents into the watch they had given him anyway . " Nice people , " Nordstrom repeated . " Ordinary people . Proud of you . And puzzled , of course . " " What did you talk to them about ? " " You . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You . " " They do n't know who you are ? " " I told them . I 'm assigned to a special government unit , I said . Oh , like our son , ' they said . " Nordstrom smiled . " Your mother got on the extension . She was so excited to hear about you . Does n't get too many long-distance calls . Been a bit busy lately , Doctor ? Forget your familial du-ties ? " " It is n't a duty , but then you would n't understand that . " " Do n't worry , I did n't tell them what hot water you 're in . I simply sowed a few seeds . Said there was a case I needed to question you about . One of your female patients . That you were missing , you were . . . both missing and we . . . were concerned . I said that some people thought you had run away with your patient , so to speak . They are old-fashioned folk , are n't they , your parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't it ? " " You contemptible bastard , " Kevin said without feeling . 127  | Feeling would n't help him now . " Yeah , they 're real easy . It must have given you a kick to manipulate people like that . They live in a town so small they think everyone who rings the doorbell or the phone needs something , and deserves it . " They gave me what I needed . " Nordstrom put the watch down , nudging it so it lay straight . " Oh , their Kevin would n't do anything wrong like that , no . Elope with a patient , never . Violate his professional ethics , heavens no . It was rather touching . Too bad they were wrong . " " Parents often are wrong about their children , particularly the grown ones . Were n't yours about you ? " Nordstrom 's lips screwed a millimeter tighter . " Your parents defended you to the ditches , you 'll be gratified to hear . Told me all about you and your early days  --  your grades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit  --  such a paragon , such an all-American boy . They finished up with your scholarship to Harvard . " " That should have got you up-to-date . " " Odd , though , that 's when I discovered I knew more about you , from that point on . They did n't even know about Julie Symons . " Kevin shrugged the shrug that had infuriated Turner . He hoped it would do the same for Nordstrom . " Maybe Julie Symons was n't that important . " It did . " She was ! " Nordstrom 's fist hit the desk , folders twitching at the blow . " You . . . lying ? " His face smoothed . " She was , " he repeated more coldly . " I did n't think you even knew her . " " You did n't think a lot of things you should have then . " Kevin shrugged again . " So you got my parents all worried about me  --  about where I might be , about what I might have done . I do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long , long time . They 'll get over it . " " Still , it 's bound to be distressing . They 'll call the Probe unit first  --  and find it . . . gone . They 'll call your apartment . . . and get no answer . They 'll start to look for your friends , and realize that they do n't know who they are . Or maybe that you do n't have that many ? " " I 'm particular . " 128  | " You do n't need anyone ! " Nordstrom charged . " How long since you 've seen your parents  --  those nice , grayhaired old people in Elk River ? " " Six months , so sue me . " " They 're very worried about you , Kevin . " Nordstrom 's eyes grew soulful as he assumed the role of guilt-applying authority . Kevin could see that the man would have a certain force with his patients if they were unsophisticated or damaged enough . " Yeah , well , I 'm pretty worried about me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentarily disarmed Nordstrom . " You should be . I 'm nobody to trifle with . " " Trifle with . ' Come on , Nordstrom , no wonder nobody takes you seriously . You want to talk no friends , take a look at your own social calendar . How could I remember you off the bat ? You were n't very memorable , except as something unpleasant people have to take sometimes , like castor oil . Pursuing degrees instead of humanity . You want to talk maladjusted , let me put my cards on the table  --  I 'm a pretty good analyst , you know . " " Shut up ! " The man 's voice sank to a whisper . " Shut up . I had connections , who needs friends ? And Julie was my friend  --  did n't know that , did you , Dr. Hotshot ? Julie Symons was n't yours alone ; she was mine , too . " " That 's sick , Nordstrom . " Kevin 's contempt was deeply genuine now , so real he could n't look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause to reassess his opponent , to figure out what Nordstrom really wanted , what Nordstrom really was . He did n't like the possibilities that were clarifying in his mind . " She was mine ! " Nordstrom 's intensity of tone implied spittle . Kevin was glad he was sitting six feet away . He looked back at the man , because he had to . Nordstrom 's fist whitened in the chilly room ; it clenched , crushed something shiny and black and white . Kevin felt his face melt like a Salvador Dali clock as he realized what it was . He was up and leaning over the desk , manila folders scattering , the briefcase lid banging down , Nordstrom 's Ivy 129  | League tie knot in his hand , his other hand crushing wool suiting material . " How the fucking hell did you get a hold of that , you twisted son of a bitch ? ? " Kevin did n't recognize his own voice . It sounded raw , as if he 'd been shouting himself hoarse at a basketball game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color and sound . His hands knew they could tear Nordstrom apart . He wanted to let them . Nordstrom 's glasses had jolted crooked on his bland , ugly face . Kevin could have squeezed , shaken , throttled , except that Nordstrom 's eyes flicked significantly away , down and to the left . He repeated the gesture , quick and slick as a snake 's tongue sniffing the air for scent . Kevin followed the glance . At last , now , leaning over Nordstrom across the desk , Kevin could see into the black case . He saw what he had been afraid he 'd see  --  a glistening row of syringes cradled in notched velveteen , fine white lines scribing their sides to the fifty-milligram mark . Chemical abbreviations for the clear liquid contents were scrawled on the adhesive tape wound around them . Kevin recognized sodium pentothal and amytal sodium , a hypnotic drug , but three more syringes lay there , unidentified foreign substances filling their familiar shining tubes . " At my discretion , Blake , " Nordstrom enunciated . " My discretion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state now . But if you do n't control yourself , I 'll go to these sooner rather than later . " That clinical array iced Kevin 's rage . He eased back into his chair , brooding on the drugs . Such things were useful in the practice of psychiatry , had helped many patients and irretrievably harmed a few . He did n't like them , but someone like Nordstrom would say that was because he liked to hog all the glory with his technique in session . Kevin would say that the human mind , given half a chance , could produce more wonders than a battalion of injected chemical wonder-workers . " Nice work if you can get it . " Kevin stretched out his legs and laced his fingers over his stomach . The posture 130  | would irritate Nordstrom for its studied insouciance , but it was also physically unthreatening . Nordstrom , Kevin realized now , was far too dangerous to threaten . The man was smoothing the wrinkles in the stolen photograph . Kevin had kept the picture under glass for ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fingers crush and then caress the slick paper image made his guts clench until they hurt , but he knew Nordstrom wanted it to hurt . In any psychiatrist-patient encounter , the one who hurts less will emerge the stronger . A prick of fear , like a needle delicately encroaching on Kevin 's skin , burned into the base of his neck . " You had no right to take it . " Kevin nodded at the photo . " It has nothing to do with anything now . " " It has everything to do with it ! " Nordstrom glanced up , his glasses still low on his nose so the unfocused fever of his eyes  --  mud-brown  --  drove into Kevin 's . " It 's the key to you , Doctor  --  to your delusion about this amnesia patient , to your obsession with her .... " " My obsession ! " Kevin laughed . " At least my obsession lives . " It was a cheap shot , cheaply intended . Nordstrom 's pupils contracted to pinpricks and Kevin felt a throb of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special , " Kevin began again , not sure exactly where to lead Nordstrom , yet aware that now  --  for the moment  --  he could do it . " Julie was one of a kind . I can see that . . . anyone would hate to lose her . " Kevin hated exhuming Julie and exposing her  --  and himself  --  to this particular postmortem . " Beautiful , " Nordstrom crooned to the photo . " Beautiful . " Kevin nodded . Julie had once been beautiful to him , too , and sometimes silence makes the best crowbar . Nordstrom continued to stroke the ragged white lines his fist had etched into the photograph . Kevin abstracted himself from the sight . Julie . . . maybe Dr. Cross had been right to call her death the turning point in Kevin 's life , his career . But Kevin knew that Julie was dead . He knew the difference between memory and reality . Nordstrom did n't seem to  --  or care . 131  | " You better get used to me having this , holding this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't understand yet , do you , Blake ? I 'm the government 's most useful headhunter . I have total discretion to pry into any corner of your life that intrigues me , to probe every nook and cranny of your mind . I can make any disposition of your body that I deem necessary , including pumping you so full of my magic potions you would babble your soul to me for a season pass to the Buffalo Bills . " " Truth serums are a lie , " Kevin said calmly . " You know that . They rely on environmental factors as much as any inherent power . They hang on the gullibility of the subject , the skill of the questioner . Sure , they knock inhibitions for a loop , but I know that it 's believing that truth serums work that makes victims vulnerable . It 's hard to hoodwink an educated consumer , Nordstrom . " " Still , you 'd find it . . . unpleasant to be out of control , to know that I was rummaging around in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Still beautiful , is n't she ? " Wrinkles radiated through the paper , making it look as if glass had shattered across the photographic face . Kevin no longer considered Julie 's emaciated ballerina 's look beautiful , but a badge of pain and deprivation , of the distorted push for perfection that had driven Julie to the slow , dying fall of anorexia nervosa . " Yes , " he told Nordstrom , keeping his eyes steady , " she was beautiful . " Then it hit him , the really wacko thing about Nordstrom 's fixation on Julie  --  not that it existed , but that it existed still . " Eric , what was Julie to you ? What is she to you ? " " She is . . . " Nordstrom 's eyes radiated not lust , not even love beyond living with , but ingrown obsession . " ? mine now , as she was never yours . You threw her away , all of you . I kept her . I was even the last to see her . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , except her parents and brother . And me . " " I did n't see her there . It . . . irritated me , Julie sick and lying there , and me not allowed to see her ; Julie literally 132  | shrinking and me not seeing it . The last I 'd seen of Julie had been that fall  --  on campus  --  running across it , her pink dancing tights showing between her boots and her skirt hem . Julie swathed in scarves and jackets and thick wool skirts so I could n't see her . And all the time , shrinking , dwindling , melting ? " " A lot of us did n't see it at first , " Kevin interjected roughly . " Is that it ? So you blame yourself , Eric , for not noticing Julie 's illness , for not being able to help her ? That 's very understandable ? " " Oh , if I had noticed . . . I would have been her dresser . " Nordstrom 's eyes grew dreamy . " I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on stage , pale tights clinging to every bone and hollow , the satin bodice so flat and stiff , her arms ladders of light  --  baby pink spotlights above  --  and the deep shadows , her face more dark with night than bright . Her eyes , lost . I would have waited in the wings , counting the vertebrae on her back as they etched sharper and sharper into the shadow . I would have waited in the shadows for her to sink into shadow , until her skin had worn as thin as her toe shoes , thinner than a withered leaf in the fall , that fall , and I would touch it and find my fingertips on the bone .... " " Did you love Julie , Eric , or did you  --  do you  --  love death ? " " Julie is death , Kevin . " Tears glazed Nordstrom 's eyes . Kevin sat silent . He had learned more than he had wanted to . Despite his horror of Nordstrom , the professional fever pulsed in him  --  what a classic case the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alienation and envy that had formed the current sociopathic personality . What a . . . triumph to help , heal , so diseased a mind . It would take a sensibility that was healthy to the extent that Nordstrom was ill . Kevin relinquished the fantasy for what it was . " When did you see Julie last ? " Kevin asked quietly , not because he could use the answer , but because , having descended into a loved one 's grave with a ghoul , he needed to exhume his own guilt . " At the funeral home . Julie was at home to guests . . . 133  | dancing Sleeping Beauty . I wakened her with a kiss . She 's been with me ever since . I 've been wanting to tell you ever since . " " Is it making you happy ? " " Yes ! Happier than standing ignored on campus , watching you and Julie play your own private version of Love Story . So sad , so tragic , " Nordstrom mocked . " Poor Kevin , going on without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nordstrom waited for Kevin 's denial or anger . There was neither . He jabbed harder . " You were unfaithful to her . Look at you , forgetting Julie for this ? " He jerked open another folder and tossed the sketch of Jane down beside Julie 's photograph . Kevin tensed . It was one thing to psych yourself into letting an enemy manhandle your past ; quite another to see him mess with your present . " I 've treated a lot of patients since Julie ; I 've had a lot of women since Julie . " Kevin was deliberately crude to depersonalize the subject . Nordstrom leaned intently forward , his fingers gathering both images toward himself . " True enough . But have you ever really loved again , since Julie . And " ? Nordstrom 's icy eyes warmed ? " and lost ? Again . " " Excuse me , miss , do you have the time ? " Jane stared at the woman in horn-rimmed glasses who 'd laid a mittened hand on her arm . The woman clutched several packages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one has time , " Jane answered scrupulously . " Time is a myth of sorts . An appearance . Time is our own motions named and numbered . It really is a metaphysical problem . I read once ? " 134  | " No , no . I meant , a watch . " The woman spoke even more slowly than Jane , enunciating every word . " Are you wearing a watch ? Can you tell me what time it is ? " " Oh . " Jane lifted her wrist , as Kevin used to do , and paused . " No , I 'm not wearing a watch . " She thought a moment . " But it 's . . . six thirty-eight ? " " Thank you . " The woman turned , but Jane 's hand reached out to delay her . " Eighteen thirty-eight oh-one-dot-eighty , exactly , " Jane finished . " Fine ! Jeez , sorry I asked . You could have just said no ! " The woman huffed away , rattling her packages . " I 'm not sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hugged new self-knowledge to herself . No one had ever told Jane she knew the time automatically , internally . She would have liked to ask Kevin about it , but of course , she could n't . That disappointed her . It made the cold seem more efficient at slipping up her jacket sleeves and down its collar . It made the distance she had to go seem a little longer . Jane had never felt tired before . She remained standing by the bus stop sign along with the other waiting people . She had just gotten off the last bus and had no intention of taking the next , but Jane liked the presence of this clot of people near the snowy street corner . There was something cozy about their silent congregation , something almost conspiratorial . The dark evening and the hushed , falling snow felt like their voices . And their comings and goings intrigued her . A bus snorted up to the curb . Its huge headlights spotlighted dancing snow flurries . Jane stepped politely back while people surged past her into the bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess who would embark and who would wait for the next bus . Three stayed she had thought would go , and two went she had thought would stay . Her estimates were getting closer . She sighed and looked up at the streetlamps . Snowflakes flirted around the globes of light , thick as , as . . . falling dandruff . Pleased with her comparison , Jane turned and trudged alone down Franklin Avenue . Kevin 's place was twelve blocks away , her inboard map 135  | told her . The distance was nothing like the three miles she had walked once before to get there . She kept her gloved hands in her empty pockets , lowered her face to the tickle of the wind-blown snowflakes , and kept walking . Franklin Avenue was faced with two- and three-story buildings on either side . Some were decaying apartment buildings , most were storefronts housing wholesalers , oldclothes dealers and basement gemologists . By the time Jane turned from Franklin 's glare to the dark , curved residential streets south of Loring Park , her internal clock chimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never felt this kind of urgent hunger before , either , and wondered if she had to , or simply expected to . She lifted her face to the night and let snowflakes melt on her tongue . At least she would n't be thirsty , she thought . Kevin 's building finally hulked before her ; she recognized it immediately . His apartment was on the third floor , reached by the wooden stairs lacing the building 's rear . Jane loitered among the trees bordering the parking area . Her eyes accurately picked Kevin 's from the patchwork of doors dotting the three stories , then raked across the windows that should be his . One oozed a subtle incandescent glow through closed vertical blinds . Thin stripes of soft light cast a pattern like golden bars onto the night-darkened glass . A strange feeling clasped Jane in its alien arms : it was composed equally of excitement and peace . She searched herself for the proper word and found it  --  not in the clearinghouse of her retentive memory dictionary , but in something she had absorbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aching familiarity , Jane thought , might resemble . . . coming home . She started across the parking lot , her mind already resurrecting the rooms she had seen only once  --  three white-painted walls , one of age-dusted brick , bookcases , a stereo setup , the little kitchen , the big sofa . . . . Two men stepped from a parked van and stamped their feet . Near them , Jane sensed the eternal scan of electrical impulses , the watchdog machines that made her hackles rise . 136  | Jane paused , caught in a pink-gold sodium iodide circle . She did n't move . She did n't move at all , not even to let air lift her lungs and then let them collapse . Instead , she listened . Her blood surged thickly in her ears . She slowed it to a meander through her veins . " Crazy to check it out again ! " one man grumbled . " Colder out than the balls on a brass monkey , and we 've been cooling our heels all shift . We 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead-end stakeouts ? " " Ass-numbing is right , " the other answered , laughing . " Shut up and climb . We got all night . Might as well look busy . " The men lumbered up the semilit stairs , dark forms as faceless as the men in the north woods , as any of the men Kevin had warned her against . When they passed beyond even her acute earshot , she let her breath ease warmly into the snow swirling before her face . She skittered across the lot to shelter under the shadowed stairs at mid-building . Not long after , the clump of descending feet sifted snow like flour through the cracks in the stairs . Words sifted down , too . " ? wild goose chase , I told yah . Nobody 's comin ' back to that hole . " " Hey , not a bad place ! " " Do n't like all that modern crap , though . Too empty . " " Got a coffin nail ? " A small flame spit into life between the two men as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , then uncurled her fingers . The men walked on , talking . Jane no longer listened . Later , much later , when falling snow had veiled the rear window of the men 's van , Jane slipped up the steps , treading carefully in their footprints . Kevin had n't liked leaving traces . He had left the imprint of his snow angel in the north woods , Jane thought incongruously . She remembered her spell of amnesia in the woods , remembered beginning to feel real again and not lost in some remote part of her own body . Then Kevin had appeared before her refocusing eyes  --  a dark blot on the snow , but moving as he lay there supine , 137
