Trouble amid the bear hugs <P> As he stepped off the Aeroflot jetliner onto the tarmac of Moscow 's Vnukovo Airport , Afghanistan 's President Babrak Karmal was given effusive greetings by a phalanx of Soviet officials led by Communist Party Chief Leonid Brezhnev . The Afghan leader was on his first venture outside the Soviet-occupied country since he was installed as Moscow 's puppet last December . The sheer number of senior Soviet Politburo members participating in the Moscow welcome demonstrated the Kremlin 's obvious desire to shore up Karmal 's legitimacy and make a show of his supposed influence with the Kremlin . Mused a Western diplomat who observed the arrival : " There were more bear hugs than at a circus . " <P> No amount of bear hugging , however , could hide frustrations over the inability of the Soviets ' 85,000 occupation troops to vanquish the rebel insurgents ' continued resistance in Afghanistan . In a propagandistic way , Karmal admitted as much when he complained to his Soviet hosts that bandits and terrorists armed by the U.S. and China " intimidate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state organizations . " <P> Just 60 miles from Kabul , in fact , in the Ghorband Valley leading to the city of Bamiyan ( pop . 47,000 ) , seesaw battles between Soviet troops and bands of insurgents are said to have caused heavy casualties on both sides . In the Panjshir Valley northeast of Kabul , the Soviets have apparently given up their attempt to dislodge the fierce mujahidin ( Islamic warriors ) from their strongholds . Similarly , Soviet troops have been unsuccessful in efforts to reimpose order on the lawless city of Herat in the northwest , and have only managed to maintain a tenuous and frequently interrupted hold on Kandahar in the south . In Kabul , sniper and grenade attacks have forced a progressively longer and stricter curfew , most recently from 10 o'clock in the evening to 5 in the morning . <P> Simple mismanagement has made a shambles of the economy . Afghanistan 's gross national product has dropped 70% to 80% in the past year . As industrial activity has slowed , revenues from government enterprises such as electric-power plants and textile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being collected , but mostly by the mujahidin , who control many of the roads . A result : severe cuts in public spending , especially in education and welfare . <P> Persistent food shortages have aroused fears of a possible famine this winter . Nearly 1.5 million head of sheep and goats have been herded into neighboring Pakistan by Afghan refugees , for example . Farmers not working their fields to their fullest potential run the risk of having their lands confiscated by the government . But such draconian rules can hardly be enforced in areas controlled by the mujahidin . <P> For all its gladhanding , Karmal 's sojourn in Moscow was expected to turn up little in the way of hard Soviet aid , at least not enough to pump some life into Afghanistan 's hemorrhaging economy . Instead , Karmal and Brezhnev signed a wide-ranging treaty of military cooperation . Said Karmal , with utter slavishness : " Were it not for the Soviet Union , there would be no Afghanistan on the political map of our planet , and all mankind would have been suppressed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
