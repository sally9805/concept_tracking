Hussein urges Arafat to ease his stand on the Palestinian issue <P> It was a meeting of historic dimensions , not so much for what it accomplished as for what it set in motion . On one side was Jordan 's King Hussein , head of the ancient Hashemite dynasty and ruler of a country whose population is about 65% Palestinian . On the other was Yasser Arafat , leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization , who had just been driven out of Lebanon along with thousands of his guerrillas after a ten-week Israeli siege of their West Beirut stronghold . Bitterness and mutual suspicion had often divided the two men since Hussein 's violent expulsion of P.L.O . guerrillas from Jordan in 1970 . But a dramatic new set of circumstances brought them together in Amman last week for four days of private talks and lavish banquets that Arafat described as a " significant and destiny-shaping " event . <P> The main subject of their discussions was President Ronald Reagan 's plan to establish Palestinian self-government in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right to exist . Arafat said that the plan had " some positive elements , " although he criticized its rejection of full Palestinian statehood . Still , there was some reason for encouragement in Arafat 's seeming openness to consider the idea . " Reading between the lines , " said an Administration official , " I think there is a realization on Arafat 's part that the Reagan initiative is the only practical way to go for the foreseeable future . " Describing the P.L.O . leader 's apparent shift from military bravado to pragmatic diplomacy , a Middle East expert in Amman remarked , " It is time to fish or cut bait . The hour has arrived when Arafat must become a political leader and not just a guerrilla leader . " <P> According to sources close to the talks , that is precisely what Hussein told Arafat last week . The King reportedly repeated his support of a Palestinian-Jordanian federation , an idea that the P.L.O . has rejected in the past . Hussein warned Arafat that the Palestinians might be forced to accept something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Arafat was told by Hussein and West Bank leaders that he had little time to lose : the Israeli settlement program in the West Bank was in effect annexing the area . <P> Hussein also sought some compromises from the P.L.O . on the question of recognizing Israel 's existence , and asked for a clear-cut mandate to speak for the P.L.O . in future negotiations with the U.S. Arafat and a dozen other top P.L.O . leaders assembled in Amman were reluctant to make any firm commitments on the major issues . The P.L.O . ' s executive committee must endorse any major changes in policy . Moreover Arafat may seek a mandate from the Palestine National Council , the Palestinian parliament-in-exile . But Arafat authorized Hussein to communicate to Washington the P.L.O . ' s interest in at least pursuing the Reagan initiative . That put the burden on Washsington to persuade Israel to be less obdurate about holding on to the West Bank .
