I have always found scenery , by itself , to be quite tiresome . NEVILLE Well , then , you will be relieved to find we have contrived to keep all the scenery outdoors . Wo n't you sit down . ( Taking the forms from his jacket . ) I 've completed all the forms you sent us , and I think you 'll see my brother has included a contribution to the school 's building fund . You did n't request it , of course , but as I told my brother , I 'm sure you 're in the planning stages of something or other . ( Then to MRS . MEDLOCK . ) Mrs. Medlock , will you see what 's keeping Mary ? ( MARY enters , followed by FAKIR and AYAH . ) MARY LENNOX I 'm right here , sir . NEVILLE Quite right . Here 's our girl .

WINTHROP Certainly . And let me say from the start that you are not on trial here . The Board of Trustees has accepted your application . NEVILLE Oh That 's good news , indeed . MARY LENNOX I wo n't go . You ca n't make me ! ( MARY throws a cookie on the floor . ) NEVILLE Mary Lennox ! MRS . WINTHROP That 's all right , doctor .

WINTHROP Of course , doctor . perhaps she would enjoy seeing some photographs of the girls at their work . I 've brought several samples of the fine lace for which our girls are so p. 86 MARY LENNOX I hate you ! You 're a horrible , ugly pig NEVILLE That 's quite enough , young lady ! MARY LENNOX Your school is a filthy rathole full of brats and dirty beds . And all anybody really does there is scrub floors ! ( She takes a breath . ) I hope you get hit by a lorry on the way home and your ugly head rolls off in a ditch and gets eaten by maggots ! ( Another breath . ) I hate you ! I hate you ! I hate you !

NEVILLE Oh for God 's sake . He does n't care about you . All he wants is never to see you again . Why do you think he left without even saying goodbye to you ? MARY LENNOX Maybe he was in a hurry . NEVILLE You drove him away . You remind him of his wife . MARY LENNOX I look like my Aunt Lily ? NEVILLE Now it is my task to find you a suitable place to go so that my brother can return . The next school I will contact will send no representative . Your bags will be packed and you will leave Saturday week . MARY LENNOX But I ca n't leave now . Colin needs me . NEVILLE The last thing the boy needs is you . Another month of trying to keep up with you and we 'll have to put him in hospital , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . He 's much better . NEVILLE You have no idea how ill he is . When Colin was born , the midwife did n't expect him to live a week . But I , have kept the boy alive for ten years . Only now , thanks to you , he is in grave danger of relapse . MARY LENNOX But you have n't seen how NEVILLE Do you want him in hospital ? Do you want him to die ? MARY LENNOX To die ? NEVILLE Yes ! To die . If Colin is too active at this stage in his recovery , if you push him to take his first step too soon , before his heart is strong enough , he will not survive it . Do you understand , Mary ? Colin 's very life is in your hands . ( And suddenly , LIEUTENANT WRIGHT and MAJOR HOLMES appear . ) NEVILLE One moment , he would be chatting away , and the next moment , he would sink to the ground and die . MARY LENNOX And die ? NEVILLE Yes ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will not see the boy in hospital for the rest of his life , or dead before his life even begins . You must go , and go you will . Now that is all I have to say to you . ( MARY can not answer . But she does n't leave. ) p. 89 NEVILLE Why are you standing here ? Are you quite amused to learn of your power ? MARY LENNOX I did n't do anything . You locked him in his room . NEVILLE You may go . MARY LENNOX You do n't want Colin to get well at all . You want him to die so you can have this house . ( Suddenly , almost out of control , DR . CRAVEN raises his arm , as though to hit MARY . MUSIC CUE #27 : DISAPPEAR - TRANSITION Then he stops himself . ) NEVILLE ( Screaming . ) You will leave Saturday week ! ( MARY runs from the room , and DR .

MARTHA I think you better tell him that yourself . MARY LENNOX I ca n't , Martha . He 'll just get mad and start acting all high and mighty . And then Dr. Craven might send him away , too .
