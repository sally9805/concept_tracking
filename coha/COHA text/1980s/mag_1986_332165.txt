Scandalous , simply scandalous ! That seems to be the reaction that many designers want to provoke with their ad campaigns . Raciness has become so routine that Calvin Klein fills his ads with ever greater numbers of nude bodies , as if to make up for declining shock value . But last week a rival , Perry Ellis , managed to create a fuss with a new tactic for selling men 's cologne : a whiff of vulgarity . An Ellis print ad contains a 260-word monologue , in which a model claims to be so fond of the fragrance that he took a bottle from his employer while flashing " my best f  --  - you smile . " Women 's Wear Daily and the New York Times Magazine banned the ad , though the word was not spelled out . <P> Ellis , for his part , will probably look back on the fuss with his best thank-you smile . The tizzy has no doubt boosted awareness of the ad , which is to appear in six other magazines , including Vanity Fair and Cosmopolitan. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
