I ' ve been to Oz and had a much easier , happier time than Dorothy did when she followed the Yellow Brick Road . Chicago ' s Oz , 2917 N. Sheffield Ave. , is a casual neighborhood club noted for jazz and a world-class brandy selection . Such laid-back sophistication is pure Chicago , and so is the resident wizard , Ozzie Schoenstadt , a most convivial , congenial man who is a walking encyclopedia on the subject of Cognac . Good brandies are produced all over the world , but those made in or near the town of Cognac in the Charente region of France have been considered the world ' s finest since the 18th Century . No one has managed to dethrone the French champion in the 300 years since . Cognac is what brought me to Oz and brought me back again . There are more than 60 different bottlings on display and always a few more squirreled away . Sensibly sized tasting portions of either 1 1/2 ounces or 3/4 ounce make it possible and affordable to compare several on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personalities that members of the Cognac family possess . " Cognac ranks No. 1 because it is the most expensive to produce and costs the most , " Ozzie explains . " It ' s a status thing . But there are other reasons . You can ' t produce a nice brandy fast . It takes time . In Cognac they have the stocks to store and age their brandy properly . Also Cognac is double- distilled . That gives it more finesse than single-distilled brandies . " For the record , Cognac is made from not very distinguished white grapes ( ugni blanc , colombard , folle blanche ) grown in chalky soil in seven strictly defined vineyard areas . The grapes are fermented into wine , then the wine is distilled and aged in oak casks for periods ranging up to 50 years . Each Cognac " house " ( manufacturers such as Hennessy , Remy Martin , Martell and Courvoisier , to name the four that dominate the industry ) blends brandy of different ages to create a house style that is kept consistent from year to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blend to insure consistency of color as well . Letter symbols on each Cognac bottle-in ascending order of age , VS , VSOP , XO are the most common-give an indication of the average age of the brandy inside . " When you sample well-made , well-aged Cognacs , there is no single best . Nothing is right or wrong about any of them , " Ozzie believes . " It ' s a question of your taste and your mood , of the environment you ' re in , of the temperature of the room and the style of the Cognac . " The main trick is to learn to appreciate the ritual . You can ' t just splash back a Cognac . It ' s a really civilized spirit . You have to take your time , warm it in your hands , sniff it , sip it . Repeat the process . It ' s similar to drinking wine . You are attempting to understand the component flavors and how they relate to the taste buds . The fun is in developing your own taste knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range from $3. 80 to $37. 50 , depending on age and rarity . Ozzie claims to have favorites in every price range and will gladly help you find them . He ' s also planning a series of classes for those who prefer structured education . Cognac also has a place in food preparations . Other , sweeter , brandies are better suited for pouring over ice cream or other desserts . Less elegant , less expensive brandies are more economical for quantity cooking . But Cognac provides a haunting aroma and distinctive flavor nuance to simple , elegant recipes that really matter . Here are three . THE TRUE STEAK AU POIVRE Two servings 1 1/2 tablespoons black peppercorns 2 beef filets , about 5 ounces each , at room temperature 1 tablespoon butter 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 tablespoons Cognac 1/3 cup creme fraiche or whipping cream Salt to taste 1 .
