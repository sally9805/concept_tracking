Almost immediately after taking office , he would jolt official Washington by putting before Congress legislation to establish an alternative retirement system , phase out farm subsidies , require people on welfare to work and provide parents with the financial resources to send their children to school wherever they want. // " There are problems that are unsolved , " says the former Delaware governor , a bona fide member of the Eastern Establishment who broke with his family ' s business tradition to enter politics . " There are needs that are unmet , lives that are unfulfilled. " // The " damn right ideas , " as Mr. du Pont calls them , have set him apart from his Presidential rivals . He has chided them for walking around political land mines , while he has set off one explosion after another , campaigning as " Tomorrow ' s Leader " and characterizing himself as the only candidate to address the tough issues. // // Ideas Provoke Debate // Yet so far , Mr. du Pont , not his rivals , has been the main casualty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of the Republican Presidential field . And after a record as Governor that even some Democrats extol , he is being ridiculed for his ideas . Some see them as radical , while others argue that they are far more conservative than those he once promoted. // Mr. du Pont ' s emergence as somewhat of an oddity in the campaign is in itself slightly bizarre. // Pierre Samuel du Pont 4th is the great-great-great grandson of the founder of the E. I. du Pont de Nemours &; Company , the chemical conglomerate . Politically , as a state legislator , Congressman and two-term Governor , he has always been establishment . Personally , he has enjoyed a life of privilege - a summer home in Maine , Exeter , Princeton to study engineering , then Harvard Law School. // Labeling the 52-year-old Mr. du Pont is not easy . Clearly , he has changed . Long-time friends say what they remember most about him as a youth is his shyness . Of all professions , they never expected him to enjoy or master politics . <> <> Churchill Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winston Churchill , whose decisiveness during World War II Mr. du Pont frequently alludes to on the campaign trail. // Even though he is no longer shy , Mr. du Pont still clings to his privacy . He allows few visitors to " Patterns , " his Wilmington estate , and is reluctant to involve his four children in his campaign. // The legacy of the du Ponts , a family that arrived in America nearly two centuries ago from France , weighs on Mr. du Pont , says his wife , Elise. // Mr. du Pont ' s parents were staunchly conservative Republicans . Pierre S. du Pont 3d , called Big Pete , was a vice president and executive board member of the du Pont Company . Pete du Pont ' s mother , Jane , was involved in amateur theatrics . <> <> A Demanding Father // Friends say that as a youth , the candidate would go to his mother for understanding . His father demanded the best of his son . " He would say , ' You know , if you really weren ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because there are people who are not capable ; but you are not one of them , ' " the candidate recalled. // Classmates at Princeton recall that Mr. du Pont on vacations would ride around in his Chevrolet , long before cellular car telephones were developed , pretending to be talking on a play telephone - a humorous side that still surfaces. // He says that he can not recall what happened on a blind date with a Vassar student named Jane Fonda , although one friend from that period says that Mr. du Pont was unimpressed. // He met his wife while he was a student at Princeton and she attended Bryn Mawr . The first time they met , they hotly debated Keynesian economics , although both say they no longer recall the positions they took . <> <> Decides on Law School // Making what relatives describe as an unusual break , Mr. du Pont decided to go to law school . Law was not a profession to which family members aspired. // " It had been a tradition for every male member for generations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tradition that was broken or broken very lightly , " his wife said . " His father was terrified - he didn ' t like lawyers and still doesn ' t. " // Harvard Law School changed him as much as anything , associates say . For one thing , it helped ignite his interest in politics . When he finished at Harvard , he went into the family business as a quality control engineer . He became , as he remembers it , " a little frustrated. " // " The family business is an enormous corporation , and if you have got some ability and if you work hard you can get to the top in 25 or 30 years , " he said . " From the bottom , that ' s an awful long horizon . " <> <> Getting a Political Start // When the court-ordered reapportionment created a state legislative district in his area , he successfully ran . Two years later , in 1970 , he was elected to the House of Representatives for the first of three terms. // Mr. du Pont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more difficult , he said . Delaware ' s tax and unemployment rates were among the highest in the nation , and no governor in 20 years had survived in office more than one term. // By the time he left office in 1985 , the state ' s economy , once ailing , was healthy , with unemployment down to 7 percent from a high of 13 percent . The top tax rate was cut nearly in half , and the state budget had been in balance each year of his tenure. // Even Democrats praise his performance , giving him high marks for improving the economy , pursing pragmatic policies and attracting highly skilled bureaucrats. // " Throughout his tenure there was never any hint of any kind of scandal , " said Orlando J. George Jr. , the Democratic leader of the Delaware House . <> <> First Into the Race // Realizing that there was " a big bite of life " left , Mrs. du Pont said , he began thinking about running for President while in his second term as Governor and was ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sought re-election. // In September 1986 , Mr. du Pont became the first candidate in either party to to enter the 1988 Presidential race . It is a candidacy that has created turmoil in the ranks of the Republican Party ' s far right , where several candidates have been seeking to solidify support. // In a mild surprise , he received the endorsement of The Manchester Union Leader , the New Hampshire newspaper that is a leading conservative barometer , over Representative Jack F. Kemp of upstate New York and Pat Robertson , the former television evangelist. // Since entering the race , Mr. du Pont has detailed a set of biting proposals . Some are more conservative than the positions taken by President Reagan. // " It was one of those strategies that was absolutely dictated by the candidate , " said Eddie Mahe , a Republican political consultant . In short , he said , Mr. du Pont could not match Vice President Bush and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas in terms of experience , so he chose to engage in a battle of ideas. // But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman , said the ideas emerged this way : " We asked him , if you were king and didn ' t have to worry about political repercussions , what would you do ? " <> <> Some Stances Paradoxical // The common strand in the ideas is that each reflects what Mr. du Pont ' s aides acknowledge is a libertarian notion that the best government is one that governs least. // Yet some measures are the antithesis of this doctrine . To fight illegal drugs , he promotes mandatory random drug testing for high school students - a proposal that often draws jeers from high school students and arguments that it would invade privacy and discriminate against younger adults . Offenders would lose their drivers ' licenses. // " When we began seriously thinking about running , the first thing I said is , before you run for President , you ought to decide why you want to be President and what you do if you get there , " Mr. du Pont said recently . " The only thing that would be worth being in that job is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed. " // As he makes such statements before meager audiences in towns throughout Iowa and New Hampshire , the early caucus and primary states on which he is concentrating , Mr. du Pont ' s credibility is an asset . Here is a tall , horn-rimmed patrician , whose net financial worth has been put at $6 million or more , who wants to be President , but says he does not need to be President to feel fulfilled . <> <> Voicing the Fears of Others // Mr. du Pont says , often eloquently , that he speaks the fears average Americans voice around kitchen tables - the frustrated parent forced to send a child to an inadequate school system , or young adults wondering about the viability of social security when they retire . " What drives him is that he is interested in problems and the opportunity to make a contribution that is worthwhile , " said Charles F. Richards , a lawyer and a life-long friend. // But in places like a Manchester diner with a sign warning " No checks cashed , " Mr. du @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways that one. // When he stopped there recently for coffee , orange juice and rye toast and to shake hands , only Garrett Probert , a construction worker , exhibited remote interest in the candidate , telling him , " I like your stand on welfare. " // Mr. du Pont ' s aides argue that his experiences as chief executive helped to cement his conservative views , especially in terms of economic policy . While in Congress , he had supported a gasoline tax and wage and price controls , but as Governor he became a supporter of supply-side economics , lowering the state ' s top income tax rate from 19. 8 percent to 10. 5 percent . Supply-siders argue that tax cuts stimulate economic growth . <> <> Seeing Larger Solutions // Mr. du Pont , whom the liberal Americans for Democratic Action once rated at 48. 6 percent as a Congressman , also signed legislation restoring the death penalty in Delaware . He also initially opposed the establishment of a cabinet-level department for children services , arguing that it duplicated existing state services. // " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stern , his press secretary , who said that Mr. du Pont began to appreciate the need for large solutions to problems rather than trying to win small battles. // Mr. du Pont ' s conservatism is not at issue in the Presidential campaign , only whether it is politically expedient . At Boston College a few weeks ago , he bristled when a student suggested that the Soviet Union might be " morally equivalent " to the United States . The United States , declared the candidate , is a nation of " free people , " while the Soviet Union is a " dictatorship. " // Similarly , he has pounced on Mr. Bush for supporting the agreement to eliminate medium range nuclear missiles . And he now calls his Congressional vote to bar aid to anti-Communist Angola rebels a mistake . He says he now supports such assistance , including aid to the Nicaraguan insurgents or contras . <> <> An Engineer ' s Approach // But the fuel for his candidacy has been the set of sharply debated domestic proposals , which aides describe as rooted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the candidate ' s plan to create an alternative retirement system , Robert M. Ball , a former Commissioner of Social Security , said : " I don ' t understand it . He must be desperate. " // Vice President Bush scored in the first debate of the Republican candidates two months ago by dismissing Mr. du Pont ' s plan as a " nutty idea. " // Mr. du Pont has argued that the plan is necessary because Social Security spending will exceed income in the year 2017 , and the system will be unable to make payments unless it raises taxes or cuts benefits . But Mr. Ball said that he accepts projections that an adequate surplus will exists to cover the difference. // The debate is somewhat secondary . Mr. du Pont ' s acknowledges that the proposals have some problems in terms of how they will be put in effect and what their chances are politically . In the first year of enactment , they would add more than $27 billion to the Federal debt. // But Mr. du Pont said that the whole point is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed , " he said. " but , gosh , if you are going to be President you ought to lead. " //
