For a while , Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone had seemed headed for a forced retirement . Both Japanese and international opinion makers predicted that his chances for a third term in office after this month 's parliamentary elections were all but nil . After the Tokyo economic summit in May , Nakasone appeared to be in deep trouble , having failed to persuade Japan 's major trading partners to cool off the country 's overheated currency . Worse , Japan 's $ gross national product recently declined by .5% , the first such drop in eleven years . His policies of " administrative reform , " aimed at curbing exports , cutting government expenditures and opening up Japan 's domestic markets to foreign competition , were met with bureaucratic resistance at home . Nakasone also bucked Japanese public opinion by pumping up real defense spending by 6.5% a year while cutting back on education and welfare . <P> Thus , the landslide victory of the Prime Minister and his Liberal Democratic Party in last week 's " double " parliamentary elections was not only totally unexpected but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seemed nothing short of miraculous , as it thrust behind him , at least for the moment , the worst of his problems . Moreover , the vote set records : the extent of the Liberal Democratic victory was unprecedented in the party 's 31 years of continuous rule . The L.D.P. candidates won a majority of 304 out of 512 seats in the lower house of parliament , an increase of more than 50 , while the smaller opposition parties suffered setback after setback . In the upper house too the L.D.P. gained eleven seats , giving it a total of 142 in the 252-member chamber . <P> Elated by the scope of his success , Nakasone let loose with some uncharacteristic hyperbole . He called the final tally " this voice of the nation , this voice of heaven , this voice of God . . . " Still , the victory was only a first step toward Nakasone 's goal of extending his leadership for another two years . Now he must begin the tricky task of persuading his sprawling and splintered party to allow him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Japan 's leader . <P> Reaction to the Liberal Democratic landslide was enthusiastic in the West . " A personal victory for Nakasone as well as for his policies , " said Gaston Sigur , U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs . " As a result , Japan can take a more responsible role in the world economic community , commensurate with her strength . " The Prime Minister 's landslide , said the London Times , was a " sign that Japan is becoming both more outgoing and more accessible . " Nakasone , commented the conservative West German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung , " can be sure that the victory of his party and his personal success will be welcomed in the West .
