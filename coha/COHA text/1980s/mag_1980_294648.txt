THE MAGIC LABYRINTH by Philip Jos Farmer ; Berkley/Putnam ; $11.95 <P> The planet is about the size of earth . But there are a few differences : its only river is longer than the Nile , the Congo , the Niger , the Amazon , the Orinoco and the Mississippi-combined . And its inhabitants are not exactly the folks next door . For inexplicably resurrected on both banks of the mysterious river is every soul who ever lived , from hairy cave dwellers to modern Homo sapiens , from the totally unknown to such famous figures as Joan of Arc , Karl Marx and Hermann Gring . <P> Back in 1971 , Philip Jos Farmer abandoned the sci-fi world of space opera with a book that introduced this " Riverworld , " titled To Your Scattered Bodies Go . In a tantalizing curtain raiser , Sir Richard Francis Burton , searcher for the source of the Nile , translator of The Arabian Nights , soldier , swordsman and linguist , dies in Trieste in 1890 ( as did the historical Burton ) . Moments later-or is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank of the river . Burton 's reaction is entirely in character . While other resurrectees stagger about in shock , the world 's most intrepid traveler sets off to find the source of the river and to learn who is responsible for his situation . <P> The auspicious opening was a difficult act to follow , and many Farmerites wondered whether the Riverworld was wide enough to sustain a projected tetralogy . The author 's next works allayed all fears . The Fabulous Riverboat gives Burton some delightful traveling companions . He and the grownup Alice Liddell Hargreaves ( child model for Lewis Carroll 's Alice ) meet a cynical fellow named Samuel Langhorne Clemens , who constructs a side-wheel steamer to voyage upriver . The second volume also introduces Cyrano de Bergerac and England 's King John , who attempted to steal the throne from his brother Richard in real life and who hijacks Clemens ' boat on the Riverworld . But while these two books and the third volume , The Dark Design , drop some clues about the creators of the fantastic planet , none provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tetralogy does , and in the process , insinuates strands of history and myth , philosophy and ribaldry . With a cast of characters that includes Viking Warrior Erik Bloodaxe , Cowboy Star Tom Mix and a deck of World War I Flying Aces , its plot twisted to provide a climactic battle between Clemens and King John , and a final confrontation between Burton and the strange Ethicals who control the Riverworld , The Magic Labyrinth charts a territory somewhere between Gulliver 's Travels and The Lord of the Rings . It also raises a few moral questions . Is Gring a villain or a political puritan who , " once having given his loyalty ... did not withdraw it " ? As for the agnostic Clemens , Farmer writes : " Sometimes , he thought that his belief in determinism was only an excuse to escape his guilt about certain matters . If this were true , then he was exercising free will in making up the explanation that he was n't responsible for anything , good or bad , that he did . On the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humans the illusion that they had free will . " Farmer does not resolve such dilemmas . He is too busy trying to get " all loose ends tied together into a sword-resisting Gordian knot . "
