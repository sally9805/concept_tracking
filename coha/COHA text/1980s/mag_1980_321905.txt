Alice Roosevelt Longworth 1884-1980 <P> She was 17 when she first went to live in the White House in 1901 , and they called her Princess Alice , and she , as she later recalled , " looked upon the world as my oyster . " When a visiting notable whose dignity had been offended by Princess Alice 's sprightly interruptions asked her father whether he could not control his daughter , Theodore Roosevelt gave him a stern answer . " I can do one of two things , " he said . " I can be President of the United States or I can control Alice . I can not possibly do both . " <P> When Alice Roosevelt Longworth died last week at 96 , Washington remembered her as a woman of great charm and elegance . It remembered her glittering marriage to House Speaker Nicholas Longworth and her years as the capital 's reigning grande dame . But most of all it remembered the malicious wit that prompted her to keep in her upstairs sitting room a pillow embroidered with the message , " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right here by me . " <P> Mrs. Longworth may indeed have been the most caustic critic of Washington celebrities in her own long lifetime . A sampler : <P> Of Calvin Coolidge : " He looked as if he had been weaned on a pickle . " * <P> Of Franklin D. Roosevelt : " One-third mush and two-thirds Eleanor . " * <P> Of Thomas E. Dewey : " How can the Republican Party nominate a man who looks like the bridegroom on a wedding cake ? " * <P> Of Wendell Willkie : " He has sprung from the grass roots of the country clubs of America . " <P> To Senator Joseph McCarthy , who made the mistake of calling her Alice : " The policeman and the trashman may call me Alice . You can not . " <P> To Lyndon Johnson , who complained that her wide-brimmed hat made her hard to kiss : " That 's why I wear it . " <P> Of the statement that she herself was the nearest thing to royalty : " Oh , pish ! Utter nonsense ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> *She did not claim to have invented these anonymous gems but did give them wide currency .
