NEW YORK  --  ITT Corp. said it expects to report a 50% increase in profit for the second quarter , primarily because of the sale of assets . Excluding gains on the sale of assets , earnings would increase by more than 10% for the period , the company said . It wouldn ' t estimate revenue for the quarter . A year earlier , net income was $78. 3 million , or 52 cents a share , on revenue of $5. 3 billion that included $1. 7 billion from the insurance and finance businesses . Profit for that period was about 50% below the 1983 quarter . The company , which said it will announce its results Aug. 1 , wouldn ' t say how much it would gain from the sale of assets . But analysts estimated the gains at about $100 million , after taxes . An ITT spokesman said the gains would be partly offset by charges that he declined to specify . Analysts suggested ITT might report a loss on the sale of Pennsylvania Glass Sand Corp. , terms of which haven ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the company ' s quarterly results . " The earnings were so low last year they can ' t help but improve upon them , " said Phua K. Young , an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc . Among the other transactions completed by ITT during the period were the sale for about $400 million of 12 industrial technology companies to Forstmann Little &; Co. , an investment firm specializing in management buyouts ; the sale for about $80 million of publishing operations to MacMillan Inc. , and the sale for $300 million of a 48% stake in Abbey Life Group Ltd. in Britain to the public . The sales are part of a previously announced plan to divest the company of $1. 7 billion in assets to reduce debt and focus on high-technology and service operations . Through the second quarter , about $1 billion in assets had been sold , ITT said . Previously announced sales of additional operations are pending . ITT declined to disclose figures , but analysts attributed improvements in operations in part to stronger results by its troubled Hartford Insurance unit , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our second-quarter results , following the increase in earnings per share in the first quarter of this year , indicate that our business is on course , " Rand V. Araskog , chairman and chief executive officer , said . ITT has come under pressure from some holders , including Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs , to find ways to increase profit . In a statement , Mr. Araskog said ITT is " closely watching " its office-equipment business , which is part of the company ' s telecommunications unit . That unit , hit hard by strong competition , saw its earnings plunge 88% to $16 million in 1984 from $138 million in 1983 . Mr. Araskog also said results will include expenses reflecting costs associated with adopting its System 12 telephone switching system to the U.S. market . The system , a big seller in Europe , is the cornerstone of ITT ' s telecommunications drive in the U.S. Mr. Araskog also said sales of the company ' s XTRA personal computer line are " now on budget . " The company cut prices on its personal computers in April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wall Street Journal
