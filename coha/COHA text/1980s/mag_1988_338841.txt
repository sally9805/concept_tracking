MOTHER AND DAUGHTER WAIT on a New Orleans park bench for their respective buses to arrive . Every working day , the child takes one bus to school , and the mother rides another to work . When the vehicles pull up , mother and daughter part company , as usual . But the girl realizes she has left her school books on the bench , and she runs back to retrieve them . By now the mother has boarded her own bus . With a maternal premonition of danger , the woman tries to get off . <P> " I could see two men jump out of a car and grab her , " says the mother . " I yelled at the bus driver to let me off . When he turned toward me , he was wearing a hood , and his eyes were big flames of fire like he was the devil . He was laughing and would n't open the door . I could n't get out of the bus , but I could hear my daughter yelling . " The bus drives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up screaming . She sits upright in bed . Leonard Howard , her fiance , is also awake . " Leonard says to me , ' It 's only a dream , ' " Sherri reports . She is a 25-year-old single mother . Bianca , 9 , the girl in the dream , is her only child . That night Sherri can not fall back asleep . Months later , the dream still haunts her . <P> Themes of danger and escape , often through fantasy , are woven into the textures of Bianca 's life . " Sometimes I have problems sleeping , " says Bianca , a shy , sensitive and self-centered child . " Like I sweated one time . All you could see is wetness . " Was she sick ? " No . But then it reminds me of when that girl got bitten on Fright Night . She started turning ugly , and then it was like she was sweating . But the only movie that scared me was The Exorcist . That scared me . Her head turned all the way around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed the priest . You see the devil was inside of her . Some people say it was like a true story that really happened . " <P> Does she believe it ? " I do n't know , " says Bianca shyly . Her mind is stocked with what she has learned from television and movies . Bianca says she wants to go to college because if she does not , she will " end up like that lady in a cartoon " who sings because she did n't finish school . But she will not take science , for fear of burning her hand in a lab , " like that woman on The Young and the Restless . " She talks about the bad effects of cocaine and reveals that she learned about the subject from a TV movie called Desperate Lives . <P> Bianca feels safe when she is at home in front of the television . When Jem , a shapely , superstar rock singer who is the title character of her favorite cartoon show , shakes her radiant pink hair and makes her magical red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jem embodies what Bianca would like to be as an adult : sexy , a singer and a success . " I do n't want to be a maid at hotels when I grow up , " says Bianca . " That 's what my auntie is . She works for a hotel in the French Quarter . I want to be a singer like Jem . I 'm going to have some red star earrings like Jem 's , but they do n't have to be magic or powerful . "
