BRUBAKER <P> Directed by Stuart Rosenberg <P> Screenplay by W.D . Richter <P> It seems clear that Robert Redford has decided to place his talents and his star 's clout more or less in the service of ideals he believes in . Though he is happy to entertain an audience , it had better be in the context of a story containing a liberal , humane moral . Somehow his roles - whether as investigative reporter or up-the-organization cowboy-suit him in his maturity , as they do not most other leading men , about whom the sweet odors of Bel Air and Rodeo Drive cling . There is something of the authentic knothead about Redford . <P> Brubaker , which is about the efforts of a warden to clean up what looks to be the foulest and most corrupt prison in America , is not as close to everyone 's concerns as All the President 's Men was , nor has it the knockabout charm of The Electric Horseman . But it is an often powerful film . Its most potent passages come at the beginning . Redford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison in order to experience conditions there firsthand before he takes over as warden . Since I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang almost half a century ago , moviegoers have periodically been made painfully aware of how rotten life can be on a Southern prison farm . Director Rosenberg had a good go at the subject in Cool Hand Luke ( 1967 ) . But never has the food looked so disgusting , or the living conditions so vile , as they are shown here . Nor have the reprisals and punishments been more brutally demonstrated . Also , the fact that the Brubaker character is modeled after Thomas Murton , an academic penologist who took over an Arkansas prison in the 1960s , gives the film a documentary urgency that its predecessors have lacked . <P> Brubaker , like Murton , discovers that the horrors of prison life are not waste products of idle sadism ; they are manifestations of a wider corruption . The penalty for exposing these evils is death - a sentence carried out by the venal trusties and implicitly condoned by their civilian counterparts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery of the victims ' graves that brings Brubaker to its ambiguous climax . <P> In return for silence on the murders , Brubaker is offered a deal that would give him the money to put into practice all the reforms for which he has been campaigning . He refuses , evidently on the grounds that one can not make deals with a system so mired in evil . The movie , though sympathetic to his stand , stops short of full endorsement . A larger good might have been accomplished through compromise . <P> The moral argument is not long or preachily dwelt on . Nor is a romance that might have developed between Redford and Jane Alexander , playing the Governor 's aide who got him appointed . One sees the spark flash between them and then watches them immediately suppress it , as men and women often do when a larger task is at hand . Both are excellent , as are Yaphet Kotto and David Keith as prisoners trying to decide if they dare to give their trust to Brubaker . One might wish that Director Rosenberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stillness would have served this grim film better .
