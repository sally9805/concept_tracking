Giorgio Armani defines the new shape of style <P> Just the name . . . the name alone . . . the very mention of the name sends off sparks and sets up a clamor like a French fire drill . " Giorgio Armani ! Except for white truffles , pasta and opera , the Italians ca n't be credited with anything ! " <P> Pierre Berg , partner and protector of Yves Saint Laurent , peeks over the battlements at the enemy force below and , as if panicking , fires off a salvo before he has found his aim . " Give me one piece of clothing , one fashion statement that Armani has made that has truly influenced the world . " <P> <P> Alors , Pierre . The unstructured jacket . An easeful elegance without stricture . Tailoring of a kind thought possible only when done by hand . The layering of fabrics by pattern , texture and color so that clothing takes on for a second the quiet shimmer of a 17th century Japanese print . Surprising combinations of garments-leather pants as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a vest worn over a coat-that scramble clichs and conventions into a new and effortless redefinition of style . A functional celebration of fabric . A reshaping of traditional geometry with witty contours , sudden symmetries and startling vectors . A new sort of freedom in clothes . An ease , the Armani ease . And that , as we say in French , is just for les openers . <P> The temperament is understandable . Berg has a legend to burnish and a business to run . He sounds like a man who knows strong competition when he sees it taking a stroll down the boulevard , decked out , more than likely , in some splendiferous Armani assemblage . The fact is , Saint Laurent remains the pale eminence of high fashion , in part because of his undisputed creative coups over the years , in part because of his huge volume of business and the relentless mythologizing of the fashion press . The fact is also that while Saint Laurent 's contributions have been generative and historic , he has often appeared to be treading water ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has made a huge splash reshaping and restructuring the way people dress-not only the people who wear Armani designs but those who wear the myriad clothes influenced by him and those whose very ideas about clothing are colored , in some cases unconsciously , by the Armani attitude . <P> This all may not be a matter of great moment . But it is very much a matter of the moment , and what may now seem like a temporal fancy can become , decades hence , a tactile key into the past . Clothes are the fabric of history , the texture of time . And this time , right now , belongs to Armani .
