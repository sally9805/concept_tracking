HONG KONG  --  Police investigating the collapse of two Hong Kong financial institutions said they found evidence that $21 billion in illegal overdraft checks circulated through the international banking system between 1977 and 1982 . The scheme affected two U.S. institutions , American Express Bank Ltd. and Citibank , they said . The illegal arrangement , which police began looking into three years ago , allegedly involves officials of two local financial institutions , Hang Lung Bank and Dollar Credit &; Financing Ltd . The extent of the fraud appears to dwarf a recent U.S. case in which stockbrokers E.F. Hutton &; Co. admitted to illegally writing about $4 billion in overdraft checks over a two-year period . All the checks in the Hang Lung-Dollar Credit case were written by a local businessman , John Mao , and all of them were drawn on accounts at U.S. branches of three major international banks , the police said . Using bad checks to cover other bad checks , Mr. Mao and six alleged co-conspirators obtained the temporary use of hundreds of millions in interest-free funds over the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities have released few details about the case . More information could emerge today when Mr. Mao , who has pleaded guilty to fraud and agreed to testify for the prosecution , is expected to be sentenced . Three of his alleged co-conspirators are awaiting trial , while the others are being sought by police . All seven men are former officers or shareholders of Hang Lung , Dollar Credit or their holding companies . The check-kiting , which came to light largely by accident , raises fundamental questions about international banking practices . Questions about how the check-kiting scheme lasted so long without arousing suspicion , why regulators failed to detect irregularities within Hang Lung and Dollar Credit and how to prevent it from happening again likely will be pressed on authorities here and in the U.S. as more details emerge from the investigation . In Washington , a spokesman for the Federal Reserve Board said the central bank knew nothing about the involvement of U.S. banks in a check-kiting scheme . A spokesman for the Comptroller of the Currency said that U.S. officials who supervise multinational banks received a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as yet , hasn ' t been involved . " We ' ve been made aware of it , but right now we ' re not part of it . It ' s the Hong Kong authorities that are doing this , " the spokesman said . So far , it remains unclear how much money has been lost and by whom . In previous court appearances , government prosecutors have said that the check-kiting arrangement resulted in direct losses equivalent to more than $128 million to local financial institutions . Such direct losses aren ' t likely to include lost interest fees that banks would have earned had the overdrafts been drawn through regular credit lines . This is where the Dollar Credit-Hang Lung case differs from E.F. Hutton ' s . The branch and regional employees of the U.S. company who wrote overdraft checks against uncleared deposits were aiming to improve E.F. Hutton ' s interest income , and indirectly their own compensation . In the case of Dollar Credit and Hang Lung , the prosecution is alleging that the defendants siphoned off funds purely for their own use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearing checks between Hong Kong and U.S. banks . According to the Hong Kong investigators , Dollar Credit and Hang Lung would give Mr. Mao immediate credit for a bad check . He then had the use of the funds for several days . Before the U.S. banks debited his account , Mr. Mao would draw another bad check on one of his U.S. accounts , the Hong Kong banks would cash it , and he would use the funds to cover the first check . The case was exposed largely because of a brief run on Hang Lung Bank in September 1982 . When banking regulators scrutinized Hang Lung ' s books to ensure that it was sound , the bank withdrew from the overdraft arrangement . With a crucial link in the chain broken , Dollar Credit got caught with some of the bad checks . The deposit-taking company collapsed two months later . Dollar Credit ' s failure , in turn , pushed Hang Lung Bank into insolvency a year afterward , triggering a government takeover of the bank . According to the charges against Mr. Mao , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three Panama-registered companies he controlled , and all the accounts were at bank branches in the U.S.-American Express Bank Ltd. in New York , and Citibank and Banque Indosuez in Chicago . There isn ' t any evidence to suggest that officers of any of these banks were involved . for the three banks , making them unwitting beneficiaries of the check-kiting . In Hong Kong , a spokesman for Banque Indosuez declined to comment on the case . Similarly , a Citibank official referred inquiries to Hong Kong authorities . Citibank officials in New York also hadn ' t any comment . At the local American Express branch , William Blomquist , its chief executive , pointed to the bank ' s long-standing association with the Mao family and said there probably wasn ' t much his bank could have done to prevent the fraud . " The Maos have been clients with us since the 1950s , " he said . " And over that length of time , you build up a high degree of trust .
