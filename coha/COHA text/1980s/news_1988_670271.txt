Best Products Co. agreed to be acquired for $27. 50 a share in a leveraged buy-out by the New York investment firm of Adler &; Shaykin . The discount retailer ' s shares shot up $6. 125 to close at $26. 875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday . Adler &; Shaykin , which has used similar buy-out plans to gain controlling interests in Joy Manufacturing Co. and Chicago Sun-Times Co. , said it would make a tender offer for all of Best ' s 24. 9 million shares outstanding for about $684. 8 million . The assumption of Best ' s debt and expenses connected with the offer are expected to bring the total funds needed for the acquisition to about $1. 1 billion . Financing is to be provided by Manufacturers Hanover Trust and Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. The agreement appears to end weeks of takeover speculation about the company . Late last month , Best rejected as inadequate an unsolicited bid of $21 a share , or $522 million , from a company it didn ' t identify . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to review five formal offers . Best ' s chairman , Robert Huntley , said the board accepted the Adler &; Shaykin bid because it was the highest and had " no unwanted conditions . " Adler &; Shaykin has indicated it will keep the company ' s management team in place and won ' t make major changes in operations . " I don ' t anticipate any spinoff of assets , " Mr. Huntley said . Leonard Shaykin , a managing partner , said the firm " doesn ' t have a precise game plan " for Best , but it has a " number of ideas " it eventually will discuss with management . Mr. Shaykin said his firm ' s general approach " is not to break up companies or dramatically change operations . " Under terms of the agreement , Best will pay Adler &; Shaykin $25 million if the transaction is terminated " under certain circumstances . " In addition , Best will reimburse the buyer for its out-of-pocket expenses up to $7. 5 million . Mr. Shaykin praised Best management for " a wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of its business . We would like to continue that . " Mr. Shaykin said the strategy will be to " strengthen their current business " by improving Best ' s merchandising . He declined to discuss specific steps his firm might take . In 1986 , Best undertook a major restructuring , selling 49 unprofitable stores and taking an extraordinary charge of $42 million for the year ended Jan. 31 , 1987 . That produced a loss of $25. 6 million . A year later , Best posted a profit of $30. 5 million on sales of $2. 07 billion . Like others in the catalog-showroom business , Best has been hurt by stepped up competition and better service from such traditional discount retailers as K mart Corp . When Best surfaced recently as a merger or takeover candidate , Service Merchandise Co. of Nashville , Tenn. , was cited frequently by analysts as a likely buyer . In August , an investment group including Prospect Group Inc. , another New York leveraged buy-out fund , disclosed it held a 9. 9% stake in Best and might seek talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor Best ' s Mr. Huntley indentified any of the four other bidders whose offers were considered Friday . The price offered by Adler &; Shaykin surprised analysts who had predicted the Richmond , Va. , company might fetch in the low $20s , given the company ' s flat sales and its concentration in the mature catalog showroom business . R. Hutchings Vernon , an analyst with Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. in Baltimore , said management " got a very good price  --  about $4. 50 higher than I thought it would be . " The biggest challenge for new owners , he said , will be to increase sales while maintaining recent improvements in gross margins . Mr. Vernon also predicted that Adler &; Shaykin might concentrate on Best ' s jewelry business and mail-order operations , particularly office products for home offices or small businesses . Michael Mead , an analyst with Scott &; Stringfellow Inc. in Richmond , Va. , said Adler &; Shaykin might try to tap the value in Best ' s real estate , but it will be acquiring a mature business that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of The Wall Street Journal
