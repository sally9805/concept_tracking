On June 1 of this year , when the Panama Defense Forces ( PDF ) announced that Chief of Staff Colonel Roberto Diaz Herrera had retired , no one in Panama thought the action voluntary or doubted who had engineered it . For years Diaz had been locked in a silent struggle , masked by public protestations of brotherhood in arms , with PDF commandant General Manuel Antonio Noriega , who heads the military government . Noriega had many times sought to ease out Diaz , his second in command , and in September 1985 , after the murder of Dr. Hugo Spadafora ? an outspoken man who had accused the general of cocaine trafficking ? Diaz had tried and failed to have Noriega ousted . Now , it seemed , the contest was settled for good . The PDF , after all , was the source of all power in Panama , its high command Panama 's master , its personnel a privileged caste . By law , anyone in the country could be jailed for thirty days without a hearing Guillermo Sanchez BorbOn is a columnist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government last summer . He is now living in exile in Miami . upon being accused by a PDF member of " lack of respect . " Any sergeant had more real clout than the marionette of the moment installed in the presidency , while high rank conferred quasi-divine authority ? immunity from all earthly comeuppance and endless chances to strut and bluster , to enrich oneself without either risk or effort , to develop and indulge sadistic urges . In his heyday Diaz had blustered as bravely as any . His specialty was browbeating civilian officials . When procurator Rafael Rodriguez began actually to investigate a $30 million theft from the Social Security funds , instead of just going through the motions as he 'd been ordered , it was Diaz who told him to stop or he would be murdered . Rodriguez resigned and fled the country . When Ricardo de la Espriella , the puppet president , balked at restaffing the cabinet so that the budgets of certain ministries could be looted for funds to fix the 1984 election , it was Diaz who told him to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ? Was he sure they were safe ? De la Espriella resigned . And it was Diaz who hounded the next puppet president , Nicolas Ardito Barletta , from office in 1985 for proposing to appoint a special commission to investigate the Spadafora murder . But power went as well as came with the uniform ; retirement constituted political gelding . Purged officers rook the sop that was always offered and quit . Diaz had been promised a million and the embassy in Tokyo for his ego . Everyone supposed he would go quietly . On June 5 , four days after his announced retirement , a local TV station aired an interview with him . Late that evening , unhappy with certain cuts , he sent a complete tape to the independent daily La Prensa , asking that the text be published quickly , in its entirety , in the following day 's ( Saturday 's ) edition . The editor , Winston Robles , reviewed the tape and found nothing earthshaking ; what there was could wait till Sunday . Diaz , finding nothing in his Saturday paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to publish . The remark annoyed Robles . He 'd been fighting military dictatorship in Panama since the day it began ? on October 11 , 1968 , when General Omar Torrijos Herrera seized power ? and had suffered exile , calumny , and death threats . As for the paper , its presses had been sabotaged , its offices raided , its staff beaten by goons , its writers harassed , and its publisher forced to leave the country . Robles reminded Diaz that until last week , he seemed to think La Prensa was n't scared enough . If you 've got anything important to say , Robles told him , we 'll put it on page one tomorrow morning . Diaz told him to send a reporter . He was going to make sensational disclosures . The first was that his house , a half-milliondollar mansion in the swank Altos del Golf section of Panama City , with spacious grounds and a bulletproof master bedroom and gold-plated fixtures in the master bath ? the house had been bought with his share of the funds from one PDF racket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The PDF , he declared , had numerous rackets . It was n't healthy for an officer to be honest . General Torrijos , the former dictator and Diaz 's cousin , who 'd been killed in a 1981 plane crash , had told him as much . Honesty had n't been Torrijos 's problem . He 'd taken a $12 million bribe from the Shah of Iran for granting the shah asylum in 1979 . And , yes , the 1984 election was crooked . The last touches of fraud were applied in Diaz 's home . And , oh yes , Noriega had arranged Spadafora 's murder . Sensational disclosures , no doubt about it , but not for reasons an outsider would expect . Not a word was news to Panamanians . Everyone knew the PDF big shots were stealing . Look at their houses , look at the way they lived ! The visa scam had been going since 1980 , a traffic in human misery run in cahoots with Fidel Castro , involving up to 4,000 Cubans in Panama at any one time . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid up to $3,500 for a transit permit , only $15 of which reached Panama 's treasury . La Prensa had done a feature on it in April , but even without that everyone knew . The 1984 election ? Everybody knew the election was phony , that Nicky Barletta lost by thousands of votes , that half the government 's legislators lost likewise . Despite all the pressure , all the intimidation , all the people 's tax money dumped in , the PDF 's handpicked candidates had lost . Why else had the vote count taken over a week ? Why else was it made in secret instead of in public as the law stipulated ? Why did the president of the Electoral Tribunal refuse to certify it and resign instead ? Why else when the people demonstrated , demanding a fair , open count , were they fired on by government goons ? The body count was three dead , forty-two wounded . Hugo Spadafora ? The man had said Noriega trafficked in cocaine and had recently met with U.S. drug-enforcement officials to tell them about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noriega in all things , had vilified Spadafora and predicted his doom , in particular his death by beheading . He was arrested in front of witnesses and taken into the PDF compound in ConcepciOn , in the north near the border . Next his corpse was found , missing the head , in Costa Rica . If Noriega was n't involved ? everyone thought he was ? why did n't he try to find the culprits , or at least allow an investigative commission to be appointed ? Only a moron would waste breath asking such questions . Of course Noriega arranged the murder . Some revelation ! What was news was that one of the thieves was talking . For nineteen years thieves had run the country . They yapped about Panama 's sovereignty while they were selling it ? visas , asylum , the whole country for sale . But now , at last , one of them was talking . No one could be fooled anymore . No one could even pretend to be fooled , not even those outside Panama . Like Jimmy Carter , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights when the night before the PDF had raided the university ( some students had intended to protest Carter 's visit ) and murdered a student leader named Jorge Camacho ; and when that very morning , twelve miles away in the town of Chorrera , soldiers had beaten a man to death for exhorting others not to go to the rally . Like former U.S. Ambassador Everett Briggs , who had congratulated the Panamanian government on the purity of the 1984 election . Like U.S. commander in Panama General John Galvin , who had accepted a medal from Noriega only a week before Diaz began talking . The news , then , was that there 'd be no more pretending . The Defense Forces were corrupt . They defended nothing but their own privilege . The puppet president Eric Arturo Delvalle Henriquez and his government were illegitimate . The strongman was a perverted assassin . And the United States would soon stop supporting him . He would be left with only those who were bound to him by greed and terror . o , or better , what is Manuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In October 1968 , Panama was peaceful and prosperous , with a good and growing measure of social justice . The new president had won a wide mandate in an honest election . His last three predecessors had been chosen democratically and had served out their constitutional terms . The only significant issue concerned sovereignty in the U.S. ? controlled Canal Zone , and that issue tended to unify Panamanians , and therefore was a source of social cohesion . Manuel Antonio Noriega was a lieutenant in 1968 . He 'd attended Institute Nacional , Panama 's best public high school . He had wanted to study medicine but could n't afford to . A scholarship to Peru 's military academy came up . Manuel Noriega went off to Lima . Upon graduating , he returned to Panama and entered the PDF as a sub-lieutenant . Assigned to Colon , at the Atlantic terminus of the canal , he raped and beat up a prostitute ? the first sign of the Noriega we 've come to know . He would have been cashiered , but a captain named Omar Torrijos saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Costa Rican border . There he raped a thirteen-year-old peasant girl and beat up her twelve-year-old sister . Omar Torrijos saved him again . Others , too , saw his potential . By 1968 he was in his second year on the CIA secret payroll . The PDF was then little more than a police force . That it had even that much strength was the United States ' idea . Washington had decided that the way to stabilize Latin America was to pamper its military castes . Panama had none , which was largely the reason why it was peaceful and prosperous , also democratic , also stable ; but for ten years our good neighbors to the north had been trying to grow one on the formula Training plus Toys yields Esprit de Corps and Elitism . You say we could have objected , turned down the money . I say Dr. Frankenstein should n't go around making monsters . In any case , the new president of Panama was concerned about the PDF and meant to purge its more rambunctious officers . Before he could do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took office . They also suspended the constitution , dissolved the legislature , seized control of the media , abolished political parties , and exiled those who complained . Then they set about transferring political power to the PDF and economic power to themselves . Many Panamanians disliked this program . Some , in Chiriqui Province , went beyond mere complaining , took up arms and went into the mountains . Manuel Noriega was promoted to captain and put in charge of pacifying the region . Which he did , evidently with gusto . He was an enthusiastic torturer of prisoners and a conscientious supervisor who demanded proof of performance from those in the field ? an earlobe , say , lopped or clipped from the guerrilieros they claimed to have pacified . The Last , Best Hope for Mankind ( it must be noted ) was no obstacle to the snuffing out of freedom in Panama . Not in the slightest . The United States recognized the new regime in a twinkling , and helped Omar Torrijos take control of it , and gave him every possible aid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toys ) . As for Captain Noriega , he was promoted to major . Torrijos 's trick was to combine the rhetoric of populism with the politics of greed . Such rhetoric was devoted to the question of sovereignty in the Canal Zone , but this had been sought by every government in Panama 's history and needed no dictator to think it up . Negotiations toward a new treaty had , in fact , been in progress for four years when the PDF seized power . Torrijos used the sovereignty issue as a rationale for muffling dissent and in the end sold out Panama 's aspirations for benefits to the PDF . Now as for greed , Torrijos 's actions were more eloquent than any rhetoric . In the name of social justice and development , the state entered the economy on a grand scale . The lot of the common man worsened . Growth dropped from 8 percent to minus . But Torrijos and his colleagues and cronies all became rich . Why should n't they ? Who was going to stop them ? The country 's finances were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation . Prominent complainers were packed off into exile , obscure ones knocked about or made to vanish . Every kind of scam was practiced . Fortunes were amassed . Meanwhile , the regime bought up potential opponents ? businessmen on the right , intellectuals on the left . Everyone loved Torrijos , everyone money could buy . Corruption seeped into every crevice of Panama . Student and labor leaders went on the payroll . Every ministry bulged with unneeded employees , every budget with phantom consultants who showed up only to get their checks . The Torrijos regime became a money junkie . Foreign banks were the pushers ; they will deserve to lose their money if default comes . And where was Major Noriega while all this was transpiring ? By 1970 he was in the capital , and a lieutenant colonel , and chief of intelligence . Our intelligence , while working for the CIA . But Panama was n't singled out for betrayal . He also spied on Cuba and Nicaragua , and while spying on them spied on his Uncle Sam also , turned National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embargoed electronics components to the Soviet bloc . Do they still say " fink " in New York City ? In Panama we say sago ? toad ? and there 's a certain honesty to Noriega , or maybe it 's chutzpah , for his office was full of little ceramic sapos , toad figurines . As Sally Quinn of The Washington Post tells it , when she visited Noriega in his office , he took one look at her and excused himself and came back reeking of eau de cologne ? a natty little guy in a blue business suit , bouncy , full of energy , victim ( it 's true ) of a bad acne problem , so that his cheeks look like the landscape at Verdun , so that the people call him Cara de Pifia , Pineapple Face . The office wherehe received Quinn also had a huge blowup photo of Noriega himself ? his shoulders anyway , and part of his profile ? going out an airplane door during parachute training supplied by our good neighbor to the north . A good story is told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely elected then deposed ( in 1968 ) president Amulfo Arias Madrid . A priest was made to vanish in the early 1970s ? rumor was he 'd been chucked from a plane into the Pacific ? so when Arias visited Noriega and saw the photo , he said ( having chutzpah himself ) , " I assume that 's the last picture of Father Gallegos . " At which everyone ducked , as in an old-time Western when someone calls Black Bart a liar , but Noriega just sat there grinning , hands held at his chest , " Heh , heh , heh . " Yes , indeed , an interesting monster . Monster enough by 1972 for the Nixon administration to consider assassinating him . This from John E. Ingersoll , Nixon 's director of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs . Noriega , you see , was in the drug trade . In those days the drug was heroin , coming from the Near East to Paraguay ( where Ricord of the French Connection had set up after being hounded from Marseilles ) , then on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drug has been cocaine . As , for example , in June 1984 , when more than a ton of cocaine ? more than a ton ! ? flew north from Panama , sealed in seven Sanyo meat freezers marked " perfume , " on board an Inair Cargo Airlines ' DC-8 . The cocaine never got snorted because a dog sniffed it in a warehouse near Miami International Airport . The drugs belonged to the Colombian cartel bosses , for whom Noriega provided the following services : safe passage for such goods through Panama ; safe facilities for doing business ; safe haven when Colombia cracked down on them after they 'd had the justice minister murdered . For millions and millions of dollars , according to a pilot who flew one payment worth over a million from Colombia to Noriega . ( Noriega seems to have laundered drug money too . An investigation of that is in progress in Tampa . ) When Torrijos was killed in the plane crash , command of the PDF passed to Florencio Flores . Who was betrayed and forced out by Dario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manuel Noriega , no doubt to the great delight of his CIA handlers . As if they controlled him ! As if he were their SOB ! Noriega promoted himself to general and set about reigning as the uncrowned emperor of all Panamanians . The country was a shambles , of course . Mortgaged to the nth generation . Twenty-five percent unemployment in the capital ; 40 percent unemployment in Colon . No matter , Noriega was happy . So , too , was the Last , Best Hope for 60 H.ARPER 'S MAGAZINE DECEMBER Mankind , with a strongman it could pretend was its SOB , and permanent bases for which it paid not a nickel , and , look , under pressure from the U.S. Senate , the relegalization of political parties , the return of free speech ? all in return for ratification of the canal treaty ? just in the right spot , a fig leaf of democracy ! Then Hugo Spadafora went and shot his mouth off . And left Noriega no choice : Hugo had to be murdered . Beheaded , no choice there either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How else could Noriega enjoy being emperor ? How could Noriega sleep soundly if he did n't have Hugo 's head under his pillow ? And now Roberto Diaz had betrayed him , just because he 'd betrayed Diaz and forced him out . No , indeed , its not easy being a monster . Being a monster is n't all fun . sor , was there . Where he stood was no mystery . He 'd been exiled back in the ' 70s , then allowed to return after members of the U.S. Senate made partial democratization the condition of their voting to ratify the canal treaty . He 'd been beaten almost to death , leading a demonstration against the shah in December 1979 ? beaten and kicked by the PDF on Avenida Central in downtown Panama City in front of hundreds of people . When Bernal recovered , he voiced his opposition to dictatorship on the radio and caused the regime such trouble it banned him for life from speaking over the air . So he took his program into the street and broadcast by bullhorn every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bernal knew where he stood , and so did everyone else . He was at Diaz 's house far into the night . So was Aurelio Barria , the president of Panama 's chamber of commerce . Like Bernal he was in his late thirties , but there the resemblance seemed to end . Barria was a businessman , new to opposing dictatorship . Bernal had been putting that first for his whole adult life . But Noriega was about to make Barria just as implacable an enemy as Bernal . Earlier in the year Barria had been out to the Philippines as an observer of that country 's first free election since its dictator 's fall . He saw a parallel between Marcos and Noriega . He was at Diaz 's house the moment the colonel started talking . As Diaz 's confessions appeared , on Sunday , June 7 , then in expanded form on Monday and Tuesday , Panamanians began reacting to them . Noriega and the state-owned media said Diaz was crazy . Opposition leaders , as surprised as anyone else , first said his charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale of electoral fraud and began calling for a recount , Among those who joined in was Nicky Barletta , the fraud 's chief beneficiary for eleven months , from October 1984 , when he took office , until September 1985 , when he was tossed out . Another unfamiliar voice deploring the fraud was Omaira Correa , who had been elected to the legislature in 1984 and who 'd formed part of the regime 's majority . She was an instant convert to Diaz 's views , and not only called for a recount but invited the people of Panama to gather at her radio station on the afternoon of June 9 and march to the Electoral Tribunal and stay there shouting until a recount was made . Alarge number of citizens answered this socialist Popular Action Party . Dr. ( of medicine ) Arnulfo Arias Madrid ? three times president of Panama , the president deposed in 1968 , and the true winner of the 1984 elections ? tried to show up but was prevented . Also attending were a large number of riot troops . These soldiers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like Darth Vader 's henchmen in Star Wars . Their elite company ( if so martial a term may apply to thugs whose only opponents are unarmed civilians ) is officially designated " Doberman " ; members have the Doberman pinscher 's head as insignia on their trucks . But we nonmartial Panamanians call all riot troops " Dobermans . " Some of them often carry tear gas and shotguns . All carry plastic shields and rubber hoses . The latter are four feet long , willowy , yet quite substantial . An easy flick with one to thigh or buttocks will raise a welt the owner may cherish for days , while a healthy swat on the crown can cause brain damage . Citizens of the United States will be comforted to know that this equipment is paid for , at least in part , by their tax dollars . Instead of waiting for the demonstrators to approach their lines , as was the usual practice in such confrontations , the Dobermans attacked while the crowd was still gathering . Arias Calder ? n was hosed to the sidewalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain age , was not only hosed but dragged across the pavement , so that her legs were considerably scraped . Others were similarly ill-treated . All , it must be noted , were making nonviolent use of their constitutional right to assemble publicly . The crowd dispersed speedily , but instead of staying dispersed as was usual practice , rallied and flung taunts at the Dobermans . There ensued a tremendous street battle , such as Panama was to see many of in the weeks succeeding , in which the citizens took all the punishment yet seemed lighthearted , while the Dobermans grew frustrated and more vicious ; in which citizens retreated precipitously as though headlong in flight , then flowed back whenever the firing stopped . The Dobermans fired birdshot and tear-gas grenades , the former most conspicuously through the stained-glass front window of the National Sanctuary Church , where a number of citizens took refuge ( for the battle spread out in all directions from its epicenter on Via Espana ) , the latter most tellingly into people 's faces . Those who were shot , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choked . Those who were hosed yelped loudly and fled if they could . Yet , paradoxically , the citizens ' taunts seemed to hurt the Dobermans more than the Dobermans ' weapons hurt the citizens . The Dobermans , who mainly advanced , appeared fearful . The citizens , who mainly retreated , did not . And , overall , the Dobermans , sweating terribly in their heavy fatigue suits , panting through their gas masks in the tropic heat , seemed more to be pitied . This odd business continued apace until nightfall . That same evening , the opposition 's chief political instrument was fashioned . Its origins , like those of the crisis itself , went back to September 1985 , and the murder of Spadafora . For a popular person to be ( as the autopsy showed ) fiendishly tortured , then slowly beheaded while still alive , might not cause much indignation in certain parts of Latin America ? and thus might seem to North American observers insufficient grounds for political turmoil ? but we Panamanians are a gentle people , far more squeamish than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the least because it departed entirely in its perverted cruelty from the country 's traditions and norms ) was a class of young business executives who had grown up under dictatorship and were not as yet active in public affairs . For them the murder , coming on top of years of blatant corruption and the 1984 electoral fraud , was a sort of threshold . They could not be bystanders any longer . What they did was begin a campaign for decency , for the " restoration of moral and civic values , " through the clubs they belonged to : Rotary , Lions , Kiwanis , and the like . This campaign was not directed openly against the government . Its main focus was the problem of drug abuse . But Noriega took it personally . The president of the 20 ? Thirty Club was briefly jailed on trumped-up charges . The president of the Rotary Club died in mysterious circumstances . The official verdict was suicide , but both of his wrists were cut to the bone , something one simply ca n't do unassisted . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the government 's charges that the crisis had been provoked and was being manipulated by partisan political figures to serve their ambitions , veterans of the decency campaign , meeting at the chamber of commerce and with businessman Aurelio Barria as their chief organizer , formed the National Civil Crusade . Twenty-six organizations were represented , including the Catholic Church . Another thirty-nine joined in the next few days . The communiqu ? that was issued promised a campaign of civil disobedience , repudiated the cowardly and brutal repression " performed by the Dobermans that afternoon , and called for the immediate removal from office of all those implicated by Colonel Diaz until an investigation of his charges had been completed . As the crisis continued , the Crusade became more and more important , while the opposition 62 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE / DECEMBER parties and their leaders moved into the background . However , Dr. Zdniga of the Popular Action Party made at least one more prominent contribution . On the radio on the morning of June 10 , he called upon citizens to show their disapproval of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 6:00 P.M. each day . A final touch came about by spontaneous generation . At six that afternoon not only were pots beaten and horns honked ; white handkerchiefs were waved all over the city . Litde.groups of smiling citizeris.stood on street corners throughout the capital waving white handketchiefs , while cars went by with horns honking and people stood in house windows beating pots . Thus the three " P " s of anti-Noriega militants : paila ( pot ) , pitG ( horn ) , and panuelo ( handkerchief ) . All announced sedition , and the last made your Doberman rabid . This became clear on Thursday , June 11 , but by then two important things had happened . On Wednesday night , after a day of street violence in which seventy-odd citizens were wounded by birdshot and one lost an eye , the Crusade called for a general strike . In response , at twenty minutes past midnight on Thursday morning , the government declared a state of emergency and suspended the rights to freedom of movement , expression , and assembly ; and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state 's obligations to abide by legal formalities . Arrested persons no longer were required to be informed of the charges against them . Nor were they entitled to benefit of counsel , or to process writs of habeas corpus . Dawn found the capital occupied by Dobermans and the citizenry apparently cowed , but at noon people began beating pots , honking car horns , and waving white handkerchiefs , and at the last the Dobermans went wild . Along Fiftieth Street in the banking district ? Panama has become quite a banking center , over 130 banks , though the present crisis will probably fix that ? the strike did not appear to be having much effect . Government pressure kept most businesses open , and the state of emergency looked as though it had many people thinking twice about showing opposition . But at noon , during lunch hour , people came out onto the sidewalks and began waving handkerchiefs . The Dobermans hosed , gassed , shotgunned , and arrested them , and perpetrated much violence against property . Aurelio Barria was arrested just after noon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce . He spent the next five hours in the Balboa Police Station , naked , with a hood over his head , being shouted at by a number of angry voices , berated , taunted , vilified , threatened . Besides being threatened with death , he wasthreatened with rape . The death threats were vague , the threats of rape specific . And here we have a peculiarity of the Panama Defense Forces since the ascension of General Manuel Noriega , a trait , no doubt , imparted by their commander . mean the PDF 's obsession with rape . Rape heterosexual or homosexual , by proxy , or just via threat ? may even have replaced bribe-taking as the chief incentive in a PDF career . When I was jailed in February 1986 , I was assured by several PDF members , as well as by cell mates , that I would be raped as soon as it got dark , and though 1 am past sixty and scarcely alluring , I did n't doubt their sincerity in the slightest . Luckily for me , friends secured my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the crisis 1 am describing suffered rape while in PDF custody , and as far as I have been able to gather , not a single person detained for political reasons has been spared the threat of rape , often with the guarantee that it would be performed by AIDS carriers . Barria was not intimidated by his experience . Neither was the populace . Noriega is training Panamanians to be stubborn , and if he is not removed from power quickly he will succeed in training us not to be gentle . In any case , his attempts at intimidation became ridiculous at noon on Friday , the twelfth of June , when a special mass was celebrated at the Church of El Carmen at the request of the Crusade . Noriega had the church surrounded by troops in battle dress and camouflage face paint , bristling with hand grenades and automatic weapons . For all their firepower they seemed ill at ease , mainly eighteen year olds from the countryside out of place among peaceful citizens on Via Espana and the palm-lined Avenida Federico Boyd . The churchgoers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome attendee , Susan Davis , daughter of the United States ' ambassador to Panama Arthur Davis . This gentleman , a former Denver businessman , a former county chairman of the Colorado Republican Committee , had by his actions during the crisis given proponents of democracy cause for hope . His embassy had reacted to Diaz 's charges with a communique supporting efforts to " get all the facts out in a manner that is fair to all , " and simply by standing for truth and justice Davis had set himself well apart from the four preceding U.S. envoys to Panama . On Thursday morning , when troops surrounded the home of Arias Calder6n , in effect putting him under house arrest , Ambassador Davis paid Calder ? n a visit ( having first called Delvalle , the puppet president , and said he was going to ) and thereby caused the troops to be withdrawn . Now he was giving the opposition further comfort , for no one could believe that his daughter ? the first lady , as it were , of the embassy , since Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ambassador ( and , by extension , the government he represented ) approved . ereignty " rally was called for the ninth of July and all stops pulled out to generate support for it But when the Crusade called a march of its own for the tenth ? five marches , in fact , each starting from different parts of the city , all converging at the Church of El Carmen ? it was soon clear the numbers were not with Noriega . So the puppet president Delvalle went on TV proposing a truce . Pots were beaten all over Panama even as he was speaking . No truce , replied the Crusade , till Noriega got out . So Delvalle issued a decree banning both marches , an unconstitutional decree since all rights were in place . Pots were beaten again . The Crusade said it was marching . And the hour of the wolf came to Panama . You may have seen part of it on television , the people in white carrying white flags , walking toward the lines of visored soldiers , walking forward and being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women in white , filling the street and stretching blocks and blocks backward , being shotgunned and pressing forward , being shotgunned again . On Via Espana beside the Republic Bank building , and on Via Argentina near the university , and on Samuel Lewis at the Sanctuary , and on Calle 50 . On Federico Boyd the route went steeply uphill , and the Dobermans were on the crest , so the marchers broke and dissolved at the first volley , but elsewhere they pushed forward again and again . Under a brilliant sky , on an afternoon refreshed by pleasant sea breezes . Panamanians attempting to exercise their rights to public assembly and freedom of transit , offering no violence , merely receiving it . How many marched ? At least one hundred thousand . Fortunate country , so little , but with so many rich ? And all along the five routes people watched from their windows waving white handkerchiefs , and draped white towels and bedsheets from the sills .

Rushed forward shooting and hosing , arresting people . Fired at the windows that showed white . Fired tear gas into buildings and shot people as they fled . A large number of marchers took refuge in the Sanctuary , which might have done them some good in medieval Europe , but not in Panama this July . The Dobermans fired tear gas in through the windows and shotgunned people point-blank as they tried to get out . Drove them back in and gassed them . Shotgunned them point-blank as they tried to get out . Just people , you understand . Not insurgents or foreign invaders . Then charged into the church , shotgunning and hosing left and right ? inside the church , you understand ? and 64 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE / DECEMBER grabbed people and dragged them out , and flung them into patrol trucks and took them to prison , beating them on the way . Paramilitaries , too , were out , though on no one 's TV footage . They traveled that afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city as if by diabolic conjuration ? sleek-skinned assassins in jeans , in fatigue trousers , many with little numbers tattooed on the inside of hairless forearms .

And fired them into windows . And smashed doors in to shoot people in their own living rooms . And dragged men out and flung them into the vans . Prisoners were taken that weekend all over the capital : marchers , people whose houses showed white , men with white shirts on . A Lloyd Aereo pilot , a Bolivian , stepped out of the Hotel Continental to see what the fuss was and got grabbed and taken to prison . A young Belgian , in Panama to see his fianc ? e , was plucked off the street and beaten severely . Everyone with white on was at risk , liable to wind up in Modelo Prison . Ah , La Modelo !

The first stop for those taken on the tenth was a holding pen on the ground floor , la preventiva . Which was staffed with a dozen or more of the regular prison residents recruited by the guards as a welcoming committee . As each political detainee was shoved in , he was assaulted and robbed . Robbed of valuables , naturally , but also perhaps of his shoes and/or of his shirt , of whatever took one of the robbers ' fancy . Some were robbed down to their underwear .. And of their gold fillings if they had any . The gold , the money , and the pawnable loot ( watches and wedding rings mostly ) were passed through a slot in the wall to a guard outside , for the actual robbers got but a small share of the proceeds . And above the slot was a window that gave on the guard room , from which the guards browsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet square , with a tap in one wall and two scoop-out toilets ? bowls , that is , without plumbing . By nightfall 300 men were packed inside . In the morning political detainees were told they would get six months confinement . All would get the same . No trials would be necessary . None had been allowed to see a lawyer . None had been advised of the charges against him . Next stop was the galleries . There are four of these . Each runs an entire floor , has an aisle in the center with cells opening off it . The cells are not locked , but no one can get out of his gallery . Dantean symmetry applies : the least bad of the galleries is on the top floor , the worst in the basement . Political prisoners were put in one at a time . Again they were robbed , though now the guards got no part of the proceeds . On the other hand , very few had anything left worth stealing , which sometimes made the regular residents angry . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some , however , found the criminals apologetic the guards had made them abuse political prisoners . Ah , La Modelo ! It might have worked , the Crusade might have been paralyzed , if the detainees could have been held hostage in those hideous conditions , but the events on the street , and reactions to them , were reported by the independent media . An immense stink arose at once . The whole business was entirely un-Panamanian , as the murder of Hugo Spadafora had been . " Beyond all the limits of necessity , " said Archbishop McGrath , and others joined in . All those taken on the tenth were released on the fourteenth . The effect of it all was to make the opposition tougher , and to convince Noriega that free speech had to go . There may , however , have been an ancillary reason for the pain inflicted that weekend . The Crusade 's persistence in marching on July 10 personally discomfitted Panama 's emperor . He had to cancel the festivities planned for the eleventh . His daughter 's wedding was celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base at Fort Amador , with only a handful of guests in attendance . A clear and palpable humiliation ? and what was he going to do with all that champagne ? Good reason , in short , to make his enemies suffer . Drunk and tearful , he complained that Diaz had ruined his life . He 'd take care of that son of a whore for sure . He knew he might have to leave power , but a lot of Panama would go with him . Noriega teetered . The Pentagon had apparought to remove him . He was the only obstacle to a settlement of the crisis and a menace to the health of the institution . Were these acts by Paredes spontaneous ? I think not . They look like part of an orchestrated effort , a U.S. attempt at cut-rate defenestration . A way of making plain that Noriega had lost U.S. backing , and at the same time assuring the PDF that it was n't the target . Thus would Noriega 's colleagues be nerved to toss him out . Paredes 's son had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) by Noriega , and Paredes had done nothing . For Paredes to act when he did , the fix had to be in . Whatever the case , that Saturday the jubilation that had come to Panama nearly two months before , at the start of the crisis , returned redoubled . The gringos were dumping Noriega ! The Defense Forces were dumping Noriega . He was finished ! Panama was going to be free ! What crossed no one 's mind , however , was that Noriega 's PDF colleagues , though thieves , had already stolen a great deal of money and were more concerned with living to enjoy it than with stealing more . They knew perfectly well that Noriega was an obstacle , and a menace , and whatever else one wished to call him . They knew Noriega better than most , and the knowledge very likely gave them nightmares . He is not the sort one risks annoying idly . And suppose they risked and were successful : Where would they find a leader as ruthless as he to keep the PDF in power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The PDF 's health was worse than Paredes suspected . The PDF , and Panama with it , had lost the ability to excrete . By Sunday the euphoric mood was fading . There was no sign of anything happening inside the Defense Forces in response to Paredes 's actions , and that morning a twenty-four-year-old law student named Eduardo Carrera became the first fatality of the crisis first confirmed fatality , for there were people missing to go along with the more than 1,000 wounded or imprisoned . Carrera had been arrested on July 10 and badly beaten . His mother , a widow , sent him to the town of El Valle , ninety miles from Panama City , in part so he could recuperate , mainly from concern for his safety . At about 3:30 A.m. , he and some other youths were outside a cantina in the center of the town when two PDF corporals arrived , armed , in uniform , and drunk . " Down with Pineapple Face ! " someone shouted . Corporal Eliecer Almengor drew his pistol . " Take it easy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shot him in the stomach . Under crowd pressure , our two heroic defenders took Carrera to the town 's health center , but finding the place empty they left him on the floor and fled . Carrera was dead on arrival at the hospital in La Chorrera . That afternoon wild rumors gripped the capital . Three buses full of convicts from the penal colony on Coiba Island had been seen headed east on the Pan-American Highway ; they would be brought in after dark and let loose in the city . And so on . What Noriega was actually up to , however , was worse . At twenty minutes to midnight troops occupied the offices of La Prensa , Extra , and El Sid ? , as well as Radio Mundial and Radio KW Continente . Employees were hustled out and the places padlocked . These media , the regime announced the next morning , were accused of having issued calls to sedition . They would stay closed until the investigation was concluded . At 4:00 A. M. , Monday morning , troops of the Batallon 2,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Panama is to take over the canal ) began blocking off the streets around Roberto Diaz 's home in Altos del Golf . At 4:40 they opened up with machine guns at barricades Diaz 's guards had set up at the corners of his block . The guards fired back for a few minutes , then withdrew to the house . There were fifty-three people inside , including five minors , four of them Diaz 's children , one his nephew . Diaz moved them all into his bedroom . He and a few other men went into the master bathroom , whose window gave on the street . He had his guards put their weapons in a closet . According to those with him at the time , he could n't believe the PDF , troops he had led , would assault his house with his wife and children inside . He thought the attackers were paramilitary goons of Noriega 's and did n't want them provoked . At first light , troops who had moved in around the house began firing tear-gas grenades through the windows while riflemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two helicopters appeared overhead and began taking turns strafing the house with M-60 machine guns . Some spent bullets penetrated the bedroom , but the ceiling armor held . The main problem was tear gas . People breathed through handkerchiefs kept damp from the bathtub . Sometime before 6:30 A.M. the firing stopped . A man called out over a bullhorn identifying himself as a state prosecutor ; he called on Senor Diaz to surrender " for the good of your family . " Diaz called back for the troops to be withdrawn . " You wanted it this way , " the voice called back . Tear gas and rifle fire resumed , followed shortly by machine-gun and explosive fire ( probably rifle grenades , perhaps bazookas ) against the house walls . Just after 7:00 A.M. there were two loud explosions . Commandos of the anti-terrorism unit had blown in the front and rear doors . At that , the fire became intense . The next thing those inside knew , commandos were in the - bedroom . Diaz and the others with him were brought outside into the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butts . Diaz 's wife , her mother , and the children were taken to the Venezuelan Embassy . The others , forty-six in all , were put under arrest . Noriega , in short , was n't finished .
