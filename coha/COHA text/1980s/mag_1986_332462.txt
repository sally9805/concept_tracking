A seat will guarantee a legislator the chance to sit through hours of grueling haggles in a smoke-choked committee room , and to be besieged mercilessly by hordes of lobbyists afterward . But the upside is irresistible : an opportunity to make history by deciding the details of a bill that will touch the wallet of just about every citizen . And so the most coveted ticket in Washington has become a seat on the House-Senate conference committee that will meet , probably the week of July 14 , to put in final shape a radical overhaul of federal tax law . With billions riding even on technical provisions , says Norman Ornstein , an expert on Congress at the American Enterprise Institute , the tax-bill negotiations " will be the conference of the century . " <P> In one sense , to be sure , the outcome seems virtually foreordained . That some sort of sweeping tax revision will be enacted this year became a near certainty early last week when the Senate passed its version of tax reform , 97 to 3 . The lopsided vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public imagination to develop an overwhelming momentum . It appears almost inevitable that the conference committee will indeed resolve differences between the Senate bill and one that the House whooped through by voice vote last December . The committee compromise should clear both chambers by Labor Day , and President Reagan will undoubtedly sign the final product into law . By now no one dares become known as the politician who killed tax reform . <P> But what kind of bill will it be ? The Senate and House measures have the same broad outline : each would lower and simplify income tax rates and offset the revenue loss by killing hundreds of exceptions and deductions . Yet they differ in dozens of all-important details . One example : the House bill preserves but the Senate measure ends for most people the deductibility of annual contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts . Should the Senate version prevail in conference , that one provision would cost taxpayers $25.5 billion over the next five years . <P> With so much at stake , Senate Finance Committee Chairman Bob Packwood and House Ways and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cochairmen of the conference , are mulling unconventional ways of choosing other conferees . Normally , the most senior members of the Senate and House committees would be selected , but Democrat Rostenkowski is considering appointing his closest allies , senior or junior . Republican Packwood , in contrast , talks of bringing along all 20 Senators on the Finance Committee to face as few as eight Representatives . That would not pack the conference , however , since all decisions have to be approved by a majority of the delegates from each chamber , voting separately .
