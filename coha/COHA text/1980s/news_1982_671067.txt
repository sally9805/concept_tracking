Mr. Slayton , known as Deke , packed up his memories this week , those models of airplanes and spacecraft he has flown and of the space shuttle that age will not let him fly . He took the awards and photographs off his office wall , including pictures of the seven crew-cut astronauts of 1959 . Some of the pictures were faded , like the memories . He left on Friday without fanfare , which is Mr. Slayton ' s way. // The heroes ' pedestals and resounding cheers were phenomena of the early space age that Mr. Slayton did not quite comprehend then and chooses not to dwell upon now . He was simply a flying man . All seven were . They were chosen from among 500 skilled test pilots to respond to the 1957 Soviet challenge of Sputnik and , not incidentally , it turned out , to fill a troubling void in the American psyche. // Mr. Slayton interrupted his packing last week to recollect that April day in 1959 when the Original Seven were , in a sense , unveiled by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington . They felt honored , and bewildered . <> <> ' Kind of Overwhelmed ' // " I think we all - well , I should just speak for myself - were kind of overwhelmed by the whole damn thing , " Mr. Slayton said in an interview at the Johnson Space Center . " I didn ' t have any concept at all of what we were getting into from the public relations point of view . I thought I know what we were getting into from a technical point of view . At that first press conference , I had absolutely zero comprehension of what we were getting into until we were in it , and I didn ' t know what I ' d been through when I got through with it. " // The other six of the Original Seven made their flights and departed years ago . Alan B. Shepard Jr. , 58 years old now , is a wealthy businessman and real estate entrepreneur here in Houston . Virgil I. ( Gus ) Grissom died in the Apollo launching pad fire in January 1967 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator from Ohio , and some say a potential President . Scott Carpenter , 56 , Walter M. Schirra Jr. , 58 , and L. Gordon Cooper , 54 , are engaged in a variety of business and consulting ventures . <> <> Persevered Because of Adversity // Mr. Slayton , who turns 58 Monday , stayed on . Adversity accounted , in part , for his perseverance . A minor heart irregularity dashed his hopes for a flight in 1962 in the one-person Mercury capsule ; all the others flew the Mercurys . The NASA news releases at the time said Mr. Slayton was " keenly disappointed , " a euphemism for feelings he expresses today in the barnyard idiom. // But Mr. Slayton stayed on , becoming head of the astronaut corps and , in 1975 , winning a trip on the Apollo that joined with a Soviet Soyuz in the first international manned space mission. // " It was just one hell of a lot of fun , " Mr. Slayton said of his one space flight . " It just tortured you because you ' d missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there again , it ' s better to have a chance to do it , whenever , than not to have a chance to do it. " // Even if he had been able to fly in space earlier , like the others , Mr. Slayton said , he probably would have remained in the program anyway , unlike the others . <> <> Likes Flying Full-Time // " I guess I ' m probably one of the few in the bunch that likes flying full-time as a career , " Mr. Slayton said . " I probably enjoy flying more than anybody else in the system . I ' d have stayed on as long as I thought I had a chance to fly some. " // After his Apollo-Soyuz mission , Mr. Slayton turned to the space shuttle program . He became manager of its orbital test flight operations . This , he thought , might be his chance for another flight . He ran almost every day to maintain flying trim , at 165 pounds. // Mr. Slayton ' s rugged outdoorsy face , with deep lines bracketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice coming from the stone face conveyed abiding disappointment , without anger or apparent self-pity. // " I was hoping I would get in line for a shuttle flight , " Mr. Slayton said . " When I got through looking at the crew assignments there , and considered my age , I kind of had to bite the bullet here about two years ago . I talked to a lot of people about what they thought my chances were for a flight . I didn ' t get any encouragement at all . " <> <> No Word Meant No Job // Some of his friends and associates wonder why matters were not handled better . Since May 1980 , Mr. Slayton , like several older managers in the agency , had been on temporary status as a rehired retired person . This arrangement allowed eligible employees who had reached the space agency ' s pay ceiling to keep working and getting increases in their pensions . But NASA never responded to a request by the Johnson Space Center to extend Mr. Slayton ' s employment for another year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced he was leaving. // Mr. Slayton has lined up two part-time consulting jobs , to Space Services Inc. of Houston , which is trying to build the first private enterprise launching system , and the Aerospace Corporation of El Segundo , Calif. , which primarily advises the Air Force , especially on its expanding space program. // Mr. Slayton said he would miss the " stick time " in the T-38 jets that astronauts fly between here and the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and to other training sites . But he has an ambition to race midget propeller planes and would like to design his own , as he did once as an aeronautical engineering student at the University of Minnesota. // With Mr. Slayton ' s departure , the astronaut corps now numbers 79 , more than half of them selected in the last three years for the many expected shuttle missions . Many are young enough to be Mr. Slayton ' s children . Several are doctors or scientists with no particular piloting skills . Six are women . <> <> Only One Original Seven // There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only one Original Seven . " Oh , we see each other once in a while , " Mr. Slayton said . " Saw Gordo and Scott down in Florida last fall for a weekend . I see Al off and on around here . Wally comes by once in a while , drops in for an evening . We tag up periodically . Talked to John on the phone last week . It was the 20th anniversary of his flight. " // In " The Right Stuff , " a book about the seven Mercury astronauts and test pilots as a special breed of men , Tom Wolfe , the author , likens the Original Seven to warriors in the days of knighthood . One warrior stepped forward to battle a single warrior from the opposing army . Alone , they put themselves at risk in behalf of their countries. // Mr. Slayton said he " never , ever looked at it that way at the time . " But he , and the other six , did wonder at their singular fame . In retrospect , Mr. Slayton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the public psychology was , why all this big thing about us. " // Mr. Slayton said that he never finished reading the book , however . He said he had his mind more on flying than on the past , even his own special past. //
