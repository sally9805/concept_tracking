A lawyer ' s chief function is to wrench the law around , through argument , to align with his employer ' s interest . Whatever else a lawyer is , he is this . As Dean Richard Huber of Boston College Law School put it , " To some extent , lawyers are hired guns . " In America , we take good care of our half-million lawyers . We depend on them for almost everything and we pay them well . But we don ' t trust them . Lawyer jokes are legion , and a Harris poll on public confidence in public institutions published last November ranked the legal profession near the bottom . This is nothing new , of course . In 1516 , the English lawyer and man of letters Sir Thomas More wrote of his fictional Utopia : " They have no lawyers among them , for they consider them ( to be a sort . . . whose profession it is to disguise matters . " There can be good reasons to distrust particular lawyers , but the distrust of lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious awareness of their double loyalty : Abstractly , they are officers of a court , servants of justice , but practically , they are servants of the client . This isn ' t their fault ; it is the nature of the law itself . The law is clear and impartial only in statute books . In life , where it engages with particular circumstances and facts , it is ambiguous , hence subject tointerpretation . In general it is for the court , not the lawyer , to decide which of several interpretations is " true . " A lawyer must know how to argue even a weak case , even , if it comes to it , a case he detests . And , of course , he has to make a living . All lawyers , whether corporate , civil , or criminal , encounter the two- master dilemma . " It is , " says Professor David L. Shapiro of Harvard Law School , " pervasive in a lawyer ' s life . " Some lawyers never think about it , a few agonize over it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in varying degrees , conversations with lawyers reveal the dilemma at work.MARK COVEN Mark Coven , a poverty lawyer , says , " I love the profession because it allows me to seek justice for a particular class . " Coven has a corner room in the elderly services office of Greater Boston Legal Services , Inc . ( GBLS , called " Gerbils " ) , at Two Norway Street , Boston , around the corner from Symphony Hall . An ascerbic Feiffer cartoon about Reaganomics is taped to his office door , and over his desk is a Day-Glo bumper sticker : " Stop Reagan ' s War on the Poor . " Coven , who is 30 , is one of four senior attorneys in the office , and besides his personal caseload , his responsibilities include programwide management and supervision of other attorneys . GBLS is a nonprofit corporation that provides free legal services to persons who can not afford to retain private counsel . It represents clients in landlord-tenant disputes and consumer problems , but most actively in advocating client rights for government benefits . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and six neighborhood branch offices . Stories of Vietnam-era activists who " go respectable " are legion . Coven has done that to a degree - he wears neat business clothes and works in a modern office - but his social activism and his career path have been linkedfrom the start . He was reared in Brookline and graduated from Union College in 1972 with a degree in politics . During his undergraduate summers and thereafter , he worked as a community organizer for the National Welfare Rights Organization in Atlanta , organizing food cooperatives and rent strikes and working on desegregation cases . He went from Union to Boston University Law School without a pause , graduating in 1975 . After terms as a judge ' s clerk in New Hampshire and an assistant to former New Hampshire Senator John Durkin , he joined GBLS . Legal aid for poor people is not a new idea . There had been a Boston Legal Aid Society since 1901 , quietly dispensing assistance to individual applicants in one office downtown . During the heyday of the US Office of Economic Opportunity ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assistance Corporation was set up with federal funds under the aegis of the Legal Aid Society to provide services more aggressively in neighborhood offices . That parallel structure split off , under the present name , in 1974 , when the autonomous US Legal Service Corporation was established to get legal services out of OEO politics . John Brooks , a senior partner in the firm of Peabody and Arnold and a past president of the Boston Bar Association with a long involvement with legal services old and new , described the opposition to this departure on the part of the legal establishment : " The new breed , spawned by the War on Poverty and the turmoil of the sixties , was more reformation-minded and socially forward- looking . They wanted to branch out and get into major ( class action* cases . There was skepticism about whether ( the more activist approach* could work , a fear of the unknown , a fear that it would be a waste of money . " The class-action suits were duly brought , and some had landmark results . One , against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Garrity placing the BHA into receivership , a decision , says John Brooks , that " will cause a major reform that could have been brought about in no other way . " Mark Coven successfully argued two class-action suits in federal court , one requiring the Massachusetts Office of Communities and Development to revise its eligibility rules for fuel assistance , and another involving the way in which so-called in-kind income can be counted against Social Security benefits . The establishment opposition to poverty law and free legal services has vanished , officially . But lawyers with fee-based services may still be somewhat suspicious . Newton Esdaile , while not criticizing poverty lawyers directly , suggested that their zeal may contribute to clogged court dockets . " Anytime something is free , " he says , " you have to expect people to take advantage of it . " John Brooks says , " Some judges feel that legal service lawyers have pushed too hard on technicalities , further than one would expect in the case of a private client . This can pose an ethical problem : how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t the controlling factor . " For legal services lawyers this is not the problem , it is the solution . " I didn ' t get into this for the money , " Coven says . His salary as a senior attorney is $21,000 . He says he took a 50 percent pay cut four years ago when he left Senator Durkin ' s staff , and he is just now regaining that level . Liberation from the client fee greatly minimizes the two-master dilemma . Barbara Sard , another GBLS senior attorney , puts it this way : " The fact that we don ' t have to worry about the price lets us work more hours than a client could pay for . If we believe there are issues that need research , we do it without worrying about sending the client to the poorhouse . " Of course they are paid , but by the corporation , not the client . Coven talks a lot about the need for " alternative dispute resolution measures , " and in this he reflects the GBLS approach that made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an office waiting for a client to present himself so that a suit can be brought , Coven and the seven other lawyers in the elderly division go into the community and speak at nursing homes and senior centers , informing people of their rights and legal remedies in nutrition , housing , and human services . " A lot of elderly people are isolated , " he says , " and so an outreach effort is required . " GBLS also intervenes " in all forums , " as Coven puts it , trying to protect the rights of the elderly at an early stage , instead of letting bad laws or regulations be written , then suing when their effects are felt . Coven is acting chairman of the state Medicaid Advisory Board , which advises the Department of Public Welfare on policy development , and he has represented nursing home residents in advocating budget and program changes before the Legislature . In the GBLS approach , law is a substitute for political action . " I wanted to get into the legal profession , " Coven says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courts could play in fashioning a better life for people with no other place to turn . The political process doesn ' t work for the poor , but the courts have always viewed themselves as the protector of discrete insular minorities . " Barbara Sard says , " Our way of viewing our job is to see ourselves as advocates of the client population . " Critics suggest that legal services lawyers , in their activist approach to the law , are the modern equivalent of ambulance- chasers : Their role is at least sometimes , as they see it , to induce litigation . But again , liberationfrom the client fee makes legal services lawyers a class apart : They are not bound by the barratry rule. - Still , this freedom can pose problems . Dean Huber of Boston College described the temptation of the legal services lawyer , in his zeal to serve the greater interests of the client population , to " push for a certain result when the individual client may be willing to compromise . " Former Harvard law professor Derrick Bell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Serving Two Masters , " described this conflict in the context of school desegregation cases : " The lawyers ' freedom to pursue their own ideas of right may pose no problems as long as both clients and contributors ( to the civil rights organization paying the lawyers* share a common social outlook . But when the views of some or all of the clients change , a delayed recognition and response by the lawyers is predictable . " Coven admits the potential for this conflict arises , such as when a nursing home resident is being abused but is afraid to take legal action for fear of retaliation . He argues , though , that the legal services lawyer must follow the client ' s wishes , just like any other lawyer . " There are nursing homes that I would like to take to the limit , " he says , " but I have to understand that the client is going to have to live in this situation after I ' m out of it . The whole basis of legal services is that people must must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies , and not their lawyers . " Although liberation from the client fee reduces the two-master dilemma , it does not eliminate it . The poverty lawyer ' s commitment to the " client population " leaves him in the same situation . " Suppose a client comes to you who is getting minimal benefits , " says Coven , " but needs them for survival . Then you discover that he has a separate bank account that he didn ' t tell the Department of Welfare about , that ' s he ' s being overpaid . Do we report him to the welfare department ? " Here is the whistle-blowing question again . But at least the poverty lawyer does not have to include the loss of a fat fee in his calculations . " We would have to inform the client , " says Coven , " that what he ' s doing is illegal , instruct him that he has to report this income . If he doesn ' t accept our advice , we have to make the decision as to whether we can in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to withdraw . " The relation of a lawyer ' s fervor to quality of service is an individual question . James St. Clair of Hale &; Dorr is legendary for his detachment ( he was once described as " all case and no cause " ) , yet no one suggests he represented Richard Nixon more or less ably than he did Benjamin Spock . For Mark Coven , fervor seems to be the key element . " I came here with a commitment to one side and one group , " he says . " I couldn ' t represent the other side as vigorously and passionately and self-confidently . " J. NEWTON ESDAILE J. Newton Esdaile believes the best defense is a good offense . Esdaile , senior partner in the Boston firm of Esdaile , Barrett , and Esdaile , has been called the dean of the Boston personal injury bar . One tort lawyer says that for fifty years in Boston , " if you ' ve got a leg off , you go see Newt Esdaile . " Today " Newt " Esdaile , 77 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still relatively active . He is neat , natty , friendly , and forceful . Known as " the Silver Fox , " he is a legend in the tort field . ( Webster : " Tort : injury or wrong done someone . " ) Graduated from Boston University Law School in 1927 , he had ideas of being a corporate lawyer , but he soon discovered that to get into corporate law in that era you had to have family connections . He did not , so he went into personal injury and product liability , where the demand was enormous and the level of competence low . As late as World War II , says Abner Sisson , a lawyer and contemporary of Esdaile , " competent civil trial lawyers were nonexistent . Lawyers were delighted to have someone with competence who would take these cases . " ( Most of Esdaile ' s clients came to him from other lawyers . ) Lawyers who know Esdaile says the key to his success is preparation . " He works harder than anyone else , " says Stanley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades . " He ' s not a genius . He takes above-average talent and works very hard , plugs away , leaves no stone unturned . A case will revolve and revolve in his mind until he has an intelligent solution . He ' s a classic example that success in a lawyer is in preparation , not in being Perry Mason . " Esdaile ' s volubility does not leave room for many questions , and those asked are sometimes answered elliptically during an interview . The moment the mistrust of lawyers was raised , however , he launched a vigorous , many-pronged apologia , citing today ' s stringent educational standards , the high averages of law school applicants , various salutary changes in legal procedure , and what he believes to be a high and still-rising level of integrity as proof that today ' s lawyers are a noble breed . It is not surprising that Esdaile rose so forcibly to the defense . Tort lawyers are often accused of abusing the law by clogging dockets with " nuisance suits , " like the $10 million suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed the recent strike caused them " mental and physical anguish . " Some say the incidence of such suits is exaggerated , while others - many lawyers included - believe they are paralyzing the court system . Newton Esdaile does not deny that ill-founded suits occur ( suits bycollege teachers denied tenure , he conceded , " are to some extent flooding the courts " ) , but his attitude seems to be that the mass of lawyers is so admirable that the significance of such incidents is negligible . He dealt briskly with the question of crooked lawyers . " There are some bad apples , just like there are bad electricians and bad plumbers , " he says . But he thinks lawyers are getting more ethical all the time , and he relates this to training and intelligence . Lawyers are better trained and more intelligent than ever , he argues , and " a lawyer ' s success is directly proportional to his integrity . He has to struggle for believability and truthfulness at every stage in trying a case . Some of the greatest settlements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying and perjury they lose all reason . " Part of Esdaile ' s aggressive defense reflects his long involvement with legal education ( he is a trustee emeritus at BU Law School ) , which naturally tends to make him an apologist for the profession . But part of it undoubtedly reflects his age and experience . With fifty years in the law , he is old enough to remember when the contempt and mistrust of lawyers was amply justified . In praising lawyers nowadays , Esdaile recalled the days when you could go to law school right out of high school or even by correspondence . " For years , " says Esdaile , " we tried to get the Legislature to raise the standards . But they would always say , What about Abraham Lincoln ? ' " As late as the fifties , there was still at least one sitting Massachusetts judge who had not attended law school. - If tort lawyers in general have reason to be defensive , personal injury lawyers have even more reason . The ancestor of the modern personal injury lawyer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ siren in hopes of drumming up business ; in so doing he often committed the offense of barratry : incitement of litigation . ( Some say the ambulance-chasers are unfairly maligned , that they performed a valuable service in advising an ill- educated population that they could sue . ) Barratry and the filing of frivolous suits are obviously near cousins ; the common link is a money-making approach to the law . Esdaile was loath to talk about money , though he seemed to be at pains to prove that he is worth what he costs : " Our overhead is tremendous . Taxes , rents . My phone bill is $3000 a month . The amount of work that goes into a case is tremendous . " Yet he would never say how much he does cost . " It ' s difficult to say . The firm has all kinds of rates . It depends on the attorney ' s age , experience , the nature of the case . " Listening to Esdaile ' s vigorous presentation , it was easy to see how a jury might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft and comrades was evident . If he did not concede that there is any problem with the legal profession worthy of notice , his defense had the ready eloquence one acquires with a familiar topic . I was curious about his criteria for accepting a case . He mentioned three . " The first is the prospect for recovery . The second is the financial responsibility of the client . " Finally , " We would want to know , Is the case decent ? Does it have merit ? We ' ll never take a case where we suspect the court would be used to conduct a vendetta . " If some lawyers struggle with the two-master dilemma and some don ' t , Newton Esdaile seems to be one of the latter . I asked about his experience with it . Had he ever taken a case in which the chances of recovery were good , in which the client was financially responsible , but which he was not convinced was decent or meritorious ? " I know what you ' re getting at , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hell is paved with good intentions . With every case we take , ( he always says " We , " never " I " * , the merits get weighed as work progresses . We try very hard to make sure we ' re right , but as time passes , the opponent may read a statement from witnesses that may reveal flaws . We may tell the client , Hey look , we want to withdraw , our investigation indicates we can ' t see it your way . ' " In his brief for the general agreeableness of lawyers , Esdaile stressed their willingness to help one another ; he himself is noted for giving free advice . Of course , this works both ways : A lawyer will seek the aid of another . At one point , he whipped out a copy of a trial lawyers ' newsletter , flipped to that week ' s notable decisions , and put his finger on one judgment , a case in California in which a plaintiff was awarded $850,000 for the loss of a leg . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one legoff ( sic* , " he marveled . " Now , we would see an entry like this , then we get out this directory ( opening a fat book and taking the tone of a plumber explaining how to use a copper pipe cutter* and we look up the lawyer in the case . Then we would call him up and ask him to tell us all about it . " Presumably one would not be concerned in this instance with the questions of whether the case was decent and meritorious , the decision just , or the award fair . The point of interest at this point is not the search for justice , it is professional : winning.PAUL BROUNTAS The essential principles of tort law - Newton Esdaile ' s world - have links to William the Conqueror . But the corporate law of Paul Brountas is closer to Star Wars . Brountas , chairman of the corporate division of Boston ' s Hale &; Dorr , represents more than a dozen high technology firms , including Bytex , Prime Computer , Storage Technology Corporation , Computervision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetic engineering firms such as Genetics Institute . Brountas is affable and has a Fritz Mondale bounce about him . He is attentive , quick , articulate , and perhaps a bit eccentric . On one recent morning , he wore a conservative suit and a pair of Kelly green suspenders . He is from Bangor , Maine . After graduating from Bowdoin College , he went to Corpus Christi College at Oxford University , and Harvard Law School . He has never worked anywhere but at Hale &; Dorr . Describing himself as a liberal Democrat " in general , " he served as an aide to Senator Edmund Muskie during the 1972 presidential nomination campaign and was chairman of former Governor Michael Dukakis ' campaign committee in 1974 . He expects to be increasingly active in Dukakis ' gubernatorial campaign next year . At one time Brountas thought of returning to Maine and running for political office - for perhaps governor , representative , or senator - but he became so involved with his legal career that the right time never came . Now he doubts he ' ll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law practice entails the formation of partnerships and corporations , mergers , acquisitions , divestitures , stock offerings , and all legal questions relating to disclosure , financing , and compensation . Brountas and the sixty lawyers under him are among the forty-two thousand corporate lawyers who together constitute the largest - and fastest-growing - division in the American Bar Association . Brountas ' hourly rate is $200 , among the highest in the profession. - A corporate lawyer ' s encounter with the two-master dilemma would make the Delphic Oracle feel faint . His role is ostensibly to advise his client of the requirements of business law . But , unlike a trial lawyer , his arguments and judgments are usually not tested in court . Indeed , if the lawyer does his job well , his advice will never be tested ; his mission is to avoid the test . This means , according to Dean Huber , that corporate lawyers create a private body of law . " If you buy a car from me , " says Huber , " we can create any contract we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was interested in the Conoco takeover , for example , it was not involved in the transaction . The law was developed by the parties . " A contract has the force of law in that its terms are legally binding . Because the corporate counsel interprets the law without oversight by a court , in a sense taking the place of judge and jury , he or she might appear more the servant of justice than of client . But not in practice . Brountas ' duty may be , from the Securities Exchange Commission ' s point of view , to ensure that , say , Analog Devices does nothing illegal . But from Analog ' s point of view , his job is to assist the profit-making enterprise . Just as the primitive chieftain would not go to war without consulting his astrologer , so a businessman in today ' s intricately regulated marketplace does not dare move a muscle without consulting his lawyer . And businessmen being what they are , a lawyer whose response is limited to " You can ' t do that ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell him how he can do something - within the law , of course . And the waters the lawyer must navigate are often uncharted . As an example , Brountas cited the recent $50 million agreement between the Massachusetts General Hospital and Hoechst AG , the German pharmaceutical giant , for the financing of a new research department in genetic engineering . Though the MGH has kept the details of their agreement secret , the hospital has said that Hoechst will enjoy an exclusive license to market the patentable products that come out of the research and will benefit from direct participation in the research efforts . At the same time , the MGH scientists and researchers are said to be free to publish their works and collaborate with their peers as long as the company is kept informed . Ordinarily , Brountas explained , when a corporation hires a scientist or engineer to work on a project , a contract is drawn up whereby the researcher promises to keep the research secret . " But secrecy is anathema in the academic world . Publication is the lifeblood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to devise ways for the corporation to realize the fruits of the research it has paid for . " The corporate lawyer must develop an intimate knowledge of corporate structure and practice . " An effective corporate lawyer , " says Huber , " knows a business as well as the people who operate it . He participates in the financing , in the issuance of stock , the techniques of compensation . The great corporate lawyer has the knowledge , if not necessarily the temperament , to manage the corporation . " Specialized knowledge in the area of new ventures , so important to the young high technology industry , is the keystone of Paul Brountas ' reputation . Jesse Aweida , who built the billion-dollar Storage Technology Corporation ( STC ) of Colorado from nothing in the last twelve years , says of Brountas , " I ' ve always been impressed with his knowledge of issues facing a start-up company . If you ask him a question , you don ' t have to wait for him to do research ; in most cases he knows the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can take him into a negotiation and he ' ll support you with good , creative ideas . " The two-master dilemma hits the business lawyer hardest in the area of confidentiality , the subject of a white-hot debate in the profession . The ancient principle of attorney-client privilege preserves the lawyer from any obligation to divulge information provided by his client in confidence . For the trial lawyer , this privilege is as firm as the seal of confession . One Boston criminal lawyer , John Wall , says with fierce conviction , " My hero is the lawyer who refused to divulge the whereabouts of several bodies his client had buried . " For the business lawyer , it isn ' t so simple . What if he or she learns that the management of a client corporation intends to take an action that the lawyer has advised against and knows to be illegal ? If the corporate entity is the client , is the lawyer allowed or required to blow the whistle on the misdeeds of individuals ? Huber says , " In a technical sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular people in it with whom he deals . But in the ordinary course , he deals with the managers , the board of directors , or , remotely , the stockholders. " - An ABA commission has been wrestling with this question for four years , and its recommendation to last summer ' s convention drew such opposition that a decision is unlikely to be taken before next summer . The commission says that yes , in certain situations the lawyer should blow the whistle if both the management and the directors remain obdurate in rejecting his advice . In practice , says Paul Brountas , such a rule puts the lawyer in a difficult spot . The corporation may be his client , but he has to deal with flesh-and-blood people . What is likely to happen , if the whistle-blowing rule is accepted , is that a management will not discuss its plans with its attorneybecause it will feel it can not trust him . " That ' s the danger , " Brountas says . " I continually handle difficult situations where the client does take my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he doesn ' t trust me enough to discuss it with me . " This indeed was the reason for lawyer-client privilege in the beginning . On the principle that a defendant is entitled to the best possible defense , it was seen that he could have no defense if he did not level with his lawyer , and that he would not level with him if he did not trust him . The difficulty lies in trying to apply such a principle to the corporate situation , where the lawyer is supposed to be policeman , judge , and jury as well as counsel . The two-master hook par excellence . The potential for this conflict is great in the area of disclosure . Though SEC rules require that a corporation " promptly " disclose all information material to an investor ' s judgment , the means and timing of the disclosure can have serious effects . If a corporation suspects it is about to have a bad quarter , for example , how and when should this information be disclosed , when the well- being of the stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? The corporation turns in part to judge and jury - its lawyer - for advice on this point . Even assuming his advice is not disregarded , how does the lawyer , with his duty to his client and his duty to the law , sort it out ? Brountas ' answer has an echo of the chieftain ' s astrologer : " Often , " he says , " it ' s more a matter of lore than of law . " JOHN WALL Mark Coven talks about the close relationship between passion and performance and wonders how some lawyers can argue both sides of an issue . John Wall represents this issue with special poignance : He is one of a growing number of formerly feared prosecutors who have jumped the fence to the greener pastures of private practice . John Wall prosecuted Benjamin Spock and the Boston Five ( not the bank ) in the notorious 1968 draft-resistance conspiracy trial . Jessica Mitford , who covered the trial for the Atlantic , wrote that a spectator at one point whispered to another , " How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Torquemada ? " Whichever , they convicted the five , but the verdict was later thrown out because the judge improperly instructed the jury . Mitford described Wall ' s " retrousse nose , pale belligerent eyes under which bags are just beginning to form , a soft , embryonic jowl . " Thirteen years later , at 49 , the bags are well in place , but still Wall seems boyish , earnest . He stares straight at you almost every moment , as if you had just said something astonishing . His voice is large , formidable , if not loud , and his delivery has a hammering cadence . His profanity is conventional and seemingly deliberate ; he says " God-damned " - two distinct syllables - never " goddamn . " Wall had an active career as a prosecutor . He served in the US Department of Justice from 1963 until 1969 , then again from 1970 to 1973 , in positions including special trial assistant to the US attorney for the District of Columbia , assistant US Attorney for Massachusetts , and attorney in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( when he unsuccessfully prosecuted district attorney Jim Garrison , famous for his Kennedy conspiracy investigations ) . In 1969 and 1970 he was chief of the criminal division of the Massachusetts Attorney General ' s office . After his service in Massachusetts , Wall was brought back to Washington under John Mitchell and asked to investigate , and stand by to prosecute , the Chicago Eight and the Black Panthers on conspiracy charges . Persuaded that the government had no case , he argued against prosecution . " Those people ( the Chicago Eight* went to Chicago to peaceably assemble , " he recalls . " Daley ' s cops acted like God-damned stormtroopers , and when these people reacted , they broke some state statutes . But to prove a conspiracy , we would have had to argue that they crossed state lines with the intent to do that . " It was the same with the Black Panthers : All the government had was a lot of conversation and a few untrustworthy , bought witnesses . I said I wouldn ' t do it . I ' d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he believed to be politically motivated prosecutorial decisions , he did quit , in 1973 , and set up a private practice in Boston . Associated now with Albert Cullen , he has defended clients across the country in rape , murder , drug- running , racketeering , arson , fraud , political corruption , and bribery cases . He has also done civil litigation . As a prosecutor , Wall had a reputation for thoroughness , concentration , and determination , and he is said to approach a defense the same way . " He ' s a gunfighter , he psychs himself up before a trial , " says a lawyer who has watched him on both sides . As a defense lawyer , " He ' s just as passionate , just as sure he ' s right . " Fred Riley , chief investigator in the criminal bureau of the state attorney general ' s office , says , " He ' s dogged and thorough . He ' ll find out everything a prosecutor has through every legal means available . " Laymen imagine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least that they should , and so for Wall to switch sides with apparently undiminished zeal might seem peculiar . Walter Shapiro , writing in the July 26 Washington Post magazine , likened the prevalent trend of prosecutors switching sides to " seeing a doctor go from prescribing penicillin to rooting for the germs . " Wall has obviously thought a lot about this , and his explanation has two themes . First , he did not change - his superiors did . " I always got a great deal of satisfaction out of doing a difficult job well , but by the time Nixon and his crew got in , it was impossible to do that . The first five years I was at Justice , it was the proudest place in Washington . By the time I quit , I was almost ashamed to admit I worked there . " Second , defending is not really so different from prosecuting , and so in Wall ' s case at least the shift was not so startling . Prosecution is a high calling because " it is a prosecutor ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high calling , too , because " you ' re defending all rights when you defend your client ' s rights . " Therefore , for a lawyer who is sworn to uphold justice to defend a person whom he personally believes to be guilty is not , as Wall sees it , to mount the horns of the two-master dilemma . The client is merely the vehicle by which the defense lawyer serves the good of all . Wall didn ' t say so , but another benefit of switching sides is that private practice is more profitable . Again , lawyers are uncomfortable about talking about money , perhaps because they fear it gives their high calling a certain mercenary echo . If Esdaile ' s defense was to argue that his labor makes him worthy of his hire , Wall ' s is to call attention to his charitable work : " When I responded to your question the other day , " he wrote in a lettersent after the interview , " that I charge between $125 and $150 an hour , I should have mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pro bono ' work ( from the Latin pro bono publico , for the good of the community which of course pays very little money or even no money at all . " Ego is clearly an important ingredient in Wall ' s " zeal and passion " - words he uses to describe himself . His resume describes in gratuitous detail his military career , in which he rose from private to first lieutenant in three years , qualifying as a ranger and paratrooper ( he is a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve ) . " I frankly love to win , " he wrote , " and I also love the contest for its own sake , win or lose . Part of the satisfaction of being a trial lawyer is that it is one of the last frontiers of the individualist. " - Despite his devotion to the law and legal procedure , John Wall has a peculiar cynicism about the possibilities for real justice . " One thing I always tell my clients , " he says , " is that there ' s no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and losers . The ideals of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights are always there , and we strive for them , but you have to fight like hell . When justice does happen , its almost an accident . " That Wall does get impassioned about legal principles , regardless of the personalities involved , is clear . A good example is the Turkette case . Novia Turkette of Peabody was convicted in 1979 of infiltrating several criminal enterprises under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations ( RICO ) statute . The conviction was reversed in federal appeals court , but the government appealed the reversal to the US Supreme Court . Wall argued unsuccessfully there that the RICO statute applied only to infiltration of legitimate businesses , not criminal enterprises , and that Turkette was therefore improperly prosecuted . Though he lost the case , Wall says , " There is great excitement in participating in the development of the law at its very frontiers . " He quotes Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter : " ( T*he history of liberty has largely been the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wall said , " The fact is , our most fundamental liberties have been vindicated and sustained in the defense of the rights of some not very nice people . " Wall expresses alarm over what he sees as erosion of the protections of the accused . " The Fifth Amendment is being eroded ; the polls show a majority of people in this country think the Bill of Rights is a God-damned commie plot . In England they ' ve already taken away the jury trial in civil cases , and that Anglophile at the head of the Supreme Court here would love to get rid of the jury in this country . " One can understand the wrath that Wall , the stickler for procedure , feels for Chief Justice Warren Burger . Burger may have had in mind the Turkette case and others like it when he railed in a recent speech against appeals and reversals based on " technicalities " that work to the advantage of criminals . Wall says , " He ' s not fed up with technicalities ; he ' s fed up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheriff of Nottingham ? " Still , a passion for proper procedure does not entirely efface curiosity over a lawyer ' s ability to subsume his personal sympathies . After all , where does that ability leave a lawyer in the case of a bad procedure or a bad law ? A conversation between Jessica Mitford and John Wall during the Spock trial raises this point , if only indirectly . Mitford was questioning the " vast potential scope " of the conspiracy statute under which the Boston Five were tried . " So , I asked , " wrote Mitford , " the man who cheers and claps like mad after Dr. Spock has spoken is a co-conspirator , but the man who sits glum , whose face betrays disapproval of Dr. Spock ' s remarks , is not ? That is substantially correct , answered Mr. Wall . " Wall describes himself as a liberal Democrat who opposed the Vietnam war , and he bridles when he remembers how " everybody assumed I was some sort of Nazi " during the Spock period . Fred Riley says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s 99 percent sincerity . It ' s easier for him to get emotional because he believes in what he ' s doing , and believing it , he ' s able to psych himself . " One recalls that Wall ' s objection to the Chicago Seven and Black Panther trials was that the government had no case , and one wonders at what level Riley ' s word " believe " operates . Did Wall believe in what he was doing when he prosecuted both the Boston Five and the two Jehovah ' s Witnesses in the sixties who were convicted and jailed for refusing military service and alternative service ? His answer had a certain seesaw quality . " The Jehovah ' s Witnesses were sincere , patriotic young people doing the right thing according to theirlights . They ended up going to jail , and I felt terrible about it . I thought Dr. Spock was one of the great patriots of history . ( Indeed , he said as much in his summation. * But it was my job . It was like the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , you can also say , Somebody has to clean the sewers , but it doesn ' t have to be me . ' " I don ' t know if I would prosecute Dr. Spock today . I almost certainly would not prosecute the Jehovah ' s Witnesses . To some extent you sell yourself a bill of goods on both sides . There ' s a lot of gray - I see a lot more gray as a defense lawyer . " In his follow-up letter , there was none of this agony ( Wall is said to be an ace at written argument ) : " Protesters such as Dr. Spock , Jehovah ' s Witnesses , and others who were willing to challenge what they considered to be unjust laws and who were willing to pay the price if convicted of violating the law have impressed me deeply . My radicalization was completed , however . . . by the Nixon administration in the early ' 70s and the government conduct in Watergate and other matters . " Here is Wall on the heaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not his natural element . Framed on the wall of his personal law library is a dialogue between Sir Thomas More and his son-in-law from Robert Bolt ' s play , A Man for All Seasons : " Roper : Then you set man ' s law above God ' s ! " More : No , far below ; but let me draw your attention to a fact - I ' m not God . The currents and eddies of right and wrong , which you find such plain sailing , I can ' t navigate . . . . But in the thickets of the law , oh , there I ' m a forester . I doubt if there ' s a man alive who could follow me there , thank God . " Wall clearly regards this as a model to be followed , but remembering More ' s Utopia , a state governed entirely by reason from which lawyers were banned for " disguising matters , " one suspects it could be interpreted more than one way . - The legal profession is thriving . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every 400 people , and the total grows by as many as 40,000 annually . The population of Massachusetts increased 1 percent in the decade of the seventies , while the number of practicing lawyers increased 57 percent . Harvard Law School has 7000 applications for 750 spaces this year . BostonCollege Law School has 5100 applicants for 250 spaces , Suffolk 3500 for 500 spaces , and Boston University about 5000 for 375 spaces . There are many lawyers , but there is room for many more . Boston College Law School reports that 275 law firms , corporations , and public agencies recuited on campus last year , and 97 percent of its graduates each year find jobs within nine months of graduation . The average starting salary at Boston ' s large law firms is $30,000 . Yes , lawyers are doing fine by every visible measure . But they can never escape fully the distrust of their motives , of their " beliefs . " No matter how great the lawyer , that germ of distrust can never be erased . Thomas More , after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him his head .
