The U.S. and France fail to stop a Libyan advance <P> Rising as suddenly as a Sahara sandstorm , the little war in the Central African nation of Chad turned increasingly ominous and ugly last week . With the help of intensive Libyan bombing raids , rebel forces seized the northern town of Faya-Largeau ( pop . 7,000 ) . In the process , they reduced much of the mud-and-brick oasis to rubble . As many as one-third of the Chadian government 's 3,000 soldiers were reported to be dead , wounded or captured , and hundreds more were stranded in the north . Others , retreating before what the government called " murderous nonstop " Libyan air strikes , proceeded to set up a new defense line some 200 miles to the south . <P> In an effort to check Libyan Leader Muammar Gaddafi 's expansionist aims , President Reagan had dispatched $25 million worth of military aid , two AWACS electronic surveillance planes , eight F-15 fighter escorts and a reconnaissance plane to the area . After some hesitation , French PresidentFranois Mitterrand agreed last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " advisers . " But given the size of the Libyan commitment , which included 2,500 ground troops and impressive airpower , the limited U.S. and French assistance failed to turn the tide . In a press conference after the fall of Faya-Largeau , Reagan indicated that the Administration would not be sending further help for the time being . He noted that the U.S. could not play the role of " world policeman , " and urged France to take the lead in Chad . " It is not our primary sphere of influence , " the President said . " It is that of France . " <P> Chadian President Hissene Habr , too , looked to France for aid , particularly air support to offset the dominance of Libyan aircraft over northern Chad . Said Information Minister Soumalia Mahamat : " French airpower is indispensable against Libyan airpower . " He also appealed for the use of French combat forces . " If French troops are here merely as instructors , " he argued , " it does n't matter whether there are 1,000 or 100,000 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Libyan and rebel forces on Faya-Largeau were fleeing across the desert toward the eastern town of Abch and the capital city of N'Djamena , 400 miles to the southwest . Evidence of the scale and intensity of the Libyan air raids could be seen in N'Djamena 's public hospital , to which some 140 soldiers had been brought . They had been flown out of Faya-Largeau at night when government forces could still use the town 's unpaved airstrip . Evacuation of the injured ended abruptly when Libyan bombing raids put the airstrip out of action . After that , the wounded died amid the ruins of the town that , in the seesaw fighting for control of the north , they had actually recaptured from their enemies only ten days earlier .
