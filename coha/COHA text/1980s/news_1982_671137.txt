The Commerce Department placed Creusot-Loire of Paris , recently nationalized by the French Government , and Dresser France , the wholly owned subsidiary of Dresser Industries of Dallas , on what the department called a " temporary denial " list. // The order raises to a new level of intensity a bitter dispute between the Reagan Administration and Western European governments over the advisability both of helping the Soviet Union build the 3 , 600-mile pipeline and buying the natural gas it would transport from Siberia to Western Europe. // The action was announced only 35 minutes after the Commerce Department received word that three compressors built by Dresser France for Creusot-Loire , one of the prime contractors for the Soviet pipeline , had left on a French vessel from Le Havre bound for the Soviet Union through Riga , Latvia . ( Page D1. ) // Lionel H. Olmer , Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade Administration , said the companies were barred from buying all goods and services from the United States . The order does not affect sales to the United States. // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Olmer did not specify the duration of the order , but it is understood to be for 30 days , after which it could be renewed . <> <> Enforcement by Customs // Mr. Olmer said the denial orders , which he termed a " measured response " to violations of American export controls imposed last June , would be enforced by Customs Service officials , who have been instructed to watch bills of lading and stop any goods destined for the two companies. // The President acted against the pipeline in executive orders last December , which were tightened in June after the crackdown in Poland . The June 18 ruling extended a ban on American oil and gas equipment for the pipeline both to the foreign operations of United States companies and to foreign companies that use American technology under li- <> cense in their own manufacturing . Dresser officials , noting that their French subsidiary shipped the compressors under an order and threat of criminal and civil penalties from the French Government , have maintained that they are caught unwittingly in the middle of a power play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the United States. // John V. James , chairman of the parent company , has told reporters in Dallas that the results could be to cause Dresser to shift production - and jobs - out of this country to its foreign plants. // Edward R. Luter , Dresser ' s senior vice president , when asked about the President ' s decision , said in a television interview , " I don ' t agree with his action , but everyone ' s entitled to mistakes. " // Dresser lawyers lost a bid in Federal court Tuesday to block the United States Government from imposing sanctions against the company . John L. Ellicott , of the Washington law firm of Covington &; Burling , which represents Dresser , said no decision had been taken on whether to pursue further challenges . <> Manufacturers Criti- cal // Jerry Jasinowski , senior vice president and chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers , also criticized today ' s action . He commented , " It makes little sense for the U.S. Government to penalize a foreign subsidiary of an American company for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is incorporated and operates. " // Creusot-Loire , which has about a dozen subsidiaries in the United States , is one of the main European turbine-builders for the pipeline. // Others include Britain ' s John Brown P.L.C. , West Germany ' s AEG-Telefunken ( which has said it would honor its contracts with the Soviets even though it has just filed for receivership ) , France ' s Alsthom-Atlantique and Italy ' s Nuovo Pignone . They all produce turbines or compressors , using American technology . All the European governments are either ordering or encouraging their manufacturers to fulfill the pipeline con- <> <> Other Violators // Today ' s actions were the first to enforce the pipeline controls under the Export Administration Act and Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige served notice in a prepared statement that penalties would be meted out to any other violators. // However , officials who asked not to be identified reported that the sanctions announced today were in fact milder than some that had been considered . The officials said that extradition and imprisonment of officers of companies violating the sanctions had been discussed. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said one Administration official , " but we are hoping that the situation can be defused , possibly by a high level diplomatic mission that can work out some negotiated settlement . " He suggested a pact that might involve lifting the sanctions in return for stiffer European controls over credits to the Soviet Union . <> <> Conflict with International Law // The European governments have strongly protested the American controls as violations of international law . Asked at a press conference today whether he believed the American controls were consistent with interntional law , Sherman E. Unger , general counsel for the Commerce Department , said : " The Congress of the United States is not bound by international law when it passes a statute . It is our responsibility to enforce that statute. " // He added that if there was a question about whether he would enforce French or United States laws , " I assure you I will enforce our laws.

The Carter Administration banned the import of certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company undercut sanctions imposed against the Soviets for their intervention in Afghanistan by agreeing to build a $350 million electric steel plant for the Soviet Union . An American company , Armco Inc. , gave up the contract to comply with the Carter sanctions. // Creusot-Loire officials denied that they were acting against the sanctions . The Reagan Administration lifted the ban against the French company as one of its early acts in office. //
