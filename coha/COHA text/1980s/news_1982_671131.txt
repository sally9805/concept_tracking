Those are the latest offerings of Izod/Lacoste , the General Mills subsidiary that owns the popular alligator trademark , and if the alligators are diminutive , there is nothing small about the price tags . Nonetheless , shipments to retailers have risen more than 25 percent this year , according to Herbert Rubensohn , president of the children ' s division. // While the clothing industry is suffering from the recession , the baby business is booming , according to apparel manufacturers , retailers and analysts . The primary reason , they say , is demographics . The number of births is rising , with a higher percentage to first-time mothers . Furthermore , more parents are older and affluent. // " Mothers these days are working women , and they really are indulging their children , " said Ruth Scharf , a long-established designer and manufacturer of higher-priced children ' s wear , who began a line of infants ' wear three years ago . <> <> Big Push in Small Sizes // The size of the baby boom is disputed . Because 1980 census data have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertility rate , measured in terms of numbers of births per 1 , 000 women , has actually risen . But according to the United States Census Bureau , the number of births , which fell to 3. 1 million in 1973 , has been rising steadily since , to 3. 66 million in 1981. // That still compares poorly with the previous boom , which peaked in 1957 with 4. 3 million births . However , while 27 percent of the births in 1957 were first births , 42 percent of today ' s newborns are first births. // Given the ambiguous figures , there is even some disagreement whether the nation is in the midst of a baby boom . " It depends on what you ' re selling , " said Martin O ' Connell , chief of the fertility statistics branch at the Census Bureau . " Demographers would say no , as the fertility rate doesn ' t seem to have steady upward momentum . But manufacturers of baby booties might say yes. " // Among the manufacturers is Levi Strauss &; Company . The nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a projected 17 percent increase in the number of 2- to 6-year-olds in the next five years. // " We ' re putting more emphasis on the smaller sizes over the next five to ten years , as it ' s one of the areas that offers good demographics , " said Peter Jacobi , president of the youthwear division . This autumn , the division is introducing a line for little girls aged 3 to 6 . <> <> Hotly Contested Market // The children ' s wear market was only $14. 2 billion last year , according to Chain Store Age magazine , but that relatively small market is bitterly contested . In addition to the jeans giants such as Levi Strauss and Blue Bell , there are a handful of publicly held companies , devoted to children ' s wear , with sales over $100 million : the William Carter Company , Garan Inc . , Health-tex Inc. ( the Chesebrough-Pond ' s subsidiary ) and BTK Industries ( formerly Billy the Kid ) . // Not all children ' s wear manufacturers are thriving . Sales are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s wear makers . Leo Feuer , Carter ' s chief executive officer , said that the stores , to keep their inventories low , were refraining from buying even such basics as underwear. // However , most of the children ' s wear makers have outperformed general apparel companies in recent years , according to Robert Nahas of Kurt Salmon Associates , the management consulting firm specializing in the apparel and textile industries. // The reason is not only demographics . " These companies are doing right things in building their position in the market , advertising and emphasizing quality , " Mr. Nahas said. // Among those is Health-tex , the largest manufacturer of branded merchandise for children , from newborns to 12-year-olds , that is sold in department and specialty stores . Health-tex ' s sales , which rose 23. 5 percent last year , to $251 million , have risen by about 21 percent so far this year , and " infants ' wear is growing faster than the average , " said Robert Breakstone , president . Last spring , the company brought out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Showers // At Sears , Roebuck &; Company , the nation ' s largest retailer , total apparel sales had single-digit growth in the first half of this year , but sales of clothing for newborns to 5-year-olds grew by doubledigit figures , according to the company. // Furthermore , sales of newborns ' clothing - more than half of which is purchased as gifts - grew faster than sales of clothing for children from 6 months to 2 years , Sears reported . One reason , suggested Ernst Kaufman , a senior buyer for the Sears Baby Shop , " is that people are having more showers " and other events to celebrate the arrival of a first baby. // As the popularity of the pint-sized Izods suggests , higher-priced children ' s wear , like better apparel for adults , has resisted the recession . Miss Scharf , for example , finds that one of her bestselling designs is a " Woodsman " line that features olive-green pants , quilted vests ( with suede gun patch ) and bibs ( with duck applique ) for infants , at $10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will pay those prices to clothe a 6-month-old ? " I used to be , " she said , " but not anymore. " // While the girls ' dress business has been hurt by the jeans craze , Miss Scharf said , the smaller sizes are selling nicely , and the infants ' wear category is growing fastest of all . " If we had cut double the amount , we ' d sell it , " she said . " We haven ' t even scratched the surface. " //
