44 the sword from El Cid hangs on a wall . We would n't know . Nor can we confirm that , for two years after the Hestons moved in , it was impossible to avoid the Ben-Hur sound track piped through ten miles of wiring to every point in the house and grounds , including the steam room . One of Heston 's friends , after looking down at Los Angeles from the Hestons ' vantage point , is said to have observed , " It 's a hell of a place to pour boiling oil on them from . " We got no farther than the wall of old prints and meticulous penand-ink sketches by our host than he ushered us down the hall , out the door , past a carport shielding two sports cars from the California sun and into an adjoining glass-front building facing the tennis court . Is it on the court that the actor maintains the trim figure that belies his 60 years ? " Well , my Scotch-Protestant background tells me that anything that is fun is n't good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I do n't count tennis , although I do play a lot . How do I keep in shape ? Endless work . And I work out every morning . I jogged for an hour before you got here . " Then we were out on a wind-swept boardwalk leading to still another structure . While Heston returned to the main house to find the right key , we looked out across the unpopulated valley . The Hestons need not be concerned that the neighborhood will go to pot . Their house is the neighborhood . // " We are surrounded by 800 acres of water-development property , " Heston said upon his return . He opened the door to a room whose ambience smacks of relaxation , hobby and stolen hours of togetherness . Heston gestured toward the well-lighted lower level of the split-level structure : " That 's my wife 's studio down there . " A glance around the more somber , somewhat cluttered upper section and he added , " We can talk down there . " Looking at Heston across the coffee table , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 207-pound frame with the many movers and shakers of history he has brought to life upon the stage or screen . What challenges the imagination is that the man who to us is John the Baptist , Andrew Jackson , BenHur , the Cid , Michelangelo , Thomas Jefferson and Moses actually grew up a shy little boy in the backwoods settlement of St. Helen , Michigan . September ' 84 We said that we had fished Lake St. Helen many times . " You have ? For gosh sake ! I have n't fished there in years . I own one of those lakes now . Russell Lake . It was one of the first things I bought with my movie money . But I do n't get up there much . " I lived there until I was ten . This was all a rustic community then . We did n't have a church . And our school was only one room , " he said . How many children ? " Thirteen pupils in eight grades , three of whom were my cousins . I was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water ? " No indoor water . There was a pump in the front yard . I remember I had one of those folding aluminum cups , a telescopic cup . I 'm not certain everybody did that , but I had one . " And did he skip some grades by being able to listen to the older kids ? " 1 did n't skip any grades , " Heston said . " But in retrospect , I do think there were two things that were valuable about that experience . On the one hand you could say it was very depriving to be in such a primitive educational environment . On the other hand , there were no distractions . In my case , I had 1/13 of the teacher 's time . There are few schools where you get that . The teacher , of course , was a man . He had to chop wood for the stove and carry out the ashes , and there was a lot of snow to be shoveled . I remember two different teachers in the time I was there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that school experience  --  the class seldom had  --  more than two students , three at most . Say , sixth-grade geography would go sit on the bench in front . The whole building , you know , was n't much bigger than this room . About this big , 1 guess . And the rest of us sat at our desks . So if I was n't drawing cowboys in my geography book , I listened to what they were talking about . I guess some of it just rubbed off . " Did the drawing of cowboys mean that there were daydreams even then about a character outside the real-life role of the nine-year-old Charlton Heston ? " Well , I had almost no playmates , " Heston said . " Of course , there was no television then . There were movies , but the nearest movie was 25 miles away . I remember going to it , but it was not something I did frequently . That was a very special experience . And there was certainly no theater . I remember going to the theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit my grandmother at Christmas , but that was very rare . " There were books , hunting and fishing and pretend games . When you are nine years old and you are hunting rabbits and you are not seeing any rabbits , it really becomes more interesting to be hunting Blackfeet instead . And Davy Crockett is a more attractive personality than a little nine-year-old boy with his nose running . All kids play pretend games . Or they used to . I imagine they just sit and watch TV now . Children are instinctive actors . And because of the isolated nature of my boyhood , I went on doing it longer than most kids . Which , in a sense , was compounded when we moved to an affluent , very sophisticated city suburb like Winnetka Illinois . " I mean , it compounded my shyness . Because when I went to high school , I was certainly not equipped for it socially . Not even physically , especially in sports terms . I went out for football when I got big enough , but that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it and 1 was n't particularly good at it . The rifle team I could make , because I knew about shooting . And the theater and the acting were there , where I could pretend to be other people ; and I had a marvelous time . " So marvelous , in fact , that work in the community theater led to a scholarship to Northwestern University , which has one of the country 's better acting schools , one that would have been well beyond the reach of one of its most illustrious alumni without financial help . Here , in a particularly fertile period for the school , he came under the tutelage of an outstanding acting teacher and found himself in the company of such promising talents as Patricia Neal and Tony Randall . Those early years of isolation , are they all behind him now ? " You could say that they are one of the reasons why I play so many biographical parts and , in effect , character parts where I put on false noses and rubber wrinkles and wear wigs and stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide behind his characters ? " That is not as uncommon as one might think , " he said . " That is why a lot of actors act . At least that is why I act . " Before going on , Heston picked up the phone and asked for coffee . He told us he ca n't make plays or movies without it  --  it 's the lifeblood of those undertakings . This observation led to the question of smoking . He does n't smoke , yet he claims no virtue as a mice and rats . ing to have a career in gallery or museum work . Heston 's nightlife is also curtailed by his intensive work habits . Not satisfied with learning the lines and playing the role , he must immerse himself in the character he is to play until he and the historical image of that character become one . Upon seeing his performance in the screen adaptation of Irving Stone 's The Agony and the Ecstasy , Stone reflected , " He literally becomes Michelangelo . " " Dedication in preparing for a role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biographical roles , of which I have probably played more than most actors , require more research . Roles with specific physical competence require a lot of preparation . My roles as a conductor and a pro quarterback required as much physical preparation as any parts I have done . " And , yes , it is true that before beginning The Agony and the Ecstasy he read 600 letters ( the total that had been translated ) written by Michelangelo , traveled to study as many of his works as possible and spent hours contemplating the artist 's character . For the role of Moses in the classic The Ten Commandments he walked barefoot in costume across the broiling , jagged rocks at the foot of Mt . Sinai , memorized whole slabs of the Old Testament , studied the works of Biblical scholars and pondered the meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls . Your present play , Detective Story , is it just between films ? we asked . " I do n't call it just , " was his quick reply . " I do a play every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life , and my life is my work . " Having played Moses and John the Baptist , are you a religious man ? " My religion is one of the private areas I have , " was his quick response . " It is personal and , obviously , like everything else in my life , it has been shaped by my life . I think it would be pompous of me to say I played Moses and found God . However , playing the two religious characters I have done , John the Baptist and Moses , two pretty good characters , has definitely marked my life . So has Richelieu ; so has playing McCloud in Detective Story  --  that is a moral experience , if you will . Yes , it would be fair to say that the experience of exploring these great guys has been a
