The writer is president of Yankelovich , Skelly &; White Inc. , the New York-based public opinion research firm that since 1972 has conducted polls on various subjects for this magazine . <P> <P> In the 1976 presidential election , the catch phrase was " voter apathy . " Journalists and politicians cited the public opinion polls to " prove " a mass defection from the electoral process . But while millions of voters stayed away from the voting booths , apathy was not the phenomenon at all . Voters were angry , frustrated and irritated at what they felt was the futility of their participation in elections . Something was in the air , but it was not voter indifference . <P> This year the catch phrase is " volatile . " First the public favors an unannounced Kennedy candidacy 2 to 1 over President Carter 's ; months later that has changed to Carter 2 to 1 over Kennedy . Then , in New York and Connecticut , Kennedy beats Carter . The President 's management of the American hostage situation in Iran was at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a minus . Once again the public opinion polls are cited , and " volatility " is said to be the explanation . But once again the catch phrase is misleading . <P> Certainly there have been wide swings in public opinion in this 1980 presidential campaign . And just as certainly there will be more swings . But volatile , according to the dictionary , describes one who is " lighthearted , " " fickle " or " capricious " and whose views are " transitory or fleeting . " Applied to the current mood of the American public , these terms are laughably inaccurate . One can describe the American electorate in 1980 as troubled or conflict-ridden or agitated about what many regard as the unsatisfactory choices that confront them . But this is hardly a fickle or transitory state of mind . And it certainly is not lighthearted . <P> In 1944 Sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld demonstrated in his studies of voting behavior that conflict breeds delay in a voter 's making up his or her mind . What we are witnessing now in the ups and downs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict . Its presence means that many voters are going to wait until the last minute to decide . Every electoral race in this campaign , from the primaries to the main bout , is likely to be a cliffhanger , with the opinion polls unable to predict the outcome much in advance of the event . <P> Ordinarily the public is neither as conflict-ridden nor as relentlessly bombarded with daily polls as we are now . Though the contemporary scene makes for confusion and instability , there is one consolation . The confusion presents a unique opportunity to gain an insight indispensable to all who rely upon poll data . It highlights a missing element in the relationship of opinion polls to the public whose views they register .
