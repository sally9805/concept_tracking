More than 2,500 people are killed in the worst industrial disaster ever <P> The first sign that something was wrong came at 11 p.m . A worker at the Union Carbide pesticide plant on the outskirts of Bhopal ( pop . 672,000 ) , an industrial city 466 miles south of New Delhi , noticed that pressure was building up in a tank containing 45 tons of methyl isocyanate , a deadly chemical used to make pesticides . At 56 minutes past midnight , the substance began escaping into the air from a faulty valve . For almost an hour , the gas formed a vast , dense fog of death that drifted toward Bhopal . <P> The vapor passed first over the shantytowns of Jaiprakash and Chhola , just outside the walls of the plant , leaving hundreds dead as they slept . The gas quickly enveloped the city 's railway station , where beggars were huddled against the chill . In minutes , a score had died and 200 others were gravely ill . Through temples and shops , over streets and lakes , across a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spread , noiselessly and lethally . The night air was fairly cool ( about 60 F ) , the wind was almost calm , and a heavy mist clung to the earth ; those conditions prevented the gas from dissipating , as it would have done during the day . <P> A few hundred yards from the chemical plant , M.A. Khan , a farmer , was lying in bed when he heard several thumps at a nearby dairy farm and sensed that his own cows were milling about restlessly . He arose and went outside . Two cows were dead on the ground . A third gave out a loud groan and collapsed as Khan watched . Then the farmer 's eyes began to smart painfully . He ran into the darkness . The day after , at Bhopal 's Hamidia Hospital , his eyes shut tightly and tears streaming down his cheeks , Khan described his fear : " I thought it was a plague . " <P> Others thought it was a nuclear bomb or an earthquake or the end of the world . As word of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then thousands , took to the road in flight from the fumes . In cars and rickshaws , on foot and bicycles , residents moved as fast as they could . As in some eerie science-fiction nightmare , hundreds of people blinded by the gas groped vainly toward uncontaminated air or stumbled into one another in the darkness . Others simply collapsed by the side of the road in the crush . At least 37 people who had inhaled the fumes died hours later from the effects , having reached what they thought was safety .
