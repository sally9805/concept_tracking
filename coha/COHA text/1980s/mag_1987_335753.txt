The 1988 presidential race has come to resemble a marathon encounter session : long periods of tedium punctuated by embarrassing personal disclosures . The latest revelation came last week when Kitty Dukakis , 50 , the seemingly self- assured wife of Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis , publicly enrolled in the Betty Ford school of political candor . Her secret : 26 years of mild amphetamine dependency that ended in 1982 after she secretly entered a drug- rehabilitation clinic in Minnesota . <P> Were it not for Dukakis ' place at the front rank of Democratic presidential contenders , the story Mrs. Dukakis told at the dedication of a drug-treatment center in Norfolk , Mass. , would be sadly ordinary . Her problem began when , as a 19-year-old in 1956 , she obtained a prescription for diet pills to control her weight . ( At 5 ft. 6 in. , she then weighed about 130 lbs. ; she now weighs 120 lbs . ) Years of deceit followed as she began each morning with a small 5-mg dose of amphetamines . In hindsight , she concedes that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " false energy level . " <P> Discovery did not come until late 1974 , fully eleven years after she married Dukakis . Her husband , just elected Governor , stumbled on her cache of pills . " I told him the truth : I was dependent , " she recalls . Her family doctor tried to wean her from the diet pills , but three months later she was again covertly obtaining them from another physician . She continued the charade for eight more years until her husband noticed a stray bill from the doctor who was writing her prescription . Only then did Mrs. Dukakis reluctantly confront her dependency . " I had been taking diet pills for 26 years , " she says . " I was very frightened . I did n't know much about recovery programs . " <P> In the summer of 1982 , with Dukakis locked in a tight race for Governor , his wife invented a mythical case of hepatitis to mask her monthlong stay at the Hazelden Rehabilitation Center in Center City , Minn . Defending this cover- up at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very important to her that this not be public , and I respected that . " <P> Why then did Kitty Dukakis suddenly feel compelled to set the record straight five years later ? " I 've had a long enough period of recovery , " she explained . " I feel strongly about my recovery , and one of the tenets of recovery is to help other people . " There were no rumors about Kitty Dukakis and no apparent political need to go public . But a carefully timed announcement was probably inevitable after she revealed her diet-pill problem to Campaign Manager John Sasso in March . <P> Her bravery should not be minimized , nor should the extent of her former drug problem be exaggerated . Medical experts say the amount of amphetamines she was taking probably caused only psychological dependency . Dr. Jack Blaine , the chief of treatment research at the National Institute on Drug Abuse , says , " Giving this up is more than giving up one 's morning coffee and less than giving up cigarettes . " Kitty Dukakis might agree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
