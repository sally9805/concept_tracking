 | A robot revolution is sweeping Japan , strengthening the nation 's already potent industrial might and showing the way for factories in the United States and other countries to enter a science-fiction future . Here in Japan , about 75,000 robots ? or robotlike devices ? are at work , replacing humans in scores of plants . Within 20 years , some experts predict , these mechanical hands will take over from tens of thousands of workers in many of Japan 's most advanced manufacturing centers . The science of robotics is virtually in its infancy . But already robots here are performing such tasks as welding , painting , lifting , assembling and testing finished products . Some even sort out defective drugs and pills , remove foreign materials from powders and check to make sure that bottles are properly labeled and filled . Even more complicated roles are seen in years ahead . Scientists and engineers are developing robots that can see , feel , hear and obey verbal instructions . Someday , Japanese authorities say , they will handle cleaning and laundry in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aid in the care of handicapped persons . But even the most sophisticated robots now in use are a far cry from humanlike creatures pictured in " Star Wars " and other futuristic films . Machine or robot ? Most of what the Japanese call robots are mere mechanical arms that can perform simple repetitive jobs in a factory such as lifting objects and placing them elsewhere . In American terminology , these devices are not classified as robots but as automated machines . That is why American and Japanese experts differ on the number of robots in japan . By U.S. standards , true robots here would total about 14,000 , not 75,000 . U.S. industry currently has only about 5,000 in use , but it also is on the threshold of a robot explosion . Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan predicted on January 6 that by 1990 half the workers in U.S. factories will be specialists trained to service and repair robots . Whatever these mechanical devices are called , their performances are amazing . A robot can carry loads too heavy for a human , explore seabeds or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . What makes a robot different from an ordinary machine is its electronic brain ? a microcomputer that can be programed to do an assigned task repeatedly , at the same pace and accuracy . Once programed , a robot needs little or no human supervision . In the mid-1980s , it is expected that industrial robots even will be able to change their own parts . One of Japan 's leading producers of automated equipment is Fujitsu Fanac , Ltd . In its plant located at the foot of famed Mount Fuji , robots are used to make other robots . The plant opened in December , 1980 . President Seiuemon Inaba plans to triple monthly production to 350 units within three years During the day , 100 workers tend the machines that turn out robot components and numerical-control devices that direct the motions of a machine by use of punched or magnetic tapes . At night , the factory operates with only a control-room supervisor and a security guard on duty . Expanding role . Japanese auto manufacturers are making growing use of robots . Nissan Motor Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now has 460 on its painting and welding lines . At its passenger-car assembly plant near Tokyo , 50 robot , handle nearly 97 percent of the welding on hoods , fenders , doors and roofs . Toyota Motor Company has 405 welding robots and 15 doing forging . casting and pressing chores . Both companies plan eventually to use robots for all welding and painting operations . Robots are taking over many operations in Japan 's big electronics industry . At the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company 's television plant near Osaka , four robots run four production lines . They do 80 percent of the work of inserting into printed-circuit boards such tiny components as resistors , capacitors , diodes and integrated circuits . Robotization is not the monopoly of large corporations . In Tokyo , a small factory making plastic-toy components is run by just one man . His work force  | consists of three robots that operate plastic-injection molding machines . Ironically , it was the U.S. , not Japan , that pioneered the building of robots in the early 1960s . But it was Japan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in factories . Japanese now are far ahead of their American counterparts . Growth in U.S. , Europe . The use of robots is spreading , not only in America , but also in Europe . The 5,000 in the U.S. are used mainly in the automobile industry , and their number is expected to grow rapidly as companies push for increased productivity and lower costs . Although the Japanese have had the market much to themselves for the past decade , they realize that the U.S. soon could catch up . " Once the Americans decide to go ahead with robotization in earnest , they would easily overtake Japanese competition , " says Naohide Kumagai , an executive with Tokyo 's Kawasaki Heavy Industries . But for now , the U.S. is a prime market for Japanese-built machines . Masayoshi Yamaoka , robot-systems-division manager for Hitachi , Ltd. , says his company markets painting and welding units in the U.S. through Automatix , Inc. , of Burlington , Mass . In August , Hitachi signed a **26;499;TOOLONG agreement with General Electric under which GE will be licensed to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell Hitachi-brand products in the U.S. Other firms that have entered the U.S. market include Yasukawa Electric , Fujitsu Fanac and Dainichi Kiko Company . All three firms also sell in Europe . A combination of problems spurred the robot revolution in Japan . The 1973 oil crunch forced manufacturers to look for ways to counter the ballooning costs of energy . There was a worsening shortage of technical workers . And many blue-collar employes were demanding to be freed from monotonous , repetitious and often dangerous or unsanitary manual labor . Robots provide at least a partial answer to all of these problems . For instance , one robot can do the work of several humans . Says Akira Nagano , a spokesman for the Matsushita Company : " In our color-TV plant , five component-insertion robots , tended by four workers , can do the same amount A seabed robot , the first of its kind , aids in bridge construction by surveying bottom of the Inland Sea . The robots , which cost from $31,000 to $132,000 each , usually work two shifts a day . The workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totaling about $790,000 a year . So , it is estimated , a robot will save enough in salaries alone to recover its cost in little more than a year . Fujitsu Fanac 's Inaba agrees : " In our factory , the wage costs have been reduced to one fifth . In terms of per-hour productivity , there is little difference between robots and humans . However , a robot worked 24 hours a day is three times as productive " as a man who is assigned to work only one 8-hour shift . Robots also offer advantages in the efficiency and quality of their work . A Toyota engineer says that while they are slower in welding a single spot , they are faster in welding dozens of spots scattered over a car 's body . At the Panasonic TV plant , the rate of defective products is said to be only about one fiftieth of what it was in 1970 when robots were just starting to take over jobs in the plant . There is a matter of safety . In the first incident of its kind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he tried to repair an industrial robot without cutting off the power . He accidentally activated the mechanical arm and was crushed to death . Another important issue that remains to be answered is whether the use of robots will cause a serious loss of jobs for human workers . So far , this has not happened in Japan . Industrialists say that robots have created little joblessness . In fact , they say , robots are creating new jobs for humans and are helping to ease the country 's shortage of blue-collar workers and technicians . Some of the replaced employes were scheduled to be transferred to less tedious or higher-paid jobs . Others are being retrained for different jobs with the same employer . Some managers , however , see a possible grave impact on the labor market over the long term . Yamaoka of Hitachi warns : " As multipurpose intellectual robots gradually become more advanced and diversified in the types of work they can do , the day may come when many humans will be deprived of job opportunities . " But he does not expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Importance growing . Robot production has become a major industry in Japan , with more than 130 companies competing in the fast-growing field . Total output has increased at a rate of about 30 percent a year and is expected to continue booming at an average annual rate of 35 percent . Domestic sales totaled 255.2 million dollars for 18,700 units in 1980 . Production in 1981 should top 25,000 units valued at 347 million . Projections are that sales will approach 3.5 billion dollars by 1990 . As an example of what future robots may be able to do : Visitors to a show at Tokyo 's National Science Museum last November saw a 59-inch-tall robot capable of walking to the right or left , singing a song and telling a story ? all in response to voice commands . Yet scientists point out that there is a limit to robots ' capabilities . In the words of Yasuhiro Komori , general manager of the Japan Industrial Robot Association : " Anything requiring creative thinking or emotion can not be expected of robots .
