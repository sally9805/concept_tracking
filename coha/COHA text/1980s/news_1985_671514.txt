The Royals , who were given little chance to win their division title , the American League pennant or the World Series , trampled the Cardinals , 11-0 , in the seventh game of the Series , capping their second remarkable comeback in post-season play . In both the league playoff and the Series , the Royals fell behind , three games to one , then fought back and won the last three games. // " When we got out of St. Louis alive and they didn ' t put us away there , I felt we had a good chance , " Dick Howser , the Kansas City manager , said , rubbing his champagne-stung eyes . " Our players were always confident . I ' m not talking about a rah-rah kind of confidence . You could just see it in their eyes that they thought they could win. " // // Call From the President // Howser and several other members of the Royals ' organization spoke with President Reagan by a special telephone hookup amid the bedlam of their clubhouse. // " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President told Howser , " but I couldn ' t resist making a call and telling you how great everything is . I ' m supposed to be nonpartisan on this , but congratulations on a great finish. " // Mr. Reagan also spoke with Whitey Herzog , the St. Louis manager , but his words were of little consolation to Herzog or his stunned and dejected players. // " We can ' t forget about it , " Tom Herr , the Cardinals ' second baseman , said . " It ' s something we ' ll remember the rest of our lives. " // Only four teams previously had won the World Series after trailing three games to one , and because the playoff went to a seven-game format this year , the Royals became the first team ever to rally from two 3-1 deficits in the same postseason . Furthermore , they are the first team ever to lose the first two games of the World Series at home and wind up winning it . And in winning it tonight , they matched the most lopsided seventh-game victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many , but the most dazzling was the five-hit pitching of Bret Saberhagen , the 21-year-old brand new father , who never was in trouble . Then there were the hitters . George Brett collected four hits and Darryl Motley rapped three hits and drove in three of the team ' s first six runs , the first two with a second-inning home run against John Tudor. // Steve Balboni and Lonnie Smith , playing on his third different World Series championship team in six years , each drove in two runs as the Royals scored more runs than they had in any game this year except two. // Mike Ferraro , the third-base coach who ecstatically sent all those runners home , reflected on the finish and said : " I woke up today thinking about how this had been such a frustrating year not scoring runs . I said wouldn ' t it be nice if we had a blowout tonight . At one point during the game , I said to Brett , ' You don ' t know how good this feels after going through 160 some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I told you I ' d take care of you . ' I said , ' Did you have to wait until the last day ? ' " // Besides the memory of the Royals ' winning on this last day , though , the most vivid picture of this World Series undoubtedly will be that of Joaquin Andujar , the fiery-tempered St. Louis pitcher , twice charging the home plate umpire and then being pushed and dragged , screaming , from the field. // " It ' s a frustration that builds up , " Tito Landrum , Andujar ' s mild-mannered teammate , said , " a valve that has to be released . Tonight , it exploded. " // Andujar , the fourth of five pitchers Herzog used in the fifth inning , in which the Royals erupted for their last six runs , was angered on consecutive pitches to Jim Sundberg when Don Denkinger , the umpire , called them ball three and ball four . Both pitches appeared to be inside. // Andujar , a 21-game winner with only one victory since Aug. 23 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players quickly stepped between them . Herzog came out of the dugout , not to get between the two but to yell at the umpire , who he felt had made a wrong call on a pivotal play the night before . Denkinger ejected Herzog and , after Andujar vehemently protested the next pitch too , he also threw out the pitcher. // As Andujar neared the umpire after ball four , Nick Leyva , the Cardinals ' first-base coach , grabbed him from behind and restrained him . When the umpire ejected him , the pitcher grew even angrier . Mike Roarke , the St. Louis pitching coach , grabbed him and pushed and dragged him from the field and into the dugout. // It was the hottest the Cardinals had been the entire Series . They scored a total of 13 runs in the seven games and they had a team batting average of . 185 , the lowest ever for a team in a seven-game Series. // Saberhagen , who was named the Series ' most valuable player one day after his wife gave birth to a 9-pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-hitting of the team that led the National League this year in average and runs scored . He held the Cardinals to one run in the third game and none tonight. // In this game , he gave up one single in each of three innings , then allowed consecutive singles by Andy Van Slyke and Terry Pendleton with one out in the seventh . However , he recovered quickly , retiring Steve Braun and Darrell Porter on fly balls . He then retired the last six batters , ending the Series by getting Van Slyke to fly to Motley in right field. // The only questionable moment he had in the game , Saberhagen said , was in the fifth when the Andujar incidents prolonged the inning. // " I was really concerned about them taking so much time , " said Saberhagen , the Royals ' 20-game winner . " It seemed the umpires weren ' t good about getting things going . It was hard on me . I ' m superstitious about how many pitches I throw between innings , and I had to take a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cardinals ' 21-game winner , who had won the first and fourth games . A pitcher whose fine control enabled him to have a season average of just 1. 6 walks per nine innings , the left-hander walked Balboni just before Motley hit a home run in the second inning , then walked three more Royals in the third , forcing home a run with the third walk. // " I didn ' t throw strikes , plain and simple , " Tudor said dejectedly . " I suppose there ' s a reason . I don ' t know what it is. " // Motley hit his home run with a fresh bat after he broke the one he was using by slamming it against the ground after hitting a long foul . The bat boy brought him two bats and , he said , smiling , " I picked the one with the best wood. " // Not much wood was needed in the third inning . The three walks and Brett ' s accidental infield single - the ball hit his bat as he fell away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after Bill Campbell relieved Tudor , Balboni singled home two more. // When Tudor left the mound , he went into the dugout and angrily swung at a metal fan . He cut the index finger of his left hand and needed stitches. // " It was a dumb mistake on my part and that ' s all there is to it , " he said. //
