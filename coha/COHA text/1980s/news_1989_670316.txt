Rudolph Giuliani was on television again last weekend , reciting his record of convictions in insider-trading cases and boasting that his effort as U.S. attorney " has gotten Wall Street to start concentrating on ethics and the law . " With his voice tuned to a monotone and his face offering no hint of a smile , he came across as smart , intense , moralistic  --  and almost eerily cold . That style has served the Manhattan federal prosecutor well . But yesterday , when he announced his resignation , he launched a new phase of his career , one that may well include the pursuit of political office . Although the 44-year-old Mr. Giuliani declined to discuss any political plans at a news conference , he has told friends that he is leaving the U.S. attorney ' s post to try a run for mayor of New York . In a city angry about crime , dangerous and dilapidated schools and municipal corruption , a no-nonsense prosecutor would seem to have at least a long-shot chance . On the other hand , he will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even cruel . Commenting on Mr. Giuliani ' s announcement just four days before Christmas that Florida businessman Paul Bilzerian had been indicted on charges of securities and tax fraud , Mr. Bilzerian ' s lawyer accuses Mr. Giuliani of being a bit short on kindness . The lawyer , Arthur F. Matthews , says Mr. Giuliani " would have been an even better public servant than he ' s been if he had a little more compassion and flexibility . " Whatever his future , Mr. Giuliani has already made an extraordinary mark , with his war against insider trading and securities fraud on Wall Street and , more broadly , with his aggressive use of informants , wiretaps and the federal racketeering law . He has been particularly effective against organized crime , attaining the conviction of seven Mafia dons . He also prosecuted officials in the administration of New York City Mayor Edward Koch , who could well be a future political opponent . His most visible failure was the recent acquittal of Bess Myerson , a former Koch aide and confidante . No matter who succeeds Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue pursuing investigations currently in the pipeline . Prosecutors and defense lawyers credit Mr. Giuliani with transforming the prosecutor ' s role throughout the country by serving as a model for tougher enforcement of laws against political and financial corruption . And in many cases , such as insider trading and shady government dealings , he has attacked practices long accepted as the way the game is played . " What used to be winked at is no longer acceptable , " says Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz . " The message is : Don ' t look for guidance from what has been acceptable conduct up to now . The prosecution will always be a step ahead of you . " To supporters , such as former U.S. Attorney General William French Smith , Mr. Giuliani is a pioneer in the war on bad guys . To detractors , such as New York attorney Edward Costikyan , Mr. Giuliani poses a threat to fundamental civil liberties . Mr. Costikyan acknowledges , for example , that the federal racketeering law may be an effective tool in encouraging guilty pleas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying the Inquisition was a good thing . " Mr. Giuliani has " been the most prominent prosecutor since Thomas Dewey and the most unloved for that reason , " says Alan Bromberg , an expert on securities law at Southern Methodist University . On Wall Street , Mr. Giuliani is particularly unloved . The Securities and Exchange Commission initiated many of the insider-trading investigations that have resulted in guilty pleas during the past three years . But it was Mr. Giuliani who announced a crackdown on Wall Street corruption , denounced the " systemic " nature of insider-trading abuses and turned cases into crusades . Along the way , he induced many parties to plead guilty to crimes related to insider trading ; they ranged from members of the so-called Yuppie Five ring , to Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. investment banker Dennis Levine , to takeover speculator Ivan F. Boesky and then to Drexel itself . Drexel , which last month agreed to plead guilty to six felony counts and to pay $650 million in penalties and civil restitution , is the biggest notch in his belt . Working with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of securities-law violations to get Justice Department approval for racketeering charges against the firm . Mr. Giuliani ' s love affair with the potent and controversial Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law began long ago , in a different forum . In 1981 , after stints as an assistant U.S. attorney and in private practice , Mr. Giuliani went to Washington as the No. 3 official in the Justice Department . Then-Attorney General Smith says Mr. Giuliani , who was in charge of law enforcement and supervised the 93 U.S. attorneys nationally , decided that RICO was underused . Mr. Giuliani began to promote its use to others in the department and to the U.S. attorneys , particularly in organized-crime and drug-related cases , Mr. Smith says . " If you check the statistics , the number of cases brought under RICO since 1981 dwarfs those previously . It ' s been used all over the country , perhaps not as dramatically as in New York , but very effectively , " Mr. Smith says . Mr. Giuliani did more than just recommend the use of RICO , says William Weld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who later headed the Justice Department ' s criminal division . " Mr. Giuliani in 1981 was personally responsible for hiring virtually all of the 93 U.S. attorneys , and he hired them all in his image , " says Mr. Weld , now in private practice . Mr. Giuliani left the Justice Department to put his ideas into practice in New York in 1983 . Using RICO , he attacked the leadership of New York ' s major organized-crime families and got convictions of seven highranking Mafiosi . ( Mr. Giuliani , an ItalianAmerican , doesn ' t shrink from the word " Mafia " to describe organized-crime families . ) Still pending is his unprecedented attempt , in a RICO indictment of 39 mob figures , to expunge the leadership of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters . Mr. Giuliani hardly invented RICO  --  it was passed by Congress in 1970  --  but he did use it aggressively and push it into a new area , securities-related fraud . The law is so effective partly because it allows a prosecutor to pull together lesser criminal acts such as tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishable by as much as 20 years in prison for each count . Also , under RICO , a defendant ' s assets can be frozen as security immediately upon indictment . The government ' s ability to tie up assets prior to a trial pressures defendants to plead guilty to lesser charges in order to regain immediate use of their funds . Drexel agreed to a settlement that included guilty pleas to lesser charges . The howls by defense lawyers and others on Wall Street that the firm had been coerced still haven ' t died down . But no one questions that Mr. Giuliani ' s tactics are effective , if brutally so . The Drexel case represented Mr. Giuliani ' s second success in using RICO against a securities firm . Earlier , a federal grand jury in New York had brought RICO charges against officials of Princeton/Newport LP . After struggling for some months to survive under the pressure of the RICO indictments , the firm liquidated late last year . Mr. Giuliani ' s aggressiveness in securities matters , with both RICO indictments and garden-variety fraud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass a new insider-trading and securities-fraud enforcement law , which raised the civil and criminal penalties for crimes related to insider trading . Mr. Giuliani ' s tough stance on crime , even his use of RICO , might well stand him in good stead in any political campaign . More troublesome politically may be the reputation for meanness . He has a penchant , critics contend , for seeking publicity at defendants ' expense , for staging dramatic arrests when his case might not yet be solid , for turning the screws a bit too hard and a little too fast . Perhaps most damaging were the February 1987 arrests of top financial executives Robert Freeman , Richard Wigton and Timothy Tabor . Like Charlie Sheen ' s character in the movie " Wall Street , " Mr. Wigton of Kidder , Peabody &; Co. was placed against a wall in full view of the firm ' s stunned traders , frisked , handcuffed and led away in tears . Mr. Giuliani later dropped the charges against the three , while indicating that a new indictment was likely later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the case remains one of the biggest pieces of unfinished business  --  and potentially one of the biggest embarrassments  --  that Mr. Giuliani will leave behind . Mr. Freeman ' s attorney , Paul Curran , says he had no knowledge of when , if ever , new indictments are expected . Mr. Giuliani also is criticized by defense lawyers for conducting news conferences to announce indictments and to reveal details of alleged crimes that traditionally have been left to be proved at trial  --  with defense lawyers on hand to cross-examine witnesses . " He makes it sound like the indictment is the end of the case , " Harvard ' s Prof. Dershowitz says . The law professor says Mr. Giuliani has perfected what he calls " the singing indictment " that liberally uses organized-crime figures ' nicknames to lend a criminal flavor to their activities . When Mr. Giuliani reads an indictment , " You can hear the themes of ' The Godfather ' in the background , " Prof. Dershowitz says . Supporters such as former Attorney General Smith defend the news conferences as consistent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on crime and deterring potential malefactors . But the publicity itch takes Mr. Giuliani further than many would go . In 1986 , for example , the straight-laced prosecutor , in sunglasses and street-tough garb , joined U.S. Sen. Alfonse D ' Amato in a trip to the mean streets of New York to purchase crack  --  just to show how easy it was . Given his relatively long tenure and controversial approach , Mr. Giuliani comes in for relatively little criticism for botching cases . His office ' s conviction rate of better than 90%  --  and its record of winning many big ones  --  speaks for itself . However , there have been a few blunders , notably yesterday ' s mistrial in the stock-manipulation case against GAF Corp. and its vice chairman , James T. Sherwin . The mistrial was granted because an assistant U.S. attorney , who works for Mr. Giuliani , failed to give defense attorneys a report by an expert witness the government used in the case . No one blames Mr. Giuliani himself for the mistake , although the case is embarrassing to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicized trial on charges that she obstructed justice and committed mail fraud in a divorce-fixing case also was a mark against Mr. Giuliani ' s office . As Mr. Giuliani contemplates his future , the work of the U.S. attorney ' s office will go on  --  with important Wall Street-related investigations in progress . Benito Romano , a 39-year-old partner at Dewey , Ballantine , Bushby , Palmer &; Wood , has been named acting U.S. attorney but isn ' t expected to be named as permanent successor when Mr. Giuliani leaves office by month ' s end . Sen. D ' Amato , whose relations with Mr. Giuliani have recently been less than cordial , is understood to have told Mr. Giuliani that he would veto Mr. Romano . Although the president appoints U.S. attorneys for each jurisdiction , the appointment generally is based on the recommendation of the senator from the president ' s party . One individual said to be a top contender for Mr. Giuliani ' s job is New York defense attorney Otto Obermaier . But if Mr. Obermaier gets the job , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of his role in representing people who have been targeted in these cases . Mr. Obermaier says he hasn ' t been offered the post but would be interested in it . In recent weeks , U.S. District Judges John F. Keenan and John Walker and U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney in the Eastern District of New York were asked to take the job but declined . Lawyers predict that the office will continue pursuing insider-trading investigations still in progress regardless of who takes over . Assuming the mandate to continue in Mr. Giuliani ' s path , a strong team of assistant U.S. attorneys will remain in place , and it is these assistants who do most of the work preparing such cases . " Rudy ' s departure won ' t have any effect on securities cases in the pipeline , " says Arthur Liman , attorney for Michael Milken , Drexel ' s junk-bond chief , who is expected to be indicted later this month . In addition , Mr. Liman says , " I believe Rudy has established an institutional policy and institutional priorities which will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deems Mr. Giuliani ' s impact so great as to be irreversible . In addition to his possible political plans , Mr. Giuliani is known to have looked for a law firm where he could hang his hat while preparing a political race  --  and where , if defeated , he could practice after the election . He recently held discussions with Dewey Ballantine about joining that firm as a partner . But according to individuals familiar with those talks , the firm ' s management committee decided earlier this month not to make Mr. Giuliani an offer . " He really wanted to come to us , " said one partner at the firm . " But in the final analysis , I don ' t think the total package was attractive to us because he couldn ' t promise us that he ' d be practicing law " rather than running for public office . If Mr. Giuliani does run for political office , questions will be raised about his ability to transfer his skills as a rigid , goal-driven prosecutor to a political post that demands flexibility and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people determine the mayor ' s . There ' s a big difference , " says Mitchell Moss , the director of New York University ' s Urban Research Center . " A prosecutor throws bombs , and a politician catches them.
