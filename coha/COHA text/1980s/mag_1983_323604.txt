Patrick Ewing comes ungently to the Big East tournament <P> The sophomore season of 7-ft . Georgetown Center Patrick Ewing has been a mean slide back to the hard times of Jackie Robinson . Signs along the way : at Providence College , EWING CA N'T READ ; at the Meadowlands in New Jersey , THINK EWING ! THINK ! ; in Philadelphia 's Palestra , EWING IS AN APE . When Ewing was introduced there someone in the crowd tossed a banana peel onto the court . T shirts and buttons have been manufactured bearing the slogan : EWING KANT READ DIS , which is also a recurring chant at the games . Not surprisingly , Patrick Ewing , 20 , has had a few fights this year . Racism is not surprising . It pervade sports and life . But the overtness of ape banners and bananas on the floor is chilling . <P> Basketball is a most intimate game . Observing a baseball or football player from a distance , the first impression of color might be the color of his uniform . But basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectators are close enough to see the players ' beards dripping sweat . Since a giant black center is no novelty , something about Ewing must be particularly affecting . " He looks like a big , bad , mean guy , " says John Thompson , his coach . " Actually he 's a big , quiet , sensitive guy . " <P> Ewing is an aggressive player . The most popular black basketball players in the world are the Harlem Globetrotters , grinning minstrels " aping " their game . But the next most popular black basketball players are those without a black presence , whose talent may be intimidating but whose style is unthreatening . Ralph Sampson , the University of Virginia 's 7-ft. 4-in. senior center , is more docile and less abused . In fact , fans are given to wondering how much better Sampson would be if he had a rougher temperament . Ewing plays angry . " The way Ewing plays , " says Thompson , " he does n't ask questions , he makes statements . " <P> Neither does he answer questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wooden , whose players frequently needed postgraduate work in smiling , Thompson has sheltered his star from the public and press . " I 'm not going to make Patrick talk to someone if he does n't want to , " Thompson says , " and usually he does n't want to . " Though just a few words from Ewing might lower the banners , Thompson wonders , " Should it be up to him ? We 've received letters from people trying to rationalize the abuse , to justify it . ' He should get used to it , ' they say . ' It comes with the territory . ' Do we want a young kid to get used to this ? "
