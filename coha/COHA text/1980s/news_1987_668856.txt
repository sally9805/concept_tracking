Q-My wife and I just received an inheritance . We owe about $73 , 000 on our home , which has a value of about $105 , 000 . With the inheritance we could pay off both mortgages on our home  --  one at $55 , 000 at 10 percent interest and the other , a second , $17 , 000 at 11 percent . The $73 , 000 payoff would leave us with about $1 , 000 in liquid savings . What would be your recommendation about investing the money ? A-Let ' s not get too rapturous about owning the home free and clear . While it ' s desirable , it would be foolish to strip yourselves down to a liquid $1 , 000 in savings . Why don ' t you pay off the second mortgage ( or trust deed ) , which would get $17 , 000 of your indebtedness off your back , but still leave you about $57 , 000 to invest in something with some growth potential , such as a well diversified mutual fund ? I don ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your 30s or 40s , I ' d lean toward a fund specializing in growth ( low-yielding ) common stocks , one in which all of the dividends and capital gains are automatically reinvested . If you ' re in your 50s , go for a " balanced " fund ( one specializing in more established stocks and a smattering of bonds ) . If you ' re getting close to retirement try a bond fund . I ' m not saying that paying your first mortgage off isn ' t a good idea . Since you ' ve been paying off both the first and the second without any real sweat , why not take the monthly payment that you ' ve been making on the second mortgage and accelerate the payment on the principal of the first in the same amount ? You ' re already conditioned to do this , and you ' d have the best of both worlds . The investment in the mutual fund will give you both an easily liquidated " cushion " and a leg up in terms of retirement income . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ll be building up equity in your home and speeding up the payoff . Q-My sister and her husband are selling their house , which they bought new about five years ago . When they and their neighbor moved in , the surveyor ' s stakes were gone because the lawn had been graded , so they weren ' t sure where the lot line was . When they had the house surveyed to sell it , it turned out that a tree the neighbor had planted was in their yard . They haven ' t discussed it with their neighbor , but he moved the surveyor ' s stake so that the tree appears to be in his yard . Should they try to straighten the problem out ? It seems like they are either selling their neighbor ' s tree , or he ' s appropriating a part of their yard . If he moves the tree to his yard , will they be in trouble since the sales contract includes " all plantings " ? A-What your sister and her husband are doing , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planted a tree for them . That ' s pretty sly of him to move the stakes back to the other side of the tree , but it ' s not going to work . The tree is on your sister ' s property . For the sake of harmony , and because the whole thing was an honest mistake on the neighbor ' s part ( at least in the beginning ) , I ' d give the neighbor the opportunity to move the tree . I ' d also explain the background of the situation to all prospective buyers , although I doubt that any sale is going to be lost because one immature tree isn ' t a part of the package . But the time to take care of this is before any sale is final . It could prove to be a major hassle between the next owner and the neighbor in 5 or 10 years when the tree has picked up some weight and bulk . Q-In a recent column you suggested that a woman with a modest income , but with a $20 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down payment . You said the mortgage payment would be about 28 percent of her monthly income . I think that you forgot about the monthly association fees which aren ' t fixed and could put her in a bind . A-That ' s a good point , but  --  as with any buyer of a single-family home  --  the 28 percent standard ratio between monthly income and mortgage principal and interest still leaves a host of other expenses for maintenance , insurance and what-not which , like the homeowners ' fee , have to be budgeted , too , out of the other 72 percent of income . It was also one of the reasons I suggested that she keep ( and invest ) $5 , 000 of her divorce settlement . But you ' re quite right  --  such fees , just like rent , can accelerate.
