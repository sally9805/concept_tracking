THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT IS UNDER FIRE from both right and left over its 1985 draft budget and its handling of civil servants . Former Prime Minister Raymond Barre has launched an attack on the budget , voicing doubts about its underlying economic assumptions and predicting that it will lead to " financial failure . " The Communist Party warned that it " creates the conditions for justified social explosions . " And even within the ranks of the ruling Socialist Party , there is clamor for change in some of the budget ' s provisions . At the same time , civil-servant unions are calling for a 24-hour strike on Oct. 25 to protest the government ' s decision to raise their salaries by only 2% as of Nov. 1 . This will bring the total wage increase for public-sector employees to 3% for 1984 . Edmond Maire , the leader of the Socialist-leaning union , Confederation Francaise Democratique du Travail , called the government ' s refusal to negotiate with unions on the increase " frankly unacceptable . " Mr. Barre wasn ' t any more impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s hypotheses are doubtful , that taxes will drop significantly less than the government has promised , that the budget does nothing for French industry , that the state ' s claims that public expenditure is dropping is based solely on accounting devices and that , in fact , the public deficit will rise substantially . Rather than cutting taxes , Mr. Barre said , the government should have reduced public expenditures . In its current form , he says , the budget is a " burden on the future " that will lead to a devaluation of the French franc.  --  - PORTUGAL IS BEING BYPASSED by Europe ' s economic recovery . Partly as a result of the government ' s austerity program , the Portuguese economy is crawling along at near-zero growth and isn ' t expected to start expanding again until next year . Industry and labor are equally hard hit . Investment is plummeting , unemployment is stuck at 11% of the labor force , inflation is running ahead at 30% , and the public-sector budget gap is widening from last year ' s deficit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both business and moderate unions concluded they hadn ' t any alternative but to go along with the tough fiscal programs urged on Portugal by both the International Monetary Fund and the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development . But now , they are getting increasingly restive about the policies being pursued by the center-left coalition of Prime Minister Mario Soares . One labor leader worries that the investment slump will make Portuguese companies vulnerable to takeover attempts by big European concerns after Portugal joins the Common Market later this decade . " Unless the government acts decisively now to modernize the economy , Portugal will be turned into a hunting estate for international capitalism , " says Manuel Torres Couto , head of the Uniao Geral dos Trabalhadores labor confederation.  --  - DOWNGRADED GRAPES : This year ' s Chianti might be declassified to table wine as heavy rains near Florence and Siena dampen hopes for a high-quality vintage . Chianti in 1984 was to bear the top classification , Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita , for the first time . Bad weather throughout Italy is expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1. 9 billion gallons.  --  - THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT ' S PROPOSALS for stimulating the business recovery are inadequate , economists say . They acknowledge that the austerity policies of Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers ' two-year-old administration have contributed to the current business upturn . Wage curbs , in particular , they say , have put the Netherlands in a more competitive international position . But , almost unanimously , they are skeptical about new proposals contained in the 1985 budget approved last week . These include a decrease in employer social-security payments by $374 million next year , and a doubling of the tax-exempt ceiling on dividend income to $288 . " Reducing the employer ' s contribution to the welfare system will have a minimal effect on big companies such as Philips , Akzo , KLM and Heineken , " says Fokko Tuin , an analyst with Kempen &; Co. , a brokerage firm . As for the inducements for buying stocks , he says , " That ' s nice for widows and orphans , but it won ' t seriously promote equity financing in the Netherlands. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . Liberacion , founded by a cooperative of Spanish journalists , is designed to be a " truly left-wing " newspaper , according to Andrens Sorel , who is overseeing the venture . The paper is financed by $320 , 000 in bank loans , $145 , 000 in donations and a $116 , 000 credit from the Labor Ministry . Mr. Sorel says the ideal readers are the former young rebels of the 1960s , " now a little elderly " and spending their time " looking at the scenery.

Two associations dedicated to preventing car accidents lost their bid for a repeal of the French auto maker ' s ads for its CX GTI Turbo . The ads emphasized the car ' s top speed , 137 miles per hour . A judge ruled that there isn ' t any law that prohibits ads touting a car ' s speed , and he noted that the ad was truthful .
