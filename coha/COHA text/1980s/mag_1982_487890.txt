Contrary to what many people think , it is n't a pleasure for any critic of ordinary integrity to be forever jumping on the creations he or she is called upon to examine . Vic  --  tor Hugo once described a powerful and vituperative critic of his day as " a poison mushroom waiting confidently to be bitten , " but I do n't think there are too many of that species around . In my own case , to write about something I admire is far more satisfying than to go on the attack . For one thing , criticism is always fullest when it adds light to an already worthy object ; for another , it stretches the mind to have to find words of love and appreciation that are n't ruined by familiarity . All this is by way of preamble to some reflections on A Doll 's Life . There 's not much I can add to what you may have already heard or read regard  --  ing this abysmal piece of work , concern  --  ing which there has been an unusual unanimity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los An  --  geles , it came to Broadway and closed after four performances . It carried down with it something more than $4 million and , temporarily at least , the reputations of its principal perpetrators , Betty Comden and Adolph Green , who wrote the book and lyrics , and Harold Prince , the director . ( Nobody seems to have noticed that it took eight producers , including a cor  --  poration , to put the thing on . ) The only justification I have for do  --  ing even the briefest post-mortem on A Doll 's Life is that the whole dismal af  --  fair has wider cultural implications than are afforded by the specific details of its ineptness and stupidity These are abun  --  dant enough : Comden and Green 's ab  --  solute lack of understanding of Ibsen 's play and of Nora , whom they turn into a silly , flirtatious creature having fun and adventure in her new life of freedom and at the same time mouthing feminist ' jargon . As further evidence there are the dreadful lyrics ( " Worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; the graceless operetta-like score ( by Larry Grossman ) ; and Hal Prince 's horrid staging , full of his increasingly tiresome mannerisms  --  everything coming down from the flies or sliding in from the wings , lit  --  tle knots of singers booming out where you do n't expect them , each bit of ac  --  tivity shaped toward an effect . My impulse was to swallow hard and shake off the memory . But there are those wider implications . A few re  --  viewers , while disliking the results , spoke of what a " good idea " it was to extend Ibsen 's play into a new space , speculating on what Nora 's life might have been like later on . Well , it was n't a good idea ; it was an atrocious one . I do n't mean that it 's foolish to ruminate , after you 've seen or read A Doll House , on what might have hap  --  pened after Nora slammed the door . The phrase itself is ' almost part of sociological folklore by now , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merriam . But to write another play as a sequel to the splendid original seems to me an appalling show of chutzpah as well as a sign of never having grasped A Doll House itself or , for that matter , the ' nature of dramatic art . Must it be said again that a play tells us what the author wishes us to know ? The famous question , " How many chil  --  dren had Lady Macbeth ? " points up the fact that had Shakespeare wanted us to know , had it mattered to his dramatic scheme , he would have told us . Similar  --  ly , had Ibsen wanted to write about Nora 's later life , he would have . In  --  deed , it can be argued that , in a way , he did write about that by fashioning Ghosts , in which Mrs. Alving  --  who , as he said , " had to come " once he 'd created Nora  --  exemplifies the earlier character 's possible fate had she stayed with Thorwald . ( Incidentally , A Doll 's Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ibsen never thought of writing directly about her , beyond the play . The dramatic substance had been given its proper shape , the human dilem  --  ma exposed , the imaginative point made . Whatever inspired Comden , Green and Prince to embark on their peculiar and ill-fated venture , a prominent ele  --  ment was surely the current belief that what 's worked in one form or medium can work in another . Plays are made into musicals , which are turned into movies and then " novelized . " Charac  --  ters are given subsequent adventures : Rocky or Superman II or III . Successful works of any kind are plundered , canni  --  balized , remodeled : 81/2 for Nine ; rock versions of Shakespeare or the Bible . The new possibilities A Doll 's Life suggests are boundless and un  --  speakable : Godot comes , the Three Sisters make it to Moscow . Still , those $4 million may serve for a while as a deterrent . q FILMS . ROBERT HATCH Inchon T f I were well disposed toward the Rev. Sun Myung Moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hagiographic farce that celebrates the Korean War exploits of his hero , Gen. Douglas MacArthur . The movie has been gleefully savaged by other reviewers , and there is no need to inveigh here against its simplistic view of history and its puerile story line . As a " special adviser , " Reverend Moon is said to have enjoyed significant control over the enterprise . Why he was per  --  mitted to do so has not been divulged , but it occurs to me that he may have backed his views with a substantial in vestment in this obviously expensive spectacle . I wonder , then , if anyone tried to warn him against engaging Sir Laurence Olivier for the central role . The Reverend Moon is adept at the mass in  --  doctrination of youth and the ac  --  cumulation of real estate , but clearly he knows nothing about the ways of Eng  --  land 's knighted actors . Sir Ralph Rich  --  ardson , Sir John Gielgud or , in this case , Sir Laurence  --  would any one of them graciously associate himself with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part called for ex  --  tensive makeup and an exotic accent ? No . He would disport himself by exercis  --  ing his powerful talent to produce out  --  rageously thick slices of ham . It is always great fun , and it usually makes a shambles of an unenterprising but inoffensive text . Inchon is neither unenterprising nor inoffensive , but Olivier indeed makes a shambles of it . His MacArthur visage looks like a papier-m  --  ch ? death mask , and his weak and reedy conversational voice ( intended , I believe , to suggest sardonic Yankee wit ) sounds like an emanation from the tomb . He displays a geriatric sprightliness that is just short of a buck and wing . The noble lines provided him at critical moments are mock-heroic gems , and Olivier delivers them , usually in close-up , with a dead  --  pan sincerity that would have a night  --  club audience rolling among the tables . In short , his is a superb performance of a stand-up comedian deflating an over  --  rated celebrity . Now I 'm by no means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adulatory memorial ; I 've heard in fact that he expresses great personal admiration for MacArthur . Nor am I sure that the behavior of Olivier and his peers , when confronted with inadequate scripts , is entirely , or even consciously , mischievous . It may also be that , recognizing the mediocrity of the ma  --  terial , they let fly all their histrionic powers in an attempt to create a drama  --  tic occasion . But the sight of a man employing a torch to light a cigar is intrinsically comic , and the actor so engaged is hoist with his own talent , turning Inchon into a demonstration of what can happen when you hire an ac  --  tor who is much too good for the job . This time it made an ass of Sun Myung Moon . ' q
