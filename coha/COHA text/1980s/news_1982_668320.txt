First the thermal underwear . Check . Then the heavy socks , encased in Saran Wrap . Check . Then the gloves . Check . Then the hand-warmers and the hot seats on the bench . Check . And finally , the Vaseline , slathered on the arms , the face , behind the ears , even on the earlobes . Check and double check . Dave Lapham , an offensive lineman for the Cincinnati Bengals , was ready for a game of football yesterday against the San Diego Chargers , with the winner going to the Super Bowl . This wasn ' t your ordinary game of football , not your Hula Bowl with palm trees in the background , yachts at anchor in the adjacent harbor and bikinied admirers shouting , " Kick that touchdown , " as the camera panned in for closeup shots . Uh-uh . This game was played against a backdrop of icy steam rising off the nearby Ohio River , in a cold so bitter that 10 minutes after the game began , the first-aid station at Riverfront Stadium had treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was an endurance test in which the temperature and wind-chill factor ( minus-6 and minus-59 respectively at game time ) were much more important than the game plan . Everybody talks about the weather , Mark Twain said , but nobody ever does anything about it . Well , the Cincinnati Bengals did something about it yesterday . They protected themselves as best they could , and then they ignored it . And in the process , they gave the Chargers , a team from the sun country which seemed much more affected by the arctic conditions , a solid 27-7 beating . " It was like being locked in an ice chest for three hours , " said Cincinnati tight end Dan Ross , the former Northeastern star , " but maybe we were more used to it than they were . " Bengal quarterback Ken Anderson had a quick indication that yesterday was going to be a day to paste into the family scrapbook . Early in the morning , Anderson came out into what was then a temperature of minus-14 degrees , slid into the driver ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said a silent prayer . Nothing to it . The car started on the first twist of the key . The same thing happened in the afternoon when Anderson switched on the ignition of the team he quarterbacked so capably this season that he probably will be voted the league MVP . The Bengals operated smoothly all afternoon , or as smoothly as possible , given the conditions . Though the yardage totals for each team were comparable , the Chargers turned the ball over four times , and each time , it cost them . " Worry about the cold ? " repeated Anderson in response to a question . " You mean , say , Jeez , what ' ll we do , it ' s 50 below zero ' ? You can ' t do that . You have to able perform under the conditions handed to you . " Anderson performed this way : 14 completions in 22 throws for 161 yards and two touchdowns , plus five vital runs for 39 yards . The quarterback ' s main concern was to keep his hands warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football . " If you let them get cold , " he said , " they never seem to warm up again . " Anderson , however , doesn ' t like that little hand-warming pocket so many quarterbacks wear at their belt in cold weather . He kept his hands toasty in a more elementary way , by sticking them down the front of his pants between plays . " Embarrassing ? No , why should it be ? It does the job . " Anderson said the only part of him that was cold during the game was his face . In fact , he said the hot seat on the bench was so warm , he had to put a jacket on top of it to sit down in comfort when the Chargers were on offense . Lapham and the Bengals ' offensive line came out in short-sleeved jerseys , but not for any psychological effect such a move might have on the Chargers orbecause it seemed the macho thing to do . " After practice Friday , we decided to do it that way , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chargers ' defense something to grab and we didn ' t want that . They don ' t call Gary Johnson ( the San Diego defensive tackle ) Big Hands ' for nothing . " Both Lapham , who grew up in Wakefield , and Ross , who comes from Everett , felt their heritage helped them cope with the weather yesterday . " We ' d go snowmobiling in weather like this , " said Ross . " And we ' d play hockey on the rink in my backyard . " Then he smiled . " But not for long . " Lapham said that when he was a kid , he ' d watch the Giants on television and then at halftime would go out and jump over snowpiles . There are very few snowpiles in San Diego . As the game shuddered to its frigid finish , hundreds of pieces of shredded newspapers , tossed into the air by the jubilant Cincinnati crazies in the stands , swirled onto the field . One piece landed at Lapham ' s feet . He picked it up , glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so as the finest hour in Bengal history reached the countdown stage , 11 half-frozen football players were grouped at their own 30-yard line , laughing at a crumpled picture of rookie wide receiver Cris Collinsworth . The temperature was still below zero , but for the Cincinnati Bengals at 3:50 yesterday afternoon , Riverfront Stadium was Camelot on a warm summer day .
