When TIME prepares a cover story , its correspondents often interview scores , sometimes hundreds , of people . The goal is to provide a fresh portrait of the subject that is accurate , revealing and comprehensive . For this week 's cover story , Correspondent Anne Constable faced one unusual difficulty : Supreme Court Justices do not talk to the press . So she launched her research by speaking at length to nearly two dozen former Supreme Court clerks , all of whom had finished their one-year stints only last summer . Explains Constable : " The newly graduated clerks are perhaps the most knowledgeable source of current information about the Justices , their relationships and the operation of the court . " <P> Undeterred by the Nine 's closed-mouth policy , Constable wrote to them asking for interviews . As usual , they proved arctically remote : every Justice who responded rejected her request . " My spirits were a bit deflated , " recalls Constable , " but my autograph collection was enhanced . " <P> In her ten years as a TIME correspondent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including a 1975 trial of Attica prison rebels and the 1982 conviction of Wayne Williams for the murder of two young blacks in the infamous " Atlanta killings . " <P> Working from TIME 'S New York bureau , Correspondent Ken Banta questioned attorneys who have argued before the Supreme Court , as well as academics who sift the court 's opinions for portents of its direction . Observes Banta : " Legal " scholars tend to frame the court 's decisions in terms of constitutional history and competing principles . Practicing lawyers are more pragmatic . They look at the Burger Court and ask : ' Which kind of case could I win before it ? Which Justices would I try to sway ? ' " <P> Associate Editor Evan Thomas , who wrote this week 's story , agrees that divining the court 's direction " is a bit like Kremlinology . " A graduate of the University of Virginia Law School , Thomas is somewhat of an expert himself , having spent two years reporting on the court for TIME and two years writing the magazine 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect the election might have on the court 's future direction , " says Thomas , " but in writing it , I was reminded of how difficult it is for anyone , even the President , to influence the court . " <P> Noting that the Justices have always objected to being called secretive , Thomas remembers , " One of them , Byron White , once told me , ' We 're the only branch of Government that explains itself in writing every time it makes a decision . ' "
