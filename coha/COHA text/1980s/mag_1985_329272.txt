Ronald Reagan has a folksy , homespun manner , but neither his policies nor his life-style quite conveys the image of a populist President . Yet there he was on national TV last week and in Colonial Williamsburg , Va. , Oshkosh , Wis. , and Malvern , Pa. , assailing a tax code that " runs roughshod over Main Street America " and calling for an end to " unproductive tax shelters , so that no one will be able to hide in the havens privilege builds . " Looking ever more fit and sounding ever more feisty , Reagan relished being back on the road , taking the offense in pursuit of the boldest initiative of his presidency : a sweeping revision of the nation 's unwieldy and loophole-loaded tax code . <P> In a forceful 20-minute TV address , the President portrayed tax reform as nothing less than " a second American Revolution . " If enacted by Congress , he predicted grandiosely , it would produce a " great new era of progress , the age of the entrepreneur . " Reform is needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " complicated , unfair , littered with gobbledygook and loopholes . " Drawing a stark comparison between today 's tax law and his proclaimed simpler and fairer plan , he implied that the choice for taxpayers will be easy . In a phrase that became the slogan of his campaign-style blitz , Reagan exhorted : " America , go for it ! " <P> The President 's plan would affect virtually every one of the 96.7 million Americans who pay federal income taxes . It would reduce the 14 tax brackets to just three : 35% , 25% and 15% . The top rate would be a hefty 15 percentage points lower than the present maximum of 50% . Overall , the Treasury Department estimates , the plan would trim 5% from the tax bills of individuals by 1990 ; the biggest reductions would go to the very poor and the very rich . Reagan would eliminate many of the tax breaks that wealthy persons in particular use to shelter their income . At the same time , he would preserve three deductions that are immensely popular with the middle class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success : those for interest paid on primary home mortgages , for gifts to charity and for medical expenses . <P> The President held out the enticing possibility that by 1990 perhaps half of all taxpayers would not have to file any returns at all . Their tax bill , or refunds , would be figured by IRS computers working with income information already supplied by employers , banks and investment managers . As it is , Reagan noted , fully two-thirds of all taxpayers do not itemize deductions . One of his goals is to increase that to 75% . <P> Reagan says his plan is " revenue neutral , " that is , in any one year it is supposed to increase or reduce federal tax collections no more than 1.5% , compared with what they would be under present law . To pay for the lower individual rates , Reagan would eliminate the deductibility of state and local taxes , including those on income , sales and property , and substantially increase the tax burden on business . Overall , corporations would pay 23% more .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
