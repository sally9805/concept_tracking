With the Administration 's requests for continued aid to the Salvadoran army and Nicaragua 's contras bottled up in Congress , an intriguing question arises : Could the U.S. funnel arms to Central America through Israel ? U.S. officials refused to address the question directly last week , but they conceded that it had the merit Of being logical . Israel has looked on Central America with a kind eye ever since Nicaragua allowed Jewish freedom fighters to ship arms into Israel under the Nicaraguan flag in the late 1940s . In return , Jerusalem has long supplied weapons to several Central American countries , including Guatemala and Honduras . Total sales this year are expected to reach $22 million . <P> The legal answer to whether the U.S. could , in effect , launder military equipment through Israel is no . The Foreign Military Sales Act of 1968 and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 both prohibit the transfer of arms and materiel from the recipient to a third country unless the President consents and Congress is notified . In reality , nothing could stop Israel from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to El Salvador and the contras . The Israelis also could increase arms shipments without consulting Washington , knowing full well that such a move would be welcomed by the White House and perhaps be rewarded in some way in the future . <P> Nothing would be wrong , of course , with Israel offering its own aid to El Salvador or the contras , even at U.S. request . Washington and Jerusalem were full of rumors last week that the subject would come up when David Kimche , director general of the Israeli foreign ministry and a former deputy chief of the Mossad , traveled to Washington . After meeting with State Department officials , however , Kimche denied that Israel had any intention of selling arms to U.S. clients in the isthmus . He said that discussions had been held on expanding technological aid to the region , like Israel 's ongoing program to control pests in El Salvador 's cotton crop . " I do not see ourselves as proxies , " he said . " I see us as an independent entity . " <P> Yet El @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance from Israel . Last month the Salvadoran government conspicuously moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem , becoming only the second nation in the world officially to recognize the holy city as Israel 's capital ( the other is Costa Rica ) . A few days later , El Salvador 's interim President , Alvaro Magaa , said that he looked forward to closer cooperation with Israel . <P> Despite the denials , the contras operating out of Honduras and Costa Rica are most likely already receiving Israeli arms , albeit indirectly and in small doses . Israel 's motive in helping the contras would not be just to curry favor with the U.S. but to strike a blow against the Palestine Liberation Organization , which helped train the Sandinistas before they overthrew the regime of Anastasio Somoza Debayle in 1979 . During a 1980 visit to Managua , P.L.O . Chairman Yasser Arafat declared to the Sandinistas that " the links between us are not new . . . Your enemies are our enemies . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
