Bears wide receiver Willie Gault made a surprise ride with the alternate U.S. two-man bobsled team during a training run Sunday and said he was satisfied with his performance . " I think my push times today proved I deserve to be here , " he said . However , he said it would probably take " a little miracle " for him to compete in the Winter Games . Gault ' s participation in the practice was unexpected because he had been scheduled to work only with the alternate four-man team . He worked as the brakeman for third-team driver Randy Will , whose regular brakeman , Mike Aljoe , moved up to work with first-team driver Brent Rushlaw . " Brent decided to go with Aljoe and Randy asked me to push with him , " said Gault , who added he hoped the two sleds that compete for the U.S. would be chosen by the best times during this week ' s practices . Coach Jeff Jost , however , said Will ' s No. 3 sled would have to be significantly better than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots . Although Will and Gault combined to produce the best U.S. time in the first run at 58. 29 seconds Sunday , they were third among the three American teams in the second run at 59. 34 . Will and Gault finished 13th overall in the practice with a time of 1 : 57. 63 . USA 1 , with Rushlaw and Aljoe , was 16th at 1 : 57. 74 and USA 2 , with Matt Roy and Jim Herberich , was 11th at 1 : 57. 51 . Gault , however , noted that his push time-judged by the time over the first 50 meters on the course-was competitive in each run . His 5. 52-second push was second to Herberich ' s time among the Americans on the first run , and his 5. 43-second push was best among the Americans on the second . A Soviet sled driven by Maris Poikans had the best time for the two runs at 1 : 55. 49 . The East German sled driven by 1984 gold medalist Wolfgang Hoppe was second at 1 : 55. 58. - The choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a controversial one , and officials worried from the start about the high winds that caused the cancellation of the men ' s downhill Sunday . It has been rescheduled for Monday , but even that is not written in stone . If the winds are still too strong for the downhill , officials will try to run the men ' s combined downhill that is skied down a shorter course .

The winds were way over the limits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hit a gust that would wipe out ( obscure ) the terrain , or someone could hit a headwind. " - Sunday ' s cancellation made it two Olympics in a row that weather has bedeviled the men ' s downhill . In Sarajevo , Yugoslavia , in 1984 , the race did not go off until 10 days after it was originally scheduled. - Dr. Ruth Westheimer , who learned to ski in Switzerland , was on hand for the downhill , and before she left offered this advice-skiers are the best lovers . " They move all the parts that are important to move , " she said . " They take risks . And they ' re not lazy . They go out in the cold and the wind , and when they come back in front of the fire with a glass of wine , it ' s very sexy . " Fine , Dr. Ruth . But didn ' t you say just last year , at a Madison Square Garden tribute to another doctor , Julius Erving , that basketball players were the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall , " she said. - ABC registered a strong showing in ratings for its telecast of the opening ceremonies .
