French voters were savoring a U.S.-style scandal last week : allegations of secret arms sales to Iran , cover-ups and illegal use of misbegotten funds . According to a government report leaked to the daily Le Figaro , President Francois Mitterrand and former Defense Minister Charles Hernu , both Socialists , were aware of the arms shipments . <P> At the center of the fuss was a French government report alleging that a Bourges munitions firm , Luchaire , sold some 500,000 artillery shells worth $120 million to Tehran between 1983 and 1986 . The alleged deal violated a government embargo against military aid to Iran . The report , written by the army controller-general , claims that Mitterrand and Hernu knew of the illicit sales as early as 1984 and did nothing to stop them . The report charges that Mitterrand 's Socialist Party may have taken kickbacks worth about $500,000 to look the other way .
