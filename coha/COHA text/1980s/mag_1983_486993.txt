prominent figures on the fundamentalist right had for years expressed dismay about network television 's " permissiveness , " its display of flesh and its extramarital innuendo , but the crusade gathered momentum and publicity with the election of Ronald Reagan . Much of the press held the Moral Majority and other New Right groups responsible for a good part of Reagan 's landslide , and the New Right " social issue " groups  --  antiabortion , antifeminist and pro-prayer  --  went on the offensive . The fundamentalist right could already speak directly to national television audiences through its satellite-relayed gospel shows . In network television , however , it recognized a national target of opportunity . The assemblage of groups that Hollywood writer Larry Gelbart calls " the far righteous " had a keen sense of how to play the press , and eventually got a huge boost from panicky advertisers . When the dust cleared , the networks , which sensed no significant audience counterpressure , had retreated from their high point of sexual titillation , indeed from controversy in general .

In his early 40s , Wildmon had for several years operated the National Federation for Decency from a tiny office in his hometown of Tupelo , Mississippi . It was as if the respectable citizens of Tupelo were finally going to get revenge on their native-born pelvis , Elvis Presley , and the whole dirty culture that had invaded their households and corrupted their children . With little staff or money , Wildmon started mobilizing fundamentalist church groups to generate thousands of letters protesting " unwholesome " TV shows . In 1977 , when ABC scheduled Soap , a sendup of sexually indulgent soap operas , it got 32,000 letters of protest , many of them from Wildmon 's followers . When ABC announced in 1980 that it was making a TV movie from Marilyn French 's feminist novel The Women 's Room , Wildmon denounced it , sight unseen , as antifamily , and letters flooded in again . * Wildmon was n't interested in the ways the movie simplified the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harangues a rapt Harvard audience about women 's freedom of choice . His campaign was sufficiently potent , though , to intimidate advertisers . According to ABC 's Brandon Stoddard , the network lost ten out of fourteen minutes of Women 's Room spot ads before the air date . The companies that withdrew their ads arguably made a bad business decision , since the show drew a splendid 28.2 Nielsen rating and a 45 share , but advertisers are generally nervous about being associated with controversy . Replacement ads came in at the last minute , but at cut rates . There were only a few letters of protest after the broadcast , but Stoddard claims that ABC lost ' " a lot of money " on a high-rated show . After Wildmon hooked up with the Rev. Jerry Falwell and the right swept the 1980 elections , the press anointed him as newsworthy . Reporters saw Falwell as a kingmaker , and threats to the power of the media are customarily good fodder for headlines . Wildmon was able to attract Falwell and other New Right leaders to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in February 1981 , just after the Reagan inauguration . The vehemently right-wing Senator Jeremiah Denton of Alabama , who had joined Wildmon in an earlier crusade against network television permissiveness , told the gathering he was ready to die in this crusade to clean up television . C.B.T.V. 's executive committee included Wildmon , Falwell deputy Ronald Godwin and prominent antifeminist Phyllis Schlafly . Falwell and Wildmon announced that monitoring groups would scrutinize the networks ' prime-time schedules for " obscenity " ( broken down into " skin scenes , " " sexual innuendo " and " implied sexual intercourse " ) , " profanity " and " violence . " By the end of June , they said , they would single out a sponsor whose commercials appeared in programs the monitors found most offensive , and then organize a boycott against that company . With Falwell 's drawing power , the founding of the coalition and the threat of a boycott were instantly big news . For months reporters uncritically relayed Wildmon 's claim that the coalition included 200 groups  --  later boosted to 300 , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not until June that a CBS correspondent reported that , of a sample of sixty organizations and individuals whom Wildmon counted in C.B.T.V. , about 30 percent denied membership . When I asked Wildmon about this , he said that he had signed cards from all 401 in his possession , and that he would not have given CBS a misleading list . " I may be from Mississippi but I 'm not stupid , " he said . Having been burned , however , he refused to give out any more totals , let alone ' names . Nor did the press get very far in probing the C.B.T.V. monitoring process , at least not until Hodding Carter Jr . ' s PBS series , Inside Story , ran a piece in the fall of 1981 in which some of the monitors were interviewed . Evidently the process had been designed by Wildmon himself . During one survey , he had been so incensed by a four-letter word uttered by Saturday Night Live 's Charles Rocket that he had threatened to double the " offensiveness ratings " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even as a warning . For months , Wildmon successfully stonewalled on the identities of his alleged 4,000 monitors , and on their training and representativeness as well . Television news shows played along , seeming to substantiate Wildmon 's scientific aura with shots of computer printout machines chugging away at C.B.T.V. headquarters . In virtual chorus , top network executives brandished their First Amendment rights . " We will not change or remove any of our programs , " declared CBS senior vice president Gene Mater . " Although TV is today 's target , movies , books , magazines and newspapers will not be far behind . " At the May 1981 CBS affiliates meeting , Thomas Wyman , president of CBS Inc. , called the Moral Majority ? C.B.T.V. 's largest constituent group ? " a constitutionally immoral minority " which threatened " to disenfranchise the real majority of viewers from making their own decisions about what to watch . " The Moral Majority and C.B.T. V. , he said , " strike at the heart of the American ideal of a free marketplace . We must make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propriety of the networks but the freedom of the airwaves . " Needless to say , the networks ' idea of " freedom of the airwaves " is their own freedom to decide what shows " the real majority of viewers " will get to choose among . But that freedom is far from absolute , and advertisers in the aggregate most pointedly possess a sort of veto power . The major advertisers , in effect , set the outer limits of what is permissible to show on television . " We have two markets , " NBC research vice president Gerald M. Jaffe said . " With a movie , there 's one audience ; whether people like it or rot , they 've still paid for the ticket . But with TV there are t ... o audiences : advertisers and people at home . With one audience , you could get very high ratings with frontal nudity , penetration , torture and people being cut up with chain saws . But Congress would shriek , and so would advertisers . It would make a hard sell for Hamburger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over programming is important , but no less important is the fact that advertiser power ordinarily comes into play only after the networks have made the essential decisions . The networks in turn vaguely take into account whether they think the major advertisers in the aggregate ( the qualification is important , as we shall see in a moment ) are going to consider a show a hospitable setting for their commercials . I asked many network programming . executives whether they took advertiser attitudes into account in deciding whether to put a show on the air . Most said no , pointing out that network television is a seller 's market , with advertisers often standing in line to buy choice time . They argued that some advertiser will turn up to buy time on any show the networks put on the air . , After all , the shows are concocted to be popular and inoffensive in the first place . But more revealing was CBS Entertainment Division president Bud Grant 's answer " We do n't , " he started to say , then interrupted himself and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of advertisers out there . We know how important it is , and they give us our weekly check , but I think that in terms of just entertainment programming we take the merits of the show into account as to whether we 'd do it or not . " The knowledge of who pays the bills ca n't be dispelled , even though it does n't always rise to consciousness Network executives internalize the desires of advertisers . CBS 's Herman Keld , who has taken part in scheduling meetings for many years , did n't qualify his answer when I asked him whether ad agencies  --  and affiliates ? are taken into account in programming decisions . " I would say they are always taken into account . Always taken into account ' ? To fathom both the power and the limits of the Coalition for Better Television ( and other pressure groups ) , we also have to understand the mechanics of advertiser time buying . To advertisers , programs amount to packaging for commercials Accordingly , what advertising agencies shop for each year in companies ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 90 percent of their buying for an entire year or a particular quarter . This is so-called up-front buying . Each spring , after the networks announce their new schedules , the agencies screen samples of the season 's shows . If the American Widget Company wants to spend $10 million over the coming year advertising its latest models , its agency calls a network sales department and says it wants to spend a certain proportion of the $10 million to reach , say , 18- to 34-year-old men during prime time . The network estimates the audience each of its shows can be expected to reach , alongwith the expected demographic breakdown . It takes into account the show 's history ( if it is a renewal ) , its lead-in and competition , the characteristics of the time slot and , in the case of a new show , the look of the pilot ( if any ) and its producer 's track record . The network might offer American Widget ten spots in show A , twelve in B , seven in C and so forth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wants only nine spots in B , but three in D. It plays one network 's offer against ancother 's . Negotiations continue . Eventually , the network and the agency agree on a price for the entire package . Whatever time the networks do n't sell up front , they sell later on , usually for less . The networks are fully aware , though , that even in a recession , network time is a seller 's market . Since a high percentage of television advertisers sell package goods , which hold up relatively well in a tight economy , rather than durables , which do n't , the networks weather recessions rather well . Time is a scarce and valuable commodity . Even at $173,000 for thirty seconds , the price of a M*A*S*H spot in 1981 , advertisers are eager to line up early . That is why the network executives who develop shows , order pilots and snake up schedules can safely assume that advertisers will buy time in virtually any show that promises to be popular . Therefore , no single advertiser can wield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think about it , network executives are likely to rule out any show that would probably offend a critical mass of advertisers . The Adventures of Ralph Nader , for instance , would be hard to sell to advertisers , even if it might promise to be a popular series ; that is where the ideological line is drawn . In the present ideological climate , however , the executives would n't think The Adventures of Ralph Nader promising in the first place , so the question of advertiser censorship would n't come up , Some advertisers and most network executives reproached the Reverends Wildmon and Falwell not only for threatening network power but also for crediting advertisers with a control , and therefore a responsibility , they had long since lost . But Falwell and Wildnion well knew that advertiserS no longer exercise direct control over programs , as they did in the early days of television . Their strategy , in effect , was to intimidate advertisers into reasserting control  --  by holding them responsible . Like the blacklisters of the 1950s , they understood that advertisers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directors and producers often gaze back fondly on the " golden age " of the 1950s , when the airwaves were full of live drama . However , in their nostalgia they conveniently overlook the fact that advertisers and their agencies not only blacklisted the actors , writers and directors listed in the Red Channels registry , but regularly read scripts a day or two in advance of shooting . Many advertisers were sole sponsors : The U.S. Steel Hour , Armstrong Circle Theater , The Lux Show Starring Rosemary Clooney . Sponsors that bought whole shows , or major portions , did n't shrink from direct censorship . The economics of the industry changed the advertising system and increased network control at the expense of advertisers . The number of American households with television sets doubled from 1954 to 1964 , and rose from 56 percent to 92 percent . As the television set became an obligatory domestic appliance , the price of commercial time rose steeply . Advertisers could no longer afford to buy entire shows , although companies like Hallmark , I.B.M . and Xerox bought occasional showcase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertising agencies came to feel that scatter-buying was a more efficient way of reaching audiences . The quiz-show-rigging scandal of 1958 , which at first brought the industry a wave of bad publicity and Congressional investigations , in the long run served the networks ' drive to stabilize production under their own command . Soon after the scandal broke , the networks cleaned house in a number of ways . For instance , they upgraded their broadcast standards divisions . At CBS , president Frank Stanton set down an explicit rule : Advertisers would no longer be permitted to read scripts in advance and demand changes if they thought their corporate image at risk . Instead , the network would permit them to screen filmed episodes and withdraw ads from particular ones . Many hands now paid the piper , and the piper  --  the network  --  called the tune . The quiz-show scandal also accelerated the shift to filmed shows , which were not only easier to police but potentially much more remunerative for networks and production companies alike , since they were reusable commodities . The shift to film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been proceeding for several years . Moreover , the top sponsors now preferred to be associated with the stars and standardized formats of episodic series . The tainted quiz shows went off the air in the fall of 1958 . The next fall , there were thirty new Hollywood film series on the air . The new system was in place , and it left the networks perfectly poised to keep ad rates climbing faster than production costs and license fees . But it left them with one lingering nuisance  --  advertiser cancellations True , prime-time spots are a seller 's market , but advertisers still have the right to cancel . Ad agencies and larger individual advertisersstarted contracting with screening agencies based in New York , which monitor forthcoming series episodes . If the screening agency thinks an episode is potentially troublesome to an advertiser , it flags the ad agency , which looks at the show itself . An ad agency or advertiser sometimes learns about a sexually charged episode from a network press release or a newspaper or TV Guide article . In that caseL CBS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in line , people who may not be as sensitive . Maybe it 's a show on toxic shock syndrome , and because they had a problem with Rely tampons , maybe P &G; Procter &; Gamble says , ' Hey , I really do n't want to be in that show tonight . ' And so we say , ' O.K. , we 'll flip you to next week . ' Or let 's say we 're running a movie and there are a lot of car crashes , and we 've got Ford automotive in there . But they want to run during this period of time . You might try to flip-flop , week for week . Instead of running on March 1 , you run on March 8 , and you get another advertiser to move back . You go to the other advertiser and he says , ' Well , how come Ford does n't want to run in there ? ' And you say , ' Because there are nine car crashes . ' The guy says , ' Sure , I 'll move . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network offers the spot to other clients , usually for a lower price . " Depending on how well we do our job , " the executive says , " we can lose a little money , a lot of money or no money . " In early 1981 , there were only six or eight last-minute cancellations a month at CBS , usually for violent movies . But a few months later , as press coverage gave the Coalition for Better Television increased momentum , the networks began to grow nervous about the rising rate of withdrawals . Producers and writers smelled incipient censorship . In May , the industry 's elite held a summit conference in palmy Ojai , near Los Angeles . Although it had been called months earlier to address the threat of pressure groups across the ideological spectrum , there was only one pressure group whose spirit stalked the manicured lawns of the Ojai Valley Inn . This was what Grant Tinker called the " galvanizing specter " of the fundamentalist right , " the first group to attack the entire medium . " At Ojai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Practices department , rattled the assemblage of producers , writers , advertisers and network executives when he told them that in recent weeks there had been an increase in the number of advertisers " asking to be relieved of their obligations to a par , ticular program " The requests involved less than 2 percent of ABC 's shows , but the network had not publicly acknowledged any such trouble before . The statements of television 's major advertisers sounded defensive , even panicky . Bristol-Myers 's Marvin Koslow summed up their views when he said , " I know they have female mud-wrestling in Evansville , Indiana . I 've been there . But people do n't want it in their homes . " Tom Ryan of Gillette said that his company had indeed increased its withdrawals in the previous year , although not , he insisted , because of pressure from fundamentalist groups . It was simply that Gillette did n't want to be associated with the networks ' " gratuitous sex and violence . " Vice president F. Kent Mitchel of General Foods ( television 's secondlargest advertiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his company was withdrawing ads was on the rise , to about a hundred a year . Mitchel also expressed concern about sex and violence . At the time , General Foods was being boycotted by a Church of Christ campaign headed by the Rev. John Hurt of Joelton , Tennessee , for buying spots it  - -  harlte 's Angels , among other shows , but Mitchel said that the boycott was n't hurting sales . After all , it is n't easy to determine which brands on the supermarket shelf are General 's . General Foods might , however , have feared that Reverend Wildmon 's cadres , with the visible help of Reverend Falwell , would be better organized and more numerous than Reverend Hurt 's . But corporate timidity is not necessarily so rational . Companies are not in business to defend freedom of expression , and even a few letters can make them fearful of losing money , the only fear that counts . The question of how boycotts actually affect advertisers was raised at Ojai by then-CBS commentator Jeff Greenfield in a conversation with Gail Smith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( television 's third-largest advertiser ) . Greenfield said that if General Motors was boycotted , and if the company lost 10,000 sales to people who would n't be caught dead parking Chevies in their church parking lots , the loss would add up to something like $75 million . Gail Smith nodded , jabbing his finger for emphasis : " And we 've lost ' em for four years ! " Later he added with indignation , " We 're not in the business of antagonizing people . I do n't think our company will be hit , but God help the companies that are ! " The advertisers ' case of nerves at Ojai proved to be a preview of a more dramatic public event . In mid-June , two weeks before Wildmon was scheduled to hold a press conference announcing a boycott , Owen B. Butler , chairman of the board of Procter &; Gamble , which is far and away television 's biggest spender , stunned a Hollywood audience when he announced that , despite the company 's concern about C.B.T.V. 's methods , " we think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views about gratuitous sex , violence and profanity . " During the 1980-81 season , Butler said , P &G; had " withdrawn sponsorship from over fifty programs , including movies , for reasons of taste . " In a way , not much was new . As the speech itself and sever -0 press reports failed to make clear , Butler meant fifty discrete prime-time series episodes and movies , not entire series Fifty programs add up to about 3 percent of P &G's; prime-time total . But the big news , which the press proceeded to inflate , was that Butler was saying this out loud . Why ? Was business swinging right with Reagan in the White House ? Was P &G; trying to co-opt Wildmon and to avoid boycott ? Reaction to Butler 's speech was immediate . Some advertisers and agency executives were privately dismayed at the public cave-in . One Madison Avenue executive told me that Butler had single-handedly kept Wildmon 's crusade alive . General Mills told C.B.T.V. that it would set its own standards , thank you . But Butler 's speech was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other companies to develop policies along those lines . " said Joseph Block , PepsiCo vice president of public relations . Representatives of at least two major companies -- SmithKline and Miles Laboratories -- met secretly with Wildmon and tendered assurances that they were on the side of clean TV . SmithKline even wrote to the networks to express " concern " about " the level of gratuitous sex and violence , " The Reverend Wildmon was gratified , and in a telephone interview took credit for Butler 's action . By going public , Butler helped legitimize Wildmon  --  and also handed him his out . Two weeks later , Wildmon held his long-ballyhooed press conference in Washington , and announced that the boycott was off , at least temporarily , because it was unnecessary " Those advertisers that were not concerned during our monitoring period , " he said , " are now concerned . " Network executives crowed that the victory was theirs , insisting they had not budged , would not budge and had succeeded in warding off a threat to free expression rivaling the burning of books . Some pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the real thing would have been . If network-commissioned polls were accurate , the coalition had more support among America 's leading advertisers than among the population at large . Wildmon had to have been mindful of a poll commissioned by ABC which suggested that as little as 1.3 percent of the population would support a product boycott . NBC produced a poll to like effect showing that people who associate themselves with the Moral Majority watch about the same kinds of pi ? grams as everybody else . With several major advertisers on the run . there was no reason for Wildmon to press his luck At this point one Madison Avenue executive opined that the coalition was " melting away I suspect we 're dealing with ten people and a mimeograph machine . " But he granted that at the networks . " everybody is a little more careful . " The coalition ' s hetes noires , including Dallas and Three 's Company . were safe as long as their ratings remained irreproachable , but Wildmon might have made the margin of differert &; in keeping new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Low necklines were raised , and gays were dispatched to the closet again . The networks adjusted to pressure as they customarily do , by trimming whatever might make vociferous enemies . During the past decade . TV 's treatment of homosexuals has been something of a bellwether . Network executives like to travel down the middle of the road , as they construe it . In 1972 , they were beginning to think the road was veering toward the left That was the year ABC commissioned the movie That Certain Summer . in which Hal Holbrook played a homosexual struggling to explain himself to his son . ABC 's Standards and Pi actices hired a psychiatrist and a lawyer as consultants io " balance " the script . They wanted the writers . Richai d Levinson and William Link , to add a police officer or " an Archie Bunker character " to condemn homosexuality , to defuse the prejudices of " latent homosexual viewers " Finally , Levinson and Link agreed to write in new lines A , the ino of the movie . abet the homosexual herosays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most people , I guess  --  think it 's wrong ... they say it 's a sickness . . they say it 's something that has to be cured , " they added , " Maybe they 're right . I do n't know . , I do know that it is n't easy . If I had a choice , it 's not something I 'd pick for myself . " Gay liberationists ' damned them , and later they said they regretted making the concession . -e Subsequently , the networks tilted against the guardians of orthodox morality . They began to send scripts to gay consultants routinely " Anything that crops up in a script that even is remotely gay , " said writer Allan Burns , " they get it . And they really make themselves heard . " Whenever Lou Grant dealt with gays , the writers received " interminable phone calls , " Burns said , Liberal writers thought the well-organized gay lobby had somehow acquired veto power , and resented it . Ernest Kinoy ( who wrote Roots , Roots II , Skokie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black lobby could not keep Beulah Land off the screen , but that it would be hard to sell the idea of a " program which involved a hero who is a homosexual and is distressed about it and goes to an analyst , and they decide that this is not a good way to be ; and so he works on it , because the analyst says , yes , this is a character disorder , and he becomes much improved You can handle homosexuality  --  as long as you handle it in a lovely , tolerant fashion that will not upset the gay-liberation lobby . " Nigel McKeand , who produced Family , agrees that " no one can ( whether you believe this or not ) say that , for instance , homosexuality is infantile , and it is art absurd way to lead your life , and it 's an arrested development . You can say two lesbians should be allowed to live in peace . " At Ojai , the story circulated of a TV-movie script about a woman who left her husband , had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standards and Practices had approved the story , but at the script stage said , " We 're deeply concerned about the last scene , " in which the woman fell into her husband 's arms and said , " It 's good to be home again . " Standards said , " Do n't you realize that will offend every lesbian in America ? " The line was cut . In the end , the movie was n't made . In 1981 , the gay lobby could still improve images , but it could n't get movies made . Political winds can be hard to track ; producers learn to tack and trim . In 1976 , Family ran an episode in which the teen-age son discovered his best friend was a homosexial . The show got a high rating , whereupon ABC displayed what McKeand calls " an unseemly haste to get another homosexual show on . " Family prepared an episode for the next season in which the younger daughter , played by Knsty McNichol , found out one of het teachers was a lesbian . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gather . It was the autumn of the Briggs ballot initiative , which would have barred homosexuals from teaching in public schools in California . The news was full of stories about Anita Bryant 's crusade against gay rights , and ABC wanted to defer the episode until after the election and bury it opposite The Godfather . The network did n't want to have to give equal time , it said . It was afraid viewers would think the McNichol character was a homosexual . McKeand insisted that the show was innocuous . " For Christ 's sake , " he told Standards and Practices chief Al Schneider , " Lillian Hellman wrote The Children 's Hour fifty years ago . This does n't even make the statement that The Children 's Hour makes . It simply says , Do n't dump on someone because of their problems or their proclivities . " He persuaded Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg , who owned the show , to i. , Kercise their influence . He reminded Schneider of ABC 's " unseemly haste " and argued that to present a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the climate had turned nasty . In the end , with Spelling and Goldberg 's help , the episode was aired as scheduled . In 1981 , although an actor with Tony Randall 's clout could play a " homosexual " in Love , Sidney , the character was stripped of all sexuality . The way NBC read the political climate , it was important to satisfy the gay lobby that Sidney Shorr 's image was n't derogatory , while satisfying the " far righteous " that it was n't favorable . In the pilot of Love , Sidney , a TV movie called Sidney Shorr , there were a few references suggesting that Sidney had once had a male lover . The series Sidney , however , was a man without a sex life . His homosexuality was essentially a plot device to keep his relationship with the young woman , Laurie , platonic . In the pilot , Sidney talked the pregnant and unmarried Laurie out of having an abortion and pledged to care for both her and her child . Sidney was a 1980s version of Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homosexuals and family traditions at the same time . Oliver Hailey , who wrote the pilot , told me that " if the Moral Majority could just see it , they 'd love it . Sidney 's a throwback . He 's pro-family . He 's almost a prude about sex . " For all that , the show was " a timid groundbreaker , " Hailey said after the pilot aired . " I felt everyone beginning to panic . " Randall denied that the network pressured him to alter the character , but Hailey said that Sidney 's homosexuality had been toned down in successive drafts . Randall defended Sidney as an authentic middle-aged gay type , and he fought to keep Sidney gay ( if inactively so ) . Newt Deiter , the much-consulted head of the Gay Media Task Force , was shown the pilot script , and he was paid to answer the simple question : Are there homosexuals like Sidney Shorr ? He told NBC that Sidney did , in fact , correspond to a sexless , sublimating type of homosexual . Deiter told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty projects  --  movies , pilots and series episodes  --  involving gay characters . " At this point , " he said in the fall of 1981 , " I know of five . Now something has to be so superb that it can overcome the presumption against a gay show . " Richard Levinson said he doubted That Certain Summer could get made in this atmosphere . In May 1981 , affiliate managers in Salt Lake City ; Biloxi , Mississippi ; Baton Rouge , Louisiana ; and Columbia , Missouri , told me they had not noticed any upsurge of fundamentalist mail . Nevertheless , the networks were convinced the popular pendulum was swinging away not just from shows about homosexuality but from titillation shows featuring the female body . What the industry called the " jiggle " genre had been distinctly overexposed . On top of this , the coalition was beating the drums , arousing the public and intimidating advertisers . Norman Lear organized People for the American Way to fight the New Right , but he and other Hollywood liberals shared Reverend Wildmon 's distaste for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jiggling . No prominent voice in the industry , except the producers of shows like Three 's Company ( who warned against another wave of Red Channels-style blacklisting ) , was prepared to stand up for T &A.; The upshot was that by the fall of 1981 , jiggle was conspicuous by its absence from the new schedule , and the half-draped , alluring male body was more evident than that of the female . The " far righteous " had succeeded in their limited objectives . Partly for that reason and partly because of disagreements over strategy , the coalition dropped out of sight . Reverend Falwell decided to concentrate on other New Right issues When Reverend Wildmon went public again , it was to call for a boycott of NBC 's movie Sister , Sister , and then for a boycott of NBC itself  --  because of its alleged anti-Christian bias . This time the press paid little attention , and Wildmon 's media star set .

If they were capable of governing , the war would have been unnecessary . Since they are n't , the Israelis should not have started fighting . All this may seem an elementary exercise in logic , yet it was too advanced for people in Washington and Jerusalem to comprehend . Why was that so ? After all , Washington and Jerusalem are swarming with intelligence experts  --  experts on strategy , international affairs , the Soviet Union , the Arab world , the Palestinians and all the groups that make up the Palestine Liberation Organization ; experts on the various Maronite clans in Lebanon and on the Druses , Shiites and Sunni Moslems . So why ? The answer is that Washington and Jerusalem relied on their intelligence services .

With a green light from the Reagan Administration , Israeli troops invaded Lebanon . The Israeli intelligence services informed the Israeli Army that the Maronites could be counted on , that Syria would be no trouble , that the Soviet Union would be no trouble , that the Palestinians would be no trouble , that the Druses , Shiites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never know if Washington believed this shit . All we simple mortals know is that as long as Soviet weapons were used against American weapons with-. out a single Soviet or American soldier getting hurt , why should n't Washington believe it ? There is an old Jewish joke about two Polish barons . " If you do n't stop hitting my Jew , " one baron says , " I 'll hit your Jew . " In the June 1967 war , Soviet weapons proved inferior to American weapons . By the time of the October 1973 war , the Russians ' weapons were superior to the Americans ' . In June 1982 in Lebanon , Soviet weapons were inferior again . In the next war it will be the American weapons ' turn . That 's why there will be a next war . ? One is inclined to give the Washington experts the benefit of the doubt . Maybe they are not stupid . Maybe they are totally cynical . Maybe they believe that the United States should fight the Soviet Union until the last Israeli , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunni has been killed . Israel has learned nothing from its horrible , senseless war . Begin 's successors are creating a situation in which another war is inevitable . Israel still believes in a military solution to the Palestinian problem . It hopes that the United States will give it the role of keeping order in the Middle East . ' Dog eat dog , while the masters watch . Nineteen eighty-four will not be a very good year . ?
