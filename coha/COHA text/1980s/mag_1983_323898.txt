Harassment charges leave the Crimson crimson <P> It was a classic case of misused professorial power . Soon after winning a spot on the Harvard faculty in 1981 , a woman Ph.D . became the target of amorous advances by her committee chairman . She claims that he invited her to his home when his wife and children were away and , at a party for Latin American dignitaries , introduced her as " my slave . " The woman consulted the dean 's office but was repeatedly discouraged from making a formal complaint . <P> The advances continued , accompanied by what the woman claims were veiled threats to jeopardize her career . She eventually complained to Henry Rosovsky , dean of the faculty of arts and sciences , who found that the case had merit . Rosovsky wrote her a letter stating , " The repeated sexual advances and certain other deprecating actions constituted a serious abuse of authority . " In an August out-of-court settlement , Harvard stripped Professor Jorge Dominguez of his committee powers but did not suspend him . The woman 's contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin America . <P> The case may be extreme , but it is not an isolated one . Last month Harvard released a comprehensive survey on sexual harassment , based on questionnaires sent to all arts-and-sciences faculty members , 1,000 graduate students and 2,000 undergraduates , both male and female . Some 34% of female undergraduates ( and a smattering of males ) , 41% of female graduate students and 49% of nontenured women faculty reported experiencing some form of harassment , ranging from verbal abuse to assault. * The occurrences and the concern they raised tended to increase as women had higher seniority and tenure at stake . The 164-page report concluded , " Clearly the Harvard experience is different for men and women . Women experience an atmosphere that is more hostile and threatening . " <P> What constitutes sexual harassment ? <P> Certain acts , such as unwanted sexual invitations , unwelcome physical contact or pressure for dates , are obvious . Men tend to define harassment almost solely in terms of sex . But the survey showed that only 2% of untenured women and 1% of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or attempted rape . Women , however , considered as serious harassment demeaning remarks and behavior designed to make them feel uncomfortable . <P> Although 15% of Harvard 's untenured women and 9% of female undergraduates reported that they had mentioned problems to a university official , only a few made formal complaints because they feared reprisals . " I think men can often band together when one of them is threatened , " wrote one woman graduate student in answer to the questionnaire . " The uniquely powerful position they hold over people just starting careers makes me hesitant about ever reporting sexual harassment . " Says Holly Ladd , a lawyer for one woman complainant : " What we have here is gender harassment . We 're not necessarily talking about sex in the sense of one person 's trying to be physical with another . We are talking about an unwillingness on Harvard 's part to do anything about a hostile and intimidating atmosphere for women . "
