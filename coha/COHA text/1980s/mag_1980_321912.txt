For use on election nights , Pierre Trudeau usually has an apt quote in his pocket from the popular homily Desiderata ( " Go placidly among the noise and haste " ) . But for his moment of triumph last week he borrowed from Robert Frost . As the cheers welled around him , the once and future Prune Minister quoted from Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening : " I have promises to keep , and miles to go before I sleep . " <P> Only last December , Trudeau had decided to retire from politics and keep a personal promise to his three boys , Justin , 8 , Sacha , 6 , and Michel , 4 , to move from Ottawa to Montreal . " I wanted to have some time , before I become too decrepit , for leading a personal life and seeing my kids grow up , " he explained , after announcing his intention to step down as leader of the Liberal Party . " And for three weeks , " he added , " I 'd begun enjoying my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job offers , including an $80,000-a-year lectureship in the U.S. And though his estranged wife Margaret , 31 , had bought a house in Ottawa and looked after the children during the campaign , friends say that there is almost no chance of a reconciliation . <P> Then came the unexpected fall of Joe Clark 's Tory government . The Liberals had already set a date for a leadership convention in March , but rather than cobble together a hurried convention to choose a new leader , the party caucus and national executive decided that they would be better off drafting Trudeau . Some viewed his decision to quit the leadership as only a feint designed to lull the Tories into a false sense of security . But one friend insists that " he very genuinely was out , and only with very great difficulty made up his mind to come back . " <P> In announcing his decision to run again , Trudeau explained : " My duty is to accept the draft of my party . That duty was even stronger than my desire to re-enter private life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understandable desire not to go into history as a loser but to seek vindication for last May 's defeat . <P> Now 60 , Trudeau still cuts a trim , athletic figure , bounding up the marble steps to his office in the Parliament buildings or skating with his boys on the Rideau Canal ( though younger members of his staff have taken to referring to him - in private , anyway-as " the old man " ) . While there was no rekindling of the flames of " Trudeaumania " during the campaign , he racked up an impressive personal victory in his home district of Mount Royal in Montreal . He won a total of nearly 36,000 , or 82% of the vote . Even before election day , his hapless Tory opponent , Harry Bloomfield , conceded : " Trudeau is brilliant and incredibly attractive . I do n't expect to win . I 'm not nuts . " <P> Having led his party to power for the fourth time , Trudeau also reclaims his title as the elder statesman among Western leaders . He is expected to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tackling the country 's domestic problems . In accepting his party 's bid , Trudeau did make one provision : he will step down well before the next election-meaning in two to three years , or as Trudeau put it , after " I change the flow of things . "
