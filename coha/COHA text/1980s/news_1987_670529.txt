At the same time on a street out back , a Government truck pulled up and delivered 30 small crates of strawberries - some ripe , some overripe , some moldy - at $2. 40 a pound . A scolding saleswoman shoveled them into the bags of customers who had formed a 15-minute line. // The strawberry scene spoke eloquently of the bizarre anomalies of the Soviet pricing system and its byproducts : unreasonably high or low prices and long lines for products whose quality is uneven at best . <> <> Complex of Controls and Subsidies // The rigid pricing system is a complex fabric of Government controls and subsidies with isolated patches of quasi-free market economies , including farm markets that sell produce from private plots. // It is this system that Mikhail S. Gorbachev is proposing to alter with his program , newly endorsed by the Communist Party , to gradually introduce price flexibility in the Soviet economy. // Inherent in the issue of prices , according to Western and Soviet analysts , are the key difficulties that face most of Mr. Gorbachev ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // * Reining in a powerful bureaucracy , in this case the State Committee for Prices , known by the acronym Goskomtsen .

Food price increases in Eastern Europe have sometimes touched off protest and political instability . <> <> ' Jumping Out Into the Unknown ' // A Western diplomat predicted last week that conservatives would call the pricing innovations a threat to the basic order of Communism . The current system , he said , is a known quantity , but Mr. Gorbachev ' s proposals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new pricing policies , like most of the sweeping changes , have not been worked out in enough detail to be made law during a session next week of the Supreme Soviet , the nominal Parliament. // The one economic law the Supreme Soviet is expected to enact will allow the state ' s enterprises greater freedom to manage their own affairs , chose their managers and offer bonuses to their workers. // How fast and how far Mr. Gorbachev will jump on the price issue is still under discussion , according to Abel G. Aganbegyan , the economist who was selected to explain Mr. Gorbachev ' s new proposals at a news conference. // Mr. Aganbegyan explained that the alternatives under discussion were either a stage-by-stage shift in the present pricing mechanisms , with the first stage affecting only wholesale prices , or an overall re-examination of wholesale , retail and agricultural prices , with no changes before 1990 . <> <> Instrument of Efficiency // The guidelines for Mr. Gorbachev ' s economic changes , approved Friday by the Communist Party ' s Central Committee , said prices should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of social production , for developing economic management methods and for deepening cost-accounting and self-financing.

But there was little incentive to keep costs down because of widely available subsidies. // In contrast , retail prices were supposed to be set at a level that would guarantee a balance between supply and demand . This was a goal that was largely unmet , judging by the periodic shortages of everything from fruit to furniture. // Prices were also used to insure that some products were accessible to low-paid workers .

But buyers often have to wait in line for meat that is of low quality , if available at all . In farmers ' markets , it is likely available but higher priced. $115 Billion in Subsidies According to Mr. Gorbachev ' s speech Thursday , the Soviet economy spends 72 billion rubles a year ( more than $115 billion ) in subsidies . More than 50 billion rubles of this goes to agriculture. // The farm subsidy has increased 150 percent in the last 10 years , and is now more than 12 times the 1966 level of four billion rubles , according to articles in the Soviet press. // " What is happening ? " asked a professor of economics , R. Khasbulatov , writing in Komsomolskaya Pravda . " Agricultural productivity is virtually at a standstill " and the inefficiency is forcing up subsidies. // He said such subsidies were paid for in part by inflated prices on goods like imported jeans ( marked up sevenfold ) and similar products. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or $310 . Even with subsidies , about 30 percent of the total is spent on food , according to a 1985 survey - compared with 19 percent by American families , economists said . <> <> Risks of Social Unrest // To increase the prices of bread and meat , for example , which have changed little in decades , without increasing salaries is to ask for social unrest . In Poland in 1976 , an increase in food prices was canceled after widespread protests , strikes and , in one city , riots. // But to increase salaries means increased prices for the goods the workers produce - and the essential elements for inflation are then present. // What about inflation ? The word did not appear in the discussion of prices in the Central Committee blueprint . The most it would caution was : " It is necessary . . . to overcome the tendency toward the growth of prices on the basis of the development of the competitive power of enterprises. " // This was a prescription for letting competition achieve price cuts. //   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
