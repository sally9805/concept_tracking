PAPER BACK By Sanford J. Ungar his is a terrible psychological shock for all of us , " said Rita Klimova when I reached her by phone in Prague a few nights ago . " We do n't know how to adjust . " Klimova ? the daughter of a famous Czech Communist editor who fell into disgrace after the 1968 Soviet invasion , the ex-wile of a close adviser to Alexander Dubi.ek who has long since gone into exile in Vienna , and herself a professor Of political economy banished from the faculty of Charles University ? has lived a dissident 's life for two decades . Fluent in English . she worked quietly as a translator and interpreter until she reached retirement age and qualified for a state pension . Then she had more time for some pet projects . including an underground journal she helped launch two years ago . That journal , Lidove , Vovinv ( People 's Newspaper ) , suddenly became legal at the end of November , as the embattled Communist government caved in to many of the demands of Civic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transform Czechoslovakia Into a liberal democracy . Lam. . iny is among the few publications that have any crcti. , lilts ' as an alternative 10 the disgraced Rude Pram , the official Communist Party daily . But the transition will not he easy . As theperson in charge of Civic Forum 's press center for foreign journalists , Klimova has been inundated in recent weeks , but it is the sudden success and uncertain future of Lidove Noviny that preoccupies her . Under circumstances that are not exactly conducive to clear , careful thought , she says , " we have to decide what we are going to be . " I was there one Thursday evening during the spring of 1988 when a group of six dissidents gathered in Klimova 's small apartment in an old bourgeois neighborhood of Prague . Ranging in age from 22 to 63. they constituted most of the paper 's editorial board . Klimova put out a modest dinner , including a single small tomato . " It was expensive , but it looked so good , I could n't resist it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine , beer , and becherovka , the bitter herbal liqueur that is known as " the 13th spring of Carlsbad " and is used to celebrate special occasions . The name Lidove Novinv is important in Czechoslovakia 's turbulent history . Founded in 1891 to advance the interests of a liberal political party , it soon became a newspaper of the intelligentsia ( like Le Monde in a later era in France ) , advocating Tomas Masarvk 's dream of carving an independent country out of the Czech lands ( Bohemia and Moravia ) and Slovakia as the Austro-Hungarian empire crumbled . Once that dream was realized , the paper enjoyed its heyday , explained Jiri RumI , the senior member of the group , who was serving as editor in chief and a publisher of sorts . " Between the wars , " he said , " it was considered to be very objective . very high-brow , and stylistically very good . " Although some members of the staff died in concentration camps during World War 11 , others collaborated with the Nazis and continued publishing the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . " But in 1949 , " said Ruml , a once well-known journalist who went through his own Stalinist phase , " the Communist Party leadership decided that if they were to work more closely with the intellectuals , especially the skeptics , it would be a good idea to resume publication of Wove Noviny . They named an editor from the regime . By 1952. however , it no longer seemed necessary to persuade anyone to work with the Party . They shut down the paper altogether . So the last real issue of Lidove Novinv was published more than 35 years ago . " There was an attempt to revive the paper in 1968. after a number of writers previously expelled from the Party were reinstated and censorship was temporarily abolished . According to Ruml , who was involved in that effort , they had bought a press and were supposed to begin publishing as an evening paper on September 1 . But the tanks came in August , and Lidove , ' ovine was banned before it ever reappeared . Ruml was expelled from the Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a crane operator until he too became eligible to retire with a pension a few years ago . Ruud and his friends did n't try again until the fall of 1987 . They believed that after ten years Charter 77 had become like a closed society . A document was issued . said Ruml , that called on people to " wake the nation up into freedom . " " We thought this would be something that ordinary people would not be afraid of . Also , we chose a time that was difficult for the authorities : there was a change in the leadership in Czechoslovakia and great uncertainty about how things would develop in the Soviet Union . " They started as a monthly , planning to become a weekly within two years if the political climate permitted . " Our aim , at every stage , is to provide information about things the official media ignore or lie about . " The project soon ran into problems . Without a sponsor that was a member of the National Front , which was supposed to unite all official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in their affirmation of the leading role of the Communist Party , the paper could not be legally registered and sold . If it was sold unofficially , the staff risked being charged with conducting an " unpermitted enterprise , " the same accusation that destroyed the Jazz Section of the Musicians ' Union . When the first two pilot issues of Lidove Noviny were published , in November and December 1987 , on both occasions Ruml was arrested and all of the copies were confiscated . Or so the police thought . In fact , only a small percentage of the copies had actually been seized . Anticipating just such problems , the staff had compartmentalized itself . Ruml was protected from knowing how and where the paper was produced . The people in charge of production had no idea who was writing for each issue or what they planned to say . This made internal communication difficult , but helped outsmart the authorities . " We never use the telephone to talk about what we are doing , and we always check to see if the police are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We have to assume that everything we are saying here tonight is being heard . " Still , the new Lidove Noviny went from being produced on manual typewriters with carbon paper to sophisticated graphics and political cartoons ; photocopies began turning up in government offices and on the Prague Metro . By last month ( issue No. 21 ) , Lidove Noviny looked like a thick , stapled newsletter , with 28 pages of biting , sometimes satirical commentary on domestic and international politics , economics , culture , and ecology . It has done its best to irritate the government . For example , in the spring of 1988 , when the official Party newspaper in Slovakia began , but then suspended , publication of excerpts from the autobiography of Vasil Bilak , the detested hard-liner then in charge of ideology on the Party 's Central Committee , Lidove Noviny obtained Bilak 's manuscript and published the missing parts . Before long , the editorial board estimated , as many as 4,000 copies of each issue were circulating across the country . " But let 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board , " the police can , at any moment , wipe this thing out if they want to . We are functioning with a knife at our throats . " Meanwhile , the board operated as best its members could remember or imagine an editorial board should . It debated domestic economic issues and searched for the correct position toward the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank . The arguments , refreshing in a country where political opinions had been handed down from on high for 40 years , often became so heated that some members of the board threatened to resign if they did not prevail on certain issues . On the evening I was there , the discussion turned quickly to American politics and the Moscow summit meeting then about to occur between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev . " When Gorbachev came here lin April 1987 , we actually thought he might apologize for 19681 , " complained Jan Dobrovsky , a 28-year-old who had studied agricultural engineering at Charles University but had been expelled because of his father 's political views . " Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disillusioned . " That remark shattered the decorum and launched these seemingly reasonable intellectual companions on a startling ( and , given the fear that the room was hugged , reckless ) torrent of anti-Gorbachev , anti-Soviet , anti-Communist remarks : " Gorbachev 's popularity in the United States frightens us . Ca n't you see that he 's just bluffing ? Perestroika , however interesting it may be , is just another way to strengthen the dictatorship . " " Khrushchev talked a good line , too , but he went into Hungary in 1956 , and look how many thousands the Russians killed there . " " I am increasingly sympathetic to Reagan in recent months ; at least he 's not eating out of Gorbachev 's hand . On balance , I think that if I were American , I would vote for the Republicans this year . " " I like Margaret Thatcher , too . She knows how to talk to the Communists . " And so it went , until there was a sudden knock at the door . A look of panic crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who pulled his papers together and reached to close his briefcase . As an uneasy quiet descended upon the group , Klimova went to the door . But it was not the police . It was Jiri Dienstbier , one of the , journalistic heroes of 1968 who kept Radio Prague on the air and used it to report the truth about what was happening during the Soviet invasion . For years he had been required to work as a stoker , when he was not in prison , and he had become one of the most mischievously outspoken members of the dissident community . He had his own project at the time , launching an alternative international journal of foreign affairs , but he was also lending his moral support to the revival of Lidove Noviny . Dienstbier , a large , jolly man who always seems to have a bit otitis last meal caught in his mustache , argued that Lidove Noviny should not attempt to remain absolutely pure by refusing all cooperation with the government . He then left as unpredictably as he had arrived . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . Even as Poland and Hungary bubbled with change , the regime in Prague had successfully
