The latest reports from the nation ' s major airlines show their business continued to moderate in December , part of the reason for recent fare discounting . The year-to-year traffic-growth rate at the major airlines has been declining since July , and figures for the last three months of 1987 show the trend continuing . The industry measures traffic in revenue passenger miles  --  one paying passenger flown one mile . " There ' s no evidence of a sharp fall-off , but we ' re going to see slower rates of growth " in both the airline industry and the travel industry in general , said James V. Cammisa Jr. , publisher of Travel Industry Indicators , a Miami-based newsletter . Timothy Pettee , airline analyst at Bear , Stearns &; Co. , estimates industry traffic grew about 5% in December , down from increases of 7. 8% in November and 9. 8% in October . Mr. Pettee said the numbers shed light on the latest airline promotions  --  triple mileage programs for frequent fliers , and last week ' s fare cuts of as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( airlines ' ) bookings for the first quarter were not enough to avert an early round of fare discounts , " Mr. Pettee said . Last Friday , the United Airlines unit of Chicago-based Allegis Corp. said its December traffic fell 2. 3% , after gains of 1% in November and 4. 5% in October . United said its December results were hurt by " unusually bad weather " in Chicago and Denver , the carrier ' s two largest hubs . Also reporting Friday , Trans World Airlines said its December traffic rose 5% . Last week ' s traffic reports from other big carriers range from a decline of 12. 5% at Eastern Airlines to a gain of 49. 5% at Continental Airlines . Both are units of Houston-based Texas Air Corp . But such results can be skewed by special factors . Eastern , for example , has been shrinking its size , while Continental ' s gain largely reflects acquisitions . Adjusting for such factors , Mr. Pettee said , Continental ' s comparable December traffic gain is 9% . And at the American Airlines unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reported 10. 5% gain is cut to 5% when the acquisition of AirCal is factored in . While some industry executives and analysts fear that economic worries might curb travel plans , Mr. Pettee said it is too early to blame the results on a significant consumer slowdown . But he said the figures do indicate that last year ' s fare increases were starting to hurt . " The outlook is that fare aggressiveness is probably needed to sustain adequate levels of traffic growth , " he said . United said it flew 4. 91 billion revenue passenger miles in December , down from 5. 03 billion miles a year earlier . The decline came as United ' s domestic traffic fell 5. 9% , which was partly offset by a 20. 3% jump in its international traffic . United ' s December load factor , or the percentage of available seats filled , fell slightly to 59. 6% from 59. 9% . For the year , United said , its traffic rose 11. 9% to 66. 29 billion revenue passenger miles , and the load factor rose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TWA said its December traffic rose to 2. 35 billion revenue passenger miles from 2. 24 billion a year earlier . The load factor for the month fell to 57. 4% from 58. 6% . For the year , TWA ' s traffic rose 20% to 32. 86 billion revenue passenger miles . The load factor rose to 63. 4% from 58. 3% . Most of the major airlines reported their results last week . Figures from Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines and the Northwest Airlines unit of St. Paul , Minn. - based NWA Inc. are expected early this week .
