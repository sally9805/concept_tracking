Nagging crime , falling tourism and restive Hawaiians <P> " The loveliest fleet of islands that lies anchored in any ocean , " wrote Mark Twain about Hawaii in 1908 . Time has not altered that verdict . The palm trees still sway in the cool breezes , the Pacific surf still spills across powdery white beaches , and the scent of lei still perfumes the air . Yet amid its travel-brochure lushness , Hawaii is struggling to cope with a surge in crime , a slump in tourism and the social strains caused by two decades of rapid growth . Laments Honolulu Mayor Eileen Anderson : " We 've lost the feeling of ' Aloha ' for one another . " <P> The clearest sign of paradise lost is the state 's crime rate . Between 1976 and 1980 , murders climbed 53% , rape 61% and robbery 55% . Among 18 U.S. cities with a population of 500,000 to 1 million , Honolulu ranked fifth in larceny and ninth in car thefts last year . State officials last week reported that crime was down 8.1% for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period in 1980 , but the dip hardly dents the growth of the problem in recent years . Admits Deputy Chief of Police Harold Falk Jr. : " Honolulu is no longer some isolated South Sea paradise . We suffer the same problems as big cities on the mainland . " <P> Though some 90% of the crimes in Hawaii are committed against permanent residents , it is the remaining 10%-those committed against tourists-that cause the biggest headlines . The trials of nine youths for the rape of a Finnish dental student in a park near Honolulu in 1979 attracted worldwide attention , as did the murder of a young California couple on a popular hiking trail on Kauai last March . Perhaps the most audacious crime of the past year occurred in early March , when a pair of armed teen-agers hijacked a busload of Japanese tourists at Honolulu airport and robbed them of $11,000 in cash and a stack of cameras and jewelry ; two suspects were arrested the same day . <P> Though the increase in theft and violence can not be pinned to any single cause , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gap between rich and poor . Among the most downtrodden : the Hawaiians and part-Hawaiians . Those descendants of the islands ' original Polynesian settlers make up less than 20% of the total population of 975,000 . ( Of the rest , 26% are Caucasian , 25% are of Japanese stock and the balance Filipino , Chinese and Korean , among other ethnic groups ) . Poorly educated and relegated for the most part to the lower rungs of the economic ladder , the Hawaiians and part-Hawaiians resent the immigrants , or malihinis , for dominating the political and commercial landscape of the lands that once belonged to them . Says Hawaiian Activist A. Leiomalama Solomon : " They do n't tell us to get to the back of the bus . They just make it more difficult for us to get on the bus . "
