Tired of last year 's tubular furniture ? Depressed by dreary drapes , bent blinds , avocado wallpaper and grease-stained cushions ? Embarrassed when splayed rattan furniture leaves your guests bleeding ? Yes , but you have neither the time nor patience to tackle the job ? <P> Well , there is help . Just make a quick phone call , and a compact van , stocked with thousands of solutions , will arrive at your door . A driver- decorator ( 98% are women ) will survey the immediate problems and analyze whether your inclinations are in the formal , casual , transitional or luxurious mode . Then , presto ! Out from the van can come decks of fabric swatches , wheels of paint chips , pages of wall coverings , rows of baked tiles , furniture catalogs  --  even lamps and statuary . For customers who like things fancy , there are silk screens , antique engravings , custom-framed landscapes and Old Master reproductions  --  a Degas for the master suite , perhaps , or a Bruegel for the bar . <P> Convoys of minivans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail of satisfied customers , mostly overworked yuppie couples , young mothers and small-business owners . Maryland-based Decorating Den has accelerated from 100 vans in 1984 to more than 600 franchised van drivers today . The Georgia-based TransDesigns , which sells its own product lines of rugs , drapes and fine-arts objects , has grown from 183 decorators in 1975 to 32,000 decorators and $31 million in retail sales last year . <P> " People need reassurance that what they want to do will work out , " says Patricia St. Hilaire-Croteau , 32 , a TransDesigns decorator in Connecticut . For a cost of about $500 , a face-lifting might include three custom-framed reproductions and four toss pillows . A full room overhaul , which includes several pieces of furniture , an area rug , window treatments and art , might run about $3,800 . <P> A stickler for detail , TransDesigns Decorator Joan Caruso-Zinicola packs her van with shadow boxes , even containing seashells to complete the " traditional look , " and raku pottery to be mounted on pedestals to " bring dead corners to life .

For $5,000 , Noonan finished the dining room with a new rug , a lambrequin over the windows and matching chair cushions , designed a sunny " Florida " solarium adjacent to the newly outfitted family room , and dramatized the guest bathroom with mauve , black and white accents . The Scalas are happy with the result . Says Joan : " I 'm saving money in that I count my time as valuable . "
