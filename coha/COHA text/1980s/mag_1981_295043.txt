Interior 's Watt : determined , righteous and on the move <P> Any number of fierce advocates surround Ronald Reagan these days , all determined to carry out last November 's election mandate . Each seems , however , to interpret the mandate as his very own , as an individual summons to overhaul his special part of the System . No one is more zealous than James Watt , 43 , the lanky , brusque Secretary of the Interior . His soft voice and thick glasses make him seem a little like a benign mortician , but that could be misleading . For Jim Watt has all the self-righteous conviction of the born-again Christian that he is , and his goal is no less ambitious than converting America 's soul about harvesting its vast natural resources . <P> In a way , Watt represents Reaganism in all its extremes : the single-mindedness , the bluster , the aching for a glorious past . His whole aggressive demeanor , his background as head of the Mountain States Legal Foundation , which thwarted environmental regulations , have convinced some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasures from the people and turn them over to powerful industrial interests . Since more than a few conservation activists are every bit as determined and self-righteous as Watt , that could prove a dangerous mission . <P> Of course , that was precisely why he was picked for the job . After Nevada Senator Paul Laxalt called Watt to his office and sized him up , he excitedly phoned the President-who had never set eyes on the keen lawyer-and said he had found just the right man . Watt was razor smart , Laxalt told the President , a steely manager who knew his field . Best of all , Laxalt declared , Watt could take pressure : he had the hide of a rhino . <P> In two short months the thick-skinned man who manages 550 million acres of public land has stunned environmentalists and lawmakers with the way he has decisively altered policymaking at Interior . Watt has accelerated the sale of oil and gas leases , moved to expedite the surface mining of coal , opened up wilderness areas to allow exploration of strategic minerals , halted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he wants a bold , sensible program that will renew the country 's growth . Says one of Watt 's top aides , Stan Hulett : " Nobody could have survived making these proposals a few years ago . It took a major economic crisis to let us finally change direction . " <P> The environmentalists have roared back , warning of ecological nightmares . " This is the first time in my memory , " says former Senator Gaylord Nelson , who now lobbies for the Wilderness Society , " that the country 's chief conservation officer has been an antienvironmentalist . " <P> Watt is an autocratic and cocksure man who is quick to show his impatience with poor performance . Wary colleagues sensed long ago not to swear in his presence . He neither smokes nor drinks-no coffee either . His unbending sense of propriety is so well known that , although Watt claims he never uttered a word about it , rumors swept the Interior building that women workers should wear skirts , not slacks , on the job .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
