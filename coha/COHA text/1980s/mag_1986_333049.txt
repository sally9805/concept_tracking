The Mafia 's tradition of omerta , the code of silence , is explicit : betray the family and pay with your life . But beginning with the televised confessions of Cosa Nostra Songbird Joseph Valachi in 1963 , that code has been repeatedly violated . At the racketeering trial of reputed Mafia Boss John Gotti last week in Brooklyn federal court , omerta suffered one of its rudest shocks yet . <P> Federal Judge Eugene Nickerson disclosed that a trusted member of Gotti 's Gambino crime family had secretly taped conversations between the capo and his confederates over a 30-month period . The informant , a self-styled former hit man named Dominick Lofaro , was brazen enough to carry a concealed wire right into Gotti 's lair , the Bergen Hunt and Fish Club in Ozone Park , N.Y . His cooperation with authorities marked the first time that a Mafia " soldier " had ever worked as an informant while on active duty . The intelligence coup , said one New York City police officer , was " like penetrating the Kremlin . " <P> Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gotti 's ambition to broaden the Gambino family business . Over the objections of former Gambino Boss Paul Castellano , who was gunned down on a crowded Manhattan street last December , authorities say , Gotti urged cronies like Lofaro to get more involved in drug trafficking . Then in 1984 Lofaro was arrested in upstate New York while attempting to sell a kilogram of heroin to an undercover detective . <P> Faced with a long prison stretch , Lofaro decided to turn informant . His arrest was kept secret to prevent his associates from suspecting him , and he was able to return to his New York City haunts without being searched for the hidden wire . From 1984 until last March , Lofaro made more than 50 tapes that include conversations between Gotti and his lieutenants . The tapes , said Assistant U.S. Attorney Diane Giacalone , provide " direct evidence of John Gotti 's role as manager of the gambling enterprise " of the Gambino crime family . <P> Although Giacalone had notified the court of the Lofaro tapes in July , their existence was kept secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in undercover work . Gotti 's attorney , Bruce Cutler , called the last-minute disclosure " outrageous , " insisting that the evidence should have been shown to defense attorneys months ago . " There has been a constant attempt by the Government to try Mr. Gotti by ambush , " said Cutler . " They are not going to succeed . " Nevertheless , the Government obviously hopes the tapes will prove that the most damaging witness against Gotti is the boss himself .
