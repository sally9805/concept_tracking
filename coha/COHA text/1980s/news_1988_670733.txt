In the teachers ' view , the simplification is needed because students spend too many hours memorizing the rules of spelling when those hours might be devoted to studying math or science to help France keep up with West Germany , Japan and the United States. // But French literary figures have treated the proposal , which would include removing many circumflex accents , as an assault on the ramparts of linguistic purity . " It would be a disaster , " said the novelist Francoise Sagan . " French is a superb language with Greek and Latin roots that should not be debased . It would be extraordinary folly and stupidity. " // " It ' s none of their business to change the rules of spelling , " said Jean Dutourd , an author and member of the French Academy , the venerable institute of writers that since 1635 has sought to insure proper French grammar and spelling . " Their business is to teach . The French language has worked spendidly for 400 years . Why do they want to change it now ?

" Keeping French spelling straight may be hard for our students , but it is even harder for foreigners.

" // In past centuries , only a small number of French students reached high school , and with backgrounds in Latin , the students absorbed spelling more readily than today . Spelling has become a problem , teachers say , because today everyone reaches high school and students spend more time watching television than learning Latin. // Schoolteachers say one reason that change is needed is that the tens of millions of people in Central and North Africa who learn French have a hard time with French spelling because their native languages do not have Greek or Latin roots. // The teachers , many of them left-leaning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for separating the classes .

" <> <> As Usual , It ' s Political // As is so often the case in France , the dispute has become a political issue dividing left and right . The teachers , many of them Socialists , are the main force for change , while conservatives have swiftly reacted against it. // Le Figaro , the right-leaning daily newspaper , ran a story lambasting the proposals for simplifying the language , quoting members of the French Academy as saying such changes would " massacre " their beloved French. // But Le Monde , a left-of-center daily , said phasing out several dozen illogical spellings " would be a benefit for everyone .

In 1953 , officials from French-speaking countries at the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization called unanimously for a simplification of French . In 1960 , members of the French Academy of Sciences called for changes in " complications that are contrary to good sense , " but that appeal was to no avail . <> <> The Specter of the Dictee // Critics of change talk as if the nation would be thrown into anarchy because schoolchildren might learn to spell words one way while their parents continued to spell them another. // The French do not seem capable of taking the spelling dispute lightly in part because so many of them lost so much sleep over spelling when they were young .

" // But not wanting to stir a storm , he has decided not to name a commission of deep thinkers to study the scheme. // " French is an essential part of our cultural patrimony , " Mr. Jospin said , echoing the stalwarts of the French Academy .
