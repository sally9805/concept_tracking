JERUSALEM  --  Ilan Pekker , an astrologist here with his own radio show and newspaper column , claims it ' s written in the stars that Israel ' s coalition government may collapse any day . But the forecast is different on the ground . With surprising consensus , Israel ' s more conventional political sages expect the country ' s two-year-old , crisis-ridden government to survive a year or more with Yitzhak Shamir as its new prime minister . Mr. Shamir , 70 years old and currently the foreign minister , changes jobs next week with Prime Minister Shimon Peres , 63 , who officially resigns today . The change is dictated by a power-sharing agreement struck between Mr. Shamir ' s right-wing Likud bloc and Mr. Peres ' s more moderate Labor Party in September 1984 after neither side could muster a ruling majority in national elections . It ' s risky to predict the longevity of Israel ' s volatile coalition government ; even a personality clash could break it up . Few expected it to last this long . But political forces at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forecast a quiet  --  even dull  --  first year under Mr. Shamir . The two explosive issues certain to trigger a split between Labor and Likud  --  new Jewish settlements on occupied land and an international peace conference  --  have been defused for the moment . And even though Mr. Shamir is vulnerable inside his own conservative Likud Party , his chief competitors , David Levy and Ariel Sharon , are expected to wait a respectable period of perhaps a year before making any power plays . Perhaps most important , there is a deterrent to either side ' s breaking up the government and calling for a new election right now . First , the coalition government is popular ; it got most of Israel ' s troops out of Lebanon and tamed hyperinflation . Voters might punish any party that invites instability by breaking up a good thing . Also , new elections likely would be just as indecisive as those in July 1984 , when neither of the two major parties won a majority of parliamentary seats and neither could get 61 of parliament ' s 120 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that Israel is as split as ever . " The ongoing consensus is that if new elections were held , there wouldn ' t be much change , " says Hanoch Smith , a leading Israeli pollster . " There might be some increase for Labor , but I think Labor ' s own conception is it wouldn ' t be enough incentive to hold new elections . " To the outside world , the pace Mr. Shamir will set as prime minister may seem dull in contrast to that of the activist , globe-trotting Mr. Peres . As foreign minister , Mr. Peres will continue his ways , but without the same clout . Mr. Shamir is a quiet and withdrawn former Mossad intelligence agent who didn ' t make a splash the last time he was prime minister , from October 1983 until September 1984 . " Right now we have a flying prime minister . Shamir will stick more at home , " says Mordechai Zipori , a longtime Likud politician . But leadership style won ' t be the only change . Just as Mr. Peres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to make the most of the flexibility in the power-sharing rules of the coalition government to mold Israel ' s foreign policy more in his own image . He and Mr. Peres are most different when it comes to negotiating with Arabs over the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip . Unlike Mr. Peres , Mr. Shamir isn ' t willing to give up territory captured by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War . While Mr. Peres as prime minister made breakthroughs by meeting with the leaders of Egypt and Morocco , Mr. Shamir ' s legacy more likely will be to help put more Jewish settlers in the occupied territories . But to avoid a fight with Labor , Mr. Shamir already has signaled that he won ' t push for more new settlements than authorized under the coalition agreement ; the agreement calls for building , at most , 26 new settlements and finishing those authorized by previous governments . But Mr. Shamir hopes to build up the Jewish communities that exist in the occupied territories . Such a strategy " closes up options " on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hebrew University . The one issue most capable of breaking up the government at any time is the question of an international peace conference . Mr. Peres has said he favors the concept ; Mr. Shamir opposes it . For now , it doesn ' t look as if Jordan is ready to go to an international conference , either . But the chances may improve as time goes on and Jordan finds new Palestinian partners for peace talks . The U.S. could make an international peace conference more of a possibility if it were to launch a new peace initiative , as some Washington analysts think it might later this year . By the time Mr. Shamir ' s second year as prime minister comes around , he also will have to face up to hard economic decisions to keep Israel ' s inflation rate down . Up to now , the economy has been a bipartisan issue . But as Likud and Labor get closer to elections , which are scheduled for September 1988 , the economic issue could be politicized . Mr. Shamir could take the blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
