To the boiling debate on Capitol Hill over how many dollars the Pentagon should get in forthcoming budgets , a second controversy is being added : whether the Defense Department can be trusted to spend wisely the funds Congress does allot . Outside critics have long accused the military services of misleading , inefficient practices that cause huge cost overruns and long delays in delivery of weapons . Now similar criticisms are coming from within the Pentagon , and Defense officials have been unable to hush them up . <P> The latest blast comes from a team led by five retired Air Force generals a sked last year by Air Force Secretary Verne Orr to study that service 's procurement policies . The report has not been released , but the findings have been leaked . <P> The generals assert that " if we continue to do business as usual , " the Air Force will be unable to buy as many planes and missiles as it plans even if Congress votes every penny President Reagan requests . Costs of major weapons systems , the generals found , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounted for by simple price inflation . For example , they estimate that B-1 bombers will cost $285 million each , vs . Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger 's current figure of $200 million . Also , they said , " the current development time for major Air Force weapons systems is averaging 11 years . " <P> The Air Force , say the generals , often grossly underestimates the cost of weapons , orders more than it can pay for , then juggles the production programs in a manner that plays hob with efficiency . Also , it has a habit of " entering full-scale development with immature " technology . Their conclusion : the Air Force should cancel some weapons-buying programs and concentrate on those it considers top priority . <P> The report confirms the findings of two previous , still suppressed studies by Pentagon Analysts Franklin Spinney and Milton Margolis that accuse the Army and Navy of many of the same inefficiencies . Influential Congressmen are demanding that both Spinney and Margolis testify before them . Asked last week if he would let Spinney appear , Weinberger replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield , particularly since copies of the Air Force generals ' report have reached enough Congressmen to ensure a loud debate .
