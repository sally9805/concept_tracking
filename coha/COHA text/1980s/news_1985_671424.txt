Half the party shows up at Bookbinder ' s Seafood House on 15th Street , where the fourth generation of the founding Bookbinder family holds court in a homey establishment with red tablecloths and bare wood floors that once was a police station . Time passes . The other diners don ' t appear . The party is getting antsy. // Finally , the telephone rings . It is the cashier at the Old Original Bookbinder ' s Restaurant across town - the other Bookbinder ' s , the bigger , flashier place that has evolved from the oyster bar founded near the waterfront by one Samuel Bookbinder in the Gay Nineties . The rest of the party has turned up there . Negotiations ensue , and sometimes the party divides angrily . Sometimes it reunites at one place or the other. // Which is the real Bookbinder ' s ? Each claims the title , one because the founding family runs it , the other on the ground that although the Bookbinder family is no longer there , it is nevertheless the original building , the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popped up freshly this week as the 15th Street Bookbinder ' s celebrates its 50th anniversary with champagne and speeches and 1935 prices ( half a dozen clams or oysters for 30 cents ) . Mayor W. Wilson Goode , in a citation praising 15th Street Bookbinder ' s as a city institution , attempted to answer the question by calling it " an offspring of the original restaurant. " // Despite the confusion , even among Philadelphians , the rivalry of an earlier generation of operators has apparently given way to friendly cooperation . They almost have to cooperate in self-preservation , given the intensely competitive explosion of eating places that in the last 10 to 15 years has earned Philadelphia a reputation as an exciting restaurant town. // They still can ' t resist a few mutual zingers , though . " I tell people that ' s our farm system , " a grinning Albert Taxin , the operator of Old Original Bookbinder ' s , says of his rival on 15th Street , " and when they get good enough , we ' ll bring them up. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the other restaurant ' s contention that it was established in 1865 , he replies : " Truthfully , I think it ' s a lie . My great-grandfather was born in 1854 . He would have had to be 11 years old when he started the restaurant . He might have been smart , but not that smart. " // // The original Bookbinder ' s opened on Walnut Street near the Delaware River in the 1890 ' s . Richard Bookbinder , 45 , and his brother , Sam , 50 , are not sure why their great-grandfather , Samuel , came to Philadelphia from Amsterdam. // The family owned and operated the original restaurant on Walnut Street until 1935 , when the founder ' s grandson , also called Sam , quarreled with another member of the family , pulled out and moved to 15th Street . Eventually the original restaurant was given to Jewish charities. // Enter John Taxin , a prominent produce merchant who often frequented the original Bookbinder ' s and , according to his son , Albert , hated to see it slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion program that today has made Old Original Bookbinder ' s into what one reviewer recently described not so much a restaurant as an event. // Slick , opulent and in some ways elegant , the Old Original boasts a private dining room modeled after the room where the Declaration of Independence was signed . A lobster tank and oyster bar stretch along one long window . Photographs of visiting celebrities cover the walls . There is a bust of George Washington , along with one of John Taxin . The underlying motif is colonial Philadelphia. // // Some commentators consider all this a bit hokey , and a 1982 consumer survey by Philadelphia magazine found the Old Original Bookbinder ' s to be the most overrated restaurant in town , with the worst value and the worst service . Fodor ' s travel guide to Pennsylvania , without naming it outright , rates it a cut below the 15th Street establishment , which it describes as a " happy , bustling institution. " // Philadelphia magazine , however , last year rated the Old Original as one of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own 1982 survey , while not listing the 15th Street place among the winners. // Both restaurants have their backers and detractors , but many Philadelphians consider them equally good . The Old Original might well be able to justify its assertion that it is " known throughout our country and abroad . " Situated as it is in the heart of Philadelphia ' s historic area , it is considered by some a tourist attraction in its own right . The 15th Street place , by contrast , is less glitzy , with a solid local clientele augmented by a healthy infusion of outsiders. // Each restaurant essentially serves basic seafood , simply and healthfully prepared . To Sam and Richard Bookbinder on 15th Street , both restaurants are playing to strength at a time when seafood and chicken are gaining ascendancy over red meat. // For years the two Bookbinder places and several other restaurants were about the only game in town . With the recent proliferation of restaurants , Richard Bookbinder says , both seafood restaurants have benefited from a general rise in interest in dining out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of diminishing returns may be near. // The Bookbinders and Taxins ( John Taxin , at the age of 78 , has largely turned the restuarant over to Albert ) have many reasons to cooperate , not the least the fact that both were unionized years ago . Most of the new restaurants are nonunion . When the Taxins took a long strike last year , the Bookbinders supplied them with temporary employees. // John Taxin , says his son , used to gloat whenever he heard a complaint about the 15th Street place . " He ' s a competitive old man , " says Albert Taxin , whose own attitude is somewhat different. // " I wish them well , " he said , " because a knock on them is a knock on us.
