THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment SEVERAL weeks ago , before martial taw had been declared in Poland , a French opinion-polling organization managed to ask some six hundred Poles what sort of party they would vote into office if free elections were held in their country . The most successful party was a Christian Democratic Party , which got forty-three per cent of the hypothetical vote ; the next ones were a Socialist Party and a Liberal Party , with twenty per cent each ; the last was the Communist Party  --  the only party that has been permitted to exist in Poland since 1945 ? which received three per cent of the vote . Now those who have proved to he acceptable to only three per cent have , making use of the Polish Army and the " security forces " ( which , considering their actual role of extinguishing the law and brutalizing the population , might better be called the " insecurity forces " ) , attacked the dissatisfied ninety-seven per cent of their countrymen , and are attempting by means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other known form of repression to terrorize them into submission and obedience . In effect , the government has declared war on the nation . ( It openly refers to martial law as " a state of war . " ) Since the nation itself is the " subversive " force that the regime is battling , the regime has had to adopt the tactic of outlawing virtually all of daily life  --  of suspending the life of the country . In an incredibly detailed and exacting series of decrees , which , taken together , amount to a sort of Bill of Rights in reverse , the regime has either banned or disrupted , among other things , all publishing or broadcasting by citizens ; all public assembly , including sports events , plays , movies , and night clubs ( the one exception is religious services ) ; all unauthorized use of copying machines ; all distribution of printed materials ; all use of the telephone or telex ( both have been suspended ) ; all unauthorized travel from one town to another ( except over the Christmas holidays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and all education ( except for nurseries : the regime as yet expects no opposition from three-year-olds ) . At the same time , workers in certain industries must go to work during the day , for they risk the death penalty if they fail to ; must stay at home at night ( in obedience to a curfew ) ; and , in some cases that have been reported , must sign papers declaring that they will not oppose " Socialism , " on pain of immediate arrest . It is reported that tens of thousands of people have been arrested and imprisoned , but there is a sense in which the whole of Poland has been put in jail , with each Pole being trapped in the darkness and solitude imposed by government censorship , and with the country as a whole being cut off from the rest of the world by the travel restrictions El EV ) EI D VP D 1 ) and by one of the most thorough information blackouts that the world has recently seen . In these circumstances , a special obligation falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have the good fortune still to enjoy liberty Solidarity has been a Polish movement aimed at renewing the political life of Poland , but in its courage , its spontaneity , its freshness and exuberance , its nonviolence , its respect for and dependence on the ordinary person , its political and moral creativity , its openness , its trust , and its faith in the better side of human nature it has been a landmark of universal significance in the history of the development of liberty over the centuries . In spirit , anyone anywhere who loved liberty has had to belong to Solidarity . Now the Communist military junta in Poland has  --  for the moment , at least  --  smashed the organization of Solidarity and rounded up its leadership . But we on the outside who became spiritual members of the organization in the year and a half of its existence are still at large . When Hitler 's armies were poised to conquer France , Churchill offered to merge the French and English peoples into a single nation . The governments of free countries today can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a sense , can . Romuald Spasowski , the former Polish Ambassador to the United States , who defected to this country last week , urged in a moving statement , " Whatever the future will he , do n't be silent , Americans . To defend freedom is in your tradition . Show your solidarity , show your support and humanitarian assistance to those who are in such need at this hour . " We  --  everyone who lives in freedom  --  should take up this invitation . For every member of Solidarity who is jailed in Poland , ten should spring up here . While the Poles are in chains , we can show our support . While they are silenced , we can speak . ? ? Receptions PEOPLE have been doing a lot of 1 receiving in New York City lately . Here are some of the receptions we have attended : At the Whitney Museum , about nine hundred people turned out for the evening opening of a show called " Ceramic Sculpture : Six Artists . " On the fourth floor , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fragment of Western Civilization " and David Gilhooly 's " Tantric Frog Buddha Camping Out . " Then they repaired to a lower level for cocktails , pretzels , and potato chips . Strolling between a Calder and a Rosenquist , they said things like " You were at Randy 's last Saturday , " and " Wait until you hear about you know who , " and " Viola ! I have n't seen you since Venice ! " At Books &; Co. , on Madison Avenue at Seventy-fourth Street , about seventy-five people gathered early in the evening to sample wine and cheese and to examine a new , illustrated edition of " Moby Dick , " which has just been published by the University of California Press . Andrew Hoyem , a tall , blond man , who is the director of the Anion Press , in San Francisco , designed the Anion edition of the book , which was published in 1979 in a limited edition of two hundred and sixty-five copies . " The California edition actually constitutes the trade edition of our book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the illustrations , and from the outset we decided not to depict scenes from the narrative  --  just wood engravings of whales and whaling , and so forth  --  because we did n't want to interfere with the reader 's imagination . " At the City Gallery , on Columbus Circle , a couple of hundred people attended the late-afternoon opening of a show of paintings , graphics , and sculpture by members of the National Association of Women Artists . Wine and cheese were abundant , and we fell into conversation with a tall young man in bluejeans named John Shea , who was talking with a gray-haired woman in a rose dress named Elizabeth Horman . Mr. Shea is an actor , and he told us he had recently finished making a movie called " Missing , " whose cast also includes Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek . " It 's a true story , and I play Mrs. Norman 's son , " Mr. Shea said . " But Mrs. Horman and I did n't meet until a couple of weeks ago . " Mrs. Horman beamed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended a five-thirty reception marking the opening of an exhibition called " American Photographers and the National Parks . " On the third floor , we caught up with Robert Glenn Ketchum , the curator of the exhibition  --  it contains some of his awn photographs and he told us that he had begun planning such a show five years ago , and that the National Park Foundation had agreed to sponsor it . " Then the Transamerica Corporation stepped in to underwrite things , " he continued . " The exhibition was first shown in Oakland this spring , and it will travel through the country until 1983 . " The reception  --  a mammoth one  --  included wandering mimes , a string trio , a brass quartet , a jazz quintet , cocktails , ham with mustard sauce , jambalaya , black-eyed peas with cucumbers , corn relish , corn bread , and dill butter . At the French Institute/Alliance Frangaise , on East Sixtieth Street , about three hundred people assembled in the evening for a champagne reception previewing an exhibit called " French Menus-1757-1976 . " Jacqueline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained that the menus  --  nearly all of them originals  --  were from several private collections , and she escorted us through a ground-floor gallery , where we saw , among other things , a menu from a supper given on November 4 , 1757 , for Louis XV and Mme. de Pompadour . We also noticed an elaborately designed satirical menu from 1870 , which offered things like clieval a la mode , bisque Bismarck , bombes glaaes a la Krupp , and sardines antediluviennes . In the Board of Directors Room of the New York Stock Exchange , about a hundred people showed up for an informal reception and buffet luncheon that the N.Y.S.E . was giving for members of the press . Jo Anne Murphy , of the Exchange 's public-information department , greeted us at the door and told us that the room  --  a vast and ornate place , involving a lot of green and gold , and with a ceiling of stained glass had been used for board meet-ings since the building went up , in 1903 . While people helped themselves to cold cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went over to a corner and inspected an urn of reddish-brown Siberian jasper on a green malachite pedestal ( the whole thing about eight feet high ) , which had been given to the Exchange in 1903 by Czar Nicholas II . On a balcony adjoining the Hilton Room of the Waldorf , a hundred and seventeen regional representatives and district sales managers of Avon Products , Inc. , got together for a reception preceding a banquet that honored them for being the highest-selling Avon people in their areas . While a pianist played Gershwin , the representatives and sales managers talked shop , sipped champagne punch , and ate shish kebab and quiche . One of the sales managers johnna of Beacon , New York  --  told us that she had been with Avon for six years . We asked Mrs. Faiella whether she had had any unusual experiences while she was working for the company , and she said , " Well , once I went out to recruit a new representative , and when I arrived at her house  --  it was a trailer , really , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear . " At the Spaced Gallery of Architecture , on West Seventy-second Street , about a hundred and fifty people arrived around six to sip fruit punch , walk on tatami mats ( before entering the gallery , guests were asked to remove their shoes ) , and view a collection of wood-block prints from Kyoto , Japan . Judith York Newman , an architect , who runs the gallery in conjunction with her own studio , told us that she had picked up the prints on a recent trip to the Far East . " We do n't have much space for display here , but we do at least have one wall that 's sixty feet long , " she said . In the lobby of the General Assembly Building of the United Nations , about four hundred United Nations delegates and their guests took seats to listen to an evening concert by Lionel Hampton 's seventeen-piece band , together with the guest soloists Gerry Mulligan , Kai Winding , and Milt Hinton . Mr. Hampton is about to take his band abroad , and near the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file through the audience playing " When the Saints Go Marching In " ? Deane J. Kirkpatrick , the United States Ambassador to the United Nations , handed Mr. Hampton a plaque appointing him " Ambassador of Music to the World . " Afterward , the musicians and about a hundred guests gathered on the twelfth floor of the United States Mission to the United Nations , just across First Avenue , for a reception that included cocktails , crudites , and artichoke souffle . As people stood looking out over the United Nations buildings , parts of Queens , the Queensboro and Williamsburg Bridges , and lights sparkling on the East River , we spoke with Ambassador Kirkpatrick , and told her that we thought the concert had been a great idea . " The concert was a good idea , " Mrs. Kirkpatrick replied , with a smile , " What was great about this evening was Lionel Hampton . " The Return of Mr. S. OUR Mr. Stanley is back ?

He 's been lying low in the woods near the Montauk Point lighthouse , he told us , at one with the ocean waves , watching leaves grow , studying snowflakes , and chopping wood . What lured him hack to the city , he said , was hearing about the Executive Coach , which makes the New York-to-Boston and Boston-toNew York run daily in four hours each way , door to door . " If your doors happen to be the Essex House , on Central Park South , and the Marriott Hotel in Newton , which mine are not , " Mr. Stanley added . " But those are minor details . Here . There 's hope for us yet . " He took off , leaving us with this report : Have just spent best two-day vacation of past decade .
