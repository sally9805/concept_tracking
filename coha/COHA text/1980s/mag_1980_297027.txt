Debates in Tehran and Cleveland bring the campaign to a climax <P> Seldom has an American election headed into such a wildly unpredictable windup . <P> Suddenly , the years of campaign planning , the months of oratory , the endless procession of TV spots , handshaking tours , charge and countercharge seemed little more than an arduous overture to the possibility that Iran would decide to release the 52 American hostages , and to the reality of the face-to-face TV confrontation this week between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan . How the debates in Tehran and Cleveland are decided could fulfill the dreams of one candidate while shattering those of the other-or , possibly , result in inconclusive dithering . <P> Neither event has any solid precedent . <P> To be sure , world events , real or promised , such as the Suez war and Hungarian revolt in 1956 , and Henry Kissinger 's " Peace is at hand " statement in 1972 , have influenced voters on the eves of past an issue as the hostages been so totally under the control of a foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1976 are equally irrelevant to this week 's face-off . Those earlier debates occurred in series of four and three beginning early in September , giving the candidates ample time to polish their arguments between rounds and pound them home in later campaign appearances . This time Carter and Reagan have taken the gamble of facing each other just once , in full knowledge that any mistakes they make can not be repaired or retouched in the week remaining before the vote . <P> That the choice of who will govern the nation for four years may well depend on the acts of a hostile , often irrational Iranian government and the impression two carefully rehearsed politicians make in a fleeting 90 minutes of TV time is deeply disquieting . But in a sense the election has been building toward that kind of bizarre climax . For more than a year , two flawed candidates have been floundering toward the final showdown , each unable to give any but his most unquestioning supporters much reason to vote for him except dislike of his opponent . Carter has been dogged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years in office , Reagan by a reputation for right-wing extremism and simplistic thinking . Each at some point held a lead in the polls : Carter early in the year , Reagan immediately after the Republican Convention . Each was unable to hold his advantage . <P> The release of the hostages , both candidates ' camps agree , would give the President 's campaign a powerful boost . The Republicans would have to join in the national rejoicing . Says one Reagan adviser : " We would grit our teeth and say how delighted we are . "
