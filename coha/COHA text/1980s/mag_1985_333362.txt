Dusk had just fallen last Thursday over Newry , a predominantly Catholic town of 19,000 in County Down . More than 20 police officers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary ( R.U.C. ) were gathered in their station canteen on Cory Square . At precisely 6:32 p.m. , mortar shells soared over nearby houses and crashed through the roof of the wood-frame dining hall , part of the cramped Newry station house . Nine 50-lb. shells were fired from a distance of about 250 yds. ; one struck the canteen . The explosions were so powerful that many bodies were mutilated . The final toll : nine killed and 37 wounded , including 25 civilians . Among the dead were two young women constables and a man who had been on the force for only a month . <P> In phone calls to a local journalist an hour later , the outlawed Irish Republican Army called the attack " a well-planned operation " that " indicates our ability to strike when and where we decide . " Indeed , after a long period of relative calm in Ulster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in any other single episode since violence between Protestant and Catholic militants first erupted in 1969 . British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , who escaped an I.R.A . bombing attempt on her life last October at Brighton , in the south of England , called the attack " barbaric . " Echoing her sentiments , the Irish Republic 's Prime Minister , Garret FitzGerald , described the I.R.A . assault as " cruel and cynical " and pledged that Irish security forces would help hunt the attackers down . Police suspect that the killers may have slipped across the border into the republic , less than five miles from Newry . <P> The I.R.A . ' s use of homemade mortars is an old tactic , but one that had met with little success in the past . The Newry station had once before been a target , in 1980 , when shells missed the police post but injured 26 civilians near by . <P> The Newry operation  --  dubbed " Bloody Thursday " by the British press  --  began when two masked I.R.A . men hijacked a truck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flatbed and the vehicle was then driven into town and parked in a vacant lot close to the R.U.C . station . The nine metal tubes on the truck  --  each 6 ft. long and 6 in. in diameter  --  were linked by detonating wires , suggesting to police that they had been fired by timing devices . Despite the apparent sophistication of the weapon , not all the shells found their target . Some fell in front of the station . One hit an observation tower , showering shrapnel onto nearby homes . Said Chief Superintendent Bill Stewart : " It was luck on the part of the I.R.A . rather than accuracy that gave them their direct hits . " <P> Before the attack , officials had been convinced that the I.R.A . was on the wane . Despite the Brighton explosion , the organization had seemed to suffer one setback after another , starting with the September interception by the Irish navy of a trawler loaded with seven tons of arms and ammunition for the I.R.A .
