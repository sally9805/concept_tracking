MANOEUVRE Starting March , PBS <P> If war is hell , armies must be able to stand the heat , and that means intensive training . Every autumn the NATO alliance conducts full-scale field maneuvers in West Germany , which has the misfortune of being the front line between East and West . No one is hurt in these war games , except by accident , but they are not exactly fun either . Every effort is made to duplicate the real thing : actual forces clash by day and night , and umpires determine who would have killed whom . It is a natural subject for the cinema verite technique of Frederick Wiseman ( Canal Zone , Titicut Follies ) , and the only thing lacking in Manoeuvre is the smell of commingled sweat and exhaust . <P> Wiseman looked at the 1978 exercises , grandiloquently titled Operation Autumn Forge , through the eyes of an American infantry tank company . He flew with them from their base at Fort Polk , La. , attended the ceremonies welcoming them to Germany and then followed them into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pentagon should be happy with the result : American soldiers may have the foulest mouths in the world but , for the most part , they seem also to be intelligent and hardworking . <P> There are slow moments in Wiseman 's two hours , but that is probably the price for this kind of documentary , which allows people to be themselves . " I wish I was a soldier coming through here in World War II , " muses one man , ogling the local girls from his tank turret . " I 'll bet they got what they wanted . Probably did n't have to ask for it either . " At an early briefing , a commanding officer calmly sends his subordinates off to battle : " That 's my last word . Be professional , and let it all hang out . " A few days later , problems have arisen , and he is less amiable . " By God , " he says , " either you do it , or I 'll find a job for you in the tiddlywink factory . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talkin ' to hear my head rattle . " <P> The visitors have been told to be polite to their hosts , and there is one scene of high comedy in which a line of tanks is held up by a lone farmer with a shovel . " We 've got a population problem , " an officer blandly radios to headquarters . " There 's a German national up here who wo n't let us through . " <P> At the end of the games , the Americans from Louisiana have helped to turn back the aggressors . There is , however , still a dispute between two of the tank drivers and an umpire , who has disallowed one of their theoretical kills . If this was a real war , they complain , they would be dead . He retorts : " You mean to tell me if this was a real war , you 'd belivin ' ? " <P> - G.C.
