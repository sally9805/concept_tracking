ueen of the mini- series ? " asks Jane Seymour , and she smiles tiny perfect rows of white . " Well , it 's nice to be queen of something ! " Jane Seymour 's claim to the mythical crown appears secure . In addition to ABC 's War and Remembrance , concluding its 30 hours in May , Seymour 's queenly bio for the past year includes the role of a flame-haired Victorian artist in CBS ' Jack the Ripper and her portrayal of Maria Callas in ABC 's The Richest Man in the World . For that role she won the Em-my for outstanding supporting actress in a miniseries special . " I was quite astounded to hear about the nomination for Callas , " the notso-plain Jane Seymour says in her lilting English accent . " I thought I might be nominated for my part as the Duchess of Windsor in the series The Woman He Loved . " Seymour , sitting high on her throne , her Emmy as her scepter , is a great defender of the miniseries . " I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says . " They offer the chance to present to the vast public book adaptations that they would never otherwise know . I also think they encourage people to read and reread the classics . " Seymour scorns reminders that her huge successes on the tube outstrip the successes of her big-screen movies . " Most feature films today are for 17-year-olds , prizefighters , and vigilantes , " she says in swiftresponse . " The best roles are in television . " Yet she turned down the biggest role of her career in War and Remembrance four times . " I was not prepared to go away from my husband and newborn baby for filming nine months in Eastern Europe , " she says . " Then I read the script  --  and cried through the whole night . I could n't put it down . I was obsessed with it . Finally my husband turned to me while I was reading  --  the pages were soggy and wet  --  and said , ' As a family we 'll have to figure some way to do this . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filming . " Yet the grueling months on location in Eastern Europe filming War and Remembrance were more than Seymour had counted on : " It was exhausting , horrendous , and depressing immersing yourself in those terrible times . " Seymour sighs and smooths her blue-and-white polka-dot skirt across her knees  --  the same skirt she wore while filming the concentration-camp scenes . ( Like all the clothes Seymour wears in her films , the skirt is now part of her prized costume collection . ) Hanging over the skirt is a baggy white knit sweater ? " my husband 's " ? that drapes her shoulders . Scuffed ballet slippers complete her interview " costume . " Seymour is sitting at a redwood picnic table on the patio of the Santa Barbara , California , home she shares with her husband , David Flynn . ( Flynn is a financial consultant for top show-biz personalities , including Goldie Hawn and Warren Beatty . ) She is momentarily lost remembering the arduous months of filming at Auschwitz , the infamous Nazi extermination camp . She finally says , quietly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remembrance . It was more than an acting piece ; it was a crusade . " In ABC 's lavish adaptation of Herman Wouk 's novel , Seymour portrays Natalie Jastrow ( originally played by Ali MacGraw in Winds of War ) , an American of Jewish heritage who finds herself a victim of Hitler 's persecution . In the last episode of War and Remembrance , aired in November 1988 , Natalie and her uncle , played by Sir John Gielgud , found themselves interned in a ghetto , an interim stop en route to Auschwitz . " Even now I ca n't watch the scenes we shot in Auschwitz without trembling , " Seymour says , wiping a bead of perspiration from her brow . " During the filming we would lose all comprehension of being human beings . There was a presence in that place of something horrendous having happened . " She shakes her head sadly . " I swear you could even smell the dead flesh . " Many of the extras in the film were real survivors of the death camp , " Seymour continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of them were Eastern-bloc Jews who had never been in a movie , and we made everything so real they believed they were back in camp . In one scene a woman next to me , who had been interned in Auschwitz at age 26 and survived , had tears rolling down her face . As we were filming , she looked around and whispered , ' This is real . ' " Seymour says she has memories of stumbling half-naked through scenes in sub-zero weather . In one instance , she was hosed down with water and left covering her breasts in a room filled with naked , shaven-headed extras . " You 're so demeaned , you feel like cattle , " she recalls . She shivers slightly as she remembers the reality of the scene : " The women 's heads were really shaved . In the shower scenes everyone was stark naked  --  even Sir John Gielgud . Thenthe gas chamber . . . . I know that Sir John and I , and the people we worked with on the film , put everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work I did . " She pauses , then adds , " My mother spent four years in a Japanese concentration camp in Java in World War II . " Seymour 's parents  --  her father a London surgeon , and her mother a Dutch concentration-camp survivor  --  named their daughter Joyce Penelope Wilhelmina Frankenberg . Joyce , early in her career , changed her name to that of Henry VIII 's third wife ; now , even her family calls her Jane . Her parents noted that as a child she was different from her sisters , Sally and Anne . " If Jane wanted to do something , she did n't ask , she did n't cry , she just did it , " the actress ' mother recalls . What Jane wanted more than anything was to be a ballet dancer , even though she knew her body was built " totally wrong " for ballet . She is only 5 ' 4 " , but she consoles herself : " I have a long neck and carry myself well from dancing , so I think 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was not built for classical ballet , " she says , " but I was such a high achiever , made my body do more than it could tolerate . " At age 17 , while dancing professionally in Covent Garden with the Kirov Ballet , she suffered a knee injury that ended the dancing career . " As a dancer , I was never technically very brilliant , " Seymour says . " All the reviewers said everything happens ' up top . ' They would say , ' A fine dancer , and a very sensitive actress . ' Since I could n't be a dancer , I decided to become an actress . " Seymour began to perfect her acting craft . In Britain she took to playing every kind of role she could : a striptease artist in Not Now , Darling ; Winston Churchill 's first love in the film Young Winston ; and even the classic roles of Ophelia in Hamlet and Nora in Ibsen 's A Doll 's House . Her big movie break was as Solitaire , the sex symbol in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was off to America , where she would soon rule as queen of the condition  --  which had been followed regularly in the press for a year and a half  --  moved to the front page with the announcement that the ballplayer was critically ill . Medical updates were released three times a day , and hundreds stood vigil outside the East Side hospital , including dozens of children who were n't even old enough to have seen their idol play ball . Taxi drivers would stop in front of the hospital and run inside to get the latest word . More than 15,000 messages and telegrams poured in . Many were from people Ruth had visited when they were in the hospital , like 17-yearold Margie Reardon of Paterson , New Jersey , who wrote , " Dear Babe , you told me to put up a good fight . Now , I hope you 'll do the same thing . You are in all our prayers . " On the morning of August 16 , Ruth , who had grown less bitter and more resigned , told one visitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be here . " That evening , at 6:45 , he suddenly got up out of bed and started to walk across the room . The doctor led him back to bed and asked , " Where are you going , Babe ? " Ruth replied , " I 'm going over the valley . " At 7:30 , he fell into a coma , and a half hour later he died . An estimated 77,000 people passed by his closed coffin at Yankee Stadium . A few days later 75,000 lined Fifth Avenue in the rain for his funeral at St. Patrick 's Cathedral , and another 100,000 watched the procession to Westchester County , where the Babe was buried in Gates of Heaven Cemetery . A Her Son continued from page 28 Mrs. Quayle believes . Still , all the flak is part of politics , she observes : " You have to take it and go on . " And the flap over Dan 's grades ? " I always felt Danny 's grades were good , " she says . " Things came relatively easy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The thing about it was , it was a non-story , " she says . " They the media blew it out of proportion . They made far too much over it . " And , she adds , her husband would n't let Dan or anyone else escape the draft . But that was 20 years ago , and now an exciting future lies ahead . Dan likes his new role , she says : " He relates well to people and communicates well . In getting along with people , he 's A-1 . " While growing up , Dan was extremely active , she recalls : " If he was in the house very long he would say , ' Let 's fish or play golf . ' " He also liked basketball and football . If he had to stay inside , he preferred reading the newspaper to listening to records or watching television . He 's like her husband , Jim  --  he 's full of nervous energy , and he inherited his father 's likability . " He 's someone you like . People gravitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a caring attitude even when he was a child  --  how at age eight he pitched in and helped while his father was ill and at age ten what a great aid he was when the twins were born . Mrs. Quayle views Dan 's vice presidency as a gift because he has such qualities . " It 's a gift to the country , " she says . " I really feel that way . " Jane Seymour continued from page 43 miniseries . She languished for a while in such potboilers as Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders , until her star quality began to glisten . The actress was nominated for her first Emmy for her role in the 1976 TV special Captains and the Kings , but she feels she gave a better performance in the 1981 TV version of John Steinbeck 's East of Eden , in which she portrayed Kate , the venomous brothel owner . " Kate haunted me totally , " Seymour says . " 1 really began to feel 1 was her , and it took me weeks to get out of her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a part I 'd like to play every day of the year , as it could destroy my life . " Then came her roles as Hemingway 's Lady Brett Ashley in The Sun Also Rises and identical twins ( one psychotic ) in Dark Mirror , followed by Crossings and her more recent successes in 1988 . When asked how many miniseries she has been in , she is genuinely stumped but thinks " around 17 . " What is it about this intense English actress that makes her come alive in front of the TV camera ? Seymour leans forward on the patio table and folds her hands . Her arms are delicate . " I 'm fortunate , " she says . " I 'm working with an instrument that loves me . I 'm definitely not the prettiest or most beautiful person in the world . One smitten cinematographer has disagreed : " Wow  --  if Bo Derek 's a 10 , this lady 's a 101/2 . ' There are so many women who are more spectacular looking . But the camera does find things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move my face , if I just think about something , the camera picks it up and broadcasts it loud and clear . The camera sucks these things out of me . " One reviewer who had seen her as the evil Kate in East of Eden said : " She was terrifying . I do n't care how pleasant she is in real life ; she must have found something awful inside of her to play from . " " I have a lot of people inside me , " she acknowledges , " and am so blessed to be in a profession where they pay me to discover these people ! " The question seems to ask itself : Do you like yourself on the screen ? " Oh , no ! I 'm never pleased with anything I 've done , " she says . " I 've always criticized my acting . I take the whole thing apart . " But she does seem pleased with another product of her talents  --  her book , A Guide to Romantic Living , written " more or less to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnant with her second child , Sean . " I 'm not a writer , " she says . " I 've never taken a writing lesson . I do n't know anything about writing books . But I do know how to express myself , and that 's what I did , I wrote it with anything I could find , which in my house is a child 's crayon . " She excuses herself , rises from the patio table , walks into the house , and returns quickly with a copy of A Guide to Romantic Living . " I wrote the book for the person who wants to live romantically , " she says . " Take someone you love and go to the beach , watch the waves roll in. . . do n't wait for a holiday . Surprise the other person . Do it ! Whatever your romantic dream , do it . You see all those cards showing a couple walking the beach at sunset ? Well , do n't buy the cards  --  walk the beach first , then send the card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own romantic fantasy : she has a handsome husband ; two lovely children , Katie and Sean ; a 15th-century manor house , St. Catherine 's Court , in the English countryside ; and a skyrocketing career as an actress . " I pinch myself every day , " she says . " My life is way beyond any dream I ever had . " If one movie role captures her romantic , nostalgic image best , it is her favorite as the turn-of-the-century beauty in Somewhere in Time . " That film was very much me , " Seymour says . " Pm not sure I believe in a past life , but I feel comfortable in that era . There 's something very strange . . . . " She opens her book to an oval photograph taken for the movie showing her in a Victorian dress . Next to it is another oval photograph , a turn-ofthe-century portrait of Seymour 's Dutch grandmother in a similar pose . " My mother found this picture of my grandmother in the bottom of an old drawer years after I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asks . She closes the book , then continues , " Somewhere in Time had an enormous effect on people and was one of the reasons I wrote my guide to romantic living . I guess I feel more at home in the Victorian era than I do today . " The door to the patio opens , and a nanny comes out with Jane 's two red-haired children . She hugs the children , then says , " I guess everything is a compromise . I may never become the world 's greatest actress , because I 've gotten married and had children . But I 've rarely been disappointed ? ultimately . " And does Jane Seymour want to continue acting when she 's 80 ? " Oh , yes ! I must always have something to do with films , television , or theater . I love it . I thrive on it . Like Helen Hayes and like Ruth Gordon , I think people who work until they are older are much happier . " Step aside for the " dowager " queen of the miniseries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health improved sufficiently for him to attend the two-week trial in December 1988 , some 3 ' years after the nightmare had begun . He and Sandy were among the 20 witnesses called by Habush to testify . During his time on the stand John quoted from Psalm 38 : " I am bowed down greatly ; I go mourning all the day long . For my loins are full of inflammation , and there is no soundness in my flesh . I am feeble and severely broken . I groan because of the turmoil of my heart " ( New King James Version ) . If John 's testimony touched the jurors ' emotions , the words of the expert witnesses reached out to their intellects . The scholarly physicians delivered a patient , abbreviated course in disease containment . " Dr. Engle-man was one of the best I 've ever seen in the courtroom , " Habush says . " He explained AIDS to the jury ; he taught them from the ground floor up what this disease means and how it is acquired . He also taught them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood bankers as the ones we were suing by the time the trial was over . " Dr. Ronald Kerman , an immunologist from the University of Texas , said the decision not to check the blood and blood products on inventory was " scientifically unconscionable . " Upholding Kerman 's opinion was Dr. James Mosley , an epidemiologist from the University of Southern California in Los Angeles . " They should not have shipped untested concentrate if they could have shipped tested concentrate , " Mosley said . " They should have been more diligent in informing the hospitals who received frozen products of the hazards of untested materials . " The jury was unmoved by the defense 's twofold argument that when John Carroll had his surgery the reliability of AIDS testing was uncertain and that tested blood was not known to be safer than untested blood . Neither was the jury affected by the attempt to label April 1985 as a " phase-in " period when tested blood was gradually taking the place of untested products . Speaking for the defense , Harold Oberman from the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center 's procedure for checking for AIDS exceeded the standards of most centers in 1985 . If true , was the jury to believe that other blood bankers continued to ship inventories of untested blood or to permit the hospitals they supplied to use untested blood many weeks after tested blood had been available ? Two wrongs would n't make a right , and the possibility of many such instances must have made them shudder . After five hours of deliberation , the unanimous verdict was returned .
