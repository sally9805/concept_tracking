THE IMPRESARIO By Isaac Bashevis Singer On my journey to Argentina 1 stopped for some two weeks in Brazil . The Yiddishists were to have organized a lecture for me , but they kept postponing it . When I arrived on the boat to Santos the sponsor had given me a large manuscript of his , apparently expecting a letter of praise . I was not in need of the lecture and neither was I willing to tell lies about his work , which I did n't like . Suddenly I had a lot of spare time on my hands . Autumn had begun in New York , but here it was the beginning of spring . I had brought my own writings and I was working on them in my hotel room , which faced the Atlantic . Fresh breezes wafted scents of tropical plants and fruits for which I had no name in Yiddish . White sailboats rocked over the waves . They reminded me of corpses in shrouds . The sponsor of my lecture called repeatedly but I was not in a rush to respond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the receiver , I heard an unfamiliar voice and the coughing and stammering of one who does not know where to begin . He was saying , " I am a devoted reader of yours . I discovered you years before anyone else . It would be a great honor for me if ... " The man on the other end lost his tongue . I invited him up to the room and ten minutes later he knocked at my door . I opened it and saw an emaciated man , pale , with a thin nose , sunken cheeks , and a protruding Adam 's apple . He carried a little valise which I was sure was full of manuscripts . Like an old doctor , I made the diagnosis at first sight . He had written for years without recognition . The editors are ignorant , the publishers a bunch of money-minded fakers . Should he continue to write ? I offered him a chair and he sat down , thanking me and apologizing profusely . Then I heard him say , " 1 have a gift for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet I heard the Isaac Bashevis Singer won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1978 . His most recent book is The Image and Other Stories . cynic in me saying : It 's a book of poems he published himself with a dedication to his wife without whose help this work would have never been written or printed . He took a bottle of wine and an ornate box of cookies from his valise . He mumbled something which I could not make out . My estimation of the man was completely false . He was not a poet but a professor of German and French at the University of Rio . He had deserted the Austrian army at the time of the First World War . His father had owned an oil well in Galicia , in the region of Drohobycz . My guest 's name was Alfred Reisner . He spoke an idiomatic Yiddish and had come to tell me a story and to find out why my lecture had been postponed . We became quite familiar and I said to him , " If your story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was postponed . But you will have to keep it a secret . " " 1 keep many secrets . " " Before you begin the story , may I ask you about your health ? You seem frail to me , or fatigued , " I said . " What ? You are mistaken , like all the others , " Alfred Reisner answered . " Every time I get on a bus , passengers get up for me , even young women , as if I were a tottering old man . But I 'm strong like iron . I am in my early sixties and I walk each day between twelve and sixteen kilometers. 1 was never sick a day in my life . As they say , ' It should remain so for a hundred and twenty years . ' However , I am not eager to live long . " " Why not ? " " You will soon know . " I called room service and ordered coffee  --  not the strong black coffee they drink in Brazil , but coffee with cream and sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought . I heard him say , " I was afraid to call you . I have great respect for creative people . Every time I read you , I have a desire to contact you , but 1 never do . Why should I take up your valuable time ? I hoped to meet you at the lecture here in Rio , but I knew that you would be surrounded by hordes of people . You often mention Spinoza in your stories . I imagine that he is your most beloved philosopher . Are you still a Spinozaist ? " " Not a Spinozaist , but a pantheist , " I said . " Spinoza was a determinist , but I believe in free will , or bechira . This means ... " " I know what bechira means , " Alfred Reisner said . " My father arranged for a Hebrew teacher to tutor me in the Bible and the Mishnah . When the First World War broke out and the Russians invaded Galicia , our family escaped to Vienna . My father was religious to a degree but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and knew eight languages . I was horn a linguist , so to speak , myself . I entered the university in Vienna , but later I was mobilized and sent to the Italian front . As I told you , I had no desire to defend the Hapsburg empire , and so I deserted . " " Is this your story ? " " Only the beginning , if you will spare me some of your time . I hope that what I want to tell you will he of interest to you . You often write on the topic of jealousy . Have you noticed that modem fiction writers ceased writing about this subject ? The critics have written with so much aversion about what they call the bedroom novel that the writers have become frightened . Jealousy has become almost an anachronism in modern literature . But I always considered jealousy a mighty human and even animal instinct and the very crux of the novel . I admired Strindberg highly and read every word he wrote . The reason for this admiration was the fact that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an extremely jealous man . When I studied in the gymnasium it was enough that my girlfriend would smile at another student for me to cut off all relations with her . I had decided to marry a virgin ; if possible , one who had never dated another man . To me a man betrayed was a man defiled  --  a leper . You asked before if I was sick . The truth is that when I was twenty years of age I already looked old , sick , frail . I sometimes think that the fear of ending up a cuckold , and the knowledge that the whole male gender is at the mercy of women , wore me out . But my seeming frailty also helped me during the war . No one suspected me of being a deserter . Do you still want me to continue my story ? " Alfred Reisner asked . " Yes , I do . " " Well , it 's very kind of you . At that time in Vienna I became involved with a young woman from the Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. Her father and mother were unknown Yiddish actors who dragged around performing in stables and firehouses . Her name is Manya . She began to act with her parents when she was only five . They put on Goldfaden 's and Latteiner 's plays and she also performed in some kitsch plays which her father had written . He spelled Noah with seven mistakes , as they say . " At the time of the war Manya came to Vienna and tried to produce her father 's plays . In Warsaw , a wealthy man impressed with her voice paid for her singing lessons . She eventually got a ob in the opera chorus  --  no small achievement for a Jewish wench . Her father had died of typhoid fever in 1915 . Her mother had become someone 's housekeeper , and mistress as well . " Even now , at sixty , Manya is still good-looking , but when I met her she was a rare beauty . I watched as she sang lascivious songs in a Yiddish theater to which Galician refugees came . It was a combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If she came to visit late at night she always brought me a hag of leftovers . Once in a while I had to give her two crowns to pay for her fare . When she sang ' In the Holy Temple in a corner of the room sits the widow of Zion wrapped in gloom , ' her voice enchanted me . It stirred up a storm in my soul . I fell passionately in love with her and was ready to marry her on the spot . But when Manya began to reveal her sexual past , it created a terrible crisis in me . I was so shattered that I felt like killing her as well as myself . By nineteen she had had a roster of over twenty lovers , among them her own father , he should roast in Gehenna . She also had some experience as a lesbian . She had tasted it all : sadism , masochism , exhibitionism , every possible perversion . She boasted to me about her sins , and despite my love , I developed a fierce hatred toward her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it willingly . She was proud of her lechery . Most of the men she had had were low-lifer , people of the underworld . In some cases she did n't even remember their names . Some of them were Poles connected with the Warsaw opera . She spoke to me and laughed as if the whole thing were nothing but a joke . This woman who sang so beautifully about the Holy Temple and the widow of Zion had not the slightest respect for Jewishness and Jewish history and no feeling for the Holy Land . Her body was nothing more than a piece of flesh for her to give away for the slightest favor , for a bit of flattery , or for the mere curiosity of tasting another male . She spat profanities like the shells of sunflower seeds . Millions of men fought on the fronts and died for their country , while Manya had one ambition : to become a cheap operetta singer and to sing out all the banalities with which the librettos are packed . And also to go to bed with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While she confessed , she kissed and fondled me and tried to assure me that she was deeply in love with me , but I knew she spoke the same way to all the other men and would continue to do so to those who would come after me . I had fallen in love with a whore . That night I had a desire to leap from the bed and run . But that would have been pure suicide , since I was a deserter and Vienna was teeming with military police . To go home to my parents would endanger them , too . " Alfred Reisner took out a cigarette , rolled it between his fingers , and lit it with a lighter . " Yes , I wanted to run away from this lewd piece , but I did not run . She disgusted me , but as I kissed her and caressed her I was silly enough to demand that she be a woman like my mother and grandmother . She was so sure of her power over me that she refused even to promise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us should be allowed to have others . " What did she look like , you are wondering . She was not tall , but slim , with black hair and black eyes which expressed passion , insolence , mockery . She had an uncanny power of speech . We in Galicia speak Yiddish slightly mixed with German . But her Warsaw Yiddish had all the idioms and linguistic gems of your region . And they flowed from her mouth like from a sack with holes . When she cursed , the curses poured out like a stream of poison . When she became erotically excited , she used words at which a regiment of Cossacks would blush . I have met many cynics in my life , but Manya 's cynicism was incomparable . I often played with the idea of writing down her salacious expressions , all her vulgar jokes , and then publishing them , but this plan of mine , like many others , was never realized . " Everything came at once : the revolution in Russia , the pogroms in the Ukraine , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empire . Poland became independent almost overnight and my parents demanded that 1 go back home with them . But after Vienna , Drohobycz looked like a hamlet , not a city . Besides , Manya wanted to go back to Warsaw , and that is where we went . The hooligans in Lemberg made a pogrom against the Jews . The trains were swarming with General Haler 's soldiers , who cut Jewish beards . England came out with the Balfour Declaration and Zionism ceased being a dream . If you were in Warsaw at that time , you know what went on : a mixture of war , revolution , assassinations . First Pilsudski chased the Bolsheviks to Kiev . Then Trotsky chased the Polish army to the Vistula , where a military miracle was supposed to have occurred . They wanted to make a Polish soldier out of me and send me to fight for my freshly hatched fatherland . But a ' miracle ' happened to me , toe . I acquired a passport with a false birth date . " Jewish Warsaw was boiling like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived in Warsaw penniless , but Manya bumped into a former lover , a speculator , a would-be patron of the arts . His name was Zygmund Pelzer . When Zygmund kissed Manya , I became dizzy , and my heart was beating like a hammer . I knew that to live with this woman would be permanent hell for me . I swore a holy oath to get rid of her once and for all . Two weeks later , we got married . " She had given me an ultimatum : either get married or get out . She gave me three days to think it over . I convinced myself then that I was nothing but a miserable slave . I do n't think I slept a wink those three nights . " I once read an article of yours where you complained that the philosophers ignored the emotions and considered them a plague . Actually , the emotions are the very essence of our being . When Descartes said Cogito , ergo sum , he should have been talking about the emotions . Your Spinoza 's adoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To make it short , we went to an unofficial rabbi and he filled out a Ketubah and then set up a canopy . And who do you suppose gave away the bride ? The same Zygmund Pelzer , her lover . " ow did you become a professor in Brazil ? " I asked . Alfred Reisner did not answer immediately . " How did it happen ? Some years later , a so-called impresario , a Pole , came from South America to Warsaw . I say ' so-called ' because I 've never seen him practice his profession , or any other profession , for that matter . His name is Zdizislaw Romanski , a tall blond fellow and quite a charmer . He heard Manya sing in a trashy vaudeville theater and decided that she was exactly what he was looking for . He signed her up , took her to Brazil , and I dragged after them . " For me to learn Portuguese was easy , since I knew Latin and French . A position was open at the University of Rio for an assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I began to teach French too . Manya could have become rich with her voice , but the charlatan , the impresario , invaded her life and my life as well . It began on the ship to Brazil . " Two things I have learned in my life of disgrace . First , that the whole concept of free will , free choice , and all other phrases about human freedom are sheer nonsense . Man has no more freedom than a bedbug . In this respect , Spinoza was right . However , consistent determinist that he was , he had no reason to preach ethics . The second thing I have learned is that under certain circumstances , every human passion can reverse itself and become the very opposite of what it was . From a psychological point of view , Hegel was right : each thesis proceeds in the direction of its antithesis . The mightiest love can become the most venomous hatred . A wild anti-Semite can become an ardent lover of the Jews or even a convert to Judaism . A miser can suddenly begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a murderer . The man who sits before you lived through many metamorphoses . One time I was burning with jealousy . The mere thought that my wife could have the slightest desire for another man drove me to insanity . A few years later , I came to the point that I could lie with Manya and her lover in one bed . Please do n't ask me for any details or explanations . Pleasure itself is a form of suffering . Asceticism and hedonism are actually synonymous . I know that I am not revealing anything new to you . Our religious sages knew about it in their way . " " What kind of person is this impresario ? " I asked . " A demon . " " How old is he ? " " Who knows how old a demon is ? A true word never came out of his mouth  --  a psychopathic liar , a crazy boasrer . According to him , all the beauties in Poland were his concubines , Pilsudski and his generals were all on a first-name basis with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform all kinds of heroic acts and he received countless medals . As far as I could tell , he never served in the military . Neither was he descended from counts and barons . His father was nothing but a notary public in Wolhynia . " After all I have been through , nothing astonishes me anymore . Nevertheless , whenever I have the feeling that he can no longer surprise us , he does something which baffles me completely . His physical strength was and still is extraordinary . Although he is the worst alcoholic I 've known , I have never known him to be ill . According to medical theory , he should have burned out his stomach and his bowels by now . Every morning when he opens his eyes , he repeats the same joke , ' I 'm going to gargle with mouthwash , ' and the mouthwash is a tea glass of vodka on an empty stomach . He turned tvianya into a drunkard also . He continually threatens Manya and me with suicide , or that he is going to kill both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Who pays the bills ? " I asked . " Did n't he ever try to do anything ? " " Only when he was sure to fail . " " Would you call yourself a masochist ? " I asked . " As good a name as any . Yes , me , them , and the whole human race ; its wars , revolutions , arts , even its religions . Humanity is nothing but a permanent rebellion against God and what Spinoza called the order of things , or nature . Man was born a slave and with the bitterness of a slave . He has to do the opposite of what he is forced to do . He is God 's eternal opposition ; actually Satan . " " Do you believe that your impresario is still in love with Mama ? " I asked . Alfred Reisner seemed to shudder . " In love ? Who knows what love is ? The whole notion of love is vague and ambiguous . But when you are dealing with a demon , what kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She calls him ' my angel of death . ' She drank until she lost her voice . She has a throat disease which the doctors in Brazil can not identify , a type of cancer . Quite often she becomes dangerously sick and we have to take her to the hospital . She gets asthma and loses the power of speech . Once she coughed so terribly I had to rush her to the hospital , and they discovered a collapsed lung . ' It all came as a result of drinking , screaming , trying to sing without a voice , pushing the body to be young when it was ordered to be old . These two have waged a twenty-year war , a bitter war , a war of madness and mutiny . Unbelievable as it sounds , I have n't figured out in all these years what they are fighting about . You forget such things like a nightmare . Both of them rave at the same time , she in Yiddish and he in Polish . They carry on unrelated mono , logues . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be material for a literary masterpiece . Different as we are , all three of us have one common quality : we have not the slightest sense for practical matters . When a fuse blows in our home , we sit there in the dark for hours helplessly waiting for the superintendent , who is a drunk himself and never available . We lose money , we forget dates , we are constantly in a state of utter confusion , A day does n't pass when something doesn'tbreak down in our caricature of a house : the electricity , the gas , the toilet , the telephone . When it rains , the water leaks right through the roof into the bedroom and we have to cover the floor with buckets . Yes , you can call us masochists . But why just the three of us ? And what miserable fate keeps us together year after year after year ? We have given ourselves the holiest oaths to part once and for all and put an end to this tragicomedy of an existence . We have actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times and under the most bizarre circumstances , but we always come hack to the same mess , the same madness , drawn by a power for which I have n't yet found a name in any dictionary , encyclopedia , you name it . Neither Freud nor Adler nor Jung could have ever explained it by their various theories . Passion ? You can call it passion , complex , insanity , or simply meshugas . We leave and we get sick from yearning and brooding . We write desperate letters to one another and plead for peace , forgiveness , a fresh start , and other ridiculous banalities of which we make fun ourselves . We laugh and cry and spit when we meet again and we drink a toast to our mutual dybbuk . Yes , I too have learned to drink , although not as much as they . I could not afford it . I have a family to provide for , woe is to me . " Alfred Reisner glanced at his wristwatch and said , " It is later than I thought . Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . To whom could I tell a story like this ? There are philosophers , psychologists , and even those who consider themselves writers at the university , but to confide in them would be sheer sui , cide . Aside from the office girl who sends my salary every month , no one knows my address . Now that I 'm as good as retired , I 'm as good as a corpse . Well , how about your lecture ? Will it ever take place ? " " I 'm afraid it wo n't , " I said . " Could you tell me the reason ? " The telephone rang and the sponsor told me that my lecture had been rescheduled . He gave me the date . I conveyed the news to my guest and for a moment his eyes lit up . " These are good tidings . It will be an event . We will come to hear you . All three of us . " " The Pole also ? " I asked . Alfred Reisner thought it over . " Since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is a Pole , a Russian , or a Jew ? He is a great admirer of yours . He reads you in English and in French . A little bit in Yiddish , too . Do n't be afraid . He wo n't come to the lecture riding on a broom , with a tail and horns . When he needs to , he can be a perfect gentleman . " ? ( Translated from the Yiddish by the author. )
