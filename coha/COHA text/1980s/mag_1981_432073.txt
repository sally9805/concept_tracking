 | Fed up with being victimized by crime , harried Americans are doubling up their fists and fighting back . People from coast to coast are acting on their own to obtain better security , no longer content to rely on law-enforcement officials alone for protection . Neighborhood " watch teams , " a lightly supported novelty only a few years ago , are blossoming in every region . Homeowners are shelling out big money for alarm systems , burglar bars , watchdogs ? as well as guns and paralyzer sprays for a last line of defense . Businesses are protecting employes with " modern-day versions of moats and alligators , " as one study puts it . Fear is the catalyst ? community fear of vandals and muggers , corporate fear of terrorists and kidnappers , and a nationwide conviction that crime has overwhelmed all traditional defenses . According to Federal Bureau of Investigation statistics Offenses of all types rose by 10 percent in the United States from 1979 to 1980 , and violent crimes jumped by 13 percent , the most dramatic increases since 1975 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aggravated assault by 8 percent and murder by 7 percent . Among property crimes , burglary showed a rise of 14 percent and larceny 8 percent . No locale was safe . Reported crime went up in cities of all sizes , in suburbs and in rural areas . Separate figures from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics , based on household surveys rather than police reports , indicate that per capita U.S. crime rates remained relatively stable from 1974 through 1980 ? but at staggeringly high levels . Thirty percent of all households in the United States experienced some type of crime and 6 percent suffered a violent crime in 1980 , according to the surveys . Americans are not just frightened by all this ; they are angry and determined to protect themselves . A picture of people 's indignation and resolve emerged in interviews conducted by U S.News &; World Report staff members with private citizens , community leaders , security experts and corporate officials . " Residents here are just fed up , " said Diane Kerckhoff , a leader of the Women 's Crusade Against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many Americans . " They have n't noticed any decrease in crime and they 're going to start reacting . They 're going to start taking the blame and the responsibility . " Starting below and continuing on the following pages are reports from across the country on what Americans are doing to combat crime at the individual , community and corporate levels . In a spirit reminiscent of frontier days , Americans are joining forces to rid their neighborhoods of crime . Community " watch groups " are thriving from New England to Southern California , in tough inner-city areas and posh suburbs ? using eyes , ears , feet and automobiles in home-grown , anticrime surveillance networks . From every sign , the efforts are paying off : In Pacific Palisades , a well-to-do Los Angeles community where President Reagan formerly lived , residents  | credit a new buddy-system watch program with reducing serious crime by 10 percent so far this year . In Harlingen , Tex. , volunteers patrolling in golf carts have cut the burglary rate nearly to zero in their affluent neighborhood of 421 homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed watch groups in 764 buildings . In some cases , crime rates have been cut merely by stationing female volunteers in the lobbies to screen strangers and alert police when necessary . In Chicago 's Edgewater district , a neighborhood that has long had a reputation as dangerous , volunteers patrol the streets in radio-equipped cars . Edgewater 's crime rate is now lower than that of Evanston , a comfortable Chicago suburb . " Not only are such groups increasing each day , " says New York City police spokesman Richard Shapiro , " but we can document that when a community organization works with police , crime prevention does work . " Now an effort is under way to link the scattered groups via a National Association of Town Watch . Envisioned is a clearinghouse through which community units could swap crime-prevention tips and news of activities in their areas . Matt Peskin , an Ardmore , Pa. , watch leader organizing the national group , says that some 300 groups so far have expressed interest . Los Angeles is credited with starting the current wave of crime-watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later when the federal Law Enforcement Assistance Administration began providing support . LEAA , scheduled to be phased out under Reagan budget-cutting directives , has since spent 1.5 million dollars to encourage formation of some 4,000 watch groups around the country . Added impetus has come from rising crime rates and budget crises that have forced many cities to lay off policemen . In Coral Gables , Fla. , recently , more than 1,000 people jammed into a 600-seat auditorium for a meeting of the Citizens Crime Watch Committee . Five years ago , only a handful of residents backed the program . When Detroit laid off 700 police officers last September , residents of the city 's Lonyo-McGraw neighborhood reactivated a citizens ' patrol . More than 100 residents are now involved . Many of those most active are crime victims who want to fight back . Eighteen months ago , the home of Phil Madson , a 32-year-old engineer in Cincinnati 's Kennedy Heights area , was burglarized for the second time in a year . " After the second time , we became afraid to go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions were being controlled by a small group of people who had no right to control them . " Madson helped to organize a patrol using radio-equipped cars . The area now has the lowest crime rate in its district . " I feel like my community belongs to the good guys now , " he says . Neighborhood watch programs use differing tactics to combat crime . In the basic approach , police simply encourage neighbors to get to know each other , to exchange phone numbers and to call the police if they see anything suspicious . In effect , the members serve as the eyes and ears of the law . In the San Francisco suburb of Lafayette , such a system has helped solve more than 20 percent of the reported burglaries ? double the U.S. average . Another approach is favored by some Boston neighborhoods . Participants put green bulbs in their porch lights as a sign of refuge for any woman who feels threatened while walking at night . In Strathmeade Square , a suburban townhouse community near Washington , D.C. , watch teams stroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evenings . Equipped with walkie-talkies , they report any sign of trouble to a home-based neighbor , who calls the police . Some communities vary this approach by conducting their patrols in cars or vans , sometimes equipped with CB radios for police contact . Police in many areas oppose the patrol concept . Says Mark Howard , head of Seattle 's Crime Prevention Program : " People do n't understand how much can be involved . They might find themselves in a very dangerous situation . " Mack Gordon , a 64-year-old retired businessman who lives in Atlanta 's Inman Park area , learned how dangerous it can be . On patrol one night , he surprised a burglar preparing to break into a house . He stopped the burglary , but most of his front teeth were knocked out . " I now tell members to call the police first , then call me , " Gordon says . Vigilantes opposed . One thing police across the country are agreed upon : Citizen volunteers should not be armed . " We are not trying to get vigilante groups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , D.C. Some groups , such as the Alliance of Guardian Angels , Inc. , whose young members wear commando-style berets as they patrol the New York subways , make citizens ' arrests and come close to the vigilante approach . In late May , the organization reached an accord with the city in which it was recognized as " an independent , autonomous citizens ' group . " But authorities in San Francisco and Chicago have labeled the Guardian Angels as " vigilantes " and have resisted their efforts to expand to those cities . A development that might slow the movement is the end of federal funds . With LEAA scheduled to be dismantled , money for police programs that support watch groups is being cut off . Still , the community watch has established itself across the country , with more and more citizens taking the view that the police alone can not make their neighborhoods safe . " The greatest deterrent , " sums up Detroit Police Inspector James Humphrey , " is a neighborhood that 's very , very nosy . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
