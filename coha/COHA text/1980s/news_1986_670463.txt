In some cases , the farms were part of diversified investment portfolios and were used almost solely to shelter high incomes . In other cases , such as with the Kellners , urban investors bought farms not only to take advantage of tax breaks but also to fulfill dreams of living closer to the land . The Kellners , for example , liquidated Better Cravats and have been working and living on the farm full-time since the early 1980 ' s . Indeed , more than 60 of the county ' s 305 farms are owned by well-off urbanites , according to the county . <> <> A Boon for County // And the nouveau landed gentry of Columbia County have taken their farming seriously . Large sums have been spent to replace rusted equipment , rebuild sagging barns , revitalize tired land , and produce some of the most efficient fruit , dairy and cattle farms in the East . All of this activity has set off an explosion in land prices and contributed to an economic and cultural renaissance in Hudson , the county ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // In recent weeks , however , farmers and real estate agents in the county have become concerned about the new Tax Reform Act and how it might affect investment strategies. // Under the law , agriculture investments are not to be used to shelter income . Thus the law could cause problems for Columbia and other largely rural counties close to metropolitan areas across the country that have attracted similar concentrations of gentlemen farmers. // Among the chief concerns of farmers , realtors and residents here is that the tax law might cause high-income investors to choose not to buy entire farms and instead purchase smaller parcels . The result could lead to higher concentrations of homes , greater population density and the swift end of the rural landscape that residents here cherish . <> <> Land Sales Feared // There is also concern that the owners of dairy and orchard farms established in the 1970 ' s principally as tax shelters will sell their holdings , producing a surplus of available land and causing both land and livestock prices to tumble. // Several large dairy farms in Columbia County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , and at least one of those farms is selling its land . Realtors expect several more large farms to go on the market next year. // Most farmers here , wealthy or not , say that the bill , which eliminates the 10 percent investment tax credit and lengthens the number of years over which a farmer can depreciate equipment to seven from five , will discourage the purchase of tractors , the improvement of dairy herds and the planting of modern varieties of applies , and will otherwise injure their ability to produce food at the lowest costs. // In addition , the bill bars investors not actively engaged in farming from deducting farm losses from their primary income . And the bill would treat capital gains as ordinary income . <> <> Family Farmers Hail Law // In the Middle West , South and Rocky Mountain states , most family farmers cheered the passage of the tax bill . The old tax structure , they said , encouraged non-farmers to establish limited partnerships ; purchase shares of livestock syndications and enter into other financial arrangements to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that helped shelter their incomes . The investment , which came to billions of dollars annually , contributed to the nation ' s surpluses of beef , pork , fruit and other commodities and helped drive prices down. // " The new bill is going to ferret out the abusive tax shelters and that is good for agriculture , " said Dale Jahr , senior economist with the Congressional Joint Economic Committee , who has been studying the effect of tax laws on agricultural investment . " The reform law will force people to base their investment strategies on sound economic judgments that will yield a real return. " // Yet in Columbia , five other Hudson River Valley counties and several western Connecticut counties where farming and real estate development are two of the largest industries , the tax-sheltering advantages in agriculture proved to be as beneficial over the last decade as the proximity to New York City , according to real estate agents. // Mr. and Mrs. Kellner , for instance , said they never needed the tax breaks , but the sheltering advantages helped when it came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is down the road from a 2 , 200-acre farm owned by David Rockefeller , former chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank . <> <> ' A Beautiful Way of Life ' // " Farming is something that ' s in your blood , " said Mrs. Kellner . " I begged him not to buy this place . Farmers never make money . But we lived in the city so long , and this is such a beautiful way of life . " Far below to the west , the Hudson River is like a silver ribbon wrapped about the foothills of the Catskill range . To the east , the flanks of the Berkshire Mountains have slipped into the embrace of a seasonal change. // Since they bought the farm from the golf champion Gene Sarazen , the Kellners have planted acres of new apple trees and vineyards , dug new irrigation ponds , built a swimming pool and a tennis court and graced their yard with statuary . The Kellners employ five farm workers full-time including a farm manager . In all , their operation resembles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tax breaks , however , the farm has never earned a profit - the Kellners live on the dividends and interest from previous investments . But the farm is now worth at least 10 times what they paid for it . <> <> No Resentment // When they started to rebuild the farm , the Kellners said , they worried that nearby family farmers would resent them . But their farm manager , Richard Diehl , a member of a farm family that has lived in Columbia County since the turn of the century , said local farmers welcomed the Kellners and other wealthy investors. // " Prices for land started going up , " Mr. Diehl said . " The dirt farmers knew that when they got old , they could walk away with a fortune. " // Other wealthy investors in Columbia County said they might not have been able to buy farms without the tax advantages . East of Hudson , along Route 23 , Dr. Calvin Rasweiler , a surgeon in Garden City , L.I. , has bought 800 acres since 1969 . His son , Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bill , a 1976 Westbury High School graduate , boasts about being the only farmer in his class . And he is certain that without the investment advantages contained in previous tax laws , he might never have had the chance to take up a line of work he has come to love . <> <> ' Takes a Lot of Money ' // " My father bought the first farm as a retreat , " Bill Rasweiler said while standing beneath an old oak ablaze in fall colors . " Then we started taking the agricultural part pretty seriously . There ' s no question the tax advantages allowed us to turn a few beat-up old farms into a business that is close to being able to pay for itself . But the tax bill is not going to allow anybody else at our financial level to be able to repeat what we did . That could hurt agriculture in this country , because it takes a lot of money to make an operation efficient. " // Mr. Rasweiler said his father was not going to sell the farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several other farms established as tax shelters are selling assets and land. // " Is this going to cause a decline in land values ? " asked Jay Metz , a cattle farmer and restaurant owner , who is buying farms and dividing them into small parcels along the county ' s southern border . " For sure prices will come down . How much ? Nobody knows . But next year , farmers probably won ' t get what they could have gotten last year . " <> <> No Price Weakness Yet // Most realtors , however , said they had not seen any softening in land prices yet . More and more of New York ' s wealthy families are seeking to buy land in Columbia County . And the competition between developers who want to cut farms into smaller parcels and those looking to preserve the county ' s rural character by joining contiguous 150-acre farms into 500- and 1 , 000-acre holdings is helping to keep prices high. // " Our problem is a lack of inventory , " said Irving Price , who heads a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several small farms into large tracts . " Our clients didn ' t get into farming because of tax advantages . They got into it because it ' s a challenge and a fantasy . They buy even if we tell them that if they want one foot in a manure pile they better have the other in a money machine. " // And for those farm families that have lived in the county for generations , the rise in values is a troubling blessing . In Valatie , the Ooms family was recently offered $2. 4 million for their 580-acre dairy farm . Tony and Catherine Ooms turned down the offer ; their son wants to be a farmer. // " We ' re going to hold on for now , " said Catherine Ooms . " But maybe 10 years down the road we won ' t be able to afford not to sell . These land values may just push us out. " //
