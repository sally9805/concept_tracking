Throughout his life , which was flushed with publicity , Diego Rivera was often photographed . He filled the frame  --  a 300-lb . Silenus in suspenders and open- neck shirt , the liquid eyes bulging at the rival lens . One image shows him feigning sleep . He lies mountainously in the garden of his house in Coyoacan , his head pillowed on the stony side of an eroded pre-Columbian head . He is pretending to be a big baby dozing by his mother , the Mexican past , touching the root of contentment . No other photo so pungently expresses Rivera 's idea of his own history , as an artist born to link the old Mexico with a new , postcolonial one . <P> Diego Rivera was born a hundred years ago , in 1886 , and he died of cancer in 1957 : 71 years , not a long life by Picassian standards , but a staggeringly exuberant and productive one . All his attributes as an artist , including his sometimes overweening vulgarity , were cast in a large mold . He became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North and Central America in the first half of the 20th century . He played his role for Mexico , part ambassador and part genius loci , to the hilt . His energy had a titanic quality : he covered many acres of wall in Mexico and the U.S. with his murals and left behind a huge output of easel paintings , drawings and prints . Few 20th century artists have been as popular in their own societies . None is more relevant to the debate over " indigenous , " or " national , " art language as against " international style . " A Marxist who read little Marx , he found a deep well of pictorial eloquence in the traditions and miseries of the campesino . " For the first time in the history of art , " Rivera claimed , " Mexican mural painting made the masses the hero of monumental art . " <P> Yet American capitalists wanted him too . In 1930 , when he did his enormous fresco cycle of Mexican history in the Palacio de Cortes at Cuernavaca , a work that made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was paid by Dwight W. Morrow , the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico . In 1931 Abby Aldrich Rockefeller bought Rivera 's sketchbook of the 1928 May Day parade in Moscow . <P> Though such pairings were tailor-made for satire , nothing suggests that his Yanqui patrons were masochists . They wanted the best public art they could get and believed , with reason , that Rivera could supply it . They thought him a cross between Whitman and Picasso . <P> To display such sympathies in the Depression made management look benign . When Edsel Ford wanted to celebrate the Rouge complex and the auto industry , he got Rivera to paint a mural cycle in Detroit ; it attracted 86,000 visitors in its first month . Rivera had no problems in casting American engineers as the heroes of a new age . Encouraged by this , John D. Rockefeller in 1932 commissioned a Rivera mural , Man at the Crossroads Looking with Hope and High Vision to the Choosing of a New and Better Future , for the RCA Building in Rockefeller Center . Rivera put in a head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered to counterface it with some portraits of Lincoln and other moral equivalents . The result of this Mexican standoff was that the Rockefellers effaced the mural , while the Communist Party denounced Rivera for " opportunism . " This finished Rivera 's career as the conflicted Michelangelo of American capitalism , and he went back to Mexico to become the wholehearted Tintoretto of the peons.
