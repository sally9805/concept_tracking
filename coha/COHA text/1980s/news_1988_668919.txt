Editors are not generally known for the pleasure they bring into writers ' lives , and so when I was asked if I would like to participate in a re-creation of Babette ' s feast , I was understandably suspicious . At the time , all I knew of " Babette ' s Feast " was , ( 1 ) it had won , in what many considered an upset over the highly regarded " Au Revoir Les Enfants , " this year ' s Academy Award for Best Foreign Film ; ( 2 ) it was based on a short story by Isak Dinesen , and ( 3 ) it contained a dinner party scene . " You can even take a friend , " said the editor . And so the two of us arrived , shortly before the appointed 7 p. m. dinner hour , at Cafe Provencal in Evanston . We were led through the cozy dining room and into a small , windowed room . Outside , the sun was setting . Inside , a table seemed to groan under the weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses , silverware and candles . Our dinner companions , some of whom were already on hand , represented a distinguished collection of food critics , movie publicists , radio-TV personalities and magazine writers . And me . We were , it goes almost without saying , a crowd that collectively had had enough free meals to feed a small nation for a month . " Oooooooh , look at all the glasses , " said one woman , licking her lips . Though most of the people in the room could lord it over me in the practiced palate department , I did have an advantage over most . I had seen the movie , at an advance screening on Mother ' s Day . Though I will leave the analysis , symbol-search and ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ' s to the critics who will review " Babette ' s Feast " when it opens at the Fine Arts Theater on Friday , it is necessary to know something of the film in order to grasp the significance of what took place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up one rain-swept night in 1871 at the home of two spinster sisters in a tiny village on the Swedish coast . She has fled the riots in Paris and offers her cooking and housekeeping services in exchange for a place to stay . The sisters , daughters of the village ' s late priest/prophet , whose austere Lutheran sect renounces earthly pleasures , are the keepers of his dwindling congregation . They reluctantly agree . For the next 14 years , Babette works for the women . She then learns she has won 10 , 000 francs in the French lottery and offers to cook for the sisters and other members of the congregation-most of whom have lived their 70 or so years on a steady diet of bread and salty fish-a French meal in celebration of the 100th anniversary of their father ' s birth . Soon , Babette is overseeing the delivery of an astonishing boatload of foodstuffs . In a rare act of accord , the diners agree not " to say a word about the food or drinks , " remaining strong in the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dinner is served and . . . why spoil the movie ? There was none of that fighting-temptation nonsense transpiring at Cafe Provencal . Even those who had not seen the film knew enough about the menu to be giddy over anticipated gastronomic delights . When the last guest arrived , all 17 people took their seats and it began , with Sandeman Royal Esmeralda Rare Amontillado Sherry . " This is the first time I ' ve had sherry , " I admitted . My companions at the end of the table regarded the comment with disgust . The first course arrived : Potage a La Tortue , which is turtle soup made from , mind you , boneless loggerhead turtle meat . I tried a different tack . " My , my , " I said . " This potage is delightful . " It was good and , judging from the recipe that came with a pile of press material , difficult to make . Where does one get 11 pounds of cracked veal bones ? Next came Blini Demidoff au Caviar Russe , a rarified pancake deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipe packet , was invented by Price Anatole Demidoff , " one of the most celebrated gastronomes of the Second Empire . " His creation has been " served for centuries " and was accompanied by Champagne Veuve Clicquot Brut . " Ah , some sort of lemonade , " I said . That was a line used in a similar situation by one of the film ' s cute and ancient actresses . No one at my end of the table had seen the film , I had forgotten , and so my attempted bon mot produced not smiles but sneers . The woman across from me said she never ate caviar and passed her plate to my companion who , on the rare occasions she ' s flush enough to indulge herself , east and likes caviar . She gobbled it up . There was a lengthy pause after this course and I knew why . The next plate to be delivered would contain the piece de resistance ; the main course , in other words . It was called Caille en Sarcophage avec Sauce Perigourdine . Even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gras Baked in Puff Pastry Nest with Truffles . But I confidently awaited its arrival . In the movie , one of the guests chews the head of the cooked quail and I was prepared to do the same thing and was anticipating the results . " What are you doing ? " some one would shreik . " My good man ( or woman , as the case might have been ) , were you brought up in a fast food franchise ? " I would respond . " This is how one eats quail . " Alas , the moment never came . The tiny bird arrived without its head . " It ' s impossible to buy a quail with its head in America , " said the restaurant ' s publicist . A glass was filled with red wine , Clos de Vougeot . It was incredibly good but obviously quite dear because , after I quickly polished it off , no amount of suggestively thirsty stares at the waiter could bring more wine to my glass . Water was poured and that ' s what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( slices of Cantal , Fourme d ' Ambert and Blue d ' Auvergne cheese ) , Baba au Rhum et Fruits Confit ( rum cake with candied fruits ) and Les Fruits Frais ( fresh fruits ) . Throughout these final courses , conversations got looser . I could hear snippets from the far end of the table , where Donald Regan ' s new book was a loudly debated topic . At my end , local theater was being discussed and though I tried again and again to bring up the matter of Baba au Rhum and who might not be finishing theirs , I settled for one dessert . A few people were beginning to rub their stomachs when the Cafe ( coffee ) arrived . Every one took a glass of Hine Cognac . Some took more than one . The chef came out of the kitchen and we applauded his efforts . Three hours into dinner , the first people said , " Thank you , we have to go , " and shortly the room emptied . One by one and two by two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made their way to babysitters and suburban-bound trains . They looked full and pleased , if not as overwhelmed as those departing the feast in the movie . The difference was that none of us had lived a life of ale cake and fish . The tastes we had been given this night , as delectable as they were , had not been totally unfamiliar . There will be a lot of opinions on this meal . Just as New York ' s Petrossian restaurant did when " Babette ' s Feast " opened in Manhattan , Cafe Provencal will be recreating Babette ' s Feast on a reservation only basis once the film opens . The tariff will be $90 , $120 with one glass of each of the liquors ( tax and tip not included ) . I ' m fairly sure-editors and my owns tastes being what they are-that I will probably never again have the foods that were this night put before me .

After the dinner in " Babette ' s Feast , " the diners leave the sisters ' house and , under a star-studded sky , join hands and sing the praises of the Lord . The sky above Evanston contained a suitable number of stars . But a song in praise of an editor .
