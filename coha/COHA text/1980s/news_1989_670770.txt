The World Bank , for instance , has recently begun short-term lending to help countries over immediate balance-of-payments problems , which has always been the domain of the I.M.F. // The I.M.F. , meanwhile , has been moving into the bank ' s bailiwick by dabbling in longer-term development finance. // As a result , relations have become strained between the two institutions charged with helping countries grow and stay out of financial trouble . <> <> Falling Back on a Pact // So acute have the tensions become that the I.M.F. recently dug out a 24-year-old accord between the two organizations to reinforce its position as a balance-of-payments lender . The 1965 agreement drew lines between the two jurisdictions , giving the last word to the I.M.F. in the monetary field and to the World Bank in development. // The organizations , each with 151 member countries , were formed during World War II . The World Bank , with about 6 , 000 employees , has historically granted loans for national development , financing nut crops in Burundi and hydraulic works in Brazil . The I.M.F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans to countries having problems with their balance of payments. // Both agencies are based in Washington , about three blocks from the White House , and depend heavily on the United States , which provides more money than any other member and has the greatest influence over their policies . <> <> Relations With U.S. Treasury // Adding to tensions between the two lending organizations , international monetary officials say , is that a rift between the I.M.F. and the United States Treasury has developed at a time when the World Bank and Treasury enjoy good relations. . // On issues like a recent loan to Argentina , support for a Japanese debt plan and the adequacy of I.M.F. resources , the I.M.F. ' s managing director , Michel Camdessus , has taken positions that have rankled the Treasury , American and international officials said. // In contrast , the Treasury has a good relationship with the World Bank . Its president , Barber B. Conable Jr. , is a former Republican Congressman from upstate New York who , like Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady , is an old friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank and the I.M.F. declined to talk on the record about the divisions between the organizations . A Treasury spokesman declined to comment . <> <> Heightened Sensitivity // But a senior World Bank official , who asked not to be identified , said : " There are definite strains over who has the responsibility for macroeconomic policy and how to avoid overlaps . Individual relationships between the institutions are spotty . There is even a morale problem because of the sensitivity on both sides. " // In recent remarks to reporters in Washington , the Dutch Finance Minister , H. O. Ruding , chairman of the I.M.F. ' s policy-making Interim Committee , acknowledged that the two organizations had experienced " misunderstandings and irritations. " // Because of their overlapping policy functions , Mr. Ruding said that " perhaps it is better that they focus on their original mandates. " // Each of the institutions has slipped into the other ' s domain for what seemed to be sound reasons , officials said. // Worried that its projects could fail if the overall economic climate is unfavorable , the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to bolster the economic performance of its clients. // Because of the enormous financial needs of its clients , often the same countries , the I.M.F. has provided ever-increasing loans for economic development on terms stretching beyond five years , compared with one to three years for its balance-of-payments loans. // The I.M.F. has also sought to shake its image - widespread in undeveloped countries but unjustified in its opinion - as an agent of tough austerity measures that often raise prices and lower living standards . <> <> Competition Between Agencies // But the overlapping has led the institutions to operate at cross purposes and even compete in countries like Costa Rica and Argentina , officials of the two institutions said. // In Costa Rica , the I.M.F. has been insisting , among other things , that the Government bring its loan payments to commercial banks up to date as a condition of new aid. // At the same time , officials said , the World Bank is offering short-term I.M.F.-type assistance and telling the Costa Rican Government that its bank arrears are not a problem. // In Argentina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasury by declining to provide assistance that Washington had sought for political reasons . Mr. Camdessus balked on the ground that Argentina was so saddled with debt that it could not make repayments. // The Treasury prevailed on the bank to provide the assistance , which it did in October in four loans totaling $1. 25 billion . Officials at the bank said some of the loans were now past due. // Many ascribe the tensions to a perception that the Treasury seeks to promote the World Bank over the I.M.F. // " There is concern that the U.S. wants to define a bigger role for the bank and that the fund ' s role will suffer because of the bank ' s preferential status , " said Christine A. Bogdanowicz-Bindert , a senior vice president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. // Other analysts see the jockeying for position by the two institutions as a sign of confusion in Washington about how the United States should refine its strategy on world debt. // " No one is sure who is in charge , " noted John Williamson , senior fellow at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group. // A Harvard economics professor , Jeffrey D. Sachs , added , " Our Government has been rather inconsistent and ad hoc in how it uses these institutions. " // He said the United States was pushing the two agencies to expand their operations , " but the more we do this the more their roles become blurred . " <> <> Report Could Provide Answers // Some answers from the Treasury may come when it submits a much-awaited report to Congress on the role of the two institutions and on the Bush Administration ' s overall strategy on world debt. // The report , which is now due in mid-March , is expected to continue the main tenets of the Reagan Administration ' s strategy , known as the Baker Plan after former Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d , who is now Secretary of State. // The Baker Plan calls on heavily indebted countries to deregulate their economies and introduce market-oriented policies . In return , they would receive more loans from commercial banks and lending institutions like the World Bank and the I.M.F. // One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his expressed interest in a broader debt-relief approach , possibly involving the use of money from taxpayers of member countries , which the Treasury strongly opposes . Changing Role for I.M.F. Compounding the I.M.F. ' s turf-encroachment problems is its loss of industrial clients. // Until oil prices quadrupled in the mid-1970 ' s , the I.M.F. ' s role was chiefly as a balance-of-payments lender to industrial countries like Britain and Italy , and as the guardian of fixed exchange rates. //
