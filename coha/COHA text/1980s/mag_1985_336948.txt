The customary reward of defeat , if one can survive it , is in the lessons thereby learned , which may yield victory in the next war . But the circumstances of our defeat in Vietnam were sufficiently ambiguous to deny the nation ( that ) benefit . <P>  --  Edward N. Luttwak <P> The Pentagon and the Art of War <P> Ten years after the fall of Saigon , the debacle in Southeast Asia remains a subject many Americans would rather not discuss . So the nation has been spared a searing , divisive inquest  --  " Who lost Viet Nam ? "  --  but at a heavy price . The old divisions have been buried rather than resolved . They seem ready to break open again whenever anyone asks what lessons the U.S. should draw from its longest war , and the only one to end in an undisguisable defeat . <P> Was that loss inevitable , or could the war have been won with different strategy and tactics ?
