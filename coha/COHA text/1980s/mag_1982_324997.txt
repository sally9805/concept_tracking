OPEC heads for a showdown <P> With world oil markets already in shambles , ministers from the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are planning to gather this weekend in Vienna to make a desperate gamble . They will try to shore up the price of crude on world markets by agreeing to set a production ceiling of 18.5 million bbl. per day , down from 19.2 million bbl. per day currently , and to parcel out the resulting cuts . That is something that the fiercely nationalistic members of the organization have never before managed to achieve . Many Western analysts , emboldened by strife-torn OPEC 's recent setbacks , are predicting that the effort will fail , putting further pressure on prices , which have already slipped by about 3.6% in the past year , to an average of $33.55 per bbl . Others , recalling OPEC'sS clout during the 1970s , are more wary . Says Standard Oil of Indiana 's chief economist , Theodore Eck : " They would n't have agreed to a special meeting if they were n't confident of achieving some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had no trouble raising prices to sky-high levels . Now , however , the world is awash with excess crude-2 million to 3 million bbl. of unused oil per day-and the production cuts necessary to firm up the market are more than some members have so far seemed willing to bear . <P> Several cartel members are short of cash and badly need to sell every barrel of crude they can pump . One such country is Nigeria , which is burdened with a population of 80 million and a superambitious agricultural development program . In a desperate move to boost sales , the government last week threatened to slash a full $5 per bbl. off its officially quoted $36.50 price , in order to compete with non-OPEC oil from the North Sea . <P> Saudi Arabia , which produces 40% of OPEC 's oil , holds the key to any agreement that would keep prices from plunging still further . The Saudis could dry up the supply glut singlehanded by slicing their output , now at about 7.5 million bbl. per day , to 5 million bbl . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bbl. per day without dipping into capital reserves to finance a variety of ambitious construction and industrialization plans . The Saudis are also reluctant to step out on a limb within OPEC . Says Lawrence Goldstein , research director of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation : " If the Saudis cut , they have to have some indication that the rest of the organization will not simply make up the reduction in volume and take away the market share . " <P> A member like Libya , which needs cash to underwrite the grandiose political ambitions of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi , could be tempted to do just that . Libya 's production has been about 20% below its <P> December output and may fall further as a result of the Reagan Administration 's formal halt to Libyan imports last week . <P> On balance , some oilmen think that the best possible outcome of the Vienna meeting would be no agreement at all . Instead of the familiar spectacle of cartel members announcing yet another price increase , OPEC 's quarrelsome ministers may simply head home in scowling silence , sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
