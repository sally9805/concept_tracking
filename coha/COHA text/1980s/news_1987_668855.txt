No-names often become big names in pennant races . Toronto ' s John Cerutti seems ready to pass out of anonymity and step into baseball ' s spotlight . Cerutti recorded his eighth straight victory in leading the Blue Jays to a 3-2 triumph over the White Sox and Jose DeLeon Friday at Exhibition Stadium . The victory moved the Blue Jays a game and a half ahead of the second- place Detroit Tigers in the American League East and three games ahead of the Yankess . Detroit lost at Kansas City 7-5 Friday night , while Cleveland whipped the Yankees 6-5 . Cerutti ( 9-2 ) went eight innings and allowed only four hits . Tom Henke finished up in the ninth to pick up his 26th save of the season . " I don ' t know a lot about the guy , but I like him a lot , " said Sox third baseman Jerry Royster . " I ' d have to say he ' s one of the better left- handers in the league . " The rest of the American League might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Amherst . This is his first full season in the majors , and he ' s making the most of it in becoming a vital force in Toronto ' s drive for the pennant . He ' s beaten the Sox twice in the last two weeks . " I ' m feeling good , and I ' m throwing the ball well , " Cerutti said . " I ' m going after the hitters with a lot of confidence . The team ' s playing well , and I ' m getting some good defense . " Cerutti doesn ' t overpower hitters . Royster described him as a " Frank Tanana-type pitcher , who throws harder . " " He ' s got good command of his pitches , " Royster said . " He knows what to do with his stuff out there . He doesn ' t give you much to hit . If he keeps doing that , he ' ll win a lot of games . " The Sox reached Cerutti in the third , when they took a 2-0 lead . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team , lining a double to left . Gary Redus drove him home with a two-out double to left . Royster brought Redus home with a bloop single to right . The Sox couldn ' t do much with Cerutti from there . They had their best chance in the sixth , when Royster led off with a double . But with one out , Ivan Calderon popped up behind second . Royster thought the ball would drop and broke for third . Garth Iorg caught the ball , and doubled Royster at second . " I really thought the ball was going to drop , " Royster said . " It wasn ' t a smart play . " DeLeon deserved a better fate . He gave his best performance in a long time in picking up his first complete game of the year . He worked eight innings , recording eight strikeouts . More importantly , his control was as sharp as it ' s been this year . He allowed only one walk and hit two batters . But all DeLeon ( 5-11 ) had to show for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since June 20 . The Sox are only averaging three runs per game in his 11 losses . " He struggled at times , but he did a good job , " said Sox manager Jim Fregosi . " He threw the ball better than he has recently . That was the best he ' s thrown since he was involved in his car accident ( July 27 ) . " DeLeon was overpowering in the first two innings . He struck out the side in the second . But the Blue Jays overcame him in the next two innings . In the third , Toronto trimmed the Sox ' s lead on Ernie Whitt ' s two-out single up the middle that drove in Tony Fernandez . DeLeon was hit hard in the fourth when the Jays took the lead with two runs . Fred McGriff opened with a double to left-center and scored on Rance Mulliniks ' double . Willie Upshaw then connected for an RBI triple . DeLeon then settled down and gave up one more hit the rest of the way . " Except for the inning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had everything working , " said catcher Carlton Fisk . " He had them off-balance and reaching out . In the inning he got hurt , he was right down the middle. "
