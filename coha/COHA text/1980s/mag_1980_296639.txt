The number of refugees entering the U.S , has more than tripled during the past four years . The big increase started in the wake of the war in Indo-China , first with the evacuation of U.S. supporters , then the rescue of the Vietnamese boat people ( about 75% of the 62,000 Indo-Chinese admitted during fiscal 1979 ) and finally the starving fugitives from Cambodia ( about 20% of the 1979 total ) . A second large new group comes from the Soviet Union , a total of 77,000 Jews , dissidents and others since 1977 . <P> Before Castro came to power in 1959 , there were only about 50,000 Cubans living in the U.S. But the Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates that at least 750,000 Cubans have settled here over the past 20 years . Because the number is determined by those aliens who register each January , an INS spokesman admits : " We know that it is low , " It might even be as high as 1 million-with some 30,000 more new joining their ranks .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
