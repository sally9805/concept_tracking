Oklahoma City Attorney John Merritt had a problem . He had to prove that his now paralyzed client had been going only 45 m.p.h. , the legal limit , when he wrecked his car trying to avoid a county maintenance truck parked just over the crest of a hill . The defendants , owners of the truck , insisted that the driver must have been doing more than 85 m.p.h . A solution came to Merritt one day as he watched Hollywood Stunt Man Alan Gibbs put a car through a midair roll on TV . Why not have Gibbs re-enact the accident on videotape ? That was fine with Gibbs , 40 , a specialist in motorized mayhem whose credits include racing , spinning and virtually flying Burt Reynolds ' Pontiac Trans Am in the 1977 film Smokey and the Bandit . <P> Though Gibbs has not yet re-created the county truck accident , he has wrecked three $3,000 Chevrolet Vegas and a $4,300 Harley-Davidson motorcycle in the interests of Merritt 's clients . His fee : anywhere from $2,500 to $15,000 . The motorcycle case grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passenger after the vehicle went out of control . The passenger 's family retained Merritt to sue the manufacturer , claiming that the accident occurred when one side of a poorly designed handle bar gave way and the driver lost his balance . Merritt based his argument on the cycle 's skid marks . For videotaped proof , Gibbs roared around a paved cycle track , went into a long , heart-stopping skid and crashed . Harley-Davidson settled out of court for $174,000 . <P> Personal injury cases are famed in legal circles for generating splashy , new ways of highlighting evidence . Merritt 's tactic may well be copied by other plaintiffs ' lawyers-when the stakes are high enough to justify the production cost . But Merritt does have one nagging concern . <P> Though delighted with his unusual expert , he concedes , " I worry about Gibbs sometimes . I do n't want to kill him for the sake of a client . "
