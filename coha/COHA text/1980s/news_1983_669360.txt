' ' Vote for White Supremacy ! Vote Democratic ! ' ' the sign proclaimed. // Mrs. Gordon was only 13 years old at the time , but she has been an angry Republican ever since . Mrs. Gordon , you see , is black . And she has not forgotten that it was Abraham Lincoln and the Republican Party that freed the slaves and fought for generations in support of black rights. // Democrats , especially Southern Democrats , were hard at work during those years passing Jim Crow laws and keeping blacks out of the voting booth and at the back of the bus . Northern Democrats , including Franklin D. Roosevelt , didn ' t do much about it , Mrs. Gordon recalls. // There aren ' t many people left like Mrs. Gordon , even though most blacks at one time used to vote Republican . Today she is a minority within a minority . America is about 12 percent black , and only one-tenth of the country ' s black voters usually pull the GOP lever on election day. // Yet if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it is ever to shed its status as the junior partner in American politics , it must widen its appeal . And one way to do that is to reach out to blacks , Hispanics , and other fast-growing minorities. // This isn ' t a new idea . Former GOP chairman Bill Brock of Tennessee used to preach it all the time . He often went before black groups to debate his Democratic foes over which party had done more for blacks . Today , there are specialists in black affairs at both the GOP headquarters and the White House. // Yet most blacks and a majority of Hispanics remain wedded to the Democrats . And Ronald Reagan has done little to change that . Even some black Republicans have been disappointed that Reagan has done so little for them . For instance , they point out that this President has appointed no black judges to the US district courts and to date only one-fourth as many black judges to the US Court of Appeals as President Carter. // For Republicans , the situation isn ' t desperate - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to turn out in record numbers in 1984 . Many have been hurt by the recent deep recession . They have also been fired up by the winning races of black candidates for mayor in Chicago and Philadelphia . And many are thrilled with the campaign of Democrat Jesse Jackson for the party ' s presidential nomination. // At the same time , the number of Hispanic voters is rising faster than any other major ethnic group . With the exception of Cuban-Americans , Hispanic voters usually vote Democratic . And they are becoming powerful factors in Sunbelt states that the Republicans need , including California , Texas , and Florida. // Failure to tap this growing tide of new voters could nip President Reagan ' s reelection hopes . Even more important , it could put Republicans at the back of the political bus for the rest of this decade. // If one looks for solutions to all of this , it quickly becomes apparent that there are no easy answers. // Longtime Republican stalwarts such as party chairman Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. , former chairman Brock , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions . Nor do leading black Republicans like LeGree Daniels , who chairs the National Black Republican Council , or Hispanic Republicans like Rita di Martino , who chairs the New York State chapter of the Republican National Hispanic Assembly. // Mr. Sears , for instance , suggests that enlarging the pool of black Republicans is a 10-year task - something well beyond the immediate interest of party leaders more concerned about holding onto the White House next November. // Others , such as Frederic R. Kellogg , president of the Ripon Society , say that bringing blacks into the party requires basic reforms , such as changing party rules to make it easier for blacks to become convention delegates. // How did the party of Lincoln get itself into this deep hole ? A little history may be helpful here. // Until the presidency of Herbert Hoover , blacks who voted ( mostly in the North ) were as loyal to the Republicans as they were to the American flag . Pictures of Abe Lincoln hung in their homes , and the Democratic Party ( the party of white Southerners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change all that . In 1932 , when FDR ran , many blacks for the first time put an ' ' X ' ' after a Democrat ' s name on the ballot , even though Hoover still carried some black wards in big Northern cities that year . By the end of the ' 30s , the terrible experience of the depression , combined with the work and welfare benefits of Roosevelt ' s New Deal , had put half the nation ' s blacks into the Democratic Party. // Even so , many blacks - especially middle-class blacks - remained Republican . One reason , as detailed in Nancy J. Weiss ' s new book , ' ' Farewell to the Party of Lincoln : Black Politics in the Age of FDR ' ' ( Princeton University Press ) , was that the New Deal really did little for civil rights . FDR , who was more concerned with economic than social issues , was unwilling to break with tradition and battle party factions that had their roots in prejudice. // It took Harry Truman to do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dixiecrat ' ' walkout from the Democratic convention by supporting a tough civil rights plank . That was followed in the 1960s by Lyndon B. Johnson ' s civil rights crusade , after which the black switch to the Democrats was essentially complete. // What can the Republicans do now ? // Republicans suggest a number of possibilities . Among them : // Make it really pay off to be a black ( or Hispanic ) Republican . Many black leaders haven ' t forgotten that when the last Democratic president ( Jimmy Carter ) got into the White House , he quickly seemed to forget his black supporters . Some black members of Congress couldn ' t even get in to see Mr. Carter for months . Republicans could show that blacks and Hispanics who work for the GOP get rewarded in substantive ways . ( A top Republican close to President Reagan frets that after Reagan was elected , he invited a large gathering of Hispanics to the White House , with little regard as to whether they had worked for him or not . ' ' I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s no way to build a party , ' ' he says. ) // Emphasize issues of great importance to minorities . One possibility : a strong policy on urban affairs . After carefully crafting such a policy , push it very hard . Give it high visibility . Have the President and other leaders speak out on the issue frequently . Let minority voters know that Republicans are deeply concerned about the issues that worry them and use political muscle to get key minority programs through Congress. // Recognize the strengths of minorities . Most minority voters want jobs , not welfare . Offer policies that support independence , not dependence ; that support the family , not breakup of the family ; that foster morality , not a breakdown of morals . These are traditional Republican positions , and many minority voters will be naturally attracted to them if they are presented well . Appeal to the pride of blacks and Hispanics. // Keep the economy and foreign policy on track . These are the main issues to most voters , and they are vitally important to minority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if jobs are being created , if business is thriving , if inflation is under control , if the nation is at peace , all of that will play well in minority neighborhoods , just as it will anywhere else. // Yet , with all of this , the GOP is not guaranteed success. // ' ' It ' s a two-way street , ' ' chairman Fahrenkopf muses , meaning that the party can open its arms to blacks , but blacks must then give Republicans a chance to prove themselves. // Mrs. Daniels says that if blacks will take a closer look at the Republican Party , they will see much to like . Republicans ' ' foster economic independence , ' ' while Democrats foster dependence on government handouts , she argues . Democrats encourage blacks to say ' ' gim me , gim me , gim me . ' ' The Democratic approach ' ' is the politics of the ' 60s , not the politics of the ' 80s , ' ' and that ' s the message the GOP must get across in the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a Puerto Rican background , says the GOP also has a big educational job in the Hispanic community . The party needs to let people know what it stands for : conservative values , family unity , deep faith in religion , private enterprise . These qualities have appeal among Hispanics . What is needed is to spread the word so that more Hispanics understand this , she says. // Giving an urgent quality to all of this are efforts to raise voter registration sharply in coming months among blacks and Hispanics . The Jesse Jackson campaign is expected to boost the number of black ( mostly Democratic ) voters by at least several hundred thousand . Among Hispanics , a drive is under way to register 1 million new voters , with special efforts in low-income areas. // ' ' All this should be of grave concern to the Republican Party , ' ' says Mrs. di Martino. // Next : Republican strengths and weaknesses in 1984. // //
