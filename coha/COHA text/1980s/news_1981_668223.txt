How does a marathoner know he or she is eating properly ? For starters , there is the taste test . " If you ate a highly trained athlete you would find that he tastes sweeter than a sedentary person , " said Nancy Clark , a nutritionist at Sports Nutrition Associates in Brookline . Glycogen , a form of sugar stored in muscles , causes runners who eat properly to taste sweet . Glycogen , which is necessary to stamina , comes from carbohydrates in the diet . Carbohydrates come from fruit and grains . The smart runners fill up on pasta , rice , cereal , beans , bread , and fruit . The smartest ones eat high-fiber carbos , such as whole wheat bread , bran muffins and bran cereal . They add small amounts of cheese or milk , nuts and meat - foods with protein and fat . They don ' t worry about protein . " The ideal diet is carbo loaded with the right things , not fatty things , " said Clark , 29 , who has advised several top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard not to get enough protein . Two glasses of milk and four ounces of meat gives you enough . The average American gets two to three times the protein he needs . " One of my pet peeves are health food stores . They sell all sorts of protein and vitamin supplements that people simply don ' t need and can ' t use . It takes only a tiny bit more of protein to build new muscle . Resistance on the muscle , in exercise , is what makes it bigger . " I know weightlifters spending $140 a month on food . One gym owner was against my giving a workshop on nutrition because he was selling those supplements . " The only time I would recommend a supplement is if a vegetarian isn ' t getting enough iron . Even then , cooking in a cast-iron skillet can supply a lot of iron . " Ah , but the carbos , those tasty dishes . Marathoners need consistently high levels of carbos for their training , and some extra infusions are recommended two or three days and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluids is also recommended for the two or three days before the race . " It ' s better to overeat than undereat as long as you don ' t overdo it , " said Clark . " If you don ' t eat anything the day of the race it ' s okay . Mainly runners do to keep from being hungry . But you ' re already carbo-loaded and fully hydrated ( saturated with water ) . " You know if you ' re carbo-loaded if you gain weight , because when you store glycogen , you store water in roughly a one to three ratio . You know if you ' re well-hydrated if your urine is a very clear color . " If you want to drink water before the race do it 90 minutes before you start because that ' s how long it takes your kidneys to process it . You can also drink a little right before the race to have in your stomach while you ' re running . " Eating while running to restore glycogen , says Clark , is a waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but food will sit in the stomach . Water is absorbed the fastest , and drinks like ERG and Gatorade , weak sugar solutions , do a good job of restoring the blood sugar level . Coffee can benefit runners if taken at least 90 minutes before the race . " The reason for this is not that coffee is a stimulant , as most runners think , " said Clark . " Coffee helps activate SDH , an enzyme involved in burning fat . While most people do not burn off fat in exercise , runners and other long-distance atheltes do because their bodies have adapted to burning fat . So they will be burning off glycogen and fat , and coffee can help burn off the fat . " Basically , when runners hit The Wall ' at 20 miles they have used up their glycogen and they are burning fat after that . " Clark ' s thesis for her M.S. in nutrition involved studying the burning of fat while on a high-fat , low-carbo diet . " It turned out that the subjects ' bodies adapted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They didn ' t have the glycogen , which is like a spark plug to get going . " Drinking beer before a race can hurt a runners ' performance , particularly if the weather is cold . There are carbohydrates in beer , to be sure , but the alcohol can do more damage than the carbos are worth . " Alcohol is released as heat , " said Clark . " It dilates blood vessels and makes blood go to the surface of the skin . The center of the body gets chilled , and , on a cold day , your goal is to keep the core of your body warm . Alcohol is also a diuretic . You urinate that much more and dehydrate yourself . " Clark directs a final note not at marathoners but at people who turn to running to lose weight : The high-carbo diet is your ticket . " People on high-protein diets lack the energy and will to exercise because their muscles don ' t have glycogen , " said Clark . " I felt like writing a letter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was probably dehydrated from a high-protein diet in order to lose all that weight . " The only thing boxers and wrestlers can do is lose the weight well before the event , and not crash diet . Then they can load up on carbos . " Clark has written a book , " The Athlete ' s Kitchen .
