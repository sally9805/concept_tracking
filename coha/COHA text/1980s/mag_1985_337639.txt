Move over , La Pasionaria . Amy Carter has mounted the barricades . The 17-year- old daughter of former President Jimmy Carter was arrested last week when she formally trespassed on the grounds of South Africa 's embassy in Washington , D.C. The youngest Carter human rights campaigner was searched and handcuffed , then released after being held for less than an hour by Washington police . Like the more than 1,800 other protesters arrested at the embassy , she will not be prosecuted . Now a high school student in Atlanta , Amy had called home beforehand to inform her mother of her plans but not to seek parental consent . Human rights , after all , begin at home .
