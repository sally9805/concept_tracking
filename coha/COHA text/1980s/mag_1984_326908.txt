William Butler Yeats tells of Icelandic peasants who found a skull in a cemetery and suspected it might be that of the poet Egill . " Its great thickness made them feel certain it was , " he writes , but " to be doubly sure they put it on a wall and hit it hard blows with a hammer . " When it did not break , " they were convinced that it was in truth the skull of the poet and worthy of every honor . " <P> The human propensity to test the worthiness of a thing by seeing how well it stands up to abuse-the instinct to kick the tires on a used car-is an ancient and , if Yeats is to be trusted , occasionally charming habit . It can also be painful . Trial by ordeal , the venerable and once widespread practice by which fire or poison or some other divining element is used to determine a person 's guilt or innocence , is the kick-to-test instinct applied to living subjects . It used to be a popular method for deciding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the practice lacked in fairness ( the ancient Hindus tied a bag of cayenne pepper around the head of an accused witch , and suffocation was the only proof of innocence ) it made up for in finality . <P> We have come a long way since those dark days . Or have we ? We no longer pick our witches or our poets this way , but that is because moderns have little interest in either . When it comes to things they are interested in-doctors , lawyers , Presidents-they have replaced skull-bashing and suffocation with more subtle ordeals . Aspiring doctors must first survive the pressure cooker of a sleepless year of internship , aspiring lawyers the cutthroat paper chase of first-year law school . And those who aspire to the most exalted title of all , President , are required to traverse a campaign trail of Homeric peril . Its length is ludicrous : three years for any serious candidate ; its requirements absurd : giving up privacy , often family and almost always a job ( " You have to be unemployed to run for President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves the Senate in January and is pondering a run for the presidency in 1988 ) ; and its purpose obscure : posing with funny hats has , on the face of it , little to do with the subject at hand , namely , governing . <P> The ritual seems strange . Things just are n't done that way any more . Not even in Chad , where ten years ago President Ngarta Tombalbaye ordered all high government officials to undergo Yondo , a sometimes fatal initiation ritual combining physical abuse ( e.g. , flogging , mock burial ) with ingeniously gruesome tests of stamina ( e.g. , crawling naked through a nest of termites ) . For his pains , Tombalbaye was assassinated within a year , and his people danced in the streets . Americans bear their burdens with better humor . They show no inclination to deal nearly so decisively with , say , the Hubert Humphrey test of presidential toughness . Humphrey once questioned whether Walter Mondale had the " fire in the belly " to run for President , a charge so serious that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet of rubber chicken and occasional crow . Mondale may have other political liabilities , but the absence of a burning belly is no longer one of them .
