idea , and your uneasiness is being caused by having to fight the Council with no real reasons to give them . " " Bless you  --  that 's exactly what it must be ! I 've been feeling for the past two months as if I were trying to bail a leaky boat with my bare hands ! " " So use Elspeth 's youth and the fact that she has to finish her training as an excuse to stall for a while . I 'll back you ; when Kyril and Elcarth see that I 'm backing you , they 'll follow my lead , " Talia said with more confidence than she actually felt . " Remember , I have a full vote in the Council now . Between the two of us we have the power to veto even the vote of the full Council . All it takes is the Monarch and Queen 's Own to overturn a Council vote . I 'll admit it is n't politic : to do so , but I 'll do it if I have to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever managed all these years without you ? " " Very well , thank you . If I had n't been here , I expect you 'd have managed to stall them somehow  --  even if you had to resort to Devan physicking Elspeth into a phony fever to gain time ! Now , is n't it time to make our entrance ? " " Indeed it is . " Selenay smiled , with just a hint of maliciousness . " And this is a moment I have long waited for ! There are going to be some cases of chagrin when certain folk realize you are Queen 's Own in truth , vote and all , and that the full Council will be in session from now on ! " They rose together and entered the huge , brass-mounted double doors of the Council chamber . The other members of the Council had assembled at the table ; they stood as one as the Queen entered the room , with Talia in her proper position as Queen 's Own , one step behind her and slightly to her right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had only the horseshoe Council table and the chairs surrounding it as furnishings , all of a dark wood that age and much handling had turned nearly black . Like the rest of the Palace , it was paneled only halfway in wood ; the rest of the room , from about chin-height to the ceiling , being the gray stone of the original Palace-keep . A downscaled versionof Selenay 's throne was placed at the exact center of the Counciltable , behind it was the fireplace , and over the fireplace , the arms of the Monarch of Valdemar ; a winged , white horse with broken chains about its throat . On the wall over the door , the wall that her throne faced , was an enormous map of Valdemar inscribed on heavyp501linen and kept constantly up-to-date ; it was so large that any memberof the Council could read the lettering from his or her seat . The work was exquisite , every road and tiny village carefully delineated . The chair to the immediate right of the Queen 's was Talia 's ; to the immediate left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seneschal sat Kyril , to Talia 's right , the Lord Marshal . The rest of the Councillors took whatever seat they chose , without regard for rank . Talia had never actually used her seat until this moment ; by traditionit had to remain vacant until she completed her training and was a full Herald . She had been seated with the rest of the Councillorsand had done nothing except voice an occasional opinion when asked , and give her observations to Selenay when the meetings were over . While her new position brought her considerable power , it also carried considerable responsibility . The Councillors remained standing , some with visible surprise on their faces ; evidently word of her return had not spread as quickly through the Court as it had through the Collegium . Selenay took her place before her chair , as did Talia . The Queen inclined her head slightly to either side , then sat , with Talia sitting a fraction of a second later . The Councillors took their own seats when the Queen and Queen 's Own were in their places . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion of the marriageenvoy from Alessandar , " Selenay said quietly , to the open surprise of several of her Councillors . Talia nodded to herself ; by taking the initiative , Selenay started the entire proceedings with herself on the high ground . One by one each of those seated at the table voiced their own opinions ; as Selenay had told Talia , they were uniformly in favor of it , most desiring that the match be made immediately . Talia began taking stock of the Councillors , watching them with an intensity she had never felt before . She wanted to evaluate them without using her Gift , only her eyes and ears . First was Lord Gartheser , who spoke for the North  --  Orthallen 's closest ally , without a doubt . Thin , nervous , and balding , he punctuatedhis sentences with sharp movements of his hands . Though he never actually looked directly at Orthallen , Talia could tell by the way he oriented himself that his attention was so bound on Orthallenthat no one else made any impression on him at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a rather thin and reedy voice , " that this betrothal would bring us an alliance so strong that no one would ever dare dream of attacking us again . With Ales/sandar 's army ready to spring to our rescue , not even Karse would care to trifle with us . I venture to predict that even the Border raids would cease , and our Borders would be truly secure for the first time in generations . " Orthallen nodded , so slightly that Talia would not have noticed the motion if she had not been watching him . And she was n't the only one who caught that faint sign of approval . Gartheser had been watching for it , too . Talia saw him nod and smile slightly in response . Elcarth and Kyril were next ; Elcarth perched on the edge of his chair and looking like nothing so much as a gray snow-wren , and Kyril as nearly motionless as an equally gray granite statue . " I can see no strong objections , " Elcarth said , his head slightly to one side , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training and her internship before any such alliance is consummated . " " And Prince Ancar must be of a suitable temperament , " Kyril added smoothly . " This Kingdom  --  forgive me , Highness  --  this Kingdomhas had the bitter experience of having a consort who was not suitable . I , for one , have no wish to live through another such expe-rience . " Lady Wyrist spoke next , who stood for the East ; another of Orthallen'ssupporters . This plump , fair-haired woman had been a great beauty in her time , and still retained charm and magnetism . " I am totally in favor  --  and I do not think this is the time to daily ! Let the betrothal be as soon as possible  --  the wedding , even ! Trainingcan wait until after alliances are irrevocable . " She glared at Elcarthand Kyril . " It 's my Border the Karsites come rampaging over whenever they choose . My people have little enough , and the Karsitesregularly reive away what little they have ! But it is also my Border that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I can see nothing to find fault with . " White-haired , snowy-bearded Father Aldon , the Lord Patriarch , spoke up wistfully . " As my Lady has said , this alliance promises peace , a peace such as we have not enjoyed for far too long . Karse would be forced to sue for a lasting peace , faced with unity all along two of its borders . Renewing our long friendship with Hardorn can only bring a truer peace than we have ever known . Though the Heir is young , many of our ladies have wedded younger still  --  " " Indeed . " Bard Hyron , so fair-haired that his flowing locks were nearly white , was speaker for the Bardic Circle . He echoed Fatherp503Aldon 's sentiments . " It is a small sacrifice for the young woman to make , in the interests of how much we would gain . " Talia noted dubiously that his pale gray eyes practically glowed silver when Orthallen nodded approvingly . The thin and angular Healer Myrim , spokeswoman for her Circle , was not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoyed by Hyron 's hero worship ; and something about Orthallen seemed to be setting her ever so slightly on edge . " You all forget something  --  though the child has been Chosen , she is not yet a Herald , and the law states clearly that the Monarch must be a Herald . There has never been a reason strong enough to overturn that law before , and I fail to see the need to set such a dangerous precedent now ! " " Exactly , " Kyril murmured . " The child is just that ; a child . Not ready to rule by any stretch of the imagination , with much to learn before she is . Nevertheless , I am  --  cautiously  --  in favor of the betrothal . But only if the Heir remainsat the Collegium until after her full training is complete . " Somewhat to Talia 's surprise , Lord Marshal Randon shared Myrim 's mild dislike of Orthallen . Talia wondered , as she listened to that scarred and craggy warrior measuring out his words with the care and deliberation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd been gone to so change him . For when she 'd last sat at the Council board , Randon had been one of Orthallen'sforemost supporters . Now , however , though he favored the betrothal , he stroked his dark beard with something like concealed annoyance , as if it galled him , having to agree with Orthallen 's party . Horselike Lady Kester , speaker for the West , was short and to the point . " I 'm for it , " she said , and sat herself down . Plump and softspokenLord Gildas for the South was equally brief . " I can see nothing to cause any problems , " said Lady Cathan of the Guilds quietly . She was a quiet , gray , dovelike woman , of an outer softness that masked a stubborn inner core . " And much that would benefit every member of the Kingdom . " " That , I think , is a good summation , " Lord Palinor , the Seneschal , concluded . " You know my feelings on the matter . Majesty ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but totally noncommittal , until everyone had spoken except herself and her Herald.  |p504Now  she leaned forward slightly , and addressed them , a hint of command tingeing her voice . " I have heard you all ; you each favor the match , and all of your reasons are good ones . You even urge me to agree to the wedding and see it consummated within the next few months . Very well ; I can agree with every one of your arguments , and I am more than willing to return Alessandar 's envoy with word that we will be consideringhis offer with all due gravity . But one thing I can not and will not do  --  I will never agree to anything that will interrupt Elspeth'straining . That , above all other considerations , must be continued ! Lady forbid it , but should I die , we can not risk the throne of Valdemar in the keeping of an untrained Monarch ! Therefore I will do no more than indicate to Alessandar that his suit is welcome  --  and inform him in no uncertain terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internship . " " Majesty ! " Gartheser jumped to his feet as several more Councillorsstarted speaking at once ; one or two growing angry . Talia stood then , and rapped the table , and the babble ceased . The argumentive ones stared at her as though they had forgotten her presence . " My lords , my ladies  --  forgive me , but any arguments you may have are moot . My vote goes with the Queen 's decision . I have so advised her . " It was fairly evident from their dumbfounded expressions that they had forgotten that Talia now carried voting rights . If the situationhad not been so serious , Talia would have derived a great deal of amusement from some of the dumbfounded expressions  --  Orthallen'sin particular . " If that is the advice of the Queen 's Own , then my vote must follow , " Kyril said quickly , although Talia could almost hear him wondering if she really knew what she was doing . " And mine , " Elcarth seconded , looking and sounding much more confident of Talia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence so deep one could almost hear the dust motes that danced in the light from the clerestory windows falling to the floor . " It seems , " said Lord Gartheser , the apparent leader of those dissenting , " that we are outvoted . " Faint grumbling followed his words . At the farthest end of the table , a white-haired lord rose ; the faint grumbling ceased . This gentleman was the one Talia had been watching so closely , and the only one who had not spoken . Orthal/len ; Lord of Wyvern 's Reach , and Kris ' uncle . He was the most seniorCouncillor , for he had served Selenay 's father . He had served Selenay as well , throughout her entire reign . Selenay often called him " Lord Uncle , " and he had been something of a father-figure to Elspeth . He was highly regarded and respected . But Talia had never been able to warm to him . Part of the reason was because of what he had attempted to do to Skif . While he did not have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had tried to have the boy sent away for two years ' punishment duty with the Army . His ostensible reason was the number of infractions of the Collegium rules Skif had managed to acquire , culminating with catching him red-handed in the office of the Provost-Marshal late one night . Orthallen had claimed Skif was there to alter the Misdemeanor Book . Talia , who had asked him to go there , was the only one who knew he had broken into the office to investigate Hulda 's records . He was going to try to see who , exactly , had sponsoredher into the Kingdom , in an attempt to ferret out the identity of her co-conspirator . Talia had saved her friend at the cost of a lie , saying that she had asked him to find out whether her Holderkin relatives were claimingthe Privilege Tax allowed those who had produced a child Chosen . Since that time she had been subtly , but constantly , at loggerheadswith Orthallen ; when she first began sitting on the Council it seemed as if he had constantly moved to negate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many of her observations ( on the grounds of her youth and inexperience ) that she had very seldomspoken up when he was present . He always seemed to her to be just a little too careful and controlled . When he smiled , when he frowned , the expression never seemed to go any deeper than the skin . At first she had chided herself for her negative reaction to him , putting it down to her irrational fear of males ; handsome males in particular , for even though past his prime , he was a strikingly handsome man  --  there was no doubt which side of Kris ' family had blessed him with his own angelic face . And there was no sin in being a trifle cold , emotionally speaking , yet for some reason , she was always reminded of the wyvern that formed his crest when she saw him . Like the wyvern , he seemed to her to be thin-blooded , calculating , and quite ruthless  --  and hiding it all beneath an attractivelybejeweled skin.  |p506But  there was more to her mistrust of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect that he was the source of those rumors about her misusing her Gift , and she was certain that he had started them because he knew how such vile rumors would affect an Empath who was well-known to have a low sense of self-esteem . She was equally certain that he had deliberately planted doubts in Kris ' mind  --  knowing that she would feel those doubts and respond . But this time she had cause to be grateful to him ; when Orthallen spoke , the rest of the Councillors paid heed , and he spoke now in favor of the Queen 's decision . " My lords , my ladies  --  the Queen is entirely correct , " he said , surprising Talia somewhat , for he had been one of those most in favor of marrying  --  speth off with no further ado . " We have only one Heir , and no ot her candidates in the direct line . We should not take such a risk . The Heir must be trained ; I see the wisdom of that , now . I withdraw my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monarch , and will surely be more than willing to make preliminary agreements on the strength of a betrothal promisedfor the future . In such ways , we shall have all the benefits of both plans . " Talia was not the only member of the Council surprised by Orthallen'sapparent about-face . Hyron stared as if he could not believe what he had heard . The members of his faction and those opposed to him seemed equally taken aback . The result of this speech was the somewhat reluctant  --  though unanimous  --  vote of the Council to deal with the envoy just as Selenay had outlined . The vote was , frankly , little more than a gesture , since together Selenay and Talia could overrule the entire Council . But though the unanimous backing of her stance gave Selenay a position of strong moral advantage , Talia wondered what private conversations would be taking place when the Council sessionconcluded  --  and who would be involved . The remaining items on the Council 's agenda were routine and mundane ; rescinding tax for several villages hard hit by spring floods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evendim in the hope of making life difficult enough this year that the pirates and raiders would decide to turn to easier prey , the finingof a merchant-clan that had been involved in the slave-trade . The arguments about just how many troops should be moved to Lake Evendim and who would fund the deployment went on for hours . The Lord Marshal and Lady Kester ( who ruled the district ofp507the fisherfolk of the lake ) were unyielding in their demands for the extra- troops ; Lord Gildas and Lady Cathan , whose rich grainlands and merchant-guilds would supply the taxes for the primary supportof the effort , were frantic in their attempts to cut down the numbers . Talia 's sympathy lay with the fisherfolk , yet she could find it in her heart to feel for those who were being asked to delve into their pockets for the pay and provisioning of extra troops who would mostly remain idle . It seemed that there was no way to compromise , and that the arguments would continue with no conclusion . That would be no solution for the fisherfolk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out figures concerning the numbers needed to keep watch along the winding coastlines , a glimmeringof an idea came to her . " Forgive me , " she spoke into one of the sullen silences . " I know little of warfare , but I know something of the fisherfolk . Only the young , healthy , and whole go out on the boats in season ; unless my memory is incorrect , the old , the very young , pregnant women , those minding the young children for the rest of the family , and the crippled remain in the temporary work-villages . Am I right ? " " Aye  --  and that 's what makes these people so damned hard to defend ! " the Lord Marshal growled . " There is n't a one left behind with the ability to take arms ! " " Well , according to your figures , a good third of your troopers would be spending all their time on coastwatch . Since you 're going to have to be feeding that many people anyway , why not provision the dependents instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freed from having to see to their day-to-day food supplies , they 'll have the time for it , and what does a watcher need besides a pair of good eyes and the means to set an alert ? " " You mean use children as coastwatchers ? " Gartheser exclaimed . " That  --  that 's plainly daft ! " " Just you wait one moment , Gartheser , " Myrim interjected . " I fail to see what 's daft about it . It seems rare good sense to me . " " But  --  how are they to defend themselves ? " " Against what ? Who 's going to see them ? They 'll be hidden , man , in blinds , the way coastwatchers are always hidden . And I see the girl 's drift . Puttin ' them up would let us cut down the deployment by a third , just as Gildas and Cathan want , " Lady Kester exclaimed , looking up like an old gray warhorse hearing the bugles . " Ye 'd still have to provision the full number , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd not have to pay ' em , " one of the others chuckled . " But  --  children ? " Hyron said doubtfully . " How can we put children in that kind of vital position ? What 's to keep them from runningoff to play ? " " Border children are not very childlike , " Talia said quietly , looking to Kester , and the Speaker for the West nodded emphatic agreement . " Silverhair , lad , the only thing keepin ' these children off the boats is size , " Kester snorted , though not unkindly . " They 're not your soft highborns ; they 've been working since their hands were big enough to knot a net . " " Aye , I must agree . " Lady Wyrist entered this argument for the first time . " I suspect your fisherfolk are not unlike my HolderkinasHerald T'alia can attest , Border-bred children have little time for childish pursuits . " " All the more chance that they 'll run off , then , " Hyron insisted . " Not when they 've seen whole families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching for , " said Myrim . " I served out there . I 'd trust the sense of any of those children ' before I 'd trust the sense of some highborn graybeards I could name . " " Well said , lady ! " Kester applauded , and turned sharp eyes on the Lord Marshal . " Tell ye what else , ye old wardog  --  an ' ye can persuade these troopers of yours to turn to and lend a hand to a bit of honest work now and again  --  " " Such as ? " The Lord Marshal almost cracked a smile . " Taking the landwork ; drying the fish and the sponge , mending the nets and lines , packing and crating , readying the longhouses for winter . " " It might be possible ; what were you planning to offer ? " " War-pay ; with the landwork off my people 's hands , and knowing their folk on land are safe , we should be able to cover the extra bonus ourselves , and still bring in a proper profit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage it . " " Done , then . How say you , Cathan , Gildas ? " They were only too happy to agree . The Council adjourned on this most positive note . Selenay and Talia stood as one , and preceded the rest out ; Kyril a pace behind them . " You have been learning , have n't you ? " Kyril said in Talia 's ear . " Me ? " " Yes , you ; and do n't play the innocent . " Elcarth joined his colleagueas they stood in a white-clad knot outside the Council Cham/ber door , waiting for Selenay to finish conferring with the Seneschal on the agenda for the afternoon 's audiences . He pushed a lock of gray hair out of his eyes and smiled . " That was cleverly done , gettingthe Border Lords on your side . " " It was the only way to get a compromise going . Cathan and Gildas would have agreed to anything that saved them money . With the Borderers and those two , we had a majority , and everybody benefited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of invoking Bordererpride , really ; we 're proud of how tough we are , even as Tit-tles . " " Lovely . Truly lovely . " Selenay joined them . " All those sessions of dealing with hardheaded Borderers in the middle of feuds taught you more than a little ! Now tell me this ; what would you have done if you had n't absorbed all that fisherfolk lore from Keren , Teren , and Sherrill ? Sat dumb ? " " I do n't think so , not when it was obvious that there 'd never be agreement . " Talia thought for a moment . " I think . . . if one of youhad n't done so first . . . I would have suggested an adjournment until we could dig up an expert on the people of the area , preferably a Herald who has done several circuits there . " " Fine  --  that 's what I was about to do when you spoke up ; we arebeginning to think as a team . Now I have a working lunch with Kyriland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so you can go find something to gulp down at the Collegium . At one I have formal audiences , and you have to be there . Those will last about three hours ; you 're free then until seven and Court dinner . After dinner , unless something comes up , you 're free again . " " But Alberich is expecting you at four  --  " Elcarth grinned at Talia 's groan . "  --  and Devan at five . Welcome home , Talia ! " " Well , " she said with a sigh , " It 's better than shoveling snow , I guess ! But I never thought I 'd begin missing field work so soon ! " " Missing field work already ? " Talia turned to find Kris standing behind her , an insolent grin on his face . " I thought you told me you 'd never miss field work ! " She grinned back . " I lied . " " No ! " He feigned shock . " Well , what of the Council meeting ? " She wanted to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  who his uncle was . Anything she told him would quite likely get back to Orthallen , and Kris would be telling Orthallenin all innocence , never dreaming he was handing the man weaponsto use against her by doing so.  |p510  " Oh  --  nothing much , " she said reluctantly . " The betrothal 's being held off until Elspeth 's finished training . Look , Kris , I 'm sorry , but I 'm rather short on time right now . I 'll tell you later , all right ? " And she fled before he could ask anything more . Lunch was a few bites snatched on the run between the Palace and her room ; audiences required a slightly more formal uniform than the one she 'd worn to the Council session . Talia managed to wash , change , and get back in time to discuss the scheduled audiences with the Seneschal . Talia 's role here was as much bodyguard as anything else , although her duties included assessing the emotional state of those coming before the Queen and giving her any information that seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same gray graniteand dark wood as the rest of the old Palace . Selenay 's throne was on a raised platform at the far end . Behind the throne the wall had been carved into the Royal arms ; there were no curtains for assassinsto hide behind . The Queen 's Own spent the entire time positionedbehind the throne to the Queen 's right , from which position the Queen could hear her least whisper . Petitioners had to travel the length of the chamber , giving Talia ample time to " read " their emotionalstate if she thought it necessary to do so . The audiences were quite unexciting ; petitioners ranged from a smallholder seeking permission to establish a Dyer 's Guildhouse on his property to two noblemen who had called challenge on each other and were now trying desperately to find a way out of the situation without either of them losing face . Not once did she deem the situation grave enough to warrant " reading " any of them . When the audience session concluded , Talia sprinted back to her room to change into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Walking into the salle was like walking into the past ; nothing had changed , not the worn , backless benches against the wall , not the clutter of equipment and towels on and beneath the benches , not the light coming from the windows . Not even Alberich had changed so much as a hair ; he still wore the same old leathers , or clothing like enough to have been the same . His scar-seamed face still looked as incapable of humor as the walls of the Palace ; his long black hair held neither more nor less gray than it had the last time Talia had seen him . Elspeth was already there , going full out against Jeri under Alber/ich 's critical eye . Talia held her breath in surprise ; Elspeth was , ( to her judgment , at least ) Jeri 's equal . The young weapons instructor was not holding anything back , and more than once only saved herself from a " kill " by frantically wrenching her body out of the way of the wooden blade . Both of them were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do well , children ; both of you , " Alberich nodded as he spoke . Both Elspeth and Jeri began walking slowly in little circles to keep their muscles from stiffening , while drying their faces with old towels . " Jeri , it is more work you need on your defense ; working with the students has made you sloppy . Elspeth , if it was that you were not far busier than any student should be , I would make you Jeri 's assistant . " Elspeth raised her head , and Talia could see she was flushed with the praise , her eyes glowing . " However , you are very far from perfect . Your left side is too weak and you are vulnerable there . From now on you are to work lefthanded , using your right only when I tell you , to keep frorn losing your edge . Enough for today , off to the bath with you  --  it is like your Companions you smell ! " He turned to Talia , who bit her lip , then said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " In trouble ? It is possible  --  " Alberich scowled ; then unexpectedlysmiled . " No fear , little Talia ; it is that I am well aware how few were the chances for you to keep in practice . Today we will start slowly , and I will determine just how much you have lost . Tomorrowyou will be in trouble . " Talia was thanking the gods an hour later that Kris had insisted they both keep in fighting trim as much as possible . Alberich was reason- ' ably pleased that she had lost so little edge , and kept his cutting remarks to a minimum . Nor was she the recipient of more than one or two bruising thwacks from his practice blade when she 'd done something exceptionally stupid . On the whole , she felt as if she 'd gotten off very lightly . Another run , this time to wash and change yet again , and she was back at Healer 's Collegium , going over the past eighteen months with Devan and Rynee . Both were blessedly succinct ; there had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with among the Heraldic Circle . As a result , Talia was able to flee to Compan/ion 's Field just as the warning bell for supper sounded at the Herald'sCollegium . Rolan was waiting at the fence , and she pulled herself onto his back without bothering with going for a saddle . " I think , " she told him , as he walked off into a quiet copse , " that I may die of exhaustion . This is worse than when I was a student . " He lipped her booted foot affectionately ; Talia picked up a projectionof reassurance and something to do with time . " You think I 'll get used to it in a few days ? Lord , I hope so ! Still  --  " She thought hard , trying to remember just what the Queen 's schedule was like . " Hm . Council sessions are n't more than three times a week . Audiences , though , they 're every day . Alberich will torture me every day , too . But I could reschedule , say , Devan before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just before dinner , so I 'm only changing twice a day . You , my darling , whenever I can squeeze a free moment . " Rolan made a sound very like laughing . " True , with the tight bond we have , I do n't have to be with you physically , do I ? What did you think of the audiences ? " To Talia 's delight , he hung his head and did a credible imitation of a human snore . " You , too ? Lord and Lady , they 're as bad as State banquets ! Why did I ever think being a Herald would be exciting ? " Rolan snorted , and projected the memory of their flight across country to get help for the plague-stricken village of Waymeet , followingthat with the fight with the raiders that had attacked and fired Hevenbeck . " You 're right ; I think I can live with boredom . What do you think of how Elspeth 's coming along ? " To her surprise , Rolan was faintly worried , but could give her no clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important enough to trance down to where you can give me a clearer idea ? " He shook his head , mane brushing her face a little . " Well , in that case , we 'll let it go . It 's probably just the usual rebelliousness  --  and I ca n't say as I blame her . Her schedule is as bad as mine . I do n't like it , and I ca n't fault her if she does n't ei-ther . " Talia dismounted beside a tiny , spring-fed pool , and sat in the grass , watching the sun set , and emptying her mind . Rolan stoodp513beside her , both of them content with a quiet moment in which to simply be together . " Well , I 'm into it at last , " she said , half to herself . " I thought I 'd never make it , sometimes . . . . This had been the first day she had truly been Queen 's Own  --  with all the duties and all the rights ; from the right to overrule the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one she had n't exercised , and still was n't sure she had the nerve for ! ) ; from her duty to ease the fears of her fellows in the Circle to the duty to see to the Heir 's well-being . It was a frightening moment in a way , and a sobering one . On reflection , it almost seemed as if the Queen 's Own best served the interests of Queen and country by not being too forward ; by saving her votes for the truly critical issues and keeping her influence mostly to the quiet word in the Queen 's ear . That suited Talia ; she had n't much enjoyed having all eyes on her this afternoon  --  especiallynot Orthallen 's . But Selenay had been more at ease just becauseTalia was there ; there had been no mistaking that . In the long run , that was what the job was all about  --  giving the Monarch one completely honest and completely trustworthy friend . . . . The dying sun splashed scarlet and gold on the bottoms of the few clouds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deepened from blue to purple , and the Hounds , the two stars that chased the sun , shone in unwinking splendor . The tops of the clouds took on the purple of the sky as the sun dropped below the horizon , and the purple tinge soaked through them like water being taken into a sponge . The light faded , and everything began to lose color , fading into cool blues . Little frogs began to sing in the pool at Talia 's feet ; night-blooming jacinth flowers opened somewhere near her , and the cooling breeze picked up the perfume and carried it to her . And just when she was feeling totally disinclined to move , a mosquitobit her . " Ouch ! Damn ! " She slapped at the offending insect , then laughed . " The gods remind me of my duty . Back to work for me , love . Enjoy your evening . "  |p514AS  IF THAT TINY INSECT BITE HAD BEEN AN OMEN , THINGS BEGAN TO GO WRONG , starting with the weather . The perfect spring turned sour ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain was cold and steadily dismal . The sun , when Talia actually saw it , gave a chill , washed-out light . Miserable , that was what it was ; miserable and depressing . The few flowers that managed to bloom seemed dispirited , and hung limply on their stems . The damp crept into everything , and fires on the hearths all day and all night did little to drive it out . The whole Kingdom was affected ; there were new tales reaching the Court every day of flooding , sometimes in areas that had n't flooded in a hundred years or more . This was bound to have an effect on the Councillors . They worked like heroes at all hours to cope with emergencies , but the grim atmospheremade them quarrelsome and inclined to snipe at each other at the least opportunity . Every Council session meant at least one major fight and two ruffled tempers to be soothed . The names they called each other would have been ample cause for dueling anywhere else . At least they treated Talia with that same lack of respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that was a positive sign , that she had been accepted as one of them , and their equal . The sniping-among-equals was something she could cope with ,  |p515though  it was increasingly difficult to keep her temper when everyonearound her was losing theirs . Far harder to deal with in any rational way were Orthallen 's subtle attempts at undercutting her authority . Clever , those attempts were ; frighteningly clever . He never said anything that anyone could directly construe as criticism ; no , what he did was hint  --  oh , so politely , and at every possibleopportunity  --  that perhaps she was a bit young and inexperiencedfor her post . That she might be going overboard because of the tendency of youth to see things always in black and white . That she surely meant well , but . . . and so on . It made Talia want to scream and bite something . There was no way to counteract him except to be even more reasonable and mild-tempered than he . She felt as if she were standing on sand , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Things were not going all that well between herself and Kris either . " Goddess , Talia , " Kris groaned , slumping back into his chair . " He 's just doing what he sees as his duty ! " Talia counted to ten , slowly , counted the Library bookshelves , then counted the rings of the knothole in the table in front of her . " He was claiming I was overreacting at the same time that Lady Kester was calling Hyron a pompous peabrain at the tole of her lungs ! " " Well  --  " " Kris , he 's said the same damn things every Council session and at least three times during each session ! Every time it looks as if the other Councillors are beginning to listen to what I 'm saying , he trots out the same speech ! " She shoved her chair away from the table , and began pacing restlessly , up and down the length of the vacant Library . This had been a particularly bad session , and the muscles of her neck felt as tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything at all sinister in my uncle 's behavior  --  " " Dammit , Kris  --  " " Talia he 's old , he 's set in his ways  --  you 're frighteningly young to him , and likely to usurp his position ! Have some pity on the man , he 's only human ! " " So what am I ? " She struggled not to shout , but the argument was giving her a headache . " I 'm supposed to like what he 's doing ? " " He 's not doing anything ! " Kris scowled , as if he had a headache ,  |p516too  . " Frankly , I think you 're hearing insult and seeing peril that is n't there . " Talia turned abruptly , and stared at him , tight-lipped , fists clenched . " In that case , " she replied , after a dozen slow , careful breaths of dust-laden air , " maybe I should take my irrational fantasieselsewhere . " " But  --  " She turned again and all but ran down the staircase . He called something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and ran on . So now they did n't talk about much of anything anymore . And Talia missed that ; missed the closeness they used to have , the way they used to be able to confide their deepest secrets to each other . Truth to be told , she missed that more than the physical side of their relationship  --  though now that she was no longer used to being celibateshe missed that , too . . . . Then there was her relationship  --  or more accurately , lack of one  --  with Dirk . His behavior was baffling in the extreme ; one moment he would seem determined to get her alone somewhere , the next , he shied away from even being in the same room . He would be lurking in the background everywhere she went for a day or two , then just as abruptly would vanish , only to reappear in a few days . Half the time he seemed determined to throw Kris at her , the other half , equally determined to block Kris from getting anywhere near herTalia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was staring , broodingly , off into the far distance . For a wonder , it was n't raining , although the sky was a dead , dull gray and threatening to pour any moment . " Dirk ? " He jumped , whipped about , and stared at her with wide , startled eyes . " W-what are you doing here ? " he asked , somewhat ungraciously , his back pressed hard against the fence as if that barrier was all that was keeping him from running away . " The same as you , probably , " Talia replied , forcing herself not to snap at him . " Looking for my Companion , and maybe somebody to ride with . "  |p517  " In that case , should n't you be looking for Kris ? " he asked , his expression twisted as if he 'd swallowed something very unpleasant . She could n't think of a reply , and chose not to answer him . Insteadshe moved to the fence herself , and stood with one booted foot on the first railing and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had held when she saw him . " Talia  --  " He took one step toward her  --  she heard his boot squelch in the wet grass  --  then stopped . " I  --  Kris is  --  a very valuable friend . More than friend . I  --  " She waited for him to say what was on his mind , hoping that this time he 'd finish it . Maybe if she did n't look at him , he 'd be able to speak his piece . " Yes ? " she prompted when the silence went on so long she 'd almost suspected him of sneaking away . She turned to catch his blue , blue eyes staring almost helplessly at her before he hastily averted them . " I  --  I 've got to go  --  " he gasped , and fled . She was ready to scream with frustration . This was the fourth time he 'd pulled this little trick , starting to say something , then running away . And with things somewhat at odds between herself and Kris , she really did n't feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides , she had n't seen Kris much since their last little set-to . With an exasperated sigh she Mindcalled Rolan . They both needed exercise  --  and he , at least , would be a sympathetic listener . Kris was avoiding Talia on purpose . When he 'd first returned , his uncle had taken time out to give him familial greetings ; that was only to be expected . But Orthallen lately seemed to be going out of his way to speak to his nephew two or three times a week , and the conversation somehow always turned to Talia . Not by accident , either . Kris was mortally sure of that . Nor were they pleasant conversations , though they seemed to be on the surface . Kris was beginning to get an impression that Orthallenwas looking for something  --  weaknesses in the Queen 's Own , perhaps . Certainly , whenever he happened to say something complimentaryabout Talia , his uncle would always insinuate a " Yes , but surely . . . " in a rather odd and confiding tone . Like the latest example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultation with Elcarth aboutp518some of his latest Farseeing pupils , when Orthallen had just " happened " to intercept him . " Nephew ! " Orthallen had hailed him , " I have word from your brother  --  " " Is anything wrong ? " Kris had asked anxiously . The family holdingswere in the heart of some of the worst flooding in a generation . " Does he need me at home ? I 'll be free in a few weeks  --  " " No , no ; things are far from well , but it 's not an emergency yet . The smallholders have lost about a tenth of their fields , in total ; obviously some are worse off than others . They 've lost enough livestockthat the spring births are barely going to make up for the losses  --  oh , and your brat our lost one of his Shin'a'in cross-bred stal-lions . " " Damn  --  he 's not going to find another one of those in a hurry . Are we needing any outside help ? " " Not yet . There 's enough grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted you to know exactly how things stood , so that you would n't worry . " " Thank you , Uncle . I appreciate your taking the time to let me know . " " And is your young protegee settling in , do you think ? " he then asked smoothly . " What with all the emergencies that have come up lately , I wonder if she has more than she can cope with , some-times . " " Havens , Uncle , I 'm the last one to ask , " Kris had said with a little impatience . " I hardly see her anymore . We both have duties , and those duties do n't let us cross paths too often . " " Oh ? Somehow I had gotten the impression that you Heralds alwaysknew what was happening in each others ' lives . " Kris really had n't been able to think of a response to that ; at least not a respectful one . " I only asked because I thought she looked a bit careworn , and I thought perhaps she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his cold eyes boring into Kris ' . " She has a heavy burden of responsibility for one so young . " " She 's equal to it , Uncle . I 've told you that before . Rolan would n't have Chosen her otherwise . " " Well , I 'm sure you 're correct , " Orthallen replied , sounding as if he meant the opposite . " Those rumors of her using her Gift to ma-nipulate  --  " " Were absolutely unfounded . I told you that . She has been sop519circumspect in even reading others that she practically has to be forced to it  --  " Kris broke off , wondering if he was saying too much . " Ah , " Orthallen said after a moment . " That is a comfort . The child seems to have a wisdom out of keeping with her years . However , if she should feel she 's having problems , I would appreciate it if you 'd tell me . After all , as the Queen 's eldest Councillor , I should be aware of possible trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any way I can , but she still seems to be carrying over that grudge from her student days , and I doubt she 'd ever give me the correct time of day , much less confide in me . " Kris had mumbled something noncommittal , and his uncle had gone away outwardly satisfied  --  but the whole encounter had left a very bad taste in Kris ' mouth . He was regretting now the fact that he 'd confided to his uncle in one of those early conversations his belief that Talia and Dirk were lifebonded ; the man had seized on the tidbit as avidly as a hawk on a mouse . But at the same time , he did n't want to have to face Talia herself with these suspicions awakened ; she 'd get it out of him , no doubt of it . And while she would n't say , " I told you so , " she had a particular look of lowered eyelids and a quirk at one corner of her mouth that spoke volumes , and he was n't in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only too possible that she 'd infected with her paranoia . If only he could be sure of that  --  but he could n't . So he avoided her . Dirk straddled an old , worn chair in his room , staring into the darknessbeyond the windowpane . It was nearly dusk  --  and as black as midnight out there . He felt as if he were being torn into little bits . He could n't make up his mind what he wanted to do ; part of him wanted to battle for Talia by all means fair or foul , part of him felt that he should be unselfish and give Kris a clear field with her , part of him was afraid to find out what she thought of all this , and a fourth part of him argued that he really did n't want any commitmentsto females anyway  --  look what the last one had gotten him . The last one . Lady Naril  --  oh , gods . He stared at the sullen flickers of lightning in the heart of the clouds above the trees . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . Gods , I was such a fool . He and Kris had been posted to the Collegium , teaching theirp520specialties  --  Fetching and Farsight . It had been his first experience of Court and Collegium as a full Herald . I was a stupid sheep looking for a wolf . Not that he had n't had his share of dalliances , even if he 'd always had to play second to Kris . He had n't minded , not really . But he 'd been feeling a little lost ; Kris had been born to Court circles , and flowed back into them effortlessly . Dirk had been left on the outskirts . Then Naril had introduced herself to him I thought she was so pure , so innocent . She seemed so alone in the great Court , so eager for a friend . And she was so young  --  so very beautiful . How could he have known that in her sixteen short years she 'd had more men in her thrall than a rosebush had thorns ? And how could he have guessed she intended to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of my mind with love for her . He stared at the reflection in the window , broodingly . I saw only what I wanted to see  --  that 's for certain . Lost most of my few wits . But there had been just enough sense left to him that when she 'd asked him to arrange a private meeting between herself and his friend , he 'd hidden where he could overhear her . The artificial grotto in the garden that she had chosen was secluded  --  but had ample hiding space in the bushes to either side of the entrance . Dirk probed at the aching memory as if it were a sore tooth , taking twisted pleasure from the pain . I could hardly believe my ears when I heard her issuing Kris an ultimatum : come to her bed until she tired of him , or she would make my life a living hell . He had burst in on them , demanding to know what she meant , crazy-wild with anger and pain . Kris had slipped away . And Naril turned to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd finished what she had to say to him , he 'd wanted to kill himself . Again he stared at his reflection . Not everything she said was wrong  --  he told himself sadly . What woman with any sense would want me ? Especially with Kris in reach . . . . It had been a long time before he 'd stopped wanting to die  --  and a longer time before life became something he enjoyed instead of something he endured . Now  --  was it all happening again ? He was doing his level best to come to terms with himself , andp521being stuck at the Collegium with Talia in sight at least once a day was n't helping . The whole situation was comical , but somehow when he tried to laugh it off , his " mirth " had a very hollow sound even to his ears . He had thrown himself into his work , only to find that he was watching for her constantly out of the corner of his eye . He could n't help himself ; it was like scratching a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it anyway , and it gave him a perverse sort of satisfaction . And even though it troubled him to watch her , it troubledhim more not to . Gods , gods  --  what am I going to do ? The reflection gave him no answer . After three weeks of rain , the weather had cleared for a bit . To Talia 's great relief , things were emotionally on a more even keel , at least where the tempers of Court and Collegium were concerned . The evening had been warm enough to leave windows open , and the fresh air had made a gratifying change in the stuffiness of her quarters . Talia was fast asleep when the Death Bell shattered the peace of the night with its brazen tolling . It woke her from a nightmare of flame , fear , and agony . That nightmarehad held her in a grip so tenacious that she expected to open her eyes to find her own room an inferno . She clutched the blankets to her chest , as she slowly became aware that the air she breathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and choking . It took several moments for her to clear her mind of the dream enough to think clearly again , and when at last she did , it was to realize that the dream and the Death Bell 's tolling had related causes . Fire  --  her nails bit into her palms as she clenched her hands . When fire was involved , the Herald most likely to be involved with it was  --  Griffon ! Dear gods  --  let it not be Griffon , not her year-mate , not her friendBut as she stared unseeing into the darkness and forced herself into a calmer frame of mind , she knew without doubt that it was not Griffon , after all . The name and the face that hazed into her nowreceptivemind were those of a student of the year following hers  --  Christa , whom she remembered as one of Dirk 's pupils in the Gift of Fetching . And in many ways , this was an even greater tragedy , for Christa had still been on her internship assignment.  |p522When  the pieces were all assembled from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " when the Death Bell began ringing , the result was almost as confusing as having no information at all . This much alone they knew ; Christa was dead ; the Herald assigned as her counselor , the cheerfully lascivious Destria , was badly hurt , and the cause had something to do both with raiders and a great fire . The information they received from the Heralds stationed with the Healing Temple to which Destria had been carried was nearly as fragmentary . Their Gifts of Mindspeech were n't nearly as strong as Kyril 's or Sherrill 's . But they made it plain that Destria needed more help than they could provide  --  and that there was urgent need of a different kind of aid . They were sending Destria back to Healer 's Collegium and the Palace , and with her would come clarification . Within the week they came ; one uninjured Herald , Destria ( a pitifulthing carried on a litter swung between two Companions , one of them Destria 's Sofi ) , and a battered and bruised farmer whose clothingstill bore the smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them had to have traveled day and night with scarcely a pause to rest to reach the capital so quickly . Selenay called the Council into immediate session , and the petitionercame before them . He sagged wearily into the chair they set for him , his eyes sunken deeply into their sockets , his hair so full of ash it was hard to tell what color it was . It was plain he had wasted not even a single hour , but had gotten on with the journey without taking time for his own comfort . And the tale he told , of well-armed , organized raiders , and the near-massacre of everyone in his town , was enough to chill the blood . They had given him a seat , since he was plainly too weary to stand for very long , and he seemed like an omen of doom , sitting before the Council table , both hands bandaged to the elbow . The taint of smoke had so permeated his clothing that it was carried even to the Councillors , and the smell of it brought his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pure and simple , " he told the Council in a voice roughened by the smoke . " And we walked into it like silly sheep . Up until this spring we 've had so much problem with brigands , little bands of them , pecking away at us , that we 'd come to expect them , like spring floods . Then , when they all vanished this winter  --  gods , you 'd think we 'd have had the sense to realize something wasp523up . But we did n't ; we just thought they 'd gone off to richer pickings . Ah , fools , fools and blind ! " He dropped his face into his hands for a moment , and when he lifted it again , there were tears on his cheeks from eyes already red . " They 'd gotten together , you see ; one of the wolves had finally proved the strongest , and they 'd gotten together . We 'd prided ourselveson having put the village in an unassailable valley ; sheer rock to our back and sides , and only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be starved or forced out from thirst ; we had our own wells , and plenty of food stockpiled . Well , they had an answer to that . A handful of them killed the sentries , and poisoned the dogs that patrolledthe heights , then rained fire arrows down on the village by night . We build with wood and thatch , mostly ; the buildings went up like pitch torches . The rest waited outside the pass , and picked off those of us that got as far as the cleft . Have you ever seen rabbits running before a grass fire ? That was us  --  and they were the hungry wolves waiting for dinner to leap into their jaws . Men I 've known all my life I watched getting their legs shot out from underneath them . Children hardly old enough to be wearing knives , too  --  even graybeards and grannies . Anybody likely to be able to take up a weapon . They shot to cripple , not to kill ; dead mouths ca n't tell where they 've hid their little treasures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may never walk right again . A good quarter bled to death where they lay . And a full quarter of the children hurtled to death in the houses they set fire to . " A muted murmur of horror crept around the table ; Lady Kester hid her own face in her hands . A beam of late afternoon sunlight spotlighted the speaker as it poured in through the high windows . It touched him with a clear gold that made his eyes seem even more like burned-out pits in his face . " Your Heralds were not far ; overnighting in a Waystation , I think . How they knew our plight , I 'll never know  --  must 've been more of your magic , I guess . They came charging up on the backs of the raiders , two of ' em like a blessed army . Those white horses  --  the Companions  --  they were damn near an army by themselves . They broke up the ambush at the head of the pass , got them scattered off into the woods for a bit . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearing the snipers off the heights ; the younger one took off into the burning buildings , hearing cries and looking for somebody to save , I guess . The older one did n't even notice she was gone  --  until  --  "  |p524He  swallowed hard , and his hands were shaking . " I heard screaming , worse than before ; the older Herald , she jerked like she 'd been shot . She shouted at us to take the brigands before they got themselvesover their fright , then she headed into the fires herself ; I followed  --  myhands were too burned to hold a weapon , but I thought I might be able to help with the fires . The younger one had gotten trapped on the second floor of one of the houses ; I was right behind the older one and I could see her against the fire . Calm as you please , she 's tossing younglings out to their parents . At least I think she was tossing ' em  --  she 'd have a little one in her hands one moment , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The older one ran up , started shouting at her to jump . She just shook her head , and turned back one more time  --  the floor collapsed then . That damn horse of hers crashed through the wall and went in after her  --  the other Herald was right on his heels . She 'd no sooner cleared the door when the whole roof caved in . We got her out , but the other  --  " One of Selenay 's pages brought him wine , and he drank it gratefully , his teeth chattering against the rim of the tankard . " That 's what happened . For us , we beat ' em back , but we did n't get more than a handful of them compared to the numbers we know they 've got . They 're comin ' back , we know they are . ' Specially since they must know the Heralds are  --  gone . We lost half the town  --  most of the able-bodied . I was about the only one that could make the ride here . We need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " You 'll have that help , " Selenay pledged , her eyes hard and black with anger as she stood . " This is n't the first incursion of these bastardswe 've heard of , but it 's by far and away the worst . It 's obvious to me that there is no way we can expect you folk to handle brigands as organized as these are . Lord Marshal , and good sir , if you 'll come with me we 'll mobilize a company of the Guard . " She looked inquiringlyat the rest of the Council . Lady Cathan spoke for all of them . " Whatever is needed , Highness . You and the Lord Marshal are the best judge of what that is . We 'll stand surety for it . " Talia nodded , with all the other Councillors . What Selenay had told the man was true ; for the past few months there had been tales of bandits growing organized in Gyrefalcon 's Marches . Sporadic raids had occurred before this  --  but never had the brigands dared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously more than local militia could handle ; the entire Council was agreed on that . Talia slipped away then , knowing with certainty that Selenay didp525not need her at the moment , and that another most definitely did . The tug at her was unmistakable . She opened the door to the Councilchamber just enough to slip through  --  and once she was out into the cool , dark hallway , broke into a run . She ran out through the old Palace and passed the double doors of Herald 's Collegium  --  then down the echoing main hall , heading for the side door and for Healer 's . She felt the pull of a soul in agony as clearly as if she were being called by voice . She all but collided with Devan , who was on his way to look for her . " I might have known you 'd know , " he said gratefully , hitching up his green robes so that he could run with her . " Talia , she 's fighting us , and we ca n't get past her shielding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Christa , and all she wants to do now is die . Rynee ca n't do anything with her . " " That 's what I thought ; Lord and Lady , the guilt is so thick I can almost see it . Well , let 's see if I can get through to her . " They had accomplished a certain amount of Healing at the site of the battle , while Destria was still unconscious ; enough to enable moving her safely . She still was a most unpretty sight , lying on a special pad in one of the rooms reserved for burn patients . The room itself was bare stone ; scrubbed spotless twice a clay when unoccupied , and not so much as a speck of dust was ever allowed to settle there . The one window was sealed tight so that nothing could blow in . Everything that was brought in was removed as soon as it was no longer needed , and scalded . It was a tribute to the onsite Healers that Destria was still among the living . The last person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had taken the full fury of an angry firebird on his fragile flesh . Where her burns had been relatively light  --  though the skin was red , puffed , and blistering  --  she was unbandaged . But her arms and hands were wrapped in special poultices of herbs and the thinnest and most fragile of tanned rabbit and calfskin , and Talia knew that beneath those bandages the skin was gone , and the flesh left raw . They had laid her on a pallet of lambskin , tanned with the wool on ; the fibers would cushion her burned skin and prevent too much pressure from being exerted on it . Talia knelt at the head of the pallet and rested both her hands on Destria 's forehead . Destria 's face and head were the only portions of her that were relatively untouched . As Talia reached into the whirlwind of pain , delirium , and guilt with her Gift , she knew that this was likely to be the hardest such fight she 'd ever faced.  |p526Guilt  , black and full of despair , surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lanced through the guilt like red lightning . Talia knew her first priority was to find out why the guilt existed in the first place , and where it was coming fromThat was easy enough ; she simply lowered her shielding a fractionmore , and let herself be drawn in where the negative emotions were the thickest . The fading core that was Destria spun an ever-tightening cocoon of bleakness around herself . Talia reached for that cocoon with a softly glowing mental " hand " and withered it until that which was Destria stood cringing before her . Talia paid no heed to her attempts at escape , but drew her into a rapport in which nothing was hidden ; not from her  --  and not from Destria . And she let Destria read her as she strove to begin the Healingof the other Herald 's mental hurts . I failed  --  that was the most overwhelming . They counted on me , and I failed . But there was something more , something that kept the guilt feedingon itself until Destria loathed her own being . And Talia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed because I wanted something for me . I failed because I was selfish ; I do n't deserve my Whites  --  I deserve to die . This was something Talia was only too familiar with ; and was something Rynee would n't understand . Healers were firm believers in a little honest selfishness ; it kept a person sane and healthy . Heralds , though  --  well , Heralds were supposed to be completely unselfish , totally devoted to duty . That was nonsense , of course ; Heralds were only people . But sometimes they started to believe in that nonsense , and when something went wrong , because of their natures , the first people they tended to blame were themselves . So now Talia had to prove to Destria that there was nothing wrong with being a Herald and human . No small task , since Destria 's guilt was akin to doubts she shared about herself . How often had she berated herself for wanting a little corner of life to call her own  --  some time when she did n't have to be a Herald  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of others before taking the smallest action ? How many times had she yearned for a little time to be lazy , a chance for a bit of privacy  --  and then felt guilty because she had ?  |p527And  had n't she had been ready to assume that she was guilty of unconsciously using her Empathy to manipulate others ? Had n't she been angry enough to strangle someone more than once , and then been angry at herself for giving in to the weakness of rage ? Oh , she understood Destria 's self-loathing , only too well . Rynee and the rest of the Healers watched soberly , sensing the battle Talia fought , though ( except for the perspiration beading Talia 's brow ) there were no outward signs of a struggle . They all remained in the same positions they had first taken as the shadows cast through the window lengthened almost imperceptibly and the light slowly faded ; and still there was no outward indication of success or failure . Then , after the first half-hour , Rynee whispered to Devan , " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first few minutes and would n't let me in again . " When a full hour had passed , Talia sighed , then carefully broke her physical contact with the other Herald , and slumped with exhaustion , her hands lying limply on her thighs . " Go ahead ; I 've got her convinced for now . She wo n't fight you at the moment . " As she spoke , the waiting Healers converged on l ) estria like worker-bees on an injured queen . Rynee , whose Gift of l lealing was ( like Talia 's ) for minds rather than bodies , helped ' I'alia to her feet . " Why could n't I get through to her ? " she asked plaintively . " Simple ; I 'm a Herald , you 're not , " Talia said , edging past the Healers and out into the hall . " She reacted to you the way you would react to a nonHealer trying to tell you that a gut-stab was nothing to worry about . Gods , I 'm tired ! And I 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight you again . And then , when I finally convince her permanently that it was n't her fault , I 'll have to convince her she is n't going to revolt men with  --  the way she 'll look when you 're done . And that the scarring is n't some punishment set on her for being a bit randy . " " I was afraid of that . " Rynee bit her lip . " And she is going to scar ; I ca n't tell you how badly yet , but there 's no getting around it . Her face was n't touched , but the rest of her  --  some of it is n't going to be at all pretty . The only burn victim I 've ever heard of that was as bad was  --  " Despite her weariness , Talia 's eyes lighted when she saw an ideap528begin to form behind Rynee 's frown . " Out with it , milady  --  you 've the same Gift as I have , and if you 've gotten a notion it 's probably going to work . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall ; Rynee rubbed the bridge of her long nose with her finger . " Vostel  --  what does he do now ? Could he be recalled here for a while ? " she asked finally , hope in her cloud-gray eyes . " Relay at the Fallflower Healing Temple ; and yes , anyone on relay work can be replaced . What are you thinking of ? " " That he 'll be the best medicine ' for her ; he went through it all himself . He knows how it hurts , and when it 'll stop , and how you have to force yourself to work through the pain if you intend to get the full use of your limbs back . And he 's a Herald , so she 'll believe what he says . Besides all that , despite the old scars he 's still a **30;15545;TOOLONG . And he does n't believe in the fates dealingout arbitrary punishments for a little healthy hedonism . " Talia chuckled in spite of herself . " Oh , very good ! If we have him at her side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us ! You 're right about his beliefs , too . All I had to do was keep reassuringhim that the pain would end , and that he was n't being a coward and a whiner for occasionally wanting to give up . I 've no doubt they 'll find each other quite congenial when Destria 's back to something like her old self and her old appetites . I 'll see Kyril and get Vostel sent here as soon as he can be replaced ; he 'll be here by the time she starts to need him . " Talia moved away from the wall and stumbled as her knees wobbleda little . They had only gotten a few feet down the hall , and already her exhaustion was threatening to overwhelm her . Rynee steered her toward a soft and comfortable-looking padded bench , one of many placed at intervals along the walls , for Healers were apt to catch oddments of rest wherever and whenever they could . " And you  --  you get yourself down onto that couch and take a short nap . I 'll wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you wo n't be of any use to any of us . You know the saying  --  never argue with a Healer  --  " " And I never do ! " " See that you keep it that way . " About a week later Talia was on her way from the Audience Chamberto her own room to change for arms practice , and her mood was a somber one . The audiences were no longer dull , and that wasp529unfortunate . More and more often those seeking audience with the Queen were from Gyrefalcon 's Marches reporting the depredations of what was obviously a small army of bandits . It was the wild and rocky character of the countryside that had let them organize withoutanyone realizing it ; that same wild countryside enabled them to vanish before the Guard could pin them down . Orthallen was using the existence of these bandits as a political tool  --  a tactic that disgusted Talia , considering the suffering that they were causing , not to mention that they were preying on some of the lands supposedly in his jurisdiction . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heralds out there now  --  along with the Guard company Selenay had sent . The Heralds were organizing the commonfolk to their own defense , since the Guard could not be everywhereat once . One of those Heralds , Herald Patris , sent a messenger that had only arrived today . " They seem to know exactly where the Guard is at all times , ' Patris had written . They strike , and are away before we can do anything . They know these hills of stone and the caves that honeycombthem better than we guessed ; I suspect them of traveling a great deal underground , which would certainly answer the question of how they move about without being spotted . At this point , we are beyond saving the livestock or the harvest ; Majesty , I must be frank with you . It will be all we can do just to save the lives of these people . And I must tell you worse yet  --  having stripped them of all possessions , the bastards have taken to carrying off the only thing these folk have left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lady Wyrist had exclaimed . " I 'm on it , Majesty , " Lady Cathan had said grimly at almost the same moment . " They wo n't get children out past my Guildsmen  --  not after that slaver scandal  --  with your permission ? " Selenay had nodded distractedly , and Lady Cathan sprinted from the room in a swirl of colorful brocades . " Majesty , " Orthallen said then , " It is as I have been saying . We need a larger standing army  --  and we need more autonomy in local hands . If I had been given two or three companies of the Guard and the power to order them , this emergency would never have become the disaster it is ! " Then the debate had broken out  --  yet again . The Council had split on this issue of granting power at the local level and increasing the size of the Guard ; split about equally . On Orthallen 's side were Lordp530Gartheser , Lady Wyrist , Bard Hyron , Father Aldon and the Seneschal . Selenay  --  who did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so would mean drafted levies and possibly impressment  --  preferred to keep the power where it was , with the Council , and was lobbying for hiring professional mercenaries to augment the existing troops . Backing her were Talia , Kyril , Elcarth , Healer Myrim , and the Lord Marshal . Lady Kester , Lord Gildas , and Lady Cathan remained undecided . They were n't especially pleased with the notion of foreign troops , but they also were n't much in favor of hauling folk away from their lands and trades either . Talia was pondering the state of things when her sharp ears caught the sound of a muffled sob . Without hesitation she unshieldedenough to determine the source , and set out to find out what was wrong . Her sharp ears led her into a seldom-used hallway near the Royal Library , one lined with alcoves which could contain statues or suits of plate-mail or other large works of art , but which were mostly vacant and screened off by velvet curtains . This was a favored place for courting couples during great revels , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted standing . She had a little problem finding the source of the sob , as it was hiding itself behind the curtains in one of those alcoves along this section of hall . Only a tiny sniffle gave her the clue as to which of three it was . She drew the heavy velvet curtain aside quietly ; curled up on a cushion purloined from a chair in the audience chamber was a child . He was a little boy of about seven or eight ; his eyes were puffy from crying , his face was smeared where he 'd scrubbed tears away with dirty fingers , and from the look of him , he had n't a friend in the world . She thought that he must have been adorable when he was n't crying , a dark-haired , dark-eyed cherub ; the uniform Selenay 's pages wore , sky-blue trimmed in dark blue , suited his fair complexion . He looked up when the curtain moved , and his face was full of woe and dismay , his pupils dilated in the half-light of the hall . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring herself down to his level . " You look like you could use a friend . Homesick ? " A fat tear trickled slowly down one cheek as he nodded . He looked very young to have been made one of Selenay 's pages ; she wondered if he were n't a fosterling.  |p531  " I was , too , when I got here . There were n't any girls my age when I first came , just boys . Where are you from ? " " G-g-gyrefalcon 's Marches , " he gulped , looking as if her sympathyhad made him long for a comfortable shoulder to weep on , but not daring to fling himself on a strange adult . " Can I share that pillow ? " she asked , solving the problem for him . When he moved aside , she settled in with one arm comfortingly around his shoulders , projecting a gentle aura of sympathy . That released his inhibitions , and he sobbed into the velveteen of her jerkin while she soothingly stroked his hair . He did n't need her Gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to cry himself out . While she gentled him , she pummeled her memory for who he could be . " Are you Robin ? " she asked finally , when the tears had slowed a bit . At his shaky affirmative she knew she 'd identified him correctly . Robin 's parents , who held their land of Lord Orthallen , had prevailed on Orthallen to take their only child to the safest haven they knew  --  Court . Understandable , even laudable , but poor Robin did n't see their reasoning . He only knew that he was alone for the first time in his young life . " Have n't you found any friends yet ? " Robin shook his head and clutched her sleeve as he looked up to read her expression . When he saw that she was still sympathetic and encouraging he took heart enough to explain . " They  --  they 're all bigger an ' older . They call me tag-along ' an ' they laugh at me . . . an ' I do n't like their games anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with ' em . " " Oh ? " She narrowed her eyes a little in thought , trying to rememberjust what it was she 'd seen the pages playing at . You took them so for granted , they were almost invisible  --  then she had it . " You do n't like playing war and castles ? " That was understandableenough , when fighting threatened his parents . The flicker of the oil-lamp opposite their alcove showed her his sad , lost eyes . " I  --  I do n't know how to fight . Da said I was n't old enough to learn yet . That 's all they want to do  --  an ' anyway , I 'd rather r-r-read  --  but all my books are still at h-h-home . " And if she knew the Seneschal , he 'd strictly forbidden the pages to enter the Palace Library . Not too surprising , seeing as most of them would have played catapults using the furniture , with the books as ammunition . She hugged his slight shoulders , and made a quick decision.  |p532  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons at the Herald 's Collegium instead of with the pages ? " Selenay had all of her pages schooled , but for most of them it was a plague to be endured or a nuisance to be avoided . He nodded , his eyes round with surprise . " Well , my master Alberich is going to have to wait a little ; you and I are going to go see Dean Elcarth . " She rose and offered her hand , he scrambled to his feet and clutched it . Fortunately there were plenty of other youngsters being schooled at the Collegia  --  though few were as young as this one . They were the unaffiliated students  --  the " Blues "  --  who belonged to no Collegium , but were attending classes along with the Bardic , Healer and Heraldic students . They , too , wore uniforms , of a pale blue , and not unlike the page 's uniform . A good many of them were well-born brats , but there were others that were well-intentioned  --  those studying to be builders , architects , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to welcome Robin into their ranks , and they 'd probably adopt him as a kind of mascot . Talia knew she 'd have no trouble in arranging with Selenay for this little one to spend most of his time at the Collegium when he was n't standing his duty  --  and at his age , his " duty " was probably less than an hour or two a day . She was pretty certain she 'd be able to convince Elcarth as well . She was right . When she took the child to Elcarth 's cramped office , piled high with books , the Dean seemed to take to Robin immediately ; Robin certainly did to him . She left him with Elcarth , the gray-haired Herald explaining some of the classes , Robin snuggled trustingly against his chair , both of them oblivious to the dust and clutter about them . It seemed that she 'd unwittingly brought togethera pair of kindred spirits . So it proved ; she met Robin from time to time thereafter  --  once or twice when he 'd unthinkingly sought her out as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time trudging merrily about the Collegium , his arms loaded with a pile of books almost as tall as he  --  and more than once , in the Library , with Elcarth . Once she found both of them bent over an ancient tome of history written in an archaic form of the language that little Robin could n't read himself , but just knew Elcarth could  --  and said so . He was convinced that Elcarth was the original fount of allp533knowledge . He was bringing Elcarth all his questions , as naturally as breathing . Until now Talia frequently found both of them immersed in something so dry that she needed a drink just thinking about it ! Kindred souls , indeed.  |p534DIRK  SPRAWLED IN HIS FAVORITE CHAIR IN HIS QUARTERS , A BATTERED OLD PIECE OFfurniture long ago faded to indeterminate beige , but one that was as comfortable as an old boot . He wished that he could be as comfortableinside as he was outside . He stared at the half-empty glass in his hand morosely . He should n't be drinking on such a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he knew it . But what 's a man to do when he ca n't sleep ? When all he thinks of is a certain pair of soft brown eyes ? When he does n't know whether to betray his own heart or his best friend ? The only cure for his insomnia was to be found at the bottom of a bottle ; so that 's where he usually was at day 's end . Of course the cure had its drawbacks ; wretched hangovers , increasinglyill temper , and the distinct feeling that avoiding problemswas the coward 's way out . He longed for a field assignment  --  oh , gods , to get away from the Collegium and Her ! But nothing of the kind was forthcoming  --  and anyway , they would n't assign anything to Kris or him until their current batch of students was fully trained in the use of their Gifts . Their students  --  gods , there was another reason to drink . He finished the glass without even noticing he 'd done so , eyes burning with unshed tears.  |p535Poor  little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been using her Gift to save the little ones in that fire . Any time I close my eyes , I can almost see herThe self-conjured vision was horrific . He could picture her only too easily ; surrounded by an inferno , steadfastly concentrating with all her soul  --  because moving anything alive by means of the FetchingGift was hard ; hard and dangerous  --  while the building went up in flames around her . And it was all his fault that she 'd sacrificed herself that way . He raised his glass to his lips , only to discover that it was empty already . I 'm drinking this bottle too fastAnd the way she 'd died  --  it was all his fault . Before Christa had finished training with him she 'd asked him if it was possible to move living things by Fetching . Anyone else he 'd have told " no "  --  but she was so good , and he was so infernally proud of her . So he told her the truth , and what was more , done what he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move live creatures without smothering them , without twisting them up inside . And he 'd told her ( gods , how well he remembered telling her ) that when it had to be done , it was far safer to move a living thing from your hands to where you wanted it to go , than from where it was to your hands . I am definitely drinking this too fast  --  the bottle 's half empty already . That was why she 'd gone in to send the babies out , not Fetched them out to her . If only he 'd known when he 'd taught her what he 'd discovered since , researching in the Library  --  that under great stress it was often possible for someone with their Gift to transport themselvesshort distances . He 'd meant to tell her  --  but somehow he never found the time . Now she 's dead , horribly , painfully dead , because I " never found the time . " He shook the bottle , surprised to find it empty already . Oh , well , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even have to get up ; the second bottle was cooling on the windowsill . He reached out an unsteady hand and somehow managed to grab the neck of it . He 'd already taken the cork out when he was sober , then stuck it back in loosely . If he had n't , he 'd never have gotten the bottle open . Gods , I 'm disgusting.  |p536He  knew this was not the way to be handling the problem ; that he should be doing what his heart was telling him to do  --  find Talia , and let her help him work it all out . But he could n't face her . Not like this . I ca n't let her see me like this . I ca n't . She 'll think I 'm  --  I 'm worse than what Naril called me . Besides , if he did go to her , she 'd read the rest of what was on his mind , and then what would he do ? Gods , what a tangle he 'd gotten himself into . I  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need her more than Kris does ? I do n't know . I just do n't know . He could n't ask Kris for help , not when Kris was the other half of the problem . And music was no longer a solace , not when every time he played he could hear her singing , haunting every line . Damn the woman ! She steals my friend , she steals my music , she steals my peace of mindIn the next instant he berated himself for even thinking such things . That was n't fair , it was n't her fault . She had n't the least notion of what she 'd done to him . And so far as he 'd been able to tell , she really had n't been spendingall that much time with Kris since she 'd gotten back . Maybe there was hope for him , after all . She and Kris surely were n't behavinglike lovers . But what would he do if they were in love ? For that matter , what would he do if they were n't ? The level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and failed  --  to cope . Robin trotted happily down the hall to the Herald 's quarters . He adored the Heralds , and was always the first to volunteer when someone had a task that would involve his helping them in any way . In this case it was twice the pleasure , for the Queen 's Own , Herald Talia , had come looking for a page to return some manuscriptsshe 'd borrowed from Herald Dirk for copying . Robin loved Herald Talia better than all the others put together  --  excepting only Elcarth . Heralds were wonderful , and Talia was even more than usuallywonderful ; she always had time to talk , she never told him he was being a baby ( like Lord Orthallen did ) when he was homesick . His Mama had told him how important Lord Orthallen was , but so far as Robin was concerned , Talia was worth any twelve Orthallens . He had often wished he could make her smile the way she couldp537cheer him up . She was n't looking very happy lately and anything he could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gladly . There was a swirl of somber robes ahead of him  --  one of the Great Lords . Maybe even his own Lord . Robin kept his eyes down as he 'd always been told to do . It was n't proper for a little boy to gawk at the Great Lords of State , especially not when that little boy was supposedto be running an errand . If it was Orthallen , it was important for him to see that Robin was properly doing his duty . So it was rather a shock , what with the fact that he was watching where he was going and all , when he tripped and went sprawling face-first , all his scrolls flying about him . If the one ahead of him had been a fellow page , he would immediatelyhave suspected he 'd been tripped a-purpose . But a Great Lord could hardly be suspected of a childish prank like that . The Great Lord paused just a moment , papers fluttering around his feet , then went on . Robin kept his eyes down , blushing scarlet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd . That was very odd . He 'd had fourteen scrolls when he 'd been sent on this errand . He knew , because he 'd counted them in Talia 's presence twice . Now he had fifteen . And the fifteenthone was sealed , not just rolled up like the others . He could have gotten muddled , of course . But he could almost hear Dean Elcarth 's voice in his ear , because he 'd asked Elcarth just this very week what he should do if he was asked to do something that did n't seem quite right , or if something happened in the course of his duties that seemed odd . One of the older boys had been sent on a very dubious errand by one of the ladies of the Court , and there 'd been trouble afterward . The page involved had n't had the nerve to tell anyone until it was too late , and by then his memory was all confused . So Robin had asked the wisest person he knew what he should do if he found himself in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but remember , Robin , " Elcarth had told him , " remember everything ; what happened , who asked you , and when , and why , and who was with them . It may be that what you 're being told to do is perfectly legitimate . You could have no way of knowing . But if it is n't , you could be the only person to know the real truth of something . You pages are in a very special position , you know , people look at you , but they really do n't see you . So keep that in mind , and if anything ever happens around you that seems odd ,  |p538remember  it ; remember the circumstances . You may help someone that way . " " Is n't that being a little like a sneak ? " Robin had asked doubtfully . Elcarth had laughed and ruffled his hair . " If you ask that question , you 're in no danger of becoming one , my little owl . Besides , it 's excellent training for your memory . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no answer when Robin tapped at Herald Dirk 's halfopendoor . When he peeked inside , he could see Herald Dirk slumped in a chair at the farther end of the room by his open window . He seemed to be asleep , so Robin slipped inside , quiet as a cat , and left the scrolls on his desk . Talia did n't need a summons that morning ; anyone with the vaguest hint of her Gift of Empathy would have come running to the Queen 's side . Emotional turmoil  --  anger , fear , worry  --  was so thick in the air Talia could taste it , bitter and metallic . She caught the first notes of it as she was dressing , and ran for the royal chambers as soon as she was decent . The two Guards outside the door looked very uncomfortable , as if they were doing their level best to be deaf to the shouting behind the double doors they guarded . Talia tapped once , and cracked one door open . Selenay was in her outer chamber , dressed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her worktable in her " public " room ; there was a sealed scroll on the table before her . With her were Lord Orthallen ( looking unbearably smug ) , a very embarrassed Kris , an equally embarrassed Guardsman , and an extremely angry Dirk . " I do n't give a fat damn how it got there  --  I did n't take it ! " Dirk was shouting as Talia glanced at the sentry outside and entered . She shut the door behind her quickly . Whatever was going on here , the fewer people there were who knew about it , the better . " Then why were you trying to hide it ? " Orthallen asked smoothly . " I was n't trying to hide it , dammit ! I was looking for my headache-powderswhen this idiot barged in without a by-your-leave ! " Dirk did look slightly ill ; pale , with a pain-crease between his brows , his sapphire-blue eyes thoroughly bloodshot , his strawblondhair more than usually tangled . " We have only your word for that . "  |p539  " Since when  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herald 's word been subject to cross-examination ? Your pardon , Majesty , but what in the Havens ' name is going on here ? " " I discovered this morning that some rather sensitive documents were missing , " Selenay answered , looking outwardly calm , though Talia knew she was anything but untroubled . " Lord Orthallen instigateda search , and he found them in Herald Dirk 's possession . " " I have n't been anywhere near the Palace wings for the past week ! Besides , what use could I possibly make of the damned things ? " Dirk 's mental anguish was so intense that Talia wanted to weep . " Look , Uncle , you know my quarters are just down the hall from his . I can pledge the fact that he did n't leave them all last night . " " Nephew , I know this man is your friend . " " If I have to be brutally frank , then I will be , " Kris said , flushing an angry and embarrassed red . " Dirk could n't have moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was dead drunk last night , just like he 's been every night for the past couple of weeks . " Dirk went almost purple , then deathly white . " So ? Since when has inability to move physically hampered anyonewith his Gift ? " Now it was Kris ' turn to pale . " I have n't heard an answer to a very good question  --  Orthallen , what on earth would Dirk want with those documents ? " Talia asked , trying to buy a little time to think . " They would put someone in this Court in a rather indelicate position , " Orthallen replied . " And let us say that the person is entangledwith a young lady with whom Herald Dirk was at one time very much involved himself . Their parting was somewhat acrimonious . His motivation could be complex  --  revenge , perhaps . Blackmail , perhaps . The Queen and I have been attempting to keep this situation from escalating into scandal , but if anyone excepting us saw the contents of these letters , it could throw the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe I 'm hearing a Councillor accuse a Herald of blackmail ! " Talia cried out indignantly . " You just heard my nephew  --  his best friend  --  say he 's been drinking himself insensible every night for the past few weeks . Does that sound like normal behavior for a Herald ? " Orthallen turned to the Queen . " Majesty , I am not saying that this young man wouldp540have purloined these documents were he in his proper mind , but I think there is more than enough evidence to indicate that  --  " " Orthallen , " the Queen interrupted him , " I  --  " " Wait just a moment  --  do n't anyone say anything . " Talia held one hand to her temple , feeling pain stab through her head . The hot press of the emotions of those around her was so intense she was getting a reaction-headache from trying to shield herself . " Let 's just assume for one moment that Dirk is telling the absolute truth , shall we ? " " But  --  " " No , hear me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than someone deliberately going into his room and planting them there  --  could those documents have gotten where they were found ? Dirk , were they there after dinner ? " " Before I started drinking , you mean ? " Dirk replied bitterly . " No . My desk was perfectly clean , for a change . When I woke up this morning , there were about a dozen scrolls there , and this was one of them . " " Fine . I know if someone had gone into your room that normally did n't belong there , you 'd have woken up , no matter what . I can tell you that I sent Robin to you last night with those poems I borrowed . There were exactly fourteen scrolls , and that was n't one of them . Now unless Lord Orthallen would like to accuse me of purloining those documents  --  " " I still had them after you left , Talia , " the Queen said , a distinct edge to her voice . " I also know that none of the Heralds would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page deliberately woke them . The little devils are too ubiquitous ; practically invisible , and we all know they 're harmless . So , it is possible that some time between when Robin left me and when he got to your room , Dirk , an extra scroll got added to his pile . " " Guard , " Selenay addressed the fourth person in the room , and the Guardsman turned to the Queen with gratitude suffusing his face , " Fetch Robin , please , would you ? He 'll be having breakfast in the page 's room about now . Just ask for him . " The Guard left , plainly happy to be out of the situation . When he returned with Robin , Talia took the child to one side , away from the others , and closer to the Queen than to Orthallen . She spoke quietly and encouragingly , taking the initiative before Orthallen had a chance to try and bully him.  |p541  " Robin , I gave you some papers to take to Herald Dirk last night . How many were there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I thought there were fourteen , but  --  " " But ? " " I fell down , and when I picked them up , there were fifteen . I know , because Dean Elcarth told me to remember things that were funny , and that was funny . " " When did you fall down ? " " Near the staircase , by the lion tapestry . " " Was anyone else nearby ? Did you run into anyone ? " " I was n't running , " he said indignantly . " There was a m'lord , but  --  m'lady , Mama always told me not to stare at m'lords , so  --  I did n't see who it was . " " Bright Stars ! " Orthallen suddenly looked shamefaced  --  almost horror-stricken  --  though somehow Talia had the feeling that he was putting on an act . Certainly there was nothing she could sense empathicallybehind his expression . " That was me  --  and I had the scroll at the time . Stars , I must have dropped it , and the child picked it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creeping over his face , and spread his hands with an apologetic grimace . " Herald Dirk , my most profound apologies . Majesty , I hardly know what to say . " " I think we 've all said quite enough for one morning , " Selenay replied tiredly . " Dirk , Kris , I am terribly sorry . I hope you 'll all put this down to an excess of zeal . Talia  --  " Talia just shook her head a little , and said , " We can all talk about it when we 've cooled down . Right now is not the time . " Selenay gave her a smile of gratitude as Orthallen used this as a cue to excuse himself . Talia was not sorry to see him leave . Selenay detailed the Guard to escort Robin back , and asked Talia , " Have you had anything to eat yet ? I thought not . Then go do so , and I 'll see you in Council . " The three Heralds left together , the Guardsman right behind them , escorting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could feel Dirk seething , and braced herself for the explosion . As soon as they were a sufficient distance from the Queen 's chambersthat they were likely to have no audience , it came . " Thanks a lot , friend ! " Dirk all but hissed . " Thanks ever so much , brother ! How I ever managed without your help , I 'll never know ! " " Look , Dirk  --  I 'm sorry  --  "  |p542  " Sorry ! Dammit , you did n't even believe me ! My best friend , and you did n't believe a single word I said ! " " Dirk ! " " Then telling everyone I 'm some kind of drunken fool  --  " " I did n't say that ! " Kris was beginning to get just as angry as Dirk was . " You did n't have to ! You implied it very nicely ! And gave your precious uncle more ammunition to use on me ! " " Dirk , Kris has every right to worry about you if you 've been acting oddly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you did n't believe him without having to read you . " Talia knew she should have kept her mouth shut , but could n't help herself . " And he 's right about Orthallen . " They both turned on her as one , and spoke in nearly the same breath . " And I do n't need any more help from you , Queen 's Own '  --  " " Talia , I 'm getting very tired of listening to your childish suspicionsabout my uncle  --  " She went white-lipped with anger and hurt . " Fine , then  --  " she snarled , clenching her fists and telling herself that she would not deliver a pair of hearty blows to those stubborn chins . " I wash my hands of both of you ! You can both go to Hell in a gilded carriage for all of me ! With purple cushions ! " Unable to get another coherent word out , she spun on her toe and ran to the closest exit , and did n't stop running until she reached the Field and the sympathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done ! " Dirk sneered in triumph . " What I 've done ? " Kris lost what little remained of his temper and groped visibly for words adequate to express his anger . " Gods , I hope you 're satisfied  --  now that you 've managed to get her mad at both of us ! " In point of fact , a nasty little part of him Dirk had n't dreamed existed was pleased , for now , at least , they were on an equally bad footing with Talia . He could hardly admit it , though . " Me ? All I did was defend myself  --  " " I , " Kris interrupted angrily , " have had just about enough of this . I 'll talk to you about this mess if and when you decide to stop behaving like a damn fool and when you quit drinking yourself into a stupor every night . Until then  --  "  |p543  " This is just a little too public a place for you to start making threats . " Kris bit back the angry words that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach . " Far too public , " he replied stiffly , " and what we have to say to each other is far too private , and can and should wait until then . " Dirk made an ironic little bow . " At your pleasure . " There did n't seem to be any way to respond to that , so Kris just nodded abruptly , and stalked off down the corridor . Dirk found himself standing alone in the deserted corridor , templespounding with a hangover , feeling very much abused . He wanted to feel vindicated , and all he really felt like was a fool . And very much alone . By the time Talia arrived for her weaponry lesson , Alberich had heard the rumors that Kris and Dirk had had a falling-out . He was not too terribly surprised when Talia appeared for her practice sessionwearing an expression so coldly impassive it might have been a mask . Few even at the Collegium would have guessed how well he could read the Queen 's Own , or how well he knew her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very alone , and so determined to do everything perfectly . She seldom tried to make excuses for herself , and never gave up , not even when she knew she had no chance of success . She had reminded him of times long past , and a young and idealistic student-cadet of Karse  --  and his sympathy and soul had gone out to her . Not that he would ever have let her know . He never betrayed his feelings to his students while they were still students . He had a shrewd idea of how matters stood with her in regard to her feelings about Dirk and Kris . So he had a fairly good idea what her reaction to the quarrel might be . This afternoon the lesson called for Talia to work out alone against the Armsmaster . She did not hold back in the least  --  began attacking him , in fact , with blind fury as soon as the lesson began . Alberich let her wear herself out for a bit , scar-seamed face impassive , then caught her with a feint not even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enough  --  quite enough , " he said , as she stood white and drained and panting with exhaustion . " Have I not told you many times , it is with your intellect you fight , not with your anger ? Anger you are to leave at the door . It will kill you . Look how you have let it wear youp544out ! Had this been a real fight , your anger would have done half your enemy 's work for him . " Talia 's shoulders sagged . " Master Alberich  --  " " Enough , I have said it , " he interrupted , picking up her blade from the floor . He took three soundless steps toward her , and placed one callused hand on her shoulder . " Since the anger can not be left at the door , you will confide it ? " Talia capitulated , letting him push her gently toward the seats at the edge of the floor . She slumped dispiritedly down onto a bench pushed up against the wall as he seated himself beside her . After a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the morning'sevents . She kept her eyes for the most part on a beam of the late afternoon sunlight that fell upon the smooth , sanded , graybrownwooden floor . No sound penetrated into the salle from the outside , and the ancient building smelled of dust and sweat . Alberichsat beside her , absolutely motionless , hands clasped around the ankle that rested on his right knee . Talia glanced at him from time to time , but his harsh , hawklike face remained unreadable . Finally when she had finished , he stirred just a little , raising his hand to rub the side of his nose . " I tell you what I have never admitted , " he said after a long pause , tapping his lips with one finger , thoughtfully . " I have never trusted Lord Orthallen . And I have served Valdemar fully as long as he . " Talia was taken aback . " But  --  " " Why ? Any number of small things . He is too perfect the servant of the State , never does he take for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim a reward visibly , I look for a reward hidden . He does not openly oppose the Heraldic Circle , but when others do , he is always just behind them , pushing , gently pushing . He is everyone'sfriend  --  and no one 's intimate companion . Also , my Companiondoes not like him . " " Rolan does n't either . " " A good measure by which to judge the man , I think . I believe that your suspicions are correct ; that he has been striving to undermine your influence with Selenay . I think that since he has failed at that , he turns to eliminating your friends , to weaken your emotional base . I think he well knows how it hurts you to see young Dirk injured . " Talia blushed . " You are the best judge of the truth of what I say . " He shifted on the hard , worn bench and recrossed his legs , ankle over knee . " My guess  --  he knows Kris is your partisan ; he could not get Kris top545repudiate you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odds with each other in hopes you would be caught in the middle . " " Me ? But  --  " " If he is of the mind to undermine your authority , this is one way of it , " Alberich added quietly , hands clasped thoughtfully over one knee . " To chip away at those supporting you until they are so entangledin their own misfortune that they can spare no time for helping you . " " I see what you 're getting at , now . He 's removing my support in such a way that I 'm set off-balance . Then , when I 'm in a particularly delicate position , give me a little shove  --  " Talia flicked out a finger , "  --  and with no one to advise me or give me backing , I vacillate , or start making mistakes . And all the things he 's been whispering about my not being quite up to the job look like something more than an old man 's mistrust of the young . I thought you did n't deal with Court politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I said I do not play the game ; I never said I did not know how the game was played . " His mouth turned up a little at one corner . " Be advised , however , that I have never told anyone of my suspicions because I seemed to be alone in them  --  and I did not intend to give Lord Orthallen a reason to gaze in my direction . It is difficult enough being from Karse  --  without earning high-placed enemies . " Talia nodded with sympathy . It had been hard enough on her during her first years at the Collegium . She could hardly imagine what it had been like for someone hailing from the land that was Valdemar 's traditional enemy . " Now I do think he has miscalculated , perhaps to his eventual grief . It is that he has badly underestimated the unity of the Circle , I think , or it is that he can not understand it . Among the courtiers , such a falling out as is between Kris and Dirk would be permanent  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed . " I know they 'll make up eventually  --  Lord of Lights , though , I 'm not sure I can deal with the emotional lightnings and thunders till they do ! Why could n't Ahrodie and Tantris get their hooves into this and straighten it out ? " " Why do you not ? " Alberich retorted . " They are our Companions and friends , delinda , not our overseers . They leave our personal lives to ourselves , nor would any of us thank them for interfering . Yes , they will most probably be whispering sensible things into their Chosen 's minds , but you know well they will not force either of the two into anything . "  |p546She  sighed wistfully . " If I were a little less ethical , I 'd fix both of them . " If you were a little less ethical , you would not have been Chosen , " Alberich pointed out . " Now , since the anger is gone , shall we return to the exercise of the body in place of the tongue ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she rose from her place on the bench . " No , delinda , you do not  --  so guard yourself ! " Elspeth had encountered Orthallen during one of her rare moments of leisure ; she was dawdling a bit on her way back to her suite in the Palace to dress for dinner with the Court . She took dinner with the Court once a week  --  " to remind everyone " ( in her own wry words ) " that they still have an Heir . " She was standing before an open second-story window ; some of the gardens were directly below her . She was wearing a rather wistfulexpression and had n't realized there was anyone else in the corridorwith her until Orthallen touched her elbow . She jumped and started back ( one hand brushing a hidden dagger ) when she realized who it was and relaxed . " Havens , Lord-Un  --  Lord Orthallen , you startled me out of a year 's life ! " " I most sincerely hope not , " he replied , " But I do wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to . Surely now that you 're nearly through your studies you are n't going to become formalwith me ! " " All right , Lord-Uncle , since you ask it . Just remember to defend me for my impudence when Mother takes me to task for it ! " Elspeth grinned , and leaned back on the window-frame a little . " Now what is it that you were watching with such a long face ? " he asked lightly , coming close enough to look out of the window himself . Below the window were some of the Palace gardens ; in the gardensa half-dozen couples  --  children of courtiers or courtiers themselves  --  rangingfrom Elspeth 's age upward to twenty or so . They were involved in the usual sorts of activities that might be expected from a group of adolescents in a sunny garden in the spring . One couple was engaged in a mock-game of " tag , " one girl was embroideringwhile her gallant read to her , two maids were giggling and gasping at the antics of two lads balancing on the basin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his head inp547the lap of his chosen lady , two couples were simply strolling hand in hand . Elspeth sighed . " And why are n't you down there , my lady ? " Orthallen asked quietly . " Havens , Lord-Uncle , where would I get the time ? " Elspeth 's replywas impatient and a touch self-pitying . " Between my classes and everything else  --  besides , I do n't know any boys , at least not well . Well , there 's Skif , but he 's busy chasing Nerissa . Besides , he 's ' even older than Talia . " " You do n't know any young men  --  when half the swains of the Court are near dying just to speak to you ? " Orthallen 's expression of incredulity held as much of bitter as playful mockery , though Elspethwas so used to his manners that she hardly noted it . " Well if they 're near-dying , nobody told me about it , and nobody'sbothered to introduce us . " " If that 's all that 's lacking , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are spending far too much of your time among the Heralds and Heraldic Students . Heralds make up only a very small part of Valdemar , my dear . You need to get to know your courtiers better , particularly those of your own age . Who knows ? You may one day wish to choose a consort from among them . You can hardly do that if you do n't know any of them . " " You have a point , Lord-Uncle , " Elspeth mused , taking another wistful glance out the window , " But when am I going to find the time ? " " Surely you have an hour or two in the evenings ? " " Well , yes , usually . " " There 's your answer . " Elspeth smiled . " Lord-Uncle , you 're almost as good at solving problems as Talia ! " Her face fell a trifle then , and Orthallen 's right eyebrow rose as he took note of her expression . " Is there some problem with Talia ? " " Only  --  only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her more than I do , I know that  --  but  --  I wish I could talk to her the way I used to when she was still a student . She does n't have the time any-more . " " You could talk to me , " Orthallen pointed out . " Besides , Talia 's first loyalty is to your mother ; she might feel obliged to tell her what you confided in her . "  |p548Els|peth  did not reply to this , but his words made her very thoughtful . " At any rate , we were speaking of those young gentlemen who are perishing to make your acquaintance . Would you care to meet some of them tonight , after dinner ? In the garden by the fountain , for instance ? " Elspeth blushed and her eyes sparkled . " I 'd love to ! " " Then , " Orthallen made her a sweeping bow , " it shall be as my lady commands . " Elspeth thought a great deal about that conversation as she sat through dinner . On the one hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a conflict of loyalties there was no doubt to whom her first allegiance was due . She had n't thought about it before  --  but the idea of her mother knowing everything about her was n't a comfortableone . Especially since Selenay did n't appear to be taking Elspeth 's maturityvery seriously . But Elspeth had gained inches since Talia had gone  --  and with the inches , a woman 's curves . She was taking more care with her appearance ; she 'd seen the glances given some of her older friends by the young males of the Collegium and recently those glances had seemed very desirable things to collect . She found that lately she was looking to the young men of Collegium and Court with an eye less bemused and more calculating . And to the eyes of a strangerShe 'd looked at herself in her mirror before dinner , trying to appraisewhat she saw there . Lithe , taller than Talia by half a head , wavy sable hair and velvety brown eyes  --  the body of a young goddess , if certain people were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to know more of life  --  yes . There was no doubt that to a stranger , she looked more than ready to be thinking about wedding or bedding , certainly old enough by the standards of the Court . Or so Elspeth thought , setting her chin stubbornly . Well , if her mother would n't see on her own that Elspeth was quite fully grown now , perhaps there were ways to bring that knowledge home to her . And , she thought , catching sight of Lord Orthallen among a group of quite fascinating-looking young men , it just might be rather excitingas well . . .  |p549THE  WEATHER , WHICH HAD BRIEFLY TAKEN A TURN FOR THE BETTER , SOURED AGAIN . Talia 's mood was none too sweet either . The rains returned , and with them , spoiled tempers among the Councillors . Again Talia found herself spending as much time interveningin personal quarrels as helping to make decisions . Orthallen , strangely enough , seemed content now to let her alone . He brooded down at his end of the Council table like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pondering mysterious thoughts of his own . This alarmed her more than it reassured her . She took to examining every word she intended to say , and weighing it against all the possibleways Orthallen might be able to use what she said against her at some later date . Dirk split his free time either lurking in her vicinity or hiding out in the wet . The one was as frustrating as the other . Either she did n't see him at all , or she saw him but could n't get near him . For whenever she tried to approach him , he turned pale , looked around  --  wearing a frantic expression  --  for the nearest exit , and escaped with whatever haste was seemly . He seemed to have a sixth sense for when she was trying to catch him ; she could n't even trap him in his rooms . Either that , or he somehow knew when she was at the door , and pretended he was n't there . Kris all but hibernated in his room . And Talia was determined not to see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While theirp550quarrel of itself was of no great moment , she was tired to death of having to justify her feelings about his uncle . After her little talk with Alberich , she was certain  --  with a surety that came all too seldom  --  thatin the case of Orthallen she was entirely in the right , and he was entirely in the wrong . And this time she was going to hold out until he acknowledged the fact ! Meanwhile she made up for the absence of both of them by trying to be everywhere at once . She was shorting herself of sleep to do so , and still felt there was much she was n't doing . But there was just so much work ; Selenay had asked her to take on the interviews of petitioners from the flooded areas , Devan needed her with three profoundly depressed patients , and there were all those quarrels among the Councillors . It was with heartfelt gratitude that she found the sessions with Destria going well ; Vostel 's arrival put the cap on their success . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortedher immensely . It helped that he regarded her scars as badges of honor and told her so in as many words . And as Rynee had thought , he was of tremendous aid when they began Destria 's rehabilitativetherapy  --  for he had gone through all this himself . He coaxed her when she faltered , bolstered her courage when it ran out , goaded her when she turned sulky , and held her when she wept with pain . He was doing so much for her that she needed Talia 's Gift less with every day . Which was just as well , for Selenay needed it the more . As soon as one crisis was solved , another sprang up like a noxious weed , and Selenay 's resources were wearing thin . And when some of the choices she made turned out to be the wrong ones  --  as , soon or late , happened  --  Talia found herself exercising her good sense and Gift to the utmost . A drenched and mud-splattered messenger from Herald Patris stood before the Council ; when the door-Guard had learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him there himself . " Majesty , " the man said , with a blank expression that Talia found very disconcerting , and which made her very uneasy , " Herald Patris sends this to tell you that the outlaws are no more . " He held out a sealed message pouch as those at the Council board erupted in cheers and congratulations . Only the Queen , Kyril , and Talia did not join in the rejoicing . There was something about thep551messenger 's expression that told them there was much he had not said . Selenay opened the message and scanned it , the blood draining from her face as she did so . " Goddess  --  " the parchment sheet fell from her nerveless fingers , and Talia caught it . The Queen covered her face with trembling hands , as the tumult around the Council table died into absolute silence . Her Councillors stared at their monarch , and at an equally pale Queen 's Own , as Talia read Patris ' grim words in a voice that shook . " ' We ran the brigands to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bay , the temper of the Guard was fully aroused . We cornered them at their own camp , a valley overlooked by Darkfell Peak . It was then that they made the mistake of killing the envoy sent to parley . At that point the Guard declared " no quarter . " They went mad  --  that is the only way I can describe it . They were no longer rational men ; they were blood-mad berserkers . Perhaps it was being out here too long , chasing phantoms  --  perhaps the foul weather  --  I do not know . It was hideous . Nothing I or anyone else could say or do was able to curb them . They fell on the encampment  --  and the outlaws were slaughtered to the last man . ' " Talia took a deep breath , and continued . " ' It was not just the outlaws themselves ; the Guard slew every living thing in their bolthole , be it man , woman , or beast . But that was not the worst of the horrors , though that was horror enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed , then , and Kyril took the message from her , and continued in a hoarse half-whisper . " ' Among the dead were the very children we had hoped to save . All  --  all of them , dead . Slain by their captors when it became obviousthat they would get no mercy from the Guard . ' " The Councillors stared in dumb shock , as Selenay wept without shame . Selenay blamed herself for not replacing the Guard companies with fresher troops or for not sending someone who could have controlledthe weary Guardsmen no matter what strain the troops were under . Nor was the murder of the children the only tragedy , although it was the greatest . Vital intelligence had been lost in that slaughter  --  who their leader had been , and whether or not he had been acting under orders from outside the Kingdom.  |p552It  took days before Selenay was anything like her normal self . The one blessing , so far as Talia was concerned , was that Orthallenexercised a little good sense and chose to back down on his militant stance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Kester 's people began having the expected troubles with pirates and coastal raiders , and the promised troops had to be shifted to the West . But before they could reach their deployments , Herald Nathen was seriously hurt leading the fisherfolk in beating off a slaving raid . And that opened up another wonder-chest of troubles . Nathen himself came before them , although the Healers protested that he was not yet well enough to do so . He was a sharp-featured man , not old , but no longer young ; brown-haired , **27;15577;TOOLONG except for the intensity in those eyes , and an anger that kept him going when nothing else was left to him . He sat , rather than stood , facing the entire Council . He was heavily bandaged , with his arm bound against his side , and still physically so weak he could scarcely speak above a whisper . " My ladies , my lords  --  " he coughed , "  --  I did not dare trust this to anyone but myself . Messengers can be waylaid , documents pur-loined  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think you may be overreacting . Your injuries . . . " Did not cause me to hallucinate what I heard , " Nathen snapped , his anger giving him a burst of strength . " We captured a prisoner , Councillors ; I interrogated him myself under Truth Spell before I was hurt . The brigands are serving those slavers we thought ban-ished ! " " What ? " Lady Cathan choked out , as she half-stood , then collapsedback into her seat . " There is worse . The slave-traders are not working unaided . I have it by my prisoner 's confession and by written proofs that they have been aided and abetted by Lord Geoffery of Helmscarp , Lord Nestor of Laverin , Lord Tavis of Brengard , and TradeGuildsmen OstenDeveral , Jerard Stonesmith , Petar Ringwright , and Igan Horstfel . " He sank back into his own chair , eyes still burning with controlledrage , as the Council erupted into accusation and counteraccusation . " How could this have occurred without your knowledge ,  |p553Cathan  ? " Gartheser demanded . " By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in rooting out the last lot  --  " " You were right up there in the front ranks to accuse me the last time , Gartheser , " Cathan sneered " but I seem to remember you were also the one who insisted I do all the dirty work . I am only one woman ; I ca n't be everywhere at once . " " But Cathan , I can not see how this could have escaped your knowledge , " Hyron protested . " Those four named are of first-rank . " " And the other three are Kester 's liegemen , " added Wyrist , suspiciously . " I 'd like to know how they managed to operate a slaving ring under Kester 's nose . " " And so would I , " Lady Kester snapped . " More than you , I reckon . " And so it went , as Selenay mediated the strife among her Councillors . Talia had her hands full seeing that she remained sane during all of it . All this , of course , meant that she had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly that of the rift between Dirk and Kris , Kris and herself , and Dirk and herself . It was bad enough that the quarrel existed  --  but to add yet another pine-bough to the conflagrations , Rolan was causing her considerablediscomfort . He was the premier stallion of the Companion herd and while Talia had been on internship , had only had another stallion  --  Kris ' Tantris  --  for company . Now he was making up for his enforced celibacywith a vengeance  --  and the partner he dallied with most often was Dirk 's Ahrodie . And Talia shared it  --  could n't block it if she tried . Not that she blamed Rolan ; Ahrodie was sweet , attractive , and a most cooperativepartner . She ought to know ; she was on the empathic receiving end of all of it . But to have this going on , two and three times a week , while she positively ached for Ahrodie 's Chosen  --  well , it was unpleasantly like torture . Rolan evidently had no notion of what he was doing to his Chosen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . So she lost further sleep at night ; either in suffering through what Rolan was unknowingly inflicting on her or in dreams in which she worked desperately to knit up some undefined but important object that kept unraveling.  |p554She  did n't see Elspeth except at training sessions with Alberich , occasional meals , or now and again with Gwena out in the Field . She seemed a little distracted , and maybe a touch shy , but that was normal for a girl just into puberty , and besides , Talia had her hands full to overflowing . So Talia never once worried about her  --  until one day she realized with a chill of foreboding that she had n't seen the girl in several days , not even at arms practice . Well , that could have been simple circumstance , but it was a situationthat needed rectifying . So Talia went looking for her . She found the Heir in the garden , which was not a place where Elspeth usually spent any time . But she was reading , so she could have decided simply that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Talia called cheerfully , seeing Elspeth 's head snap up at the sound of her voice . " Are you waiting for someone ? " " No  --  no , just got tired of the Library  --  " Had she hesitated a fraction of a second before denying that ? " Say , you 've been so busy , I 'll bet you have n't heard the latest scrape Tuli 's gotten himself into , and I 'll bet you could use a good laugh  --  " With that , Elspeth kept the conversation on Collegium gossip , and then pled tasks elsewhere before Talia could gain control of the situation . The incident left Talia very disconcerted , and when she began seeking the girl out on a regular basis , she only got repetitions of the same . Then Talia began to take note of the specific changes in the girl 's behavior . She was secretive  --  which was unlike her . There was just the vaguest hint of guilt in the way she evaded Talia 's questions . Talia took an indirect approach then , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What she found made her truly alarmed . " Havens , " Tull said , scratching his curly head in puzzlement . " I do n't know where she is . She just sort of vanishes about this time of day . " Uh-huh , " Gerond agreed , nodding so hard Talia thought his head was going to come off . " Just lately . She 's swapped me chores a couple times so she had the hour free  --  an ' she hates floorwashing ! Somethin ' wrong ? " " No , I 've just been having trouble finding her today , " Talia replied , taking care to seem nonchalant . But she was unnerved . These two were Elspeth 's closest friends among her year-mates , and they only confirmed what Talia had be/gun to fear . There were gaps of an hour or so in Elspeth 's day during which she was vanishing , and no one seemed to have any idea of where she was . It was time she checked her other sources  --  the Palace servants . Talia perched herself on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Hall . She had come to her friends  --  for many of the servantswere her friends , and had been since she was a student  --  rather than raise anyone 's attention by having them come to her . Seated about her were a half-dozen servitors she had found to be the most observant and most trustworthy . Two of them , a chambermaid called Elise and a groom named Ralf , had pinpointed the guilty parties when a group of the " Blues " ( or unaffiliated students ) had tried to murder her as a student by attacking her and throwing her into the ice-covered river . Elise had seen several of Talia 's attackers coming in mucky , and thought it more than odd ; Ralf had spotted the entire group hanging about the stable earlier . Both had reported their observations to Elcarth when word spread of the attempt on Talia 's life . " All right , " Talia began , " I have a problem . Elspeth is going off somewhere about midafternoon every day , and I ca n't find out where or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " From the looks exchanged within the group , she knew she 'd found her answer . " She 's  --  this goes no farther , young Talia  --  " this from Jan , one of the oldest there . He was a gardener , and to him , she would always be " young " Talia . Talia nodded and he continued . " She 's hangin ' about with young m'lord Joserlin Corby 's crew . Them as is no better'nrowdies . " " Rowdies ! " Elise snorted . " If ' twere n't for their highborn da 's , they 'd been sent home long ago for the way they paw over every girl they can catch unawares . " " Girl " here meant " female servant " ; if Elise had intended to say that the young men had been mishandling other females , she 'd have said " m'ladies . " Not that this difference was very comforting ; it meant that they were only confining unwantedattentions to the women who dared not protest overmuch . " It 's said , " added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' more'n pawings . " " Such as ? " Talia replied . " You know I wo n't take it elsewhere . " " Well  --  mind , m'lady , this is just tales , but it 's tales I hear from their people  --  this lot is plain vicious . "  |p556Besides  forcing their attentions on the servants of their estates , it seemed that " Corby 's Crew " was given to so-called pranks that were very unfunny . A cut saddle-girth before a rough hunt was no joking matter , not when it nearly caused a death . And some of these same adolescents were the younger brothers and sisters of those who had tried to murder Talia . But thus far  --  that anyone knew  --  Elspeth had not been a participantin any of their activities . It seemed that at the moment she was simply being paid elaborate court to  --  something new to her that she evidently found very enjoyable . But it could well be only a matter of time before they lured her into some indiscretion  --  then used that indiscretion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had probably protected her so far , but Talia was worried that it might not be enough protection for very much longer . This required active measures . She tried to set a watch on the girl , but Elspeth was very clever and kept eluding her . She tried once or twice to read her with a surface probe , but Elspeth 's shields were better than Talia 's ability to penetrate without forcing her . Something was going to have to be done , or among the three of them , Elspeth , Dirk , and Kris were going to drive her mad in white linen . So she decided to try to do something about Dirk first , as being the easiest to get at  --  and since he was n't talking to Kris , the way to him was through her blood-brother Skif . " I 'm as baffled as you are , little sister , " Skif confessed , running a nervous hand through his dark curls , " I have n't got the vaguest notionwhy Dirk 's making such an ass of himself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her temple and collapsingonto an old chair in Skif 's room , " I 'd hoped he 'd have said something to you  --  you were my last hope ! If this does n't clear up soon , I think I 'm going to go rather noisily mad ! " When she had finally given up on trying to manage the problem of Dirk by herself , and had sought out Skif 's aid , he 'd invited her up to his quarters . He 'd been to hers a time or two , but this was the first time she 'd seen his . Skif 's room was much like Skif himself ; neat , decked with odd weapons and thick with books . Lately Talia had n't had much time to devote to picking her own rooms up , and she found his quarters a haven from chaos . He had only one window ,  |p557but  it looked out over Companion 's Field  --  always a tranquilizing view . " First things first  --  this bond you 've got . Kris was right . It 's a lifebond  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt whatsoever of that . I can tell by the way he looks at you . " " He looks at me ? When ? I never see him anymore ! Since the fight he spends all of his time out in the mud . " " Except at meals  --  any meal you take at the Collegium  --  he spends so much time watching you that he hardly eats . And I think he knows your schedule by heart . Any time you might be passing under a window , he 's got an excuse to be near that window . " Skif paced the length of the room restlessly as he spoke , his arms folded . " He 's wearing himself to a thread . That 's why I wanted to talk to you alone here . " " I do n't know how I 'm supposed to be able to help when the man wo n't let me near him . " " Oh , great ! " " He acts like I was a plague-carrier . I 've tried to get him alone ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this mess with the argument with Kris . Now it 's twice as bad . " " Havens , what a mess . " Skif shook his head ruefully . " Ile has n't said anything to me . I ca n't imagine why he 's acting this way . I 've had it though , and I know you 're at your wits ' end . It 's about time we brought this out into the sunlight . Since he wo n't talk to you , I 'm going to make damned sure he talks to me . I 'm going to have it out with him as soon as I can corner him , and I 'll do it if I have to trap him in the bathing-room and steal his clothes ! I 'm going to get things settled between him and Kris and him and you if I have to tie you all together in a bundle to do it ! " Neither of them had reckoned on the whims of Fate . Dirk had been fighting what he thought was a slight cold  --  one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alike  --  for about a week . Perversely he refused to care for it ; continuing to escape Talia and Kris by retreating into the dismal weather out-of-doors . In a bizarre way , he did n't really mind feeling miserable ; concentrating on his symptoms kept him from thinking about Her and Him . Physical misery provided a relief from emotional misery . So he ducked in and out of the cold and rain , day after day , gettingsoaked to the skin more often than not , but not doing muchp558about it except to change his clothing . Added to that , the emotional strain was taking a greater toll on him than anyone  --  including him-self  --  realized . It was midweek , and Talia was taking dinner with the Collegium instead of the Court . She was watching Dirk out of the corner of her eye the entire time , and hoping that Skif was going to be able to fulfill his promise . She was worried  --  very worried . Dirk was white to the ears ; he kept rubbing his head as if it ached . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm . He seemed to be unable to keep his mind on what anyone was saying , and he could n't speak more than two words in a row without going into a fit of coughing . She could also see that Kris was watching him , and looking just as concerned . He pushed his food around without eating much . Kris finally seemed to come to some conclusion , visibly steeled himself , and walked over to sit down next to him . Kris said something to him , which he answered with a shake of his head . Then he stood up  --  and Kris had to catch him as he started to crumple . Kris had decided he 'd had enough . He could n't stand watching his dearest friend fret himself to pieces  --  and he 'd come to some unhappyconclusions over the past couple of weeks . He 'd gone over to sit next to Dirk before the Herald was aware that he was even in the common-room , and spoke his piece before Dirk had a chance to escape . " I was wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my uncle , wrong to have doubted you , and wrong to have said anything about your private life . I apologize . Are you going to forgive me , or will I have to throw myself from the battlements in despair ? " Dirk had started a little when Kris first began speaking in his ear , but had n't moved away . He 'd listened with a mixture of relief and bemusement , then shook his head with a weak smile at Kris ' last sally . Then he stood upAnd the room faded from before his eyes , as he felt his legs give under him . Half a dozen instructors and field Heralds made a rush for him asp559Kris caught him . They lowered him back down into his seat , as he protested weakly that he was all right . " I  --  " he coughed , rackingly . " I just was dizzy a minute  --  " he bent over in a fit of coughs , unable to continue , hardly able to catch his breath . " Like Hell ! " replied Teren , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire , man . You 're for the Healers , and I do n't want to hear any nonsenseout of you about it . " Before he could regain enough breath to object , Teren draped one of his arms over his own shoulders , while a very worried Kris did the same on Dirk 's other side . The rest surrounded the three of them , allowing no opportunity to escape , and escorted them out the door . By the time they 'd reached their goal , his breath was rattling in his chest and there was little doubt of what ailed him . The Healers isolated him and ran everyone else off , and there was very little that anyone could do about it . Talia had turned ashen when he 'd collapsed , and had left her dinner uneaten , waiting for Kris ' return . Kris finally reappeared , to be engulfed by everyone who 'd been present , demanding to know what the Healers had said . " They tell me he has pneumonia , and it 's going to get a lot worse before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying easily across from the doorway to the bench where Talia sat . " And they wo n't let anyone see him for at least a day or two . " Talia made a little noise like a strangled sob , stood quickly , and pushed blindly away from the table . The knot of people surroundingKris had blocked the door nearest her ; she stumbled against benches twice as she fled to the door opposite and to her room . She ran all the way down the corridors of the Collegium and through the double doors leading to the Herald 's Wing . She hurled herself up the darkened spiral staircase of the tower that held her room , pushed the door open and flung herself down on the couch in the outer room of her suite , sobbing with a lost despair she had n't felt since that awful moment in the Waystation . . . . She had n't closed the door behind her in her flight , and was n't in much shape to pay attention to sounds around her . She only realized that she was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow knew it was Keren and Sherrill . She tried to get herself back under control , but Keren 's first words ,  |p560s|poken  in a tone of such deep and unmistakable love that Talia hardly believed her ears , completely undid her . " Little centaur , dearheart , what cause tha ' greeting ? " Keren had slipped into the dialect of her home , something she only did on the rarest of occasions , and then mostly with her twin or her lifemate  --  moments of profound intimacy . That broke down the last of her reserve , and she turned with gratitude into Keren 's arms and wept bitterly on her ready shoulder . " Everything 's gone wrong ! " she sobbed , " Elspeth is n't talking to me anymore , and I know there 's something going on  --  something she does n't want either Selenay or me to know about  --  but I ca n't find out what ! And Dirk  --  and Kris  --  we fought , and now they wo n't talk to me either and  --  and  --  now Dirk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , gods , I 'm a total failure ! " Keren , wisely , said nothing , and let the hysterical words and tears wear themselves out . Sherrill meanwhile went quietly about the room , closing the door and lighting candles against the growing darkness . That done , she seated herself at Keren 's feet to wait . " For tha ' problem of Elspeth I can think of no solution , " Keren said thoughtfully when Talia was in a better state to listen . " But if there was anything truly wrong , her Gwena would surely seek out Rolan  --  and thee would know . " " I had n't even thought of that . " Talia looked up into Keren 's eyes from where she rested on her shoulder , crestfallen at her own stupidity . " Why should thee ? She 's never given thee anxiety before . " Keren almost smiled . " I 'm not thinking very clearly . No , that 's not true . I 'm not thinking at all . It 's wrong of me , but  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can bear this trouble with Dirk without flying to pieces . Keren , I want to be with him so much sometimes I think it would be easier to die ! " Keren sighed . " Lifebond , then , is it ? And with Dirk  --  gods , what a tangle ! Well , that explains his madness , for certain . Lady only knows what cracked notion the lad has in his head , and ' t is sure the thing 's got him all turned round about . " " We know how it can be  --  an agony . " Sherrill rose from her place , sat next to Talia , and slipped her arm around Talia 's waist , joining Keren in supporting her . " It 's hellish , being pulled inside out by something that ca n't be denied and wo n't be turned to anything else . Is anyone trying to help you get this straightened out ? "  |p561At  Talia 's nod , Keren pursed her lips thoughtfully . " I ca n't think of anything at all to help thee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dirk and Kris speaking , then getting Dirk 's mind made up about thee . Hopefully the first is done already . But the second  --  my best guess is that he 's gotten confused somewhere , and has been chasing his own tail . Time , dearling . That 's all it will take . Time . " " If I can just hold out a little longer  --  " Talia relaxed herself with an effort while Keren and Sherrill held her in a circle of love and comfort for long moments . " You know we understand , dearling , " Sherrill said at last for both of them . " Who better ? Now , let 's change the subject . We 're determined to make you smile again . " With that she and Keren took turns telling her the most hilarious stories that they could think of  --  mostly of some of the goings-on at the Collegium during her absence . No few of them were libelous ; all of them were at least undignified . Talia wished profoundly that she had been present to witness the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a strand of waterweed behind his ear . Between the two of them , they soon had her laughing again , and had drained at least some of the tension from her . Finally , Keren nodded to her lifemate and gave Talia a comforting hug . " I think you 're cheered enough to survive the night , clear one , " the older woman said . " Yes ? " " I think so , " Talia replied . " Then let tomorrow take care of tomorrow , and have a good long sleep , " Keren advised , and she and Sherrill departed as quietly as they had come . Talia wandered back into her bedroom to shed her uniform . She dressed for bed , then changed her mind and wrapped a robe about herself and settled down on her couch with a book . She must have dozed off without meaning to , because the next thing she knew , Kris was standing beside her and touching her arm lightly to wake her , and the candles were burned down to stubs in their holders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kris ! " she exclaimed joyfully , then fear took the place of joy . " Is Dirk  --  worse ? " she asked , feeling the color drain from her face . " No , little bird , he 's no worse . I 've just come from there . He 's asleep , and the Healers say he 'll be all right in a week or two . And we 're friends again . I thought you 'd want to know  --  and I wanted to make up with you , too . " " Oh , Kris  --  I  --  I 've never been so miserable in my life , " she con/fessed . " I was so angry with you , that I swore I was n't going to speak to you until you came to me and apologized , but my pride is n't worth wrecking our friendship over . " His expression softened a little , and she realized he 'd been tensed against her answer . " I 've never been so miserable either , little bird . And I 've never felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are n't an idiot . Your uncle is  --  " " My uncle is  --  not what I thought , " he interrupted . " I have to apologize to you , like I apologized to Dirk . I was wrong about my uncle . I 'm not certain what his problem is , but he is trying to undermineyou . And he 's trying to wean me away from you . I 've extracted information from the unwary often enough that I ought to have recognizedit when he was doing it to me  --  but I did n't until just recently . He became a little too eager , and failed to cover his trail . " Kris ' expression was troubled . " I hope that what he did to Dirk was unintentional , but I 'm afraid I ca n't be certain anymore . I wish I knew what his game is . At the moment if I were to hazard a guess , it would be this : he wants the position he had as Selenay 's closest advisor , and he wants me slightly disaffected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trifle stronger than my loyalty to the Circle . You were right ; I was wrong . " " I  --  I 'm almost sorry to hear you say that . " A little breeze from the open window behind her made the candles flicker and stirred locks of his hair as she assessed his rueful expression . " What happened to change your mind ? " " Mostly that he tried too hard after the squabble ; as I said , he tried to pump me for information about you , and made one too many slighting remarks about Dirk . You were right , that he has a grudge against you , though why , I have no idea . And I think he used that incident with the scrolls as a chance to get at you through Dirk . . and as a chance to come between me and Dirk . I can only hope he did n't manufacture it , too . " She almost said angrily that the dropped scroll was no accident , that Orthallen had manufactured the incident , but decided to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the quickest way to close his mind would be to make further accusations . " I have to admit I 'm of two minds about this . I 'm glad you 're coming around to my way of thinking , but I 'm sorry to have changed your faith in your uncle . " " Do n't be , it is n't you that has problems , it 's him . "  |p563  " Well , this is the first time anything has gone right in weeks . Kris , I 'm glad we 're friends again . " He dropped easily to the floor beside her couch . " So am I. I 've missed talking to you . But as for things not going right . . . I do n't know about that . " He grinned ironically . " That advice you gave me on how to deal with Nessa certainly worked . " " I meant to ask you about that , " she said , grateful for the way they dropped back into easy conversation , and glad of his company . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He sighed , and drooped like a mime displaying dejection . " Once she had her way with me , she was off to other conquests . Oh , the perfidy of women ! When will I ever learn ? My heart is forever bro-ken ! " " That 's the first time I ever heard that forever ' equaled the time it takes to boil an egg , " she replied wryly . " Oh , less , I assure you . I had a chance to drop Skif a word on the subject of the fair Nessa . Now he happens to be very appreciative of Nerissa 's quite real charms . So now that he knows the means of keeping her attention  --  which is to play hard-to-get  --  she may very well find herself in the position of hunter-turned-hunted . " " Like the old man said about that handfasted couple in Ia'ivetree . . . do you remember ? " Kris screwed his face up into a fair imitation of the old man 's agetwistedcountenance . " Lor ' help you , Herald ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did , in very deed . Chased ' er till she caught him ! " Talia smiled wistfully . " We had some good times out there , did n't we ? " " There 'll be more . Do n't worry , little bird . I 'll get this tangle straightened as soon as the Healers will let me near to talk to Dirk . You know , this illness may be a blessing in disguise ; he wo n't be able to avoid me or find something that urgently needs his attention , and hopefully he 'll believe the things I tell him . " He stood to leave , and Talia gently touched his hand in thanks . " Take heart , little bird . Things will get better . I can always slip Dirk love-potions with his medicines ! " He winked , and ran lightly down the staircase . She laughed , feeling much eased , and rose ; laying her book down on the table beside the couch . She went slowly about the room and extinguished her lights , and then went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning Talia felt far more optimistic  --  and far readier to tackle her problems face on . And since Dirk was out of reach , the logical problem to tackle was Elspeth . Now she was determined to corner Elspeth and confront her about her behavior . Council and Court kept her occupied most of the day , she missed the girl at arms practice by scant moments . Finally she tried tracking her down after dinner  --  but Elspeth managed to elude Talia again . She had no doubt this time that it was no accident , but a purposeful avoidance . Talia was badly worried . All her instincts told her that things were about to come to a head . She opened her shields and was unsuccessfully trying to locate the girl when she felt an urgent and unmistakable summons from Rolan . With a sinking heart she left the Collegium and ran for the Field . When she reached the fence that surrounded it she saw her worst fears realized . Waiting with Rolan was Elspeth 's Gwena , both of them like marble statues in the moonlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially Gwenawereblurred and chaotic , though there was no mistaking Gwena 's anxiety . Talia touched both their necks and concentrated in an effort to make some sense of the images . Finally she got a series that came clear . . . and Orthallen was at the center of them . Orthallen , and a young courtier who was his creature , one of " Corby 's Crew "  --  and they were planning Elspeth 's disgrace ! She threw herself onto Rolan 's back without a moment 's hesitation . He galloped at full speed to the fence that separated the Field from the barn and stables of the ordinary horses , with Gwena barely keeping up beside him . They vaulted the fence like a pair of great white birds , and headed straight for the haybarn . Talia flung herself off Rolan 's back before they had fully stopped . As she sprinted for the barn , she heard a young male voice murmuringsomething in the darkness , and she flung open the great door with a strength she never even knew she had . Moonlight poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief that matters had not yet had a chance to proceed very far between Elspeth and her would-be lover . He was rattled considerablyby Talia 's sudden appearance . If Elspeth was , she was n't showingit . " What do you want ? " Elspeth asked flatly , refusing pridefully to snatch her jerkin closed where it was unlaced . " To prevent you from making the same mistake your mother did , "  |p565Talia  replied just as coldly . " The mistake of thinking that fine words mean a lofty mind , and a pretty face goes with a noble heart . This young peacock has little more in his mind except to put you in a position where you have no choice but to take him as your consort or disgrace yourself , your mother , and your Kingdom . " " You 're wrong ! " Elspeth defended him passionately . " He loves me ! He told me so ! " " And you believed him , even when your own Companion would have nothing to do with him ? " Talia was white-hot with anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Very well then , she should have evidence that she would accept  --  in plenty . Talia ruthlessly forced rapport on the young courtier . His pettyevil was no match for some of the minds Talia had been forced totouch , though his slimy slyness made her skin crawl . Before Elspeth had a chance to shield herself , Talia pulled her in as well  --  and forced her to see for herself the true thoughts of one who had claimed that he cared for her . With a cry of revulsion , Elspeth tore herself away from him and fled to the opposite side of the barn , while Talia released her mind from the enforced union . She was less gentle with the young popinjay . She had him in a crushing mental grip , and fed his fear without compunction as he gazed at her in dumb terror . " You will say nothing of this to anyone , " she told him , burning each word into his mind . " Because if you dare , you 'll never sleep again  --  for every time you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see  --  " She tore the memory of his worst nightmare out of the bowels of recollection and flung it in his face , brutally invoking terror and forcing that on him as well . He whimpered and groveled at her feet until she threw him violently out of rapport . " Get out of here , " she growled . " Get out , go back to your father 's holding , and do n't come back . " He fled without a single backward glance . She turned to face Elspeth , trying to control her anger by slowing her breathing . " I thought better of you than that , " she said , each word built of ice . " I thought you would have had better taste than to let a creature like that touch you . " Elspeth was crying , but as much out of anger as unhappiness . " Fine words from the Herald Vestal , " she spat . " First Skif , then Kris  --  and now who ? Why should n't I have my lovers as well as you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her nails cut herp566palms . " I think I hear the Brat speaking , " she replied . " The little bitch who wants all the glory of being the Heir , but none of the responsibilities . Oh , Hulda taught you very well , did n't she ? Grab and take  --  snatch all you can , think only of yourself , and never mind what repercussions your actions may have on others . Others do n't matter . Oh , no , not now that you 're Heir . After all , your word is law , right ? Or it should be . And if somebody tries to make you see reason , well , dredge up the worst you can about them and throw it in their faces  --  then they 'll be afraid to try and stop you from doing what you want . Well , that does n't work with me , young woman . For all the importance it has , I could be sleeping with men , women , or chirras , because I 'm not the Heir . You seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when your mother dies . You may have to make a marriage of state to save us from a powerful enemy . That was what this business with Alessandar and Ancar was all about , or have you forgotten that , too ? No one will want you or respect you outKingdom after dallying with a petty schemer like he is . And I , at least , have never been intimate with anyone that I did n't know , and who was n't willing to let me inside his thoughts . He would n't let you do that , would he ? Did n't that make you the least bit suspicious ? Lady 's Breasts , girl  --  where was your mind ? Your own Companion would n't have anything to do with him ! Did n't that tell you anything ? If you 're so hot to have a man between your legs , why the hell did n't you choose a fellow student or someone from the Circle ? They will at least never betray you and they know when to keep their mouths shut ! " Elspeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wailed . " Leave me alone ! It was n't like that at all ! I thought  --  I thought  --  he loved me ! I hate you  --  I never want to see you ever again ! " " That pleases me very well , " Talia snapped . " I 'm ashamed that I wasted so much of my time trying to help a damned fool . " She stalked out of the barn , vaulted onto Rolan 's back , and returned to the Palace without a backward glance . But before she was halfway there , she was already rueing half of what she had said . She reported to Selenay in an agony of self-accusation . The Queen was in her private quarters , which were as spartan as her public rooms were opulent . She had wrapped herself in a robe of old and shabby brown velveteen , nearly the same age and color asp567the couch she curled up on . Talia stood before her , unable to look her in the eyes , as she related the entire bitter tale . " Goddess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the situation if I 'd planned it out in advance , " she finished , rubbing one temple and very near to weeping with vexation . " I 'm as big an idiot as I accused Elspeth of being . I let all my training go flying merrily out the window , let my own problems get the better of me , and completely lost my temper . Maybe you 'd better send me back through the Collegium with the babies again . " " Just wait a moment . I 'm not sure that your reaction was the wrong one , and I 'm not sure that you did n't do the right thing , " the Queen replied thoughtfully , candlelight reflecting in her wide eyes . " Sit down , little friend , and hear me out . Firstly , we 've been very gentle with Elspeth up until now insofar as exposing her to the kind of emotional blackmail and double-dealing perfidy that we both know is fairly commonplace at Court . Well , now she 's learned that deceit can arrive packaged very attractively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt and frightened  --  but that will send the lesson home the more deeply . I believe you were correct in thinking that this experience will prevent her from making the same kind of mistakeI made . That 's not to say that you did n't overreact and say some things you should n't have , but on the whole , I think the good will outweigh the mistakes . " " How can you say that after the way I 've alienated her ? I 'm supposedto be her friend and counselor ! " " And when , in all the time you 've known her , have you ever lost your temper with her ? Not once . So she learns something else  --  that it 's possible to go too far with you , and that you 're as human and fallible as the rest of us . I doubt she 'll ever provoke you that far again . " " There is n't likely to be another chance , " Talia said bitterly . " Not the way I 've fouled things up . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since you 've been gone I 've gotten to know my daughter very well . She meant what she said . . . for now . She has a temper , but once it cools she does n't hold a grudge . And when she realizes that you were right  --  and acting in her defense  --  she 'll come around . If you were to disappearfor a while , I think she 'll eventually realize that while you did overreact , so did she . " The Queen pondered for a moment . " I think I have the perfect solution . Remember Alessandar 's marriage proposal ? I intended top568make a state visit there in the next few weeks , and I wanted to send an envoy on ahead to look the prince over . As my own personal advisor you would be perfect for that , the more especially as I intend to send Kris as well . I heard about the quarrel between Kris and Dirk , and I had figured on giving them a bit of time for things to cool as well . I was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night , so I 'll separate the pair by sending Kris off . " " That 's mended , " Talia sighed . " I still want to send Kris ; he has the manner and the blood to be acceptable , and I would as soon keep Kyril here . You and Kris worked outstandingly well as a team , and I trust your judgment completely . I think that rather than canceling the visit , I 'll move the date up and send the two of you on ahead to spy things out for me . I 'll take Elspeth with me . And I 'll have a word with Orthallen about those proteges of his . " Selenay 's eyes grew cold . " It 's about time he stopped being their defender and stopped letting them use his good name to get away with whatever they please . " Talia realized then that she had not told Selenay her belief that Orthallen had put the boy up to the attempted seduction . But  --  what proof did she have ? Nothing , except the vague image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have been because he was hoping to escape punishment by sheltering behind his protector . Best not to mention it , she thought wearily . I 'm not up to going through the same arguments I faced with Kris . " By the time we all meet again , " Selenay was saying , " Elspeth will have had time to think . Do you think you could be ready in the morning ? The sooner you drop out of Elspeth 's sight , the better . " " I could be ready in an hour , " Talia replied . " Although I 'm not sure you should be so quick to trust me after tonight . " " Talia , I trust you even more , " Selenay replied , as Talia seemed to read understanding in her eyes . " You 've come to me hot from the quarrel to claim it was all your fault  --  how many people , how many Heralds , even , would have done the same ? But you have n't told me what has set you so on edge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get caught in the middle of his feud with Dirk ? If you have problems with Kris , I 'll send a different Herald with you . " " Kris ? " Talia 's honest surprise seemed to relieve the Queen . " No , thank the Lady , we 've more than made up our differences , just as he and Dirk made up . Bright Havens , if anything he 'll help straighten out this awful tangle ! It 's nothing that ca n't be worked out with time , just like this row with Elspeth ; it 's just that the time it 's takingp569to set everything straight is driving me out of patience and out of temper . " " Good . Then the plan stands . You and Kris will leave in the morning . " " Selenay , if you do n't think it 's a bad idea . . . " Talia began hesitantly . " I doubt that it would be . What is it you 'd like to do ? " " I 'd like to write a note of apology to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt in my mind that I was partially in the wrong , that I overreacted , and that I said a great many hurtful things because I was unhappy and I wanted to hurt someone else . I certainly was far too hard on her . You can use your own judgment whether or not to give it to her , and when . " " It sounds reasonable to me , " Selenay replied , " although a bit unnecessary . We 'll be following a week or two behind you , and apologies are always more effective in person . " " That 's quite true  --  but you never know what 's likely to happen , and you may want to give it to her before you start off . I do n't like the idea of leaving unfinished business behind me , especially something as wretched as this . Who knows ? I might never get another chance . " " Bright Havens , dear ! I should hire you out as my official doomsayer ! " Selenay laughed , but it was a little uneasy . Talia shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm seeing everythingmiserable just because I 'm miserable . I will leave that note with you , but because the catling may well decide to be a human being again once I 've left . Now  --  are they expecting any two Heralds , or Dirk and Kyril ? Will there be any problem with me showing up ? " " The underlings are probably just expecting two Heralds , " Selenay said . " I had n't specified . I 'll send the appropriate papers with you , of course . The guards on Alessandar 's side of the Border will send the specifics on ahead of you . I 've heard he has some special way of relaying messages , faster than birds or couriers . I would appreciate it if you could find out more details on that , if it 's possible . It might not be . . . . " " It depends on whether it 's supposed to be kept secret from allies or not  --  or whether it 's a secret at all . We 'll do our best , " Talia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of us on this assignmentwill work rather well at ferreting secrets out . Anybody involved with state secrets will be nervous ; I can pick that up , andp570Kris can follow my anchor to Farsee what 's going on . My Queen , you are very sly . " " Me ? " Selenay contrived to look innocent , then caught her eyes squarely . " Are you sure you 're ready for this ? I wo n't send you if you do n't feel capable of political intrigue and all the rest that this will entail . It is likely to be simple and straightforward , but it could involve ferreting out secrets , and at the very least you 'll be dealing with the same amount of scheming you have here . " " I 'm ready , " Talia sighed . " It ca n't be worse than the mess I 've already been dealing with . "  |p571  " I FEEL LIKE I 'M RUNNING AWAY . " Talia 's voice was quiet , but in the hush of pre-dawn Kris had no trouble hearing her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' girth with a little grunt . Their Companions stood patiently side by side in the tackshed , as they had so many times during Talia 's internship , waiting for their Chosen to finish harnessing them . The rain that had blown up just past midnight had died away to nothing , but the skies were still overcast ; both Heralds wore their cloaks against the chill damp . Tantrisand Rolan were being decked out in full " formal " array ; the silver brightwork gleamed in the light from the lantern just above Tantris ' shoulder and the bridle bells tinkled softly as the Companionsshifted . The homey scent of leather and hay made Talia 's throat ache with tears she refused to shed . " Look , there is n't anything either of us can do here at the moment , right ? " Kris threw his saddlebags over Tantris ' hindquarters and fastened them to the saddle 's skirting . " Elspeth wo n't talk to you , and Dirk ca n't . So you might as well be doing something useful  --  something different . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the few weeks we 'll be gone , will there ? " " No , not really . " Talia had been very busy this past evening ; her lack of sleep was apparent from the dark circles under her eyes . " Destria is doing fine ; anything she needs now Vostel is more thanp572competent to give her . I talked to Alberich ; he took me to see Kyril . They promised me that they 'd keep an eye on your uncle  --  I 'm sorry , Kris . . . . " " Do n't apologize ; I 'm just a little surprised you managed to convinceKyril he needed watching . Tantris , stand , dammit ! " " I did n't , really , Alberich did . " " Huh . Alberich ? Nobody convinces him of anything ; he must have had reasons of his own to agree with you . " He digested this in silence for a moment . Tantris shifted over another step . " Alberich is going to have a word or two with Elspeth , too , " she continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran her hands down Rolan 's legs to confirm that the bindings on his pasterns and fetlocks were firm . " And Keren promised to beard Dirk in his lair as soon as she can bully her way past the Healers . So did Skif . " " Skif said as much to me . Poor Dirk , I could almost feel sorry for him . He 's not likely to get much sympathy from either of those two . " Tantris ' bridle bells tinkled as he shifted again . " Sympathy is n't what he needs , " she replied a little waspishly , straightening up . " He 's been wallowing in self-pity long enough . . . " her voice trailed off , and she concluded shamefacedly : " for that matter , so have I. " " Work is the best cure I know for self-pity , little bird , " Kris said , self-consciously . " And  --  hey ! " With that last step Tantris had managed to shift over far enough that Kris and Talia were trapped between the two Companions , breast-to-breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be nice . She 's having a hard time. : Kris sighed with exasperation , then looking down at Talia 's wistfuleyes , softened . " It 'll be all right , little bird  --  and you have every reason to feel sorry for yourself . " He kissed her softly on the forehead and the lips . She relaxed just a little , and leaned her head for a short moment on his shoulder . " I do n't know what I 've done to deserve a friend like you , " she sighed , then took hold of herself . " But we have a long road ahead of us  --  " Tantris had moved away so that they were no longer trapped , and Kris could hear him laughing in his mind . "  --  and we 've got a limitedtime to cover it , " Kris finished for her . " And since my Companionhas decided to cooperate again , we ought to get moving . " Hep573gave Tantris ' harness a final tug and swung into the saddle . " Ready to go ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took with them only what Tantris and Rolan could carry . They needed to carry no supplies ; they would be housed and fed at inns along the way until they reached the Border , and thereafter would be using the hostels of King Alessandar . They also needed to bring a minimum in the way of personal belongings . The Queen and her entourage would be following at a pace geared to her baggage train , and they would bring whatever might be required for the term of official visits . Selenay and Alessandar were long-time allies ; he and her father had been that rarest of things among rulers  --  personal friends . Although it was a slim chance , the possibility of Elspeth being willing to make a marriage with Alessandar 's own heir was not to be dismissed offhand . Alessandar had not been discouraged by Selenay 's initial reply to his offer  --  rather he had urged this visit on her , so that she and Elspeth could see Ancar for themselves . He had argued convincingly that such marriages took years to arrange ; even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her internship when it became a reality . Since Selenay had not seen the young man since he was an infant , on the occasion of his naming and her last state visit , she agreed . This would be the ideal time for such a visit . Since the Collegium was about to go into summer recess , she could bring Elspeth with her . She was still determined that Elspeth would not be forced into any marriage unless the safety of the entire realm rested on it . She was equally determined that any young man that Elspeth chose , be he royal or common , would at least be of the frame of mind to agree with the principles that governed her Kingdom . If possible , he should be of Heraldic material himself . Ideally , Elspeth 's consort would be someone who was either Chosen already or who would be Chosen once he was brought to the attention of the Companions . If this came to pass , it would fulfill Selenay 's highest hopes , for the Heir 's consort would be co-ruler if also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all was in readiness for her , Kris ' and Talia 's primary duty was to examine the proposed bridegroom  --  and to determine how his own people felt about him  --  for themselves ; and then give Selenay their opinions of his character . It was no small trust . This was all in the back of Talia 's mind as they rode away in the darkness before dawn . Troubling her thoughts was her feeling that ,  |p574in  spite of the importance of this mission , she was running away from unfinished business by accepting it . She had labored for hours over the simple note to Elspeth , tearing up dozens of false starts . It still was n't right ; she wished she 'd been able to find better words to explain why she had overreacted , and nothing she could say would unspeak some of the hurtful things she 'd said . The incident was evidence that she and Elspeth had drawn apart during Talia 's interning , and the rift that had come between them needed to be healed , and quickly . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd first returned . Then there was Dirk . . . She could n't help but think she was being cowardly . Anyone with any courage at all would have remained , despite everything . And yet  --  what could she truly do back there besides fret ? Kris was right ; Elspeth would refuse to speak with her , and Dirk was out of bounds in the Healers ' hands . It seemed appropriate that they rode away through darkness , and that the sky was so gloomy and overcast there was no bright dawn at all , merely a gradual lightening of the dark to gray , leaden daylight . Kris was not very happy with himself at the moment . : I have n't been doing too well by my friends lately , have I ? : he sent to Tantris ' backward-pointingears . : No , little brother , you have n't , : his Companion agreed . He sighed , and settled himself a little more comfortably in the saddle . Now that he looked back on it , there were things he should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way Talia felt  --  about Dirk , and about himself . When Dirk started acting oddly , he should have had it out with him . He should never have let things get to the point where Dirk was leaning on the bottle to cope . Lord and Lady , I 'd be willing to bet gold he thinks it 's me Talia 's in love with . Gods , gods , I 've been tearing his heart and soul into ragged bits and I never even noticed . No wonder he picked a fight with me , no wonder he was drinking . Ah , Dirk , my poor brother  --  I did it to you again . How am I going to make it up to you ? Then there was Talia . He should have believed that Talia was n't indulging in a grudge . He should have known , what with all the time he 'd spent with her , that she was n't inclined to hold grudges , even though she was n't inclined to forgive a hurt too easily . He should have believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not dislike . Alberich obviously believed her  --  and the Armsmasterwas hardly noted for making hasty judgments . : Might-have-beens do n't mend the broken pot , : Tantris said in his mind . : Little brother , why did n't you do these things ? : Good question . Kris thought about that one while the road passed under Tantris ' hooves . There were n't many folk out this early , so they had the road to themselves , and there was nothing to distract j him . One thing at a time . Why had n't he done anything about Dirk ? He came to the sobering conclusion that he had n't done anything because he had n't seen the problem until Dirk was drinking himself to sleep every night . And he had n't seen it because he was so I pleased with himself for the completion of a successful assignment on his own  --  so wrapped up in a glow of self-congratulation  --  that he had n't noticed anything else . He 'd been like a child on holiday ; selfishly intent only on his own pleasures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the nonce . Teaching the classes in Farseeing was so very easy for him that it was like having no duty at all , and he 'd been spending the rest of his time up to his eyebrows in his own pleasures . : Very good , : Tantris said dryly . : Now do n't go overboard in beating your breast about it . I was n't too remiss in enjoying myself , either . It had been a long time to be out  --  and Ahrodie and I missed each other. : : Hedonist , : Kris sent , a little relieved that his Companion was beingso reasonable . : Not really . We 're as close as you and Dirk  --  in a slightly different fashion . More like you and Talia , really. : Yes , Talia  --  it was easy to figure out why he 'd been so slow to see her plight . Orthallen was , in all honesty , a politician , a schemer , and power-hungry . Kris had been forced to defend his uncle 's actionsto other Heralds more than once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrongdoing . Kris knew Orthallen never did anything for just one reason ; yes , he might well manage to gain a little more power , influence , or put someone in his debt by the things he did , but there was always a profit for the Kingdom as well . Heralds though  --  the use of authority for personal benefit bothered them , probably because such usage was forbidden them , both by training and by inclination . Most Heralds were n't highborn , and did n't grow up with the intrigue and politics that were a part of the rhythm of Court life . Things Kris accepted matter/of-factly disgusted them . But the fact was that Heralds were very sheltered creatures  --  except the ones who lived and worked in the Court , or were highborn . Court politics were a reality most Heralds could remain blissfully unaware of , for they dealt only with the highest level of Court life  --  the Queen , her immediate entourage , and the Seniors  --  where for all intents and purposes , the politicking did n't exist . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the competition was fiercest . And it was very possible he had seen only the political implications of the ascension of the new Queen 's Own . More than possible . Most likely . . . Which meant he 'd seen Talia as a political rival to be trimmed down ; seen her only as a political rival . Her duties and responsibilitiesas a Herald  --  Orthallen probably did n't understand them , and certainly discounted them as irrelevant . Old Talamir had been no threat to Orthallen , but this quick , intelligent , young woman was . All of which boiled down to the fact that Talia was likely deadaccuratein reading Orthallen 's motives toward her . Yes , Kris had dealt with fellow Heralds ' censure of his uncle before . But Talia 's accusations had been different  --  and he had been as shocked by the idea that a member of his family could be suspected of real wrongdoing as Talia had been that a Herald was accused of it . He 'd taken it almost as an attack on himself , and had reacted just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind to me before this , : Kris told Tantris , just a hint of accusation flavoring the thought . : It does n't work that way , little brother , : Tantris replied , : and you know that perfectly well . We only give advice when we 're asked for it . It is n't our job to interfere in your personal lives . How do you think poor Ahrodie was feeling , with her Chosen making a muck of things and not even talking to her , hm ? And Bolan ca n't even properlytalk with his Chosen . But now that you are finally asking  --  : : Impart to me your deathless wisdom. : : Now , now , there 's no need to be sarcastic . As it happens , I do n't like Orthallen either , but he 's never given anyone any real evidence of ill-will before this . All I 've ever had to go on were my instincts. : : Which are far better than any human 's , : Kris reminded him . : Well , do n't blame yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when someone like Talia insists on a thing , it 's probably a good idea to lay aside your feelings about it and consider it as dispassionately as possible . Now that she 's got that Gift of hers in full control , her instincts in these matters are as good as mine. :  |p577:Yes  , graybeard , : Kris thought , his good humor somewhat restored by the fact that Tantris was n't trying to make him feel guilty about the mess . : Graybeard , am I ? : Tantris snorted and shook his mane . : We 'll see about that. : And he performed a little caracole , a half-buck that shook Kris ' bones , and a kick or two before settling back down to his original steady pace . While Rolan could not Mindspeak Talia as Tantris could Kris , he was making his feelings abundantly clear . It was quite plain to Talia that her Companion thought she was indulging in a good deal more self-pity than the occasion warranted . Perversely , his disapproval made her feel all the sorrier for herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her wallow in her misery to her heart 's content . The weather , unseasonable for the edge of summer , was certainly cooperating ; it was a perfect day for being depressed . The chill , leaden skies threatened rain , but it never quite made up its mind to fall . The few people they met on the roadway were taciturn and scant in their greetings . The threat of rainfall made folk in the villagesthey passed inclined to stay indoors . Because they were traveling light , they would make the best possibletime to the Border , even though they would be stopping to rest at night . According to Kyril , it was probable that they would proceedstill on their own as far as the capital , since the Companions would be able to make far better time than any steeds the King could send with an escort . Which meant , given the probable speed of Selenay and her entourage , they would have several days at least to assess the prince and the situation before one of them rode back to meet the Queen on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Queen 's Own , was the betterchoice for envoy . Although her reason acknowledged the wisdomof this , her emotions rebelled , wanting it to be her who made that first contact with Selenay  --  and with Elspeth  --  and possibly , with Dirk , if he were well enough by then . Nothing was going as she would have chosen ; and on top of it all , she had been experiencing an odd foreboding about this trip from the moment Selenay mentioned it . There was no reason for it , yet she could n't shake it . It was as if she were riding from bad into worse , and there was no way to stop what was coming . Talia remained turned inward , determined to control her own in/ternal turmoil by herself . Weeping on Kris ' shoulder would accomplishnothing . Rolan was a solace  --  but this was a matter of dealing with her own emotions and her own control . A Herald , she told herself for the thousandth time , was supposed to be self-sufficient , able to cope no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Havens , control herself  --  there was no excuse for her own emotional weakness . She had learned to control her Gift  --  she would learn to school her emotions to the same degree . The hard pace they were setting left little opportunity for conversation , but Kris was very aware of her unhappiness . Talia had told him in detail about the confrontation with the Heir as they were saddling up . He was sadly aware that there was little he could do to help her ; it was extremely frustrating to see her in such emotional pain and be unable to do anything constructive about it . Not long ago , he would have fled the prospect of emotional demands . Now in the light of this morning 's introspection his sole regret was that he could not find some way to help . When she 'd lost control over her Gift , there had been something he could do . He was a teacher ; he knew the fundamentals of training any Gift , and he had Tantris and Rolan to help him with the specificsof hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one small way in which he could help her . If he talked to his uncle , perhaps he could make him understand that Talia was not a political threat . With that pressure off , the problem of dealing with Elspeth and Dirk might assume more manageableproportions . They stopped for a brief lunch at an inn , but mindful of the time constraints they were under , they ate it standing in the stable-yard . " How are you doing so far ? " he asked around a mouthful of meat pie . " I 'm all right , " she replied . She 'd already bolted down her portionso fast she could n't have tasted it . Now she was giving Rolan a brisk rubdown , and was putting far more energy into Rolan 's curryingthan was strictly necessary . " Well I know you have n't ridden much at forced pace ; if you have any problems , let me know . " " I will , " was her only reply . He tried again . " I hope the weather breaks ; it 's bad for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crops . " " Uh-huh . "  |p579  " We 'll have to ride right up until dark to make Trevale , but the inn there should make up for the ride . I 've been there before . " He waited . No response . " Think you can make it that far ? " " Yes . " " Their wine is good . Their beer is better . " " Oh . " " Their hearthcats have two tails . " " Uh-huh . " He gave up . They stopped long after dark when Kris was beginning to go numb in his legs , and staggered into an inn neither of them really saw . The innkeeper saw that both of them were exhausted , and wisely kept his other customers away from them , giving them a table right on the hearth and a good dinner . The inn was a big one , and catered to traders , carters , and other mercantile travel . The common room was nearly full , and noisy enough that Kris did not attempt conversation . Talia was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment , and she rather hoped he 'd ignore her until she was . After a meal which she did not even taste and choked down only because she needed to fuel her body , they went straight to their beds . She was able to force herself to sleep , but she could do nothing about her dreams . They were tortured and nightmarish , and not at all restful . They again left before dawn , rising before any of the other guests of the inn , breaking their fast with hot bread and milk before swingingup into their saddles and resuming the journey . Talia , having found no answers within , began resolutely turning her attention without . The skies had begun clearing , and by late morning they were able to roll up their cloaks and fasten them behind their saddles . When birds began voicing their songs , her spirits finally began to lighten . By noon she had managed to regain enough of her good humor to speak normally with Kris , and the whole mess she 'd left behind her began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint foreboding , but in the bright sunlight it seemed hardly more than the remnants of her nightmares . Toward midday Talia suddenly perked up and became more like her old self , for which Kris was very grateful . Riding next to a person who strongly resembled the undead of the tales was not his idea of the way to make a journey.  |p580Di|plomatic  missions were not entirely new to Kris , though he 'd not been senior Herald before . This was Talia 's first stint as an envoy , and they really needed to talk about it while it was possible to do so unobserved . Kris was relieved by her apparent return to normal , and ventured a tentative prompting . She responded immediately with a flood of questions , and that was more like the Talia he knew , but he could not help but note ( with a feeling of profound sympathy ) her darkcircledeyes . While he was no Empath , he knew her sleep must have been scant . By the time they reached the Border itself at the end of a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footing between them . They had discussed every contingency that they could think of between them ( ranging from the possibility that Ancar should seem to be perfect in every way , to the possibility that he was a worse maritalprospect than Selenay 's late consort ) and talked over graceful ways to get them all out if the latter should be the case . Kris was fairly sure she was ready to face whatever the fates should throw at her . As they rounded a curve , late in the afternoon of the fourth day of the journey , Talia got her first sight of the Border . The Border itself , here where two civilized and allied countries touched , was manned by small outposts from each Kingdom . On the Valdemar side stood a small building , a few feet from the road , and a few feet from the simple bar that marked the Border itself . It served as dwelling and office for the two pairs of Guardsfolk stationed there . The pair on duty were checking the papers of an incoming trader ; they looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two Heralds . The taller of the two left the trader 's wagon and took down the bar for them , waving them through with an elaborate mock bow . A few lengths farther on was a proper gate , marking Alessandar 's side of the Border . It was manned by another pair of guards , this time in the black-and-gold uniforms of Alessandar 's army . With them was a young man in a slightly more elaborate uniform ; a Captainof Alessandar 's army . The Captain was young , friendly , and quite handsome ; he passed them in without more than a cursory glance at their credentials . " I 've been waiting for you , " he told them , " but I truly did n't expect you here this soon . You must have made very good time . "  |p581  " Fairly good , " Kris replied , " and we started out a bit sooner than planned . We 've been out in the field for the last year or so . Field Heralds are used to being ready to go at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with soft bunks at Court , hm ? " the Captain grinned . " Same with us . That lot stationed at Court could n't have a half-day of maneuvers without a full baggage train and enough suppliesto feed a town . Well , I do have some basic orders about what to do with you . . . " " You do ? " Talia said , raising her eyebrows in surprise . " Oh , it is n't much  --  just wait until you arrive , then inform the capital . " Talia recalled then what Selenay had said , that Alessandar was rumored to have some new system of passing messages swiftly . She also remembered that Selenay had asked her to find out what she could about it . Evidently Kris had gotten similar instructions . " Now how are you going to get further instructions about us in any reasonable amount of time ? " Kris asked . " I know the nearest authority is several days away on horseback , and you do n't have Heralds to carry messages quickly . " The young Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he replied , his brown eyes frank . " In fact , I would be honored to show you , if you are n't too tired . " " Not likely  --  not when you 're offering to show us what sounds like magic ! " The Captain laughed . " From what I understand , you 're fine ones to talk about wonders and magic ! Well , one man 's magic is another man 's commonplace , so they say . Come along then , and I 'll show you . " Out of courtesy to him , since he was afoot , Talia and Kris dismountedand walked with him up the packed-gravel roadway to his outpost ; a building much bigger than the one on the Valdemar side , and shaded on three sides by trees . " Will it interest you to know that I may very well get my orders within a matter of hours , if someone is found of high enough rank to issue them before the sun sets ? " " That 's amazing ! We ca n't even do that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do with it ? " " You see the tower attached to the outpost ? " He shook dark hair out of his eyes as he pointed to a slim , skeletal edifice of gray wood . This tower rose several feet above the treetops , and was anchored onp582one side to the main barracks of the Border station . It had had both of them puzzled since it seemed to have no real use except perhaps as a lookout point . " I must admit we were wondering about that , " Kris told him . " Are forest fires that much of a danger around here ? I would n't have thought so , what with all the land under cultivation . " " Oh , it 's not a firetower , though that 's where the design is from . " The young Captain laughed . " Come up to the top with me , and I 'll show you something to set you on your ears . " They followed him up the series of ladders that led to the broad platform on the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything out of the ordinary  --  just two men in the black uniform tunics of Alessandar 's army , and an enormous concave mirror , as wide as Talia was tall . Although it was not quite perfect , its surface a bit wavering , it was an impressive piece of workmanship . Talia marveled at the skill that had gone into first producing and then silveringsuch an enormous piece of glass . The mirror stood on a pivoting pedestal , and as they watched , one of the two men turned it until it reflected a beam of the westering sunlight at the southwestern corner of the platform . When he 'd done that , the second man picked up a smaller mirror about three handspans across and took his position in the beam of reflected light . That was when Talia realized just how they were going to pull off the trick . It was a very clever variant on the old scheme of signaling across distance by means of the sun flashing off a reflective object . It was clever because in this case there was no need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you needed to send a message . The Captain smiled broadly as he saw understanding in their faces . " It was the idea of some savant in Ancar 's entourage . We started building these towers last year at all the outposts ; when we realized how useful they are we sped up the building and put towersup as fast as we could get the mirrors for them . We have relay towers all across the Kingdom now , " he continued , with cheerful pride . " We can transmit a message from one end of the Kingdom to the other in a matter of hours . That 's rather better than you Heralds can do , from what I understand . " " That 's quite true , but anyone who knows your code has no troublein learning the content of any messages you send , " Kris pointed out . " That makes it a bit difficult to keep anything secret , does n't it ? "  |p583The  Captain laughed . " In that case , the couriers need never fret that there will be no job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man holding the smaller mirror , " tell them down the line that Queen Selenay of Valdemar 's two envoys are here , and waiting for instructions on how to proceed . " " Sir ! " The signalman saluted smartly , and carried out his orders . In the far distance the Heralds could just barely make out what might be the top of another tower above the treetops . Shortly after their man had completed his message , a series of flashes winked back at them from this point . " He 's repeating our entire message back to us , " the Captain explained . " We started this check after a few too many misreadings had caused some serious tangles . Now if he 's mistaken any of it , we can correct him before he sends it on . " " Sir . Message correct , sir , " the signalman replied . " Send the confirmation , " the Captain ordered , then continued his commentary . " Now the closer you get to any of the major cities , especially the capital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes sure that several incoming messages can be handled at once . If the originator does n't get confirmation , he assumes that there was a momentary jam-up , and keeps sending until he does . " " It 's really brilliant , " Talia said , and she and the Captain exchanged a grin at her pun , " but what do you do on cloudy days or at night ? " He laughed . " We go back to the old , reliable courier system in bad weather . We back it up by making our posting stations part of the tower system , so as soon as the clouds break or the sun rises , the message can be relayed . Even when conditions have been at their worst the towers usually still manage to beat the courier . At night , of course , we can signal with lanterns , but that wo n't be of any help in this case , since no one is going to want to trouble envoys with ordersafter they 've presumably retired . That 's assuming anyone highbornenough to issue those orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun sets ! " They followed him back down the ladders . Once back on the ground , since neither of them showed any signs of fatigue , he gave them a tour of the post that lasted until darkness fell . Talia was intrigued , and not just by the signal towers . This was more than simply a Border-guard station ; there was a company of Alessandar 's army on permanent duty here . When not patrolling the road for bandits or standing watch on the relay tower , the men ( there werep584no women in Alessandar 's army ) performed policing functions for local villages . It was an interesting contrast to the Valdemar system , where Selenay 's soldiery was kept in central locations , and shifted about at need . But then , Alessandar had a much larger standing army . In addition to the army company , there were four Healers  --  all women  --  permanently assigned here . There were three buildings , not including the tower ; the barracks , the Border station where the Healers lived and where Customs checks were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a kind of all-purposebuilding that included the kitchen and storage facilities . " Well , " the Captain said with resignation , when the tour was over and no one had appeared from the tower with a message . " It looks like the folks at the other end could n't find anyone with enough authority to issue orders about you before it became too late . That means you 'll have to spend the night here  --  unless you 'd rather recrossthe Border ? " " Here will be fine , providing it 's no imposition , " Kris answered . The Captain looked doubtfully from Kris to Talia and back again , and coughed politely . " I have n't got private quarters for you , " he said a bit awkwardly . " I could easily find you space in the barracks , of course , and the young lady could take a bed with the Healers , since they 're all women . But if you 'd rather not be separated . . . . " Captain , Herald Talia and I are colleagues , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could read his amusement at the Captain 's embarrassment . " Your arrangements are perfectly fine , " Talia said smoothly . " We 're both used to barracks-style quarters ; I promise you that they 're quite a luxury compared with some of the Waystations I 've spent my nights in . " Talia had been careful to use " I " instead of " we " in speaking of the Waystations . She saw out of the corner of her eye Kris winking at her to congratulate her on her tact . " If that 's the case , I 'll escort you to the officer 's mess for some dinner , " the Captain replied , apparently relieved that they 'd made no awkwardness over the situation . His attitude made Talia wonder if other guests at this outpost had been less than cooperative , or if it was simply that he 'd heard some of the more exaggerated tales about Heralds . While somewhat restrained by the presence of outsiders , the of/ficers were a very congenial lot . They were terribly curious about Heralds , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as any child 's . If all of Alessandar 's people were as open-handed and content with their lot as these men were , Talia was inclined to think he was every bit as good a ruler as Selenay . Although Kris got a real bed , Talia had to make do with a cot in the Healer 's quarters . She did n't mind in the least . The nightmares that had plagued her nightly all the way here had left her so weary she thought that she could quite probably sleep on a slab of stone . This night , however , the nightmares seemed to have been partiallythwarted . That might have been due to the soothing presence of the Healers bedded all around her . After all , she was an Empath ; Kris was not . There had been enough bad fortune this spring that it was possible she might well have been picking up the general air of disaster everyone was sharing lately . She 'd thought she 'd made her shields strong enough to block just about anything , but she had been stressed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the nightmares went away might have been just because she had worn herself out past the point of being disturbed by them . For whatever reason , she slept soundly for the first time since leaving , and had only the vaguest memories of disturbing dreams in the morning.  |p586IF  KRIS HAD BEEN DEAF , HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP THROUGH THE NOISE OFthe night guards coming in and the day guards getting up . Since he was n't , he made a virtue of the inevitable and got up with them . He found Talia , still sleepy-eyed , waiting for him in the mess hall ; she 'd had the foresight to claim two breakfasts from the cook . Their host put in an appearance just as they were finishing . " Well , I 've got your instructions . I 'm to give you maps , and you 're not to wait for an escort but to go on to the capital . You 're to check in with relay stations at sunset before you stop for the night . " " Sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to get on  --  not that your hospitality is n't appreciated , but I 'd rather not strain your resources . Just as well we 're not going to have to wait for an escort . " " I 'll admit I was glad to hear I did n't need to supply you with one , " their host said frankly . " I 'm shorthanded enough , and if half of what I 've heard is true , none of our beasts could ever hope to keep pace with yours , anyway . " " It 's true enough , " Kris replied with pardonable pride . " There is n't a horse born that can match the speed and endurance of a Companion . " " All right , what you 'll do is follow the main road to the capital  --  it 's easy enough  --  and stay overnight at Alessandar 's hostels . They 'll always be on the main square of town ; there 'll be a Guardpostp587nearby , and they 'll look like inns . The only difference between a hostel and an inn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a crown . Oh  --  you do speak our language , do n't you ? " " Perfectly , " Kris replied in Hardornen . " Oh , good  --  I thought they would n't have sent anybody that did n't , but you never know  --  and once you get a few miles off the Border nobody speaks Valdemaren . " " I ca n't say that surprises me too much , " Talia put in , in slow , clear Hardornen . " Once you get a few miles off our Border no one except Heralds speaks yours ! " " Right then , you can be on your way as soon as you 're ready . Here 's your map , " he handed Kris a folded packet , " and best of luck to you . " " Thanks , " Kris said , both of them rising and heading for the door . " And do n't forget , " he called after them as they headed for the stables , " Check in with the relay towers every night . The capital wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first day passed without incident . Alessandar 's people seemed as content as Selenay 's ; they were friendly , and looked quite prosperous , at least from a distance . " Is n't there supposed to be a village along here soon ? " Talia asked around noon . Kris pulled the map they 'd been given out of his beltpouch and consulted it . " Assuming I have n't been misreading this  --  let 's see if we can find a native . " One more turning of the road brought them to a grove of trees in the road-side corner of a fenced field . Beneath those trees was a group that could have been exchanged for farmers of Valdemar without anyone noticing the difference . They were stolidly munchingtheir way through a dinner of thick , coarse bread and cheese , but when one of them noticed that the two Heralds were approaching them with purpose , he stood , brushed crumbs off his linen smock , and met them halfway . " Eh , sir , and can I be of any help to ye ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . " I 'm not quite used to this map , " Kris replied , " And I wonder if you could tell me how far it is to Southford ? " " That be just a league or so a-down the road ; there 's that hill yonder in the way , or ye could see it from here . " The man grinned . " A'course , if the hill bai n't there , ye would n't have to ask , eh ? "  |p588Kris  laughed along with him . " That 's only true , " he said , " And thank you . " " Nice man , " Talia commented when Kris returned to her side . " He could have been one of ours . " She squinted across the fields of swiftly-growing green grain , and Kris followed her gaze . " They seem to be thriving , too . So far Alessandar gets high marks from me . " " Ah , " Kris replied , " But it is n't Alessandar that 's the prospective bridegroom . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sober one . " And I wish I did n't know so many tales of black-sheep sons . . . . " They were to stay only at the hostels , or so their orders went , so as sunset neared they checked the map for the first town ahead of them likely to have one . The hostels were an innovation of Alessandar 's , and were meant to serve as a courtesy to those moving about his Kingdom on official business . They were rather like well-run inns , save that there was no fee . Court officials , envoys of other Kingdoms , and clergy were permitted unlimited use of these facilities . They first reported their progress to one of the relay stations in a village along the way , as had been requested . The station was easy enough to find , as it towered over every other structure in the village . " Will ye be stayin ' here , or movin ' on past dark ? " asked the grizzledveteran who greeted them . " Moving on , " Talia replied , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " She looked to Kris for confirmation . He checked the map and nodded . " That 's a ways  --  but you know best . Guess the tales ' bout them horses o ' yours must be true . " He looked over Rolan and Tantris with an appraising and approving eye . " Useta be cavalry , meself . Ca n't say I 've ever seen neater beasts . Ye came all the way from the Border since this mornin ' ? " Rolan and Tantris preened under his admiring gaze and curvetted a little , showing off . " That we did , sir , " Kris answered with a smile . " Do n't look winded  --  do n't even look tired  --  just exercised a mite . Lord Sun , I 'd not have believed it if I had n't a ' seen it . Well if ye can make that kinda time , yell be at the Crossings ' bout a candlemark after sunset . Hostel 's in the town square , right-hand side as you come in. "  |p589  " Many thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads back to the road . " Fair wind at yer back ! " he called after them , his admiring gaze following them until they were out of sight . The hostel was indeed like an inn , complete with innkeeper . They had been told that the accommodations were as plain as the food , but adequate . They showed their credentials to the businesslike Hostelmaster when they dismounted at the door . He examined them quite carefully , paying close attention to the seals of Valdemar and Hardorn . When he was satisfied that they were genuine , he summoned a stableboywith a single word . The lad came at a run to take the Companions , and the Hostelmaster waved them inside . The common room was hot , smoky , and crowded , and it took them a little time to find themselves places at smooth , worn wooden trestle-tables . Finally Talia squeezed in beside a pair of travelers in priestly garb  --  apparently from the rival sects of Kindas Sun-Kindler and Tembor Earth-Shaker . They were having a spirited discussion of the deficiencies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took her place on the very end of the bench . Kris sat opposite her , with his neighbor a thin , clerkly-looking sort with ink-I stained fingers , whose sole interest was the contents of the stonewareplatter in front of him . A harried serving girl placed similar platters before the two Heralds ; meat , bread , and stewed vegetables . A boy followed her with a tray of wooden mugs of thin ale , and the keys to their rooms . They ate quickly ; the food was n't anything to linger over , and Talia 's bench , at least , was so crowded she had barely enough room to perch . And there were more people coming in , waiting with expressions of impatience for seats . With their hunger appeased , they took their keys and their mugs to the other side of the lantern-lit room , where there was a fire and a number of benches and settles scattered about . Talia felt curious eyes on them  --  not hostile , just curious . She decided that they were the only foreigners among the guests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She picked a seat , and took it quickly , feeling very conspicuous in her white uniformthat stood out so sharply in the otherwise dark room . " Heralds out of Valdemar , be you ? " asked a portly fellow in brown velvet as Kris took a corner of a bench.  |p590  " You have us rightly , good sir , " Talia answered him . " Do n't see Heralds often . " His inquisitive glance left no doubt but that he was curious about what brought them . " You should be seeing more before summer 's over , " Talia replied with what she hoped was just enough friendliness . " Queen Selenay will be making a visit to your King . We 're here to help get things ready for her . " " Ah ? " he replied , his interest piqued . " That so ? Well  --  maybe things be taking a turn for the better , after all . " " Have things been bad lately ? " she asked as casually as possible . " Valdemar 's had its share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , aye  --  floods and all , " he replied , a bit too hastily , and turned to the men on the other side of him , joining the conversation in progress . " ' Scuse me , milady , but could you tell me what the grain prices look to be on your side of the Border ? " A tall , thin merchant interposedhimself between Talia and the man she had first spoken to , and it would have been plain rudeness to ignore him . He kept her engaged with so many questions that she had no chance to ask any of her own . Finally she 'd had enough of being monopolized , and signaled Kris that she was ready to leave . When Kris yawned , pled fatigue , and rose to head for his room and bed , Talia followed . The guest rooms were monklike cells arrangedalong the walls ; they had no fireplaces or windows , but slits in the walls near the ceiling gave adequate ventilation . Kris raised one eyebrow interrogatively at her as he unlocked his door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd learned something interesting , and the hand motion that meant they 'd talk about it later . Even without a window , Talia knew when it was sunrise . She was n't much surprised to discover that Kris had beaten her to breakfastby a few minutes . No one else was even stirring . She did n't pay much attention to what she was eating ; some kind of grain porridge with nuts and mushrooms , she thought . It was as bland as the dinnerhad been . " The boy is harnessing for us , " Kris said around a mouthful . " We can be on the road as soon as you 're ready . " She washed down the last bite of the gluey stuff with a quick gulp of unsweetened tea . " I 'm ready . " " Then let 's get going . "  |p591They  cantered out the village until they reached the outskirts beforesettling back to a slower pace . " Well ? " Kris asked , when they were well out of earshot of the village . " There 's something not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I ca n't put my finger on anything . All I 've got is a feeling  --  and that no one wants to talk about bad times ' around here . It may just be an isolated case of discontent  --  " She shook her head , suddenly feeling dizzy . " What 's the matter ? " " I do n't  --  know . I feel a little funny all of a sudden . " " You want to stop a minute ? " Kris asked , sounding concerned . She was about to say " no " when another wave of disorientation hit . " I think I 'd better  --  " Their Companions moved over to the grassy verge of the road on their own . Rolan braced all four legs and stood rock-still , while waves of dizziness washed over her . She did n't dismount  --  she did n't dare ; she was afraid she would n't be able to get back up again . She just clung to the saddle , and hoped she would n't fall off . " Want to go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Healer ? " " N-no . I do n't think so . I do n't know  --  " The disorientation did n't seem quite so bad , after a bit . " I think it 's going away by itself . " Then , as the dizziness faded , so did the empathic awareness of those around her ; an awareness she always had , no matter how tightly shielded . " Goddess ! " Her eyes snapped open and she looked frantically around her , as Kris grabbed her elbow , anxiously . " It 's  --  " She unshielded . It was the same . She could sense nothing , not even Kris , beside her . " It 's gone ! My Gift  --  " Then it was back  --  redoubled . And she , unshielded and wide open , bent over in physical pain at the mental clamor of what seemed to be thousands of people . Hastily she shielded back downOnly to have the clamor vanish again . She remained bent over , head in hands . " Kris  --  Kris , what 's happening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her as best he could from his saddle . " I do n't know , " he said tightly , " I  --  wait  --  was n't there some kind of mushroomin that glop they fed us ? " " I  --  " she tried to think . " Yes . Maybe . "  |p592  " Goatsfoot , " he said grimly . " It has to be . That 's why you 're gettinghit and I 'm not . " " Goatsfoot ? That  --  " She sat up slowly , blinking tears away . " That 's the stuff that scrambles Gifts , is n't it ? I thought it was rare  --  " " Only Thoughtsensing and Empathy and yes , it is rare in most places . It 's not common around here , but it 's not rare either , and it 's been a wet spring , just what goatsfoot likes . The damned fools must have gotten hold of a lot and just chucked it in the food without checking beyond seeing that it was edible . " She was able to think a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything I read pretty well worthless for the next couple of days , is n't it ? " He grimaced . " Do n't even try ; it 'll make you sick . Those damned fools were just lucky they did n't have a Healer overnighting there ! If you can ride , I think we 'd better go back  --  " " I can ride , if we take it easy . Why ? " He had already turned Tantris ' head back the way they had come . " What if they have more of that stuff  --  and a Healer as a guest to-night ? " " Great good gods ! " She let Rolan follow in Kris ' wake . It was n't more than a league back ; they had n't traveled far before the effect of the fungus hit her . She fought off successive waves of dizziness and disorientation , and was vaguely aware that they 'd stopped and Kris was giving someone a sharp-tongued dressingdown . She caught frantic apology ; it seemed genuine enough  --  what her Gift was feeding at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear , apprehension , guilt  --  followed immediately by waves of delirious joy , intense sexual arousal , and overwhelming hunger . Finally , another " blank " moment , and she drew a shuddering breath of relief . " Little bird ? " She opened her eyes to look down on Kris standing at her right stirrup . " Do you want to stay here ? I can go back to the signal tower and get them to send a message that you 've been taken ill  --  and whose fault it is . " " No  --  no . I 'll be better  --  better away from people . You can shield ; they ca n't . I wo n't fall off ; Rolan wo n't let me . " " If that 's the way you want it . .  |p593  " Please  --  " She closed her eyes . " Let 's get out of here  --  " She heard him mount ; felt Rolan start off after him . She did n't open her eyes ; the disorientation did n't seem so bad when she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance increased between herself and the village , the worst of the effects decreased . She felt a second shield snap up around her  --  Kris '  --  then a third  --  Rolan'sShe opened her eyes cautiously . It was like looking up through water , but bearable . She felt Kris touch her arm , and saw that he was riding beside her . " This could n't have been on purpose , " she asked , slowly , " Could it ? " He gave the idea serious thought ; she could tell by the blank expression on his face . " I do n't think so , " he said at last . " They could n't have known what hostel we 'd overnight in , and they could n't have counted on goatsfoot being available . They swore they only had that one batch , that it was in a lot of edible fungus some boy sold them this morning . I made them dump the rest of the porridgein the pig trough . No , I think it 's just a damned bad accident . Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a kind of internal tally . " Yes . " " All right , then let 's get on with it . I 'd like to get you to bed as early as we can . " But Talia wondered  --  because with the relay towers , someone could have known what hostel they intended to stay in  --  and as a former farmchild , she knew that some mushrooms could be preservedindefinitely when dried . . . . Kris pushed both of them to the limit , hoping to get Talia into the haven of a bed long before sundown . He managed ; better still , that night they were the only travelers making use of the hostel . The quiet did her some good ; so did the rest . Unfortunately , he knew from old lessons that there was no remedy for goatsfoot poisoning except time . The accident was more than annoying ; he really needed her abilitieson this trip . Without them , they 'd have to go on wit alone . With a good night 's sleep she was back to normal  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either completely blocked , or so wide open she could n't sort out what emotion was coming from whom . Neither one of them wanted her to try projecting under these con/ditions . They could n't predict what would happen and did n't really want to find out . So he pushed to make the best time they could to the next hostel  --  and hoped they could make training , wit , and skills serve . When Kris stopped to try to inquire about hostels at noon , people seemed overly quiet , and not inclined to talk much beyond the simplecourtesy of answering their questions . And the townspeople in the hamlet they finally reached were the same ; hurrying to be about their business and showing only furtive curiosity about the strangerswho had ridden in . That night the Guard at the relay station they reported to was cold and somewhat brusque , and advised them against changing their plans for stopping at Ilderhaven . " Them at the capital need to know where ye be ; they 'll be takin ' it amiss if they ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making it sound as if " they " would be taking it more than " amiss " if the Heralds changed their stated plans . Kris exchanged a flickering , sober glance with his partner , but made no retort . At the hostel , which held a scant handful of travelers , they split up , each taking a likely prospect , and began trying to eke a little more information out of them . Talia had chosen a shy priestess of one of the Moon-oriented orders , and hoped she could get something useful out of her without her Gift . She began her conversation with ordinary enough exchanges ; the difficulties women faced when making long journeys , commiserationover the fact that men in authority seemed to take them 1 ightly  --  Hostelmasters serving the men in the room first , no matter what the order of their arrival was , and much more in the same vein . Carefully , over the entire evening , she began steering the talk to the topics that seemed to be the most sensitive . " Your King  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruler , " Talia said casually , when the topic of Alessandar came up . " From what I can see , everyone seems to be prospering . That ought to be making for good days with your temple . " " Oh , yes . . . Alessandar is a fine ruler to us ; things have never been better . . . " The priestess trailed off into hesitant uncertainty . " And he has a fine , strong son to follow him ? Or so I 'm told . "  |p595  " Yes , yes , Ancar is strong enough . . . has there been much flooding in Valdemar ? We 've never seen the like of it this spring . " Had there been uneasiness when the woman spoke Ancar 's name ? " Flooding , for fair . Crops and herds wiped out , rivers changing course even . Young Elspeth has been at the Queen to let her be about the countryside doing what she can  --  but of course that 's out of the question while she 's still in schooling . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be the Queen 's own right hand . Surely Ancar has been seeing to things for his father ? " " No . . . no , not really . The . . . the factors take care of all that , you know . And . . . we really do n't want to be seeing Ancar . . . it is n't fitting for someone in his station to be going among the commonfolk . He has his own Court  --  has since he came of age , you know . He has  --  other interests . " " Ah , " Talia replied , and allowed the conversation to turn to anothertopic . " Not very conclusive , " Kris mused . " But it 's looking odd . " Talia nodded ; they 'd waited again until they were on the road before talking . " I 've gotten a similar sort of impression , " he began . " As if things were reasonably well now , but that folk are not entirelysure of what the morrow might bring . " " Damn that goatsfoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this goes  --  if it 's more than just the usual worries about better the straw king than the lion king '  --  gods , we need your Gift ! " " It 's still not reliable , " she told him regretfully . " Well , we just have to muddle along on our own . " He sighed . " This is exactly the kind of reason we 've been sent on ahead , and we have to have clearer information than we 've got . Selenay ca n't act on anything this vague . " " I know , " she said , biting her lip . " I know . " That night Talia tackled an elderly clerk . When she brought up the topic of the King , he was voluble in his praise of Alessandar . " Look at these hostels  --  wonderful idea , wonderful ! I remember when I was just a lad , my first post as tax-collector  --  Lord Sun , the inns I had to stay in , verminous , filthy , and costing so high you wondered why they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done with it ! And he 's cleaned out most of the brigands and robbers ,  |p596him  and his Army ; Karse dare n't even think about invading anymore . Oh , aye , he 's a great King  --  but he 's old . . . " " Surely Ancar  --  " " Well , that 's as may be . The Prince is a one for protocol and position ; he does n't seem to be as open-handed as his sire . And there 's the rumors . . . . " " Oh ? " " Oh , you know , young m'lady  --  there 's always rumors . " Indeed there were rumors ; and now Kris actually suspected listeners , so he signaled Talia to wait to talk until they were on an open stretch of road the next day , with no one else near . She told him what she 'd gotten , and what she 'd guessed . " So Ancar has his own little Court , hm ? " Kris mused . " And his own circle of followers and hangers-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that . Even if the Prince is innocent and fair-minded , there 's likely to be those that would use him in a situation like that . " " He does n't sound innocent or fair-minded from the little I 've pried out of anyone , " Talia replied . " Granted in fairness  --  he may just be a naturally cold and hard man . Goddess knows he 's seen enough warfare at his age to have turned him hard . " " Oh ? This is news to me  --  say on . " " At fourteen he participated in a series of campaigns that wiped out every trace of the Northern barbarians along their North Border . That set of campaigns lasted almost two years . At seventeen he led the Army against the last raid Karse ever dared make on them  --  and again , the raiders were utterly wiped out . At twenty he personally mounted a campaign against highwaymen , with the result that nearly every tree from here to the capital was bearing gallows ' fruit that summer . " " Sounds like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead of with fear ? It was apparently the way he conducted himself that has people afraid . He makes no effort to hide the fact that he enjoys killing  --  and he 's utterly , utterly ruthless . He hanged more than a few of those highwaymen ' on merest suspicion of wrongdoing , and lingered with a winecup in his hand to watch while they died . " " Lovely lad . Sounds like just the mate for our Elspeth . " " Do n't even say that as a joke ! " Talia all but hissed . " Or have n't you been granted any of the tales of his conduct with women ? I wasp597told it is n't a good idea to attract his attention , and to stay out of his sight as much as possible . " " Probably more than you ; if you believe what you hear , young Ancar 's taste runs to rape , and the younger , the better , so long as they 're nubile and attractive . But that 's the tale only if you read between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " : They have n't said anything straight out about the wizards he keeps either , : Tantris put in unexpectedly . " What ? " Kris replied in surprise . : I 've been keeping my ears open in the stable . The hostelkeepers have been frightening the stablehands into line with threats about turning them over to Ancar 's wizards if they do n't move briskly and keep to their work. : " So ? That 's an old wives ' trick . " : Not when it 's being used on " stableboys " old enough to have families of their own . And not when the threat genuinely terrified them. : " Lord of Light , this is beginning to look grim  --  " Kris relayed Tantris ' words to Talia . " We 've got to find someone willing to speak out , " she replied . " We dare n't turn back with nothing in our hands but rumors . Selenay needs facts  --  and if we turned back now , we might well precipitate a diplomatic incident . " " I agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if we 're being watched , well  --  we just might not reach the Border again . " " You think it 's possible ? You think he 'd dare ? " " I think he would , if what the rumors hint at is true , and enough was at stake . And the only way we 're going to get any idea of what Ancar is like and what his plans are , is to get in close to him . And I 'm afraid we need that information ; I 'm afraid more than Elspeth 's betrothal hinges on us now . " " That , " she replied , " is what I feared you 'd say . " A day from the capital they finally found someone who would discuss the " rumors . " It was pure luck , plainly and simply . As they rode into town , Talia spotted a trader 's caravan that she thought she recognized . Traders ' wagons were all built to the same pattern , but their gaudy painting was highly individual . The designs rarely included lettering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from literate , but they were meant to be memorable for the selfsamep598reason . And Talia thought she remembered the design of cheerful blue cats chasing each other around the lower border . A few moments later , she saw the shaggy black head of the bearded owner , and could n't believe her good fortune . This trader , one Evan by name , was a man who owed Talia his life . He had beenlil accused of murder ; she had defended him from an angry mob and found out the real culprit . Having cast Truth Spell on him and touched his mind , she knew she could trust not only his words , but that he would not betray them to anyone . His wagon was parked in a row of others , in the stableyard of the " Crown and Candle , " an inn that catered to trade . When they reached the hostel , and settled down to dinner , Talia tapped Kris ' toe with her own . They did n't like to use this method of communicating ; it was awkward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the hostel was nearly empty , and they 'd been given a table to themselves in the back ; she reckoned it was safe enough this time . Follow my lead , she signaled . He nodded , eyes half closed , as if in response to a thought of his own . " I saw an old friend today , " she said  --  and tapped Trader  --  Truth Spell  --  knowing that he would readily remember the only circumstancethat combined those two subjects . " Really ? Wonder if we could get him to stand us a drink ? " And  --  Information source ?  --  he tapped back . " Oh , I think so , " she replied cheerfully . Yes . " Good ! I could stand a drop of good wine . This stuff is not my idea of a drink . " Reliable ? " Then I 'll see if we ca n't talk him into a round or two . " Yes  --  Debt of honor . " Hm . " He pushed his stew around with a bit of bread . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She summoned one of the little boys that hung around the hostel hoping for just such an opportunity to earn a coin , and sent a carefullyworded message to Evan . He replied by the same messenger , asking her to meet him , not at his inn , but at his wagon . He did not seem surprised to see Kris with her . He opened the back of the wagon and invited both of them inside the tiny livingp599area . The three of them squeezed into seats around a tiny scrap of a table , and Evan poured three cups of wine , then waited expectantly . Talia let down her shields with caution , and searched about the wagon for any human presence near enough to hear anything . There was nothing , and no one . " Evan  --  " she said quietly , then , " traders hear a lot . To come straight to the point , I need to know what you 've heard about Prince Ancar . You know you can trust me  --  and I promise we are n't being spied on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated , but only a moment . " I . . . expected something of this sort . If I did not owe you so very much , Lady Herald  --  but t here it is . And you have the right of it , a trader hears much . Aye , there 's rumors , black rumors , about young Ancar . Five , six years agone , when he first came of age and warranted his own court , he began collecting some unchancy sorts about him . Scholars , he calls ' em . And , aye , some good has come of it  --  like the signal towers , some aqueducts and the like . But in the last year his scholars have gotten more of a reputation for wizardry and witchcraft than they have for knowledge . " " Well , now , is n't that what they say of Heralds here , too ? " Kris smiled uneasily . " But I never heard anyone say your witchcraft was anything but of the Light , young man , " Evan replied , " And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's friends are concerned . I 've heard tales that they raise power with the spilling of blood  --  " " How likely ? " Kris asked . Evan shrugged . " Ca n't say . To be fair , I 've been places where the same is said of the followers of the One , and you of Valdemar know how wrong that is . This I can tell for true  --  he has in the past year turned to wenching . Wenching of the nastier sort . He has his way with any poor young maid that catches his eye , highborn or low , and none dare gainsay him  --  and his tastes run to leaving them with scars . Well , and that is n't all . He has men of his own about the countryside these days  --  ' intelligencers ' they call themselves . They claim to be like you twain , being the King 's eyes and ears , to see that all 's well  --  but I misdoubt that they 're speaking their information in any ears but Ancar 's , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like that , " Talia whispered . " I do n't either . I 've been questioned by ' em fair often since I crossed the Border , and I mislike some of the questions they 're ask/ing . Who bought like they 'd gotten prosperous , who 'd told me aught , who bends knee to what god  --  aye , you can believe old Evan the Shrewd became Evan the Stupid ' round ' em . " His expression changed to one of thick-headed opacity . " Aye , milord , no , milord , talk t ' me milord ? " He wiped the look from his face . " Even let ' em cheat me right royally t ' convince ' em . That 's not the end of it . I 've heard from those I trust that Ancar has raised his own private Army ; at least three thousand men , and all of them the scum of the prisons , given their lives on condition they serve him . Well , I 'll likely be gone before I find what this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Ancar takes the throne . Oh , yes , " he shook his head , " I pity them . " They rode away from their hostel the next morning with grim faces , and paused in a little copse of trees just outside of town , where they could see anyone approaching , but no one could see them . " I do n't like it , " Talia said flatly . " My vote is to turn around and head back for the Border  --  but there 's the fact that a move like that could be construed as an insult . " She wanted badly to run ; she was more afraid now than she 'd ever been except when she 'd lost control over her Gift . She was feeling very like she was walking into something she could n't handlenow , too  --  but this was exactly why Selenay had sent them in the first place  --  to uncover anything that might threaten Valdemar . And there was just the faintest of premonitions that some of this might lead back to Orthallen . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied soberly . " We 've heard the rumors ; we need to learn exactly how much danger there is , or we ca n't properly advise the Queen of the situation . We do n't learn the depth of the problem by turning tail and running . And like I said before  --  if we turn now , they might decide we 've learned something , and stop us before we made it back across the Border . If we stick , we should be able to bluff our way out . " " Kris , it 's dangerous ; we 're playing with fire , here . " " I know it 's dangerous , but no more dangerous than any number of other missions Dirk and I pulled off . And we have to find what his long-term plans are , if there 's any chance at all to do so . " " I know , I know , " Talia shivered . " But Kris , I do n't like it . I feel like I 'm walking into a darkened room , knowing that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've walked into a den of serpents and the door 's been locked behind me. "  |p601  " You 're the ranking Herald , little bird . Do we go on and find out exactly what the situation is and whether or not there 's immediate threat to the Kingdom , or do we head back to Selenay with what we know now  --  running like our tails are on fire and hope they ca n't stop us ? " " How could we get back if they come after us ? " Kris sighed . " I would n't give very good odds . What we 'd have to do is cut across country , avoiding roads  --  unfamiliar country , I might add , and we 'd have to go night and day . Or we send Rolan and Tantris back alone , with messages , get rid of our rather conspicuousuniforms , steal disguises , try to get back afoot . With accents that damn us and every intelligences ' in the country knowing our exact descriptions . Frankly , the odds are with playing stupid and bluffing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sick again ? " " Then they 'd expect us to go straight to the capital and the King 's Healers , not head back to our Border . " Talia shut her eyes and weighed all the possible consequences ; then bit her lip , and steeled herself for the decision she knew she had to make . " We go on , " she said , unhappily . " We have n't got a choice . " But when they met their escort just outside the capital at the end of a six-day journey from the Valdemar Border , Talia almost heard the click of the lock behind her . They announced their arrival at the gates of the city , and were asked , courteously enough , to wait . After about an hour , spent watching the usual sort of foot-and-beast traffic pass in and out of the city , there was a blast of trumpets and the common folk vanishedfrom the vicinity as if whisked away by a spell . Talia had expected an official escort ; she had not expected that they would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was exactly what emerged from the city gates . Prancing out of the gateway came a procession of dozens of brightly-bedecked nobles and their liveried attendants , all mounted on high-bred palfreys . Prince Ancar and his entourage rode at the head of it . Talia had definitely not expected him  --  and from the very brief flash of surpriseon his face , neither had Kris . Ancar rode toward them through a double row formed by his mounted courtiers and his guards ; it was all very staged , and meantp602to impress . It impressed Talia , but hardly in the way she assumed he intended . On seeing him for the first time , Talia felt like a cat that has suddenly been confronted by a viper . She wanted to arch her back , hiss , and strike out at him . " Greetings , from myself , and my honored Father , " he said coolly , bowing slightly but not dismounting . " We have come to escort the envoys of Queen Selenay to the palace . " Talia was mortally certain that the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted that his horse was at least two hands higher than either Companion , allowing his head to be that much higher than theirs . Gods  --  I do n't think he 's left anything to chanceThere was no superficial reason for the violent feeling of animositythat struck her ; as they exchanged courtesies the Prince seemed perfectly amiable . He was darkly handsome with smooth , even featuresand a neat black beard and mustache . He spoke to them fairly enough and accorded them every honor . As he rode beside them , back into the city and toward the palace , he discoursed on neutral topics  --  the harvest to come , the recent spring floods that had occurred in both countries , his wish for continuing good relations between the two Kingdoms . All perfectly natural topics , and all spokenin tones of good-will . None of this made the slightest bit of difference to Talia . There was something indefinably evil about the man , something cold and calculating , like a snake judging when it would be best to strike . He was paying very little attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if , because of her sex , she was not quite of an exalted enough station for him to bother with . That was all to the good ; since he was busy directing his attention to Kris , she decided that this was no time for ethical quibbling ; she would try to probe him . This was neither diplomatic nor particularly moral , but she did n't much care . There was something lurking beneath the smooth , careful surface of this cultivated Prince , and she was determined to discover what it was . She was stopped by a powerful shield  --  one unlike anything she had ever touched before . There were no cracks in it that she could discover , not by the most careful probing . Startled , she cast a surreptitiousglance at Ancar ; he continued his conversation without seeming the least disturbed . So he was not the one doing the shielding . Who was ? Then her sharp glance was intercepted by a nondescript man inp603gray riding to the left of the Prince . He looked at her with eyes like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a nod . She shivered , and looked hastily away . They could n't reach the Palace grounds any too soon for Talia , who only wanted out of the Prince 's presence . When they reached the courtyard of the Palace the entire entourage dismounted and dozens of liveried grooms appeared to lead the horses away  --  and with them , their Companions . Shaken by the encounter with the Prince 's mage , Talia scanned the grooms quickly for any evidence of harmful intent . Thank the godsTo her relief there was nothing there but admiration for the beautifulcreatures and the honest wish to make them comfortable . She tried to link with Rolan , and caught an impression of concern , but in the confusion it was hard to make out what the concern was for . Kris began to say something  --  the Prince interrupted him before he 'd even gotten a single syllable out . " The Palace is quite remarkable , " said Ancar , a kind of glint in his eye that Talia did n't understand and did n't at all like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could they do but consent ? And the Prince seemed determined that they see every inch of his father 's Palace , conducting them all over it himself . He kept himself at Kris ' side , and one of his ubiquitous toadies at Talia 's , effectively separating them . They could n't even signal to one another  --  and Talia was nearly stiff with apprehension before the enforced tour was over . Her anxiety , carefully concealed , redoubled every moment they spent in his presence , and she longed for one single momentalone with Kris . It almost seemed as if the Prince were deliberatelyattempting to prevent any contact between the two Heralds that did not take place under his gaze , for he kept them at his side until it was nearly time for the state banquet that was to welcome them . At last they were left alone in their sumptuous suite . Talia scanned about her for listeners , but could detect none . But then  --  could she if they were shielded ? Make discretion the better part , then . " Lord of Light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could ever be so tired . . .  |p604Hand-sign  ; Trap  --  listeners ? She sat down on a couch , and patted the fabric next to her in invitation . He took a seat next to her , and her hand . Squeezed . Gift ? She squeezed back . Shields ? His eyebrows arched in surprise . How ? " Did you see that odd little man on the Prince 's right ? " she asked . Him . " I wonder what on earth he could be . " Shielded Ancar . Maybe more . " Who knows ? Some sort of tutor , maybe . " Trouble . " Hm . I could use a little air . " For true . They moved to the open window , arms around one another , loverlike . " Little bird , " Kris whispered in her ear , " There 's another problem  --  there are n't enough guards visible here . " Talia giggled and nuzzled his neck . " I 'm not sure I understand you , " she murmured back . He laughed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Selenay is well-loved , so she keeps a minimum of guards about her for safety  --  but they 're still there , still visible . Alessandar is just as highly regarded , so I would expect to see about the same number of guards . I did n't see them . If they 're not in sight , they must be out of sight . Why should he hide his guards ? Unless he does n't know that they 're hidden  --  and if you can hide one , you can hide a dozen just as easily . I do n't like it . " " Kris , please  --  " Talia whispered urgently . " I 've changed my mind about staying . I think we should get out of here . Now . To-night . " " I agree ; I think we 've walked into a bit more than we can handle by ourselves . " He led her back to the couch , where they continued the mock-loveplay . " I 've got no doubt now after seeing that magicianand watching the way people react to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So we 'd better leave tonight  --  but not quite yet . I want to find out what 's going on with Alessandar first . " He stayed quiet for a moment , deep in thought , hands resting in the small of her back , and face buried in her hair . " I think we should send substitutesinto the banquet and do some spying before we leave . " " All right , but I 'll do the spying . If I unshield I 'll be able to detect people coming long before you would . " " Could you tell if there 's a shielded spy watching us by the shield on him ? " " Alone  --  no. "  |p605  " I see what you 're getting at . Link  --  " By linking their two Gifts , her Empathy and his Farsight , they were able to scan their entire vicinity for " null " areas . And discovered , to their mutual chagrin , that there were no spies , shielded or otherwise . " Well  --  " he pulled away from her , embarrassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't . " She ran her hands nervously through her hair , and smiled wanly at him . " Better we take the precaution needlessly . If we send in substitutes , wo n't they be recognized ? " " No one from the Prince 's party will be at the banquet , remember ? There wo n't be anyone there who 's ever seen us . And if we use a couple of the servants there should be no problems . After all , no one ever looks at servants . The two they assigned to us should do . They 're enough like us in size and appearance that our uniforms will fit reasonably well . I 'll get their attention , and you deep-trance , and take them over . " Talia shivered . She did n't like doing this , but Kris could n't . His Gift of Farsight would do him no good in implanting a false personality . It was only by virtue of the fact that her Gift of Empathy was a particularly strong one that Talia could do it at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kris rang for the two who had been assigned to them . As he had pointed out , they were similar enough in height and build to the two of them that the uniforms should fit well enough to cause no comment . The servants arrived , and with them , their baggage ; Kris instructedthem in the unpacking of the formal uniforms . While he engaged their attention , Talia put herself into deep-trance . Forgive me  --  she thought , then reached out and touched their minds  --  lightly  --  there  --  first the man , then the womanKris caught them as they fell , easing them down onto the bed . Talia insinuated herself carefully into their minds , sending their real selves into a kind of waking sleep . Now  --  for the next part she would need help:Bolan ? : In a moment he was with her , still anxious , but in agreement with the plan , or at least as much of it as she was able to show him without being able to Mindspeak him in words instead of images . Together they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could do some things she could n't , she couldp606make them believe that they were the foreigners . For the next severalhours the servants would be a sketchy sort of Kris and Talia , and remain that way until they returned to these rooms after the banquet . Their behavior would be rather stilted and wooden , but the formal etiquette such occasions demanded would cover most of that . Talia let Rolan go , and eased herself up out of trance , feeling very stiff , quite exhausted , and just a bit guilty . " Is it  --  " " They 're ready , " she replied , moving her head around to ease the stiffness in her neck , and getting slowly to her feet . " Let 's get some clothes on them . " They clothed the pair in the waiting formal Whites as if they were dealing with two dolls , it being easier to handle them in the entrancedstate . Talia cut their hair in imitation of Kris ' and her own , and applied her skill with makeup to both of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough of a superficial resemblance to the two of them to get them safely through the doors . " All right . " Kris looked at her as they got the two substitutes on their feet . " I 'm for the stables . It 's going to take a little time to find the Companions and their tack without being detected . If I can , I 'll get everything and get them all saddled up . If you have the chance , you meet me at the stable doors . " " Fine , " Talia replied nervously . " I 'm going to sneak up to the second floor and the minstrel 's gallery . I ought to learn something there ; with luck I may be able to pick up something from one of Ancar 's toadies , and I 'll definitely be able to probe Alessandar and find out if he knows what his son is up to . I wo n't take long , if I can help it . " " If the worst happens , and you have to run for it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the run in the courtyard . " Kris gave her a tight grin , and she returned it . Talia took her substitute by the elbow ; Kris did the same with his . Together they led them as far as the doors to the suite ; then Talia released their minds and gave hers a little push . The young woman blinked once , then her implanted personality took over . She took the young man 's arm ; he opened the door , and led her toward the banquet hall . Kris and Talia followed behind them long enough to be certain that the ruse would work , then separated . Thanks to the Prince 's enforced tour they were both familiar with the layout of the entire Palace . Kris made for one of the servants '  |p607stairs  that led to the stables ; once she saw him safely on his way , Talia headed for the gallery that overlooked the banquet hall . She dropped all her shielding and slipped from shadow to shadow along the corridor , taking another of the servants ' stairs to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ; the servants had n't yet had time to light more than a few of the candles meant to illuminate the maze of corridors . She detected no one as she moved to the wall that backed the gallery . She sensed the presence of many men as she paused there , hiding herself in the folds of drapery along the wall . This was very wrong . There were to be no minstrels playing in the gallery until much later this evening ; at the moment they were playing from behind a screen on the floor of the hall . There should be no one at all in the gallery at this time . She closed her eyes and carefully extended her other sense past the wall , hoping that one of them might be nervous enough to let her read what he was seeing , carried on the wind of his emotions . It was easy  --  too easy . The images came charging into her mind  --  she knew who and what they were , and what their intent was , and her heart leapt into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gallery , which ran the entire circumference of the hall , were crossbowmen . Their weapons were loaded and ready , and each had a full quiver of bolts beside him . These were not members of Alessandar 's guard , nor soldiers from his army ; these were ruthless killers recruited personallyby Ancar . The Prince was impatient , and no longer prepared to wait for his father 's natural death to bring him to the seat of power . He was also ambitious , and not content with the prospect of ruling only one kingdom . Here in one room sat his father and everyone who might be opposed to Ancar 's rule , as well as the two Heralds who might have warned their Queen of his intent . The opportunity was far too tempting for him to pass by . Once the banquet was well underway , the doors would be locked  --  and all who might oppose Ancar 's desires would die . With the exception of the Heralds ; Ancar 's orders concerning them were to disable , not kill . And if anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had this whole scheme planned for months , and had only waited for the perfect moment to put it in motion . The sixp608days ' warning he 'd had when they crossed the Border was sufficient for him to mobilize what was already prepared . When the slaughter was over he would ride with his own army to the Border , overwhelm the Queen and her escort as soon as they 'd crossed it , kill her , seize Elspeth , and present himself as Valdemar 's ruler by fait accompli . Talia longed for Kyril 's ability to Farspeak ; even at this distance she would have been able to get some kind of warning back to the Heralds near the Border . And she would have been able to Mindcall Kris , and warn him as well . All she could do was to Mindcall to Rolan , carrying her message on a burst of purest fear , and hope he could convey the whole to Kris through Tantris . She slipped back to the staircase as silently and carefully as she had come , and made her way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighted well , and Talia feared to set foot in it ; feared it doubly when she sensed the presence of more of Ancar 's men standing at intervals along it , presumably to take care of any stragglers . She clung , half paralyzed with terror , to the inside of the door , and tried to think . Was there any other way out ? Then she recalled the smaller rooms of state , meant for receptions and the like , that faced the forecourt on the second floor . Many of them had balconies , and windows or doors that opened out onto the balconies . For the second time she climbed the staircase , heart pounding , her Empathic-sense extended to the utmost . She moved along the wall , between it and the musty draperies lining it , until she came to the door of one of those rooms . Mercifullyit was unoccupied and unlocked ; not even a single candle was lit within . She crept out from behind the drape , ignoring the itch of dust in her eyes and nose , and slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moonlight through the windows , but that was enough to show her a room with a polishedwoodfloor empty of all furniture . She edged around the walls , grudging the time , but not wanting to silhouette herself against those windows for anyone passing by the hall door . The door to the balcony was locked , but from the inside . Talia realized this after an instant of panic-stricken struggle with it . The catch was stiff , but finally gave . She eased the door open and stepped out onto the balcony , crouched low so as to be below the balustrade . A moment 's surveillance of the courtyard showed no eyes to be watching it ; she slipped over the balustrade and was about to drop to the court , when the killing began.  |p609With  her Empathic senses extended as they were , that nearly killed her along with the rest . She felt the deaths of dozens of people in her own flesh ; she lost her grip on the railing and dropped to the cobblestones below . Shock , pain , and fear drove any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save herself . She was falling  --  and could n't think , could n't move , could n't do anything but react  --  react to the agony , the terror  --  and the anguished guilt of Alessandar'sguards seeing him pinned to his throne by dozens of crossbowbolts before they themselves were cut downBut Alberich had foreseen the day when something like this might happen ; he had drilled her until some reactions had become instinctive . Though her mind might be helpless beneath that onslaught , her body wasn'tShe twisted in midair , rolled into a limp ball  --  hit the pavement feet-first , and turned the impact into a tumble that left her sprawled and bruised , but otherwise unharmed . Her face twisted with agony as she struggled to her feet and staggeredtoward the entrance to the stable area , trying to shut her shields down and the pain out . It seemed like an eternity between each stumbling step , yet she had hardly taken half a dozen when she heard the pounding of hooves on stone and saw a white form surging toward her . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he passed her , knowing that she would not be able to mount unless he came to a dead stop . Hard on his heels came Tantris carrying Kris  --  who was leaning over as far as he dared , one hand wrapped in Tantris ' mane , the other extended toward her , his legs clenched so tightly she could almost feel the muscles ache . As Companion and rider passed her , Talia caught him , hands catching forearms , as she leaped and Kris pulled her up in front of him . Tantris had had to slow a trifle , and Rolan was ahead of him , but they 'd not had to stop . But there was one last obstacle to pass  --  the narrow passage between the inner and outer walls that led to the portcullis and the outer gate . And Talia had succeeded in shielding herself once again  --  so they had no warning that the walls were manned . They galloped straight into a hail of arrows . It was over in seconds . Fire lanced through Talia 's shoulder  --  just as Tantris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . She was thrown forward and hit the ground stunned , with the impact breaking off the shaft of the arrow and driving the headp610deeper . But more agonizing than her own pain was what Kris was enduring . Rolan paused in his headlong flight  --  the marksmen had let the unburdened beast go by . There was one thought only in Talia 's mind besides the agony of pain  --  that one of them must escape . " Rolan  --  run ! " she screamed with voice , heart , and mind . He hesitated no longer , but shot through the gate just as the portculliscame crashing down , so close that she felt the sharp pain and his surge of fear as it actually carried away a few hairs from his tail . Kris lay crumpled beside the motionless body of Tantris , so racked with agony that he could not even cry out . She tried to rise , and half-stumbled , half-dragged herself to his side . She took his pain-tortured body into her arms , desperately trying to think of anything that would help him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a straw target  --  but a target that bled ; it had been his body and Tantris ' that had shielded her . Even in the flickering torchlightshe could see that his Whites were dyed in creeping scarlet blotches that spread while she held him . She groped mindlessly for the Healing energy Kerithwyn had used ; not sure what she could do with it , but driven beyond sanity with the overwhelming need to take the burden of his torment from him . She felt a kind of pressure building within her , as it had in those past times when desperation had driven her to pass the bounds of what she knew . It built past the point where she was conscious of anything outside of herself , consciouseven of the agony lancing her own shoulderThen it found sudden release . She opened her eyes to find Kris ' own eyes holding hers ; free from pain and feverishly clear . Although she could feel his pain still , he could not . She had somehow come to stand between it and him . But he was dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , expecting to see soldiers surrounding them . " No . " Kris ' hoarse whisper brought her attention back to him . " They  --  it is a maze . While I live , they will not come . " She understood . His Gift had shown him that there was a maze of stairs and corridors to traverse before the soldiers reached an entrance to this area . But it had also shown him how little time he had left . " Kris  --  " She could n't get anything more past the tears that rose and choked off her words . " No , little love , little bird . Weep for yourself , not for me. "  |p611She  nearly fell to pieces with grief at his words . " I do n't fear Death ; gladly , willingly would I seek the Havens , if I but knew my Companion waits for me there  --  but to leave you  --  how can I leave you with all my burden and yours as well ? " He coughed , and blood showed at the corner of his mouth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek ; she seized it with her own and wept into it . " It is n't fair  --  to leave you alone  --  but warn them , heartsister . Somehow warn them . I can not carry the task to the end , so it ends with you . " She nodded , so choked with tears she could not speak . " Oh , little bird , I love you  --  " He seemed to be trying to say more when another spate of coughing shook him . He looked up again , but plainly did not see her ; his eyes brightened and gladdened as if he were seeing something wonderful and unexpected . " So  --  bright ! For one fleeting moment Talia sensed  --  joy ; joy and the touch of awe and a strange glory that was like nothing she 'd ever sensed before . Then his body shuddered once in her arms , and the light and life left his eyes . He went limp within her embrace  --  and then there was nothing but the empty husk she held . The soldiers came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she was too numb with shock and grief to resist.  |p612HER  GUARDS WERE ANYTHING BUT GENTLE . They bound her hands behind her and kicked and shoved her down countless rock-faced corridors and a flight of rough stone stairs ; when she stumbled they kicked her until she rose , when she faltered they sent her onward with blows . They gave her a final push that sent her sprawling into the center of a bare room . There they put her in the custody of three hulking brutes , creatures who looked more beast than man . These three stripped her to the skin , indifferent to the agony of her shoulder , and brutally searched her . Then one by one , they raped her with the same brutality and indifference . By that time , she was nearly senseless with shock and pain , and it hardly seemed to matter . It was just one more torture . She could n't even concentrate enough to use her Gift to defend herself , and when she 'd tried feebly to fight back , the one using her had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was barely conscious . When they had finished with her they hauled her to her feet by one arm , and threw her into a dirt-floored , stone-walled cell , then tossed what was left of her blood-stained clothing in behind her . It was the cold that finally roused her , cold that chilled her and made her shake uncontrollably , and awoke her lacerated shoulder to new pain . She roused enough then to crawl to where they 'd tossed her things and pull them on over her abused flesh.  |p613Not  surprisingly , nothing had been done about the wound in her shoulder , which continued to bleed sluggishly . I 've  --  got to do something  --  she thought , through the pain and cold clouding her mind ,  --  got to  --  get it out . She got a firmer grip on reality ; thought she remembered that the arrows she 'd seen the guards carrying had had leafpoints . Right  --  She steeled herself against the inevitable , got a good grip on what was left of the slippery , blood-soaked shaft , and pulled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . When her vision cleared , she bound the wound with one hand using a scrap from her shredded shirt as a bandage , and hoped that this would at least stem the blood loss . Selenay . Elspeth . She had to warn the QueenThat goad was driving her past the point where she should have collapsed , and continued to drive her . She had to warn the others . For that she must stay aware  --  and alive , much as she longed to die . She curled in on herself , forcing herself into trance , driving herself regardless of the pain of her brutalized body . With this much pain behind it , even she should be able to reach the Border . But she met with the same wall that had protected the Prince from her probe . She battered herself against it like a wild bird against the bars of a cage , and with as much effect . There were no cracks , no weak points in it . Try as she might , she could not reach her Mindcallpast it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and lay in a hopeless huddle on the floor in the darkness . There was no way of telling how long she lay there before an anomalous sound roused her from a nightmare of shock , pain , and confused grief . She listened again . It was the sound of someone whispering . " Herald ! Lady Herald ! " The voice sounded vaguely familiar . " Herald ! " It was coming from a small opening in the ceiling . She crawled on hands and knees across the dirt floor to lie beneathit , for her legs trembled so much she doubted they 'd hold her , and coughed several times before she could speak . " I 'm  --  here . " " Lady Herald , it 's me , Evan  --  Evan , the trader from Westmark in Valdemar . The one you talked to a day ago . " As she reached out tentatively with her Gift she wondered briefly if this , too , was a trap . Gods  --  if it is  --  but what do I have to lose ? Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gift confirmed that it was the same man . " Oh , gods  --  Evan , Evan , Lady bless you  --  " she gulped and got control over her babbling . " Where are you ? " " Outside the walls in the dry moat . Some of my acquaintances have worked in the Palace and Guard and told me of these ventilationholes . I arrived after you , late this evening  --  I was drinking with some of the Guard when  --  there were screams . They told me some of what was happening , and warned me to hold my tongue if I wanted to live . They are n't bad men , but they are afraid , Herald , very much afraid . The Prince is making no secret now that he has evil magicians , and an entire army that answers only to him . "  --  if only I 'd overruled Kris  --  he 'd be alive now " Later they told me they 'd captured you  --  I  --  could n't leave you without trying to help . I bribed a guard to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he seemed to be groping for words . " Lady , your friend is dead . " " Yes  --  I  --  I know . " She bowed her head as the tears fell anew and she did not try to hold them back . He was silent for a long moment . " Lady , you saved my life ; I am still in your life-debt . Is there some way I can help you ? The Prince means to keep you living ; I am told he has plans for you . " Hope rose to faltering life . " Can you help me escape this place ? " And died . " No , Lady , " he said sadly . " That would require an army . I would gladly try alone  --  but it would not serve you . You would still be here , and I would be quite dead . " Half a dozen ideas flitted through her mind ; one stayed . " Are these holes straight ? Could you lower something to me , or bring something up ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily done . My guide told me that they were quite straight , and unobstructed . " " Can you find me two arrows  --  if you can , see that the barbs of the fletching are heavy  --  and  --  " She faltered , and forced herself to continue. "  --  and at least ten drams of argonel . " " Have they hurt you , Lady ? There are safer ways to ease pain than argonel . And Lady , that much  --  " " Trader , do not argue . I have my reasons , and argonel it must be . Can you do it ? " " Within the hour , Lady . " There was a thin whisper of sound as he left . She propped herself against the wall and tried to use the pain-deadening tricks she'dp615been taught to ease her shoulder and her throbbing loins . She would not let herself hope that the trader would keep his promise , but strove to remain passive , unfeeling , in a kind of numbness . It was still dark when she heard a scratch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all you asked for . It 's coming now . " She pulled herself up the wall and reached for the bundle that dangled from the ceiling with her good hand , feeling more of the injured shoulder muscles tear as she reached up . " The bottle holds fourteen drams , and it is full . " " May the Lord of Lights and the Fair Lady shine on you , friend , and all your kin and trade  --  " she replied fervently , loosening the stopper enough to catch the distinctive sweet-sour odor of argonel . The bottle was completely full . " Leave the string . You will be taking something up in a moment and doing me another service  --  one last office that will free you of life-debt entirely . " " I am yours to command , " he replied with simple sincerity . She snapped the head from the first arrow by holding it under one foot . She let the tears flow freely as she patterned it with Kris ' fletchingpattern , grateful that she 'd been made to learn to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue with the memory fresh of him teaching her his own pattern . The headless arrow  --  code for a Herald dead . Now for the most important half of the message  --  code for herself ; and code for the mission in such ruins that no attempt at rescue should be made . She broke the second arrow in half and patterned the fletching as her own . She tore the remains of one sleeve from her shirt , secured the arrows into a compact bundle with it , and fastened the whole to the string dangling down from the hole in the ceiling . " Trader , pull it up . " It gleamed for a moment against the stone , then was gone . " Now listen carefully . I want you to leave now , before dawn , before the Prince tries to seal the city . You must get outside the city gates . " " There is a guard at the night-gate I know I can bribe . " " Good . Just out of sight of the guardpost on the main highway that runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god of wayfar-ers . " " I know the place . " " My horse will find you there . " The one thing that damned magiciancould n't block was her bond with Rolan ! " Tie the bundle around his neck , just as it is , then take whatever plan seems good top616you . If I were you , I would make a run for the Border ; you 'll be safe enough on the Valdemar side . Know that you have all my thanks and all my blessings . " " Lady  --  a horse ? " She remembered then that he was Hardornen , and could n't know how unlike horses the Companions were . " He is more than horse ; think of him as a familiar spirit . He will return to my people with my message . Will you do this for me ? " He was close to weeping himself . " Is there nothing more I can do ? " " If you do that , you will have done more than I dared hope . You take with you all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and quickly . " He did not speak again , and she heard the scrape that signaled his departure . She felt for her contact with Rolan . Her bond with him was at too deep a level for the magician even to sense , let alone block . Althoughalternating waves of pain and faintness threatened to overwhelmher , she managed to remain aware until she knew with total certainty that Rolan had gotten her message-bundle from the trader . Rolan did not need any instructions to know what to do . Her contact with him weakened and faded as she weakened with effort and blood loss and he headed for the Border at his fastest pace , until it vanished altogether as he reached the edge of her fast-shrinking range . By then it was almost dawn . Now , there were just two more tasks , and she would be able to give way to her anguish , her hurts , her grief . First , the bottle . The trader had been right to be nervous about argonel . It was chancy stuff . Sometimes even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used it now and again to end the suffering of one they could not save . It had the advantage that no matter how great the overdose , there were no painful side effects such as there were with other such drugs  --  nothing but a peaceful drifting into sleep . If four drams could kill , fourteen should make death very sure . Using the broken-off arrowhead , she scraped a hole in the floor beneath the pile of molding straw that was supposed to be her bed , a hole just deep enough to bury the bottle . Alessandar had not been the kind of monarch that often used his dungeons ; by the grace of the gods the floors were packed earth rather than stone , with a pit dug in one corner for a privy.  |p617She  would not use the drug yet  --  not until she was certain that the Queen had received the warning . Soon , Bright Lady  --  make it soonThen she scraped a second hole , and a third , and hid the arrowheadfrom the broken arrow and the one she 'd pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should find the bottle , she could still cut her wrists with one of them . Her shoulder was aflame with pain and bleeding again , and a little gray light was creeping down the ventilation hole when she 'd finished . She lay on the straw and let herself mourn at last . Tears of sorrow and of pain were still pouring from her eyes when blood loss and exhaustion finally drove her into unconsciousness . When she came to herself again , there was a single spot of sunlighton the floor , making the rest of the room seem black by comparison . She blinked in hurt and confusion , as the door clanked once and opened . She saw one of her jailors strolling toward her , wearing a sadistic grin and unfastening his breeches as he walked . For the space of a second she was ready to cry out and shrink away from him  --  but then a cold and deadly anger came over her , and abruptly she could bear no more . She took all her agony and Kris ' ( still rawly part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred , and hurled them into his unprotectedmind in a blinding instant of forced rapport . Hatred could n't sustain her long  --  she could n't maintain it for more than a single moment  --  but that moment was enough . He screamed soundlessly , and flung himself wildly at the door , nearly knocking himself senseless when he reached it . He slammed it after himself , and threw the bolt home . She could hear him babblingin panic to his comrades on the other side . As she slumped back , she knew that they would not dare to molest her again , not unless the magician was with them . That was very unlikely . That one was too busy protecting his Prince and keeping her from Mindspeakingto have time to spare to protect menials so that they might amuse themselves . They shoved in a pail of water and a plate of some sort of slop later in the day . She ignored the food , but drank the stale , fustytastingwater avidly . Her terrible thirst woke her to the fact that she was beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin next to the arrow-wound . It was hot and dry to the touch , and badly swollen.  |p618She  was taking wound-fever . While she was still able , she relieved herself down the privy hole in the corner , telling herself that she should be grateful that there was nothing in her stomach and bowels to make a flux of . It was cold comfort , that . She pulled the bucket within reach of the straw and propped herself against the wall in case someone should try to take her unaware . When the hallucinations and fever-dreams began , she was more or less ready for them . There was no pattern to the fever . When she was able to think , she would tend to herself as best she could . When the fever took her , she endured . There were horrible visions of the slaughter in the banquet hall , and the victims paraded their death-wounds before her and mutely asked why she had n't warned them . In vain she told them that she had n't known  --  they pressed in on her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smothering herHer bestial guards multiplied into a horde , and used her , and used her , and used herThen Kris came . At first she thought it was going to be another dream like the first , but it was n't . Instead , he was whole , well ; even happy  --  until he saw her . Then , to her distress , he began weeping  --  and blamed himself for what had happened to her . She tried to put on a brave face for him , but when she moved , she hurt so much that her fragile pretense shattered . He shook off his own distress at that , and hurried to kneel at her side . He somehow drove away some of the pain , spoke words of comfort , bathed her feverish brow with cool water . When she whimperedinvoluntarily as movement sent lances of hurt through her shoulder , he wept again with vexation at his own impotence , and berated himself for leaving her alone . When the other , horrible dreams came , he stood them off . The next time she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrap torn from her sleeve near the bucket , still damp . After trying to puzzle it out , she decided that she 'd done it herself , and the dream had been a rationalization of it . As delirium began to take her again , she tried to tell herself that it was unlikely that her hallucinations would include Kris a second time . But they did , and Kris continued to guard her from the hideous visions , all the while trying to give her courage.  |p619Finally  she gave up even trying to pretend to hope , and told Kris about the argonel . " No , little bird , " he said , shaking his head at her . " It is n't your time yet . " " But  --  " " Trust me . Trust me , dearheart . Everything is going to come out fine . Just try to hold on  --  " He faded into the stone , then , as she woke once more . That puzzled her . Why should a fever-dream of her own making be trying to urge her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most part , she simply suffered , and endured the waiting , watching for some sign that her message had safely reached Selenay . The Queen and her entourage should have reached the Border about two days after she and Kris had ridden through the palace gates . They would have been expecting Kris about three or four days after they arrived  --  a week after she 'd been thrown in here . With luck and the Lady with him , Rolan should reach them about that time . She added the days in her head  --  that meant he would reach the Queen in six to ten days at his hardest gallop  --  six if he could take the open roads , ten if he had to backtrack and hide . When Hulda first appeared , at the end of the third day , Talia thought initially that she was another hallucination . If it had n't been that Hulda 's sharp features and strange grayvioleteyes were unmistakable , Talia would n't have recognized her . She was swathed in a voluptuous gown of burgundy-wine velvet , cut low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her neck and hands and the net that bound her hair . But most amazing of all , she appeared to be hardly older than Talia herself . She stood peering into the darkness , eyes darting this way and that ; a cruel smile touched her lips when she finally spotted Talia huddled against the wall . She moved from the center of the room with an odd , gliding step to stand above Talia , eyes narrowed in pleasure , and nudged her sharply with one dainty shoe . The pain she caused made Talia gasp and pull in on herself  --  and her heart leapt into her throat when she realized that the woman was still standing there  --  real , and no hallucination . When Talia 's eyes widened with shock and recognition , Hulda smiled . " You remember me ? How very touching ! I had no hope you 'd have any recollection of little Elspeth 's adored nurse . " She moved a few steps farther away and stood artfully posing inp620the light that came through the ventilation hole . " And how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been pleased to see me brought so low , would n't you ? But I am not caught so easily , little Herald . Not half so easily . " " What  --  what are you ? " The words were forced out almost against Talia 's will . " I ? Besides a nurse , you mean ? " She laughed . " Well , a magician , I suppose you 'd call me . Did you think the Heralds held all the magic there was in the world ? Oh , no , little Herald , that is far , far from being the case . " She laughed again , and swept out of the cell , the door clanging shut behind her . Talia struggled to think ; but  --  Lord and Lady , this meant there was more , much more at stake here than she 'd dreamed . Hulda  --  so young-looking , and claiming to be a magician . And she had n't any trace of a Gift , Talia knew that for certain . Put that together with the mage who guarded Ancar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! That meant that old magic , real magic , and not just Heraldic Mind-magic , was loose in the world again . And in the hands of Valdemar 's enemiesAnd Hulda had been  --  must have been  --  playing a deeper game than anyone ever guessed , and for far longer . But to what purpose ? Hulda came again , this time after dark , bringing some kind of witchlightwith her . It was an odd , misty ball that gave off a red glare that flickered and pulsated ; it floated in behind her and hovered just above her shoulder , bathing the entire cell in an eerie , reddish glow . This time Talia was more or less ready for her . She was free from delirium for the moment , and feeling light- yet clear-headed . She had managed to put her own emotions and the helplessness of her position in the back of her mind , hoping for some stroke of luck that might bring her a chance to strike back at her tormentors . She had figured that Hulda was warded , even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her guess was correct . So rather than making any other moves , she simply shifted her weight where she sat so that she might be able to get to her feet at a moment 's notice . Hulda smiled mockingly ; Talia glared right back . " You might rise to greet me , " she mocked . " No ? Well , I sha n't ask it of you . You 'll be dancing to my little Prince 's tunes soon enough.  |p621Or  should I say , King ' ? I suppose I should . Are n't you at all curious as to why and how I came here ? " " I have the feeling you 'd tell me whether I cared or not , " Talia said bitterly . " Spirited ! You 're right , I would . Oh , I spent years looking for a child like Ancar  --  one of high estate , yet one who could readily incline himself to what I would teach him . Then once I found him , I knew within a year that one land would never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he could do without me for a time , I turned my attention toward finding him a suitable mate . Dear Elspethseemed so perfect  --  " she sighed theatrically . " Oh ? " " You are so talented , little Herald ! What volumes of meaning you convey with a single syllable ! Yes , dear Elspeth seemed perfect  --  coming from a long line of those Gifted magically , and with such a father ! Plotting against his own wife ! Delicious ! " " If you 're trying to convince me that treachery is inherited , you 're wasting your breath . " She laughed . " Very well then , I 'll be brief . I intended Elspeth to be properly trained and eventually consolidate an alliance with Ancar . As you probably guessed , I substituted myself for the original Hulda . Things were progressing quite well  --  until you intervened . " This time the glance she shot at Talia was venomous . " FortunatelyI was forewarned . I returned to my dear Prince , and when he was of an age to begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together a quite tidy plot . " She began pacing the room , restlessly , the folds of her vermilion gown collecting loose dirt from the floor , dirt which she ignored . " What is it , " Talia asked the ceiling above her head , " what is it about would-be tyrants that makes them speak and posture like third-rate gleemen in a badly-written play ? " Hulda pivoted sharply about and glared , her hands twitching a little as if she 'd like to settle them about Talia 's neck . Talia braced herself , hoping she 'd try . Granted , she was as weak as water , but there were some tricks Alberich had taught her . . . . " Have n't you got anything better to do than boast about your petty triumphs to a captive audience ? " she taunted . Hulda 's face darkened with anger ; then to Talia 's disappointment she regained control of herself , and slowly straightened andsmoothed the folds of her gown while she calmed her temper . " You 're to be a part of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ancarp622wanted both of you alive , but you alone will do . We 'll all ride togetherto the Border and wait for your Queen there . She 'll see you with us , and be reassured . Then  --  " " You do n't seriously think you 'll get me to cooperate , do you ? " " You wo n't have a choice . Just as my Prince 's servant can keep you from sending your little messages , so I can take control of your own body from you  --  particularly since you 're in rather poor conditionat the moment . " " You can try . " " Oh , no , little Herald . I can bring in more help than you could ever hope to hold against . I will succeed . " She laughed , and swept out the door , then , the witchlight following . As Talia had hoped , on the tenth day of her captivity , the door to her cell opened , and Prince Ancar and his magician stood before her . And with him was Hulda . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delirium . She debated facing them standing , but decided that she did n't have the strength . She simply stared at them with undisguised contempt . " My messengers have sent signals telling me that the Queen of Valdemar has turned back at the Border , " Ancar said , gazing at her with basilisk-eyes . " And now they say she gathers an army to her side . Somehow you warned her , Herald . How ? " She returned him stare for stare . " If you two are so all-powerful , " she asked contemptuously , " why do n't you read my thoughts ? " His face reddened with anger . " Damn you Heralds and your barriers  --  " he spat , before Hulda managed to hush him . Talia stared at him in astonishment . Brightest Lady  --  he ca n't read me  --  they ca n't read me , ca n't read Heralds  --  no wonder we almost caught Hulda before  --  For one moment , she felt a stirring of excitement , but it faded . The information was priceless  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pluck truth from her thoughts , and so would never know when and if she lied . So start now . Tell them a truth they would never believe . Accordingto Elspeth , Hulda had never believed that the Companions were more than very well trained beasts . She had been convinced it was the Heralds who picked the Chosen , not the Companions . So . " My horse , " she said after a long pause , " My horse escaped to warn them . "  |p623Ancar  smiled , and ice rimed her blood . " An imagination , I trow . You should have been a Bard . This will only delay things , you must realize . I have been working toward my goals for years , and I can easily compass a little more delay . " He turned toward Hulda , and brushed his lips along her hair . " Ca n't I , my dear nurse ? " " Easily , my Prince . You have been a most apt pupil . " " And the pupil has exceeded the teacher , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not in all . " " Perhaps you will be interested to hear that I know of your quarrel with the young Heir , little Herald . It would seem that she is quite crestfallen , and determined to make it up with you , since my informanttells me she is most eager to be meeting with you again . A pity that wo n't happen . It would have been amusing to watch the meeting  --  andyou under my dear nurse 's control . " Talia tried not to show any reaction , but her concentration slipped enough that she bit her lip . " Do tell her who our informant is , my love , " Hulda murmured in Ancar 's ear . " None other than the trusted Lord Orthallen . What , you are not surprised ? How vexing . Hulda discovered him , you know  --  found that he had been working at undermining the Heralds and the Monarchs so long and so cleverly that no one even guessed how often he 'd played his cards . " " Some of us guessed . " " Really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But have you guessed why ? Ancar has promised him the throne . Orthallen has wanted that for so very long , you see . He thought he had it when he arranged for an assassin to take Selenay 's father in battle . But then there was Selenay  --  and all those Heralds who persisted in protectingher . He decided to do away with them first  --  it 's a pity how little luck he 's had . He has been so surprised at the way you keep eluding his traps . He 'll be even more amazed when Ancar gives him the dagger instead of the crown . But I am disappointed that you had guessed at his perfidy already . " " My poor dear  --  two disappointments in one day . " Ancar turned his cold gaze back on Talia . " Well , since you have denied me one pleasure , you can hardly blame anyone but yourself when I use you for another , can you ? Perhaps it will make up for the entertainments your actions denied my dear nurse . "  |p624  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant must not let the barrier break for even a moment . " He smiled again . " Small chance of that , my love . He knows the penalty should he fail to keep her trapped within her own mind . Should he weaken , my heart  --  he becomes yours . " She trilled with delight as he signaled to the hulking guards that stood behind him . They seized Talia and dragged her to her feet , pinioning her arms behind her back . Anguish threaded her body as the wound broke open anew , but she bit her lip and suffered silently . " Stubborn as well ! How entertaining you will be , Herald . How very entertaining . " He turned and led the way from the cell with the magician and Hulda in close attendance and the guards following with Talia . There was a long corridor that smelled of mold and damp , and an iron door at the end of it . Beyond it was the smell of fear , and blood . They shackled her arms to the cold stone above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded shoulder . " I consider myself an artist , " Ancar told her , " There is a certain artistry in producing the most pain without inflicting permanent damage , or causing death . " He removed a long , slender iron rod from the fire and regarded the white-hot tip thoughtfully . " There are such fascinating things to be done with this , for instance . " As from a century distant she recalled Alberich discussing some of the more unpleasant realities of becoming a Herald with a small knot of final-year students in which she was included . " The possibility of torture , " Alberich had said on that long ago afternoon , " is something we can not afford to ignore . No matter what it is that the stories say , anyone can be broken by pain . There are mental exercises that will enable one to escape , but they are not proof against the worst that man can devise . All I can advise you if you find yourself in the hopeless situation is that you must lie ; lie so often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth when they hear it . For the time will come when you will tell them the truth  --  you will be unable to help yourself . But by then , I hope , you will have muddied the waters past any hope of clarity . . . . But Ancar did not want information ; he was getting that in plenty from Orthallen . All he wanted was to make her hurt . She was damned if she 'd give him satisfaction before she had to.  |p625So  the " fascinating things " failed to drive a sound from her , and the Prince was displeased . He proceeded to more sophisticated tortures , involving complicatedapparatus . He handled all of this himself , his long hands caressingthe bloodstained straps and cruel metal as he described in loving detail what each was to do to her helpless body . Talia did her best to keep herself shielded , and to retreat behind those mental barriers to pain and the outside world she had long ago learned to erect , but as he continued his entertainment , her barriers and shielding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , Hulda , and the nameless magician were experiencing . The intensely sexual pleasure he derived from her pain was worse than rape ; and she was in too much agony to block it out . Hulda 's pleasure was as perverted , and as hard to bear . In fact , both of them were erotically aroused to a fever-pitch by what they were doing to her , and were a scant step from tearing the clothing from each other 's backs and consummating their passion there and then . Twice she tried to turn her agony back on him , but the magician always shielded him . The magician was deriving nearly as much enjoyment from this as Ancar and his " dear nurse " were , and Talia wished passionately ( while she was still thinking coherently enough to wish ) to be able to strike out at all of them . After a time , she was no longer capable of anything but screaming . When they crushed her feet , she was not even capable of that . They dragged her back to her cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not derive half the pleasure from her torture when she could not respond to his experiments . He stood over her , gloating , as she lay unable to move on the straw where they 'd left her . " So , child , you must rest , and recover , so that we can play my games again , " he crooned . " Perhaps I will tire of the game soon ; perhaps not . No matter . Think on tomorrow  --  and think on this . When I tire of you , I shall still find a use for you . First my men will again take their pleasure of you , for they shall not mind that you are no longer as attractive as you once were ; some of them would find your appearance as stimulating as I do , my dear . Then you shall be my messenger . How will your beloved Queen react to receiving her favorite Herald , but a small piece at a time ? " He laughed , and swept out with Hulda at his side , already fondlingone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It took every last bit of her will , but she remained where she
