ADEL , Iowa  --  The Republican presidential race is becoming increasingly a two-man race , with the struggle between Vice President George Bush and Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas taking on an increasingly bitter tone . The two men , building on the acrimony of the Des Moines Register GOP debate Friday , are moving into a new phase of the campaign , exchanging angry barbs , charges and counter-charges . In the debate and in a visit here in central Iowa  --  birthplace of movie legend John Wayne and home of storied Iowa football hero Nile Kinnick  --  Mr. Bush assumed a tough , new style . He criticized the state ' s major newspaper , asserting he isn ' t camouflaging his role in the Iran-Contra affair , and blasted Sen. Dole . " I suggest he take a little time off from the campaign and read " the documents provided to the congressional committee that investigated the affair , said Mr. Bush , whose offensive failed to quell the questions about his part in the affair . Mr. Dole , meanwhile , called on Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accused Mr. Bush of blaming the press for his political difficulties . " Why doesn ' t he release what we want to know about Iran-Contra ? " Mr. Dole snapped shortly before leaving the state this weekend . Mr. Bush is expected to be questioned under oath today by prosecutors in the office of the independent counsel investigating the Iran-Contra affair . With the Iowa caucuses only four weeks from tonight , the two principal contenders signaled that each will press on with strategies designed to embarrass the other . Though he didn ' t push the vice president on the issue during the debate , Mr. Dole plainly sees political advantage in the Iran-Contra question . Yesterday , on the ABC program " This Week , " he suggested that Mr. Bush ask President Reagan to release new documents on the affair . " Confidentiality is to protect the president , not the vice president , " he said . It is clear that the Bush camp in the week ahead will seek to divert attention from the Iran question . " I don ' t think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " acknowledged Rich Bond , the chief Bush aide here in Iowa . The Bush strategy  --  he called on Republican candidates to release their tax returns for the past decade  --  is designed to highlight Mr. Bush ' s integrity and to discredit claims by Mr. Dole , who leads in most polls here , that he is a modest Midwesterner without great wealth . In the debate , Mr. Dole portrayed himself as " this guy from Kansas who came from a poor background and made it the hard way . " But the Bush campaign hopes the disclosure gambit will show Mr. Dole to be wealthier than most small-town Kansans , and over the weekend the Bush camp distributed news reports suggesting financial impropriety involving a former Dole aide and a blind trust owned by Mr. Dole ' s wife , former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole . On the ABC program yesterday , Mr. Dole suggested he would " in due time " be willing to release his income tax statements , said there was nothing untoward about the blind trust , and criticized the Bush campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weekend impounded petitions filed in Texas by Mr. Dole , former Gov . Pierre du Pont of Delaware and former Secretary of State Alexander Haig , after state party officials asked federal authorities to investigate whether some signatures were forged . The questionable signatures could jeopardize the candidates ' attempts to be placed on the ballot for the March 8 primary . Sen. Dole ' s spot may be safe ; he submitted 8 , 100 signatures , well above the 5 , 000 required , and more than enough , his staff says , to compensate for any fraudulent signatures . The two other candidates have narrower margins . Mr. Dole has blamed the potential problem on a private consulting firm that has worked for all three campaigns . In the two-hour debate Friday , which was telecast throughout this state , the GOP candidates broke little new ground . But the forum allowed the others to position themselves for the final burst of trench warfare that may pare down the field before the New Hampshire primary eight days after the caucuses . Mr. du Pont criticized the arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate , arguing , " I don ' t believe the Communists have suddenly become non-Communists . " Rep. Jack Kemp of New York assailed Mr. Dole , principally for his advocacy of an oil-import fee . And former television evangelist Pat Robertson , in an effort to woo anti-tax conservatives from the Kemp camp , noted that the Buffalo-area lawmaker has supported increases in the Social Security tax . Through the past week , Mr. Bush has emphasized that , like the president , he was unaware of the details of the Iran-Contra operation . " I ' ve answered every question put to me save one : ' What did you tell the president ? ' " he said . Ronald Reagan helped swing the 1980 New Hampshire primary away from Mr. Bush when he grabbed the microphone in a Nashua , N.H. , hall and , before reporters and a large local audience , took control of a debate . The vice president gambled Friday that a dramatic gesture might help him show strength and resolve . Mr. Bush criticized Des Moines Register editor James Gannon for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t said whether he was aware of the diversion of profits from the Iran arms sale to the Contras . " You , your paper today had that question raised as if I hadn ' t answered it , " Mr. Bush said to Mr. Gannon . " And I resent it , frankly , and I think you owe me now , you owe it to me to ask the question I haven ' t answered . " The challenge won Mr. Bush a stream of television newsclips in the state and a stern color photograph of himself  --  one finger extended , pointing forcefully as he made his point  --  across half the width of the Saturday morning Register . And it had the unintended consequence of drawing Mr. Dole into the sort of quip  --  just this side of mean  --  that his advisers had hoped to avoid . He described Mr. Bush ' s criticism of the Register as " the ghost of Spiro Agnew coming into Iowa and taking it out on the press . " " Is that the old Bob Dole ? " rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wouldn ' t answer , but Barbara Bush , standing at the side of the Adel-DeSoto High School gymnasium , nodded her head with gusto . " I didn ' t speak , " she said , " but you heard it . " But Mr. Dole wasn ' t the only Bush tormentor . During the debate , Mr. Haig asked Mr. Bush why he said he was thinking about the separation between church and state as he awaited rescue after his plane was shot down during World War II . The vice president testily and flatly denied he had ever said such a thing . But in a speech at the Old Creamery Theater in Garrison , Iowa , on Dec. 5 , Mr. Bush told that story , when he cited his war service as part of the experience he would bring to the presidency . " I was shot down , " he said , " and I was floating around in a little yellow raft setting a record for paddling . I thought of my family , my mom and dad , and the strength I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the separation of church and state . That was my motivation .
