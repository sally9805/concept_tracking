Brokers brace for a flood of trading in the new A T &; T stocks <P> One of the axioms of geometry is that the whole is equal to the sum of its parts . Sometimes , though , the parts can add up to more than the whole . To the delight of Wall Street , that is what seemed to be happening last week with American Telephone &; Telegraph . <P> As part of the breakup of the phone company , which will take place Jan. 1 , A T &; T last week filed 53,000 documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission . The papers projected 1984 sales , profits and dividends for the eight companies that will come into existence when the familiar Ma Bell is split up . The first quarterly dividend next year for all eight firms is expected to total $1.365 per current share of A T &; T stock . That is 1 more per share than the old A T &; T has been paying for the past three years . Said Robert Allen , chief financial officer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the whole . " <P> After the figures were announced , the price of A T &; T stock rose by 1 ? to 63 ? , on a one-day trading volume of 2.2 million shares , one of the heaviest ever for any single stock . It was a sizable movement for A T &; T , which rarely goes up or down by so much in one trading session . <P> With 3.2 million shareholders , 2 million of them holding fewer than 100 shares , A T &; T is the most widely owned stock in the world . But the mood concerning A T &; T among both market experts and amateurs has been jittery . Said Robert Rubin , a partner and trader at Wall Street 's Goldman Sachs : " Most institutions are just as confused as individual shareholders . " Early last week , A T &; T fell by more than a dollar in a single day on the basis of one analyst 's speculation that the phone company 's dividend might go down for the first time . <P> The documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , provided the first detailed look at how A T &; T thinks the eight new companies will fare after the New Year 's Day breakup . The most carefully studied report was a 267-page information statement and prospectus that will be sent to every A T &; T shareholder during the next few weeks ; printing and distributing that document alone cost $3.9 million . In the study , A T &; T projected that its new slimmed-down company , which includes long-distance service , Western Electric and the Bell Laboratories , would show revenues of $56.5 billion for 1984 , only about $11.1 billion behind the sales of the old , combined company . It anticipates more than $34 billion in long-distance revenues and at least $15 billion in sales of Western Electric 's telephone equipment . The remaining $7.5 billion is expected to come from sales of such products as computers and office information systems .
