Standing with my back to Il Rendetore , one of two major Palladian churches anchored on the Adriatic waters , I watched its classical facade shimmer on the surface before me . Istrian stone floating on water ; its image doubling and dissolving with each boat wake . The entire trip would have this edge , this play of surfaces , about it. // In this distance , I heard the low-geared sputter of a vaporetto reversing its engines . Its next stop was the quay on which I stood waiting . As the boat lunged toward me I shot a final look at Il Rendetore . And , once aboard , a final look at Venice itself : at its light charging and silhouetting the city with quicksilver. // It wasn ' t Venice or the Palladian churches that crown it that I had come to see . The journey , no less serpentine than the waterways I would soon follow , was inland , in the Veneto , the province north of Venice . For a week I would traverse its terraced landscape : the low-lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the object of my search : the famous Palladian villas , those magnificent monuments to Venetian aristocratic life and , more specifically , to the genius of their creator , Andrea palladio. // From Venice one travels an hour by car to Vicenza , a city centered at the heart of " the garden of Venice , " the rich agricultural area perimetered by Verona , Padova , and Treviso . It is here that the 16th-century Venetian nobility , shifting its commerce from sea to agriculture , committed its fortunes to land , thus erecting villas tailored to the needs of the gentleman farmer . While reflecting the aristocratic status of its owner , the villa served its practical considerations of husbandry and harvests first . The classical architectural format , therefore , was a central living block , often preceded by a pedimented portico modeled on a Roman temple , from which low-flanking wings , designed for farm storage , extended. // Of the 3 , 000 villas that once dotted the Veneto , 294 remain , 20 of which were designed by Palladio . While in various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still provide us with one of the most interesting journeys within Italy . While showcasing 16th-century life , in particular the splendors of Venetian art , the villas illuminate the purity of Palladio ' s style , the harmony of line and elegance of form that hallmark his work . To see his villas , the very crystallization of his influence , is to understand why he is the most imitated architect in history. // From these classical villas sprang the architectural phenomenon known as Palladianism . Cutting across cultures , fanning from Italy to England to America to Russia , Palladianism inspired Jefferson ' s Monticello and Lord Burlington ' s Chiswick House to cite but two famous examples . Supplemented by " I Quattro Libri dell ' Architettura , " his seminal treatise published in 1570 , palladio ' s innovations  --  the elegant facades symmetrically arranged around a central columnar portico  --  soon echoed off every church , college , and civic building in the Western world. // The pervasiveness of Palladio ' s influence ruled into symmetry by centuries of farming , are all consciously played upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A villa , " Palladio once wrote , " is nothing other than a small city . " Indeed , the classic Palladian villa : a linear or horseshoe configuration joined at the spine by a stately pavillion , connects all levels and means of rural life . Mannersly salons coexist with granaries and dovecotes . The stress is elegant functionalism . This formal simplicity is further underlined by the building ' s materials . Built of rough brick , the walls were then stuccoed and painted white . Thus , at little expense , one achieved an effect of sublime uniformity. // The overall impression one receives from Palladio ' s work is its sense of order , the harmonic relation of its parts to the whole . Both inside and out , the geometry of a villa is a fascinating system of communication . Inside , the axial alignment of doors tunnels perspective forward . One ' s eye shoots immediately from door to corridor to salon to window . The window , in turn , framed at the opposite end of the villa , opens out onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone , garden , water , field , refers the eye further. // Palladio ' s villas are designed to challenge the eye , to test its powers of visual connection . Why the journey is particularly intriguing , therefore , is that it involves one in an ongoing perspective game . Since no two villas are alike , each time one must see afresh . Certainly the three most challenging villas , with the exception of Malcontenta which rests further south , are the Villa Emo at Fanzolo , the Villa Barbaro at Maser , and the Villa Rotunda just outside Vicenza. // If based in Vicenza , one can easily reach these villas by an hour ' s car ride . Paralleling the waterways that snake through the Veneto , the traveler winds his way trhough a countryside quilted with crops . If you travel in late September , as I did , the dark shine of grapes , bright with the promise of early harvest , deepens the landscape with color . Everything owes much to the fact that he was , above all , a practical working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was transformed into an incipient architect and humanist scholar by his mentor , Count Giangiorgio Trissino . Under the latter ' s patronage , in 1541 Palladio made the first of several trips to Rome . There , walking amid the ruins of Greco-Roman civilization , he absorbed the lessons of antiquity while simultaneously observing those of his contemporaries , Bramante and Michelangelo. // What Palladio succeeded in doing , and what his villas so brilliantly demonstrate , was to transform these influences into a highly personal architectural vocabulary perfectly suited to the practical and aesthetic needs of his time . Combining the gravity of Rome with the sunny openness of northern Italy , Palladio creaed a series of villas between 1550-1570 that are unique in Renaissance architecture . Of increasing complexity and purity , each villa represents an elegant and unexpected solution to the demands of its natural environment. // While the settings differ considerably  --  some nestled amid sloping hills , others on flat , fallow planes  --  each villa relates to its space in such a way that man , the center of this microcosm , is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus the waterways , the orchards , the fields is possessed of a leisurely beauty. // Every day , for a week , I woke in keen anticipation of this drive and what I knew waited at its end . We have all made the trip in our dreams . Now I was making it in person . For there is something surreal about these villas . To visit them is to conclude that Palladio , not Freud , furnished the imagery of our dreams . The scene is always the same : One is walking down a long path at the end of which is a villa of elegant simplicity . The gravel crunching under one ' s feet shatters the glassy silence . The air is sharp with the smell of lemon and verbena . The scene has about it the strangely compelling logic of dreams ; the surreal edge found in Atget ' s photos or Brunel ' s films. // Fortunately , the scene and the villas themselves are very real indeed . Perhaps the most beautiful is the Villa Barbaro at Maser . Built in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a noted humanist scholar , the villa is the most richly decorated of all the villas . Rising halfway up an incline , poised between the hills behind it and the planes sheeting in front , the Villa Barbaro epitomizes the world of the gentleman farmer. // However commanding its setting , the villa ' s real attraction is its interiors , in particular the cycle of frescoes done by Veronese at the height of his career . Complimenting Palladio ' s subtle modulation of volume by light , Veronese ' s frescoes rhythmically fill space with color . Of particular note are the **28;6363; trompe l ' oeil <> portraits winking from the walls : family members peering down from a painted balcony rimming the ceiling ; a dog tucked into a corner ; a window that is really a wall. // By contrast , the interior of the Villa Emo at Fanzolo imposes an ideal of frankness , a quality of stoical simplicity that is characteristic of the villa as a whole . Built in 1565 for Leonardo Emo , the villa eschews all ornamentation , relying instead on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect . White Zolotti frescoes fill some rooms with high Venetian color , it is the symmetry and size of the rooms themselves that catch the eye. // Here , as at the Villa Barbaro , the eye is forever drawn to the window , to the cascade of lawn and field outside . Situated on a plane , the Villa Emo relies on the vertical accent of poplar trees , which extend in long colonnades , to counterpoint an otherwise unrelieved flat stretch of land. // Of all Palladio ' s villas , the Villa Rotunda outside Vicenza is the most breathtaking example of landscaped architecture . Resting on a knoll , the villa commands a 360-degree arc , its symmetrical porticos pointing toward the cardinal compass points . The most supremely elegant of villas , it is easy to see why critics have called the domed work " a beacon. " // Built in 1570 , the Villa Rotunda was one of the only villas not intended as a farm . This accounts , in part , for its patrician ethos ; its classical authority . Upon seeing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , achieved a greater degree of luxury . " And later , on Palladio himself , Goethe added , " a great man who does not wish to conform to the world , but to transform it in accordance with his own high ideals. " // Nowhere is this more evident than in the town of Vicenza itself . Here Palladio set out to model a city on the humanist doctrines of his time . Vicenza in general , and Palladio ' s Theatro Olympico in particular , were designed as perspective boxes to illustrate the laws of classical humanism . To walk the city , the city Palladio conceived of as a scaled Rome , is to observe doctrine in stone . The city is a lesson in how we see and relate to the world around us. // The Theatro Olympico , built in 1580 to house the august Academy , is Palladio ' s most obvious attempt at instruction . Although the theater was completed by his protege , Scamozzi , nonetheless it clearly shows Palladio ' s original intention : to re-create the antique world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proscenium , with arched central openings , re-creates the streets of Thebes . In this final work Palladio paid hommage to the classical world , to the laws and the lessons that continue through his work and our pilgrimages to it. // //
