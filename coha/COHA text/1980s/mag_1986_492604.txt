Mr. McHugh woke with a start . Opening his eyes , he saw a shaft of sunlight already on the wall opposite . He pushed down the covers impatiently and half rose . Then he remembered about Liffey and felt suddenly hollow and empty . He lowered himself slowly onto his pillow and pulled back the bedclothes . There was no need , he told himself , to get up this morning to let Sally in from the dawn patrol . The old man lay still , listening , trying to identify the noise that had awakened him . From the kitchen came the snap of the refrigerator door , the clink of dishes , and the rush of a faucet . Quite suddenly an aroma of boiling coffee permeated the room . The fragrance of it roused Mr. McHugh so that he flung back the covers and got to his feet hastily . For several seconds he had to rest his hand on the bureau to steady himself till the dizziness that always followed a bad night had passed . One by one the familiar array of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his best pipe in its box , his wife 's picture , a leather-bound Bible , and the electric razor he had never used . Finally his eyes came to rest reluctantly on the latest addition  --  a well-worn dog collar . He picked it up slowly and sat down on the edge of the bed . With careful deliberation he slipped the end of the oily collar through the buckle and fastened it securely . Then he stared thoughtfully at the empty circle cradled in his hands . " You up , dad ? " Sally called from the kitchen . Mr. McHugh started . " Certainly , I 'm up , " he called back . " The coffee 's boiling . " The old man got to his feet again , placed the collar on the bureau , and began to pull on his clothes . He took his time , partly out of a sense of irritation with himself at having overslept and partly out of unconscious reluctance to face the changed pattern of his day . Ordinarily he got up after his daughter left with Liffey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , he had the coffee boiling and the dog 's warm milk ready for him . Here , this morning , Sally had set up a new routine without as much as a by-your-leave . Mr. McHugh made his way to the dinette in silence and sat down . Sally looked at her father 's face anxiously . She noted the pouches under his eyes and the absence of his usual ready smile . " How did you sleep , dad ? " she asked cheerfully . The old man shot her an indignant glance . " How do you think I slept , " he demanded , " after what hap-pened ? " " Oh ! " Sally murmured . The sooner he got his coffee , she thought , the better . Humming busily , she placed the steaming percolator on the table and laid a plateof scrambled eggs before her father . With quick efficiency she slipped bread into the pop-up toaster and then poured each of them a cup of coffee . Mr. McHugh , watching her closely , pointed at her plate . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought I 'd skip them , dad . If I 'm not to have my morning workout with Liffey , " she added with determined lightness , " I had better . Seems funny , does n't it , " she went on , trying to put what she knew her father must be thinking and feeling into words , " not to have him begging for tidbits ? " Mr. McHugh 's cup dropped to his saucer with a thud . He gripped theedge of the table and leaned forward . Then his pent-up hurt broke loose . " You killed my best friend last night , " he said resentfully , " and now you 're making a joke of him . " Sally put her own cup down slowly . " Oh , dad ! " she exclaimed . " How can you say that ? " " That 's what you did , " Mr. McHugh added stubbornly . Sally looked at her father . She saw the anger in his face and , beneath it , confusion and hurt . She had often seen one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manly pride struggled against an emotion he would not admit or did not understand . " But you agreed , dad , " she said quietly . " Dr. Wade phoned you from the office and asked you . I heard him . " Mr. McHugh stirred his coffee so violently that it spilled over the saucer and onto the fresh linen doily . " He took me unawares , " he muttered . " You both did . " " But Dr. Wade explained it was the humane thing to do , " Sally added . " The arthritis had spread to Liffey 's spine , and his legs were giving out . " The old man 's jaw set stubbornly . " I could have managed him . " " But , dad , Liffey was -- - " Sally began , and she bit her lip to keep herself from saying " Liffey was my dog . " Although he had been given to her as a puppy , he had never been her dog , not really . With an Airedale 's innate contrariness , Liffey had chosen her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother 's death and later her father 's retirement from the Post Office , the two old boys had become boon companions . Mr. McHugh poured himself another cup of coffee . " Your mother never would have had Liffey put to death . She loved that dog . " 66 // Sally 's cheeks flamed . " Oh , dad , " she exclaimed , " you 're being so un-reasonable ! " She got to her feet abruptly and began to straighten up the kitchen with angry , hasty gestures . Mr. McHugh picked up the morning paper , ready at his elbow . Usually he briefed his daughter on the news as he read , but this morning nothing could be heard in the kitchen but the rattle of dishes and silverware . " I 'll take this into the living room , " he announced finally . " Maybe it 'll be quieter in there . " When Sally came into the living room , she found her father seated in his corner of the davenport . With his hands resting idly on the paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brooding and alone , without the familiar figure of Liffey stretched out at his feet , Sally felt suddenly ashamed of herself . She sat down on the edge of the davenport beside her father . " Dad , " she said impulsively , " you 'll just have to get yourself another dog . " Mr. McHugh sat up straight . " I 'll never get another dog ! " he exclaimed . " Never ! No dog could ever take Liffey 's place . " " Oh , I did n't mean another Airedale , dad ; just a small dog , to take on your walks with you , one like Tessie , maybe . " " Tessie ? " " That small dog that belongs to Mrs. Whaley , in Section B. You know whom I mean . " " A lap dog ! " Mr. McHugh snorted contemptuously . " What do you think I am ? " " But , dad , you 'll be so lonely without Liffey . " " I 'm never lonely , " Mr. McHugh contradicted . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy . " He picked up the paper and gave it his undivided attention . Sally sighed with relief . If her father would n't have another dog , that meant they could move , then , out of the shabby , old West View at last . Without a dog , they could get an apartment in the Manor Arms , three blocks away . It would be wonderful to have everything fresh and new and bright ! A reliable oven and drains that were n't clogged half the time ! " I 'd better rush now , " she said . Then she stepped across the room and began to strip the soiled slipcover November ' 86 from Liffey 's chair , an overstuffed one by the window . " This can go to the laundry today , dad . " After she had removed the plastic undercovers from the seat and arms , she stepped back . " My , that looks nice ! " she exclaimed . " I 'd forgotten how pretty it is . " Mr. McHugh did not look up from his paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the forehead . " I 'm off now , dad , " she announced . " You will take your walks as usual , wo n't you ? " " The mail goes through , " Mr. McHugh answered with an emphatic nod . Sally laughed . " Now , you sound more like yourself . The laundry 's by the door , dad , and the money 's on the bookcase . If you have time , will you see why the iron wo n't heat ? There 're sandwiches in the refrigerator and some soup you can heat . Good-by , now . " " Good-by , " Mr. McHugh murmured , but he did not look up till he no longer heard Sally 's heels clicking down the front stairs . Then he stared hostilely across at the unfamiliar-looking chair . Fresh and bright from beneath its coverings , it blurred his mental picture of Liffey , nestled comfortably on the seat with his bewhiskered chin resting on the arm and his old eyes blinking contentedly . " Clearing him out , " Mr. McHugh muttered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of irritation , he tossed the paper to the floor and yawned aloud . Then he yawned again and rubbed his eyes . For a second he glanced at the afghan , invitingly arranged over the back of the davenport . Slowly he shook his head in rejection . He had known too many retired letter carriers to nap their lives away , men like Stephens and Gillespie , for instance , who had gone on the pension with him . Both of them had spent the better part of their days dozing on the davenport , only to end up , within a year after their retirement , stretched out in their coffins . He settled himself more comfortably in his corner , folded his hands , and closed his eyes . In a few minutes his heavy breathing echoed through the room . After a while , he began to dream that he and Liffey were taking the seminary walk . The dog , full of mischief , pranced along with the leather lead in his mouth and tugged his head rebelliously from side to side . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a motorman clanged his bell repeatedly . Only , as it grew louder , it sounded more and more like a buzzer . Finally the familiar sound penetrated Mr. McHugh 's consciousness and woke him . " Quiet , boy ! Quiet --  " he began , and then he stopped . The buzzer shrilled through the apartment again . The old man rose from the davenport slowly . " All right ! All right ! " he muttered . Without bothering to speak over the house phone , he released the catch on the entrance . Before he opened the door , he heard the laundryman whistling his way up the stairs . " Good morning , Mr. McHugh , " he called . " Where 's your old pal ? Why ai n't he sounding off ? " Mr. McHugh opened the door wide . " Good morning , Ben . " Ben dumped the fresh laundry on the nearest chair . " Gosh ! " he exclaimed . " That stuff gets heavier every day . " He ripped the bill from the top bundle . " Two-forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't he sass the bell when I rang ? " Mr. McHugh took the slip in his hand , checked it deliberately , and then paid Ben . " Liffey 's gone , " he said . " We had him " ? he slipped into the easiest way of telling the news ? " we had him put to sleep last night . " " What d' you know ! " the laundryman exclaimed . " Why , only last week I said to the missus if ever I seen an old dog on his last legs , it was Liffey . " An old dog on his last legs . The words echoed harshly in Mr. McHugh 's mind , where the image of the young and handsome Liffey of his dream still lingered . " Yes , sir , I said to her if ever I seen --  " " There 's the stuff to go out , " Mr. McHugh interrupted and pointed to the laundry ready by the door , but Ben made no effort to pick it up . " The missus always asks about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ben paused expectantly , waiting for the question that did not come . " We 've sold all the pups but one , Mr. McHugh , " he rattled on , undaunted by the old man 's unusual lack of response , " all but that solemn fellow I told you about , the one I call Sober Sides . The missus says we may have to give him to the old folks ' home . " Mr. McHugh tapped his fingers on the bookcase impatiently . Somewhat abashed , Ben picked up the soiled laundry . " Well , I got to be on my way now , " he announced . " You do n't know of anyone who 'd like to buy an Airedale pup cheap , do you ? " Mr. McHugh shook his head . " Well , if you hear of anyone that does , would you give me a ring ? I 'll put the number here on the laundry slip for you . " He scribbled the number hastily on the paper . " Say --  " he began , looking speculatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess you wo n't be getting another dog . " " No , " Mr. McHugh said . " I 'll never get another . " Ben shrugged his shoulders . " Well , I guess you 're right , " he said , misunderstanding the old man 's words . " It 's like I keep telling the missus , none of us are getting any younger , are we ? Well , so long , " he added and started down the stairs . " Be seeing you . " Mr. McHugh shut the door hard . Then he crossed the room to the davenport and sat down again . " ' None of us are getting any younger , ' " he quoted indignantly . " I might as well enjoy myself then . " He settled himself more comfortably . When the buzzer rang twice , he merely nodded his head in recognition of the mailman 's ring . Then , refreshed by the self-indulgence of his leisurely morning , he went down to the entry for the mail . Too late to turn back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly above and minded everybody 's business , already at her mailbox . Hearing his step , she turned . " There 's mail for you , " she announced . " It 's a federal offense to interfere with the mail , " Mr. McHugh said . He lifted the letters from the box and stuffed them into his pocket , but the gesture of indifference did not escape Mrs. Denton . " Oh , I did n't touch your box , " she protested . " I just looked in . Those letters are most likely for your daughter anyway . " Mr. McHugh opened the house door and held it for his neighbor . Without recognizing his courtesy , she stepped through . She paused on the landing before Mr. McHugh 's apartment and faced him . " I heard you had that old dog of yours done away with last night . " Mr. McHugh straightened his shoulders so that he looked taller than 5 ' 10 " . " That 's right , " he said . " I always say dogs do n't belong in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she started up the next flight , " but you 'll miss him . You wo n't know what to do with your time without him . " Mr. McHugh opened his door . " I can put it to good use , " he flung over his shoulder , " minding my own business . " He shut the door behind him quietly and stood still , listening . In a few seconds he heard the door above bang shut . " I got her goat that time , " he said with a nod of satisfaction . Remembering the mail , he pulled it out of his pocket and examined it carefully . There were two letters for Sally , one from her college association and the other a bill from one of the department stores . He laid the letters beside the laundry slip and glanced at the little clock on the table . " Only 10:30 ! " he exclaimed . Then he stepped into the kitchen to verify the time by the electric clock . " 10:33 . " He picked up the iron and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he muttered . He got his metal tool kit from the cupboard and took out a small screwdriver and a rusty pair of scissors . Next he rummaged through the oddly assorted contents for some bicycle tape and finally dumped the box upside down on the table . Sighing , he sat down and began to rearrange the contents . Subjecting each article to a continued on page 80 continued from page 63 careful scrutiny , he stacked the old locks , hinges , sockets , and small coils of wire at one end . Then he glanced at the clock again and slowly began to sort out the stray screws , nuts , tacks , and nails . He put them into their proper containers and placed them all at the other end of the box . On top he tucked the small hand tools , pencils , and tubes of plastic wood and liquid cement . As he worked slowly and deliberately , he found himself thinking about Mrs. Denton 's parting remark . Why would n't he know what to do with his time ? he concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't he ? Well , he 'd follow it , then . That 's what he 'd do . With an emphatic gesture , he snapped the box shut . " Eleven o'clock , " he announced , almost loud enough for Mrs. Denton to hear , " and time for the seminary walk . " From the bedroom he got his dog-walking clothes , an old topcoat , and a worn felt hat . As he let the apartment door bang shut , he flung a defiant glance up the stairwell . That old busybody might as well know that he was on schedule for his morning walk , dog or no dog . Outside he found a bright spring day with a nip in the air that made him button his coat and turn up the collar . He set off at his firm , steady pace for the seminary . Once there he started around the grounds . When he turned the second corner , he saw the man who owned the female boxer coming toward him . The two men always met about midway in the block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to romp . Acting on impulse , Mr. McHugh cut across the street . Suddenly annoyed at himself for having panicked , he headed for home , without stopping , as usual , to get the first edition of the evening paper . When he re-entered the living room , he dumped his coat and hat on the nearest chair and stood for a few seconds , letting the silence of the empty apartment flow around him . Then he stepped into the kitchen and glanced at the clock . " Only a quarter to 12 . " He sat down , re-examined the iron , and began to repair it . As he workedpainstakingly , unconsciously drawing out the little job , the phone rang . Before getting up to answer it , the old man finished tightening a screw . When he picked up the receiver , Sally 's voice , a little shrill with excitement , greeted him . " Hello , hello ! " she repeated . " McHugh speaking . " " Is that you , dad ? Are you all right ? " " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go out for your walk ? " " Certainly I went . " " Well , 1 mean  --  that is , did you fix the iron ? " " I 'm working on it now . " " That 's fine , " Sally said . " What did you want ? " Mr. McHugh asked bluntly . " Why did you phone ? " " I  --  why , I wanted to know about the iron , " Sally lied . " Well , it 's O.K. now , " the old man assured her , quite aware of her petty deception . " You can put it out of commission again as soon as you get home . " Sally laughed aloud . " Oh , dad ! I 'll be a little late today . I have to  --  to stop somewhere . Good-by , now . I 'm due on yard duty . " " Good-by , Sally . I 'm a busy man meself . " Back in the kitchen , Mr. McHugh finished the job on the iron . He got his lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he washed the dishes and left the kitchen almost as neat as he had found it . In the living room , he settled himself in his corner of the davenport . At a loss forhis paper , he found himself glancing again and again at Liffey 's chair , so unfamiliar without its faded slip cover and shaggy occupant . He stared off into the distance and tried to think of something further to occupy himself . There did n't seem to be anything left he needed to do . Mr. McHugh sighed deeply . Reluctantly he glanced at the clock on the table beside him . " Only two ! " he exclaimed . He picked up the clock and held it against his ear . Then he set it down slowly . Promptly at 2:30 he put on his coat and hat . As he left the apartment , he banged the door behind him . " On schedule , " he said , loud enough for Mrs. Denton to hear , " for the afternoon walk . " From force of habit , he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down Osage Avenue , Liffey 's favorite street , where his enemy , the Kerry blue , lived and where old-fashioned front gardens came down to the tree-lined brick pavement . Even before Mr. McHugh saw the Kerry blue , he heard him . By the time he came abreast of him , the dog stood with his front paws on the iron gate . Seeing the old man alone , he cocked his head to one side and barked sharply . Mr. McHugh paused and looked at the dog . " Your old enemy 's gone , boy , " he said . " You 'll have to find yourself another one . " As he spoke , the Kerry blue 's ears stiffened . Then he sat down snugly on his haunches , stared at Mr. McHugh , and barked twice  --  staccato barks of indignation . The old man smiled to himself and continued on his way . When he reached the park , he started on his customary stint , three times around the pavement . He strode along , the fresh breeze , now warm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed some object he knew Liffey would have paused to investigate  --  a few wilting crocuses , bushes with the damp earth spaded up around them , an unwary squirrel , and some animal crackers a child had dropped . The second time around , he caught a glimpse of old man Milner and the retired fireman already on their bench , jawing away and waiting , no continued on page 86 continued from page 80 doubt , to question him about Liffey . Quite suddenly he turned off from the park and headed out the avenue on what was usually the rainy-day walk . He followed the route faithfully , all ten blocks of it , but found little of his customary pleasure in his favorite pastime . By the time he reached the apartment , he felt unusually tired . A glance at the clock told him that he could take 40 winks before Sally came home . He stepped over to the davenport , picked up the afghan , and stretched out . " Maybe Stephens and Gillespie were right , " he muttered , and he sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzzer , three quick rings , awakened him . By the time she opened the apartment door , he had thrown back the afghan and settled himself in the corner . Making quite a business of crossing his legs , he greeted her with his usual question : " Well , what 's new at the brain works ? " A bag of groceries clutched in her arms , Sally sat down in Liffey 's chair . " Nothing special , " she answered . " But guess what ? " she asked , and her eyes shone . Mr. McHugh , not yet fully awake , fumbled with a box of Kleenex nearby . ' What ? " he asked . " I stopped --  " At that moment Sally saw the afghan in a rumpled heap at the other end of the davenport . The sight of it reminded her of what her father had often said about Stephens and Gillespie . Oh , dear , she thought , he 's been napping on the davenport most of the day . A sudden , inexplicable fear dampened her enthusiasm to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arms . " Well , go on , guess what ? " the old man prompted . " Why , I  --  I got sweetbreads for supper , " Sally finished lamely . " Nothing 1 like better . There 's the laundry slip and the change and two letters for you . " " What 's this number , dad ? " Sally asked , and she held up the laundry slip . " Oh , that 's Ben 's phone number . He still has one of his pups left . He thought I might hear of someone who wanted one . Take it to school with you . Maybe one of the teachers might like to buy a pup cheap . " Sally glanced at her father quickly . " I 'll check this later , " she said , and she stuffed the laundry slip into her pocket . As she bustled about the kitchen preparing dinner , she tried to think only of the sunny , attractive apartment she had seen at the Manor Arms , especially that heavenly yellow-and-gray kitchen with the electric stove . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nagging worry persisted . What had her father done with his day , and how did he really feel without Liffey ? She took pains with the meal , frying the sweetbreads in slices the way her father liked them and whipping the potatoes into flaky mounds . When she called Mr. McHugh to supper , he grinned with pleasure at the sight of his plate . " That looks fit for a king , " he said . " Did you meet the boxer this morning ? " Sally asked , trying to piece her father 's day together . " Oh , yes . " " And the Kerry blue ? " Mr. McHugh nodded . " He sassed me out . " " Was Mr. Milner in the park this afternoon ? " " Certainly , certainly ; jawing away . " Sally ate for a few minutes in silence . " Dad , you 're not eating much , " she said finally . " I am so , " Mr. McHugh contradicted . " You heaped my plate ; that 's all . " He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either . " That pie 's from the new bakery , dad , " she said . " Do n't you like it ? " " Oh , sure , it 's fine , " the old man commented . " It ca n't come up to your mother 's , though . I never tasted a store pie that could . " Sally laid her fork down , her appetite for her own pie suddenly gone . Twice today she had heard her father mention her mother , each time with a sense of loss . He had not spoken that way for three or four years . Maybe it was time they moved to another place , where there would be no memories and no associations . Later in the evening , she would tell him about the apartment she had seen . Planning to move might be a good diversion for him  --  what he really needed just now . When Sally came into the living room after finishing the dishes , she found her father sitting as he had been in the morning , staring idly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked . " The paper ? " Mr. McHugh repeated , as if the question had brought him back from a long way off . " I did n't get it , " he answered frankly . Sally stood for a moment irresolute . Then she picked up her pocketbook from the bookcase . " I 'll run across the street , dad , and get one so we 'll know what 's on television . " Before her father had time to remonstrate , she had let herself out of the apartment . Surprised to find the night colder than she had expected , she hurried across to the corner store . She had picked up a paper from the counter and was selecting some candy bars from a rack when she heard her name spoken . She turned to find Mrs. Whaley , the neighbor who owned the little dog , Tessie ; beside her . " Miss McHugh , " she said , " I 'm so sorry to hear about Liffey . " Sally glanced at the woman 's face and noticed that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued from page 87 down at the other end of the davenport . Her eyes wandered from the screen to the faded wallpaper , the yellowed paints , and the worn hardwood floors . She bit her lip to hold back her tears and forced herself to watch the program . Just as the commercial came on with a blast , the buzzer shrilled through the apartment . Sally jumped to her feet . " I 'll get it , dad . " " Turn that rumpus off first , " Sally switched off the dial . Then she released the catch , stepped out on the landing , and hurried down the steps . She found Ben waiting right inside the door with the pup in his arms . " He 's a natural for your dad , " Ben whispered as he shifted the pup to Sally 's arms . " He 's made for an continued on following page old man , that 's for sure . " " He 's quite an armful , " Sally said , and she pulled the check from her pocket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He snoozed all the way over and he 's kind of limp and sleepy . " " Thank you so much for bringing him . " " Do n't mention it . " " Sally ! What is it ? " Mr. McHugh called from the living room . " In a minute , dad . " Sally tucked the pup 's oversized paws in more securely and carried him up the steps . She shut the door of the apartment with her foot and stood for a second to catch her breath . " What were you --  " Mr. McHugh began and , seeing the pup , stopped . A frown of displeasure creased his forehead . Sally set the young dog down on his feet . He shook himself hard and lifted his head . He looked around the room slowly and spotted Mr. McHugh . Then he stepped across to the davenport , sat down before the old man with one haunch sprawled puppy fashion , and stared at him . Sally seated herself unobtrusively on the davenport . " Ben brought him , dad , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McHugh nodded . He leaned forward , still frowning , and held out his hand . The pup got up and came toward him . He smelled his hand thoroughly ; then he set about licking each finger with his bright red tongue . Gradually the old man 's face softened , and almost unconsciously , he began to scratch the pup behind the ears in the exact place Liffey had liked to be scratched . The pup stood quietly , blinking with contentment . Finally he opened his mouth and yawned so hard he squealed . Mr. McHugh chuckled . " Are we keeping you up , boy ? " he asked . He smiled down at the dog and waved his arm in the direction of Liffey 's chair . " Have a seat , wo n't you ? " The pup twisted his head quizzically , the way an Airedale does . Then he turned deliberately and stepped across the room to Liffey 's chair . He sniffed it thoroughly and climbed up on the seat . Having settled himself comfortably , he arched his neck so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced at her father . She saw him smiling indulgently at the pup , his face relaxed and softened . Then she , too , looked over at the dog . The bright light of the nearby lamp shone on his jet-black saddle and brought out the golden brown of his muzzle and sprawling paws . " He 's sort of fresh and new looking , is n't he , dad ? " she commented . " He moved in fast enough , if that 's what you mean , " Mr. McHugh replied , and he began to hum a tune . " Know that one ? " he asked . Sally shook her head . " ' Where the River Shannon 's flowing , ' " her father sang in a voice that quavered slightly . " ' Where the three-leafed shamrock grows . ' Shannon ! That 's what I 'm going to call him . " He picked up one of the candy bars , broke it in half , and handed Sally the other piece . " I always name my dogs " ? he paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the rivers of Ireland . "
