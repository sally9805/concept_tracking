The Latin American nation was the last member of OPEC ( Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ) to agree to the cartel ' s price- and production-cutting agreement reached in London Monday. // Even with its oil revenue ( which will now come from 1. 7 million barrels a day instead of 1. 8 million ) , the government has been forced to adopt some economic measures considered drastic here. // On Feb. 28 , President Luis Herrera Campins decreed new regulations that would control the outflow of foreign currency and indirectly devalue the bolivar from 4. 3 to about 8 per dollar , a rate that will fluctuate on the open market. // To some , the precipitous drop of a currency that had been stable since 1960 signifies the end to Venezuela ' s stupendous oil boom and dollar wealth of the 1970s . Others have expressed relief that after three years of relative economic retraction and uncertainty , the bolivar will again find its true value , thereby halting the exit of dollars from the country. // A long time in the making , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by non-OPEC producers in the North Sea - Britain and Norway - then by Nigeria , an OPEC member . The specter of an international oil price war sent shock waves through Venezuela , where the government suspended the sale of dollars two days later. // ' ' If changes occur in either ( oil ) production or prices , it is logical that the government must consider reorienting its petroleum policy and the economy , ' ' an Energy Ministry spokesman explained before the OPEC meeting in London. // Venezuela has two major industries , construction and oil . The former is the principal source of domestic employment , while the latter earns most of the country ' s income , including about 80 percent of its foreign exchange , which it uses to import 70 percent of what it consumes. // The currency controls established a system of differential exchange rates in an effort to stem the capital flight , estimated at $170 million a day the previous week. // The government will apply a high rate of 4. 3 bolivars to the dollar for public debt service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For other purposes , it will exchange bolivars for dollars at a fluctuating rate. // Since Venezuela lacks diversified national industry , the demand for imports will continue , although most people will now pay about twice as many bolivars to obtain import dollars . To prevent rampant inflation , however , the government froze all prices for 60 days . It is not certain what will happen after price controls are lifted. // Furthermore , observers wonder whether the other fiscal measures , considered temporary , will stem the outflow of money from the country which reflects the Venezuelan penchant to buy foreign goods and services. // At home , Venezuelans prefer to buy imports , although these cost more than the few national products available . Even the government , local newspapers claim , purchases its staples abroad . During the past generation , middle-class Venezuelans have grown accustomed to semiannual shopping forays to Miami. // In the past , the nation compensated for its lack of national industry and tendency to buy foreign with an enormous oil income , estimated at $19 billion last year . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales dropped about $3 billion , while its foreign debt rose to an estimated $32 billion. // Given the debt repayment problems recently encountered by Mexico , Argentina , and Brazil , foreign lenders exerted pressure on Venezuela to meet substantial loan obligations coming due this year. // In this turbulent atmosphere , the threat of oil production and price cuts in OPEC could have sown chaos here , had the government not acted . In fact , on Feb. 25 , two days after the initial announcement of exchange controls , international banking sources stated their willingness to refinance some Venezuelan loans. // Individuals and institutions holding dollars could double their money here , and observers will certainly watch for an increase of foreign investment . Venezuelans themselves will be encouraged to invest at home if ' ' the exchange controls , complemented with other measures , reactivate the national economy by reestablishing confidence and creating investment incentives , ' ' remarked Luis Nunez , publisher of the newspaper El Universal. // ' ' If the controls aren ' t correctly applied , the greatest burden will fall upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Dr. Nunez said. // Together , these sectors make up the vast majority of Venezuela , now an urban society . Although Caracas , the capital , boasts a downtown vista of skyscrapers and sumptuous middle-class suburbs , like most Venezuelan cities it has a ' ' belt of poverty ' ' encircling it. // About half of all Caraquenos live in makeshift dwellings called ranchos and earn less than $600 a month , says Dr. Mercedes Vivas , director of the Caracas Agency for Social Development. // ' ' More than income , ' ' she explained , ' ' they lack access to services like medical care , water , housing , employment . ' ' In Campo Allegre , on the road to La Guaira , ranchos tucked into hillsides overlook a school recently built with government assistance in this neighborhood with few paved roads. // But Dr. Vivas added that it ' s clear that the government , one of the nation ' s largest employers , must reestablish priorities and cut some programs . But she expressed concern that cuts may include community development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campo Allegre and a food stamp program , approved but not yet in effect , which is ' ' an experiment to redistribute income outside Caracas to the 22 percent who earn less than $250 per month. ' ' // Furthermore , if government austerity sharpens the three-year recession , it could aggravate unemployment , which ranges from 10 to 20 percent in this nation of 15 million. // ' ' We are in for tough times , ' ' one political commentator said . ' ' But the nation is sound . We have a solid oil industry , a relatively small population , 25 years of political stability , elected government , and intensive education.
