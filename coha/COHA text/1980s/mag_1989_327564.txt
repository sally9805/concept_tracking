When Martha Page went to work as a trainee for Chicago 's Harris Trust , she soon learned that " all the women were required to type and the men were not . " Recalls another former Harris employee , Fran Hurwitz , who worked 15 years as a clerk : " Harris was your basic boys ' club . " Both women left the bank during the mid-1970s , but last week they got a measure of satisfaction when Harris settled a twelve-year-old Government suit charging the bank with race and sex discrimination . <P> Without admitting guilt , Harris said it would pay $14 million in back wages to thousands of workers . Nancy Kreiter , research director for a women 's advocacy group that helped push the lawsuit , called the settlement " a fabulously sweet victory . " But even before last week 's decision , the bank had come a long way . In 1977 Harris had five women vice presidents . Today it has 102 ( out of 380 ) .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
