txt he shop Is on the Rue des PetitsChamps , just off fashionable Avenue de l'Opera . Above the door , a large script rendition of the name of the patron : Paul Corpellet . In the windows and inside , an Impressive variety of high-quality Imported and prepared foods ? tropical fruits , quiches , caviar , and more ? and Corcellet 's own extensive lines of mustards and vinegars . A little Fauchon ? one of the finest groceries ' in Paris . BLit mat is n't way the name eaui corcellet is known in France . That does n't explain the five scrapbooks bulging with press notices in half a dozen languages . CORCELLET OWES HIS celebrity to what lies in the long freezer chests Just Inside the entrance . There , under the imprint of his Le Honda a Table brand of frozen gourmet foods , in orange-and-white packages , are double servings of escargots , bouillabaisse , coq au yin , and a few dozen more French , African , Spanish , Russian , and Chinese specialties . And mixed In , packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot pie , are what Corcellet calls his plate exotiques . These exotic dishes include lion ragout , grilled iguana , and various preparations of hippopotamus , bear , python , monkey , reindeer tongue , crocodile tail , and elephant trunk . Just which farout dishes adventuresome Parisians can find on a given day depends partly on the availability of animals ( Corcellet relies on a thin worldwide network of hunters ) and partly en the chef 's whim . " If I could get two times ? three times ? as much exotic meat as I find now , I would sell it all , " Corcellet says . Still , he admits to keeping some exotic supplies locked up in freezers while demand builds . " When there 's none left , " he adds , smiling , " people have something to talk about . " And they do talk . Some of the ComedicFrancaise crowd are among his customers . Likewise singer Charles Aznavour . That 's enough for many Parisian social climbers , who regularly phone to see what outlandish new entree is available , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snobisme , " sneers Corcellet . " If I make a marvelous cassoulet or coquille , It 's only ' blah , blab , blah ' . But if I make python . . : ! " CORCELLET , AN EBULLIENT , gesturing , balding man who smokes a pipe and wears polka-dotted lavallieres , has been a grocer 47 years . He got into the wild-food business two decades ago , first trying to lure Africans living In Paris with basic French preparations of meats native to their home continent . He experimented with lion , cooking it with mushrooms and other vegetables , changing combinations and techniques until his Gallic palate was satisfied . What he liked , he froze and put up for sale . Not only the Africans but the French bought . Soon he had an entire repertoire , from pate of bear to hippo in hot sauce . " A serious man , " Corcellet muses , " would make perhaps three kinds of vinegar and four mustards . But me ? I am serious but I also want to be a culinary vagabond : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always looking for something different . That 's a mark of a young mind . You know , there are old people who are young and young people who are old . Young spirits want to try new things . A customer will say , ' Ah , crocodile ! I have n't had that before ! That 's adventure In food . ? " If It 's something you can find anywhere It does n't interest me . I like the unusual and I like to cook as my imagination tells me . Following a recipe ? now a cup of sugar , now the next thing ? that 's very boring . I love imagination , la fantaisie . He put his imagination to work when he received his first python , about a dozen years ago . " I did n't know what to do with It , " he recalls , " so I tried to get to know it . I saw its beautiful skin and white flesh and I talked to it . I said , ' How am I going to cook you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about how they cook fish in the Antilles : with tomato and shallots and herbs . I began to pull off the skin , like a striptease , and that 's the style I used for the python , " TODAY , CORCELLET SUPERVISES a staff that cooks and freezes in a small kitchen a few minutes ' walk from his shop . The boss himself , who holds diplomas from a gaggle of French cooking academies , is constantly tinkering , creating . Python from Upper Volta , shipped whole ( up to 15 feet long ) and frozen , is the mainstay of his larder , the star of his freezer chamber . Lately , he 's been making . it in thick slices , lightly floured , and sauced with a mix of onions , shallots , thyme , laurel , garlic , and tomatoes , flambeed with rum . Elephant trunk is also sliced , in a clear broth . .. and cooked 16 hours . Crocodile he makes with a hot tomato sauce , sauce a l'americaine . He does a braised reindeer tongue with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get ? I ca n't have one every year . I first tried a pate with 50 per cent bear , the rest veal and pork . It was terrible , Finally , I found that 25 per cent bear tasted fine . " Hippopotamus is a very hard meat . You ca n't slice it . I often make it en daulm ? a stew . Ten hours of cooking in a sauce with white wine and herbs and onions . Then the sauce is passed through a sieve and it 's cooked a second time in the sauce . Or perhaps cubed in a sauce of saffron and curry . Or a ragout with green peppers . " As packaged , each double serving ( 25 francs ) is in a plastic bag , which is dropped into boiling water for 15 or 20 minutes , then cut with scissors . Convenience foods . ( Customs regulations here keep the plats exotoques from U.S. shores , so if you have if craving for monkey stew you 'll have to visit Paris and bring a hotplate to your hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say they 're delicious , thanks to Corcellet 's sauces and imaginative use of spices . They report that python tastes like a cross between meat and fish ; monkey ( which looks like human flesh ) is said to be similar to rabbit ; hippo has a strong taste unto itself . Corcellet refuses to discuss any of it . He crosses his arms , then uncrosses them . " When people ask me , ' How does a raspberry taste ? " he snaps , " I ask , ' How does a strawberry taste ? ' Each one tastes like itself . " All things are transformed according to how you use them . If you put a flower on the ground and walk on it , it 's nothing ; if a little boy gives the same flower to his mother It 's beautiful . It is exactly the same with a python or an elephant 's trunk .
