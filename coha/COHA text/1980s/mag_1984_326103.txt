SCANDAL , OR PRISCILLA 'S KINDNESS by A.N . Wilson Viking ; 233 pages ; $15.95 <P> The world is a wormy place in the seven satiric novels of A.N . Wilson . The deadly sins flourish there , as do those lapses of character and taste that can turn a serious life into a pathetic farce . At 34 , this precociously wise and productive British writer has pierced the intimidating exteriors of physicians , clergymen and scholars . Scandal takes on politicians , journalists , prostitutes , thugs , spies , not-so-innocent bystanders and that quaint ideal , the dutiful wife of a public figure . <P> That would be Priscilla Blore , helpmate of Cabinet Minister Derek Blore , the woman whose doubtful benevolent instincts are commemorated in the book 's subtitle . " Kindness , " in Author Wilson 's mischievous sense , comes to mean an unnatural state of grace . Priscilla is one of those exasperating people who appear poised under all conditions . She can be part of someone 's fantasy or grubby pursuit without misplacing a lustrous strand of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor , is allowed to worship her as an untouchable goddess . The physically and morally repugnant newspaperman Henry Feathers is granted bed privileges , partly out of pity and partly , as the author writes of this woman who is at her best in crises , because " like King Midas murmuring his secrets to the earth and stones , Priscilla needed a confidant who would be ultimately unreliable . " <P> Love in this sprightly , misanthropic comedy assumes two basic guises : Priscilla 's death grip on her family as a vehicle for social survival and Hughie 's foolish infatuation . Mainly it is betrayal that makes Wilson 's fictional world go round . Feathers deceives Mrs. Blore by exploiting her pillow talk in a sensational and highly profitable expos of her husband . Derek Blore , the Right Honorable Member for Wheat-bridge East , got the ball rolling with furtive visits to a prostitute named Bernadette for his ritual whipping . Blore enjoyed fancying himself a naughty schoolboy , a harmless diversion were it not for the Soviet agents who recorded his extracurricular activities on film . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson , former literary editor of London 's weekly Spectator and biographer of the humorist and Roman Catholic apologist Hilaire Belloc , is a lightning plotter . The action , however , is never as arresting as those who initiate it . The smitten Hughie is a striking example of what the author calls " an overdeveloped inner life . " Bernadette is a stinging portrait of stupidity ( a pimp recruits her with veiled threats , and she mistakes him for a social worker ) . Blore is an overbearing ass who makes a big production about serving a modest Spanish wine and talks of W. Somerset Maugham 's The Moon and Sixpence as if he has discovered the latest bestseller.
