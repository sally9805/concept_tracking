txt wHEN THE LABOR DEPARTMENT INSPECTOR pays a visit , business owners can be hurt  --  especially by what they do n't know . Ivan and Jean Cooper , who own and operate Ye Olde Ironmaster and Sir Beef Ltd. , two small restaurants in Reading , Pa. , have learned that lesson from bitter , firsthand exnerience In a compliance case brought against them in 1979 that 's still pending , the Labor Department contends the Coopers must pay $6 , - 000 in back wages to employees . It also says the couple owes another $6,800 in federal fines =CM for violating minimum-wage , overtime and child-labor regulations . Among other infractions , the Coopers were cited for allowing employees under 18 years of age to operate an electric meat slicer in preparing sandwiches and for not paying overtime wages to an employee the owners considered a manager . The Coopers insist that they were n't even aware of the fine points of the regulations and argue that they deserved a second chance . They also contend that the Labor Department has been devious , arbitrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick file of letters and other documents ( including appeals by his wife to Presidents Carter and Reagan ) , the 53-year-old Mr. Cooper sighs and says , " There lies 10 pounds of paper representing untold sleepless nights , heartaches and anguish . " But to the Labor Department , ignorance is no excuse . " An employer is responsible for knowing the . laws as they apply to his business , " says Dale Belock , an attorney in the department 's Philadelphia regional office . RESTAURANTS FACE a host of fair-labor rules and seem to have their share of problems abiding by them . But the Coopers ' experience demonstrates the vulnerability of business owners who do n't keep abreast of regulations . It also shows how draining a confrontation with government regulators can be . The Coopers say they were misled by W. Scott Royer , the Labor Department 's compliance agent who dropped in unannounced in the spring of 1979 . The agent wo n't discuss the case , but the department 's own report does n't show he informed the owners that the reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came here under the guise that he wanted to help us " with some paperwork , the 48-year-old Mrs. Cooper says . " We cooperated 100% , " giving him access to the books and letting him roam freely in both establishments  --  until it became clear they were going to be harmed more than helped . " Our lawyer said you should never be nice to federal people , that we should have thrown the guy out until we had a lawyer 's counsel , " she says . Labor Department officials say the agent did n't violate any procedures by withholding his true purpose from the Coopers . Besides , says Thomas Johnson , a wage-and-hour administrator for the department in Philadelphia , " there 's nothing that says the owner ca n't have a lawyer or accountant present . " THE COOPERS SAY they were stunned when the compliance officer fined them for having allowed minors working at Sir Beef to operate meat slicers . " We went to our Philadelphia lawyer and asked him about this rule , " Mrs. Cooper said . " It took him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how were we supposed to know about this if our lawyer did n't ? " The Labor Department says an employer can easily find out whether his business is in compliance with fair-labor laws . Says William Otter , administrator of the department 's wage-and-hour division in Washington : " If the owner has any doubts , he 's free to pick up a phone or go to one of our local offices for clarification . " The Coopers were caught off guard by another discrepancy : one restaurant manager who sometimes operated the cash register and took customers ' orders was paid a flat salary , even though she was putting in more than 40 hours a week . The law exempts employers from having to give salaried managers overtime pay , but the Labor Department applies its own tests to decide when an employee is n't entitled to overtime . Under one test , the compliance officer must determine that at least 60% of the employee 's time is spent managing and supervising the work of others . THE COOPERS ARGUED that their manager often had to lend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the department decided the employee was spending too much time on those tasks and disallowed the manager exemption . Besides having to pay back wages to the employee , the Coopers have been told to compensate an assistant manager and several other managers . Thomas Power , a Washington lawyer who has represented employers in Labor Department disputes , says he believes the government often goes overboard on the exempt-employee issue . " The Labor Department position seems to be that anything short of folding your hands and watching employees work is n't managerial , " he says . Adds Clyde Griffiths , acting general counsel for the National Restaurant Association : " When you come right down to it , there probably is n't a restaurant in the country that the Labor Department could n't find something on if it wanted to . " The Coopers ' ordeal is n't over . Both restaurants have been losing money lately and finances have become so tight that the couple had to sell their 1976 Cadillac and borrow money from family .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
