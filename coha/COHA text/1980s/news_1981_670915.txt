In a speech on the Senate floor , the California Democrat disclosed what he called recent evidence from " sources within the executive branch " indicating that Pakistan was building a horizontal tunnel in a hillside in the Baluchistan Mountains 40 miles from the Afghanistan border . United States officials , Mr. Cranston added , believe that the construction is probably for a test site for nuclear weapons. // Mr. Cranston , prime sponsor of the 1978 Nuclear Nonproliferation Act , also said that since February India has been undertaking " surface excavations for burial of a nuclear warhead for an underground test. " // // Expects Test in Few Months // " There is a high possibility that India will decide to make another test at the Pokaran site in the next few months , " he said . " And Pakistan could produce the fissile materials for a similar test , perhaps by the end of this year , most likely by the end of 1982. " // Mr. Cranston did not identify the sources of his information , but the intelligence community has recently given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources confirmed the gist of Senator Cranston ' s information , adding that the reports had generated considerable concern among high-ranking officials. // While there have been reports of renewed activity at Pokaran , the test site in the Thar Desert where the Indians conducted their first and only atomic test underground in 1974 , Senator Cranston provided the first specific information on potential test preparations by India . His speech also contained the first official American assertion that Pakistan is working toward nuclear testing . <> <> Aid to Pakistan Requested // The assertion of such Pakistani activity will complicate the Administration ' s request for $100 million in economic aid for the Government of President Zia ul-Haq in fiscal 1982 and its efforts to persuade Congress to modify a ban on military aid to Pakistan. // Representative Stephen J. Solarz , Democrat of Brooklyn and chairman of the House foreign affairs subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs , expressed irritation today when two State Department witnesses said that Pakistan had not provided , nor had the United States requested , assurances that it would not test a nuclear device. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we don ' t believe they could be obtained , " said Leslie H. Brown , deputy director of the department ' s Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs. // The United States has informed Pakistan of " our deep concern " about possible nuclear weapons testing , said Jane A. Coon , Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near East and South Asian Affairs . She added that because the Reagan Administration was just beginning to rebuild relations with Pakistan , " we ' ve got to gain confidence on both sides " before seeking such commitments. // Representative Jonathan B. Bingham , Democrat of New York and chairman of the subcommittee on international economic policy and trade , joined Mr. Solarz at the joint panel hearing in resisting the aid request for Pakistan " before we have had a chance to consider the substance and direction of both a U.S.-Pakistan aid program and this Administration ' s nonproliferation policy. " // Senator Cranston also vowed to tie the economic assistance to a Presidential commitment that Mr. Reagan would cut off any security assistance to Pakistan should it test a nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nuclear Nonproliferation Act that Mr. Cranston sponsored prohibits the sale of nuclear fuel to countries that do not agree to submit their nuclear facilities to international safeguards . Another restriction , the so-called Symington Amendment to foreign aid legislation , requires a halt to American military aid to countries that appear to be developing the ability to make nuclear weapons. // The resistance from key House and Senate Democrats today indicates that the Administration faces an uphill fight in its effort to change the Symington Amendment , named for former Senator Stuart Symington . The provision has been applied only to Pakistan. // The Democrats have also been pressing the Administration to present to Congress its new policy on preventing the spread of nuclear weapons , which a high-level interagency group has been drafting . <> <> Indian Aide Sees Need // Yesterday , K. Subrahmanyam , a high-ranking Indian military adviser , said in a Madras newspaper that India had to build a nuclear bomb not only to achieve military superiority over Pakistan but also to insure that India would not be ignored by the United States. // Senator Cranston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s nuclear potential is believed to be a major factor in its apparent decision to step up its nuclear program. // Pakistan has not confirmed or denied existence of a nuclear weapons program , but it has insisted that the main thrust of its nuclear program is to provide electrical power for the country. // Mr. Cranston warned that nuclear tests by Pakistan and India " would raise the specter of a regional nuclear war . " Last month , he made a similar speech saying that Pakistan had engaged in " clandestine construction of a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant , " and that Iraq could soon be able to make nuclear weapons . <> <> Mrs. Gandhi Warns of War // NEW DELHI , April 27 ( AP ) - Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India said today that proposed United States arms sales to Pakistan could precipitate a war between the two south Asian neighbors. // " Our only worry has been that such arms sales are creating a situation where everybody is drifting toward a war , " the Indian leader was quoted in a Government announcement as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major danger is that without anybody wanting it , suddenly , there may be a war. " // Mrs. Gandhi , who has frequently said American weapons sold to Pakistan in the past have been used against her country , told the committee there was " no question of trying to compete with Pakistan in an arms race . " She said India must " be prepared for any situation , " but did not elaborate. //
