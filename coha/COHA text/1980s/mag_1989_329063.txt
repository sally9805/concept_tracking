When Isaac Abraham , 38 , was growing up in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn , N.Y. , it was populated mainly by ultra-Orthodox Hasidic Jews . But by the 1970s , Williamsburg had experienced a large influx of blacks and Hispanics . Abraham now lives in a subsidized housing project where 49% of the tenants are white and 51% black or Hispanic , and race relations are often strained . <P> " When we got in ( ( the housing project ) ) , there was a struggle to survive . It was the late 1970s , and the vibrations from both groups was very hostile , very , very hostile . There was almost every day a major crime  --  people getting mugged , robbed , chains snatched , children beaten . And not people of both groups : the victims were always somebody out of the 49% . A kid who was sent down to the grocery , an adult would escort him . Forget the playground . Only one kind of people used that , and that was the people who created the nuisance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that time we decided we were just going to stand up and fight . Now if ( ( someone tries a mugging ) ) and we get him , you do n't know what will happen . "
