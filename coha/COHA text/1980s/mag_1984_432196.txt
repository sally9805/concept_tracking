 | SOMETIME in the late 1970s half the white rhinoceros population of Uganda suddenly disappeared ? a single rhino , probably shot by a gang of pogehess . At the time , nobody realized that it was one of only two left in the country . For almost eight years Uganda had been in chaos . Idi Amin was struggling to stay in power , tens of thousands of citizens had been murdered at his command , and the ordinary people of Uganda were frightened and hungry . To shoot any animal for food or needed cash was perhaps understandable . Today , as one would expect five years after the overthrow of Amin 's regime , Uganda 's wildlife is in less critical condition . But even with reduced poaching , there is no hope for white rhinos here with only one left . and now even the black rhinoceros , smaller cousin of the white , may be on the final lap toward extinction in Uganda . Always more numerous than the whites . black rhinos were also thought to be considerably less vulnerable to poaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep to thick bush . Nevertheless , according to Iain Douglas-Hamilton , who was employed as an adviser to Ugandan antipoaching operations in the early 1980s , there may still be six or so black rhinos in Uganda . No more than that . " Because of the war of liberation in Uganda , " Iain told me , " thousands of cheap automatic weapons became available . Almost anyone who wanted one could get one ? and they 're ideal for anyone who wants to poach .  | Under the circumstances , poaching is now quite a profitable livelihood for unscrupulous people . " These guys mean business , " he continued . " And since they are often better armed than the rangers who guard the parks and reserves , they 've had a free rein . Usually they 're going after elephants for the ivory , but if they find a rhino they 'll shoot it as well . They only want the horn ? they leave the rest to rot . " Iain is an internationally acclaimed elephant expert , and largely because of his work many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . * But the fate of the rhino has received far less attention . Even many conservationists are unaware that while there may be more than a million elephants on the African Continent today , the number of African rhinos has plummeted to fewer than 20,000 and continues to dwindle . THE UGANDAN EXPERIENCE is not unique . In Chad , Ethiopia , Somalia , Zaire , and Angola , raging civil wars over the past decade have also taken a heavy toll in rhino lives . Even in relatively stable , conservationconscious Kenya , where I live , the number of rhinos has dropped from 18,000 in 1969 to about 1,100 now . Similarly , in northern Tanzania poachers have wiped out 90 percent of the rhinos in the past ten years . Rarer still are the three species of Asian rhinos ? all quite distinct from the African types . The population of Indian , or greater one-horned , rhinoceroses left in India and Nepal has shrunk to about 1,700 . The Sumatran rhino ( also called the hairy rhino ) today numbers only about 500 , widely dispersed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malaysia , and , possibly , Kampuchea , Laos , and Vietnamnd with fewer than 70 animals the Javan rhino , restricted to the western tip of the island from which it takes its name , is considered one of the world 's rarest beasts . Years ago , when I first saw rhinos in the wild , I developed an immediate admiration for them . Second in size among land animals only to elephants , they are endlessly  | fascinating because of the great variation of behavior among the different species . With camera in hand I stalked white rhinos in Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda ? before the troubles there ? and was amazed at how unaggressive they were . I could pull my Land-Rover within several feet of them , and on foot get nearly as close . I remember creeping up downwind of a male that must have weighed more than 5,000 pounds to take a series of photographs showing the square lips that are so well adapted to plucking a few blades of grass at a time ( in fact , grass is the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized I was nearby , I was lying prone in front of him , completely vulnerable . But he simply ambled a little farther away . This docile nature of the white rhino is what makes it such easy prey for poachers . CONVERSELY , I have been charged by aggressive black rhinos ? which have also been known to charge at trains passing through their territory . A black 's bulky yet compact form ( sustained by massive amounts of shrubs , herbs , and fruits , but hardly any grass ) is no hindrance to speed . The animal can sprint at 35 miles an hour , and its extraordinary muscle structure gives it the ability to turn and change directions incredibly fast . When one of these creatures comes galloping toward you at top speed , its head swaying back and forth menacingly , making a thunderous noise each time its feet hit the ground and snorting loudly , your only thought is how to escape . Usually that means climbing a tree , but many of us are around to tell about charges simply because a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last moment , or because it had intended only an intimidating mock charge in the first place . But one can never assume with a black rhino . In the early days of Kenya 's parks . visitors were warned , " Find your rhino before it finds you ! " Totally unpredictable . these animals have been reported to enter campsites at night , scatter smoldering logs of a fire , then peacefully walk away . They are inclined to curiosity , which leads some people to believe that what sometimes may appear to be a charge is actually only an attempt to investigate . Rhinos do n't have very good eyesight for distance , and I think this is what causes them to behave erratically when disturbed . It is not always easy to find a black rhino before it finds you , however . The animal is elusive in heavy bush , and the oxpeckers that accompany it serve it as an effective early-warning system . Yellow- or red-billed birds about the size of starlings , they pry ticks , flies , and other insects from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when an intruder approaches ? which doubtless has saved more than a few rhinos from the arrows or bullets of poachers . The poachers , however , obviously have not missed all their opportunities . APPALLED by the ever increasing number of rhino carcasses being found . many of them with gaping holes where their horns had been removed , I set out to learn what the market for rhino products was , why the market apparently had grown larger , and what kind of prices were being paid for rhino parts . That investigation took me throughout Africa , into the National Geographic , March 1984  | Mideast , and later ? in cooperation with the World Wildlife Fund , the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources , and the African Wildlife Foundation ? to India , Southeast Asia , Korea , Taiwan , and Japan . I got my answers , and a couple of surprises . In Africa the only place where there is real demand for rhino products turned out to be South Africa , especially in the muti shops of Johannesburg and Pretoria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these shops an array of herbal and animal products ? including rhino ? is sold . Dr. K. M. Naidoo , a retired practitioner of homeopathic medicine and the proprietor of one of the largest muti shops in Johannesburg , told me that Zulus would buy a little powdered rhino horn to mix with dried lice , which they swallowed to treat jaundice . " But I actually sell more rhino hide than rhino horn , " he said . " Whatever for ? " I asked . " Zulus have a multitude of uses for it , " he replied , " both medicinal and , well , kind of magical . For instance , they 'll sometimes burn a piece of it inside their homes , believing that its vapors will chase away evil spirits . They also eat a bit of rhino hide to stop a nosebleed or prevent ill effects from snakebite . I can sell a piece just an inch square for five dollars . . . . If you 're really interested in the sale of hide , though , you ought to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the available rhino hide comes from ranches there , where surplus old male white rhinos from the parks are stocked for sportsmen from abroad to shoot . Most of the trophy seekers do n't want the hide . The manager of one of the game ranches in Natal told me he used to sell a lot of rhino hide before the government banned its export . Export ? " I thought it was n't sent out of the country ? that it was used by Zulus instead , " I said . " Just a small fraction , " he responded . " Wholesale , I could get a lot more by selling it to a Chinese merchant who sent it to Hong Kong . He used to pay me $30 a kilogram 2.2 pounds , and since the average white male rhino yields about 120 kilos , that meant one hide was worth 53,600 ! " That was all very interesting , but it did n't explain why rhinos had been slaughtered elsewhere in Africa in the 1970s ? little or no hide had been taken from them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horn ? The middlemen who encouraged hunters to supply the horn on a scale hitherto unknown would not disclose any information , but it was widely rumored that planeloads of rhino horn were leaving international airports clandestinely and that dhows , the old wooden sailing ships that have plied the Indian Ocean for centuries , were also carrying the horn , stashed under their legitimate cargoes . It was said that the Chinese used rhino horn as an aphrodisiac , and that they had been buying it since ancient times . I had no firsthand information to confirm that supposition , and , frankly , it seemed rather fanciful that a demand for love potions could escalate so greatly . Nevertheless , I was willing to accept the idea that it could well be a traditional use for rhino horn that had recently been spurred . " Look for some traditionally oriented people who have suddenly become rich , " I told myself . So I went through the rhino-horn statistics from the days when such trade had been legal . I was searching for a place on the Indian Ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had found new wealth , perhaps from the discovery of oil . The old export records showed that Aden once bought rhino horn . That was no help ! Whatever prosperity Aden once enjoyed has gone by the wayside . I began to feel that I must be on the wrong track . Then I thought of a country that had been closely associated with Aden ? North Yemen . It does n't have oil , but Saudi Arabia right next door does , and North Yemen in the 1970s had just opened up to the outside world . A few weeks later I flew to Sanaa , the capital of North Yemen . Just how I was going to find out whether rhino horn was in demand here , I did n't quite know . However , I thought a good place to look for it would be in the suq , one of the most colorful marketplaces in all Arabia . 411  | I was looking for the quarter where jewelry is sold when I found myself amid an array of stalls in which craftsmen were busily making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yemeni men wear daggers , called jambiyya , and they are loath to part with them for any reason . In the suq dagger making was a major activity . There were scores of people sharpening blades , sewing belts , and carving handles . I noticed among the carvers one who was carefully collecting the shavings from the floor of his stall . " What are you going to do with them ? " I asked . " There 's someone who has offered me a good sum for them , " came the reply . I picked up some of the shavings and was sifting them between my hands 412 when the carver opened a big box . " You see , " he said , " they 're special ? not like ordinary dagger handles , which are made of water-buffalo or cow horn . " Curious , I peered over his shoulder into the box and saw a dozen rhino horns ! " This is what we use for making the best jambiyya handles , " he explained . I must have stood there gaping for several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to be one of the poorest countries in the world . An eight-year civil war that ended the way only in 1970 succeeded in overthrowing the autocratic imams who had wielded the sole political power in the country . Prior to that time few Yemenis traveled abroad , but af- terward many began seeking jobs in Saudi Arabia , where they helped on construction National Geographic , March 1984 They 're  | projects and earned very high salaries . Their money flowed back into North Yemen at the rate of about three million dollars a day in 1978 . As a result , Yemeni men could then afford daggers with rhino-horn handles ; formerly such adornment was the prerogative of a very small elite . It was mostly the Yemeni demand for rhino horn that caused the wholesale price to go up from $35 a kilogram in 1974 to $500 in 1979 . This 15-fold increase in the value of rhino horn in just six years led illegal hunters in Africa from the Sudan all the way south to Namibia to go after rhinos . An average of eight tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1979 ? at a cost , overall , of some 22,000 rhinos ' lives . Even though the North Yemenis were buying more rhino horn than any other people in the world , I discovered that their market accounted for less than half the total . That 's when I decided I must go to eastern Asia . Not only could the journey help me de ' termine if , in fact , rhino horn was used as an aphrodisiac , but it also could lead me to an explanation of what had happened to the Asian rhino populations . IN THE TRADITIONAL medicine shops in Singapore , my first stop , I began to doubt the stories of rhino horn as an aphrodisiac . I saw a lot of other animal products being sold as sexual stimulants ? dried lizards , monkey brains , sparrow tongues , deer tails , rabbit hair , and tiger penises ? but no rhino horn . For other purposes , yes , as I would notice again in larger pharmacies in Hong Kong , Macao , Taiwan , Thailand , Japan , South Korea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | and Burma . But in interviews with more than 400 practitioners of folk medicine , as well as rhino-horn importers , wholesalers , and consumers , I came across rhino horn as a love potion or a cure for impotence only in parts of western India . My conclusion is that the belief that peoples of the Far East use rhino horn for sexual purposes is wrong . I also noticed that wherever rhino horn was used as a medicine , the Javan , Indian , and Sumatran species were preferred . But because of those species ' growing scarcity , customers are turning more and more to the African horn . The retail price for African rhino horn in Manila or Singapore is the equivalent of $11,000 a kilogram . Asian rhino horn is considerably more ; in Mandalay it retails for a staggering $20,000 a kilo . Customers , of course , buy only a minute quantity at a time , never more than a few grams ( far less than an ounce ) . Still , the cost is greater than it would be for almost any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I found the oddest medicinal use of a rhino product . Zookeepers in Rangoon collected the urine of a baby rhino to be drunk for the cure of sore throats and to ward off asthma attacks . " We give it to anyone who asks for it , but I . think elsewhere it 's actually sold , and in much larger quantities , " one keeper said . He was correct . The Calcutta zoo earned $750 in just one year from the sale of an old rhino 's urine . Strange , perhaps , but at least the animals do n't have to be killed for it . In Nepal I learned that the death of a rhino can have religious significance , for in Nepalese Hindu mythology the rhino is a special sacrificial animal , whose horn was given to it by Lord Vishnu . In a rite called the Blood Tarpan , which every Nepalese king is required to perform upon his accession , rhino-blood libations are offered to the Hindu gods . In Kathmandu I met Gen. Kiran Shumshere Rana . Though not a king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Nepalese Army and the son of a former prime minister ? and he performed the Blood Tarpan at age 19 . He told me how he had gone to Chitawan Valley , where the country 's only rhinos lived  | and which had become the private preserve of the Ranas , to hunt a suitable animal , These Indian rhinos are a ferocious species , and their thick , folded skin , covered with tubercles resembling iron rivets , gives the impression of metal armor . But from atop an elephant , the young man brought a large male down with a single shot . " Then , " he said , " a team of helpers dragged the rhino to a nearby riverbank , where , using special knives , they disemboweled him . I climbed into the abdominal cavity they had made in the rhino and sat in its blood up to my waist for a few minutes while the Hindu priest officiating at the ceremony offered prayers . When I was directed to do so , I stood up , my hands cupped with rhino blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my mother . " Later I ate the meat between the hoof and ankle of one of the rhino 's legs ; the rest of the meat I gave to the villagers . " In January 1981 the same rite was repeated by Nepalese King Birendra , just outside what has become Chitawan Park , in honor of his late father , King Mahendra . Although the rite requires the death of a rhino , it is so important that it guarantees the survival of the greater one-horned rhino in Nepal . No fewer than 500 armed soldiers guard the Chitawan rhinos . As a result , their numbers have risen from 160 in 1966 to 375 today ? and there has been no rhino poaching inside the park since 1976.  | BECAUSE of the present demand for rhino horn and hide ? and the high prices being paid for them ? I fear that present conservation methods are not adequate to ensure a future for rhinos outside zoos or a few isolated reserves . The international community is only beginning to accept the necessity of attacking the problem by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think we have to worry about the Indian rhino species . Not only in Chitawan Park but also in Kaziranga Park in Assam , India , their numbers are increasing ? from 970 in 1975 to 1,600 today , with another hundred or so outside the two parks . In fact , Kaziranga may have to relocate some of its rhinos to other Indian parks in the near future . The other two Asian specias ? the Javan and the Sumatran ? present special difficul-ties . There is not a single one of either of these in any zoo in the world today , let alone a breeding pair . Despite money and expertise provided by the World Wildlife Fund for Ujung Kulon Nature Reserve , there are probably only about 65 Javan rhinos alive today . Any let-up in their protection , or an outbreak of disease , could bring their extinction . I feel strongly that a small breeding group should be transferred to some place where modern scientific facilities could help them breed more successfully . Although there are more Sumatran rhi-nos ? some 500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few scientists to have attempted a detailed study of this spe-cies , Markus Borner recently spent three  | years in Gunung Leuser , one of the two areas where they are said to be most plentiful . " Yet in all that time , " he told me , " I actually saw only one ? when it charged through my camp quite unexpectedly ? and that was just for a matter of seconds . " IN TOTAL NUMBERS , however , it is tropical Africa that is losing the most rhinoceroses . And it is too much to expect that countries destabilized by revolutions and civil wars will have much room on their agendas for the plight of the rhinos . Wildlife expert Ian Parker sees another side of the problem . " Conservation is attempted today through the barrel of a gun , " he told me . " We rely on paramilitary forces equipped with the gadgetry of modern warfare  | because conservation does not receive popular support . It is , instead , a source of tension , a matter of ethics and priorities at odds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many wildlife species are to survive . " South Africa has shown that where the citizens support conservation , it can succeed ? aided by an enlightened park management with adequate manpower and skilled administrators , all of them highly trained , motivated , and disciplined . Consequently , the country 's black rhino population is increasing by more than 5 percent a year , and the number of white rhinos is growing at such a rate that culling will probably be necessary within 20 years . It would be preferable , of course , if the surplus animals of South Africa 's reserves and other African private game farms could be used to restock areas where the rhinos are going or are already gone . That is impossible , however , until the animals can be protected ? and until consumers stop their demand for rhino horn , that seems very unlikely . I HAVE JUST RETURNED from another trip to Asia , where I tried to get wholesalers and retailers to substitute water-buffalo hide for rhino hide ( they are used for the same medicinal purposes ) and saiga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anthropologists to go to North Yemen to take on a study of how to convince the Yemenis to use another material for their dagger handles . But more important than any of those things might be to get , for the first time , the full mutual cooperation of conservationists , wildlife administrators , traders , and lawenforcement officers . Those hornless carcasses rotting in the sun are a blight not only on the landscape but also on the conscience of mankind .
