No one stays out late anymore . By 10:30 p.m. , even on Fridays , the streets of Port-au-Prince are empty . That is when the shooting begins . In the fancy neighborhoods on the hill and in the slums down by the water , armed men , often in uniform , sometimes in civilian clothes , break into houses , beat the residents , ransack the premises . They steal whatever suits them . No one really knows who they are , what they are looking for . But almost every morning , someone finds a fresh body lying on the street , a bullet through the head . The violence is making everyone wary of men in olive green . <P> When Jean-Claude ( " Baby Doc " ) Duvalier fled Haiti early last year , jubilant crowds danced in the streets and chants of " Liberty ! " filled the air . Duvalier 's departure ended 28 years of totalitarian rule and brought hope to Haitians that the military , which helped bring down the dictator , would cooperate in rebuilding their impoverished country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haiti . The three-man provisional government headed by Lieut . General Henri Namphy is worse than ineffectual ; the elections scheduled for next month threaten to turn into a sham ; and the forces of order , as in Duvalier 's days , continue to terrorize the people . <P> In his 1966 novel The Comedians , Graham Greene described a similar time in Haiti : " No one dared move on the roads at night ; it was the hour when only the zombies worked , or else the Tonton Macoutes . " That infamous paramilitary force of Dr. Francois ( Papa Doc " ) Duvalier and his son Baby Doc was disbanded by decree after Jean-Claude fell from power last year , but in spite of repeated promises , it was never disarmed . The provisional government has prosecuted only a few of the most notorious thugs . " It is n't easy to get rid of something as basic as the Macoutes , " says Aubelin Jolicoeur , a Haitian journalist and former gossip columnist . The recent rampages have a signature style that has led many Haitians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late-night assaults , the beatings of entire families , the arbitrariness , the brutality . <P> But then , there are the olive-green uniforms , a disturbing sign of army complicity in the murderous attacks . The rule of law is nonexistent . In August , Louis Eugene Athis , one of seven major presidential candidates , was killed along with two campaign workers by a machete-wielding crowd in a small town south of the capital . In the northwest at least 200 peasants from a land- reform collective were massacred in July by vigilantes believed to be in league with a few large landholders in the area . <P> With the countryside in a state of undeclared civil war , an umbrella opposition coalition called the Group of 57 organized numerous national strikes and demonstrations . The aim of the protests , they said , was to dislodge or reform a government that has repeatedly violated Haiti 's new constitution . At the height of the protests this summer , the day was rare when the ramshackle boulevards of Port-au-Prince were not blocked by barriers of flaming tires . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the air grew cooler , bands of boys played soccer around the debris . By evening , the thick black smoke enveloped the city . The sunsets were brown .
