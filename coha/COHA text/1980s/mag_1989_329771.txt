Kelly Cutlip was driving along a Los Angeles freeway in June 1988 when a speeding Toyota with a drug-dazed 22-year-old woman at the wheel traversed crazily five traffic lanes , crashed broadside into his pickup and gave him the ride of his life . Cutlip , 36 , a marble mason from nearby Irvine , found himself strapped upside down as the truck skidded on its roof at 60 m.p.h. , sparks flying past his head like an acetylene shower in a metal shop . " That 's it , " he announced to his wife that night . " That 's the clincher . " <P> Within two months the Cutlips had sold their house and moved with their four children to Seattle , with no job and few friends , but with a determination to find a less stressful life . Today the family is settled in the wooded suburb of Issaquah in a cedar split-level that cost them $110,000 less than their California home . Even if Kelly 's income has dipped 20% , his commute is mercifully brief . At the wheel , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a backfire for fear it might be a highway shooting . " We were tired of being in the fast lane , " says Mary Cutlip , 36 . " We wanted a more peaceable , low-key way of life . We wanted our kids to grow up at a slower pace . " <P> As it happens , ten of the twelve other young families on their block in Issaquah are also from out of state . For the Cutlips are part of a " northward-ho ! " movement of new settlers , mainly from California , who have been streaming by the tens of thousands toward the inviting frontier of the Pacific Northwest . The influx into dynamic areas like Seattle and , to a lesser extent , Portland , Ore. , is urbanizing a once rural hinterland and intensifying the Northwest 's already bitter debate over local growth . <P> Many of the new migrants are young , middle-class families from Los Angeles and Orange County . According to University of Southern California geographer Thomas Jablonsky , their flight represents the first net " out migration " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are relatively skilled and prosperous , and mobile enough to escape Southern California 's well- advertised problems of traffic , smog and crime . Many are so-called equity emigres who cash in on their California houses to acquire equivalent property near Puget Sound at literally half the price . Last month 's Northern California earthquake , however , has had little impact on the exodus . A poll by the Field Institute showed that though many Californians expect new quakes , only 2% say they are likely to move out of the state for that reason . <P> Thanks to the new arrivals , the Seattle area is growing as fast as a Sunbelt mecca . In the past year , Washington has gained 100,000 people , most in the twelve-county Puget Sound Basin . A survey by Seattle demographer Laurie McCutcheon for the Puget Power Co. showed that in 1988 the fastest-growing area , suburban King County to the east of Seattle , received 12,700 new households from out of state , 22% of them from California .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
