txt os ANGELES ? Jerry Zucker is holding a corkscrew and staring at the bottle of beer the corkscrew has been sent to open . It is a measure of his current importance , he says with mock seriousness , that Paramount has sent him the tool for champagne . In Hollywood , success brings instant benefits . " Airplane ! " ? written and directed by Jerry Zucker , his brother David , and boyhood friend Jim Abrahams ? opened in theaters July 2 . The next day , they found they had Meetings scheduled with 17 executives and producers , several of whom had turned down " Airplane ! " once or twice . During its first week , " Airplane ! " sold more than $7 million in tickets . The high-spirited parody of disaster movies , which cost $3.5 million and is less than 1 V : hours long , has been praised by the critics . The core of nearly every review has been relief and giddy pleasure at a movie that is short , inexpensive , and funny ? " a remedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies , according to Janet Maslin , a critic for the New York Times . Will success spoil the three young men from Milwaukee whose first shows were performed with teddy bears on the steps leading down to the Zuckers ' liv ? ing room ? " We 'll keep our next movie below $30 million , " David Zucker , 32 , said . " We could work for the next 10 years on $30 million , " his 30-year-old brother added . The final embellishment of the thought belongs to Abrahams , 36 . " We 'll keep our whole careers under $30 million . " ONE MISTAKENLY assumes that the three men . ? who have crammed their movie with such jokes as the satirical rendering of the steamy " From Here to Eternity " love scene in the surf in which the lovers end up covered with seaweed and a dying catfish ? would be as full of buffoonery as their movie . Instead , they cowered at a card table in the center of a disco dance floor , surrounded by neon stars and flashing pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Saturday Night Fever " spoof inside " Airplane ! " and a Paramount publicity agent had chosen it as an appropriately zany location for an interview . Despite the delicious nonsense and slapdash quality of " Airplane ! " the movie was not improvised but carefully crafted over five years . The script was revised 30 times . " In the first draft , we had one good joke per page , " David Zucker said . " In rewrites , there would be four jokes per page , and jokes at the low end , were weeded out . " " Every time we thought we were at the end , " Jenry Zucker added , " we 'd go home , read the script , come back , and one of us would say , ' This thing seemed great a month ago , but it is n't working now . ' " From their earliest days in Wisconsin , they have followed a two-out-of-three rule . They have no pride of authorship , no dividing or credit into " this is mine and that is his . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue for or against an idea , once the vote is taken it is over . THE TIIREE MEN , referred to at Paramount as " the boys , " consider themselves " entertainers , not filmmakers . " While Jerry Zucker was still attending the University of Wisconsin ? the two others already had been graduated ? they rented space in the back of a Madison bookstore and created " Kentucky Fried Theater , " a mixture of live and videotaped skits they wrote and acted . The show was successful enough for them to bring " Kentucky Fried Theater " to Los Angeles in 1972 . They spent $35,000 on a 10-minute 35 mm. film of four vignettes they hoped would be the basis of a " Kentucky Fried Movie . " " Kentucky Fried Movie , " which they wrote but did not direct , was financed by the United Artists Theater Circuit . It cost $700,000 and has grossed $20 million. , The genesis of " Airplane ! " was " Zero Hour , " a 1957 Wile Andrews-Linda Darnell movie about an airliner placed in jeopardy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to sell " Airplane ! " unless they could direct it themselves . Some studios refused . Some , like American International Pictures , agreed but in return wanted total creative control . A great deal of the humor in " Airplane ! " comes from four lean-jawed heroic B-movie stars ? Peter Graves , Leslie Nielsen , Robert Stack , and Lloyd Bridges ? playing with utter earnestness , respectively , the food-poisoned pilot with an odd sexual proclivity , an absurdly reassuring doctor , an airline trouble . shooter who rips off his pair of dark glasses to reveal another pair underneath , and the glue-sniffing head of airport operations . EXECUTIVES INTERESTED in the " Airplane ! " project wanted to cast it with comedians . " They said , ' llow can you do a comedy with no comedians ? ' " David Zucker said . " They told us to get Dorn DeLuise , Harvey Korman , Bill Murray , Chevy Chase . Our concept was that straight actors would be a lot funnier . " " Luckily , " Jim said . " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paramount was also making ' Star Trek ' ? a Si million budgel versus a $45 million budget . They divided their concern accordingly . " As to their plans after 17 meetings with executives who want to make a deal for their next movie , Abrahams lowers his voice to a whisper . Actually , . he - says , " ' Airplane ! ' is the second movie in the third trilogy of our airport movies . Our next one ' will be ' The 747 Strikes Back . " New Yak Times News Swim
