Every now and then the over-the-counter market produces a Cinderella stock  --  a stock so successful that it sweeps into the big time , leaving behind it a trail of similar issues that soar in price on investors ' hopes they , too , will make the quantum leap . Last year ' s Cinderella was Tandem Computers Inc. , a former OTC company that exactly a year ago staggered Wall Street with its results for the December quarter . Net income unexpectedly soared to $27. 1 million from $11. 6 million a year earlier ; Tandem ' s stock price jumped to 57 1/2 from 35 1/8 , and within a few months the little-known OTC company became a highflier on the New York Stock Exchange . " Tandem ' s numbers shot all the lights out , " remembers Barry Bosak , computer analyst for F. Eberstadt &; Co . " It became the proxy for every other OTC technology stock . Tandem made it , " says Mr. Bosak . And that , analysts say , triggered such a run on OTC computer stocks that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Friday  --  one year from its staggering earnings announcement  --  Tandem again created pandemonium among the OTC computer and technology issues . Tandem said Friday that preliminary results for the 1987 December quarter indicate the company ' s revenue will come in below expectations . " It appears that domestic business fell short of our expectations , " Tandem said . That set off a chain reaction that sent prices of computer and other technology stocks reeling Friday , not only in the OTC market but on the exchanges as well . Indeed , computer stocks led Friday ' s big sell-off . " They just lined them all up and gunned ' em all down at once , " says Mr. Bosak . By the time the market closed Friday , Apple Computer had plunged 4 1/2 to 40 ; Sun Microsystems slid 5 to 35 1/2 ; Microsoft tumbled 3 3/4 to 56 3/4 and Lotus Development was off 3 to 30 1/4 . And the damage spilled over into semiconductor stocks that supply the computer markers : Intel dropped 2 1/2 to 26 ; LSI Logic was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday where prices were already slipping on boosts in interest rates , the technology sell-off was enough to trigger the big arbitrage programs that balance stocks in the Standard &; Poor ' s 500 against traded options on that index . Brokers began dumping the S &; 500 stocks , and by late Friday afternoon other large OTC issues that are part of the S &; 500 collapsed in price as well . Among the biotechnology giants , Genentech , the OTC market ' s biggest , fell 4 1/4 to 42 3/4 ; Cetus dropped 3 1/4 to 14 1/2 ; and Amgen was off 2 1/2 to 31 3/4 . Among the biggest retailers and jobbers , Nordstrom fell 2 3/4 to 21 1/4 ; Price Co. tumbled 2 3/4 to 32 . Lin Broadcasting slipped 2 1/2 to 42 1/4 and Liz Claiborne dropped 2 to 16 . Not surprisingly , the Nasdaq 100 , an index made up of the largest 100 industrial stocks on Nasdaq , slid 6. 2% to 316. 39 , almost in line with the collapse in the Dow Jones industrials . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop in the full Nasdaq industrial index , which slid 4. 5% to 346. 13 . But , interestingly , the January effect , which provides only that small OTC stocks do better than large exchange-listed issues for some time in January , continued Friday despite the plunge . The small OTC issues , in general , fell much less than anything else . And many individual investors were actually buying small issues Friday . In fact , the gainers among small stocks included a number of depressed computer and biotechnology issues , largely issues bought primarily by individuals because their market value  --  in the $25 million to $60 million range  --  makes them too small to interest most institutions . Among small medical-equipment stocks , ADAC Laboratories was up 3/8 to 2 1/2 and Cooper Development rose 1 3/8 to 10 7/8 . Little drug and chemical stocks also included a number of gainers . Chemex Pharmaceuticals rose 7/8 to 5 ; and Praxis Biologics rose 1/2 to 5 3/4 . Praxis was 15 3/4 a year ago . Often small OTC stocks follow the larger issues by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysts don ' t expect much to happen to these issues this time . " I don ' t expect these stocks to go right back up , " says Mr. Bosak , " but a lot of the smaller OTC issues have already fallen to below book value . Where are they going to go ?
