txt The last of the airline-fare bargains is on the way out . Major airlines , which have been boosting basic fares for months , are trying to increase revenue by eliminating deep-discount fares on domestic routes . The move promises to make travel costs substantially higher for vacationers , who make the heaviest use of such discounts . The action also ends a pricing duel between American Airlines , which popularized the deep discounts under the Super Saver name , and Delta Air Lines , which has favored a more conservative approach to price strategy . The fact that Delta won the duel attests to the growing national strength of the Atlanta-based carrier . Under proposals filed with the Civil Aeronautics Board . deep discounts under Super Saver fares would be slashed 20 percentage points . Travel costs during mid-week , currently 45% off coach fare , would be changed to a 25% discount . Travel during the weekend , which rates a 35% discount , would be revised to a 15% discount . In addition , tighter restrictions are being put into effect for the fares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days in advance , depending on the route , will have to be purchased 30 days in advance . And the minimum stay , currently requiring only a Saturday , will be boosted to seven days . The higher prices and tighter requirements are scheduled to go into effect for travel beginning Dec. 1 , just in time for the Christmas travel season . American Airlines introduced the deep discounts in January 1977 . Robert Crandall , president of American , believed that discounts as deep as 45% on coast-to-coast trips would make sense , even for the carriers . Initially , executives at other airlines were frightened as the deep discounts helped trigger the first decline in airline yields , or average fares . In years . However , as it turned out , the discounts generated so much new business that they helped fill empty seats and proved profitable , at least for transcontinental airlines . Mr. Crandall 's strategy had worked . Gradually , the deep discounts spread to shorter-haul markets , where it 's thought they are less effective in generating new traffic . And restrictions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually crumbled as competitors sought pricing advantages . The strategy behind the deep discounts began to fail as restrictions were relaxed and full-fare customers switched to the cheaper fares . George James , economist at the Air Transport Association , said in an interview that by this summer almost 66% of airline traffic was on reduced fares , up from 25% to 35% of traffic on cut-rate fares in earlier years . The average discount was 43% last August . In recent months , American sought to keep the deep discounts while tightening the restrictions . It proposed restoring the 30-day advance-purchase requirement . But UAL Inc. ' s United Airlines cut that to 14 and Delta , which had never liked the deep discounts , cut the advance-purchase provision to seven days . " Delta , " says one securities analyst . was just trying to put pressure on American to get rid of those deep discounts . And with its financial muscle , Delta could afford to keep the pressure on as long as it wished . " The Delta maneuver hit long-haul carriers such as American , United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switched to the discounts because of lax restrictions , the long-haul carriers had to give up lots of revenue . But Delta , with shorter hauls , suffered much less . " We think Delta is trying to send us a message , " Wesley Kaldahl , American 's vice president , marketing resources , said a few weeks ago . By Oct. 1 , American had received the message . On that day it filed new Super Saver fares with the CAB , restoring the restrictions as well as slashing the discount fares . On Oct. 6 , Delta matched American Air 's move with its own filing with the CAB .
