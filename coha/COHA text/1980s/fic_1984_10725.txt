WARD AYthe job ? Of course , a certain amount . And I have emotional difficultiesof my own . I must often make decisions that shorten and even take life . When I must isolate populations to prevent the spread of disease , and sometimes even withdraw medical assistanceto allocate it to areas where help will still matter , I all but sweat blood , On the other hand , I have been able to help enormous numbers of people . We have a large number of burn cases in Dallas , many of them scarred to the point of crippling : refugees from the South Texas firestorm , some of them profoundly crippled . I was a part of the committee that decided to allocate sufficient social resources to these people to prevent their dying of starvation or neglect and also to house them in public facilities . We do make decisions in favorof life whenever we can . I live in an apartment at the Adolphus Hotel , along with the rest of the British here .

Until the Southwest Area is reclassified as safe , the rest of us may not bring our families in . So I have two lonely rooms with a long view to the south . The hotel service has been maintained quite well , so I am comfortable . Most of our foodstuffs and all of our liquoris imported . The food is all tinned , unfortunately , because we can not risk building lifetime dosage to dangerous levels if we are to remain in our jobs for any length of time . So we can not eat local food or drink local water . Dallas 's water supplies are from lakes , so there is a definite radiation problem , persisting even now . In the summer , long-half-life particles blow up from the south , and in the winter they come down from the north . There is one saving grace here , though , and that is the people themselves . These are terribly determined people here . In fact , we have encountered few Americans who have not responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dallas normallyworks a six-day week now , and goes from eight to six . I have met some of the bravest and most wonderful people I have ever known here . I will never forget their calm courage in the face of death , nor their willingness to expose themselves to danger for the sake of others . THE WEST 41During the flu , for example , our main problem was keeping victimsisolated from people who wanted to help them and were willingto endanger themselves to do so . At present we are turning away three-quarters of the applicants for paramedical training , because the teaching staff must concentrate on doctors . People in the paramedic job are exposed to contagious disease and radiation as a matter of routine . Another example of the high morale involves farmers . When we must condemn produce  --  which happens less and less often now , I 'm glad to say  --  you would expect anger on the part of the farmers . We have come to anticipate complete cooperation . When crops are suspect , the farmers themselves are the first to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in , looked like it had blown up from the south , " they might say , and assist us in checking the shipment for hot particles . They can be trusted to give the food to the disposal teams for burial if necessary . And these are all people who have known starvation in the most personalterms . I recall that we sent out an emergency call for cleanup teams after the hot thunderstorm in April of 1989 . There were hot spots all over Dallas . And by ' 89 it was all long-half-life stuff . This radiationwas not going to dissipate . We got more volunteers than we had gear for them to wear . People who were already triaged volunteered to work without protective clothing , which was in short supply . I think that the city was probably saved as a viable human community by the men and women who gave what remained of their lives during that cleanup . Fortunately , most of the local thunderstorms are generated over Oklahoma and North Texas , so a hot storm coming up from the south is rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Dakotas , but this is not too severe . Most of that flow is southeastward , and affects the Midwest . NOTE : At this point Mr. Shandy 's breakfast arrived . This is the morning menu of a British Relief officer : one fried egg , one sausage , two kipper fillets , one bowl of oatmeal with cream , one small pot of tea , and one tablet of vitamin C.Mr . Shandy ate his breakfast and made two telephone calls , one to the Relief 's human resources pool requesting a Spanish-speak-42 WARDAYing interpreter to accompany him on a field trip , and another to the Centers for Disease Control to inquire whether or not they were ready to try some newly designed kits intended for testing whole blood for contamination by what he referred to as " exotics . " He did not offer to expand on the content of these phone calls . After his breakfast he asked us what we most wanted to know from him . We requested that he tell us of his experiences in and around San Antonio . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in May of ' 89 . There were many people living between Houston and San Antonio who had been out of touch with the outside world for seven months . As it did throughout the country , the electromagneticpulse destroyed most of the televisions and radios , along with computers , radar stations , medical equipment , and car ignitions . Add the bombing of San Antonio to the general chaos , and one can see that the conditions would be truly terrifying . Initial reaction in rural communities was to go toward the cities . We must recall that in less than a second a silent and invisible EMP burst had plunged people from the twentieth century to the Middle Ages . So they knew absolutely nothing of what was happeningbeyond the borders of their own towns . People who could have direct-dialed Tokyo one second could not telephone the county sheriff the next . The disorientation was extreme . So they went toward the source of communications , which was the cities . But in South Texas this was a terrible error , because San Antonio was in flames . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countryside  --  notmany from San Antonio , but hordes from Austin because of the fire and Houston because of fallout . Many Houstonians , in their confusion , went toward San Antonio , not away from it . Apparentlythe traffic jams to the east and north of the city were so bad that escape westward was the only alternative . The sheer massivenessof the attack on San Antonio created damage and injuries previously unexpected . There were large numbers of people with sight loss due to flash effect even miles from Ground Zero . Others suffered not only burns but toxic reactions to synthetic-fiber clothingthat had melted into their skin . Like the other cities , San Antoniowas struck with airbursts and groundbursts , creating aTHE WEST 43massive dust cloud . The large number of huge weapons detonatir simultaneously at first blew immense quantities of dust into tl air , then created updrafts that drew it upward where it mingle with particles created in the fission phase of the explosions . Conditions in such places as Lavaca , Gonzales , and DeWi counties were appalling . The populations had quadrupled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran out very quickl Radiation sickness was virtually epidemic and was followed shot ly by all the diseases we have come to associate with large grout of undernourished , debilitated people . Although we arrived in Dallas three months after Warday , was not until three more months had passed that we were org nized enough to arrange an overflight of San Antonio and Soul Texas . We were in an SC-7 Skyvan loaded with extra fuel tanks the rear of the passenger compartment so that we could accor plish a round trip to and from Dallas if ground conditions were t ( unstable to permit us to land . You must recall that we had be ( broadcasting into this area on all available bands for some month and getting no response . Military recon flights indicated an exte sive population . So we did not know what to expect . The Comm sioner wished to determine whether or not to extend Briti ; Military Rule to the area . This has not been done in many parts the United States , but it is generally considered for areas whe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the loc authorities are not able to cope . We flew as far south as Seguin , which is thirty miles from S ; Antonio . To avoid ground radiation we did not go below three the sand feet , but rather observed through binoculars . Seguin prov to be largely burnt . At that time I got a look at the condition of San Antonio . I i member being astonished that this little city had been so terra devastated on Warday . People had hardly even heard of it in Br ain . One would have expected Los Angeles or even Houston befo San Antonio . Of course , it has since come out that a good part the planned Soviet attack did n't go off , so in a sense San Antor was simply unlucky . The Soviets had given it first-strike priori because of the extensive U.S. Air Force repair and refitting fac ties there , and the huge complex of military hospitals , the aton44 WARDAYsupplies dump at Medina Base , and the presence of a mechanized army that could have been used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as seal the Mexican border . Perhaps , also , they knew that American intelligence did not expectthis particular attack , and considered that there was value in surprise .  --  It is no wonder that the American military prohibits photographyin such places . The effect on national and indeed worldwide morale would be very negative . From a distance there is nothing to see but the black landscape and the gleaming fused earth around the Ground Zero points . The land is mostly flat , with some rolling hills to the north . Although I never went to San Antonio before the war and had never met anyone from there , my first experience of that blasted corpse was , quite frankly , shattering . I sat at the windowof that plane unable to move , unable to speak . The cabin was silent . After a time we simply flew away . We soon found ourselves over the town of Yoakum , Texas , which showed on our charts as a population area of approximately eight thousand people . There wore two tent communities to the south of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various vegetables , but looked to be in poor condition due to post-blast weather effects . There were numerous horses about , many of them hitched to cars and pickup trucks from which the engines had been removed to lighten them . Our appearance caused a great deal of excitement in the town . People rushed out of houses and buildings waving sheets or articlesof clothing or just their arms . We were able to land on State Highway 77 on the outskirts of town . There was a local airfield , but the runway was too cracked to justify the risk of using it , and the road seemed solid . The first to meet us were a man and a woman on horseback . They had rifles in holsters on their saddles , and as they came to astop they drew them . I 'll never forget the first question , from thatlean , bewhiskered man with the hollow eyes : " Y'all from Russia ? " They thought they had lost the war . This was , we were to find , generally the assumption in isolated populations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at once escorted into town . We had variousemergency medicines , and our orderlies soon set up an aid stationwith the equipment we had brought . Our station was placed in the showroom of a local Ford dealership , the Wendell Motor Company . This offered us a large floor space and limited access via two doors . At the same time , the people waiting outside could see for themselves that we were working as quickly as we could . Ampicillin , keflex , and tetracycline were our main supplies , along with morphia and heroin for pain sufferers . We also carried cyanide and copies of the euthanasia rules . Cultural resistance to this program is very strong , especially in rural America . But people usually come to understand that truly unspeakable suffering ought to be relieved by death if the victim has no scruples of conscience , or is indeed begging for it . On that first day in Yoakum , our three doctors and six medical orderlies treated 211 of the thousands who presented themselves . The actual local population was approximately fifteen thousand at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able-bodied individuals . It was fortunate that we brought the four soldiers , because violent disagreements kept breaking out among the patients , especially as to whose dying children were to have the first chance at the antibiotics . On that day we performed sixteen pediatric euthanasias , for the most part on children suffering both pain and brain damage from radiation or other poisoning . We found numerous cases of mental breakdown . Paranoia , schizophrenia , catatonic withdrawal were all present in the population . Our psychological pharmacopoeia consisted of a little Thorazineand Valium . We dispensed what Thorazine we could to the schizophrenics . We recommended that the mentally ill who were unable to function be euthanized , with the consent of their families . Nobodyvolunteered their psychotic relatives at first , but the prospect of being free from the burden of their presence caused people , as is usually the case , to come to us in the night to get the cyanide capsules . We also faced numerous cases of partially stabilized radiation sickness . These individuals were usually covered with sores from48 WARDAYsecondary infections and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their situation , most of them willingly accepted the death alternative . Because of their oaths or religious objections , many British doctorshave refused to dispense euthanasia treatment , so this aspect of the program was left to me . I spent my days living out tragedies with the victims , and my nights in dreams of indescribable horror , where I heard them calling me from the grave , and imagined that I had accidentally buried them alive . But it was n't true , I was not the shadow of death . To these people , with their burns and their sickness and their tormented bodies , I was mercy . Among the problems with which we could not cope were the various parasitic diseases . They are not much of a problem in Britain , and we simply failed to anticipate their presence here . Hookworm , tapeworm , ascaris , and giardiasis were the most serious of these . These diseases were in adults unattractive and debilitating , but in children they were devastating . The acuteness of the problemcan be realized when one reflects that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one almost absent of proteins , were being consumed from within by their own worm loads . We instructedon the use of saline enemas , developed by the CDC as a means of temporarily reducing infestation , especially in the cases of hookworm and tapeworm . But the only real relief , namely proper medication and a good , clean source of food and water , simply was not available at this time . Our contamination specialist surveyed the area in some detail , and found it seriously affected by radiation . Most of the population was radiation-poisoned to some degree at least . There was also malnutrition . Only a few children were free of rickets . Pellagra , the old curse of the South , had reasserted itself . We realized , during that first day , that we were in the presence of a whole world , small though it was , that was dying before our eyes . There were only two babies under the age of six months . One had been blinded and had lost a hand , and the other was suffering from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weaver , reported that they buried five or six people a day , generally in shallow graves in a field near the THE WEST 47old town graveyard . The local Catholic priest , Father Menendez , and the Baptist minister , Mr. Harold , officiated at the brief ceremonies . Our one overwhelming wish was to radio out and somehow get great loads of food and clothing and , above all , medicines for these people . But we knew exactly what would come : little , and too late . Instead we settled on a recommendation , which we presented to the sheriff and the two religious leaders the next day , that the whole population start moving north . A hundred miles closer to Dallas there were communities that were still very much intact . We also offered to send what supplies we could down from Dallas , but we could n't provide much . The situation was stark . If they stayed , all of these people were going to die . As the sheriff pointed out , a lot of them would also perish on the journey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many informationmeetings as we could on every subject from personal hygieneto the three signs of terminal malnutrition , we took our leave of the people of Yoakum and returned to Dallas . Eventually a column of these refugees did set out . Along the way they had lost about two thousand stragglers , with five thousanddead or unable to continue . Only six thousand people arrived in North Texas , of whom three thousand were placed in isolation due to their infectious disease status . All three thousand of these eventually died . Of the fifteen thousand people alive in Yoakum on the day we visited , approximately two thousand remain alive today .

Hillyer , Passion for War THE BUREAUCRAT 'S COLD EYEThe first test of my ability to get sensitive documents from official sources came immediately . Both Whitley and I wanted to have a selection of documents that had been produced in the months followingWarday . Most people were too busy dealing with blown out radios , televisions , and telephones , and trying to understand what had happened to us , to worry about bureaucrats and their pronouncements .

But the documents in those files can not be stolen , especially not the two collected here , which relate to the most fundamental of wartime experiences .

THIS ORDER TO TAKE EFFECT 1300 ZULU 15 MARCH 1989 . InterviewWilson T. Ackerman , Undersecretaryof Defense Wet . ) THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR . Wilson Ackerman is well known in Dallas , in the same way that somebody with an exotic contagion might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets , ask him questions . Sometimes , I suppose , they do more than that . Ackerman was aboard the Doomsday Plane on Warday . His testimony seemed essential , and he was available . The man is deeply afraid . His eyes never stop moving . AlthoughI do n't think he is more than forty-five , like so many of us he seems much older . His hands touch and caress his face as he talks , in a dry , quick voice that seems at times too precise , and at other times curiously rich . There is an almost lyrical terror in this man . It is an emotional state , perhaps , beyond guilt . I do not think it has a name . As Wilson Ackerman spoke in his careful tones I thought of a lover 's murmuring , and the quarrels of children , and the voices of the night . I did not know that we were in a war situation until the Secretary telephoned my office and told me in a brusque tone to activate Case Quick Angel . I then set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disperse upper echelons of the Executive BranchTHE WEST 55during a nuclear war . This order was given by me at exactly 1530 on 28 October 1988 . Shortly after that I joined the Secretary , as per plan , on the helicopterpad . We left the Pentagon via helicopter at once , heading for Andrews Air Force Base . With Secretary Forrest was Air Force General Potter Dawes , who was carrying the backup codes . We reached Andrews at 1545 hours and found that the White House contingent had already entered the E-4B aircraft . Under the Quick Angel basing protocols , the E-4B had recently been returned to Andrews from a base in Indiana . Donald Meecham informed us that the President was aboard and the National Emergency AirborneCommand Post ( NEACP ) was ready for takeoff . We then entered the aircraft and proceeded directly to the Presidentialsuite . The President greeted us and we sat down to a briefingfrom SAC General Joe Point . General Point indicated that there had been a Soviet response to the Space Shuttle 's deploymentof the first satellite in the Spiderweb warhead-killer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of SS-18 silos in central Siberia . Altogether they were preparing a launch of twelve missiles containing a total of fifty-four warheads in the 5- to 10-megaton range . At that time they had not launched any missiles . As our aircraft took off , we received telemetry from NORAD indicating that there had been an explosion , probably nuclear , in near space over the western Pacific Ocean . NASA then announced that the Space Shuttle had ceased to communicate with Houston due to this detonation , and had probably been destroyed . As the Spiderweb satellites were radiation hardened , the one deployed remained operational , but it was far from its intended orbit , and we now had no means to transport it . It was effectively useless , and in any case , formed only a small part of the total system . At that point the President decided that it was probable that we would soon be in a hot war . He therefore authorized Defense to transmit a War Warning to all U.S. military commands . I carried out that order at 1550 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Space Shuttle Enterprise was destroyed by a nuclear device of unknown origin at approximately 1545 hours U.S. Eastern Stan-58 WARDAYdard Time this day . It was engaged in a Defense Department mission . Please consider this a War Warning , and proceed to your designated alert level immediate . This caused SAC and the U.S. Navy Submarine Command to go to One Alert status , and the other services to respond by entering their highest states of readiness . It was at this point that war becameinevitable , but at the time there was still a sense of control in the NEACP . The President activated the hot line to Moscow . The telephone at their end was not answered . At last the President put the instrument down . " Gentlemen , " he said , " I am afraid that the Premier will not talk to me . " We then instructed Ambassador Underwoodin Moscow to call on the Premier at once and inform him that the United States was willing to negotiate a settlement of the question that had arisen between us . We further attempted communicationby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be out of order . There had been a massive failure on the part of Western intelligenceto correctly evaluate the Soviet response to the deployment of Spiderweb . This system , utilizing ultra-high-power laser beams , which targeted and destroyed warheads in space after they were ejected from their missile buses , was intended to render the United States invulnerable to land- or sea-based attacks . As the target acquisitionsystem was optical , the Soviet low-radar-profile systems were no defenses . We did not know at the time how far in advance of existing Soviet weaponry this system was , or deployment would have been evaluated differently . It was our stated intention before the deployment to begin dismantlingthe American offensive missile force once we were protected by the Spiderweb system . The Soviet leadership had given us no indication that they did not believe this , and had not even protestedthe deployment of Spiderweb . In retrospect it is obvious that they were so far behind technologicallythat they were afraid to so much as whisper a protest , lest their weakness become known to us . Although I was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am trying to come to grips with the fact that I was assisting in the management of a system of defense that had drifted into a THE WEST 67state of extreme brittleness , in the sense that our own technologicalsuperiority was making our enemy increasingly desperate , and thus was actually causing the very war it was intended to prevent . As per plan , the NEACP proceeded due south toward its intendedoperational area , approximately 100 miles SSW of the Cape Charles Lighthouse , over the Atlantic Ocean . At 1555 the National Security Agency informed us that three Soviet satellites had begun unusual orbital maneuvers . NSA said that these were designated as unusually large communications relaysatellites , and that there had been optical and electronic surveillanceconfirming this . However , this remarkable maneuver capabilitymade them highly suspect . The President then ordered SAC to destroy these satellites , utilizing the ground-based Slingshotmissiles , which are a classified weapons system . The Slingshotswere fired . Less than two minutes passed before the threatening satellites were destroyed . But it was too late . We were soon informed that they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an altitude level of 100,000 feet over California , Nebraska , Pennsylvania , and Manitoba . The President made a sighing sound , as if he had been struck in the chest . We all knew what terrific damage the country was soon going to sustain . It is far easier to create high-level electromagnetic energy in pulsed form than it is to shield against it . We were aware of the classified studies on this . We knew that a vast number of electronic circuits in the United States would be damaged , most of them beyond easy repair . Even those shielded to resist a 50,000-volt pulse would be destroyed by the explosion of such large bombs in near space , as the pulse each generated would far exceed 50,000 volts . At 1620 , we watched our entire fighter escort , consisting of six F-15s of the 113 TAC Group out of Andrews , corkscrew into the sea . The Soviet EMP weapons had just detonated . The fighters ' shielding had clearly proved insufficient , and these aircraft had undoubtedlylost their on-board computers , without which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the commercial airliners in the air over the United States and Canada began to crash or becamedangerously disabled . Approximately three hundred million radio and television sets , and most radio and television stations , 58 WARDAYceased to function . All microwave relay stations in the United States and Canada ceased to function , meaning that long-distance telephone and telemetric communications were no longer possible . The ignitions of many automobiles built after 1977  --  78 were renderedinoperable . Many local power systems failed due to fused relaysand subsequent overload . A staggering number of computers , and most of the automated factories used to manufacture them , were destroyed . Of course , repairs began at once , and some AM stations such as WOR in New York were on at low power within a week , but isolated cases of resiliency did little to ameliorate the overall effect of the pulse . Generally , the negative synergy of technologicalbreakdown and economic chaos has meant very slow recoveryfrom this damage . WOR , for example , ran for eight months , but was closed down when New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of ways , and the pilot soon informed us that he would prefer to return to an over-land situation . SAC called , using the still-functional UHF communications channel , which was designed to be proof against any level of EMP . The President then ordered Case Dream Eagle to be activated . At 1625.12 , six bomb-carrying satellites were armed to detonate automaticallyas they reached their target positions over the Soviet Union . To compensate for their greater state of EMP readiness , we generated an ambient voltage level of 120,000 volts with each bomb . This probably caused the destruction of ninety percent of all electronic devices in the USSR , as even their best shielding was not effective past 100,000 volts . Our own decision to limit protection to the 50,000-volt level had been the classic wargame mistake of assumingthat the other side would hit us with whatever maximum force we could conveniently defend against , and not with the maximumforce they could muster . We now went to our emergency communications systems , which consisted of the UHF channel to SAC , and an infrared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These were effectivedevices , and the NEACP maintained its essential communicationsdespite the enemy 's best efforts . CIA came on the laser communicator with an evaluation to the effect that the Soviets would release their SS-18s within three toTHE WEST 59five minutes . The President then opened the code boxes for Minutemanand unlocked the switches . I remember that Mr. Forrest put his hands over the President 's hands , because the President was shaking . The Defense Intelligence Agency then pulsed via UHF an analysisof the targeting of the Soviet weapons that had been rendered operational . While I was having this downloaded to screen for the President , he activated Minuteman . There were three flights containinga total of 56 warheads planned for the first wave . It was our intention to remove the Soviet government without excessive loss of life in the population . We intended to destroy Moscow , Leningrad , and Sevastopol , and hit the administrative capitals of all the republics . This would result in destruction of only eight percent of the population , but would cause the USSR to lose the means of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EMP damage had compromised the ability of the aircraft to maintaintrim , and it was now in a nose-low attitude , and was unable to maintain altitude indefinitely . We could expect to be on the ground , one way or another , within the half hour . At that time the President again tried the hot line . It was inoperative . An attempt to reach Mr. Underwood in Moscow failed . The President was informed that the British Prime Minister and the French President were both on the phone . The secret NATO Omninet communications system had also survived EMP . The President spoke briefly with each of them . The French Presidenttold him that he and the Germans and the British had informedthe Soviets of the existence of a secret treaty between the three nations , under which all American military installations in those countries were in the process of being entered by local nationals . The treaty had been designed to go into effect in the event that a nuclear exchange between the U.S. and the USSR occurred without the prior knowledge of NATO and France . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandonedus , or so it seemed then . I hope that the Treaty of Coventry proves to have been a wise one . If it had not been in place , the exchange of 28 October 1988 would undoubtedly have escalated into at least four more salvos , two of them against the NATO allies and80 WARDAYFrance . Inasmuch as the eventual damage done by the limited war we did have was so very much greater than we imagined , an exchangeon that scale would have rendered humankind a minor species , or perhaps an extinct one . The President begged the European leaders to inform the SovietPremier that we would in no case fire our missiles unless he first fired his , even at this late time . But the EMP exchange had caused them to lose contact with him . To this day his fate is not known . The DIA targeting analysis had been downloaded , and I briefed the President . The indications were appalling . Washington , D.C. , was going to receive a total load of sixty megatons . New York would get seventy . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is what actually did happen in Washington . The remainingmissiles were all targeted for Minuteman , SAC , and the USAF refit and supply center at Kelly Air Force Base in Texas . So the Soviet first wave was primarily a military targeting . Even so , we were going to take a serious population hit . Nearly twelve million Americans lived in target areas . It was now 1630 hours . I had an episode of angina pectoris at that time and was not present at the meeting with the NEACP Commander . When I returned to the Presidential suite , it was to find that the aircraft would have to land in fifteen minutes , and this landing would have to be accomplished on a beach off the coast of North Carolina , due to our inability to reach an airfield . If the NEACP was destroyed on landing , the United States would lose its ability to respond properlyto a Soviet attack . If this plane was forced to keep the command , we would have to fire Minuteman before crash landing , whether or not the Soviets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force us to use our missiles or risk their loss . The President then ordered NEACP transferred to the alternateaircraft , which was operating out of Offutt AFB in Nebraska . This aircraft reported severe EMP damage and refused the command . The President then attempted to raise HQ NORAD/ADCOMCombat Operations Center in the Cheyenne Mountain Complexand transfer to them , but this communication was not encodedproperly and was also refused . We could not find the properTHE WEST 61coding card , and to this day I wonder if the war could have been averted if we had found it . The President had a key to turn to fire Minuteman . He put his hand on this key and ordered the NEACP Commander to inform him when we were within one minute of touchdown . We commencedplacing the command to Cheyenne Mountain every ten seconds , hoping against hope that the transfer of authority would eventually be accepted . We attempted to relay the transfer via the alternate airborne command post , but there was no protocol establishedfor that , and the available chain of command did not have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to communicate with the Vice-President , but he was en route to the U.S. Government Emergency Command Control and CommunicationsCenter in Maryland , from which he was supposed to govern the country if the President became a casualty . We did not yet know that the EMP pulse had caused his helicopter to crash , with the loss of all aboard . It was agreed that Secretary Forrest would replace the Presidentat the key , should the President experience a physical problem in the next few minutes . Soon we began to see a long , narrow island below us . We were informed that this was our destination , and we would be landing not far from Kitty Hawk . The President ordered a check of the Minuteman communicationssystem , and the arming of the proper missiles . We were told by SAC that fourteen B-52s were holding at their fail-safe points despite EMP damage , and could proceed with their mission . They were ordered to do so . NSA then informed us that a suspicious satellite , also previouslythought to be a communications device , was ejecting devices over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Without a word , the President then turned the key and initiated the Minuteman firing sequence . The time was 1636.28 . At 1636.51 we received confirmation via UHF that the missiles were away . At 1637.06 Cheyenne Mountain told us that twenty-one nuclear deviceshad detonated in the missile fields in South Dakota . The Mountain then ceased to signal . The Soviet warheads had been fired from satellites . We had no knowledge of such weapons . AnB2WARDAYother few seconds and Minuteman would have been destroyed on the ground . Our alternative would then , as the Soviets well knew , have been to go to the city busters aboard our submarines and risk escalation to the destruction of our own population centers , or surrender . At that point the President had to be attended by his physician , due to difficulty breathing . At 1641.11 NORAD informed us that the Soviet SS-18s were launched from forward soils on the Kamchatka Peninsula . At 1642.40 we received a pulsed load showing the exact targets and throw times . Washington . San Antonio . New York . More for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omaha was not on the list . We were then told by the NEACP Commander to fasten our seatbelts , as the huge aircraft would be attempting a landing in the sand in two minutes . We left the command post and sat in the briefing room , where there were fewer sharp objects and access to the outside was quicker . We were given fire-resistant coveralls and breathing apparatus . A few minutes later the pilot began counting down from twenty . There was a sort of soft , surging sensation , then a stronger and stronger pull to the left , then the sound of equipment breaking far below as the belly of the aircraft was torn out . I left my seat , thinking that the plane had stopped , only to find myself hurled against the ceiling . I then fell amid a cascade of ceiling panels . I was in the aisle beside the President . I was covered with blood . I got to my feet and began trying to make my way down the aisle , which was full of plastic ceiling panels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began pouring out of nozzles in the front of the cabin . There was another abrupt shift of position and we were almost on our side . There was a strong smell of kerosene . I reached up and attempted to rouse the President . He was lollingagainst his seatbelt . Two airmen came in and began cutting him loose . Others led me and Mr. Forrest and the various other White House officials from the aircraft . Moments later we found ourselves in a hospital tent that had been inflated by the plane 's medical orderlies some yards from theTHE WEST 83aircraft , which lay on its side , its left wing bent and leaking kerosene , its right wing washed by the sea . The President was brought in just behind us and laid on a tarpaulin . When his face mask was removed , it was discovered that he was dead , from a broken neck . At 1654 we heard a long , crackling rumble from the north . I knew that this was the sound of the Soviet weapons detonating over Washington , two hundred miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the local volunteerfire department soon arrived . Zone of NowherePeople change when they see a Dead Zone . Once observed , a Dead Zone becomes a kind of personal secret , like a private disfigurement . There is something awesome and terrible about the sheer power it takes to create such destruction . It is impossible not to change when you have the first-hand experience of seeing a vast wasteland where a city of a million people once existed . One Dead Zone was San Antonio , the city where I was born and spent my youth and where my family lived before Warday . In 1990 I pulled enough strings with the military to be granted a flyover of San Antonio . After two years , radiation levels were sufficiently low to permit aircraft to approach the cratered areas without much danger . The U.S. Army  --  South Texas Military Area Command apparently makes such flyovers several times a week , sometimes for officials and foreign visitors , but also , I think , for a deeper reason . Even when the aircraft are empty of visitors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Entering a war zone  --  so called , I suppose , because it is a specialplace produced by war  --  is usually not possible overland . Radiationis only one problem ; navigating rubble and half-collapsed buildings is by far the greater difficulty . Only the centermost circleof the blast area is smooth  --  the result of the vaporizing effects of the explosion . YTHE WEST 85San Antonio is not going to be cleared . There is no need . No one wants to live there , and the potential for salvage is limited . Nonmilitaryvisitors are confined to helicopter flyovers . To take the tour , I had to travel to Austin and then down to San Marcos , which is a combined Army and Air Force installation . It is the command headquarters for the San Antonio War Zone . After half a day of having my paperwork processed , signing waivers of liability , and undergoing low-level interrogation about my journalistic interests , I was put on a jeep and driven to the flight line . I boarded a sixpassengerhelicopter with Army markings . My escort , the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had made the trip dozens of times before . He kept up a mostly one-sided chatter all the way to the zone : " You 're not goingto believe this place . It 's a symbol of immense , total power . And the bombs used were n't even the largest the Soviets could have used . " He sounded like a schoolkid reciting from memory . He made sure I was aware that no photographs were allowed . I knew that ; my camera had been impounded before we left . Why no pictures ? Certainly there were no secrets to be revealed . The extent of the damage was well known . But I could understand the restriction . There is a pornography associated with such wanton , total destruction . Since the war , a new terminology has emerged to describe the areas of nuclear destruction : Dead Zone , Red Zone , Orange Zone , Blue Zone , Green Zone . Painted signs , each with a skull at the center , reflect the varying levels of invisible death . What Army photographs the captain showed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high altitude and showed only a flat , empty San Antonio , devoid of detail . Emptiness says little . It is the remaining detail that reveals the devastation . Just ten miles out I noticed the first signs of the war : huge areasof rolling land devoid of any standing vegetation , blackened by what must have been a massive fire . Another few miles and there were collapsed heaps of charcoaled rubble , the remains of houses and barns that had stood in the rural areas outside the city . Then , to the right of the aircraft , we could see in the distance the uninhabitedtown of New Braunfels , a burned jumble of structures . The captain told me that former residents often tried to return and88 WARDAYresettle . They would go to the edges of the restricted zones and camp there , sometimes for months . I saw one such camp , a clutch of threadbare tents , and thought they are the people at the edge of the ocean . As we headed for the first Ground Zero , or GZ as my guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the helicopter . There were few buildings or houses left fully intact , though the contours of the land were varied enough to have made the destruction erratic . Closer to the center of the city there was only rubble . The downtownarea , which had consisted of twenty or so tall buildings , now looked like a forest that had been reduced to haggard stumps . For the first time the impact of a Dead Zone struck me : there was incomprehensible madness here . Scattered through the rubble were remote stations installed by the Army to monitor radiation and intruders . With their metal roofs painted bright orange , they looked like toys left by a child on a gray carpet . We quickly came up on the first of three GZ craters , which , even two years after the explosion , still shimmered in the sunlight from the fusion of soil , metal , concrete , and other melted materials . In the distance , perhaps eight miles away , we could see anotherGZ casting its own eerie dazzle . " You should see them at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 'll never forget the sight . " We circled around and around , but I could n't identify a single landmark . Where were the parks , the schools and universities , the shopping centers ? And what about the Alamo ? Though I stared out the window of the helicopter , I saw nothing . Instead , a flood of memories came back to me . I remembered summers in San Antonio , the backyard cookouts with my family and drive-in movies on warm evenings . I remember thinking as a child , as children do , that nothing would ever change and that my parents would live forever . Now I wondered what had happened to my bedroom , to the house I had lived in , to my old high school ? Were the students and teachers vaporized on Warday , or merely crushed by flying stone and metal ? What had happened to my family ? What had happened to Whitley 's ? My family and friends have stayed in my thoughts all theseTHE WEST 67years . I lost my mother and a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen more disappeared or were lost in the postwar migrations to safer parts of the country . My wife , Vivian , disappeared in the exodus from Austin . I have n't given up my beliefthat she is alive somewhere , looking for me , as I have been looking for her all these years . The fact that I had lost a home , a car , a career , and a thousand small possessions did n't even occur to me , especially as I looked at what was left of San Antonio . Instead , like most people in America , I thought of faces that were no longer there . And of family historiesand small treasures burned away . The landscape came back into view again . I could see the outlinesof shopping centers , portions of streets , and enough of a building here and there to guess that it had been a school or a church or a store . One large shopping center , at the edge of a blast area , was a flattened ruin surrounded by a vast field of congealed cars melted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to take notes or record impressions as I flew , but I just sat there . My silence seemed to disappoint the captain . Withoutrealizing it , he had begun to take a certain pride in the drama of his tour . He asked if I wanted to see more . " How about Kelly Air Force Base ? You can see the shadows of twenty B-52s and four C-5As on the runway . Really weird . " I shook my head . Back in San Marcos I was given a color enlargement of the San Antonio zone taken from three miles up . On the back in red letters was stamped , WARNING . NO PUBLICATION . There is n't much detail ; it is a dark gray moonscape . " Sorry it 's not from a lower altitude , " the captain apologized , " but at least you have a memento of your visit . " RumorsThe Road to AztlanJim and I are on a train between Dallas and Austin , passing through Waco . I remember Waco as a small , intense city in the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jay Westbrook lived there in the sixties , and the three of us used to be invited up for occasional weekends  --  usually after Jay 's mother had been to the apartment we all shared in Austin and had become concerned that we were too thin . The train rattles along at about forty-five . It 's clean , but pretty worn . Twelve Amtrak chair cars and a baggage car . There is no diner and no snack bar , and air conditioning is provided by keeping the front and rear doors of the cars open . The windows can not be opened , for these prewar cars were built with many assumptions that no longer hold true . The trip will take two hours and thirty minutes station to station , with four stops . Most of our fellow passengers are business people . The cotton industry in Waco is booming . With the collapse of cotton imports from Egypt and other countries , the local growers are finding their product much in demand .

TOM MULLIN : " I had a sister lived in El Paso and all of a sudden one day she turns up at our house in Waco with everything she owns in a shopping bag . She just got kicked out by the Mexicans , she says . And a lot of people were n't so lucky . They got hanged from street lights . And in Roswell  --  the Indians went in there and just about tore the place apart , the way I hear it . " JODY PICKEREL : " It 's probably not really a separate country from Mexico .

They 're in good shape down there , except for the money troubles and the food troubles and ... well , I take that back , they 're in bad shape . But that just makes them all the more dangerous . " CARLOS GONZALEZ : " I am on my way to Aztlan right now . You know what I am doing there ? I am selling clothes . That 's right , clothes I bought in Atlanta . I have them on this train .

You try to stay on I-20 down there the other side of Monahans , and them bandidos are goingto carve up your asses . That 's all I got to say about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McGregor , which serves as the stop for Waco . There is a lot of bustle , people getting off and on , men wearing weathered jeans and straw hats , carrying duffels full of possessions , people pushing carts loaded with baggage , children crying , voices rising in joy or sorrow at the partings and returns . About three-quarters of the passengers get out . We buy Cokes on the platform . We will eat out of our backpacks , to save money . Five minutes later the train is full again , with a few people sitting in the aisles . We pull out exactly on time . Like many of the other passengers , Jim and I have our homemade lunches . The train is due in Austin at 4:07 . It had better be on time , because our interview with Oliver Parker is scheduled for 4:30 . When the wind is from the south , I understand that the corrupt odor of San Antonio is sharp on the Austin air . InterviewOliver Parker , Governor of TexasYou know , Whitley , the fact is that some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a military structureright here in Texas . I 'm pushing a bill that will place the U.S. Third Army , the Twelfth Air Force , the state national guard , and the highway patrol under the overall authority of the governor 's office . I consider this the most important single thing I 've done so far in my administration . We are going to restore authority in the areas of Texas where there 's a problem . Especially down in South Texas . Those people have suffered enough . They 've really had it much worse than in most of the rest of the country , what with the destruction of San Antonio and the sickness and all . Plus there has been a tremendouslyhigh level of illegal immigration . All authority in Mexico has broken down . Without any significant oil income , with the collapseof trade and tourism , and our inability to export foodstuffs , I would n't be surprised if Mexico has n't experienced a greater populationdecline than we have . I 'd put it at forty to fifty percent in five years . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mexico City , and when we were suffering from the famine here , they were absolutely and totally destitute . They had no corn , no bread , no soy products , only their own beans . They lacked cooking oil . In Mexico City there was no potable water be-7172 WARDAYcause their U.S.-made sewage treatment system failed . Mexico City was hit as bad by dysentery and cholera as it was by the CincinnatiFlu . You had whole huge areas of the city where there was nobody left alive at all . If people wonder why in the world they 're still coming north in spite of what we 're going through , that 's the reason . You said you wanted me to say what I was doing on Warday . Well , I was in Dallas trying to get my campaign for the Senate together . I was going to get that seat from the Republicans . Mary was with me , and so was Elizabeth . The other kids were in San Antonio , I 'm sorry to say . After we 're finished , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our war baby , Oliver Junior . Perfect formation . He looks just like his mother . I do n't live in the Governor 's Mansion , by the way . The state does n't have the money to keep it up . We 're just barely staying solvent as it is , so I live in a raised ranch over on Red River . Maybe next year we 'll reopen the mansion . I deal with real basic issues : defense , disease , food , shelter , crime . I classify this whole Aztlan thing as a crime . As far as I 'm concerned they 're rebels , no different from the Confederates . I consider Texas a part of the United States , and Aztlan a part of Texas . If there 's ever a new Constitutional Convention , Texas will certainly be sending delegates . Other crimes we have , mainly , are crimes of desperation . There is still a lot of hunger . Real , raw hunger . Hell , people are dying of hunger and a lot of other things down in South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antonio is blighted . I guess you could consider that whole area depopulated . You know , from the roof of St. Edwards University south of here  --  you remember St. Edwards ? Well , from the roof you can see the start of the San Antonio Dead Zone . The horizon to the south is charcoal gray . And the sky is brown . It 's a weird sight . Like lookingacross to the surface of another planet . You remember my house in San Antonio , Whitley ? We finished that bathroom , and we were going to put in a pool . I was meeting with the Dallas County Democrats at the Ana-  --  tole Hotel when the war happened . The lights went out . That was because the EMP killed the hotel 's computer . As it died , it turnedTHE WEST 73off all the lights and sent the elevators to the lobby . I thought it was an internal thing . After a while we continued our meeting in the lobby , which is skylit . Mary came in with the news that there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked up and there was this American Airlines jet wobbling around . It kept banking first one way and then the other . Then we found out my brand-new Lincoln would n't start . I had a lunch scheduled at the Adolphus with Bob Rossiter of Rossiter Industries . We tried to phone him and found out the phones did n't work . I said to Mary , " Something big 's happened . " We tried to find a working TV . Could n't do it . We ended up walking all the way from the Anatole to the Adolphus , only to find that Rossiter was n't there . It was in the Adolphus lobby that we first heard the rumor that San Antonio had been bombed . Mary burst into tears . We held each other . We did n't know what to believe . Finally we went back to the Anatole . It was almost a year before we left Dallas . We lived with the Clint Rossiters , and I did legal work to pay our board . I 've been governor for three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Mark White announced that he was n't going to run for another term , Rossiter and the Dallas County Democrats got me to take it on . Mark 's not at all well . He flew over San Antonio three days after the war and got a hell of a dose . I did it too , last year , at three thousand feet . The way I look at it , that 's not a place anymore . It 's a hole in the world . One of our problems in Texas is that we have n't got the bankingtechnology available to run the state at a deficit . We 're limited to straight-line budgeting . I 've been thinking of issuing a Texas currency , but I do n't see the underlying assets to do it . I could peg it to the state 's proprietary oil holdings , but with oil at eleven cents a barrel , I would n't get very much out of it . And full faith and credit are n't going to wash , especially not overseas . Look at this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an engraving , done for us by an outfit in Lubbock . For a while we were dreaming of Texas currency . We 'd have bills denominated from a quarter to ten dollars . Sam Houston 's on the one , Austin 's on the two , Davy Crockett 's on the five . We have n't had the others made up , because Texas has n't got any underlying assets that would74 WARDAYsupport a currency , as I said . Texas got hurt so bad in the war , sometimes I 'm surprised that it 's still here at all , that everybody did n't just move . But we are still here . You travel around this state as much as I do , you 'd end up with a deep feeling of confidence and reverence . Texas is the land of the strong . People are working to rebuild . You know who really runs this state ? Volunteers . People see something that needs doing and they just do it . Fill a pothole . Pull down an abandoned house . You name it . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a volunteer . That project of mine , naming the dead  --  you must remember it , Jim , you wrote a thing about it in the Dallas paper  --  that was all volunteers . I know you did n't think it made sense , Jim , and maybe it did n't . But it means something to name the dead . I think it does . Here 's what they did . There 's over a million names in these books . Handwritten , every one . Over a million . San Antonio was so pretty . God , I remember when I had my Austin Healey and we were running the Archdiocesan Council of Catholic Youth , right ? We were a bunch . Who was that priest in charge of the thing ? Oh yeah , Martin . Father Edwin Martin . I remember him well . He always had high hopes for us . We put on some pretty good things , really . For a bunch of overheated intellectualswe did a good job . Is that thing running ? Lemme see it . Sanyo . You got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it . Two hours of recording on that ? It looks like a quarter . That 's amazing . Well , let me get back to business . You 'll have to edit this tape a little . Another thing we 're doing is working very intensively with some of the other states . California , Louisiana , Arkansas , Oklahoma , New Mexico , Arizona . We 're going to form a sort of loose coalition . California will lead it . That 's got to be . They 're ten times the size of Texas . You know that California is almost like the old days ? You been out there ? Well , it 's just beautiful . One thing , the Japanese are everywhere . And electronics are a good bit easier to get . I do n't think there 's any conspiracy to deprive America of electronicdevices , by the way . That 's a subject the Legislature 's been farting about an awful lot lately . They do n't want to debate AztIan . Do n't want to think about the rough stuff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I 'm going to have to get the Speaker to get the House off its ass on my military bill . Trask 's got the Senate wrapped up tight . No problems there . I need an army to go after Aztlan . Or they 'll come after us . I would n't be surprised at all to find them on their way to Midland-Odessa within a year if we do n't take some very damn decisive action . Anyway , getting back to the electronics . This thing is really beautiful . How big is it  --  let 's see  --  yeah , I could put two of these inside a cigarette pack . Three of ' em . Nice to see a Japanese thing like this again . Beautifully made . Running flat out , the Japs can build fourteen million televisions a year . If we bought ' em all , we 'd be back to prewar standards in about 2000 . But we ca n't afford the foreign exchange . We imported six million last year and made eight hundred thousand here in the States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those sets in Texas . That tells me we now have a million televisions in Texas . Here 's a piece of sweet news . Starting next July , we are going to be getting HBO via the new communications satellite California sent up from Vandenberg in June . And NBC is starting up again in the fall , broadcasting from Los Angeles . It 's going to be all reruns at first , but who the hell cares ? Maybe you ought to go back to writing , Whitley . Somebodytold me you 'd become a gardener . Well , I 'll bet you could make some money in television . A growth industry all over again . We 've got the Texas State Network , of course . I think the Hunt brothers bought two prints of every John Wayne picture ever made . I do a program once a week , " The Governor 's Desk . " I think people need to feel that the governor 's there . Without a President , the governors are that much more important . You know , the amazing thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've found that they are n't too interested in having a Presidential election . There just is n't all that much interest . Concerns telescope when people are having trouble . Somebody who has a sick kid or is facing cancer or NSD , or just living in these times , they do n't care about the Israelis slaughtering the Arabs or the South Africans marching into Zimbabwe or the Poles into the Ukraine . They 're indifferent to world affairs . And about all they remember of the U.S. is the flag and taxes . We still have the flag , so they figure the hell with the taxes. 76 WARDAYI just think one thing , though , and it 's the message I want to leave at the end of this tape . Aztlan is a serious problem , and the only way Texas can deal with it is by going in there and establishingstrict martial law . If we do n't , Aztlan will get stronger and stronger , and we 'll soon be facing an army . The Legislature has to act on my military bill . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onthe TriageMother , mother , I feel sick , Send for the doctor , quick , quick , quick . Doctor , doctor , shall I die ? Yes , my dear , and so shall I.  --  Skipping rhymeFROM THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROLThe most feared and controversial medical decision of this century has been the CDC 's triage recommendation . Both Whitley and I have been especially eager to include as much information about the triage as we can , since it affects American life so profoundly . I do n't have any really good sources at the CDC headquarters in Dallas , so I was very glad for our stopover in Austin . It gave me a chance to visit a friend who works for the CDC here , and who was willing to give me the kind of documents that would be useful . I wanted information that few people had seen before . I hit a vein of gold , as it turned out . My friend gave me the three documents reproduced here . For this I thank him and I guaranteehis anonymity . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three short memoranda than by any number of critically important medical discoveries . Because of these memos , millions of people have been denied even rudimentary medical care . But the triage has also guaranteed that those who can be helped are given what they need . During the flu , twenty percent of the population needed emergencyhelp . This occurred against a background of chaotic supply problems , high doctor mortality in affected areas , and a tremen-7778 WARDAYdous demand for drugs at a time when the industry was having trouble even maintaining normal production levels . Perhaps one in ten of the flu victims saw a doctor , one in a hundredentered a hospital . There is no way to tell if triage saves lives . Not only the triage , but so many other things that we now take for granted  --  home care for the dying , euthanasia , black market and alternate medicine , the British Relief  --  came about because the demand for care simply overwhelmed the nation 's medical system . The existence of the triage means different things to different people . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifedosewill creep up and I 'll find myself suddenly denied medicine for some small ailment that will therefore become large and finally kill . For Whitley , the triage means a shortened life . He can not legallyenter a hospital or consult a licensed physician . Like so many triaged people , he has learned a great deal of medicine . Doctors who ca n't treat a triaged person can and do organizeseminars for ten or twenty such individuals at a time . And then there are the underground medicals  --  the witches and the doctorswho practice illegally . And there is always the balance of hope . These three short memoranda seem innocent enough . But they are not innocent . They are the foundations of postwar American medicine .

Immediate burial and/or destruction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wherever possible , mass burial with suitable chemical agents is recommended . Civilian populations should be warned of disease potential . Triage procedures must be implemented to assist individualswith radiation-related injuries . First-degree thermal radiationburns , i.e. , " flash burns , " are likely to occur to exposed individuals within 30 miles of detonation point given estimated Soviet weapon yield of 9-10 Megatons . Second- and third-degree burns are likely in unprotected individuals in 15-25-mile range . Appropriate medical treatments should be as prescribedfor injuries of this type . Nuclear radiation injuries caused by gamma rays and neutronsare most serious , and high dosage can be life-terminating . Populations in two-mile radii from detonation points might have received 1,000+ rems . Critical level is 400-500 rams where radiationsymptoms are strongly evident and casualty rate is 50 percent or higher . Exposures below 200 are not believed lifethreateningand little treatment is recommended . Death rate at 1000+ is almost 100 percent . You are requested to provide every assistance possible to medical authorities to facilitate treatment of victims . Further triage instructions will follow . William T. Adcock , M.D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES/CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL/EMERGENCY TASK FORCE ON RADIATION INJURIESDATE : VOICE TRANSMISSION 15 JANUARY 1989 COURIER DELIVERY 16 JANUARY 1989SUBJECT : EMERGENCY MEMORANDUM ON ACUTE WHOLE-BODY RADIATION INJURIESYou are being provided herein with guidelines for the identificationof suspected radiation dosages based on readily observablephysical symptoms . These guidelines are intended for municipal and/or county representatives enlisted to screen civilianpopulations for subsequent medical treatment or attention . The severe drain on surviving medical facilities requires operating knowledge by all government personnel in order to directindividuals or groups to appropriate medical services . Most urban centers sufficiently distant from radioactive or zoned areas have created several " screening areas " to processincoming refugees and native citizens : Level One areas are for those with no apparent radiation symptoms ; Level Two areas are for those with limited hematopoietic or gastrointestinal symptoms ; Level Three areas are for highly traumatized and ataxicvictims . Some version of this system is urgently recommended to all municipalities . Refugee movement rates are still inordinatelyhigh and unpredictable ; virtually all communities in this region have reported high levels of influxing populations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiation injuries . You have been notified previouslyof emergency steps necessary to screen physical objects and food supplies for potential radioactivity . Because trained medical staff are limited and generally unavailableoutside of central medical facilities , it is imperativethat municipal staff , including police , fire department , civil servants , and temporaries , be aware of radiation-related illnesses . Because of many factors , but particularly because of proximity to bombed area and total radiation exposure , individualsmay or may not be viable candidates for medical treatment . THE WEST 81Large emergency treatment centers have been set up in key cities such as Lubbock , El Paso , Beaumont , Baton Rouge , Little Rock , Oklahoma City , New Orleans , and Albuquerque to treat individualswith medium to high levels of radiation dosages . Guidelines for treatment are under preparation and will be distributed to you as soon as available and approved by the Emergency War RecoveryAdministration . Guidelines to be employed by municipal authorities in screening war victims are as follows : LEVEL ONE SYMPTOMS : 0 to 100 REMSNo apparent symptoms in this range . Internal blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Care should be taken , however , to query all victims in order to determine point of origin , proximity to hit areas , and exposure to contaminated foodstuffs and objects from contaminated areas . LEVEL TWO SYMPTOMS : 100 to 200 REMSShort-term effects include fatigue and general malaise . Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea and vomiting on the first day . A two-week " latent period " may ensue in which symptoms disappear but then reappear in milder form . Generally , the more severe the symptoms in the beginning , the slower the process of recovery . Individuals with these levels of radiation dosages are excellent candidatesfor recovery . LEVEL THREE SYMPTOMS : 200 to 600 REMSIndividuals with dosages in this range can display symptomsranging from mild to severe . Nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , lack of appetite , etc. , are the most obvious characteristics . The more severe the symptoms , the higher the radiation dosage absorbed may be assumed . Again , there may be a latent period of a week or perhaps only several days . Higher dosages produce skin hemorrhages , bleeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above 300 rems , a loss of hair . A swelling of the throat is not uncommon . In the 600+ rem stage , high uncontrollable fe-82 WARDAYvers may be present , as well as emaciation . Death in these cases is probable in 80 to 100 percent of the cases ; judgmentsas to the extent of medical services to be provided are therefore advised . LEVEL FOUR SYMPTOMS : 600 to 1000+ REMSGastrointestinal symptoms are the most obvious : extreme vomiting , diarrhea , nausea , prostration , ataxia ( loss of motor control ) , and difficulty in breathing . Individuals displaying these symptoms will almost certainly die withinseveral days to two weeks . You are not likely to see individuals with such severe symptoms . All subjects arriving in a coma or comalike state should immediately be referred to medical authorities for handling . Undoubtedly , these guidelines are not complete , nor are they intended to be inflexible . However , the immediate need to process large numbers of incoming civilians is crucial in order to assure adequate distribution of medical supplies and attention , food and clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BY COURIER SIGNED RECEIPT MANDATORYTO ALL DIRECTORS , CIVILIAN AND MILITARY MEDICAL FACILITIES IN THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATESFROM U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES , CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL ( CDCHDQ ) ATLANTAREGARDING IMPLEMENTATION OF WAR EMERGENCY ACT AND EXECUTIVE ORDER 1510 FEBRUARY 1989Pursuant to the War Emergency Act ( 23 CFR 586 , Sections 18-35 ) and Executive Order 15 , you are hereby instructed to implement at once the emergency triage procedures necessary for the treatment of war victims . This action is taken in view of the catastrophicnumbers of victims requiring medical attention and the overall burden on existing facilities . The unavailability of adequate numbers of trained personnel and supplies , presently and for the immediate future , poses a major health hazard . The unprecedented nature of the emergency facing this nation mandatesthe immediate implementation of selection procedures for treatment . Communities can expect severe resistance , but you are reminded that the first task facing this nation is that of survival ; existing facilities , personnel , and supplies must be directed to those populations with the greatest probability of survival . Therefore , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructed to triage victims according to the following requirements : 1.0 GENERAL INJURIES ( Non-radiation-induced ) Mild to Severe : Injuries of this nature , such as burns , fractures , contusions , etc. , may be treated as conditions allow . Severe to Treatment should be limited toCritical : victims with greatest possibilities of recovery . Medical supplies should be limited accordingly. 84 WARDAYSeverely No treatment desirable . Critical : 2.0 RADIATION-INDUCED INJURIESTreatment should be accorded on the basis of radiation dosageabsorbed . Whole-body measurements should be taken whenever possible : in cases where this can not be done , interviewsshould attempt to ascertain proximity to radiationzones and duration of exposure . The following schedule should then be utilized : 0 to 101 REMS No treatment necessary. 100 to 200 REMS Treatment limited to radiationsymptoms such as flash burns , nausea , vomiting , etc . No other treatmentdesirable. 200 to 450 REMS Medical assistance most valuable here . At upper levels ( 350+ ) , chances . of recovery with medical attentionare 5111 percent. 450+ REMS No treatment desirable . It is not known at this time whether radiation injuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once or cumulatively . Your government is aware of the implications of this order . Steps are being taken by appropriate military authorities to provide assistance to you in implementation of triage instructions . You will be provided with further information as soon as it is available . You will be instructed as soon as possible regardingthe cessation of triage requirements . Signed : William T. Adcock , M.D. **31;13263;TOOLONG Espinoza , Aztlan LeaderENTRY INTO AZTLAN : RUMOR TO REALITY . Officially , Aztlan startsin Monahans . The actual border , however , was not encountered untilwe reached the former town of Van Horn , now called Ciudad de Reforma . The Texas &; Western Bus Company stops on this side of the big white gate that has been erected across I-20 . When we arrived at the border , we found that we were expected . Governor Parker had sent a special message to the Foreign Minister of Aztlan , apparentlyright after our interview . Despite the differences between Texas and the new country , this letter smoothed our passage and enabled us to gain access to the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital , we found that the real power in the country is centered around the Foreign Minister , who has obtained recognition from most of Latin America , Spain , and a number of African countries . Even more important , he has obtained much friendly help from Japan . There is no reason , really , to introduce Senor Espinoza . He speaks very well for himself . We in Aztlan have created a new nation , stretching from Texas to the California border . There is a constitution , and a national government , the only one presently active in the former United States. 8688 WARDAYAztlan is recognized by many countries . We have here in El Paso ambassadors from Mexico , Brazil , Chile , Paraguay , Nicaragua , El Salvador , Guatemala , Cuba , and Japan . Many other nations are favorablyinclined toward Aztlan . We have received an agriculturalteam from the People 's Republic of China . Great Britain is providingmedical help . Officially , Britain , France , and Germany have not recognized Aztlan . But we are confident that they will one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official language is Spanish . This must be understood . As U.S. citizens , you have the right to enter and leave without showing a passport , but you do not have the right to vote in our elections , or remain here more than thirty days without a visa . We have an army of four divisions , nearly forty thousand men . We have a national police force , which is why , when you crossed the border , there were suddenly no more bandits on the roads . Also , the Japanese have sent road-repair teams to Aztlan , so we have no more potholes in our interstates . And Japanese medicine has kept our disease rate low . We have not been affected by fallout . In fact , we drew the border through Fort Stockton rather than including San Angelo and San Antonio , because of the destruction and the radiation . You must understand that , as a new nation , Aztlan has had its share of growing pains . We have had to relocate many Anglos across the border in Texas , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable when a new nation is formed . Aztlan is a strong , civilized , and free country . We have no politicalprisoners in our prisons , and nobody has ever been tortured in Aztlan . We do have a policy of encouraging Hispanic and Indian settlement of the territory . We are very frank about that . For five generations this land belonged to the Anglos , and look at the result . For ten generations before that it was Hispanic land , and beforethat , Indian for twenty generations . We practice the same sort of enlightened socialism that is found in progressive countries across the world . We follow the Chineseexample to some extent , but we also guarantee personal freedomas the Swedes do . And we do not keep people in prisonTHE WEST 87because of their political views . There are many cooperative concernsin Aztlan , farms and factories and power establishments . When a farmer sells his holdings to the cooperative , he gets in returnlifetime free medical care with no triage , an income based on his production capabilities , and the support that comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranch system . The Japanese have provided us with millions of dollars ' worth of advanced trickle-irrigation equipment , so we have been able to add many thousands of acres to the area cultivated in Aztlan . This acreage is planted with soybeans , which has become our largest export crop . We also sell oil and peanuts and wheat and corn and , of course , beef . Aztlan is a prosperous country . There is no unemploymenthere . If you want to work , you can work . If you do n't want to work , you can go to Texas or California . Officially , both of those states are part of Aztlan . But we do not want the part of Texas we do n't already have , and we would have to fight a war to get California . We are not yet prepared to do that . If we were ever to gain California , Aztlan would become one of the most powerful countries in the world . Not a superpower  --  we do n't want that . But a great power , perhaps as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we gave foreign aid last year ? Can you imagineit ? We sent five hundred thousand bushels of soybeans and two hundred thousand of corn to Mexico . Of course , you know that they are all dying down there . Officially , the border between Aztlanand Mexico is open . And in the past three years , perhaps a millionimmigrants have come here . Now we have an agreement with Mexico . They get our food aid , and in return they process all potentialemigrants to Aztlan . Since we can not take the sick and they will not let the able-bodied leave , the immigration from Mexico is presently very small . If they wish to enter North America , the Mexicans must cross the Rio Grande into Texas , not Aztlan . I am myself the Foreign Minister and official spokesman for Aztlan . We have a full portfolio of ministers . Our present capital is the Marriott here in El Paso . It has been renamed La Capitola , and contains our administrative apparatus . Our government is not or-88 WARDAYganized around a president or prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the party that gets a simple majority forms the governing committee for the next four years . We have the State Socialists and the Social Democrats . The SD is part of the International Social Democratic Movement , and is the less radical of the two parties , as they believe that private ownershipof national industries , such as power and transport , should be allowed . At the present time , my party , the State Socialists , is in power . We believe in cooperatives but not in central planning . We do not want to repeat the disastrous mistakes of the Soviet Union and create a repressive and counterproductive bureaucracy . So we are not a rigidly planned community . Our socialism is strictly voluntary . If you join , you get the benefits of cooperative living . If not , then you go it alone , but nobody interferes with you . And the coopscompete with one another in a free macromarket . Each co-op is autonomous . In soy farming , for example , there are sixty co-ops and fifty-one private farms , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and eight by Japanese firms . The co-ops have an association that sets prices and provides a system of mutual assistance . Thus they are much more efficient than the private farms . We have our own currency . The Far Eastern Bank Note Companyin Hong Kong makes the notes . They are backed by an equivalentamount in Japanese yen . Of course , this makes the currency very valuable , as it is exchangeable at any bank in the world for yen . Ten Aztlan pesos to a thousand yen . Better than the dollar ! Our economy enjoys a balanced current account , which means that our exports pay for our imports . We have no inflation , as all prices are controlled . There is no hunger in Aztlan . And there is racialequality . Even Anglos , if they want to stay , are welcomed into the community of the Aztlan people ! Our Indian population is free to live and worship as it pleases . We have Hopi , Apache , Pueblo , and Navajo tribes living in Aztlan . Their tribal areas are self-governing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor do we have any sort of Bureau of Indian Affairs . We just let them do as they please in their own territories . THE WEST 89But , unfortunately , we can not grant you safe conduct into the Indianlands . Among the Indians there is , frankly , a good deal of hostilitytoward Anglos . Now I suppose I ought to talk about what happened at Roswell , because you 've probably heard about it from others . You must understand that we view the Mescalero Apaches as a separate , sovereignnation within Aztlan , and Roswell is within the boundaries of their tribal state . They took over the town about six months after the war , as soon as it became clear that the central government had collapsed . When we declared Aztlan in 1989 , we went to the Mescalero , they did not come to us . All I can tell you is that the incident was overblown . Those Anglos who were killed had formed an armed resistance movement . People were not tortured or burned . And nothing like a thousand were killed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that number . And there were trials , you understand . The whole process took months . All of it was before Aztlan . If it happened now , we would try hard to persuade the Indians to let the Anglos leave Indian lands peacefully . I am glad you suggest that this book will be distributed in England . We have to get an awareness among the British people that Aztlan exists . British recognition would confirm us as a permanent nation , and a British guarantee of sovereignty would mean that our chief worry of war with California or Texas would never come true . If we had such a guarantee , even a reconstructed United States would have to think very carefully about invading us or destroyingthis serene and happy nation . The territory we call Aztlan was originally part of the Spanish Empire and the Republic of Mexico . You must remember that Mexico was then a perfectly ordinary nineteenth-century republic , no more or less violent or repressive than the United States . But the United States first encouraged Anglo colonization of Texas and California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Battle of San Jacinto in 1836 , less than onethirdof the population of Texas was Anglo . And California was simply stolen . Mexico was forced to accede to the Treaty of GuadalupeHidalgo in 1848 and give California to the United States . It was theft ! 90 WARDAYAs a result of the loss of its territory north of the Rio Grande , Mexico was emasculated and her people lost their sense of personalpride . The image of the lazy " Meskin " and the " Frito Bandido " was born , but it was not laziness , it was sorrow . We Hispanics are not lazy and we are not bandidos and we are not stupid . If we are so stupid , how come we have the only happy , safe , and well-organizednation north of the Rio Grande ? While the Anglos fight bitterlyamong themselves for the rancid bits of the old United States , we Hispanics have quietly created this beautiful country , this beloved Aztlan ! We even have our own poets , our own writers , our own film stars . Chito Hernandez , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names of which you know nothing . But they are our stars ! We make ten films a year in Aztlan , and when you combine those with the ten made in Mexico and the twenty in Spain , you have a new Hispanic movie almost every week . And we have a television and radio industry . The Japanese sell us more radios than we can possiblyuse . They put up a new station right here in El Paso . Radio " A , " it is called . We also have Japanese cars and a new Japanese train running on the Santa Fe tracks from Monahans all the way to Tucson , where it connects not only with the Sunset Limited but with the El Costero , which provides super-express service down the Pacific coast of Mexico . We are on the world map , I assure you . People want our soybeans and other farm goods , not to mention our oil and gas and uranium , even coal . For many people in the old United States , the confusion that resultedfrom the obliteration of Washington was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aztlan , it was really almost a blessing . Of course , we are very sorry for all the death and suffering . But Warday also brought some good  --  our Aztlan . I do not want to lie to you , though , nor seem too bombastic . I suppose I ca n't help it . I 'm a natural enthusiast , and I 'm excited by what we 're accomplishing here . Still , the way has not been as easy as all that . And Aztlan is far from perfect . You might find things wrong here . But you will also find love and a powerful sense of community . This is the great Chicano state , this Aztlan , and I loveTHE WEST 91it so much that sometimes it hurts my heart , you know , when things are not as I would wish . We have to rely a great deal on the Japanese , and they are certainlyexploiting us . But we have the brotherhood and sisterhood of our nation , and our great heritage . I trust our isolated little country to survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Espinoza is afraid for his infant state , and so tries to hide its weakness behind bold words . But Espinoza does not know his own people . Whatever happens to Aztlan , the eager confidence of its citizens will not be utterly lost . They have created something new here , and it will have its effect . Obviously there have been excesses . There are no Anglo faces in the streets . The Mobil refinery that one sees on the way into town is closed . There are many Japanesesoldiers about . Although we were not allowed to visit Fort Bliss , Jim and I both had the impression that it is now a Japanese enclave . No doubt they intend to protect the vast soya plantations that have sprung up in the desert , which must be providing essentialfoodstuffs to their homeland . But these facts tell nothing of the feeling of this new El Paso . The streets are no more full of cars than Dallas or Austin , perhaps even less so . Yellow schoolbuses have been dragooned for street service . Each bus is apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , all are decorated differently , painted with flowers and slogans , loudspeakers blaring the music of Radio " A " from their roofs . We have been billeted at the Granada Royale on I-10 , newly named Paseo de la Revoluci6n . The hotel is a delight . Its large rooms surround an atrium garden full of flowers . There is an inTHEWEST 93door-outdoor pool . The atmosphere is quiet and unhurried . Most of the other guests are Japanese , some of them obviously long-term residents . It is strange to hear somebody speaking Spanish with a thick Japanese accent . We were served breakfast in our suite and spent the next hour trying to arrange a tour of the city . First we used the old Yellow Pages to call Hertz , Avis , and the local car rental agencies . Hertz , now called Autocars Liberidad , was open . They were taking reservations for November . As this was August , we decided to give up on car rental . There are no longer conventional taxis in El Paso . By law , they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smaller thoroughfares , essentially supplementing the buses . Our last option was to take a bus tour , but we soon found that both Gray Line and Golden Tours were booked for the day , or claimed to be . Perhaps somebody did n't want us to tour the city . We ended up spending the morning in the hotel . I observed the city from the rooftop restaurant , which commands a fine view of the whole area . I saw no planes take off from the airport , which is not far away . Here and there I could see sooty scars on a building , but beyond that there were no obvious signs of the revolution . SenorEspinoza appeared just before noon , his thin body swallowed by a seersucker suit . He was full of brightness and what I can only describe as punch . As soon as we saw him , we requested a tour of El Paso . He said that he would suggest something even better : we should have lunch with him . We could always see the town later , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liberal application of governmental authority , gotten us precious tickets on a " Super Express " bus that left for Las Cruces at three . Tickets on another could not be guaranteed for weeks . It was becoming clear that we were not intended to make any detailed reconnaissance of this community . Senor Espinoza was , in effect , throwing us out of his country . Given his position of power , we decided to let him do exactly as he pleased . We were left to swallow our questions about such things as the condition of hospitals and prisons , and what was happening to the homes and property of the Anglos . The Isabella penthouse restaurant in the Granada is now called94 WARDAYCasa del Sol Norte . The food is Tex-Mex , what Senor Espinoza described as " superb Aztlan cuisine . " Actually , his hyperbole was in this case not far from the truth . I used to enjoy Mi Tierra and La Fonda in San Antonio , and Casa Rio on the river . I can also recall going to this restaurant 's namesake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York , I sought good Mexican food constantly , but what I found only increased my hunger for flavors like these . I will repeat the menu in detail . We had cheese enchiladas , cabritochili , chicken tacos , rice , and refried beans . The tacos were generously garnished with tomatoes , lettuce , and onions , and the seasonings were uniformly excellent . We drank Carta Blanca beer from Mexico . The menu showed that the meal was five pesos " A " to privatos , two pesos to comunistas . After lunch , we were not too surprised to find we had barely enough time to get to the bus . Senor Espinoza claimed to have forgotten the time and left , pleading an urgent appointment . We soon found out the reason for the abrupt departure . Without the use of a private car , we were going to have to struggle to get to the stationon time . Neither of us wanted to find out what would happen if we missed our connection . Jim stood beside me outside the hotel as we waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aztlan had saddened him , because it seemed to him a failure of the racial harmony that had been growingin Texas before the war , and yet another doomed ideological attempt to alter blood and land with words . I felt much better about it . There was energy and optimism there , and the powerful spirit of cooperation was something that we would do well to import into the United States . I suspected that Aztlan was going to work , though not in the way foreseen by SeEspinoza , nor in the way feared by Governor Parker . That beehiveof little cooperative enterprises was going to grow , spreading its new economic ideas in all directions . I also suspected that Senor Espinoza 's caution was not based so much on a desire to hide his problems as it was on a fear that we might be spies for Governor Parker . After all , a letter from Parker preceded us here , probably by just a few hours . Espinoza was terrifiedof Parker , and probably also of us . Before I went to Aztlan , the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand and vast , spiritless Soviet communes on the other . I was not prepared to meet such a strange new economy as the one we found : thousands of tiny co-ops , each dependent solely upon its own success to pay its members , none larger than the smallest economic unit necessary to perform its particular function . This means that the motel where we stayed , for example , was run by two separate co-ops , the restaurant workers and the hotel staff . The state does not pay them , nor does it plan for them . They keep their own books and split their profits weekly . If there are no profits , nobody gets paid that week . A brightly painted schoolbus jammed with people finally came down Paseo de la RevoluciOn . Radio " A " got louder as the bus got closer . Buses are supposed to stop whenever somebody hails them  --  there are no fixed stops in El Paso . But this one passed us by . It was full . As we watched one jammed bus after another pass us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purple Super Express tickets Senor Espinoza had given us were valueless if we could n't make it to the bus station . Finally a half-full peseta came along . We were almost surprised to see it stop when we hailed it . The fare is ten centavos " A " for holders of yellow co-op cards , which most people wear pinned to their shirts and blouses . These cards identify their bearers as part of Aztlan 's network of cooperatives . Capitalists must pay one peso " A " to ride . We paid our pesos happily . I got in the front seat of the massive old Buick station wagon , repainted many times , now the bright red of the flag of Aztlan . In fact , Aztlan 's red flag with the gold radiant sun in the center snapped from both front fenders and the radio antenna . Jim was jammed in the back with three other people , all wearing yellow cards . " EstaciOn de la autobicses del norte , por favor , " I said . My Spanish is less than minimal . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these impressionsof El Paso : The cemetery beneath the complex tangle of the Spaghetti Bowl where I-10 intersects the Expressway is in prewar condition . Unlike the situation common in Dallas , new graves have not been96 WARDAYdug in among the old . But there are many empty buildings , empty houses , and abandoned cars . Just before we turned onto Piedras , we saw along the side of I-10 the glittering aluminum ruins of a jet , cracked plastic windows in the few bits of intact fuselage , the plane 's markings no longer readable . Japanese soldiers passed us in squat Toyota military vehicles . Their light khaki uniforms were spotless , the Rising Sun on their shoulders . As they rode along they shot pictures of the distant Franklin Mountains with Minoltas as small and thin as credit cards . Earlier we had noticed a restaurant with the odd name " Gunther 's Lotus Blossom . " A closer look revealed that the sign had once read " Gunther 's Edelweiss . " Before Warday , the U.S. Army used to train soldiers of the German Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road from here . We wondered if Gunther was still around , or if he had left only his name behind . Japanese military planes flew low overhead . They were oddlookingthings , with their wings canted forward instead of swept back , so that they appeared to be flying backwards . Instead of a jet 's familiar scream , they made a low drumming noise that seemed almost to thump your chest . I recall the strange cant of the wings from NASA designs for future hypersonic aircraft . We had ridden in silence for some time when the driver decided to try striking up a conversation . " Hey , gringo , " he said with a big smile . " Let 's talk norteamericano ! See if I can still do it ! " His name was Carlos Leon , and he was from San Antonio . " I 'm from there too , " I said . " So is he . " I nodded toward Jim . " Hey ! Compadres ! I grew up there . Left in ' 86 to get a job out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were lots of jobs here again . I was managing a McDonald 's . Kept at it , too , until the meat stopped getting delivered . Then I said the hell with the franchise , sold the equipment , and signed up as a cooperator . They assigned me to pesetas and gave me a permit to buy a station wagon . Our co-op consists of me , my wife the bookkeeper , and my cousin the mechanic . " " Where did you live in San Antonio ? " " West Side ! I lived on South Zarzamora . My dad was a garbage man  --  but not in his own neighborhood ! We had to take our garTHEWEST 97bage to the dump ourselves until the fifties . My mom and dad died in San Antonio . " " I lived in Terrell Hills , " I said . " Rich , eh ? " " My dad was an oilman . " " Oh boy ! You 're poor now , eh ? I see you work with your hands ! " " I 'm poor now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you ! Join the rest of the world . " I laugh . " No more oilmen . " " Hey , that 's good . No more oilmen ! Just British and Israeli oil import agents , right ? " I did not mention that Texas oil was flowing again , and that refinerieswere opening up all over the United States . There was a razor edge of anger among these people . This was their place , their time at last , and these their days of sunshine . Walls pockmarked with bullet holes were a common sight as we neared the center of town . " Jim and I went to Central , " I said , hoping Carlos might also be an alumnus . This is not as unlikely as it sounds : Central Catholic had a substantial Hispanic population when we attended . The sudden silence tells me that my suspicion is correct . Carlos stops the car . " Well , goddamn . " " Brother Halaby ? " " Shit , yeah ! " " Brother Arafia ? " " The Spider ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Spider taught world history and his real name was Brother Gordon , but his thin , six-foot-four frame gained him the nickname Brother Arafla . So total was his identification with us that he was known to get mean when freshmen called him Brother Gordon . " I 'm Brother Arafia , " he would snarl , " and do n't you forget it . " Carlos had been five years ahead of us at Central . " You rememberBrother DeLoach ? " he asked . " He was principal our freshman year . He retired . " " He taught me a hell of a lot . I was a real bad kid when I went there . Angry , you know ? And so damn stupid . I 'd been a year at98 WARDAYSouthton already ! They hit me with a razor strap there . I was down for selling grass . Shining shoes and dealing grass to the soldiers on Alamo Plaza , then going to the Alameda to see Cantinflas movies . You know what we got for a joint  --  we called them Mary Janes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they cost us eighty-five cents apiece . So we were risking years of freedom for fifteen cents ! Sure enough , the next thing I knew I was down for a year and my mom and dad were thinking they had raised a rotten kid . When I got out I applied to Central . No way I 'm gon na get in , my parents figure . I 'm fourteen and already a jailbird . But DeLoach , he lets me in . You stay away from the Mary Janes or I 'll paddle your behind , ' he says . You 're a smart kid , that 's your problem . We 'll give you a little something to do with your mind , you 'll stay out of trouble . ' " " Did it work ? " " I loved that school ! One of these days I 'm gon na go back . I 'm gon na see  --  " Silence . We are suddenly very still , we alumni . Night has just touched us in the middle of the afternoon . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the station , and the newsstand carried papers with names like Revolution and Viva Aztlan ! There were also Mexican and Spanish papers , El Diario and La Nota . The Japanese Asahi Shimbun en Espanol was prominently displayed , as was the London Times  --  in English , of course . I would have bought a copy , but it cost the equivalent of three dollars . Jim was delighted to find that the candy counter was well stocked . Last year , M &Ms; and Hershey bars reappeared in Dallas , but here in El Paso you can get all manner of colorful locally made confections as well . We stocked up on fresh pralines and other indigenoussweets in the fifteen minutes we had before the bus left . It was a brand-new Japanese Hino , very comfortably appointed and efficiently air conditioned . In El Paso in August this is a definiteplus . It was about ninety degrees , and would probably be a hundred before the end of the day . The driver was wearing a spiffy green uniform . He carried a .38 in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prepared for the onehourjourney to Las Cruces and the border . In the bus around us were well-dressed travelers , the men in light summer suits and dark glasses , some of the women even in silk dresses . These peoplee9100 WARDAYwere Aztlan 's elite . Apparently the common folk go to Las Cruces in something other than Super Express buses , if they go at all . Across the aisle from me sat a man in a magnificent suit , perhapseven a Savile Row creation . Beside him , his wife was wearing a designer dress of light blue silk . I tried to engage them in conversation , but they turned to each other and began to speak animatedlytogether . The bus was soon on its way up the long , straight road to Las Cruces . There were trucks on the highway , many of them filled with farm produce . Sometimes we saw cars too , mostly the Toyota and Nissan limousines that are the modern hallmark of the Japanesebusinessman . A Chevy Consensus or two passed , and the usualsparse collection of prewar jalopies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south of the town of La Mesa , when the bus slowed and turned off the interstate . " La Mesa , " the driver called , and a couple of passengers began to take their baggage down from the overhead racks . All along the roadside into town , there were makeshift dwellings . DerelictGM buses with Sun City Area Transit ( SCAT ) markings had been made over into shelters . There were tents and even geodesic domes . I saw some blond children toddling about , and an Anglo woman working on a truck . Anglos in Aztlan ? Jim and I agreed at once : we would interrupt our trip in La Mesa . We 'd take potluck on the final miles into Las Cruces and just hope the nervous Senor Espinoza was n't having us followed . We got out at the brand-new La Mesa bus station and began walking back along the highway . A clump of Japanese in white coveralls came out of a restaurant and watched us for a time . " Momento , por favor , " one of them called at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , please . " We stopped . " You are  --  tourists ? " " We 're writers . Doing research for a book about America . " " Ah ! " Bright smiles . " You write about us ? " Even brighter smiles . " What do you do ? " THE WEST 101The smiles become fixed . " We agricultural specialists . " " Helping out with the soya plantations , eh ? " " That 's right . This is soya country ! " They let us walk on . When we passed the outskirts of La Mesa , it became obvious that there were no soya plantations in this area . You could see all the way to the Portrillos across the desert . " They were uranium workers , " Jim said quietly . " You 're sure ? " " Those pouches at their waists  --  you saw them ? " " Yeah . " " They contained face masks . I 've seen people wearing them at Los Alamos . And those blue plastic strips on their collars . If they get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked back into the quiet town . The bus was long gone , and there was n't a car in the street . In the distance , a motor rumbled . Cicadas screamed in the trees . We caused an even greater stir in the tent community than we had among the Japanese . People began shouting , then running , and in a few minutes at least seventy or eighty had gathered along the roadside . A young woman came forward . She had an enormous .357 Magnum strapped to her belt . She was perhaps twenty-five , tall and sleek , her face weathered , her hands red from hard work . One hand rested firmly on the pistol . " May we help you ? " she asked . Her accent was familiar , the broad twang of West Texas . " Jim spoke , his eyes on the gun . " We 're writing a book about postwar America . We 'd like to talk to you , if you do n't mind . " " Where you from ? " a man asked from the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to California . " Surprisingly , this revelation caused general laughter . " You got entry permits ? " Jim frowned . " We 're writers . Surely they 'll let us in . " " Hey , " the man shouted , " y'all hear that ? All we got ta do is go up to the Yuma P.O.E. and say we 're writers . We 're in ! " This was not a friendly crowd . But I felt sure they had a story . " Could we buy some supper ? " I asked . The girl with the Magnum nodded . " You got pesos A ' ? " 102 WARDAY " Five . Will that do it ? " " Ought to , if you like rice . That 's what we got . Rice and soybeansoup . " The group began to disperse back into the camp . The girl , our guard , stayed close . Her hand remained firmly planted on the pistol . She had a soft , open face , but the way she held her lips told me that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close , the camp was a hodgepodge . There were L.L. Bean tents arranged with old cars to make shelters , the buses we had seen from the highway , trailers , and even a few portable buildings . Why , in a nation of empty housing developments and abandonedapartment buildings , anybody would be living like this was beyond me . " You do n't have homes ? " " No , we do n't have homes . " " Go to Dallas . You can take over a couple of neighborhoods . " She snorted , tossed her head . " We 're on the wanted list in Texas . Do n't you ever go to the post office ? " " A lot of wanted posters at the post office . I never saw one with your face on it . " " It 's there . " I was afraid to ask why . Jim sat in the dust , very quiet , his eyes sharp . He did not speak . " We 're robbers , " the girl said . " Espinoza let us stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highway patrol . " " Robbers ? " " We live by our wits , " an older woman said . " You 've heard of the Destructuralist Movement ? " I had indeed . They believed that there should be no social structurebeyond the extended family . Even tribes were too much for them . " Destructuralists tried to burn the Dallas Civic Center . " " That was us , " the girl said simply . No wonder they had left Texas . " People were outraged . " " People are addicted to social structure . Warday has given us a historic opportunity to break the boundaries of social control . To be free . " " We ca n't rebuild the economy without social structure , " Jim said . THE WEST 103The faces around him went hard . I wondered if we might not be arguing for our lives here . I hoped that he realized it . " We do n't need the damn economy , " a man said , his voice full of bitter sarcasm . " The economy 's worse than an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dying because the economy 's in such a mess , " I said . " At the rate of two hundred and fifty thousand a month , to be exact . That 's about eight thousand a day . Nearly a hundred just since we started this conversation . " " You 're real smart , " the girl said . " I 'm a human being . I love other human beings . " " People are dying because nature is rebalancing the earth 's ecology . " " They 're dying because of Warday . " Another voice intervened : " Rice 's ready ! " This was a lean young man with bright gray eyes and a dusting of beard . People lined up before a big stainless-steel pot . They carried their own utensils . Each was given a smallish serving of rice topped with cooked soybeans . I thought of my lunch with Hector Espinoza . In fact , I longed for it . I still do . I would give a lot for another taco as crunchy and perfectly seasoned as that one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hot . The rice and soybeans were a pitiful meal . It reminded me of the famine , and made me feel frightened . The sun was making long shadows when we were finished . I sensed that Jim was as eager as I to get away from this place . When I die , I want to be given the grace to go for a good reason . I did n't wafit to die to serve the frustrations of some very unhappy and confused people . " We have a vision , " the girl said , " of a true Jeffersonian societyin America . This could be a nation of farmers , where everybody is self-sufficient and God-fearing , and the family is the center of things . " Her voice rose . " I had a family , you guys ! I had a little girl . She was taken from me by heathens . She was taken for no good reason , and she was killed out in the backyard by people who had decided that my family no longer belonged in Roswell , New Mexico . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She turned and kissed him in what seemed to me a private way . " We all lost people , " he said . " That 's why we come together . This is a family . " 104 WARDAYAnother voice was raised . " If you 're writers , write that another world like the world we had before Warday is going to mean anotherwar . We have to change . We have to turn aside from the hypnosisof politics and the addiction of vast economic systems that eat this beautiful planet and spit out garbage . We need to turn to one another instead . What counts is the person in bed beside you , and your children , and the people next door . The rest is all addiction and hypnosis and more Wardays . " My impulse was to try to comfort them , to make all the horror and the suffering of the past few years go away . But I could n't do that . All I could do was eat their poor meal and look across their fire at them . The girl with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " here 's what 's gon na happen . " She nodded at Jim . " You 're gon na go wherever you 're goin ' . But you are n't sending anybody after us , like from Texas . " She put her free hand on my shoulder . " You 're stayin ' here for a while , just to make sure he does n't send anybody . " I felt the blood drain out of my face . I really did not care to end up trapped in the worst place we had thus far encountered . What would they do with me ? Lock me up in one of those stifling , filthy , derelict buses ? " Three months , " Jim said . " Six . " " Let him go in three months . If you do n't , I 'll assume he 's dead and tell the Texas police where to find you . " " Four months . " " Four . " With that , Jim got up . I was appalled . Apparently he proposed to just leave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this bunch . " I 'm triaged , " I shouted . " I gave up precious time with my own family for the book we 're writing . You ca n't take even more of my time , not if you love the family the way you say you do . " " We did n't invite you here . " Jim turned without a word and walked to the road . He soon disappeared toward La Mesa . At that moment I hated him . I screamed after him . I flung my empty plate at his departing shadow . THE WEST 105 " You 're lucky it did n't break , " the girl said . " You 'd have to figureout how to mend it . And we do n't have a lot of glue . " A great woe overcame me . I was facing four pointlessly wasted months . " I swear to you , I 'll keep your secret . " " The Texans would kill us . " " I 'm not even going in that direction ! I 'm on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Radical Destructuralists have been executed there . " How odd that the terrorists of our time would hate authority but believe in what used to be its core symbol , the family . The old anarchists would have been very confused by these people . But , in a way , they made sense to me . I could understand their dream of a peaceful , agricultural America , where the horizon ended with the next farm . I could see something more than violence and rage in these people . They were n't just inept terrorists or starving road people or fanatics . They had their wounds too , like all of us . And because of that , I could make a case for tolerance and understanding . As soon as night fell , the camp went to sleep . As we have all found out , it takes a high level of nutrition and lots of artificial light to keep human beings awake after sunset . They were still like the rest of us were during the famine  --  dead to the world as soon as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex in the shadows , and sensed stirringhere and there in the silence . Birds made their evening calls as last light disappeared behind the Portrillos . Heat lightning flickered . A young woman 's voice , calm and pure , softened the murmuringof the children with a lullaby : " Come and sit by my side if you love me Do not hasten to bid me adieuBut remember the Red River Valley And the cowboy who loves you so true . " When Jim woke me in the middle of the night , I was at first astonished . But not enough , fortunately , to cry out . He can move more quietly than a shadow ; he learned his moves in Asia . We had100 WARDAYgone together in the jungles of hate ; escaping this camp of exhausted , sleeping people was not difficult . " They might have killed us if they 'd seen us , " he said , once we were out on the Las Cruces highway . " I know it , " I said . Desert nights are always cold , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No cars passed . Toward morning we came into the little town of Mesquite . A neon sign and three pickup trucks identified an open diner . We had American-style eggs and bacon , and big mugs of coffee . " Is this New Mexico or Aztlan ? " I asked the waitress . She laughed . " You guys hitching up from Cruces ? " " El Paso . " " Well , you 're out of Aztlan . It peters out between La Mesa and here . Just past where the Japs are doin ' their uranium mining . " We had seconds of coffee and bought some salt beef and Cokes for the road . Los AlamosIt was nearly dark when Whitley and I reached the outskirts of Santa Fe , in northern New Mexico . In the distance , beyond the thin line of awakening city lights , lay the Jemez Mountains . Hidden there , on the mesa , was the city of Los Alamos . We felt that a visit there was essential . It took a long time , however , to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service , and the Santa Fe taxis would n't take us out at any price . Finally we got a ride with a Los Alamos resident , in his gleaming new Toyota . Los Alamos was always a company town , and the company was Uncle Sam . Warday would seem to have ended the need for all that . We really expected to come upon a scene of abandonment . Since the war , scientists have not been well treated in the United States , and this is especially true for nuclear scientists . And there is n't any funding for their work . We could n't imagine the state of New Mexico , for example , spending money to keep Los Alamos in operation . Our driver , whose name is best left unsaid , explained some fundamentaltruths of current life . The people of the mesa had been sealed off from the outside world on Warday . Units of the New Mexico National Guard had blocked all entrances and exits , followed by regular Army troops. 107108 WARDAYThen there was a black year , when the economy of Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Army guardianshipwas abandoned and the unpaid soldiers drifted away . Most of the scientists and their families left , too , choosing to make their way in some less hostile environment . The others createda miniature farming community , using their technological skills to develop viable desert agriculture . We saw the results of this work  --  trickle-irrigated crops , strange-looking greenhouses made of plastic , and an elaborate hydroponic system . We crossed the Rio Grande and made our way up onto a plateau called Parajito , which resembles a large hand divided into fingerlikemesas . There had been rain earlier , and the air was heavily scented with fir and spruce . A peace lay on the land , almost as if it were uninhabited . But after a few miles we came upon the administrativecomplex . I felt an odd fear , seeing the absence of bustle among these familiar buildings . The library building and its classifiedpapers archive were empty , doors swinging open , windows dark . Our driver told us that there had been a serious attack by local residents right after the soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been done then . Local people had also talked of trialsfor the Los Alamos scientists , but there had been no arrests . Nevertheless , the scientists had been glad to leave when they could . Which , it seems , is the central reality of Los Alamos . It is a place of leavings and departures , empty houses and abandoned lives . Nuclear science is a disliked religion in this area . Los Alamos people never spend the night in Santa Fe , and prefer to go in with Japanese guards when they can . As we moved across the mesa , we saw that more buildings were gutted . I recognized these structures . On my last visit to Los Alamos , highly classified work on particle-beam weapons had been going on here . The labs have been moved in their entirety to Japan . And their scientists have gone with them . There is a new " Atomic City , " it seems , being built near Osaka . Los Alamos is a place of caretakers . The plutonium fabrication plant was still standing , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismanTHEWEST 109tling it and crating its exotic innards as reverently as doctors might pack living hearts for transplant . I wanted to go up to one of those Japanese workmen in his white coveralls and shake him and tell him that he was infecting himself and his people . I thought , Japan , Japan , surely you have learned . Let this place be a museum , and let these people be its caretakers . We crossed the bridge that connected one mesa with the other and drove into what had been the main residential and commercial district of prewar Los Alamos . Most buildings were boarded up . But there was a lively open-air market and an astonishing atmosphereof prosperity . The families of the " Japanese friends , " as they call themselves , live in many of the houses vacated by Americanscientists who have already gone to Atomic City . I asked whether they had any choice . Our guide smiled . " We 're going , that 's all I know . The scientist is part of the laboratory . " Were they paid ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is n't the word for it . You get cars , housing , schooling for your kids , all food and medicalcare free , and enough yen to buy the whole damn state of New Mexico . I do n't know what would happen if anybody refused to go . Nobody does ! " I found in myself a kind of desperate urgency . Skill and intelligenceare such valuable resources , and America needs them so badly now . I wanted to say to him , please do n't go . Then I saw a gleam down in the canyon  --  a car that had been pushed off in the night by angry locals . Can you blame them , though ? This is the central station of the nuclear age . Our guide sensed our discomfiture at what was happening here , and explained that scientific study had come to a standstill in America . Science was to some extent blamed for the war . But even where this was n't true , there was no money , as he put it , for contemplation . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplation there is no science . " I felt the vast silence around me and heard the wind whispering in the pines and realized the depth of that truth . I thought about the friendships I had made in Los Alamos be-110 WARDAYfore the war , and the combination of awe and apprehension that I had felt when I first interviewed the scientists and first heard them tell of their work on weapons . I wondered then if it was possible to be divorced from the consequences of one 's work . It seemed to me that no matter how subtle the problem a given weapon presentedor how artful its contemplation might be , the ashes and the bones in the end would be the same . It was n't until we were returning across the Rio Grande , on the same bridge that brought Oppenheimer and his men here in 1940 , that my mood began to lift . Despite all the thoughts that have hung electric in this air , the cottonwoods are still full and green . Across the way , the pueblos of San Ildefonso and Santa Clara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land there , as they had for centuries . Los Alamos , for all its modern history , is returning to ancient ways .

Jim and I are sitting in the observation car , staring out the wide picture windows at the desert . I have n't been to Los Angeles since 1983 . In those days I used to do a certain amount of business with the film companies , and I made occasional trips west . I never cared much for Los Angeles ; people who are consciously trying to be relaxed make me nervous . Jim has been to L.A. more recently , but not since the war . So we have no real way of knowing what to expect of the 1990 immigrationcontrols . We 've heard hard rumors of meticulous police searches and detention pens and people-smuggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a matter of fact , we saw the largest hobo camp we 've encountered so far . It made the little encampment outside of La Mesa seem positively orderly . It was a vast jumble of tents , abandoned vehicles of all types , and human beings . Its residents , the people on the train were saying , were all California rejectees . If so , the border controls must be brutal . I know a few things about L.A. First , with nearly nine million residents , it is by far the most populous city in the United States . Despite the general population decline , it has grown by nearly a million since 1987 . It is more than four times the size of the second largest city , San Francisco , and larger than New York was before the war. 112114 WARDAYThe conductor comes through , calling , " Needles , next stop Needles . " There is stirring in the car . Needles is one of the infamous California ports of entry . To get into the state , you 've got to show twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency , and a valid entry permit . The only way to get such a permit is to have business in the state or a job waiting for you there . We do not have any permits . And between us we have eight hundred paper dollars , the equivalent of only eight gold . None of our fellow passengers have talked about entry , but we sense that we are not alone . There are all kinds of stories about getting into California ; few of them involve the possession of papersand astronomical sums of money . " Needles , " the conductor shouts . " Everybody stay in the train , stay in the train ! " We slow to a crawl and draw up to the platform . I 'm shocked . There are soldiers armed with submachine guns every fifteen feet . Behind them are huge signs : ILLEGAL ALIENS LIABLE TO BE SHOT . STAY IN THE TRAIN . An amplified voice can be heard : " Do not leave the train . Have your entry permits ready . Do not leave the train . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pulling the preciousgreen forms out of purses and wallets . But most are sitting passively , waiting . This is only the first step in their journey . They have timed their arrival carefully . There is n't an outgoing train for another six hours . For that much time they will be in the holding pen . They have staked their lives and their money on the possibility that they will be able to escape and somehow cross mountains and desert to the Los Angeles basin , there to disappear into the golden horde . California State Police officers in white crash helmets , face masks , black leather boots , and khaki uniforms come across the platform in formation . They carry pistols in holsters . At a barked order , half of them draw their weapons . The other half have clipboards . These are some of California 's notorious Processing Officers . When they catch people trying to escape the holding pens , they mark them with indelible green dye . Suddenly a man in full radiation gear comes into the car from the side opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a digital readout . It has a long , thin probe attached . He wavesCALIFORNIA DANGERS 115it back and forth as he moves down the aisle , touching some of the passengers with it , inserting it down the collars of others . He squirts a bright red aerosol on the back of one man 's hand , and tells him that he 's got to go take a detox shower and get an issue of paper clothing before he can even get port-of-entry processing . Jim and I are examined without comment . Apparently this deviceonly measures present radiation . My high lifedose is still my own business , unless I try to enter a hospital without a health card . At the far end of the car he blows a whistle . Immediately , ProcessingOfficers appear at both doors . Behind the man at the front is one of the clipboard carriers . " California registered citizens , " he shouts , " show your colors . " Four people pull out red plastic cards . Captain Clipboard runs them through a device like a credit-card verifier and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One after another , the citizens are given the precious right to stay on the train .

" " What 's the problem , officer ? " " You do n't come up on the computer . Maybe your card 's defective . Go over to customs  --  it 's the yellow door . " Uncertain , nervous , the young man rises from his seat . He goes to the rear of the car . As he is leaving , Captain Clipboard calls out , " Arrest him , he 's a jumper . " The young man leaps down and dashes across the platform , heading for the chainlink fence that separates it from the parking lot . A voice calls in a blaring monotone , " Stop , or we 'll have to shoot . " Then , more gently : " Come on , kid , take it easy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence , two of the U.S. Army types raise their machine guns . " Look , kid , you 're going to die in ten seconds if you do n't climb back down . " The young man stops . He sags against the fence . Slowly he climbs down , into the arms of two other soldiers , who handcuff him , then connect the handcuffs to leg irons and lead him clanking away . " Okay , " Captain Clipboard calls out , " everybody hold up their118 WARDAYentry permits . " Hands thrust up full of green paper . " Hey , good car ! This is gon na be a nice day . " He casts a frown at Jim and me . From another car there rises the sound of female screaming . It goes on and on , trembling into the heat . Captain Clipboard works his way along the aisle . One after another , he puts the green forms on his clipboard and goes over them with a lightpen . Two people are sent to the yellow door .

You 'd be surprised how nervous those dumb army boys get , standing out there in the sun . Let 's go ! " Sixteen of us shuffle off the train , mostly threadbare , eyes hollow , about us all the furtive look of the new American wanderers . We are facing the toughest port-of-entry system in the United States . The odds are that all sixteen of us will be on the outbound train later this afternoon .

Not a few heads turn back , watching it pass the open track barrier . The lucky few inside are already reopening their newspapers and settling back for the run to L.A.We are herded into a fenced-off area about three acres square . There is a cyclone fence twenty feet high , topped by razor wire . At all four corners of the enclosure there are guard houses .

He wears the oak leaves of a major . " Keep this area clear , Private , " he says . His voice is dry and quick . " Yessir ! " The private snaps to attention and salutes his superiorofficer . There is a spit-and-polish about these men that I do n't remember from the prewar army . But under the surface , they 're still American .

For those who ca n't pay the price of a ticket , there are two " state cars " at the end of the train , ancient and filthy . These peoplewill be able to get to Kingman by train , but then they 're on their own . It 's a tragedy for them . There is no more romance to beinga hobo in America . It means starvation , sometimes slow and sometimes fast . We reach the outskirts of Kingman at eight o'clock at night .

" That 's the last time you undercut us , Maggie , " one of the othersmugglers says . " Your prices ai n't worth the risk .

A coal-black Cessna 182 awaits us . Maggie and her boy start a flight check , walking around the plane , moving creaky flaps and rattling what seem to be loose propeller blades . Or maybe they 're supposed to be that way . " You guys ready ? We want to get moving in case the competitioninforms on us . This is a cutthroat business . " She smiles . " You got ID cards ?

You do n't want to have that happen . " We pay our money and get our cards . The plane bounces along the " runway , " at last shuddering into the air with a horrible popping from the engine .

I look at Jim . His eyes are wide . " They 're flying low , " he mutters , " to avoid radar . Since they ca n't see , they 're measuring ground speed against the stopwatch so they can tell when to climb over obstacles . " " More or less . " " If that 's a question , the answer is less . " We fly like this for what seems like hours .

In size , San Francisco is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex , a vast mechanical toy full of buses and clanging trolleys and more cars than either of us have seen in one place in years . It looks like fun , and the tension in the air reminds me a little of New York . As much as there are things that are here from the past , there is something from the present that is missing . It is the sense of having suffered  --  the subtle tension that hangs between friends and strangers alike , everywhere else we have been so far . Californiadid n't suffer too much from the famine , and few people here were weak enough to be killed by the Cincinnati Flu . Radiation sickness is almost unknown , except among refugees . On our first night in the bright streets of Los Angeles , I found myself returning to my old metropolitan habits , moving with quick anonymity and never meeting anybody else 's eyes . There is a much stronger Japanese influence than ever before . The streets are packed not only with Japanese businessmen but also with clerks and factory workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : new Nissans that whistle when they accelerate and get 130 miles to a gallon of gas , sporty Toyota Z-197128 WARDAY90s , Isuzus and Mitsubishis and the occasional Mercedes-Benz . There are also a few Fords , big and beautifully made at the new plant in Fullerton , and a great improvement over the notorious Consensus with the plastic windows . Despite its size , the new Thunderbird gets sixty miles per gallon . It also has a sensor that sounds an alarm if any radioactive particles should be taken into the air-conditioning system . More , though , than its prosperity , L.A. has the feeling of prewarAmerica , the cheer , the confidence , the cheek that one associateswith former days . I indulged myself shamelessly . In Little Tokyo there are dozens of open-air fruit and vegetable stands where melons and tomatoes and lettuce and carrots and squash and dozens of other things are stacked in abundance . Little Tokyo , by the way , now extends all the way to Sixth Street . It must be four times its prewar size . In Little Tokyo I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it like an apple . I have not eaten such a thing in years . It was rich beyond belief , dense with a flavor that swept through my nostrils , heavy with juice . If I could design hydroponicsthat would grow tomatoes that flavorful , I 'd get rich . For fifteen cents we spent half an hour at an open-air sushi bar , sampling the catch and burning our nostrils with Japanese horseradish . Then we strolled on , satiated , only to be tempted a few minutes later into a beautiful ice cream store , which sold a new brand called Sweet Sue . I had a double-dip cone of cherry vanilla and , in honor of my son , pistachio . I wish that my family could enjoy the life here . No wonder the P.O.E. is so strict . If immigration was free , California would be drowned in people . As illegals , we were faced with a number of very serious problems . The first was transportation . There are ten long-distance trolley lines and many more buses than there were before the war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We did not have one and could n't rent one without revealing that our IDs were bogus . So we were condemned to trying to figure out the intricate system of buses , minibuses , trolleys , and Aztlan-like pesetas . Beyond transportation , we had the difficulty of finding a placeCALIFORNIA DANGERS 129to stay . I have enjoyed some extraordinary hotels in Los Angeles : the Beverly Hills , the Chateau Marmont , the Bonaventure . But you ca n't register in a hotel without an ID that will pass the computer . In every bus and trolley , posted in stores and in post offices and pasted on every available public bulletin board , of which there must be thousands , is the following sign : MARTIAL LAW ORDER 106 : IMMIGRATION ORDERPENALTIESIllegal immigrants are liable to arrest and imprisonment for up to three years for the first offense , imprisonment for no less than ten years , without possibility of parole , for the second .

You never know when your suspicions might be worth their weight in gold ! We decided to assume a hostile population and made a few basicrules . First , we had to keep moving . Second , we had to sleep underthe stars . We could n't even risk a rooming house  --  assuming we could find one with a room to rent . Housing is a nightmare in L.A. I saw ads in the Times offering small homes in the Valley for eight hundred in gold , no paper accepted and no mortgages given . Dallas has whole neighborhoods where all you have to do is move in , bring your new house up to code , and it 's yours . Our third rule was that we had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Angelinos .

" Angelinosknow that overpopulation will strangle their prosperity , and they are generally avid to turn in illegals . We could n't risk arous-130 WARDAYing suspicion , especially not among our interviewees and in the officesJim was visiting to get government documents . We spent our first night in a carport at the La Mirada apartments . Immediately after dawn the next day , we had our second taste of conflict between government and members of the Destructuralistmovement . Shouting began echoing up and down La MiradaAvenue from the direction of El Centro . Then there were people running frantically through the carport , breathing hard , followed by battle-dressed officers on black mopeds . One of the escapees dove under a car just beside us . Her gaspingwas so loud that we could hear it over the buzz of the passing mopeds . One of the cops waved his pistol at us . " You do n't see this , " he called . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice from the far end of the alley , " you 're all under arrest ! " Then there came the dismal mutter of capture , the gear-grindingapproach of a small black schoolbus with bars welded across the windows , the quick disappearance of the little band of the desperate . Then silence . Not a window opened in any of the houses that lined the alley , not a curious face appeared . We kept to the dim interior of the carport , listening to the breathing of the person under the car . We stayed like that for some little time . Once somebody came out of the La Mirada , got into a gleaming blue Consensus , and drove away . " It 's quiet , " Jim said at last . " You can come out now . " We then had our only contact with the Conspiracy of Angels , and learned a little more about the nature of Destructuralism . A Statement by an Anonymous Member ofthe Conspiracy of AngelsPeople can not continue to hide from the fact that this civilization is totally bankrupt . Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not going to build up all over again and wind up with an even worse war . That is where the Destructuralist Movement comes in , and the Angels are militant Destructuralists . What is Destructuralism , you might ask , and what 's in it for me and my family ? First off , Destructuralism says that your person and those you make your family are the only valid social unit , and the maintenance of that family is the only valid economic activity . We say that the whole social edifice , from the Boy Scouts right up to the Army , is essentially an addiction , that it is more than unnecessary , it is dangerous . Social structures are the breeding ground of ideology , greed , and territorialism . Agricultural communitiesare peaceful communities , and families bound together by need and love do not go to war . No matter how benign a given structure seems , it will inevitablylead to the same consequences all social structures lead to , namely , war and death . Real social harmony comes not from lawbooksbut from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then it is perfectly obvious that we181182 WARDAYare eternally condemned to the slavery of warfare , and probably also to extinction . Government is institutionalized dehumanization . People who deal with paper instead of other people lose the all-important thread of contact from heart to heart . Here 's a story about a social structure that all of America loves , the British Relief . A man who joined our movement got eye cancer and the Relief did triage on him and sent him home . People wait in line for days , only to be told by some English nanny that they ca n't even get an aspirin . And if you go black market for medicine and get caught , it is not a jury of your peers that tries you , it is the Relief . And they forced you onto the black market in the first place . This man with eye cancer bought black-market chemotherapy , got caught , and had to pay a fine , even though he was dying . He became an Angel a month before he took henbane from a witch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of structure , or at least suffered from it . There is no shortage of painkillers , for example . The Relief could have given him Brompton Mixture on an outpatient basis , but the rules reserve it for inpatients only , and he could n't be an inpatient because he was triaged ! So the structure  --  simply because it was there  --  at the very least condemned him to unnecessary agony . If his family had been in control of his fate , instead of some bureaucrat in the Relief officedown at the civic center , he would have been spared the tormentand indignity of the pain . People say thank God Europe did n't get in the war , what would we do without them , but the Angels say we are just suffering more because of the structures that are now being imposed on us from the outside . When Washington was destroyed , we had a golden , historic opportunity to free ourselves from the age-old slavery of government . Instead , we are having both economic and political structure imposed on us from the outside  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to what the Europeans practiced on the Chinese in the last century . The foreign presence on our shores is nothing more than a prescription for more structural enslavement , with the added problem that we do n't even control the structure . Also , they take crops from the few viable growing areas and alCALIFORNIADANGERS 188locate them not only to North America but also to themselves . Remember , if we were n't feeding Europe too , we would n't be starving ourselves . The story is that they have gone into Argentinaand taken it over to make sure the crops are not held up for high prices . Argentina is no longer even a country . If you read the English papers , they always call it " the Argentine " or some such thing . We believe that most of the population south of the border is dead of starvation , and the Europeans caused it by taking the only food our Latin sisters and brothers could get their hands on , the Argentine wheat . That is hundreds of millions of deaths . We call ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember the dishonored dead of the world , those who died on Warday in the United States and the USSR , and the billions who have died since . We represent the living , the ordinary men and women and children who see that , in order to survive , mankind needs a whole new way of being . There is inherent in Destructuralism the concept that people can remake their own hearts to include a new valuation of their fellowhuman beings . By refocusing our energies on our families we can learn never to forget for an instant how it feels to be the other person . For example , the American President and the Russian Premiercould not have done what they did to the rest of us on Warday if they had been trained from birth never to forget for an instant that all human beings are partners in life and that everybody is as important to himself or herself as they were to themselves  --  that the death of the average Joe was going to be as much of a catastrophefor him and his family as the death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self and his relatives . Instead , they sat in their command posts and talked numbers . To Destructuraliststhere are no numbers , there are only names and faces and hearts . Only in a truly destructured , rehumanized social milieu can the kind of maturing growth that people need take place , because only if there are no distancing structures can the individual come to realize , through his identification with his own family , that every other life on earth is as precious and valuable as his own . You might argue that Destructuralism is old-style anarchy all over again , but it is n't . Destructuralism is based on the caring of134 WARDAYmature human souls for one another and for the planetary body , too . It is government by putting yourself in the other man 's shoes . The bible said , " Do unto others as you would have them do unto you . " That is all the government the world needs . Remember this : If you love life and think that big government is big poison , and you are willing to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , do not scorn the Angels , for you are one . FugitivesAs soon as she finished her statement , our friendly Angel got into the nearest American-made car , reached under the dashboard , and hot-wired it . " You want a ride ? " We did n't . We just wanted to disappear . She backed out into the alley and was soon off down La Mirada . Not ten seconds after the car had disappeared , there came a roar from about thirty feet overheadand an ultralight aircraft darted past in the direction she had gone . There are large numbers of these planes in Los Angeles skies , used by police and fire departments to keep detailed tabs on rooftops and backyards . Soon , more of the moped cops shot past on La Mirada . We were scared . The penalties for being an illegal immigrant in California are severe . Capture could mean years in a work camp . Maybe all the years I have left . " Let 's get out of here , " Jim said . " Half the police department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reply . I was thinking of Anne and Andrew , wondering what they were doing . It was a quarter to six in Dallas . I could imagine my family out in the henhouse , Anne collecting eggs while Andrew did the cleaning . I could hear the hens clucking and smell13513B WARDAYthick henhouse odors mixing with the aroma of morning coffee floating across from the kitchen . Another ultralight appeared and began circling us as we walked along La Mirada . It was all I could do not to break and run as the damned thing soared round and round overhead , its engine whining like an angry wasp . Jim stopped and looked up , shielding his eyes from the sun . " Do n't do that ! " " It 's more suspicious to ignore him . " The policeman 's amplified voice crackled down : " IDs , please ! " We held up our red plastic cards . He peered down as he made another sweep , then flew off , talking into his radio . " Do you think that did it , Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We walked on , heading for the Santa Ana Freeway . If we could catch an interregional bus there , it just might take us all the way to Burbank . Suddenly a black car pulled up , and behind the wheel was an unexpected but welcome sight : a priest in a Roman collar . " Get in , " he said . The thought crossed my mind that he might be a police agent . Then a siren began wailing . I could see the lights of a squad car far down La Mirada . " Get in , " the priest repeated . " Hurry up about it ! " We got into the old Buick . " Down , down , you darned fools ! " As the squad car roared past , we dropped to the floor of the back seat . " They 're on foot , " a voice rattled from the front seat . I was astonished to realize that the priest had a police radio . " Two-four-two to Air Six . We do not , repeat , do not have them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's a relief , anyway . " " Father  --  " " Keep down ! " He drove us to his rectory , where we got a shave , a shower , and a much-needed change of clothing . He never referred to the Destructuralists , or why he had been in that particular neighborhood at that time , or why he had so mercifully helped us . He believed strongly in the value of human freedom , though , and in the old Bill of Rights . You can read that between the lines of the interview he gave us . InterviewReverend Michael Dougherty , Catholic PriestI was afraid we would n't have time to do this , but I think you 're probably safe here for another half hour or so . I 'm glad to get the chance to speak for publication . We 've forgotten a few basic humanfreedoms out here in sunny California . We need to rediscover ourselves as Americans  --  as people , really . As children of God . Sometimes I think of the world  --  is that thing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , okay . Sometimes I think of the world as a little lost bit of dust in the middle of nowhere , and it is deathly ill , and there is nobody to help us . But then I feel the presence of Christ , as if He had taken the world in His arms and was hugging us to Himself the way a father might hug a hurt child . I think that we Americans are feeling terribly guilty about ourselves . Especially the older generation . I see the effects . One of them is that priests like me have gotten incredibly busy , and one of the things that keeps me busiest is ministering to the sad and the guilty . We 've got three priests here at St. Francis , me and two newly ordained , as well as three deacons and four nuns . I 've been a priest since 1975 , so I 'm an old hand . That rarity , the prewar religious . The rest are all new . Since Warday , my parish has more than quadrupled in size . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't full .

And the elders too , now , fumbling with the St. Joseph 's missals we have in the church , saying their prayers as best they can . But it 's in the confessional that I hear the motives people have for returning to the Church . It is n't piety or love of God , not among the older folks . People are coming back to the Church because they feel that their own indifference , just letting things happen , was a big part of what caused the war . Remember , back in those days it just seemed like there was nothing you personally could do . The solutions now to our problems then seem obvious . But in those days we were all very different people . We were dulled by living under the Sword of Damocles for nearly half a century . We had done the worst possible thing  --  gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism was far more hazardous to each one of us individually than , say , pouring gasoline on our clothes would have been . But it did n't feel that way , not in those sunny , treacherous days . We understood how absolutely deadly the bomb was , but we did not understand how helpless we were in the face of the mechanismof war . The mechanism began to run quite mysteriously , and went on until it broke down . It could as easily have destroyed the world . Only faulty design prevented that . We thought that people dickering about arms control in Geneva mattered , when what we really needed all along was a massive change of heart . How absurdlyoutmoded the elaborate diplomacy of the prewar period now seems . There could have been a massive shift of heart , toward acceptanceand understanding and away from hostile competitivenessand ideological obsession . The whole business of the United States and the USSR squanderingtheir resources on territorialism seems incredibly silly now . Our prewar mistake was to believe in rubble . We visualized ourselvesas crawling out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't just cease to exist . You know , they say that a person set down in the middle of the Washington Dead Zone would have died within hours . Just keeled over and died . Birds died flying across it . That was in the L.A. Times after the war . It 's a forty-square-mile desert of black glassCALIFORNIA DANGERS 189dotted with the carcasses of sparrows and larks and the occasional duck . Before the war there were n't even intellectual references for such things . No comprehension . The message of Hiroshima was n't understood . We thought that it meant devastation . But ruins have to do with the past . Modern nuclear war means life being replaced by black , empty space . It means ancient seats of government evaporatingin a second . The moral question is almost beyond asking . What are we , that we can do this ? What is evil , that it can speak with such a voice ? We no longer know what we are , we of the Holocaustand Stalin and Warday . We unleashed hell on ourselves by pretending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fires . The heart , and the heart alone , is more powerful than hell . Am I preaching ? Excuse me . I run so fast , give so much advice , quite frankly I think I 've forgotten how to talk without a degree of pontification . Sometimes I wish I had a wife to have a private life with . Someone who would say , " You 're preaching , Mike , " or " You 're talking through your hat . " But I do n't have time for a wife . Or children . I could n't raise kids in a life that does n't have ten free minutes a day . So I 'm no longer uptight about the celibacy rule . Before Warday I was well on my way to losing my vocation . I wanted to get married . I think I might have become an Episcopalian . But then came Warday and , afterward , the Reunion with the Anglicans and the Episcopals . Then , most of all , the tremendousupsurge of need for my services . I got the feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of forgiveness and need , asking for our help . I want to be Christ 's servant . Now when I 'm feeling alone I take my soul to Mary , who is His mother and thereforethe mother of all mankind . She 's what the witches call the Mother Goddess ! I just kneel before her altar and say the rosary . She never fails me , Mary . The rosary is far better for me than , say , meditation . It 's not only meditation , with all the repetition , it 's humble and it 's a request for help . She was once a human being . She knows what we suffer . She is always there , anytime , for anybody . Mary does n't care a fig about the details . She loves and respectsyou because you exist. 140 WARDAYThe witchcraft movement talks about taking personal , individualresponsibility for the condition of planet Earth as if they inventedthe idea . But it 's also a Christian and very specifically Catholic notion . At least I think it is . My saddest , guiltiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of personal action on behalf of peace between the United States and the Soviet Union . They say they should have demonstrated against this or in favor of that . But I tell them no , the sin was that we did not accept one another in our hearts , neither side . Our leaders hardly even knew each other . The two greatest nations on earth , with almost total responsibility for the fate of planet and species , and they hardly even spoke ! They should have made it their business to be close personal friends . And there should have been as much commonality of policymaking and government as possible . Instead the two countries were separate islands , distant from , and mysterious to , each other . That was the sin of pride , doing that . What a price has been paid for the pleasure of such indulgence . When I think of what our generation did , I pray very , very hard that the future will somehow accept us and find in the Body of Christ the love and understanding that will enable them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hostility over acceptance , but we understand and we forgive . " Now I 'm not your deep thinker . But I do try . I 've read the Catholicphilosophers , and the Greeks , and most of the moderns . I mean to say , I 've read my Whitehead and my Hegel , my Aristotle and my Plotinus . You know , throughout history , philosophy centered on the conceptof being rather than the ethics . That was fine until recent years , when we began to try on some pretty bizarre concepts , and to hell with the ethics of it all . Nazism and so forth , I mean . And the concept of nationhood that allowed us to think we had the right to build such things as nuclear bombs . The American and Russian peoples should never have allowed their leaders to play the game of overstating the threat to justify exorbitant military expenditures . We were supposed to be seeking a balance of terror , were n't we ? But the United States in fact got so far ahead of the Russians technologically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have made their missiles uselessCALIFORNIA DANGERS 141against us . And they had no similarly effective weapon . So they were forced to start the war . They were backed up against the wall . I 'm just a priest in a medium-sized parish . Nobody on high would ever have listened to me . Before the war I had eight hundred in my parish . Now I 've got close to ten thousand frightened and suffering people . In some ways I 'd rather have had eight hundredand the old world than ten thousand and the new . Let 's see now , you asked me for an idea about how my day goes . What I do . Well , I get up at five-thirty and I run like a madmanuntil midnight , then I sleep like the dead until five-thirty the next morning . I 've got my schedule for last Wednesday . I 'll read it into the record : 5:30 A.M. Arose and said breviary. 5:45 A.M. Breakfast of corn soup and milk. 6:00 A.M. Said Mass . Gave out communion to 230 people. 6:30 A.M. Meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Father Moore 's report to the bishop on the feasibility of splitting St. Francis into two parishes . I hope that this is done ! 7:00 A.M. Met a parishioner who has just been diagnosed as havingstage-three Hodgkin 's and has been triaged . Has a wife and three teenage children . Is fifty-two . We prayed together and he cried . He paced like a trapped lion . Prayed for him and put him in the Mass list for Sunday. 7:20 A.M. CCD leaders met in my office to plan a bake sale . They have thirty pounds of flour , six pounds of sugar , some apples , some molasses , and so we are very excited . Thank God they also have Sister Euphrasia , who is one good baker. 7:45 A.M. Had coffee and listened to the Vatican U.S. Service on the shortwave. 8:00 A.M. Went to Holy Cross Hospital for my visitations . I 'm glad I took Father Moore , as my list was sixty names long ! I had an hour there , and because he took half my people , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessed , I prayed , I heard eighteen confessions and gave out thirty Holy Communions . I gave the Last Rites to twelve patients on the critical list. 9:15 A.M. Returned to the rectory . Did youth counseling until142 WARDAYnoon . We have seventy young people who are converting , and an active Sodality and CYO . But these were all special cases . I gave each kid half an hour . Saw six troubled kids . A girl who is pregnant . A boy who is in love with a younger boy . A girl who says she sees visions of the Virgin , and indeed may . Another girl who has beaten her mother and father so badly that they want her out of the house . Where does a petite girl of sixteen get such titanic anger ? Two boys who steal . I warned them very sternly . They must remember , these children , that we have a looting law here in California , and they are liable to be shot on sight if they 're caught . It is n't like the old days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunsight. 12:15 P.M. Lunch of soybean soup , lettuce with vinegar and oil , and a delicious Budweiser. 12:30 P.M. Met with Parish Council . We are going to try to expandour food program this winter . Last year we distributed 31,280 meals to the hungry . This year we are going to try for fifty thousand . Mrs. Cox said that the baby boy found behind the rectory last week was just fine , normal in every way , and has been placed with the Tucker family . They are at risk for having children , so they are terribly grateful. 1:00 P.M. Met with Joe O'Donnell , who is thinking about running for chief of police . The most powerful job in the Valley . Will he do it ? He 'd do a very creditable job , I feel sure . I promised to call the bishop on his behalf . There is certainly nothing wrong with having a Catholic in that job , and Joe is a good man. 1:15 P.M. Back to the church for fifteen minutes of prayer . Spent it with Mary and had wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made our connection with deity stronger ? Sometimes I feel as if Christ and Mary are here , alive , almost in the flesh . This , I suppose , is faith. 1:30 P.M. Catechism with my eighth-graders . Fifty kids . What a bunch of jokers ! I love that class . We might be in hell , but kids are kids , always . What did I find in the question box ? " Father , if you could n't consummate marriage any other way , would it be permissibleto use an Erector Set ? " Kid 's humor . We are into sex education . Some of these children are sterile. 2:30 P.M. Adult counseling for two hours . I took a CharismaticCALIFORNIA DANGERS 143study group for half an hour , then a disturbed couple , then a womanwho has bone cancer and is contemplating euthanasia . PersonallyI detest the practice , but I can see if I get a really rough cancer I might want to turn to it myself . His Holiness and the Archbishop of Canterbury have agreed that it 's no sin to withdraw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised to attend her. 4:30 P.M. Spent ten minutes with my breviary. 4:40 P.M. Went to the church and said Benediction . Our choir is just wonderful . Who would have thought ten years ago that I would have a full choir for weekday afternoon service ? Not to mention two hundred people in the church . Christ has not failed us . He is awakening our hearts. 5:00 P.M. Heard confessions for an hour . " Bless me , Father , for I have sinned . " How I love them , my dear parishioners . I will not speak of their sins , except to say that they are good people , and I know they are forgiven their little transgressions . I tell them to make penance a sacrament of self-discovery . Confession should be a joy. 6:00 P.M. Supper . Vegetable goulash with nice big pieces of sausage . Another Bud . Much laughter and joking around our big table of men and women . We have a lot of fun together. 7:00 P.M. BBC Overseas Service News . The U.K. has recognized the Kingdom of Azerbaijania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could n't find it . Somewhere in the former Soviet Union , but where ? 7:30 P.M. " Moon Over Morocco , " a cigarette , and a cup of coffee . My half hour of indulgence ! That 's a delightful radio show . I must admit that I miss TV . Boy , what I would n't give to feast my eyes on " M*A*S*H " just one more time . As a semipublic institution , we have some chance of getting a TV before too much longer . The BBC is already beaming shows over here by satellite , and Ted Turner is getting organized again in Atlanta and L.A. Also , HBO and the networks are coming back . Soon , please , and do n't neglect the half-hour format , because that 's all I have time for ! 8:00 P.M. Meeting of the Charismatics in the basement of the church . I 'm glad that Sister Euphrasia and Father Booth are both members of this movement ! I ca n't begin to speak in tongues . I ca n't keep up with their intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's people , these Charismatics . We are going to have to move our group upstairs . Three hundred people are too many for the basement . Might even be a fire hazard. 9:00 P.M. Meeting of the Knights of Columbus in the school cafetorium . Full-dress affair . I led prayers . We are making elaborate plans for the Christ the King procession upcoming. 10:00 P.M. A call from the man who was diagnosed as terminal Hodgkin 's yesterday . Met him in the church and we said the rosary together . He told his family over supper . He says they spent the evening singing and talking about how close the Lord is to them now . I suggested they go to the Charismatic meeting tomorrow night . They heal each other all the time , maybe they 'll heal him . But I did n't say that to him . I said , if he feels Christ in him so strongly , he belongs among them , and so does his family. 11:00 P.M. Breviary for fifteen minutes , and another fifteen reading the new Mailer book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11:30 P.M. My five minutes in the shower . Father Moore snapped me with a towel . How I would like to be twenty-three years old again ! These old bones .. . 12:00 A.M. Lights out at the St. Francis rectory . Silence . My cross , a darker shadow on my dark wall . The wind moaning past the eaves . Sleep , and a dream of long ago . Documents from the Civil DefenseThere goes the night brigade They got no steady trade .. .  --  Ezra PoundHELPFUL HINTS FOR THE UNAFFECTED : BLUEGRAMSYou probably do n't know about Bluegrams . I certainly did n't see any in Texas during the war , and Whitley does n't remember them from New York . They are apparently called Bluegrams because they are printed on light-green paper . There is an element of practicality about Bluegrams . Their distribution , however , appears to be limited to areas where they are n't needed . So , in case you might find them useful , I include here the two most practical ones we picked up . One sees Bluegrams in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or left in stacks on the counters of luncheonettes . We could have included Bluegrams on control of radioactive roachesor on the washing of hot cars with sponges attached to fishing poles , but we decided to limit ourselves to material of at least some interest to people who live in the communities for which they were obviously intended in the first place . Why do n't areas of genuine need get Bluegrams ? Maybe the Civil Defense officials responsible do n't want to upset us , or  --  more likely  --  they 'd rather stay in California than set out with their little blue trucks to that softly glowing world beyond the Sierras. 145148 WARDAYCIVIL DEFENSE BULLETIN December 13 , 1988HOME OR BUSINESS PROTECTION FROM RADIATIONIn the event that the United States sustains another nuclear attack , you are advised to seek the best protection possible for yourself and your family . If you live in or near a city , you should receive advance warning of an attack . It is possible , however , with the current emergency conditions , and with only partially repaired communications , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at best . In some cases , you will learn of an attack only after it has occurred . IN EITHER CASE , YOU MUST TAKE PROTECTIVE ACTION IMMEDIATELYAND IN THE STRUCTURE WITH THE HIGHEST PROTECTIVE LEVEL AVAILABLE TO YOU AT THE TIME . Different buildings and structures vary in the level of radiation protection offered . In general , basements or rooms underground offer the best protection . In an emergency , however , you and members of your family may have to make quick judgments as to the best and most accessible place available to you at the time . The following examples list structures along with their respective protectionfactors . The higher the factor , the better the protection . TYPICAL BUILDINGS AND THEIR PROTECTIVE VALUEType of Building FactorUnderground shelters covered by 3 feet or more 1000+ of dirt , or sub-basements of buildings with more than 5 storiesBasement fallout shelters , basements without 250exposed walls , and central areas of upper floors to ( not top 3 ) with heavy exterior walls 1000Basements of buildings with frame and brick 50veneers , central area of basements with partially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( not top floor ) in multistory buildings with heavy floors and exterior wallsCALIFORNIA DANGERS 147TYPICAL BUILDINGS AND THEIR PROTECTIVE VALUEType of Building FactorBasements without exposed walls of 1  --  2 story 10buildings and central areas of upper floors ( not totop ) of multistory buildings with light floors and 50wallsPartially exposed basements of 1  --  2 story 2buildings and central areas on ground floor of tosimilar buildings with heavy masonry walls 10Aboveground rooms of light residential homes 2 oror apartments LessREMEMBER , SOME PROTECTION IS BETTER THAN NONE . GOOD PROTECTION WILL SAVE LIVES ! 148 WARDAYFOR LOCAL DISTRIBUTIONCIVIL DEFENSE DIRECTIVE A-25 December 15 , 1988EMERGENCY INSTRUCTIONS FOR RADIOLOGIC DECONTAMINATIONTHE FOLLOWING EMERGENCY GUIDELINES SHOULD BE FOLLOWEDUNTIL FULL-SCALE GOVERNMENT DECONTAMINATION EFFORTS CANBE UNDERTAKEN . If you live near a War Zone , or if you are being billeted temporarily by military or local government , you may be in considerable danger through contact with materials that have been made radioactive by the bomb explosion itself , or from fallout . Radioactivity can not be seen . The only sure way to know if radioactivity is present is to use electronic detectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , or from the military units assigned to your area . BUT WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU DO N'T HAVE ACCESS IMMEDIATELY TO RADIATION DETECTORS ? It 's best to be safe . If you live within 100 miles of a designated War Zone , it is highly likely that you will have at least some objects or surfaces affected with radioactivity . Or , if you live within any of the areas where fallout has occurred , you probably have some degree of contamination . MOST RADIATION WILL DISAPPEAR WITHIN 60  --  90 DAYS . HOWEVER , DEPENDING UPON YOUR LOCATION AND PROXIMITY TO A BOMBED AREA , YOU COULD HAVE SUFFICIENT RADIOACTIVITY PRESENT TO CAUSE SERIOUS ILLNESS . IF POSSIBLE , YOU SHOULD CHECK WITH YOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR WITH MILITARY AUTHORITIES TO DETERMINE THE LIKELIHOOD OF RADIOACTIVITYIN YOUR HOME OR BILLETING AREA . If you know some radioactivity is present , or you suspect this to be the case , then you should utilize the following methods for decontaminating commonmaterials and surfaces . CALIFORNIA DANGERS 1491 . CLOTHINGClothing that is heavily contaminated , e.g. , that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once and buried in a location that will not affect water supplies . Other clothing can be brushed or washed , though you should be careful to control the runoff in order to prevent further contamination . Using a detergentwill help . All washing should be done in one area and the runoff directed to the same collector , which later can be covered up . Always use gloves if you can , and wash yourself thoroughly afterwards. 2 . FOODPackaged food can be brushed or washed , though you should watch out for dust particles . Unprotected food should be disposed of as soon as possible . You should not plan to hunt for wild game for another four months ; the possibility that wildlife has ingested radioactive particles is still dangerously high. 3 . METAL AND PAINTED SURFACESMetal or painted surfaces , including cars and trucks , can be washed or scrubbed , with or without detergents or cleansing agents . Again , you should control the runoff . The use of complexing agents  --  oxalates , carbonates , acidsor oxidizing agents  --  can be useful for porous surfaces but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 . LARGE STRUCTURESLarge structures , such as houses , buildings , barns , etc. , are most quickly cleaned with water sprays . Structures that are heavily contaminated , however , will need more intensive treatment . Chemical treatment may be necessary ; abrasion or sandblasting may be necessary with concrete and brick . Runoff can be a major problem , and all cleaning personnel should wear protectiveclothing and masks. 5 . TERRAINEarth surfaces that are radioactive can be removed , though disposal can be a problem . For farming areas , plowing under may be the most expedient action , but the ground remains radioactive for some time and may not be readilyusable again . You should consult your local authorities about any substantial earth-moving activity you propose . Protective clothing should be worn at all times , and face masks , such as those worn by medical personnel , should be used. 150 WARDAY6 . WATERStanding water , such as that in pools or tanks , should not be used and little can be done to purify the water , short of using complex ion-exchange equipment . Water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of having passed through radioactive areas . Water for personal consumptionshould be purified using available equipment or homemade devices , such as natural filtration through buckets filled with stones , clay , and other filtrating materials . Filtered water should then be treated with iodine tabletsto remove any trace of radioactive iodine . Water from deep ground wells should be usable without treatment . WARNING : IF YOU ARE UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE LEVEL OF RADIOACTIVITYOF ANY OBJECT OR SURFACE , USE CARE AND DECONTAMINATE ! DO NOT HESITATE TO CONSULT YOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR MILITARY AUTHORITIES FOR ASSISTANCE . RumorsMutants and Super-BeastsJim and I heard our first rumor on the trolley into L.A. Since then , we 've found that rumors run in the blood of this city . RUMOR : There is a gigantic beast with bat wings and red , burningeyes that has attacked adults and carried off children . The creature stands seven feet tall and makes a soft whistling noise . It is often seen on roofs in populated areas , but only at night . FACT : Of all the rumors we heard , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times reporters , we called Dr. Edward Wagner of UCLA , a biologist , and asked him to comment on the possibility that some sort of radiation-induced mutation could have produced a new species of giant bat . Dr. Wagner stated that giantismis a fairly well understood evolutionary phenomenon that is caused by space-competition among species . He doubted that something as fully developed as this could have come about in the thirty-odd bat generations that have elapsed since the war . A Glendale resident , who was attacked in August of ' 91 , recordedhis experience in the weekly Glendale Courier : I had just gotten off the Glendale trolley when I heard this soft sort of cooing noise coming from the roof of a house . The sound was repeated and I turned to look toward the house . Standing on151152 WARDAYthe roof was what looked like a man wrapped in a cloak . Then it spread its wings and whoosh ! it was right on top of me ! I remember it smelled awful , like something dead . It was working at my face with these long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it started snapping its teeth and hissing . Its wings were wrapped around me . I was smothering in there , in the stink of the thing . When I saw its eyes , red and glaring , hideous , I thought it was the devil come for me and I gave out a scream . Just like that , it spread its wings and started flying , its fingers still around my head . I was dragged halfway down the block , then it let me go and took off into the sky , cooing and hissing . I saw the moonlight glint off its wings , then it was gone . The individual who told this story to the paper was also reported to have extensive scars on his neck and head , of the type that long fingernails or talons might make . We have no further information about this story . RUMOR : Radiation has caused many terrible mutations , such as babies who claw their way out of the mother 's womb just as the first contractions of labor start . Also , babies who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal children , usually monkeysor pigs . FACT : We have great difficulty getting used to the high level of mutation that is an inevitable side-effect of high ambient radiation . Naturally , mutations occur with greatest frequency in areas most seriously radiated . A mother in California , for example , has little more chance of bearing a mutant child than before the war , but a mother in Dallas is many times more likely to bear a mutant . Mutations take two basic forms , degenerative and progressive . Ninety-nine out of a hundred degenerative mutations involve some sort of destruction or malformation of the fetus . They never involveatavism , such as a woman giving birth to an animal child . Such a mutation is probably not possible . Nor are they likely to involvesuch farfetched nonsense as babies with claws or babies with fully developed genitals . The truth is much more prosaic , and much sadder . Common mutations are malformed limbs , bones , or eyes , brain disorders , and malfunctioning organs , such as impropCALIFORNIADANGERS 158erly formed hearts . In cases where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents may elect euthanasia . Progressive mutations are much more rare , but they are not unknown . The most usual progressive mutation we are aware of is so-called hyperintelligence syndrome ( HIS ) . Babies displaying this syndrome exhibit certain common characteristics : they are extremelyaware even at birth and are generally capable of lifting their heads , smiling , and making organized sounds within a few hours of being born . This initial precociousness is not followed up , however , at least not evenly . There are HIS children three years old who can read Shakespeare but are still mastering the art of walking . A common problem in HIS children is difficulty acclimatizingto extreme stimuli such as loud sounds or bright colors . HIS children generally learn reading and mathematics by passive assimilationby the age of two or three . The oldest known HIS child , Charlie B. , is now four . He was born in Philadelphia eleven months after Warday , six months before that city was temporarily evacuateddue to high radiation levels caused by the Washington and New York strikes . Charlie B. is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is the clear intellectual superior of all adults who work with him . He has no formal education ; indeed , there is no educational system yet devised that can help him . He reads four languages , is conversant in the most abstruse mathematicsand physics , and has what his parents describe as a " vast " memory . He is often despondent . His family has plans to move from its present home in Los Angeles to England if Charlie is accepted , at the age of seven , by Oxford . There are eighteen identified HIS children in the United States . Twenty-four are known to have been born , but one was killed in a home fire and five have died for other reasons . Poor reporting and record-keeping may mean that there are undiagnosed HIS children . These two are the basic " mutant/super-beast " rumors that are current in California . Variations are many , including the Hopping Devil rumor that seems to be a variant of the Giant Bat story , and154 WARDAYthe story of the secret think-tank at Cal Tech where Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which they do not share with the Americans . Since there can not be any HIS children older than four , this last rumor appears to be without real substance , though the exploitationof HIS children is something that the Relief or some responsibleU.S. agencies should certainly examine very closely . The Immigrant QuickstepFather Dougherty explained to us that the only way to evade the California authorities was to keep moving from city to city or , even better , to leave the state at once . He warned us that we were takinggreat risks staying in L.A. even long enough to go downtown so Jim could gather documents from the remains of the old federal government , which has its offices in the L.A. Federal Complex . When it became clear to him that we were n't going to change our minds , he insisted on driving us . He felt that , without help , we had no chance of staying out of the hands of the police . On the way into the center of the city , Father Dougherty told us that , like it or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim got his documents . He briefed us about how to contend with the various travel zones . " You have Red Zones , Yellow Zones , Blue Zones , and Green Zones . Stick to the Greens . They lead to the intrastate tracks , which will be on your left as you pass through the main waiting room . Yellow Zones are for incoming trains from our sister **28;13352;TOOLONG , Washington and Oregon . Red Zones are for trains arriving from abroad , which means the rest of the United States . Do n't even look as if you might be interested in them . Remember that the IPs are just dying to check you out . Need I add that there is also a White Zone in the waiting room ? It's155158 WARDAYfor the outgoing Southwest and Sunset Limiteds , and the Desert Wind . Nobody will bother you in the White Zone . " We arrived at the Federal Complex and parked . There were plenty of empty spaces . Father Dougherty and I would wait while Jim looked up a few likely parties in the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years he researched and wrote about atomic weapons and the community of men around them . The federal government takes up only the lower floors of the federal building . Most of the structure is given over to the CaliforniaState Department of Small-Scale Agricultural Control ( SouthernRegion ) , an organization devoted to the licensing and regulation of private gardens . According to Father Dougherty , Jim had at all costs to avoid straying into any part of the complex controlled by the state . " The President and the Governor are n't friends , " was the way he put it . " This is a state in name only . Within five years it 's going to be accreditingambassadors . Already there 's an Embassy Row in Sacramento . But as far as the Feds are concerned , you 'll be subject to their laws on their territory  --  which means you 'll have full constitutionalrights below the eighth floor of the building . If somebody on the federal floors asks for your ID , ask for his warrant . But , for God 's sake , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could see that Jim was edgy . I did not envy him this duty . We hoped for the chance of an interview with the President , or at least with some senior officials . So little is known nowadays about the federal government , we felt that anything we could get would be of enormous value . The silence of waiting settled into the car . Father Dougherty turned on the radio , a new Sony . There were about ten stations up and down the dial . Twisting it , I heard the Beach Boys . Their voices , the tone and feel of the music , evoked the past , summer weather . How anybody can bear to listen to the Beach Boys for very long these days , I can not imagine . It is interesting that the past has come to seem so beautiful . I wish we could remember it clearly enough to avoid its mistakes . But I am coming to recall it more for its laughter than its danger . I remember how Anne and I used to enjoy SoHo , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by about ' 84 . Extremes in art spoke to us then , though I can not now remember why . Americawas sunshine , was n't it ? It was also excitement . I remember , for example , space exploration . At the time I took at most mild interest , but now I 'm fascinated . What wonders we accomplished : the moon landings and Viking , and the Space Shuttle . Most of all , the confirmation by the Infrared Astronomy Satellite in ' 85 of the planetary system around Barnard 's Star , with a fifth planet that might be very like Earth . Suddenly Father Dougherty started the car . Jim was hurrying toward us , a thick manila envelope under his arm . " I did n't manage to see the President , " he said as he got in , " but I got good stuff . Some Presidential papers on radiation , and a report on the state of the upper atmosphere . " " Meaning you two will finally do the sensible thing and leave Los Angeles ? " Jim nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but maybe I 'll pick some up in San Francisco . " " So you still intend to remain in California , do you ? I ca n't bear the thought of people getting arrested for nothing . I wish you 'd reconsider . The moment you buy a White Zone ticket , the IPs will leave you alone . " We had been through this at the rectory . We did n't need him to convince us of how poor our odds were . But the book could not be complete without a visit to San Francisco . " We 've got to try , Father . " He sighed , then got out of the car and opened the trunk . He brought out a small suitcase , opened it on the front seat . " These are clerics ' suits . Get into the darned things and God go with you . " I am not sure how convincing we were as priests , but the collarsand jackets certainly changed our attitudes . To cops we would now seem a lot more confident , a lot more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a bit too short . " Well now , Fathers , " Father Dougherty said , " you look like a couple of rascals if ever I saw them . " He showed us the priestly blessing . " People will ask for it , so be ready to give it . God will forgive you for this little impersonation , since it 's in a good cause , " he said . Then he drove us158 WARDAYto Union Station and blessed us himself . " Take my advice and buy your tickets on the White Zone trains . " He laughed . " I sound like a broken record , I know . But please . For your own sakes . " We thanked him and said good-bye . There was an atmosphere of subdued intensity in Union Station . Along one wall of the waiting room , a high cyclone fence encloseda makeshift holding area . In it , the morning 's suspects sat on benches , most of them going through their purses and wallets before they appeared before the examiners to verify their right to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the P.O.E. nets , only to be tripped up just when they must have thought they were free . It does not take long for such scenes to seem normal . We bought tickets on the Coast Daylight , which was leaving for Oakland in thirty minutes , and sat ourselves down in the Green Zone waiting area with our tickets showing from our top pockets , like everybody else . The economy sections of the train were alreadyfull , so we were forced to buy First Class Ultras , which are four times as expensive as normal coach seats . We consoled ourselveswith the thought that a police spot check of two priests in the VIP cars was unlikely . Documents fromthe Acting PresidencyI believe we must adjourn this meeting to some other place.  --  Last words of Adam Smith , 1790 ON THE ROADThe federal government has been in transit since Warday . Though diminished in size , it is still a complex institution . Becausethe current President has not been legitimized by the ballot , he considers himself more a caretaker than a leader . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it would not be in keeping with his " custodial " role , as he described it . Acting President White is in office simply because he was vacationing at Key Largo on Warday , and had the good sense to stay there for a month rather than attempting to return to Washington . He was Undersecretary of the Treasury , and as such was the highest federal official to both survive the war and agree to serve as President . I have collected here a sampling of the sort of documents that might cross the President 's desk on a given day . They reflect , more than anything , a government trying to grapple with what happened to it , and to identify the direction of the future . There was resistance to my getting these documents . Even some recently appointed federal officials are nervous that there will eventually be trials . I think not . I suspect that the people are beyond placing the details of blame . When I found resistance to my requests , I reminded my contactsthat the government has a long tradition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right down to the painting of the few government cars with the exact L.A. motor-pooldesignations they would have had before the war , and the meticulous use of the old bureaucratic forms for every functional detail . These three documents are about the one effect of Warday that is hardest to grapple with  --  in a way , the most consistently surprisingeffect : radioactivity . It is what worries the acting President the most . CALIFORNIA DANGERS 181MEMORANDUMTO : CHARLES F. DURRELL , JR . Assistant to the President for Emergency War AffairsFROM : Winston SajidChairman , Committee on Long-Term Effects National Security AgencyDATE : 30 March 1992SUBJ : 12th Report on Atmospheric EffectsConcurrent studies by U.S. and United Kingdom task forces suggest a continuing deterioration of stratospheric conditions . Specifically , there has been an observed depletion or thinning of the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere . Studies conducted in the summer of 1988 have been used as a baseline measure . A full report on all aspects of atmospheric deterioration is complex , but for purposes of summary it can be reported that an overall depletion of approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be emphasized that while a further depletion might be expected in future years , it is not possible at this time to project a statistical trend with any certitude . Such a trend is difficult to predict because ( 1 ) little data were collected for approximately 18 months following the war , until atmospheric studies were resumed by the U.K. and other Western European nations ; and ( 2 ) such a dramatic change in ozone levels is unprecedentedand existing mathematical models are not sophisticated enough to consider all the variables . Data are presently being gathered to document the observed increases in skin cancers , increased propensities to skin " burns " and rashes , and the most significant ecological effects , such as the warming trends at the North and South poles , the disappearance of some subtropical vegetation , and the globaldepression in crop production. 182 WARDAYAt this time , the American-based U.K. atmospheric teams are preparing a series of high-altitude rocket surveys , as well as completing , with the University of Tokyo 's Atmospheric Research Laboratory , a multivariate computer model designed to calculate long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this Agency has had a chance in the next six months to review the results of these studies . CALIFORNIA DANGERS 183C O N F I D E N T I A L REPORT TO THE PRESIDENTPROJECTED LONG-TERM RADIATION EFFECTS AS A RESULTOF THE OCTOBER 1988 WARPREPARED BY THE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORYDECEMBER 7 , 1992EXECUTIVE SUMMARYOn December 1 , 1992 , the Livermore National Laboratory completed a six-month effort to assess existing studies on the long-term radiation effects of the October 1988 war . Data from this study were then used to calculate the somatic and genetic effects that can be expected over the next 35 to 40 years . Using information from European and Japanese sources , the study was also able to assess long-term radiation effects on areas ( 1 ) outside of the United States affected by fallout , and ( 2 ) within the Soviet Union as a result of the American counterattack . BACKGROUND OF THE ATTACKThe Soviet attack in October 1988 was directed against three urbancenters ( New York , Washington , D.C. , and San Antonio , Texas ) and against the operational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Western states ( Montana , Wyoming , North Dakota , and South Dakota ) . It is believed that some 300 + megatons ( MT ) of effective yield were realized in this attack . The Soviets employed a strategy against urban centers of detonating their weapons at a height of some 7,000 feet , which was clearly intended to heighten the range of destruction . Against military targets they employed a mixed strategy of airburstsagainst airbases and groundbursts against hardened missilesilos . Airbursts and groundbursts above cities appear to have averaged some 10 MT each . It should be remembered that impacted areas remain highly radioactive for a period of time , although considerable radioactivedecay will occur within the first 30 days . Fallout , how-184 WARDAYever , continues over an extended period of time . While lethal doses of radiation may not occur , sublethal doses have been common ; most of this fallout , sufficient to have caused considerableinjury , was material deposited in the troposphere and brought down to earth over a period of weeks , largely by rain . Some fallout was placed into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a period of years . Radioactive elementssuch as strontium 90 and carbon 14 have particularly long lives and pose the greatest danger over the long term . Our projections for long-term radiation effects are perhapsmost affected by the fallout of these dangerous elements . PROJECTED LONG-TERM EFFECTS FROM RADIATIONGiven the nature of the Soviet attack , the targets , calculated MY yield , and existent and projected fallout , the following somaticand genetic effects can be anticipated in the United States alone over the next 35-40 years : SOMATIC EFFECTSCancer deaths 3,000,000Thyroid cancers 2,000,000Thyroid nodules 3,000,000GENETIC EFFECTSAbortions due tochromosomal damage 1,500,000Other genetic effects 4,500,000These same effects , considered for the Northern Hemisphere ( concentrated between 30 degrees and 60 degrees North Latitude ) for the same time period , are as follows : SOMATIC EFFECTSCancer deaths 1,500,000Thyroid cancers 1,400,000Thyroid nodules 2,000,000CALIFORNIA DANGERS 185GENETIC EFFECTSAbortions due tochromosomal damage 850,000Other genetic effects 3,000,000The estimated effects on the Soviet Union as a result of the American attack , over the same time period , are as follows : SOMATIC EFFECTSCancer deaths 1,500,000Thyroid cancers 2,500,000Thyroid nodules 3,600,000GENETIC EFFECTSAbortions due tochromosomal damage 1,750,000Other genetic effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individualskilled either during the attack or shortly thereafter. 188 WARDAYPRESIDENTIAL BRIEFING PAPERNational Security CouncilCommittee on Long-Term Radiation EffectsAugust 27 , 1992The Committee on Long-Term Radiation Effects was asked by the ExecutiveOffice on August 1 , 1992 , to prepare a summary of information available on the physiological and related socio-psychological effects observed to date in victims of the nuclear bombings of 1988 , especially on those effects caused by or related to radiation . Further , we were asked to report wherever possible on data for both the United States and the Soviet Union . Unfortunately , scientific information is largely unavailablefrom the Soviet Union . Secondary observations from visiting European teams suggest , however , that long-term trends observed here in the United States are generally comparable to trends believed to existin the USSR . It is not the intention of this summary report to describe political developments , as more complete studies of the subject are available from other government agencies . The Committee wishes to stress from the outset that while this report summarizes a considerable body of evidence , based on classic prewar studies as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major trends are reported here . Contemporary studies , for example , have been conducted only during the last three years , althoughsome five years have passed since Warday . It must be noted that the full , long-term consequences of massive radiation dosages cannotbe known completely at this time ; this is particularly true of genetic effects . As requested , this report will address presently observed trends in physiological/genetic injuries caused by war-related radiation exposure . Where appropriate , however , related socio-psychological effects also will be described . It is important to note that these data describe only survivors of the attack. 1.1 NEOPLASMSThe single most dramatic trend observed to date is in the inordinate number of radiation-induced neoplasms , or cancers , from some 30 percentnationwide before the war to almost 6,0 percent today . Studies conducted by the National Centers for Disease Control in the WashingCALIFORNIADANGERS 187ton , D.C. , zone , and by the joint American-British Radiation Effects Teams in the South Texas zone , provide the most comprehensive evidence to date that perhaps as much as 9,0 percent of the affected populationsin both zones suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , depending upon radiation dosage ( both short and cumulative ) , more than 60 percent have experienced malignantneoplastic diseases . Skin tumors are perhaps the most common , followed by lung , stomach , breast , and ovary/reproductive organs . The prewar cancer rate for the entire population , excluding cancer of the skin , was perhaps 3,0 percent ; of that population , some 15  --  18 percent died . Exposure to radiation at the 15,0  --  2,0,0-rem level , however , effectivelydoubles the rate of cancer . Studies conducted after Warday suggestthat more than half of the population in or near bombed areas Suffered rem exposures at the 35,0  --  5,0,0 level . Aerial surveys of the Texas and New York zones suggest that individuals as far away as 2.5 miles from GZ Ground Zero experienced exposure levels of 100  --  150 rems . Those individuals two miles from GZ probably received exposuresin the 5,00-rem level . Demographic correlates , therefore , suggest that in these two urban zones alone , more than 35 million persons experiencedradiation levels sufficient to cause cancer . Correcting for those killed instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 15 million persons have now , or can be expected to have , malignancies . Related to the dramatic rise in cancer rates is the substantial rise in leukemia , of which granulocytic leukemia is perhaps the most frequently observed . Consequently , there has been a dramatic rise in related blood diseases . While cancer and leukemia represent the most dramatic radiationdiseasetrends , it must be remembered that radiation fundamentally attacksthe cellular system of the body . This occurs because ionizing radiation creates changes in individual cells . When sufficient changes occur , the individual organ ceases to function properly . Cells of differenttypes , and therefore different organs , have varying levels of radiosensitivity . Consequently , all of the following organs are susceptible , in descending order of sensitivity :  --  lymphoid tissue and bone marrow  --  epithelial tissues , such as the ovaries and testes and the skin  --  blood vessels  --  smooth and striated muscles  --  differentiated nerve cellsWARDAYNerves in general are the most resistant to radioactivity , although the nerves of embryos and of the adult cerebellum are exceptions and are quite sensitive. 1.2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also has increased markedly . These cataracts are similar to those reported in cases where individuals have experienced an overexposure to X-rays or gamma radiation . Fast neutrons are generally regarded as the primarysource of this disease . It is suspected that cataracts of the type observedare caused by exposure to radiation dosages of 3,11 rems or more . Although firm data are not available , extrapolations of observed sample populations suggest that between 12 and 15 percent of the population , or ten million persons , have or will develop radiation-induced cataracts . It is not known at this time what percentage will require surgical treatment. 1.3 SKIN DISEASESSkin diseases , in addition to the neoplasms described above , are largelyrelated to radiation burns , usually caused by beta particles . Skin diseasescaused by fallout can be from beta and/or gamma radiation . Diseases of this sort range from sensations of " burning ' ' to skin discoloration , lesions , ulcers , formation of keloids , or overgrowths of scar tissue , epilation or baldness , and atrophied limbs or whole portions of body surfaces . Again , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed samples suggest that some 75 million persons are or can be expected to be infected with varying degrees of skin diseases . It is important to note that the substantial areas of the United States still designated Dead , Red , or Orange Zones for their varying radiation levels almost certainly guarantee a continuing population of afflicted individuals . Those populations located adjacent to radioactive zones come into contact regularly with objects or contaminants of one kind or another that either engender first-time exposures or form part of the cumulativeexposure so frequently reported by local and regional medical centers . Radioactive foodstuffs are a continuing source of contamination , as are objects " looted " from restricted or forbidden areas . The greatest single source of ' ' new " radiation , however , is that dropped by atmospheric fallout . Fission products such as cesium 137 ( half-life of 3,0.5 years ) , strontium 9,0 ( half-life of 27.7 years ) , and carbon 14 ( halfCALIFORNIADANGERS 1 ; , life of 5,76 ; 0 years ) are perhaps the most important contributors to longtermradioactive exposures . Their effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal systems are unknown and thereforemerit close medical study. 1.4 GENETIC ALTERATIONSIt is well documented that exposure to radiation in measurable amounts causes changes in the hereditary components of reproductive cells . Observationsof nuclear industry workers , as well as of the victims of World War 11 atomic bombings , confirm these effects in future generations . However , none of these prewar populations were exposed to such high and continuing levels of radiation as have been the populationsof the United States and the Soviet Union . Genetic mutations have been noted in both countries and in adjacent countries where radioactivityis present through fallout in abnormal counts . The process of genetic alteration is very complex and beyond the scope of this report . Full implications of genetic changes are not known and will not be known for multiple generations , although some ten millionpeople in the United States are expected to be affected during the next 25  --  35 years . The following observations , however , serve to illustratethe extreme changes that have already occurred . Until extensive studies are completed , it is impossible to differentiate between those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rems , for example ) and changes caused by higher levels of exposure ( 251 to 500 rems ) . Also , it is presently impossible to understand the differing effectsof radiation absorbed all at once or cumulatively , in terms of resultantgeneratic alterations . In summary , then , the following genetic trends have been observed in individuals exposed to varying levels of radiation :  --  increased rates of sterility of 65 percent  --  increased rates of abortions caused by chromosomal damage of 27 percent  --  increased rates of stillbirths to 35 out of every 1,0,0 births  --  increased rates of children born with physical handicaps of 57 per-cent  --  specific increase of 32 percent in frequency of children born with varying levels of mental retardation  --  increased rate of 28 percent in infant deaths  --  increased rates of 25-30 percent of chronic susceptibility to disease in young children born after Warday , especially to respiratory and cardiac diseases170 WARDAY1.5 NONSPECIFIC SCLEROSING SYNDROMEWhile not necessarily induced by radiation exposure , Nonspecific SclerosingDisease , or NSD , is noted more frequently in individuals , and in populations as a whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contaminated areas . Early symptoms include parched skin , mostly on the chest or abdomen , and the development of lumpy swellings over the surface of the body . Lack of appetiteor anorexia follows , often complicated by difficulty in breathing . Eventually there is a collapse of the internal organs . Very little is known about NSD . The origin of the disease and its etiology are little understood . It is perhaps trauma-related , although individuals almost always have had exposure to radiation above 1,0,0 rems . There appears to be no treatment at this time , and the fatality rate varies between 7,0 and 10,0 percent among those who contract it. 1.6 . GENERALThere is a whole family of medical conditions related to the shock and trauma associated with nuclear war . Much has been written about the broad sociological changes that have occurred in the last five years , especially regarding individual and societal perceptions of national and international government , long-term security , possibilities for internationalaccord , and fundamental changes in relationships between individualsat all levels of society . This report , however , is concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child and adult populations there is a marked increase in general susceptibility to disease . No doubt this susceptibility is influenced by stress , lack of suitable diet or caloric intake , and depressed metabolic levels . Continuing unsanitary conditions in or near War Zones are another major contributor to high levels of illnesses such as influenzaand dysentery . There is an increase in the number of persons displaying high levels of depression , dysphoria , unprovoked fears , etc . Also , there is an increase in the number of persons exhibiting pronouncedand chronic shock and disorientation . In some cases this condition , if severe enough , produces abnormal and often violent reactions to ordinary stimuli . It is estimated that some 1,0-15 million persons exhibitpermanent disorientation . It is believed that this condition is a majorfactor in the large nomadic sub-populations that live on the fringes of the War Zones . It should be mentioned here that a considerable portion of the populationdemonstrates varying degrees of phobic reactions to real or imagined radiation . There is a very pervasive fear of radioactive conCALIFORNIADANGERS 171tamination , which has led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This abnormal fear is present even in " safe " areas such as California and the Northwestern states . Other conditions , also believed to be trauma-induced , include marked increases in the reported rates of impotence , baldness , and a range of " sympathetic " ailments in individuals with little or no exposure to radiation . SUMMARYLess than five years have passed since Warday . While the full long-term implications of radioactivity are not known with certainty , sufficient trends have emerged to provide a disturbing portrait of surviving Americansociety . The Committee recognizes that while the full effects of nuclearwar are many , it is clear that the United States will have as a major concern , for many decades to come , the treatment of radiationrelateddiseases . Both the Executive and Legislative branches of government should place their highest priority on the care and treatment of those members of the population who have suffered , or will suffer , the lasting effects of this war .

Coast Daylight to San FranciscoThe Super Chief , the Broadway Limited , the Twentieth Century  --  theselegendary trains came to mind as the sparkling Coast Daylight left Union Station and picked up speed past the Los AngelesCounty Jail . Soon we were heading toward Santa Barbara and the north . We were on a super deluxe train  --  or at least in the super deluxepart of it , in a beautifully refurbished Superliner observation car . It was decorated in tan , with luxurious club-style seating and a view of the California coast so spectacular that we almost missed the appetizer tray . " Father , " the tan-uniformed waiter said , leaning forward to present me with an array of shrimp , oysters , crab claws , and raw vegetables to go with my Bloody Mary . These wonders were part of the ticket price  --  a hefty eleven dollars . Lunch in the spacious and spotless dining car behind us was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken the roses on the table , had we wanted them . Also included , as it turned out , was conversation with Mr. Tanaka , a Japanese rail official , who happened to be sitting beside us , watching the passing view of the ocean . On our train trip to Needles , people had not been willing to talk much . But that was another world . Those were refugees ; here in  --  CALIFORNIA DANGERS 178the first-class section of the Coast Daylight were the new prime movers , and they were not afraid to speak their minds . " This train 's barely doing sixty , " Mr. Tanaka scoffed , apparentlyhis way of starting a conversation . " How do you know that ? " Jim asked . I saw him turn on his recorder . " Simple . Each rail is thirty-three feet long . Each click ' you hear means one rail . I count the number of clicks over sixty seconds and thus calculate the train 's speed . " " Are you a trainman ? " Mr. Tanaka gave Jim a card that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1130 SUNLAND BUILDING , LOS ANGELES . " I 'm Father William , " Jim said . " This is Father Brown . " We exchanged handshakes . " What 's a Japanese railroad man doing here in California ? " I asked . " Ah , a great deal . This is the land of opportunity . Things need to be done here ! We 're working with your government to create the most modern train system in North America . L.A. to Oakland in an hour and twenty minutes , and that includes a five-minute stop in Bakersfield . How do you like that ? " " Extraordinary . " " It 's because of a revolutionary new transport system we call a magnetic-cushion tube train . Top cruising speed potential of five hundred miles an hour . Of course , this run is too short to reach that speed . But one day we 'll be going all the way to Seattle . Then you 'll see some speed . " " What about air travel ? Are n't planes coming back ? " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , we can move more people faster and with greater efficiency than the best airline in the world . Our energy costs are thirty percent less than the most efficient jet engines now under development back home . Planes can never compete . " " But all those miles of track  --  " " Prefabricated aboveground tunnel segments with magnetic cushions inside . Built in Japan very cheaply and shipped here for easy installation . The roadbed is a circular magnetic field in the tunnel . The train floats in it . Our cost per mile is about three mil-174 WARDAYlion gold , and if California ca n't get the money directly , it can find a way to obtain it from the Feds . " It seemed a lot to me . " This thing is creeping , " Tanaka scoffed . " Bullet trains do betterat home with dead birds on the windshields . " " How long have you been in the United States ? " " Since 1990 . I 've got my whole family here now . We bought a house in Beverly Hills last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Or maybe Theda Bara , we 're not sure . We are redoing the gardens and installing a complete computerized home security system . It 's lots of fun , because such huge houses are unobtainablein Japan . " " How do you find working here ? " " I love it ! There 's so much to be done . A whole new world is beingbuilt in this country , and it 's starting with California . " " Do you approve of California 's immigration policies ? " " Not my business . I 'm a foreigner . My interest is in getting people from place to place fast . I do n't care why they make their journeys . " " How about the rest of the country ? Have you done any travel-ing ? " " Well , Japan Air Lines operates an all-America tour , but we have n't taken it . I do n't want to fool around with radiation . " He lifted his left hand . Two of the fingers were grown together , a thick stump . " My mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The road can be very hard , " he said at last . " This we Japanese have learned . " After a moment he settled back , contemplating the black cliffs and the slow blue sea . Golden CityThe Daylight reached Oakland at 8:36 in the evening . As soon as we got off the train I went to a phone booth and called my one contactin the area , a writer named Quinn Yarbro , whom I had known before the war . Quinn wrote historical novels back when such things were popular . I have n't seen her name on anything in the Doubleday bookstorein Dallas in years , so I had no idea what had happened to her . There seemed to me a risk in using long distance in California , so I had delayed trying to call her until we were actually here . I dialed the last number I had for her . After five rings an older woman answered . " Yarbro Locators , " she said . " May I speak to Quinn , please ? " " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? This is Whitley . " " Oh God , where are you calling from ? " " Oakland . I just came up from L.A. I have a friend with me . We 're doing a book on America together . We 're here to see San Francisco . " " Whitley , this is  --  I mean , I 'm in the locating business , so I guess I should n't be surprised  --  but  --  " " I lived , Quinn . " 175176 WARDAY " Oh God , Whitley , I assumed  --  with you in New York and all . " " We 've been living in Dallas . Anne and Andrew too . " She told us to take the BART to Market and Powell in San Francisco . " I  --  well , I 'll wear something recognizable . If I must , a blue fedora . " " Quinn , we 're dressed like priests . " " Ah . Okay . Shall I expect to pray ? " " Just look for two middle-aged priests with backpacks . " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can forget the darned fedora . I 'll find you . " We traveled on BART for fifteen cents . The highest fare is a quarter , the lowest a penny . The trains are jammed and not particularlyfrequent , but they work . Like so many things in California , much EMP-related damage sustained by BART has been repaired . There are ticket clerks , however , instead of computerized machines , and my impression was that the trains were directly controlled by their motormen rather than by a central computer . I noticed signal lights along the tracks much like those in the old New York subway system . Even past nine at night , the Powell Street station resounded with the footsteps of a swarming crowd . Like Los Angeles , the San Francisco area has sustained a massive population influx in the past few years  --  despite the efforts of the immigration police . " Hello , Father Whitley . " She was older , very much older . " Quinn . " There were tears at the corners of her eyes . Finding old friends alive hurts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears . I embraced Quinn . I touched her hair , which was still red but struck with gray . Her eyes , looking at me , were wide . Jim stood nearby , silent , not intruding , waiting . " Quinn , this is Jim Kunetka . " " Father Jim ? " " Simply Jim . This is a disguise . " " I 'm glad . You both look too thin to be priests . I 'd peg you as robbers . " " Is there much crime in California ? " Jim asked , ever the newsman . " More than before the war . People are so desperate . We have rich and poor and not much in between . " CALIFORNIA DANGERS 177 " It looks so good . " " It 's still got the best weather in the world , anyway . " " Quinn , we 're fugitives . " She laughed . " I gathered that . You want to get off the street ? " " Exactly . " She offered to put us up at her apartment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two cents each . There was an " I Stop at the St. Francis " sign on the front of the car , and the familiaryellow destination sign : Powell &; Market , Hyde &; Beach . We had to hang on all the way . The gripman was a master with his bell , and he needed to be  --  the streets were jammed with pedestrians . On the way , Quinn asked if we 'd eaten dinner . We had not . Lunch on the train had seemed sufficient for a month . I can remembervery long periods of my life without so much food . And the freshness of it was unforgettable , as was the menu : lima beans cooked in real butter , a thick lamb chop with the juice running in the plate , mashed potatoes with pan gravy , an endive salad , two different wines , and , for dessert , frozen pecan balls . It is no wonder that people are willing to risk prison to come to California . Despite the danger of the streets , we could not resist seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought at once of a certainrestaurant . " Dare I ask if Kan 's is still there ? " " Kan 's is still there . " We hopped off the cable car and went looking . Kan 's had not changed at all . The restaurant had opened in 1936 , and it retains the comfortable spaciousness of former times . If I was impressed by lunch on the train , I was delighted by dinner here , even though I could n't eat much . A stomach used to a simpler diet can not adjust quickly to the richness of California food . In a way , being at Kan 's made me sad . Anne and I had taken five days in San Francisco in the summer of ' 87 . Andrew was at camp and we flew out for the chance to be alone together , to see a few good friends , to enjoy the city . It was our last vacation , and we had our last meal in San Francisco at Kan 's . Over dinner , the three of us traded lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had an idea . " I know a man you 'll want to interview . If you 're trying to understand things , he's178 WARDAYsomebody who probably knows . He 's an economist , and he teaches at Berkeley . He 's also somebody I love . He 'll be over to the apartment in the morning . You can meet him then . " Neither of us had heard of Dr. Walter Tevis . I doubt , however , that we will ever forget him . I asked her what she was doing . " I 'm a gumshoe , " she said . " A what ? " " A detective . " Jim went pale . I was stunned . It was n't possible that we were in the hands of the police . " I 'm not a cop , " she said , " so you can redirect some blood into your faces . I find lost people . I 'll try to locate anybody you 're missing . If I succeed , I get a fee . " " You must be incredibly busy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned forward . " My wife  --  I lost her in Austin right after Warday . " His face was suddenly sharp , his eyes boring into Quinn 's . " Give me her name and description and last known address . I 'll see what I can do . It might take some time , you understand . " Jim gave her the information . After dinner she took us to her apartment , on a hidden Russian Hill byway called Keys Alley . " I warn you , I still have cats , " she said as she let us into the single cluttered room . A huge red furball came up and began protesting . The room was jammed with the tools of her trade . There were stacks of old telephone books from dozens of cities , city directories , maps , old newspapers , census tracts , Zip Code directories , copies of birth certificates in lettered stacks , card files and Rolodexesidentified by colored tags , and hundreds and hundreds of photographs in thick black albums . I could see how she carried out her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It must have been a frustrating and difficult job . " Sorry about the mess . " She sat down . She looked , then , very small and tired and somewhat lost herself . " A lot of people are missing , " she said . Jim and I slept on the floor . Just as I was dropping off , the catCALIFORNIA DANGERS 178woke me by flopping down on my face . I moved it aside and sat up . The little room was quiet . Quinn was a shadow on her couch . On the table beside her was a Princess telephone attached to an answeringmachine whose power lamp glowed red . I wondered how she managed . She must be besieged with clients . Names and names and names . A trapped feeling came upon me and made me get up and put on my collar and my black suit and go out to get some night air . Keys Alley was silent , lit through the leaves of trees lining the street . Music drifted in the dark , a radio playing an old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me back to childhood summer nights , watching my bedroom curtains make shadows on the walls and listening to my parents and their friends talking in low voices under the trees outside , talking of the cares of forty years ago , Truman and the cost of the Marshall Plan and Stalin 's health . I stepped softly as I left the silent alley . I went up Pacific Street to the crest , then turned and looked down across the roofs of Chinatown to the Bay . The view is not one of San Francisco 's most spectacular , but it satisfied me . Far out in the Bay I heard foghorns beginning to sound above the subdued rumble of the city . The hour was late ; midnight had come and gone . Slowly , nearer horns started sounding . A fog was coming through the Golden Gate . Soon I could see it slipping up the streets and across the roofs , dulling lights , drawing the dark close around me . When it swirled up Pacific , cold and damp , transforming crisp night sounds to whispers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I returned to the stuffy little flat and the sounds of Quinn and Jim sleeping , and the cat purring . Sometime in the night the phone gave half a ring and the answeringmachine clicked . I heard a voice talking quickly into the recorder , quickly and endlessly , droning , filling my sleep with a tale of loss I no longer remember.
