On this , the troupe ' s 10th tour in the United States since 1958 , Mr. Grigorovich intends to show how far the Bolshoi has gone - and how far he believes it can go - in reinventing itself . There will be a new version of " Raymonda " - " completely different , " Mr. Grigorovich said . There will be new costumes and set designs for " Giselle . " Most importantly , there will be , for the first time in the United States , a production of " The Golden Age , " Mr. Grigorovich ' s distinctive revival of the Dmitri Shostakovich work ; it highlights the muscular magnetism of the Bolshoi ' s latest star , Irek Mukhamedov. // " The Golden Age , " which drew highly favorable reviews in London last year and a more mixed reaction in Paris , puts more than 80 dancers on stage in a Socialist allegory with a Roaring Twenties rhythm . In it , Shostakovich ' s music is interspersed with offerings like " Tea for Two " and lyrical pas de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and corkscrew twists , executed by Mr. Mukhamedov at the peak of his startlingly high jumps . The 27-year-old Tatar , whose movements are touched with a panther ' s feral grace and whose leaps are a breathtaking exhibition of controlled power , is the latest in the line of dynamic male dancers brought to prominence by Mr. Grigorovich ' s predominately male-oriented choreography . Mr. Mukhamedov leads a group of dancers , including two second-generation Bolshoi principals , most of whom are new to New York audiences . The company ' s June 30 appearance will be its first here since 1979 , the year that marked the collapse of detente. // Mr. Mukhamedov and the rest of the generation that has come to flower in the ensuing eight years are outward symbols of the 211-year-old Bolshoi ' s resilience and perpetual regeneration , just as " The Golden Age , " with its cabaret theme and controversial reintroduction of acrobatics into the vocabulary of dance , is a symbol of Mr. Grigorovich ' s willingness to look for fresh choreographic approaches. // Symbols of change , in choreography and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now . For , according to people familiar with the ballet world here , the artistic director is again under attack by influential critics . Their handiest weapon is the oft-repeated charge that Mr. Grigorovich ' s single-minded reverence for the classical tradition and disdain for new directions in dance have smothered the creative life of his troupe. // " He continues to believe that the classical school is the only valuable school and classical dance the only worthwhile dance , " says one Soviet ballet expert . Works like " The Golden Age , " the expert adds , do make new use of once-popular techniques such as acrobatic dance , but they are Mr. Grigorovich ' s own innovations and , critics say , draw little on the legacies of more innovative latter-day choreographers. // While Mr. Grigorovich emphasized - for an audience of American diplomats and journalists - the changes in the Bolshoi ' s repertory , his comments in recent Soviet press interviews show far more of his classical inclinations. // " To me , it is important to preserve the foundations on which stood - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Grigorovich said in an interview recently published in the trade union newspaper Trud . " A repertory is not rubber . It can not be stretched endlessly . " For us , " he added , " culture is , above all , memory. " // For the Bolshoi Ballet , " memory " means a tradition of more than two centuries , with superb technical training of dancers being a staple of the company and , until the second and third decades of the 20th century , with the needs of dance taking precedence over the needs of drama. // It is this tradition - temporarily abandoned in the years after the 1917 revolution , when pantomime and drama became primary - to which Mr. Grigorovich adheres , offering for the most part a form of dance that is both classical and monumental. // In the process of building the company ' s repertory around such staples as " Swan Lake , " " Giselle " and his own " Raymonda " and " Spartacus , " Mr. Grigorovich has also revived another Bolshoi tradition : personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Mr. Grigorovich ' s alleged rigidity has broken the surface , first with the defections of Bolshoi dancers like Aleksandr Godunov in 1979 and then with the publication here in 1981 of a book , " Divertissement , " by the Soviet ballet critic Vadim Gayevsky. // After lauding Mr. Grigorovich ' s early career , the book ' s author juxtaposed criticism of Mr. Grigorovich ' s later works - specifically , the 1979 " Romeo and Juliet " - with a subsequent essay hailing George Balanchine ' s innovations . That juxtaposition and the few pages of open criticism of a previously unassailable institution made " Divertissement " an informal watershed . The book sold out and never reappeared . But the furor it sparked has never entirely died down. // This spring , rumors about Mr. Grigorovich ' s possible departure from the Bolshoi became intense , as did stories of an open revolt that is said to have taken place during a meeting of the ballet company . But the rumors faded , and Mr. Grigorovich remained , the company ' s repertory and direction still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars seen as his chief rivals - Maya Plisetskaya and his former acolyte , Vladimir Vasiliev - also remained in their roles as sometime dancers and choreographers at the Bolshoi. // Recently , despite repeated requests for an interview , Mr. Grigorovich made himself available only once - in a single , group news conference late last month to discuss the changes in his company over the past eight years . During this news conference , Mr. Grigorovich freely discussed the troupe ' s new works and new stars , the renovations that will be done on the 162-year-old theater when it closes next winter for several years ( the company will perform at the Palace of Congresses near the Kremlin and at another , smaller Moscow theater ) and the new system of using the Bolshoi ' s smaller " filial " stage to try out experimental works. // But when the questioning touched on other subjects - Mr. Grigorovich ' s receptiveness to incorporating the innovation of other choreographers or the new push for limited democracy in theatrical enterprises - he grew defensive and sarcastic . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can ' t find ballets in tune with our young dancers , " he remarked bitingly at one point. // Despite all the ferment , the last eight years have also been a time of awakening at the company , with fully established ballerinas like Natalya Bessmertnova , Mr. Grigorovich ' s wife , continuing to shine while not obscuring such comparatively new faces as Nina Semizorova , Alla Mikhalchenko , Lyudmila Semenyaka and Nina Ananiashvili , the 23-year-old from Soviet Georgia who took a gold medal in the international ballet competition in Jackson , Miss. , last year. // Ms. Ananiashvili and her frequent partner , Andris Liepa , are regarded by critics here as continuing the tradition of classical style and technical mastery that have become part of the Bolshoi ' s legend . Mr. Liepa and another principal , Aleksei Fadeyechev , are sons of the renowned male principals Maris Liepa and Nikolai Fadeyechev . While not as electric as Mr. Mukhamedov , they are part of the company ' s tradition of elegance and nobility. // But if these dancers are part of the Bolshoi ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grigorovich ' s more personal tradition that has given rise to such ballets as " Spartacus , " which had its premiere in 1968 , and " Ivan the Terrible , " which was first shown 12 years ago . The 1982 version of " The Golden Age , " the ballet that Mr. Mukhamedov brings roaring to life , resurrects a work to Shostakovich ' s music that had been condemned to oblivion for almost half a century. // Set in a cabaret called the Golden Age , the ballet is a morality play with a sense of fun , mingling colloquial 1920 ' s music with more somber Shostokovich piano concertos . It is also a love story with a fine Soviet hero , the Crimean fisherman Boris , and an insidiously appealing capitalist villain , Yashka . The role of Rita , the fisherman ' s new-found love , is most frequently danced by Ms. Bessmertnova. // Mr. Mukhamedov , as the fisherman , comes onstage as if shot from a cannon , using a melange of dance and acrobatics that recalls the long-dormant Russian dance vocabulary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of acrobatics in dance , " says one Moscow ballet critic and historian. // It is a language that has not found favor with all critics , either here or in the West , who disparage the movements as " tricks " worthy of a circus , not a stage . But Mr. Mukhamedov responds : " It is dance . Tricks are in the circus - they do them and that is that . In the ballet , you have to do the jump while dancing at the same time . It is not a trick . " " The most difficult thing for the ballerina is the element of acrobatics , " said Ms. Mikhalchenko . " They are very interesting but physically very hard . Ballerinas had never done these things before ' The Golden Age . ' One has to pass through circus training to dance all that. " // Mr. Mukhamedov adds : " The genius of Grigorovich is that he can create an ensemble . He does not make you do what he wants . While there is contact between you and him , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The choreography is Grigorovich , but the inner emotions are ours , prompted by Grigorovich. " // In addition to " The Golden Age , " " Raymonda " and " Giselle , " the four-city , nine-week Bolshoi tour will offer a " concert program , " including the first act of Mr. Grigorovich ' s " Romeo and Juliet , " the second act of " Spartacus " and a divertissement. // All the works have been seen outside the Soviet Union , many on recent Bolshoi tours to London and Paris . In London last summer , ballet critics reacted with general acclaim to " The Golden Age " and to Mr. Mukhamedov ' s electricity , emotion and sheer physical prowess . The set and costume designs for " The Golden Age , " done by the Bolshoi designer Simon Virsaladze , were also lauded for offering a suitably slinky re-creation of night life at the seamy edge of capitalism. // While Mr. Grigorovich and the troupe tour , rumors about feuds within the Bolshoi hierarchy will undoubtedly continue . The leaders of the two factions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 61-year-old prima ballerina and choreographer , and Mr. Vasiliev , the 48-year-old former principal dancer - will not be along on the trip . Like Mr. Grigorovich , who on his 60th birthday in January was awarded the title of " hero of the Soviet Union , " these two stars - who have achieved the official designation of " people ' s artists of the Soviet Union " - are assumed to have some backing in the country ' s cultural bureaucracy , allowing them to prolong their opposition from within the company. // The crossfire between these two and Mr. Grigorovich , however , can be read between the lines of articles in the Soviet press focusing on the troupe . For instance , in the Trud piece in early January , Mr. Grigorovich raised the issue on which Ms. Plisetskaya and Mr. Vasiliev are most vulnerable - their advanced age. // " Bolshoi soloists are stars of world stature , " Mr. Grigorovich said . " At times , it seems to them that their strength is inexhaustible . But , of course , this is not the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , free an artist from the repetory that is better ' held ' by young performers. " // During the Bolshoi ' s upcoming tour , however , it will be the onstage performances that are at issue and not the backstage politics . And , as the troupe goes from New York to Washington to San Francisco and Los Angeles , the fireworks of " The Golden Age " and the applause for the rocket named Mukhamedov are likely to drown out all sounds of discord . <> <> DEFINING BALLET // Here is a sampling of some recent pronouncements in the Soviet press by Yuri Grigorovich , artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet . On the Bolshoi itself : " When talking of the Bolshoi , one must always have in mind its special status . It is a theater of world renown . . . . We experiment , of course , but we are inevitably limited by the requirements of our high responsibility. " // On the classical-versus-modern debate : // " Classical and modern dance do not stand in opposition to one another . As far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a modern style , do not experience creative difficulties . I myself am a ballet-master in the classical mold , although I freely use various techniques. " // " The times change , and people with them - they come to a new sense of rhythm and tempo , a new understanding of beauty . I would not want to be the one to set the classical and the modern up against one another , or do the same with experiment and tradition - not now or in the future . An ' antagonistic ' approach to choreography bodes ill for progress . It takes us away from the most important question : Is a ballet good or bad ? " //
