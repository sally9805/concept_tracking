txt Q  --  Something baffles me about the Chicago Transit Authority . Why did they spend the time , effort , and money to put up guardrails around the Main Street Elevated station in Evanston ? To protect the grass ? Why do n't they fix the automatic turnstiles so passengers would n't have to wait in line ? When I have exact change as they ask , I ca n't use the fareboxes and must writ with dosens of other commuters for one cashier . The fareboxes are now boarded up . They stationed an extra fare-taker , but he 's not there anymore . is this the only station that has done this ? It 's really frustrating to stand in line and see two or three trains go by , even though I have exact change . Service Is bad enough , fares are incredible , but is this necessary ? S. Kelley , Evanston A ? " The older turnstiles at this station , " C. W. Baxa of the CTA said , " and at some others , are not equipped to handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I.D . checks , or various transfers . That is why these turnstiles are closed . The CTA 's Operations Planning Depart . ment is working on modifications for these older-model turnstiles with plans for retrofitting them in the near future . Your complaint about long waiting lines caused by one ticket agent being on duty has been referred to our General Opera . tions Division . The wrought-iron fence was installed by an Evanston civic group . No CTA funds were involved . The fence once stood at the northwest corner of Chicago Avenue and Sheridan Road . ' ; Q  --  Every time a Jet bound for O'Hsre goes over my house , my garage door opens . My garage was built in August by Union Garages , 1440 W. North Av. , Melrose Park . For an extra $120 they gave me an automatic door opener with one control . ( 2 was supposed to receive two ) . Of course , I called the company and was told that they were having trouble with the frequency of the opener and the planes . I was promised that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change the frequency . That was awhile ago . Louis Kann : , North Kedvale Avenue A  --  Union Industries ' Ken Frye said , " Inasmuch as we can not control the signal a jet airplane transmits , we have agreed to leave the automatic opener as it is , and submit a refund . " You already should have a refund check from the firm for $120 , which , you said , will go toward the purchase of another opener with a different frequency . Thus ends this " open and shut " case . Sound off In making out my 1980 Income tax return , I claimed a loss due to a burglary in which my father 's watch was taken . This watch was very old , possibly brought with him when he left Europe for the States at the age of 15 or 16 . I had been offered $400 for it . I was called in regarding this claim on my tax return , and I was told that I could not claim this as a loss because I could not prove it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the policeman who came and took a list of what was stolen , namely other Jewelry and money . But the only article the examiner questioned was the watch . I sure would rather have the watch back , not the allowance on my IBS form .
