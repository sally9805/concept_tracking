 | AC/DC . AM/FM . The double-gaited set . The nicknames have always been a little nasty . One view commonly held by therapists and gay activists is that bisexuals are merely self-deceived homosexuals , " fence sitters " unwilling to face up to their same-sex preference . Heterosexuals tend to think of " bi 's " as the ultimate libertines , the ones most determined to " have it all . " As one bisexual once put it , " Why should we be restricted from sleeping with half the human race ? " There is now a very short answer to that question , a four-letter word that explains why bisexuals are becoming the ultimate pariahs of the ' 80s . That word is AIDS . Very little is known about the numbers and habits of bisexuals ? especially males who keep their dual activities secret from Female lovers . But the available evidence suggests that these male bi 's could represent a new dimension in the deadly epidemic . Many doctors consider them among the most likely potential conduits for the spread of AIDS to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens , marry them , never suspecting that their partners are leading a dangerous double love life . So far , there has been no evidence that bisexuals are passing the disease from the gay to the straight community at anything like an overwhelming rate . About 2 to 3 percent of AIDS patients are women thought to have contracted the disease from male lovers , and some of those men were intravenous-drug users . But the fears about bisexuals are not unfounded . In theory , bisexual husbands and bachelors can spread the infection that ultimately afflicts their wives and children , or their straight girlfriends , who in turn may infect other boyfriends . Bedroom behavior : How many bisexuals are out there ? No major study of sexual mores has been undertaken since Alfred C. Kinsey published his landmark survey of ( white ) male and female bedroom behavior in 1948 and ' 53 . Rather than work from fixed categories , Kinsey posited a **26;932;TOOLONG scale of 0 to 6 , with the lower number indicating undiluted heterosexuality and the higher one signifying extreme " gayness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 5 . The survey also found that 18 percent of males were equally involved with men and women for at @# @# least three years between the ages of 16 and 55 , and an additional 13 percent tended to be more homosexual than heterosexual . For women , the figures were about half those of men . On the subject of bisexuals in the era of AIDS , however , Dr. June Reinisch , the current director of the Kinsey Institute , says simply that " we do n't have enough data . " Researchers are only now beginning to get some hint of the size of the bisexual population because of the growing numbers coming in for help after testing positive for the AIDS antibodies . In Minnesota , the Department of Health estimates 35 percent of the state 's AIDS cases are bisexual men . In Chicago , health officials say the chances that a bisexual man will be exposed to AIDS may soon approach the 50-50 mark . It is clear from those scattered studies that most bisexual men are probably still undercover , agonizing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of organizational ties ? and their fear of losing their wives and children ? may make them the hardest to reach of the potential AIDS-carrying groups . Says June Osborn , dean of the University of Michigan School of Public Health : " These people are not going to come forward under any circumstances . " We are just beginning to understand how bisexuality develops . Sigmund Freud believed firmly in " the original bisexuality of the individual . " We all begin with the bisexual potential , he wrote . As children , we are " polymorphous perverse , " knowing no sexual barriers . Where we go from there may depend on the quality of relations with the male or female parent , or other early objects of love . In the decades since the founder of psychoanalysis first put forth those ideas , we have learned that like some homosexuals . bisexual men frequently report having had distant , unsympathetic fathers . " James , " a Louisiana civic leader who had his first homosexual experience three years after he married , recalls feeling insufficiently loved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratification with partners he picked up in bathhouses and service-station lavatories , continuing a double life for 12 years until his wife found out and issued an ultimatum . James thinks he was acting partly in rage against his father . " I remember gritting my teeth a lot , " he says . Emotions and romance : Not all bisexuals harbor such feelings . Francis Giambrone , a Boston psychotherapist who says he has treated hundreds of bisexuals , divides them into three categories . " One type , " he says , " is the person who 's transitional ; he 's essentially gay but he needs to identify as a bisexual to come out to others . Then there are hundreds of men and women who are genuinely erotically and emotionally attracted to both sexes . " A third group , he @#  | adds , is drawn erotically to the same sex but emotionally to the opposite sex . Others agree that the emotional component is important in understanding the inner workings of people who find themselves attracted to both sexes . Bisexuality begins in the imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexes , be it of a romantic or sexual kind , " observes Manhattan-based therapist Bill Wedin . " There 's a problem in thinking of this exclusively in sexual terms when in fact it 's as much emotional and romantic as sexual . " For " Henry , " a New York therapist who treats many gay men , it was clearly both . Although he loved his second wife , he nevertheless found his erotic feelings for his own sex so powerful that for a time he engaged in anonymous , furtive homosexual encounters . Finally he told his wife , who did not want to lose him . The marriage survived , and he found a male lover with whom he formed such a strong attachment that he calls him a " second spouse . " Years later , he still divides his time between his two partners , who accept the arrangement . " I wanted a relationship with a man , " Henry explains . " It was not simply a sexual thing , not something that could be satisfied through an occasional one-night stand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely the expression . " The erotic factor alone can be overpowering . " Even faced with a miserable , awful death , the sex drive is a strong drive , " said one Washington , D.C. , man who resumed homosexual contacts after 30 years of heterosexual marriage . Despite all the public discussion about AIDS , male bisexuals tend to have multiple partners , sometimes engaging in sex without even speaking . Roadside rest areas have become a popular locale for cruising . " A man leaves his house to get the paper , has sex and returns to his wife , " says Gary Drake , a gay therapist in Brookline , Mass . Men and women bisexuals alike often talk of the " intense " arousal , the " different energy " they experience with their own sex . James remembers it as being " like sky diving . It was intoxicating , a high . " Many bisexuals seem reluctant or un- able to deny themselves the exotic other side of sex . The right to have it both ways was a recurring theme at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a weekend-long series of workshops in New York . The keynote speaker was Maggi Rubenstein , a 56-year-old nurse , counselor and mother of two grown children who is the duenna of San Francisco 's bisexual community . " I 'm proud to love both sexes , " says Rubenstein . " The world says you have to choose , but I never have . " Despite the generally self-assured tone of the conference , there was abundant evidence of the new uneasiness about AIDS . Along with a workshop on " Erotic Imagery " and " Bisexuality 101 , " there were such others as " The Joy of Safe Sex " and " Building Your Immune System . " AIDS consciousness is hitting bisexuals with increasing force . " These are tortured souls in a wretched situation , " says Dr. Thomas Wise of Fairfax Hospital in northern Virginia . " They have to make sure the wife is not infected and then risk the whole revelation of their other life . " Doctors first try to help such patients discuss the AIDS test with their wives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the two through couples therapy . But " when the wife is infected , too , we also have to deal with her rage , " Wise adds . If both partners are infected and they have young children , the situation becomes even more tragic . He imagines worse scenarios : a young bride unknowingly infected by a bisexual boyfriend before she married , for example , who then infects her husband and , at the same time , becomes pregnant , posing a threat to the unborn child . Sex therapy : Faced with such horror stories , more bisexuals are seeking to change . Dr. Mark Schwartz , a Masters and Johnson consultant who runs a sex-therapy clinic in New Orleans , says that in the past year he has been overwhelmed by bisexuals hoping to go " straight , " among them , doctors , lawyers and " high officials . " He claims a 70 percent success rate with such patients . Such claims of success in altering sexual orientation are hotly disputed . Many people in the psychiatric community believe that an individual 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There 's no evidence at all that the object of desire has ever been changed by any form of treatment , " says Michael Shernoff , a New York therapist . " What therapists consider a success is changing who patients can function @# NEWSWEEK : JULY 13 , 1987 45  | with , not who they are aroused by . " Therapists who work with bisexuals are advocating , if not change , at least " openness . " If bisexuals have no choice , they argue , then at least their partners should have one . Bisexuals are increasingly coming to terms with that obligation . Arlene Krantz , a 47-year-old mother of two who lives in San Francisco , says that even though there are almost no known cases of lesbians transmitting AIDS to each other , she now tells any prospective partner she is bisexual and whether she is currently involved in a relationship . " I expect the same in return , " she says . " We are talking about life and death , not some little disease . " Some bisexuals stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are celebrating themselves in gay-pride parades and protesting the attitude of straights and gays alike ? that coolness that often makes bisexuals feel , says Robyn Ochs , who cofounded a women 's bisexual support group in Boston , " that you do n't exist at all . " Any thaw in relations is not likely to happen in the current climate . though ? not so long as many straights and gays are discussing AIDS candidly with their partners while bisexual men often do n't tell the truth ? even to themselves .
