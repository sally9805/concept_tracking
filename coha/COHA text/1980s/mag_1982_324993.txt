As Red Brigades talk , their terrorist network begins to unravel <P> Police with submachine guns ringed Verona 's 12th century Palazzo della Ragione while helicopters whirred overhead and sharpshooters kept a vigil from nearby rooftops . Inside , seven of the 16 Red Brigades terrorists accused of kidnaping U.S. Brigadier General James L. Dozier awaited the first day of their trial in two adjoining steel cages . In one were the duri ( hard-liners ) , who have stubbornly maintained their silence during interrogation . In the other , for their own protection as much as anything else , were the pentiti ( repentant ones ) , whose surprising willingness to betray their comrades has given Italian authorities reason to believe that they may be close to unraveling the once tight Red Brigades terrorist network . <P> The first major break came on Jan. 4 , just 18 days after Dozier 's kidnaping , when police picked up two suspected terrorists near Rome 's Spanish Steps . The arrests led to raids on apartments that yielded documents containing a gold mine of information on hideouts , action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than 375 suspected left-wing terrorists have been arrested over the past two months . <P> For the first time since the Red Brigades launched their murderous campaign , officials have also rounded up numerous sympathizers who form the terrorists ' underground support network . They include operatives who supplied the Brigades with information from redoubts as diverse as parliament , the office of a Cabinet minister , the army and even the police antiterrorist squad . <P> The prize catch is Antonio Savasta , 26 , leader of the unit that abducted Dozier and a participant in 17 terrorist murders . Short , stern-faced , and clean-shaven since his Jan. 28 arrest in the Padua apartment in which Dozier was held prisoner , Savasta has fingered dozens of fellow brigatisti . He has also signed an open letter to Red Brigades members still at large , urging them to abandon their armed struggle . The message was underscored by a similar plea from the Brigades ' reputed mastermind , Enrico Fenzi , 43 , a onetime professor of Italian literature at the University of Genoa who was arrested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long bloody years , the armed struggle has demonstrated its inability to construct any political program whatever . The Red Brigades chapter is tragically closed . " <P> Savasta confirmed reports that the Red Brigades had developed ties to other terrorist groups , including the Palestine Liberation Organization and West Germany 's Red Army Faction . He also provided a fascinating , if as yet inconclusive , link between the Red Brigades and the Soviet bloc . In prison depositions , he claimed that the Red Brigades had been in contact with the Bulgarian embassy in Rome . One of the supposed intermediaries was Luigi Scricciolo , 35 , an official of the Unione Italiana del Lavoro , one of Italy 's largest trade union federations , and an alleged Red Brigades undercover agent . After Dozier was kidnaped , the embassy reportedly was willing to offer assistance in exchange for any NATO secrets the kidnapers might pry out of Dozier . ( They were unsuccessful. )
