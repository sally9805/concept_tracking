He is the kind of man many Japanese admire  --  handsome and well tailored , an avid yachtsman and tennis player , successful politician and novelist . But what makes Shintaro Ishihara , 57 , one of the most popular figures in Japan these days is his unapologetic view of the country 's pre-eminence on the world stage . As a corollary , he warns the U.S. that its days as a leading economic and industrial power are numbered and that it ignores Japanese interests and sensibilities at its peril . <P> Ishihara , an outspoken intellectual , first rose to national prominence in 1955 , when he published a popular anti-Establishment novel , Season of the Sun . Elected to the Japanese Diet in 1968 , he has since served as Transport Minister and head of Japan 's environmental agency . Earlier this year , he voiced his strongly nationalistic views in a 160-page volume called The Japan That Can Say No . The book has gained considerable attention in his own country and caused some dismay in Washington , where it is now circulating in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morita , the book was aimed mainly at Japanese readers . In his chapters , Morita echoes much of what he has said elsewhere about America 's slothful business habits and loss of competitiveness . But it is Ishirara 's chapters that are the most contentious . He asserts that Japan now holds the technological balance of power in the world . The Americans may own the missiles , for example , but they can not fly straight without Japanese semiconductors . Japan , Ishihara argues , must use its technological leverage to assume its rightful place in the world . No longer must the country walk a respectful , and silent , three steps behind the U.S. <P> Although Ishihara does not champion the notion of Japanese racial superiority , he argues that race has been a crucial factor in shaping America 's " biased , incorrect views " of Japan . " The modern civilization built by whites is coming to a close , " he writes , " and I feel that this is adding to the irritation of Americans . " He adds that the U.S. is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is controlled by an Asian country . " <P> The book , like Ishihara , is decidedly blunt . That in itself is a novelty : most postwar Japanese thinkers , obsessed with war guilt and appreciative of America 's magnanimity during and after the Occupation , have largely preferred a cautious , indirect approach when writing about relations with the U.S. But the new assertiveness shown by Ishihara intrigues many Japanese citizens : in a recent poll , his name placed third among likely candidates for the prime ministership . Many political insiders feel he is too controversial to get the top job . But Ishihara himself insists that " Japan needs a leader who can say yes or no clearly , " as he told TIME 's Seiichi Kanise in the following interview . <P> Q. Your book The Japan That Can Say No , co-authored with Morita , is generating controversy in Washington . Are you surprised ?
