After he suffered a ruptured aneurysm of the brain in 1983 , Massachusetts Fireman Paul Brophy lapsed into what doctors judged to be a vegetative state . Before his illness , Brophy had told friends that he would never want to live in a coma . " If I 'm ever like that , just shoot me , " he said . " Pull the plug . " Accordingly , when Brophy failed to respond to therapy , his wife Patricia asked hospital officials to remove the feeding tube that kept him alive . They refused on ethical grounds , and she then filed suit , asserting that her husband had a right to die a natural death . The result : a landmark ruling last September from the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts ordering removal of the feeding tube . Eight days after it was taken away , Brophy died . <P> Who was right  --  Brophy 's wife or the hospital ? Should the sanctity of human life override suffering , indignity , even a patient 's own wishes ? Such agonizing dilemmas were at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 70 health administrators and scholars from 28 states and Canada . Their topic : the morality of removing feeding tubes . The meeting 's sponsor was the Catholic Health Association , whose membership includes 615 hospitals that admit 6 million patients a year and 267 nursing homes that care for 74,000 aged patients . <P> The controversy over feeding tubes , said J. Stuart Showalter , of CHA 's legal department , is becoming one of the most perplexing ethical issues of the 1980s and ' 90s . Declared he : " Emotions rise , rhetoric becomes strident , and even among the experts there is no consensus . " The problem is especially thorny for Roman Catholic institutions , because many right-to-lifers are demanding new laws against what they see as killing by " starvation . " Aiming occasional barbs at the strict pro-life stance , most of those who met in Boston insisted that Catholic tradition accepts an end to feeding in medically hopeless cases . <P> The dispute will heat up shortly , when the New Jersey Supreme Court rules on a suit filed by the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feeding tube from the 31-year-old comatose woman . A contentious brief in the Jobes case was filed by New Jersey 's Catholic bishops . In the view of several Boston participants , the document distorts church tradition by opposing the withdrawal of nutrition under any circumstances . <P> An estimated 10,000 comatose Americans who can not swallow are now kept alive by feeding tubes , usually inserted into the stomach directly or through the nose . The claim that such patients  --  or proxies acting on their behalf  --  have the right to halt nutrition was endorsed a year ago by both the American Medical Association and the American Bar Association . Seriously debilitated but conscious patients who are unable to swallow are claiming the same right . Last month a Colorado court granted a no-feeding request from a patient who was conscious but paralyzed from the neck down . He died two weeks ago .
