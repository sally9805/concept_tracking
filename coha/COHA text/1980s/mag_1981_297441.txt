The political harping , and press posturing , that Ronald Reagan is extravagant , self-indulgent and acquisitive is a bad rap . True , he Likes to run with California millionaires . He is one himself . But , personally , Reagan is quite a different type . <P> His richman image ballooned when he accepted four pairs of $1,000 cowboy boots with gold Presidential Seals . Then the White House announced the purchase ( with private donations ) of 4,372 pieces of china for $209,508 , or about $ 1,000 a place setting . For politicians , image is often everything . Just when a President is about to cut back on school lunches is not the time to buy teacups and start wearing cowboy boots made of calf and ostrich hide . <P> Yet fair is fair . Reagan may be worth $3 million or $4 million , but Lyndon Johnson , John Kennedy , Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon were millionaires too . Of the past seven Presidents , ranked by wealth and indulgence , Reagan would be next to the bottom , tied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the acquisitive scale would be L.B.J. by several lengths . Estimates of his fortune varied from $3.5 million to $20 million . He collected land , cattle , boots , cars , airstrips , telephones , helicopters and anything else around-with his money or the taxpayers ' . It sometimes did n't seem to matter . <P> Kennedy had tastes that were quiet , but proportionate to his estimated $10 million fortune and the $400 million family holdings that backed it up . He liked exclusive beach houses , boats and planes . Nixon had homes in San Clemente and Key Biscayne , improvements on which cost the taxpayers huge sums . Dwight Eisenhower had his magnificent Gettysburg farm fixed up and stocked by admirers . <P> Next to the Johnson abode on a 2,000-acre spread near Austin , Reagan 's house on his 688-acre California ranch looks like a log cabin ( " It is , " protests Nancy ) . No central heat . No wine cellar . Two bedrooms . Three cattle . Six horses . Three McCulloch chain saws ( for cutting firewood ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a John Deere executive saw Reagan 's tractor , he dispatched a salesman to make a deal . The President was told that for $58,000 and his old model , he could get the tractor of his dreams . " Forget it , " Reagan answered . ) <P> This President is not a dedicated collector . He owns one small Grandma Moses painting , one Charles Russell bronze statue of a boxer ( a gift ) and several contemporary western artworks . His modest gun collection came from gifts . He has no yacht-just a 12-ft. canoe , the Truluv . His stereo rig would be spurned by the average twelve-year-old . The Corum $20-gold-piece watch he sports is a ten-year-old gift from friends . A couple of years ago , he and Nancy made a pact for a mutual Christmas gift , a power log splitter . <P> Reagan looks spiffy in public appearances , but his tailor , Frank Mariani of Beverly Hills , insists that he sometimes wears his suits ( now $1,000 each ) for twelve years . Aide Mike Deaver claims that Reagan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he first came east . A friend spotted him wearing a new tie recently and asked about it . Reagan said that he knew the narrow widths would come back in style if he kept his old ties long enough .
