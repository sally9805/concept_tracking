Reagan puts the ball in the Soviet court-and Gromyko bangs it back <P> The first salvo from Washington prompted an unprecedented counterblow from Moscow , which in turn triggered a second strike from the U.S. Fortunately , this intercontinental escalation involved only words about nuclear missiles-in fact , competing proposals for getting rid of them . But the public relations battle , essentially for the mind of Western Europe , could not have been more serious . <P> Ronald Reagan made the first use of a high-tech propaganda weapon : international television . As cameras hummed in the East Room of the White House , projecting his image not only across the country but also by satellite to Europe , he announced on Wednesday morning that the U.S. is now prepared to negotiate an " interim solution " to the problem of medium-range nuclear-tipped missiles in Europe . If the Soviets would dismantle a significant number of their 351 modern , triple-warhead SS-20s , Washington would reduce the number of American missiles , capable of hitting the U.S.S.R. , that it is scheduled to station in Western Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pershing II and cruise missiles now planned , the U.S. would install only enough to match the Soviets warhead for remaining warhead . <P> Previously , U.S. negotiators at the intermediate-range nuclear forces ( INF ) talks in Geneva had stressed the zero option : if the Soviet Union scrapped all its medium-range missiles , the U.S. would deploy no missiles at all in Europe . But , said the President , in 16 months of negotiations it has become obvious that the Soviets will not agree to that plan . Thus the U.S. was willing to accept a less ambitious solution on the missiles . Said Reagan : " It would be better to have none than to have some . But if there must be some , it is better to have few than to have many . " <P> The President had no illusion that Moscow would embrace this idea or even bargain seriously about it for many months . His real purpose was to prevent a potentially disastrous split between the U.S. and its NATO allies . Under pressure from a noisy antinuclear movement that regards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms race ( conveniently overlooking the fact that the Soviets are installing new SS-20s at the rate of one a week ) , West European governments have been pleading with Washington to show more flexibility in the Geneva talks . Initial government and press reaction indicated that Reagan had told Western Europe what it most wanted to hear . Said a front-page headline in the influential Paris daily Le Monde : WASHINGTON SCORES A POINT . <P> The point obviously struck home in Moscow too , provoking the Kremlin into an all-out propaganda counterattack . Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko called a televised press conference to reply to Reagan . That in itself underscored the urgency felt by the Soviets : in 26 years in his job , Gromyko had given only a handful of news conferences in Moscow , and this was the first broadcast outside the U.S.S.R. The two-hour session was beamed live to the U.S. starting at 2 a.m . Saturday , Eastern time ( see box ) . Gromyko 's aim was obviously to keep European nuclear fears high by quashing any hope that Reagan 's initiative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
