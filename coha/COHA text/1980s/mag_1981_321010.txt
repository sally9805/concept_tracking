Inflation leaps , the dollar sags and U.S. oilmen scream <P> It was billed at the time as a bold stroke to free Canada 's $40 billion oil and gas industry from foreign domination . In fact , seldom has a single governmental action more thoroughly disrupted a country 's economy than has the National Energy Program put forth last October by the government of Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau . <P> Though the program 's various tax and subsidy provisions were intended to encourage giant foreign multinationals like Shell , Exxon and Mobil to sell at least some of their Canadian operations to local companies , the effect has been to aggravate a host of economic difficulties . Inflation has surged to an annual rate of 13% , the Canadian dollar has slumped to 800 in American currency , its lowest point in 50 years , and investment capital has been fleeing Canada . <P> In the past nine months alone , Canada 's battered economy has sustained capital outflows of more than $10 billion , compared with an average outflow of about $2 billion annually during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just because of current economic upset but because of a perceived sense of increasing intervention in the Canadian private sector by the Ottawa government . <P> The cheap Canadian dollar has proved a bonanza for U.S. tourists heading north for summer vacations . But for Canadians , the drop means further deterioration in their economy . Canada and the U.S. trade more with each other than with any other country , and the sagging currency threatens new rises in the cost of Canadian imports of clothes , food , electronic equipment and other goods from the U.S. <P> Renewed inflation is certain to bring escalating demands for wage increases by Canadian workers and more labor unrest . Just last week the nation 's postal system resumed operations after a six-week strike by 23,000 postal clerks . Mail delivery was brought to a halt , and the economy suffered an estimated $350 million in business-related losses . A key issue in the strike : a union demand for 17 weeks of maternity leave at 93% of full pay . <P> In an effort to keep the Canadian dollar from slumping further , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank lending rate to 21.24% , the highest such interest rate of any central bank in a major industrial country . Last week Finance Minister Allan MacEachen disclosed that the government is considering a new package of foreign borrowings beyond the $5.5 billion in standby credits now available . The funds would be used to help bolster the Canadian dollar on international markets . <P> Canada 's multiplying miseries are as much political as economic . Power sharing between the ten provinces and the central government in Ottawa has often been difficult , and separatist pressures in French-speaking Quebec have been especially troublesome . The most recent difficulty involves the burgeoning oil wealth of Alberta and other energy-rich western provinces , which have been waging a tug-of-war with Ottawa over energy pricing , taxes and revenues .
