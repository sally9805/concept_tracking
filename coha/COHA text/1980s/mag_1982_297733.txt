Arise , walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it . <P> - Genesis 13:17 <P> To go from Belfast to Israel is to be shot from a cold dark into an astonishing light , but one with a darkness inside it . <P> For the Israeli children the darkness is composed of apprehension and memory ; apprehension felt mainly in the north , where towns lie open to terrorists and Katyusha rockets ; memory felt everywhere in a land that is itself a child of war , where even the youngest know of places like Auschwitz and Dachau . For the Arab children in the occupied territories , darkness is in the present ; the land is no longer theirs , their freedoms are snatched away . Like the children of Belfast , both the Israeli and the Palestinian children resist the life imposed on them . The Palestinians show their strength of will in bitterness toward the enemy . The Israeli feelings are often more generous , perhaps because they are children of the victors . <P> Hadara , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of accommodation largely on her own-though not without professional help . Zion Ben-Eli , a young therapist in Nahariya , treated Hadara for several months after the incident . In the beginning she clammed up entirely , would not go to school , would not leave the house . She expressed herself in art . First she painted a hand , which she called the " hand of fate . " It is dark green , almost black , outlined in white with watery blue streaks running along the index finger . It looks more like a bay than a hand . To its right she put : " And in their death they commanded us to live . " Then she wrote a poem . Its opening and closing stanzas are the same : <P> <P> If there 's a God and yes , many claim there is , then how does it happen that little kids get killed ? <P> <P> The little kids of the poem were the only children of Danny and Semadar Haran , for whom Hadara , now 15 , used to babysit . Einat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed in April 1979 , when terrorists entered Nahariya from the sea in a motor-powered dinghy and attacked a four-story apartment house . In one apartment they found Einat and her father , whom they took back to the beach . Danny they shot to death , and when Israeli forces approached , one of the terrorists picked up Einat by the feet and cracked open her head on a rock . <P> Yael died differently . When the terrorists burst in on their apartment , Semadar and Yael were in a utility room , where they remained in hiding . Yael started to cry . In order to keep her daughter quiet , Semadar clamped her hand over her mouth , very hard . It is believed that she inadvertently suffocated the child . When the story was published , it drove the entire nation into profound mourning . There was Israel 's history in a single incident : the nation continually at war ; the nation as mother protecting her children ; the nation unwittingly suffocating her young for the wars in which it is caught . <P> Hadara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep silence . Yet she pulled herself out of it . She organized a peace conference in her high school between Arab and Jewish children . She called her conference " To Bring the Hearts Closer .
