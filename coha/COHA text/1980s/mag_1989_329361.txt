Dreamed up as an " epic " and " historic " way to celebrate 100 years of statehood , the Great Montana Centennial Cattle Drive turned out to be an epic logistical headache and a historic huckster 's delight ( kitschy western " art " and $3,000 gold-plated Winchester rifles for sale ) . To allow 2,400 people ( including a handful of real cowboys ) , 200 wagons and 2,800 cattle to plod 50 miles and six days from Roundup to Billings , U.S. Highway 87 had to be closed for two days . Saturday mail service to 15,000 Billings residents was canceled in anticipation of the drive 's arrival , which produced something unknown in days of yore  --  gridlock . One human death ( a 68-year-old spectator suffered a heart attack ) occurred during the drive , and half a dozen injuries were reported . Another casualty , noted by few , was the historic fact that the legendary killer winter of 1886-87 wiped out the open-range cattle business in Montana . Great long-distance cattle drives were fading memories before Montana became a state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
