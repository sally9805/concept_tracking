The IF Drug <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> Cancer may be nature 's most devastating army of destruction , but interferon March 31 may be the untapped defense that the princelings of medicine-health professionals and researchers-need to increase the odds for victory . <P> George J. Perchak Norwich , Conn . <P> How can one tell the terminally ill cancer victim he must wait for laboratory testers to decide just how much IF is safe ? He does n't have the time . Just ask any widow . Me , for instance . <P> Janet Gray Woodleaf , N.C. <P> <P> I was moved to tears by your article on interferon . As a registered nurse , I have worked with many patients suffering from " the world 's most terrifying and psychologically daunting disease . " My motivation as I campaign for cancer society funds has been intensified . <P> Marcia Buehner , R.N. Cleveland <P> There is an obvious reason why we do not have enough interferon today . The reason was ( and partially still is ) the National Institutes of Health Guidelines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U.S. prevented timely research on the cloning of human DNA for the purpose of making interferon efficiently and cheaply . These regulations still discourage and delay research on and production of future lifesaving medical products because of unfounded and silly fears of hypothetical and highly unlikely scenarios . It is high time to declare a moratorium on the N.I.H. guidelines . <P> Waclaw Szybalski , Professor of Oncology University of Wisconsin Medical School Madison , Wis . <P> As exciting as interferon research appears to be , it is , like most modern medicine , on the wrong track . Chemicals in the environment-food preservatives , air pollution , industrial solvents , chlorinated pesticides , radiation , tobacco smoke , etc. - are the causes of many cases of cancer . Why concentrate on the cure when the cause is the problem ? <P> John B. Calhoun Jr . Alpine , Texas <P> Can Anyone Win ? <P> In your article " But Can Reagan Be Elected ? " March 31 you say that " G.O.P. Front Runner Ronald Reagan relies upon a base of support that is on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bring yourselves to acknowledge the obvious : he has the broad center , and Kennedy , Carter , Anderson and the other liberals are on the far left of the people of this country . <P> Jack M. Marshall Lebanon , Ohio <P> If it is true that Reagan can not win in a Carter-Reagan race , then it is going to be a very funny election , because Carter can not conceivably win either . <P> Robert T. Dick Deerfield Beach , Fla . <P> Ronald Reagan vs . Jimmy Carter ? There 's only one word for that possibility : Help ! <P> Steve Joos Havana , III . <P> I strongly dispute your assertion that " the public has refused to forgive " Kennedy Chappaquiddick . Considering the repeated dark hints in the media , it would be more accurate to say , " The media have refused to allow the public to forgive him Chappaquiddick . " <P> David E.
