This was to be the best summer ever . Israel was throwing a lavish 40th- birthday party , and the Ministry of Tourism expected the crowds to break all records . Foreign visitors would flock to the festivals or the spectacular $12 million staging of Verdi 's Nabucco in the 5,000-seat Sultan 's Pool . They would sample the rich history of Jerusalem , the flashing , clear waters of Eilat , the archaeological drama of Masada . Bracing for a flood of guests , Hyatt International unveiled a $60 million , 500-room hotel in Jerusalem . Airlines scheduled extra flights , and car-rental agencies planned to plump up their fleets . Israeli tourist officials , anticipating 1.5 million visitors and record revenues of more than $2 billion , launched an ad campaign saying " You 've thought about it long enough . . . Come visit us in Israel . " <P> But what the officials could not have foreseen was the chilling effect of the civil unrest that has exploded in Israel since December . Rioting Palestinians in the occupied territories have been stoning Israeli soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the action flashing on television screens around the world . Although the violence has been largely limited to the West Bank and Gaza , many potential tourists see a country clouded by tear gas and moral ambiguities and are choosing to stay away . Tourism since April is 24% lower than in the same quarter last year . Hundreds of charter flights have been scrubbed and the Nabucco extravaganza canceled ; hotels stand half empty . If the trend continues , Israel could lose $300 million this year of the $1.5 billion it earns from tourism . <P> Roughly 25% of Israel 's tourists come from the U.S. , and they have been the first to change their plans . Tourism from the U.S. declined 28% in June alone . Most of the cancellations , not surprisingly , come from would-be first-time visitors rather than those who visit regularly and have family and friends in Israel . Many Europeans , meanwhile , seem undaunted by reports of the riots . The number of visitors from Japan , Germany , Scandinavia and Switzerland has actually increased this year , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame the media for their coverage of the conflict . Argues Minister of Tourism Avraham Sharir : " The bad publicity we are receiving is scaring people from coming here , especially from North America . " Sharir says he has lodged a complaint with the U.S. State Department about its travel advisory on the West Bank and Gaza , warning U.S. citizens " to avoid travel to these areas until further notice . " <P> Hardest hit by the cancellations is Jerusalem , where stores , hotels and restaurants are desperate for some well-heeled visitors . Along the Cardo , a rebuilt Roman boulevard in the Old City , ten of the 18 shops have closed ; others have had to slash prices to attract customers . " My sales are off 80% because I sell mainly to Americans , " says Eli Heller , manager of a leather- apparel store . Grumbles Ruth Elkayam , a cashier at Tayelet restaurant : " It does n't pay to open up in the morning . Our business is off by 90% , and instead of 40 workers we have 17 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several floors and dispatched the general manager to the U.S. to drum up business . And , notes Executive Assistant Manager Moshe Sand , " we no longer advertise that we are a stone 's throw away from the holy sites . "
