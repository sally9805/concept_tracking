txt NEW MILFORD , N.J. ? In 1968 , a few weeks before we were going to be married , my husband-to-be looked at me , and earnestly asked me to make three promises . " Promise . me we 'll never be bourgeois ; promise me we 'll never be ' dogged down by possessions ; promise me you 'll never grow up . " Just as earnestly , I answered him : " I promise . " I was - 22 , he was 25 . For four years , we lived in our attic apartment surrounded by books , listening to music by candlelight , the air laced with incense . We drank copious amounts of wine , got stoned , . ate Italian food . Our furniture was made up of castoffs ; our funds were limited . I wore my hair long and wild . My earrings hung down to my shoulders . On Sundays we went to museums . We were politically motivated and never missed a peace march . I worked hard for Eugene McCarthy and other peace . candidates . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in protest , refused to take his finals for his master 's degree in history . We talked of living in Europe , away from the America that killed its children . BUT IN THE END we stayed . We had our own children . Our first was born in 1372 , our second in 1974 . We needed more room . We needed a washing machine , a dryer . Instead of the Beatles and Beethoven , we listened to Sesame Street , records . ' Reading became impossible . There just was n't time . Money became important to us . There were doctor bills , and anyone with children knows what baby shoes cost . ? Our Sundays were spent at the playground . We gave up pot , afraid we would not be able to handle emergencies .. But through all the changes in our lives , we still clung to a certain vision of ourselves . We were different from our ; parents . Our children would be brought up in a different ' atmosphere : more open , with two parents who cared for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other , be stimulated by their conversation , grow up concerned with the well:biing of their fellow huthan Miriam Pickett is a housewife and a part-time secretary . beings . We moved from our attic to a five-room flat and then to our own house in a New Jersey suburb . We made new friends . We bought a dining-room set , redid our kitchen . We needed a lawn mower , then lawn furniture . My hair thinned after child-bearing and I hid to cut it short . Dungarees gave Way to designer jeans , and the number of gold chains worn by bah ' .

HOWEVER , WHILE we felt Settled. , there sieriied to be a constant feeling of uneasiness .
