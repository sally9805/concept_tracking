At first the funeral seemed to be at least a melancholic pause in the long and bloody struggle between Ulster 's Protestants and Roman Catholics . On the eve of St. Patrick 's Day last week , an estimated 5,000 people had gathered at Belfast 's Catholic Milltown Cemetery to bury three members of the outlawed Irish Republican Army , the organization dedicated to uniting British-ruled Northern Ireland with the Irish Republic . The I.R.A . trio had been gunned down March 6 by a unit of Britain 's Special Air Service regiment in Gibraltar , where , the British government said , the three had planned a terrorist bombing . <P> As the coffins were being lowered into the earth , the crack of gunshots and the thud of hand grenades echoed over the grave markers . Panicked mourners dived to the ground or crouched behind tombstones . Pistol in one hand , a bearded man hurled several more grenades into the throng and fired at the bereaved . As the injured staggered away in shock or cowered in terror , a group of enraged mourners pursued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beat him severely before he was rescued and arrested by men of the Royal Ulster Constabulary ( R.U.C. ) , the Northern Ireland police ! force . After his arrest , according to police sources , the terrorist asked , " How many of the bastards did I kill ? " The answer : three people dead . Some 60 others were injured , four seriously . <P> Even in Ulster , with its long history of anger and bloodshed , an attack on a funeral had seemed unthinkable . The incident raised worries not only in Belfast but also in London about a fresh cycle of sectarian violence : before the cemetery attack 14 civilians and members of the security forces had been killed in Ulster this year . In an effort to head off terrorist reprisals , Tom King , Britain 's Secretary of State for Northern Ireland , pleaded with both sides to avoid " revenge and retaliation " ; otherwise , he said , " the mad cycle of violence will go on and on . " <P> His appeal went unheeded . Two days after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no known connections to the security forces , was shot dead near the Irish border on Friday . Her 24-year-old boyfriend was wounded in the same attack . The IRA has claimed responsibility for the shootings . An even uglier incident soon followed . On Saturday , during the funeral procession for one of the Milltown cemetery victims , an angry crowd of mourners spotted two British undercover agents desperately trying to maneuver their car out of trouble . They were pulled from their vehicle , disarmed , stripped , beaten savagely , dragged into a nearby alley and killed , apparently with their own weapons . <P> Ulster Catholics tend to blame rising tensions in the province on what they consider provocations by the British government . Earlier this year , for instance , Britain announced it would not prosecute several R.U.C . men accused of obstructing an investigation into an alleged 1982 " shoot to kill " policy by the force against the I.R.A . The flames were further fanned when the three unarmed I.R.A . guerrillas were killed in Gibraltar .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
