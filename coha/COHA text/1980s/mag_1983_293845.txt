TIME rarely devotes an entire issue to a single subject ; in the past 13 years , only five topics have been so treated : blacks in America ( 1970 ) , the American woman ( 1972 ) , President Nixon 's resignation ( 1974 ) , the South ( 1976 ) and the Soviet Union ( 1980 ) . Early this year , the magazine 's editors decided that Japan , with its constantly increasing impact on international affairs , would be an appropriate topic for such an issue . Japan has moved into the forefront of the news as its booming economy has affected everything from the shopping habits to the trade deficits of the entire Western world . Japan 's politics , arts , technology , mores , business practices-indeed , its way of life-have become the subject of intense curiosity . <P> Yet this curiosity has proved strangely difficult to satisfy . <P> While Japan is by no means a closed society like the Soviet Union , which strictly limits access by foreign journalists to its citizens , it is , in the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different fashion , psychologically and linguistically .

Added to the magazine 's regular departments were five new sections : History , Culture , Psychology , Language and Travel , the latter written especially for TIME by William Least Heat Moon , author of the bestselling U.S. travelogue Blue Highways . A New York City printing firm provided the characters symbolizing each of TIME 'S sections ( the kanji above : Japan ) . <P> Reporter-Researcher Val Castronovo coordinated the efforts of the large research staff . Reporter-Researcher Rosemary Byrnes gathered and assessed material for the cover story . The editors were also substantively aided by two special consultants : Robert Christopher , former TIME senior editor and author of The Japanese Mind ( 1983 ) , and Edwin Reischauer , U.S. Ambassador to Japan from 1961 to 1966 and a noted Asia scholar who wrote The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
