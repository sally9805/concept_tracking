Just eight years after federal legislation outlawed mandatory retirement before age 70 , Americans in record numbers are retiring early , sometimes by 55 or 60 . The median retirement age of private-sector workers is now 62 , according to recent figures from the General Accounting Office , and over half of all new recipients of social-security retirement benefits are under 65. // But is the increasingly popular choice to take early retirement the right choice ? For some early retirees , the decision is hardly a free choice , growing out of overwhelming corporate inducements to quit . Sweetened pensions and other financial incentives can leave older workers - even those as young as 50 or 55 - with little choice but to accept. // // ' ' Some employees are afraid that if they don ' t opt for the company ' s offer of early retirement and take a lump-sum payment , that sometime later - six months , a year - there may be a reduction in force , at which time they would lose out , ' ' says Cyril Brickfield , executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , D.C. Although he believes that ' ' most companies do not act in bad faith , ' ' he worries about the effect on employees , particularly those whose skills have not kept pace with technological innovation and changing industrial demand. // ' ' Where do these workers go ? ' ' he asks . ' ' All too many of them simply have to work . Their pensions in too many cases aren ' t enough . It ' s hard to get a job at 55 , 65 , so what do you do ? ' ' // Even those not directly affected by a ' ' golden handshake ' ' can find the last years of their careers quietly altered by corporate attitudes . ' ' Just as age 65 has been a benchmark , so too age 54 is making its appearance on the horizon , ' ' says Mr. Brickfield . ' ' It seems when a person reaches that age , management makes a decision that this person isn ' t going to fit into future plans . They don ' t retrain them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These employees just serve out their time. ' ' // Although some demographers and employers claim that declining birthrates will increase the demand for older workers in the years ahead , a report due out next month offers a different point of view . The Task Force on Employment and Aging , sponsored by the Brookdale Foundation of New York City and the Community Council of Greater New York , predicts that ' ' the current environment of work scarcity ' ' could continue into the next century . As a result ' ' the burden of unemployment will continue to be most heavily allocated to the poor , elderly , and disabled . Even with an improving economy , ' ' the report states , ' ' it is not at all certain that mature persons in the next 10 to 20 years will enjoy abundant opportunities for employment. ' ' // Whichever projection proves correct , the trend toward early retirement would have profound effects on the social fabric of American life . Increased longevity coupled with shorter careers will mean several decades of leisure for many retirees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spouse ' s job and a couple ' s spending patterns can come up for reexamination . ' ' Retirement is a family affair , ' ' says George L. Maddox , chairman of the Council on Aging and Human Development at Duke University. // Social scientists and gerontologists , cautioning against unrealistic expectations , emphasize the need for careful planning. // Of prime importance , they note , are economic considerations . ' ' Over time you can ' t help moving into less purchasing power , ' ' says Harold L. Sheppard , director of the International Exchange Center on Gerontology at the University of South Florida in Tampa . ' ' The earlier you retire , the greater chance your income sources won ' t keep up with income needs. ' ' // Although there are 500 , 000 private pension plans in the United States , according to Mr. Brickfield , ' ' 90 percent of them pay very little in the way of monthly benefits . ' ' About half of all workers have no pension at all. // Then there are the social questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole subject of retirement has been so oversold , ' ' says Gerald J. Buchert , director of the Office on Aging in St. Petersburg , Fla . ' ' Unless people go into second careers , or unless they ' ve planned what they ' re going to do , it ' s boring . I ' m not a workaholic , but I think people need something productive to do. ' ' // Dr. Maddox echoes that theme . ' ' We ' ve got to rethink how we ' re going to use a lot of years . Anybody who comes to age 55 thinking ' I ' m getting out ' had better ask the question , ' What am I going to do with the next 25 or 35 years of my life ? ' // ' ' We can delude ourselves into saying ' early retirement ' without realizing how long we ' re talking about , ' ' he continues . ' ' Some thought ought to be given to the implications of this . Not just personal thought - our society needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . You find people busily , desperately looking for something to do that ' s significant. ' ' // Above all , he believes , people must cultivate inner resources . ' ' It ' s dangerous to go into late life without keeping intellectually involved , because it means being out of touch with options and information , ' ' he says . ' ' A changing environment requires competence and new skills . Keeping people intellectually involved changes everything. ' ' // Beyond individual considerations , there are larger societal issues. // ' ' If people are put out at 50 , 54 , whatever , what happens to social security , the trust funds , the contributions that are supposed to be pouring in ? ' ' Mr. Brickfield asks . ' ' Normally these people would be paying into funds , paying taxes , and not drawing . They no longer are contributors. ' ' // Dr. Maddox sees other potentially negative ramifications. // ' ' This country has sold itself , I think , a bad bill of goods , ' ' he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work force who have chosen to get out . Our public policy is encouraging people to think of aging as associated with decrepitude . The contrary evidence is startling . What we ' re seeing is more and more people living vigorously , certainly through their 60s , well into their 70s . But public policy is out of kilter with reality. // ' ' All our national and company policies continue to be pro early retirement . You get very few benefits in social security by waiting to begin drawing it . If we compare the incentives we offer in this country with those in any western European country , we have a different balance . There are stiffer penalties in other countries for taking the equivalent of social security early , and there are more benefits for waiting. ' ' // Still , for many retired persons , this new status offers opportunities unavailable during their earlier careers. // ' ' I have seen people who seemed to be sorry they made the move , ' ' Dr. Maddox says . ' ' But others seemed to be deliriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do for themselves , and some were happy to be personal entrepreneurs and consultants . Some people can ' t imagine living without work , but they can imagine a different kind of work , or a different balance of work and play. ' ' // To achieve this new balance , gerontologists maintain , requires a more creative approach to late-life employment. // ' ' Sweden has had an excellent program for tapered retirement - what they call a partial pension scheme , ' ' Dr. Sheppard says . ' ' Staying in the work force doesn ' t mean being stuck with the same job for 50 years . To what extent do people need to be retrained for part-time skills ? And how much are unions willing to accept part-time work ? // ' ' For a lot of people who hate their work , retirement is a way of getting away from a dissatisfying job , ' ' he concludes . ' ' But if people are satisfied with their job , get pleasure out of it , and are healthy , my philosophy is , Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of retirement to the rest of a worker ' s life this way : ' ' All generations should have an opportunity to work . The test should be not age , but the ability to perform satisfactorily. ' ' // // //
