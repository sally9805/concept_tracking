" Now that you ' re in America , " she recalled her teacher telling her , " we ' re changing your name to Grace . " That was 22 years ago and Miss Viera has held onto the Americanization of her name . But these days Miss Viera is a teacher herself , and she says she would never ask a foreign-born student to change his name or in any other way forgo his cultural identity . If anything , Miss Viera , a teacher at Public School 89 in Elmhurst , Queens , says she attempts - as many others today do in public schools around the city - to reinforce that heritage. // There has been a change in philosophy over the past decade in the city ' s public schools - long the homogenizers of the young , where learning the Pledge of Allegiance , reciting the preamble to the Constitution and cutting turkeys out of cardboard for Thanksgiving have been a way to inculcate American values to generations. // Many of these activities , of course , still continue , but in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s and 70 ' s that challenged the country ' s traditional values and stereotypes and pressed for equal rights for minorities and women , there has been a shift in thinking about how aggressive teachers should be in pressuring youngsters - particularly newcomers to this country - to conform to the American experience. // " We ' re not a melting pot anymore , " said Cleonice LoSecco , the principal of P.S. 89 , which is in the city ' s most ethnically diverse neighborhood , and , with 1 , 600 youngsters from at least 50 different countries , is among the city ' s most ethnically diverse schools . " Now we ' re a salad bowl . Every ingredient ' s distinct. " // In addition to the turbulence of the last two decades , educators say , the change by the schools to accepting cultural diversity also re-sults , in part , from the ease with which immigrants can return to their native countries , either for vacation or to live. // In this way , many immigrants - unlike the bulk of their predecessors - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved not only with family but also with the politics of their homelands . Another reason cited is that classrooms today are frequently conducted by teachers who themselves immigrated and are perhaps more sensitive to the issue than those who were born here. // Still , it is unclear what impact this change in the schools may have on the youngsters themselves . Will they adhere to a different system of values and standards from their classmates whose parents are Americans ? Immigrant parents are often torn by this issue as well , confused about how to strike a balance between a desire to maintain a link to their homeland and to be accepted here. // And debate continues within the schools about the validity of the change and what it has meant to the assimilation process : Should American society - and therefore its schools - place a premium on diversity or sameness ? // " Before , it was a stigma to come from another country or not speak English , " said Miss Viera , who teaches a bilingual class for Hispanic youngsters . " Our minds have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food , language , music . If you know more than one language , it is a sign of being more educated. " // Ann Pryor , who also teaches at P.S. 89 and is a third-generation American , would disagree . " I think we ' re postponing the inevitable , " Miss Pryor said . " Are they going to become part of this society or not ? " <> <> A Change in Tone at Schools // Of course , the schools still teach a basic curriculum of mathematics , English , social studies and science . The difference today is that many students for whom English is a new language are placed in separate classrooms to learn these subjects in their own tongue - part of the controversial program known as bilingual education . But beyond that , there has been a shift in tone. // At P.S. 89 , evidence of the new emphasis on cultural diversity is visible almost everywhere - from the celebrations of Simon Bolivar Day and the Chinese New Year to the spinach knishes and Jamaican patties served in the cafeteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featuring recollections by youngsters of their homelands. // No longer are students taught that there is only one way to eat or dress or speak , or that in order to be accepted one must forfeit his cultural past . Instead , teachers at the school have been directed by Mrs. LoSecco - as they have by principals at schools throughout the city - to emphasize respect for variation and cultural differences. // Aida Infante , who teaches the fifth grade , for example , was conducting a lesson the other day on the geography of the United States. // " How many pieces of the United States does America have ? " asked Miss Infante , who immigrated to this country from Italy . <> <> Symbols on American Flag // " Fifty , " a boy in the front row shouted . Miss Infante walked over to the window and grabbed the classroom ' s American flag . " How is this represented on the American flag ? " she asked . " Stars , " said Aman Bhasino , 10 years old , who moved to this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbols , " said Miss Infante . " Class : Say the word symbols . " " Symbols , " shouted the class , which is composed of 27 youngsters from 11 different countries . " If we go south , what country would we find ? " " Mayheeco , " said Mario Sandoval , who moved to this country three years ago from Colombia . " Mayheeco , " Miss Infante repeated in the same accent . " You see , class , he says it right . We say Mexico in this country . But in Mexico they would say Mayheeco . " <> <> Possible Confusion for Children // While the rationale for this deference to other cultures has long been to emphasize every individual ' s worth , even its advocates agree that despite its advantages , it nevertheless can be confusing to youngsters - particularly in light of the conflicting signals they often receive at home. // " They ' re neither fish nor fowl , " said Mrs. LoSecco , who is an immigrant to this country from Italy and a strong advocate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divisions within a family . Identity is so difficult to establish . Many are running a tightrope. " // Just the other day , for example , Joseph Piro was teaching his fifth-grade class of 37 youngsters a section on current events . The conversation turned to citizenship. // " How many of you consider yourself American ? " Mr. Piro asked his class , most of whom were born in other countries . Only about 10 youngsters raised their hands . When Mr. Piro asked how many would ever want to return to their native country , almost none did. // " My mother always tells me I ' m a Chinese girl , " said Wendy Chan , 10 . " And I tell her , no I ' m an American . " <> <> Problems for the Parents // " I ' d say I was Korean because I was born there , " said Michael Kwak , who moved to this country five years ago . " But I think it ' s better over here . There ' s sports , video games , movies. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about life in this country that sometimes torment parents about their own priorities . Some parents , of course , have not begun to think about the question of their youngsters ' identities and are more preoccupied with financial survival and their children ' s academic progress in school than their national allegiance . Sill , many seek to maintain the traditional mores of their homeland and are anxious that their children not lose sight of their origins. // " I ' d like him to feel both Hispanic and American , " said Gloria Barrancos , whose son Alvaro , 10 , attends P.S. 89 and who came to this country five years ago from Bolivia . " I want him to know where his grandparents came from and to always be able to speak Spanish , too. " // Wang Yuet Lin , who moved to this country from Hong Kong three years ago and whose 6-year-old son , Yeun Hang , attends the first grade at P.S. 89 , says , however , that she has never thought about the question of allegiance. // " He doesn ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mrs. Lin . " He just knows that he ' s in America and America is good . " Shortly after she enrolled her son in school , Mrs. Lin decided to give him the American name of " Benny . " She said she did it in the hope that he would feel that he belonged here. //
