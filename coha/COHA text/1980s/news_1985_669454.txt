There were dozens of people on the scene , from preschoolers to retirees . No one was idle . In the attic , a teen-age girl from Chicago was installing insulation . Outside , three other girls mixed cement , cracking jokes as they worked . A retired insurance agent framed a window in one bedroom , to the music of hammers from the crew putting up siding . Cars bearing cold drinks and sandwiches came and went. // // One of the volunteer workers , Roy Jernigan , had been coming to this town annually for 13 years . Each summer he traveled across the state for a ' ' vacation ' ' which he spent working without pay to help someone he didn ' t know build a house . ' ' To me , this is living , ' ' he said . ' ' People helping people - it ' s one of the basic concepts of America. ' ' // For five full days , the action continued unabated . Then Saturday dawned , and the house Carylon Cooper had dreamed of for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single mother with two small children , owes her dream house to a program that has helped nearly 200 low-income families in this rural area build homes of their own. // Macon County , in the mountains of western North Carolina , is a ruggedly beautiful place with about 20 , 000 residents . The Appalachian spirit of ' ' neighbor helping neighbor ' ' is strong here ; it helps to account for the success of the Self-Help Housing Program , started in 1967 by the local community services agency , Macon Program for Progress ( MPP ) . // Families meeting the income guidelines can apply for a long-term , low-interest loan from the Farmers Home Administration ( FmHA ) , then build a house on their own site . An MPP technical assistance staff offers guidance and instruction , but generally not labor . That comes , in various ways , from volunteers . Often , families cooperate to build each other ' s houses . Then there ' s a steady flow of workers from the community - people who want to help or who enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the act , too ; many of these volunteers are recruited through church networks , and a number of them return on their own in subsequent years. // Most of the houses have been built by the homeowners themselves in three-family teams . They work together to frame one house , then go on to the others . They rotate their work until all three buildings are complete . The market value of a finished house averages $42 , 000 . The program keeps the cost to about $27 , 000 , and a big chunk of the savings is the owners ' ' ' sweat equity. ' ' // Katie and Joe Harden , who moved into their new house not long ago , had known their share of frustration . They had applied for a loan to buy a cousin ' s house . ' ' The day the loan came through , the house burned , ' ' Mrs. Harden says . Self-Help gave them a workable option. // ' ' When you first start you think , oh , goodness , we ' ll never get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three families work , it goes faster . Building it yourself , it means more , ' ' she adds . She and her husband have put so much extra effort into their house that it has become a showplace for the program. // The concept of three families building three houses has remained the core of the program , but early on it became clear this approach would not always work . Some applications came from families that could not contribute labor because of disability , or because there was no man in the family to do the heavy work . The volunteer house was born . Eighteen such houses have now been built . Three more are going up this year. // Carylon Cooper almost gave up hope on her volunteer-built house . ' ' We ' ve moved several times , ' ' she says . ' ' The children have never really had their own place . ' ' She and April , 7 , and Derik , 5 , had been sharing a room in her parents ' trailer. // ' ' I ' d been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( FmHA ) loan , and signed three options , but they didn ' t work out . ' ' Getting a home seemed impossible . Then Mrs. Cooper got a call from Pat Garrett , director of MPP . ' ' She asked if I was still interested . I said yes , and started again from the beginning , ' ' she explains. // Self-Help works , but not because it ' s easy . Applicants experience all the frustrations known to any would-be homeowner dealing with loan applications , plans , and millions of details. // ' ' It was really , really hard work , ' ' Mrs. Cooper admits . Alone in the house after a day at work , she often experienced ' ' tears , frustrations , depression , ' ' facing innumerable tasks that remained after the army of volunteers had gone . ' ' I told myself , this is nobody ' s responsibility but mine . ' ' Friends and relatives pitched in , but still she put uncountable hours into finishing the kitchen cabinets and other woodwork , cutting brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to me to live in this house that I have worked so hard on . I wouldn ' t appreciate it as I do if I hadn ' t put this kind of time in it , ' ' she says . ' ' I ' ve never sweated so hard in my life - it ' s hard , manual labor . But you are working toward something. ' ' // The work that participants invest seems to pay off . Some 85 percent of the families still own their homes , and the retention rate for these loans is higher than for the regular FmHA program. // For Mrs. Cooper , building a Self-Help house paid unexpected dividends . She senses a new strength in herself , and she willingly took on the task of explaining the program to a skeptical audience at a statewide poverty conference. // ' ' It ' s good to do it yourself , ' ' she says . ' ' And it ' s good to have people help you . It restores your faith in mankind . As soon as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping others get what ' s been done for me. ' ' // The MPP ' s Mrs. Garrett credits the program ' s success to a multitude of factors , including a ' ' very conservative board of directors that views the houses as . . . increasing the tax base of the county , and believes in encouraging people to put in work to get something . ' ' Although the low interest rate is a form of subsidy , as is the technical assistance offered by MPP staff , this is no giveaway program. // ' ' The people of the county are down on welfare , ' ' Mrs. Garrett says . The mountain ethic values work , independence , and neighborliness , qualities at the heart of Self-Help. // The concept of work was important to the program ' s founder , Harold Warstler , who saw it as more than a way to lower the cost of housing for the poor. // ' ' Sometimes we give people 10 cents ' worth of help and they lose 20 cents ' worth of independence , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed , but we shouldn ' t diminish their feeling of having gotten somewhere on their own.
