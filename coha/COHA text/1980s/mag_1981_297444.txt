Where the graft comes sweepin ' down the plain <P> Humorist Will Rogers , Oklahoma 's favorite son , once joshed a former U.S. Treasury Secretary : " Mac , knowing you was manager of Uncle Sam 's Treasury so long , I thought you 'd be well heeled . " Rogers ' homespun irreverence about official greed may be timeless , but Oklahomans today are not laughing . A three-year federal investigation of the state 's elected officials has found that graft is routine and nearly ubiquitous in Oklahoma county government , and has added as much as $10 million a year to the state 's road-maintenance costs . Only one county commissioner and one businessman have finished their trials so far ( both were convicted ) and another pleaded nolo contendere . But prosecutors say they have evidence against more than 250 people - 104 of whom have agreed to plead guilty - and that nearly all of the state 's 77 counties are represented . Fifty-one of the 231 current county commissioners have resigned , and perhaps 100 more face charges . The probe has spread to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seventh was convicted . Says Assistant U.S. Attorney William Price : " It certainly is the largest investigation of public corruption in terms of sheer numbers in the nation 's history . " <P> The frauds involved county purchases of construction equipment and materials by the commissioners . Some payoffs were straightforward " commissions " of 10% . Others were bills , either outrageously padded or for nonexistent equipment . One 28-year-old rock-crushing machine worth $5,000 , for instance , was bought for $42,500 , and a $14,000 used road grader was leased for one year for $27,500 . <P> The FBI and the IRS cracked the case by first amassing evidence against bribe-paying contractors . Two of the contractors-Lumber Mill Owner Dorothy Griffin and Building Materials Salesman Guy Moore-were persuaded to help investigators catch fellow suppliers and the recipients of their largesse . Scores of transactions-conducted in pickup trucks and county maintenance barns-were tape-recorded . Moore claims that in 28 years of business , he arranged , on the average , more than one bribe every working day . <P> Cecil Parker , a former commissioner who will plead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on nonchalance . " This thing 's been happening since they made county commissioners , " says Parker , who at 76 is two years older than the state of Oklahoma . " Sure I took kickbacks . I never asked a man for it . They always gave it to me . " Says Betty Eisenhour , who as clerk of Canadian County was an unwitting intermediary for the graft : " I always wondered why I was paying middlemen . Now I know . The commissioners were good old boys , but just between you and me , they were thieves . "
