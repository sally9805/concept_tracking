It was like a scene out of Woody Allen 's Bananas . A ragged band of soldiers played The Yellow Rose of Texas in 110 degrees heat as two helicopters , their blades whipping up dust in the clearing , touched down at the base camp in Honduras , three miles from the Nicaraguan border . Out of one jumped Texas Governor Mark White , in combat boots and freshly pressed camouflage fatigues . Out of the other , a platoon of reporters , who quickly surrounded him . The Governor also brought 400 lbs . of Texas barbecued beef , 7,200 flour tortillas , 100 lbs . of pinto beans , and buckets of barbecue sauce and jalapeno peppers . <P> The $1,400 Texas meal , paid for by the Governor 's political fund , was a home- cooked treat for the 419 volunteer Texas National Guardsmen participating in the Big Pine III war games . Invited by the Department of Defense , which frequently asks National Guard units to assist in maneuvers , the reservists flew down to play the bad guys in the second stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 armored personnel carriers , they staged a mock assault on a Honduran hilltop position , sweeping toward the encampment in a 4 1/2-mile-wide front while Honduran warplanes darted overhead . <P> Many of the reservists were well prepared for the two weeks of maneuvers . Most were of Hispanic origin , almost two-thirds speak Spanish , and many were Viet Nam veterans . Hondurans from Las Hormigas , a village near the Texans ' temporary base ( dubbed " the Alamo " ) , responded with surprise and delight when they heard the foreign soldiers speaking Spanish . " I was asked if we were in the Mexican army , " Sergeant Raul Ortiz , 35 , a Viet Nam veteran , laughingly told TIME Correspondent David S. Jackson . The men who had seen action in the war were excited by the prospect of a sham battle . " These boys are pretty charged up , " said Staff Sergeant Ray Sloane , 38 , another Viet Nam veteran . White , who as Governor is commander in chief of the Texas National Guard , went down at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 've got our troops down here , " he said . " We want to see how they 're doing . " Texas ' participation , while generally popular in the gung-ho state , was criticized by some as politically motivated . White , a centrist Democrat not known for grandstanding , denied that he was boosting U.S. policy in the region . " I 'm not trying to send any signals , " he said , " except to support the men . " <P> During his two-day stay , White behaved much as politicians will in media- intensive situations : he shook hands with the men , posed for pictures , gave speeches and signed autographs . He gave a cattle brand in the shape of Texas to Colonel Roy Kimerling , commander of the joint task force participating in the games . Surrounded by ten Army guards , White even inspected a municipal project , a new well dug by his Guardsmen.
