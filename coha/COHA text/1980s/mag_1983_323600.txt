New weight charts are lenient - too much so , say some doctors <P> Dieters ate their desserts with a little less guilt last week . Thanks to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. , women who are 5 ft. 2 in. and tip the scales at 140 could consider their weights to be right on target , as could 180-lb. men who measure 5 ft. 10 in . For the first time since 1959 , the giant insurance company revised its widely used height-weight guidelines , moving them upward by as much as ten to 15 lbs . in the case of short men and women . The news brought sighs of relief from gourmands but cries of alarm from some doctors , who fear that overweight Americans will worry less about trimming down . <P> The charts are based on data from 4.2 million people who were tracked by 25 insurance companies for more than two decades . Statisticians correlated weight to longevity , taking into account body frame size . ( This is determined by bending an arm at a right angle and measuring the distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbow ; a 5-ft. 10-in. man with a 2-to 3-in. span is considered to have a medium frame . ) The results of the study , says Dr. Paul Entmacher , chief medical director for the company , show " weights at which people live the longest . Only in that sense are they ideal or desirable . " <P> Yet a number of medical authorities feel that the new figures are in no way desirable . The American Heart Association last week issued a statement urging people to stick with the more rigorous 1959 guidelines . " The more you weigh , the more heart attack , heart failure and even stroke in some groups , " said Dr. William Castelli , medical director of the well-known major study of heart disease under way in Framingham , Mass . " The fact that fatter people are living longer may merely reflect the growing success of medical intervention in weight-related ailments , " said Dr. Virgil Brown , chairman of the A.H.A . nutrition committee . <P> Several doctors point out that the weight charts are skewed by one key factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than average and die at an earlier age . Including them in the study thus tended to push the optimal weights higher . When the Framingham group examined the longevity of thin men who do not smoke , says Castelli , it found " the lowest overall death rate and the best health experiences " of any population . <P> For its part , Metropolitan does not believe that people who adopt the new guidelines will die younger . And some doctors see a bright side to the standards . " Fighting Mother Nature is getting to be a serious problem , " says Dr. George Blackburn , a renowned nutrition expert at Harvard . " I have a hospital full of anorectics . " He advises people who are only a few pounds away from their goals to " relax , adjust to the new range and start having fun . There 's no reason to be a size 6 or 8 when a size 10 , or even 12 if you 're big boned , is healthy . " This advice does not go , however , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women or 44 short for men . Nearly 50% of the U.S. population weigh more than the figures in the new table , says Metropolitan 's Entmacher . " We 're still telling them to lose weight . "
