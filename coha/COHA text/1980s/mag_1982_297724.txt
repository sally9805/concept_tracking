When the White House speechwriters crafted Ronald Rea gan 's Christmas message , they tried desperately to get away from Charles Dickens ' hoary label for any era : " It was the best of times ; it was the worst of times . " But they failed , drawn again to that time-worn language to describe the maddening contradictions of the world today . And indeed , Dickens ' words may be especially apt for 1982 , a year with no poetry in its sound , no numerical magic . It is a year that a number of scholars and statesmen are already predicting will be momentous for the industrial democracies of the West , a time combining peril and <P> opportunity . The perils are obvious . The free world 's alliances are weakened and some of its economies faltering ; the adversaries are more threatening and the have-nots more demanding . Military power and its illicit offspring , terrorism , threaten to break all restraints . Firm decisions elude American strategists on nuclear security . Recession continues and worries deepen over the impact of budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and building industries spills over to small business , farming and credit <P> institutions . The accumulated stress spells fear . Zbigniew Brzezinski , National Security Adviser to Jimmy Carter , pulled his trench coat around him in Washington the other morning and said , " The foreign policy crisis that I predicted for late winter is starting to develop by early winter . " He cited four areas-Poland , the Middle East , Central America and China-that have reached critical mass against a dispiriting background of European neutralism , Third World alienation , frustrations about nuclear arms <P> and indecision within the President 's council about what we should do . Brzezinski 's counterpart from the Nixon-Ford years , Henry Kissinger , sees the next months as one of the most critical junctures in postwar American history , ranking with the 1956 Suez and Hungarian crises and the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 . " It is almost exactly a generation since the great creative acts of the immediate postwar years were put in place , " says Kissinger , referring to such landmarks as the Marshall Plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests today , in Kissinger 's view , are for the nation to deepen values and transcend materialism at home , and to meld firmness and <P> conciliation abroad in wise portions . Failing that , he says , " we can become irrelevant in just a few months ' time . " Public television 's Scholar-Author Ben Wattenberg , a senior fellow at the American Enterprise <P> Institute , declares : " Poland is one of those great events that happen once in a generation to unmask the truth . " Like former CIA Director and Ambassador to Iran Richard Helms , Wattenberg sees much of the world struggle transformed into a propaganda war of unprecedented scope , in which perceptions of strength and weakness-conveyed in words and spirit-are critical elements . Both Helms and Wattenberg would have the President muster academics , peace marchers , public relations experts , labor groups , corporations and churches in a worldwide educational effort to show that the Communist system is a brutal failure .                   @ @
