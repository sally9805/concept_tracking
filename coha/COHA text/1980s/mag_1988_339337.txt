What will my boss think ? Sure , it would be swell to stay home with the wife and baby . But will I fall off the corporate ladder ? <P> Those are questions many men ask when considering a paternity leave . Marc Greenhouse did not hesitate to take a month 's leave three months ago , when his first child , daughter Ranit , was born . A 40-year-old data-processing systems analyst for Transamerica , Greenhouse began his time off a few days before his wife Dianne gave birth by caesarean section . He savored the days with his infant . Says he : " It was really a blessing . " <P> Once he returned to work , Greenhouse continued to follow the 7 a.m. - to- 3:15 p.m. schedule that he had chosen under Transamerica 's flextime policy . He says his professional standing has not been affected by the leave . But his choice is not yet a common one : few of the fathers eligible for Transamerica 's paternity leave actually take it .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
