Newswatch/Thomas Griffith <P> Lincoln 's Gettysburg Address , brief as it was , would not be brief enough now for television . Oh , the cameras would be there , but they would focus first on the man from ABC-CBS-NBC describing the scene and recalling the battle . In the background Lincoln would be seen speaking but would not be heard saying , " The world will little note , nor long remember , what we say here . " TV 's formula these days is words 100 words from the reporter , and a " sound bite " of 15 or 20 words from the speaker . At long last Lincoln 's turn comes ; he is heard pledging that " government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth . " This is Horace Everyman , ABC-CBS-NBC News in Gettysburg . <P> In these days of short attention spans and mandatory commercial breaks , a similar This of the political process is now taking place every Sunday . This is the talk pace of the questioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be soporifically but sedately informative . The new style is faster and sharper . " Those with a little to say come through better , " laments Marvin Kalb of NBC 's Meet the Press . " Those with a lot to say have a harder time . " <P> The revving up began on ABC 's highly successful This Week with David Brinkley , where Sam Donaldson is teamed with Columnist George F. Will , whom Brinkley describes as " an Encyclopaedia Britannica on wheels . " Side by side , they take turns at boring in on a guest . Only a politician with aplomb and a fast tongue can escape being overwhelmed by this pair , even though , as the old saying goes , a fool can ask ten questions while a wise man answers one . Sometimes an affable Brinkley eases up their questioning : " We 've become aware of very bad public reaction if we seem rude and aggressive . " <P> Meet the Press decided to meet the competition . The program used to be like a tidy congressional hearing ; now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderator , while his predecessor , Producer Bill Monroe , took Kalb 's old job as lead questioner . A fourth camera was added , permitting cutaway shots between questioner and guests ; in the speeding up , everyone became interruptible . <P> More articulate more guest lists are narrowed to what Kalb calls " an articulate elite " reflection both sides of issues , which , he argues , " is not really an honest reflection of reality . " Brinkley agrees : " If you 're windy and verbose you just do n't get on the air . " <P> Just who belongs to this articulate elite ? One favorite is Senator Bob Dole of Kansas , knowledgeable , funny and fast on his feet . Of the Cabinet , Brinkley singles out Treasury Secretary Donald Regan . Among foreign leaders , Brinkley and Kalb prize West Germany 's ex-Chancellor Helmut Schmidt . " He 's the TV era 's ideal West German Chancellor , " says Kalb , since Schmidt speaks English well and can be " irritable and irritating . " Kalb also finds Menachem Begin fascinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical question : Would the Middle East have been different , at least in American eyes , had Yasser Arafat been as personally appealing and articulate as Anwar Sadat ?
