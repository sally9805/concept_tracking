The Entertainment Channel , a joint venture of the RCA Corporation and Rockefeller Center Inc. , the Rockefeller family real estate concern , was begun last June as a quality television service , with Broadway shows , new dramatic and comedy series and a large number of imports from the British Broadcasting Corporation . Last Tuesday , after nine months , 50 , 000 subscribers and $34 million in pretax losses , the channel announced that it will end its service on March 31. // How could The Entertainment Channel , conceived by a former president of CBS Inc. , backed by the corporate parent of NBC and staffed with a host of professionals recruited from rival cable services , fail so badly , so soon ? Mr. Taylor , who was hired , then fired , by William S. Paley at CBS in the 1970 ' s , laid the blame squarely on the recession . He observed that fewer cable systems were being built or expanded - thus foreclosing the construction of more " seats in the theater " - and fewer individuals were prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The Problem Was Access ' // Had the economy cooperated , Mr. Taylor maintained , The Entertainment Channel would have met its break-even point - a relatively modest 1. 4 million subscribers - in 1984 . " The economic model was sound , " he said . " The problem was that we could not get access to enough markets. " // But members and close observers of the cable industry suggested that The Entertainment Channel was an idea whose time might never have come . " It ' s a fundamental programming question , " said Paul Kagan , an analyst who publishes an industry newsletter . " Were they showing programming because there was demand for it , or because it was the kind of programming that they thought should be shown ? " // The Entertainment Channel ' s mistake , Mr. Kagan and others said , was to try to impose its own lofty programming standards on a marketplace happy with " Dallas " and " Dynasty . " Industry members singled out Mr. Taylor for much of the blame , noting that his experience lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a show business phrase , Arthur Taylor was blinded by the glint of the Guccis , " said a former CBS colleague . " What happens to people dazzled by show business is that they think anyone can be a programmer . What a programmer needs is the ability to stand completely apart from his own tastes and understand what the audience ' s tastes are . " <> <> Confusing Mix of Programs // Cable industry members and observers agreed that the quality alone did not doom The Entertainment Channel . Rather , they say , it was the mix of programs - British situation comedies , Broadway plays , failed network series and foreign movies - that confused both cable operators and viewers . " It said what it wouldn ' t be , that it wasn ' t a movie channel , but didn ' t give a clear idea of what it would be , " said Richard Cox , president of the now-defunct CBS Cable , a performing-arts service. // The confusion was compounded by the name , suggesting glitzy Las Vegas-style shows rather than Broadway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of broad-based entertainment , but the service was narrower , " said Gerald Levin , vice president of Time Inc. ' s video group , which includes Home Box Office and American Television and Communications , a leading cable operator. // In many cases , Mr. Taylor conceded , viewers who subscribed to The Entertainment Channel frequently canceled after one month because they never watched it . Many who did watch did not like what they saw. // " We found that the particular fare offered was not as popular as had been expected , " said Rupert Walters , executive vice president , marketing , at Warner-Amex Cable , which offered The Entertainment Channel to subscribers in St. Louis , Houston , Dallas , Pittsburgh and Cincinnati . <> <> Few Subscribers // Although The Entertainment Channel had begun to make some inroads among cable operators in recent months , its total subscriber count remained low . By last week , it was being offered by 84 systems with a total of 2. 5 million subscribers . But only 50 , 000 of those households subscribed to The Entertainment Channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Kagan , the number had recently dropped to the " low 30 , 000 ' s . " Even the higher figure was well below early estimates that , Mr. Taylor said , " in a normal market , we could get 20 percent to 30 percent penetration of the basic subscribers. " // Nonetheless , he asserted , the number of subscribers was not a major problem . What did prove insurmountable , he said , was the decision by cable operators , responding to the recession and high interest rates , to postpone building systems in other cities or increasing the number of their channels . As a result , The Entertainment Channel had to fight for a position in established markets . <> <> No Luck in New York // In New York , an obvious market for quality programming , The Entertainment Channel never even got a place on the dial . " We were prepared to virtually give it away " in New York , Mr. Taylor said , but both Group W and Manhattan Cable told him that they lacked the capacity. // Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not become alarmed until early December , when he attended a cable operators ' convention in Anaheim , Calif . Operators there indicated that the building of new systems , already behind schedule , would be delayed further by the recession . As a result , the Rockefeller Center-RCA board that oversees The Entertainment Channel began to draw up contingency plans for replacing the service with a cable channel exclusively supported by advertising and offered free to viewers . " We didn ' t think we ' d have to go to it , " Mr. Taylor said . " Then the data kept being reinforced . " Last Tuesday , the board voted to pull the plug. // According to Mr. Taylor , the decision came at a time when The Entertainment Channel was getting a grip on marketing , with direct approaches to viewers and a 16-page handbook on how to use the channel . It had signed up 72 more cable systems , which brought millions of potential subscribers . Such factors might have argued for staying the course , Mr. Taylor said , " but the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Try Again // In place of The Entertainment Channel , Mr. Taylor plans a broaderbased service - lighter-weight BBC shows and " a lot more movies . Our new service will look a lot like a broadcast entity without a broadcast license , " he said. // RCA and Rockefeller Center , however , appear to be approaching the new venture more cautiously . While both organizations have expressed support for the new channel , " we ' re waiting to see the plan he ' s working on , " said Jim Reed , a spokesman for Rockefeller Center . Other members of the cable industry noted that advertiser support had not sustained CBS Cable. // But Mr. Taylor expressed confidence that advertising would provide him enough time to build up a successful channel . " There ' s still an enormous number of dissatisfied television viewers , and that ' s what we ' re going for , " he said . " Our problem was that we couldn ' t find them fast enough.
