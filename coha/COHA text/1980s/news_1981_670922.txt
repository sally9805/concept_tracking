The clues involve precisely timed seismic records , including one cut short last May 18 when the blast destroyed an observing site six miles northeast of the mountain. // Photographs taken from various angles and at different times during the eruption , some of them by visitors who had illegally penetrated the danger area ( and survived ) have been assembled . Using such pictures an avalanche specialist has mathematically run avalanches " backwards " up the mountain to determine their time of origin. // From these clues scientists have deduced that the triggering event on May 18 was a fairly severe earthquake ( magnitude 5 ) that dislodged a gigantic bulge , formed in recent weeks on the mountain ' s north side . In the largest landslides ever recorded by American geologists , this bulge slipped down the mountain like a vast sliding door. // With this " door " open , rock that had become supercharged with highly compressed gas exploded , ejecting to the north a tremendous horizontal blast . The reconstruction has removed uncertainty over whether the earthquake caused the eruption or vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected in its casualty list : more than 100 square miles of forest buried or blown down , 61 people killed or missing , and an estimated 7 , 000 elk , 12 , 000 deer , 300 bears and 5 , 000 coyotes. // Intensive observations are being made in search of symptoms that might warn of a repetition . Predictions of lesser eruptions are routinely being made with increasing success . In recent days the mountain has continued to shoot gas and steam into the air . It seems likely that activity will continue for a score of years , but probably without another lethal explosion. // It has been discovered that across the Pacific in Kamchatka , St. Helens has a twin , Mount Bezymianny , whose eruption in 1955 and subsequent development were strikingly similar to the recent history of St. Helens. // According to Soviet accounts one side blew out in a devastating explosion , followed by mudslides that swept down valleys radiating from the mountain . It is suspected that , as with St. Helens , the explosion was triggered by a great landslide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the blast a dome developed within the crater in successive stages , as has occurred here since last May . The dome within Bezymianny is now <> considerably larger than that presently inside St. Helens . Destructive eruptions of Bezymianny have occurred intermittently since 1955 , the most recent a few years ago. // Dr. Stephen D. Malone , seismologist at the University of Washington , believes this means that St. Helens may continue to erupt for another 20 years or more . Dr. Malone and Dr. Barry Voight , an avalanche specialist at the University of California at Santa Barbara , have pieced together the timetable of events last May. // All efforts to find some sort of premonitory hint of the May 18 explosion have failed , possibly because of the special manner in which it was initiated by an earthquake . A smaller explosion had been expected because of recurrent earthquakes in previous weeks , but no indication of when it might take place had been identified . From evidence of past eruptions it had been assumed the blast would be upward and hence relatively harmless. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the many that had occurred in recent weeks , though unusually intense . Its only novel feature , according to Dr. Malone , was the eight-minute series of tremors that followed the quake , caused by subsequent landslides and avalanches . <> <> Measuring Tremors and Swellings // According to Dr. Donald W. Peterson , scientist-in-charge for studies of the mountain by the United States Geological Survey , seismic tremors have proved the most useful indicators of impending eruptions . However , precise ranging on sites near the dome inside the crater is also making it possible to monitor the dome ' s growth before eruptions. // The chief site from which such measurements are made is Harry ' s Ridge , named for Harry Truman , keeper of the lodge that stood on the shore of Spirit Lake , then a scenic gem at the foot of the mountain . The blast filled the lake with debris and buried Mr. Truman and his lodge. // The lake is again filled with water but its surface is higher than the original lake . It is carpeted with logs , stripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slopes. // Whenever weather permits , Dr. Donald A. Swanson of the Geological Survey is landed on Harry ' s Ridge to take measurements from there to nine sites in and near the crater . Pulses of laser light are aimed at reflectors on each of the volcano sites . The travel time until their return is recorded electronically , indicating the distance to within a fraction of an inch. // On a recent day he made measurements while Dr. Peterson recorded the readings , including air temperature and pressure required for corrections . Because hydrofluoric acid in fumes within the crater erodes the reflectors , they can not be left there . Each time measurements are made a helicopter lands someone who holds a reflector over a bench mark on the crater floor . <> <> Into the Caldron // On this occasion there was so much steam swirling within the crater that Dr. Swanson asked the helicopter pilot to help him aim his laser by hovering over the man . Suddenly from within the caldron of steam a flickering pinpoint of red light became visible to those on Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dome swells it pushes the crater floor outward , as the measurements show . During five days spanning an eruption on Dec. 25 , the north side of the crater moved north 47 inches. // At three places on the volcano , devices have been installed to measure changes in tilt of its slopes , but such recordings in the most active area , on or near the dome , have not been practical because the tiltmeter , costing about $2 , 000 , would soon be overrun by creeping lava. // According to Dr. Daniel Dzurisin , who has been studying ground deformation for the Geological Survey , expendable tiltmeters , costing about $100 , have been developed by the California Institute of Technology . It is planned to place two of them closer to the scene of action and radio their readings back to the project headquarters in Vancouver . <> <> Dangers of High Viscosity // Special caution is needed , for as the May 18 blast showed , during its active periods Mount St. Helens , like other volcanoes ringing the Pacific , can be explosive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lava is then so stiff it clogs the volcano vents and allows enormous gas pressure to develop inside . Repeated analyses of the extruded lava at Mount St. Helens have provided no more than hints that its silica content is diminishing , making further explosions unlikely. // It is slow-flowing lava that accounts for the steep-sloped profiles of such volcanoes . They arise where slabs of sea floor are being overridden by an advancing continental plate. // One warning of an explosion might be a tapering off of gas emissions when the volcano ' s " safety valves " have become clogged . The problem , as explained by Dr. Thomas Casadevall , who has been conducting gas measurements , is that such a tapering off could have the opposite meaning . It could occur because the molten rock , or magma , that has risen from within the earth has discharged most of its gas . The emissions have tapered off steadily since last July. // The measurements are made on clear days by flying through the volcanic plume - admittedly a method subject to large errors - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record pollutants from tall smokestacks . <> <> No Place Was Safe // On the day before the explosion David Johnston of the Geological Survey made such measurements from the Timberline Parking Lot at the foot of the mountain . Emissions of sulfur dioxide had dropped from an estimated 40 tons a day to only 15 tons . The next day he observed from a " safer " distance -a lofty spot near Harry ' s Ridge . He was presumably swept away by the blast and his body has never been found. // Two probes on the crater floor record escaping hydrogen which , scientists believe , is released by the molten rock as it solidifies . They also suspect that a burst of hydrogen would occur if the carapace of solid rock capping the molten material were ruptured as prelude to an eruption. // Before the explosion a number of stations were established around the volcano for magnetic , seismic , tilt and gravity measurements . The latter , it was assumed , would indicate elevation changes or largescale movements of subterranean material . Only small changes were recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used as a comparison site , was buried by the eruption. // Efforts to observe St. Helens in sufficient detail to diagnose its day-to-day developments have been severely handicapped by weather and by its explosive nature , requiring special caution . By contrast , Kilauea , the active Hawaiian volcano , is of the nonexplosive , midocean type in a fair-weather environment . Researchers can drive to it at any time of day or night to emplace or read instruments densely scattered around it. // Except for a few stations transmitting data by radio , the St. Helens measurements can only be made in daylight when the weather is clear . As a consequence there have been gaps of many days over the past year . Nevertheless no American volcano of the explosive type has ever been so intensively studied. //
