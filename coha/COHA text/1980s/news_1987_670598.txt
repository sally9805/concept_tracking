The study is designed to determine whether the drug AZT , or azidothymidine , which has been proved beneficial in patients suffering from late stages of the disease , can also help the far larger number of people who are infected with the AIDS virus but have not developed symptoms of illness. // Because the drug can have severe side effects , doctors are reluctant to condone its wider use until a study shows that the benefits outweigh the dangers . <> <> Judged a Priority // The trial , which some experts consider a possible key to curbing the toll of the epidemic , was judged a high priority by Government officials in September 1986 . But as of Dec. 18 , the study had enrolled only 755 of the 1 , 562 patients needed at 19 medical centers around the nation . Organizers expect to complete enrollment by next summer and to have the results three years later. // Part of the delay has been caused by efforts to insure that the study was designed properly and ethically , so scientists would not discover years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmed. // But much of the delay has also been caused by less inevitable problems : a false start at the Federal level , initial problems in obtaining the drug from the manufacturer , administrative foulups and a seeming " business as usual " approach at some medical centers that actually treat the subjects. // There is also , ironically , a reluctance on the part of many AIDS virus carriers to enter the trial , either because they fear that in a controlled trial they may get a placebo and not the drug , or else they fear the toxicity of AZT . Some medical centers in the two cities with the highest concentrations of acquired immune deficiency syndrome cases , New York and San Francisco , have enrolled only a handful of patients in the trial. // In the opinion of many experts , the lagging AZT study is potentially the most important AIDS drug trial now under way . <> <> Most Become Ill // Left untreated , an estimated 20 to 30 percent of all infected individuals will progress to full-fledged AIDS within five years , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long run , they say , most and perhaps nearly all of the infected individuals will become ill. // But if AZT , which hampers the ability of the AIDS virus to reproduce , should prove capable of protecting infected people from illness , it might help stop the epidemic . Many of the estimated 1 million to 1. 5 million Americans who are now infected with the AIDS virus would gain a reprieve from likely doom . Their ability to transmit the disease to others might diminish as well. // " If AZT works in infected asymptomatic individuals , it is theoretically possible to convert the AIDS epidemic into a nonepidemic , " said Dr. Samuel Broder , the top AIDS drug expert at the National Cancer Institute , who played a crucial role in developing AZT . He added , however , that no drug would eliminate the need for a vigorous public health education campaign to slow the spread of the AIDS virus. // Dr. Roy Widdus , coordinator of AIDS activities at the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. agreed , saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is beneficial for asymptomatic infected individuals . " <> <> Precious Time Squandered // Doctors and patients are also eager for results from the trial because a growing number of healthier patients have begun taking AZT against official recommendations , and it is important to find out whether the benefits are worth the known medical risks . AZT can suppress bone marrow , causing severe anemia and other problems. // By ordinary medical standards , officials say , the study is progressing reasonably well , enrolling patients far more rapidly than the typical clinical trial of an anti-cancer drug . But viewed against the backdrop of AIDS having been declared the nation ' s top health priority by Federal officials , months have been wasted by such administrative problems as the lack of a secretary at one medical center and the lack of a nurse at another. // The idea that AZT should be tested in healthy infected individuals came up almost immediately after the first major trial of AZT found in September 1986 that the drug was effective in prolonging the lives of people suffering from full-fledged AIDS or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next Step // Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and the Burroughs Wellcome Company , the drug ' s manufacturer , agreed that a logical next step would be a study to see if AZT could also prevent healthy but infected people from progressing to disease . Burroughs Wellcome had the drug , and the centers had the likely subjects for the study , a group of gay men in San Francisco whose progress had been followed for years . Scientists at the disease centers prepared a protocol , or design , for the study within a few weeks , and optimists among them hoped that the study might start enrolling patients by March 1987 , or even earlier. // However , the disease centers , which are renowned for their epidemiological studies , had no particular expertise in conducting clinical trials and no money to support the costly project . Both the money and the reputation for clinical excellence lay with another agency , the National Institutes of Health , which had been given money by Congress to establish a network of testing sites . So in February 1987 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which planned to expand it to include many more subjects and many different testing centers. // A new protocol had to be drafted , under the leadership of Dr. Paul Volberding , a top AIDS physician at the San Francisco General Hospital and the University of California ' s medical school in San Francisco . Dr. Volberding started writing the draft in late February , circulated it to other experts and government officials for comment , and finally completed the job on May 19 , which he considered " incredibly fast for a protocol of this importance . " <> <> Drug Finally Made Available // The next major hurdle was obtaining a supply of AZT for the trial . Burroughs Wellcome at first resisted all entreaties , explaining that an outside advisory group had recommended that supplies of AZT , which were then scarce because of limited manufacturing capacity , should go first to patients who were already sick . Finally , in March , the company agreed to make the drug available , but it left the actual packaging of the drug and the identical-looking placebo up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // But the study faced additional obstacles at the participating medical centers . Some medical centers enrolled patients rapidly . By Dec. 18 , the date on which the latest figures were available , the University of Minnesota had enrolled 95 patients , the University of Rochester 94 , and the University of Miami 85. // But in New York and San Francisco enrollment has been slow . At Dr. Volberding ' s own institution , the University of California in San Francisco , his carefully drawn protocol got hung up for two to three months at the university ' s institutional review board , which must approve the consent form for patients and other ethical and scientific features of the study . <> <> New York Enrollment Cited // More delays ensued while Dr. Volberding sought approval from N.I.H. to hire more staff members , and made arrangements with clinics to enroll patients in the study. // One of the poorest enrollment records has occurred at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York , which had only six patients on Dec. 18 , and has since added a seventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An important factor , officials there say , was a desperately short supply of nurses , leading to a two-month delay while Sloan-Kettering hired two nurses to handle the enrollments. // Another New York institution , the Mount Sinai medical center , had enrolled only eight patients by Dec. 18 . Officials there attribute the delays partly to a shortage of qualified candidates who want to participate in the study - subjects must meet stringent criteria to be called " asymptomatic , " and can not have experimented with other anti-AIDS drugs - and partly to administrative problems. // " We ' re having some growing pains at the moment , " said Dr. Henry Sacks , director of the clinical trials unit . " We need more space and more personnel . The number of doctors , nurses and laboratory personnel who want to work on AIDS is not as great as the number needed. " // Part of the problem in New York and San Francisco , according to doctors and organizations that represent many AIDS victims , is that this particular trial of AZT in asymptomatic individuals is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Those eligible for the trial still feelhealthy and often see no urgency to seek treatment . Even if they do want treatment , they often prefer to find a less toxic drug than AZT on the underground market . And if they want AZT , the only drug with proven efficacy in any AIDS patients , they often prefer to get it from a sympathetic doctor who will prescribe it , instead of gambling on a clinical trial where they may be randomly assigned to a group that receives only a placebo. // Now that the trial is under way and most of the " administrative glitches " have been surmounted , Dr. Volberding said , the study should progress to full enrollment by summer . But it will still take an estimated three years after that for the study to provide meaningful data . Infected individuals typically progress toward AIDS very slowly , and it may take three years to determine if AZT has any effect in slowing down the normal slow progression toward disease. //              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
