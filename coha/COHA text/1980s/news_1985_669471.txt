It didn ' t show houses , or heavy equipment , or a city skyline . Instead , a woman was shown holding five loaves of freshly-baked bread. // The message was subtle but unmistakable : If they ' re baking bread up in Yamburg , then they ' ve really tamed the Arctic . For in the Soviet Union , as perhaps nowhere else , bread has become a symbol of well-being. // // For centuries , Russians have customarily welcomed visitors with bread and salt - the symbols of fertility and contentment . But since the Russian Revolution , the state has gradually taken over breadmaking , to the point where only a scant minority of Soviet citizens even bother baking their own anymore. // Soviet bread is cheap , widely available , and often exceptionally tasty. // The Soviet state is today arguably the world ' s largest baker , producing bread in a variety and quantity unmatched in any other country. // Exact production figures are a state secret , but a few statistics do give some idea of the importance of bread to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been about 120 kilograms ( 264 pounds ) yearly , among the world ' s highest . Muscovites alone eat 2 , 400 tons of bread daily. // The state directly runs 2 , 500 bakeries , and 16 , 000 smaller ones are operated by cooperatives , mainly in rural areas. // So important is bread to this country ' s communist leadership that myriad propaganda posters extol its virtues - and , of course , the role of the state in supplying it. // Some gargantuan state bakeries are capable of producing 300 tons of bread daily . The state employs 300 , 000 people in baking industries. // Through subsidies and price controls , as well as mechanization , the state has kept the price of bread unchanged since 1955 . But that has led to waste. // Last year , the ruling Politburo passed a resolution calling for ' ' greater strictness in adhering to established procedures for the use of bread and other food products. ' ' // That was a reference to the widespread practice of feeding bread to pigs and other livestock - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Party organizations in many areas condone wasteful attitudes toward bread , fail to create an atmosphere of intolerance toward such views , and have been lax in educating the public. ' ' // ' ' This , ' ' concluded the Politburo , ' ' causes great moral and material harm. . . . ' ' // According to officialdom , every mouthful of bread should carry a political message. // ' ' If our people are supplied with not only the cheapest bread , but also the tastiest , we should be grateful for those who fought in the revolution and the war against fascism , ' ' says Anatoly Grishin , chief engineer of the directorate for bread-baking , macaroni , and yeast industries of the Soviet Ministry for Food Industries. // ' ' The abundance of bread , and its accessibility , is one of the greatest achievements of the Soviet people . It ' s a guarantee of our well-being. ' ' // The official Soviet news agency Tass routinely reviews grain and bread production in the Soviet Union and is unfailingly upbeat about what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with food grain has been fully resolved , ' ' one Soviet official told Tass. // In another dispatch , Tass stated flatly that ' ' the grain the Soviet Union imports goes to feed cattle. ' ' // Well , not exactly. . . . // What Soviet consumers aren ' t told is that much of the bread they ' re eating is baked with imported wheat , millions of tons of which come directly from the United States. // During the one-year period between July 1984 and June 1985 , the Soviet Union imported 55 million tons of grain - 22 million of it from the US . US wheat made up 6 million to 7 million tons of that total. // It is unclear just what happens to the wheat once it ' s shipped here : Different government ministries give different explanations as to its uses . But it is known that 70 percent of the nation ' s bread is made from wheat. // Says one Western expert , ' ' We suspect that most of the imported wheat is used for milling purposes - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet wheat to be diverted for use as cattle feed. // Still , what is perhaps more important than where the raw materials come from is what they are turned into. // This country produces more than 800 kinds of bread and bread products . They range from common domashanya ( household ) rolls to stolichniye , the ' ' capital ' ' bread of Moscow , to unabashedly elitist ' ' fancy ' ' bread that can cost as much as 33 cents a loaf - expensive by Soviet standards. // Run-of-the-mill bread costs from 15 cents to 25 cents and can be bought by the half or quarter loaf . And , in fact , many shoppers do buy small quantities at a time , since Russian bread contains no preservatives and molds fairly quickly. // One of the more popular kinds of bread is orlovsky , a blend of rye and wheat flour . But if Russia could ever be reduced to a taste , it surely would be the pungent , slightly sour one of black-brown borodinsky bread , with a sprinkling of anise seeds on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crust. // And there are other temptations , like baranki - small , dry , round buns with a hole in the middle , or sukharyei , poppy-seed rusks. // A visit to just about any Russian bread store often poses a dilemma - which kind of loaf to choose. // A recent visit to one of Moscow ' s biggest bread shops - named simply khleb ( bread ) - found 18 varieties on sale . At most shops , there are usually spoons on hand to press down on the tops of loaves to check for freshness. // And it seems that every bread store has a resident babushka ( grandmother ) , who can divine the best varieties by punching , smelling , and watching the new loaves tumbling down into wooden bins. // Most of these babushkas are only too happy to share their accumulated wisdom. // ' ' It ' s good . Buy it , ' ' counseled one kerchiefed woman to a foreigner who had , in her view , passed over just the right loaf. // And rare is the child who leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , round bublik with a hole in the center seems made for child-sized hands and appetites - if , that is , the child can be steered away from the honey-coated cakes or packages of cookies that tempt from the higher shelves. // Bakeries in Finland and Yugoslavia have licensing agreements to produce Russian bread , using the Soviet government ' s secret recipe . But Mr. Grishin says the Soviets are also interested in reaching a licensing agreement with a US company. // American bread is , ' ' to our opinion , unusual , ' ' he says . ' ' It ' s - how would one say it - fluffy . There ' s a lot of air in it. ' ' // ' ' It looks good , ' ' he avers , ' ' but as to taste and flavor , it can ' t compare with Russian bread.
