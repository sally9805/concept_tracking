John Kennedy would get a good chuckle out of today 's reverence for the 1960 Boston-Austin political partnership meticulously reconstructed by Michael Dukakis with Lloyd Bentsen . Kennedy had planned a Boston-St . Louis axis , which does n't even rhyme . He intended to run with Missouri 's Stuart Symington . <P> J.F.K. had pondered the Vice President question very little as the Los Angeles convention approached . His consuming concern was to win a first-ballot nomination . He flew to New York City 's Idlewild Airport on Friday night . He and Jackie had a suite in the nearby International Hotel . It was a strange evening . There were only a few reporters around and virtually no Kennedy aides or security people . <P> Near midnight the Kennedys headed upstairs . Kennedy , coatless , sat on a stiff couch with his feet up on a coffee table . He looked boyish , lonely , far from being a world leader . Yet there was a sense of events rushing in on him . <P> We talked convention mood and figures . As always , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that I had been down with Johnson at his ranch a few weeks earlier and that I had been talking with the Texan right up to the day before . Kennedy and I agreed that L.B.J. 's late lunge at the presidential nomination would fail . But the vice-presidential nomination ? <P> " There is no question in my mind , " said Kennedy . " Lyndon would be the best man I could get to run with me . He 's a Texan , a Southerner , he knows Congress , Washington , and he has the ability to be President . But I 'm convinced he would n't take it . He 'd be more powerful staying as majority leader . What do you think ? " <P> I concurred and even added a few more doubts . I had gone over the question every which way with L.B.J. , until he got irritated and stormed that he would not do the Kennedy family 's bidding . He declared that the vice presidency was a worthless job compared with being Senate leader , related the sad tenure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office nothing more than a " pitcher of warm spit , " and said Speaker Sam Rayburn had told him to stay far away from it . If he could not be President , he would stay in the Senate , Johnson had told me with such rage and finality  --  his nose an inch from mine  --  that I chalked him off . <P> Kennedy listened , grinned , nodded . We both were awed and amused by the tumultuous Johnson . " Have you decided on a vice-presidential nominee ? " I asked . " Yes , " answered Kennedy . " Can you tell me ? " I asked . " I will if you promise not to publish it , " J.F.K. replied . " Senator , do n't do that to me , " I implored . " We 've got two days before the magazine is printed , and I 'm sure the name will leak . I do n't want to be bound . So do n't tell me . " Kennedy gave a wry smile , said , " O.K. , I wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be Stu ( ( Symington ) ) , " I said . Kennedy shrugged , a soft confirmation of sorts . ( It was not hardened until the following week , when Kennedy asked Clark Clifford , a Symington friend , to tell the Senator he was the choice . ) <P> Kennedy had one final thought on that night 28 years ago . " We 'll have to offer the job to Lyndon , that 's for sure . He 's a proud man , and he 'd be mad if we did n't . He 's too big a figure in the party and in the country . He 'll enjoy turning it down ; then we can make our choice . " But he had n't even thought about a Texas ambush.
