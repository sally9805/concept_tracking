In a sense , you could say he doesn ' t do anything - but that ' s not fair . As head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) , Louis O. Giuffrida has the enormous task of preparing for what he hopes he ' ll never have to do : deal with the consequences of disasters , from chlorine leaks and hurricanes to terrorist attacks and nuclear war. // Created in 1979 , FEMA is an umbrella organization carved out of the merger of federal civil defense and flood management programs , the Small Business Assistance Administration , and other agencies . It ' s a bureaucratic network that could make a federalist blanch. // But Giuffrida doesn ' t bat an eye in justifying the hefty organization at a time when other agencies are being eliminated . That ' s because his vision for FEMA is in the true federalist spirit : a lean organization , a guiding but not strangling hand to states or communities , a coordinator of human and financial resources - but not a substitute for well-trained local response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity of command , ' ' he says in a pensive , general-like way , ' ' so that we don ' t have various segments of government jumping off in opposite directions. ' ' // Giuffrida actually is a brigadier general in the California National Guard , and he attained the rank of colonel in the regular Army . He has the reassuring visage of the calm helmsman - the kind of guy you ' d want to be in charge if the ground began to shake and buckle around you , or the nuclear spitballs begin to fly. // Still wondering what FEMA does ? Perhaps the young agency is best described in terms of what it doesn ' t do. // If , for example , someone left a ticking briefcase on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange , the authorities ' first response would be to keep the device from exploding . ' ' That ' s not FEMA ' s job . That would be the New York City Police Department , the FBI , and everybody else . . . . FEMA has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiate for hostages , or to track terrorists , or to round up a SWAT team , ' ' General Giuffrida says. // But if the suitcase contained a ton of high explosives that could flatten out most of Wall Street , ' ' it would be our job to make sure that we had standing by the ambulances , doctors , food - and translators , because that ' s a polylingual area , ' ' he explains. // In a hijacking , a bomb threat , or other terrorist acts , FEMA would presumably be the one agency that would know what was going on - who to call , what services were needed , how to coordinate state and local police and emergency teams with other specialized squads . In part , FEMA is a sort of clean-up crew which ' ' manages the consequences ' ' of emergencies. // The umbrella agency ' s most visible activities have been associated with weather-related disasters such as hurricanes and floods , and geological phenomena such as earthquakes and the Mt . St. Helens eruptions . No small task - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local agencies which get involved when large numbers of people , crops , or businesses are threatened by disasters. // FEMA does the groundwork to help the president decide when to declare a federal disaster area . The chief executive ' s decision is based largely on FEMA ' s recommendations . President Carter was criticized for his ' ' liberal ' ' usage of the Federal Disaster Relief Act in declaring Miami a disaster area during the influx of Cuban refugees in 1980. // President Reagan has declared 15 federal disasters this year - mostly harsh storms , tornados , and floods . But the event that got the most attention was his decision to deny federal disaster relief to the state of California in its battle with the Mediterranean fruit fly . A FEMA spokesman says it was felt that the state had the resources to meet the crisis on its own. // General Giuffrida is more than familiar with California ' s crisis management resources . As the creator of California Specialized Training Institute ( CSTI ) in 1971 , he developed programs that were the microcosm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our national history , we ' d had a whole series of massive civil disorders , ' ' he says . ' ' One of the things that came out of that unhappy national experience was a realization that a community that faces a massive civil emergency . . . doesn ' t normally have in its own closet all of the assets that it needs to restore as quickly as possible the normal process of government. ' ' // So at CSTI he created a mythical city and county named Santa Louisa ( after his then 11-year-old daughter ) in which disaster scenarios were enacted and resolved . The institute ' s ' ' students ' ' came from agencies that don ' t normally work together but which would be required to do so under high stress circumstances - law enforcement groups , fire services , schools and colleges , the Red Cross , and private sector organizations. // General Giuffrida says his aim was to develop a ' ' common vocabulary ' ' - to have dialogue , not a jumble of soliloquies at a time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went about this was to examine all the emergencies the US had experienced over the past 50 years . Eleven years and 28 , 000 graduates later CSTI training courses cover floods , earthquakes , terrorism , hazardous materials , and crime in schools - essentially FEMA ' s menu . The job of top dog at FEMA was almost tailor-made for General Giuffrida. // In crowded Washington , where clout is measured by how many square feet of real estate an agency covers , FEMA recently gathered its scattered forces from 14 locations throughout the city into a brand new eight-story building near the Smithsonian Institution . In fact , it bumped out another agency which was scheduled to move in - one small indication of FEMA ' s importance to the Reagan administration. // The new building has a new official seal , designed by General Giuffrida himself . The motto , ' ' Service in Peace and War , ' ' stems from General Giuffrida ' s desire to be understood as more than a flood-control agency or as a paranoid harbinger of World War III . Aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bridge between national defense and the people being defended - ensuring ' ' a balance between what we need on the defense side , and the rest of the nation and economy . . . without which the Defense Department would be essentially meaningless. ' ' // FEMA employees made an office joke out of one magazine article that described the agency as a ' ' shadow government . ' ' Nothing so sinister , as far as General Giuffrida is concerned . ' ' We ' re not doomsday prophets , ' ' he emphasizes . But it would be imprudent not to recognize the possibility for the occurrence of nuclear war and other crises , ' ' and it ' s our responsibility both legally and morally to have done as much pre-planning as we can do.
