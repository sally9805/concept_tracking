Tempest in an oil barrel <P> Had three of the world 's largest and richest oil companies been caught cheating a major OPEC oil-producing nation out of $6.1 billion ? Or was it simply that the OPEC producer was attempting to blame the oil companies for the missing money in order to cover up its own administrative incompetence ? <P> For a briefly tantalizing moment last week , those were the questions being asked in the world of Big Oil . Breathless dispatches out of Lagos , Nigeria , hinted at an erupting major scandal . On one side were the Royal Dutch/Shell Group , Mobil and Gulf Oil . Arrayed against them was the ten-month-old civilian government of President Alhaji Shehu Shagari , which seemed to be charging that the oil companies had somehow or other tricked it out of 183 million bbl. of high-quality Nigerian crude . The government appeared to demand that the oil be either returned or paid for . The situation took on added importance because Nigeria is the U.S. 's largest supplier of crude oil ( 923,000 bbl. a day ) after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the diverting little drama than met the eye . Though front-page stories in the U.S. anxiously warned that the action by Nigeria had dealt a serious blow to oil companies and consumers alike , the Shagari government had done nothing of the kind . The stillborn scandal really amounted to something considerably different from what the overeager press reporting in Lagos and the U.S. implied . <P> The confusion began a year ago when the Punch , a newspaper that is more noted for its third-page cheesecake than its investigative prowess , reported that approximately $5 billion was missing from the accounts of the government-run Nigerian National Petroleum Corp . In response to the charges , the newly installed Shagari government last spring appointed a five-man tribunal to investigate . The group 's report , which was released two weeks ago , noted that the government 's oil records were a shambles , but that there was no evidence of any missing funds . <P> Instead the tribunal concluded that during the years 1975-78 , when Nigerian crude was not selling well because of a short-lived world oil glut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nigeria 's normal production of some 2 million bbl. daily , had cut back production , at the government 's request , to an average of about 1.7 million bbl. a day . Traditionally , the companies had been splitting their production on a 45%-55% basis with the government , for daily liftings of about 1 million bbl. of crude . In order to stay at that level , the companies kept somewhat more of the reduced daily production for themselves and delivered somewhat less to the government . <P> The Nigerian government settled for that arrangement in hopes of offsetting as much revenue loss as possible . The oil companies continued to pay the same taxes and royalties , even though overall Nigerian production had declined . <P> Now , with oil prices nearly triple what they were two years ago , the Nigerians want to start pumping some of the oil that they left untapped before , and the real issue between the two sides boils down to who is going to pay the cost of pumping it out of the ground . That is something the three companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
