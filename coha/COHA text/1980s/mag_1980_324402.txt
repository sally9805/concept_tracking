The network of independent trade unions now being formed represents the wild card in Poland 's economic future . " The question , " says a West European diplomat in Warsaw , " is whether they will behave like British unions , which are interested only in their own demands , regardless of the cost to the nation , or whether they will , like West German unions , moderate their demands so as not to harm the overall economy . " Poles at large were generally aware of that danger . The country 's economy , as Communist Party Official Mieczyslaw Rakowski describes it , " already resembles a punching bag hanging from a thin thread . " <P> The problems began , paradoxically , with a decision that was at first applauded . To avoid the unrest that had top pled his predecessor , Wladyslaw Gomulka , in 1970 , recently ousted Party Chief Edward Gierek embarked on a crash program to modernize Polish industry . The first results were impressive . From 1971 to 1975 industrial output soared 70% , and real wages rose at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plan ran into a combination of bad luck and hurdles endemic in the Communist system . Recession in the West curbed appetites for Polish exports . Bad harvests forced Warsaw to buy increasing amounts of food abroad . Meanwhile , the government lost control of the development program and had to seek further loans , pushing its hard-currency indebtedness to a staggering $20 billion . <P> Last winter the then Premier , Edward Babiuch , imposed an austerity policy designed to limit Poland 's foreign debt . Creditors were pleased but the population reacted with mounting resentment . It was thus not surprising that public anger should have broken out in July when the government reduced its heavy meat-price subsidies and allowed prices to rise sharply . <P> The concessions made to Labor Leader Lech Walesa and his colleagues in Gdansk will , in the short run , worsen the economic picture . Not only will national income decline as a result of the strikes , but the promised wage increases will cost the government an inflationary $3 billion . <P> Foreign assistance will help , but only to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods and hard currency . President Carter has pledged $670 million in credits for U.S. grain and other foodstuffs . Western banks have arranged for new loans totaling $1 billion . These are stopgap measures . Polish economists agree that further belt tightening and a program of profound economic reform will both be necessary . One proposal : decentralization of economic decision making so as to give plant managers more responsibility . This will even include the introduction of a profit motive . Most experts also believe that the pricing system will have to be made more responsive to supply and demand . However , the Polish workers have resisted that reform ever since 1970 . Would Polish workers accept such policies ? Some opposition figures , like Dissident Leader Jacek Kuron , respond that the workers will indeed swallow bitter economic medicine-if their sacrifices are rewarded by a genuine liberalization of the political system .
