 | Thanks to brisk economic growth , rising profits , low inflation and other rosy indicators , 1984 has in many ways seemed the best of times . So why has this year brought 65 failures among financial institutions , more than any year in recent history ? not to mention a run on large deposits at the country 's biggest thrift , American Savings , and the forced " nationalization " of giant Continental Illinois ? It 's a daunting question with a score of possible answers and one that is spurring intense debate among legislators , regulators and bankers . In turn , that discussion has raised another profound question : how can the nation insure that its banking system stays sound ? The issue is one of paramount importance . A healthy banking system is the lifeblood of the economy ; without it , continued growth would be impossible . But many banking experts are growing increasingly worried that major structural problems in the system are simply not being addressed . The problem is n't that financial deregulation has gone too far , many maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , there are n't enough incentives to encourage wise banking practices . Some argue that the network of regulatory agencies is too antiquated and unwieldy . Others contend that the industry has too little capital and is too insulated from the penalties of excessive risk . There is n't wide agreement on how to remedy the problems , but there are now serious proposals for change . The reasons for the banking system 's recent failures are almost as varied as the bank buildings that dot America . Recognizing the inevitable contraction under way in the industry , regulators have lately allowed many small , troubled institutions to fail . This has obliged the government to pay off depositors at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars ( chart ) . The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is estimated to have committed over a quarter of its $16.5 billion in reserves to bail out Continental ? victim of a run when large investors lost faith that it could survive huge losses on bad loans . There is just one " common thread " in these instances , says FDIC chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Part of the problem is that it 's getting easier to be a poor bank manager . The freedom that banks now have to pay any price for deposits has sparked unparalleled competition and high , volatile costs for funds . With their powers to invest those funds still largely restricted to making loans , many banks have stuffed their books with lower-quality loans . American Savings , owned by Financial Corp . of America ( FCA ) , headed by brash Charles Knapp , has sought to play other risky games ? gambling in part that it could " match " fluctuating , highinterest deposits by writing billions of dollars of fixed-rate mortgages , then selling many of these loans off and servicing them for a fee . That would have worked if interest rates had fallen , but their continued high level has caused the strategy to falter . Gap and Overlap ' : But if managers have trouble playing by the new rules , regulators may have it even worse . The six federal and 50 state agencies charged with overseeing the financial system are plagued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Richard Pratt , a Merrill Lynch executive and former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board . Many of the agencies seem understaffed : the Comptroller of the Currency , which regulates national banks , has only 2,200 examiners to oversee 4,700 institutions . And because the turnover rate among examiners is high , much of the watchdog role necessarily falls to relatively inexperienced staffers . H. Joe Selby , the comptroller 's senior deputy for bank supervision , says that few of the agency 's examiners would have had the confidence to challenge the risky energy loans made by Continental ? especially amid the hoopla about the bank 's bril-  | liance that pervaded the late 1970s . " That 's not an excuse " for poor regulation , says Selby , " but that 's a fact . " The difficulties caused by " overlap " are equally severe . A single financial institution may have to answer to as many as five different agencies , and one agency may serve as the watchdog for five different types of institutions . Inevitably , conflicts over bank practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superintendent , cites instances where state-chartered banks regulated by his department got one set of instructions if they were also regulated by the comptroller and another if they were regulated by the FDIC . Faced with different demands , some institutions go " forumshopping " ? changing their charters to come under the aegis of the most lenient agency . Many banks simply get lost in the shuffle . Andrew Carron , a former Brookings Institution economist now with Shearson Lehman/American Express , thinks regulatory " balkanization " is the main reason the Tennessee-based banks owned by Jake and C. H. Butcher got into trouble and eventually failed . To redress some of these problems , a commission chaired by Vice President George Bush earlier this year recommended overhauling the existing regulatory network . Under its proposals , which could be submitted as legislation to Congress next year , the comptroller 's office would be replaced by a new Federal Banking Agency . The FBA would regulate all national banks and all but the 50 largest bank-holding companies , which in turn would still be overseen by the Federal Reserve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance , while any securities activities that banks got into would be monitored by the Securities and Exchange Commission . Those proposals represent some improvement over the current system , but many banking experts argue that the banks are plagued by problems that no amount of more vigilant oversight can correct . Among the remedies they envision : A Need for New Capital Economist Alan Greenspan argues that a central problem for the industry is that its assets are mainly long-term , its deposits are mainly shortterm ? and it has inadequate capital ( mainly shareholders ' equity and retained earnings ) to guard against the disasters that could result . Recognizing this , regulators have recently moved to require some banks to increase capital as a percentage of overall assets . Isaac of the FDIC thinks capital requirements should be raised to as high as 9 percent of total assets from the current average for commercial banks of 5.5 percent . But Robert Albertson , an analyst at Smith Barney , Harris Upham &; Co. , doubts that such a change would make much difference : no amount of increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Continental Illinois once depositors made up their minds that the bank was finished . @# A Better System of Deposit Insurance . Many banking experts argue that for the federal government to insure deposits up to $100,000 ? and frequently to bail out still larger depositors , as in the case of Continental ? encourages banks to take undue risks with depositors ' funds . Some have suggested revamping the system to impose " market discipline " on the banks . One proposal would compel institutions to pay the federal government different rates for deposit insurance based on their level of capital or the quality of their assets ; another would exempt the first 1 to 2 percent of a depositor 's assets from insurance coverage . Institutions taking big risks would thus incur some financial penalty , while depositors would be forced to be more watchful of bank policy . But Harvard Business School Prof. Samuel L. Hayes III argues that removing full insurance coverage from small deposits would sharply undermine confidence in the banking system . " We still are not that far away from the 1930s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance at the University of Southern California , maintains that many institutions ? especially thrifts ? would quickly go broke paying premiums pegged to their level of risk . More Disclosure of Information . Many regulators believe that confidence in the banking system could be increased by forcing banks to disclose more detail about their business . Last year the SEC demanded that publicly owned bank-holding companies reveal more information about the health of foreign loans , and the FDIC recently asked banks to divulge more detail in their quarterly reports to the agency . But the federal agencies have encountered some opposition from the Office of Management and Budget . Charged with overseeing the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 , the OMB has denied some of the requests for information on the ground that they will increase red tape . None of these proposals represents a panacea for the industry , and given the problems inherent in implementing them , it is unlikely many of them will ever be enacted . At best , Campbell of USC expects an evolution toward new methods of regulation : " We 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed one after another and gradually the system will change , " he says . Meanwhile , last Friday , the tiny Hereford State Bank of Hereford , Colo. , became the 65th financial institution to fail in 1984 . The FDIC paid off $2.5 million in deposits ? and a tiny piece of the banking system died .
