" I yam what I yam , " shrugs Popeye the Sailor , which may be easy for him to say . But just try being Popeye for a while , as Robin Williams did while making a Robert Altman film about the old gob , set for release in December . Not only did the actor have to master a vocabulary of malapropisms far more complex than the nano-nanos of Mork from Ork . He had to cavort under the fierce Malta sun , wearing thick rubber arm pads to simulate the cartoon sailor 's anvil forearms . He had to squint perpetually out of his left eye , speak in what he describes as a Liquid Wrench voice and consume untold quantities of canned spinach . Shelley Duvall 's role as Olive Oyl was not much easier . " I had shin splints for weeks from those size-14 , quintuple-A boots , " she groans . Not to mention anvil forearms from toting Swee ' Pea ( Wesley Ivan Hurt ) around and neck strain from craning to Oylesque proportions . Toughest of all was stifling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in costume , we just laughed at each other . " <P> <P> Boston may be 350 years old , but it celebrates its birthday like a little kid . No Tea Party , it was ice cream and cake for 12,000 who gathered in Boston Common for the conclusion of the city 's five-month Jubilee 350 celebration . Naturally the goodies were scaled to suit the town 's venerability : a 2,000-lb. creamy fudge sundae and a 14-ft. by 6-ft. field of butter-creamed pound cake adorned with a 5-ft. marzipan replica of historic Faneuil Hall . The cake , a six-month construction project for Entenmann 's Bakery and a local architectural firm , was surrounded , of course , by 350 candles . Kevin White , 51 , mayor of Boston for what seems like most of its history , lit the first candle and then was mercifully brief in his remarks to the drooling crowd : " This may be the only time that the phrase ' Let them eat cake ' can be said both compassionately and joyously . " Some four hours later , all 1,800 lbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope , compassionately . <P> <P> " Detroit has a world-class orchestra that is supported in a provincial way , " huffed Detroit Symphony Orchestra Conductor Antal Dorati in an open letter to Orchestra Chairman Robert B. Semple . Therefore , said the maestro with characteristic bravado , I quit . Under Dorati , who arrived three years ago , the D.S.O. has become one of the crown jewels of the struggling " Detroit renaissance . " So Semple acted fast . In a six-way conference call with Dorati at his home in Switzerland , board members urged the maestro to come back , at least for this season . Pleased with the furor he had created , Dorati agreed : " The city had to wake up and I sounded the alarm clock . " He plans to do more than that . Next April 9 , his 75th birthday , Dorati will donate $50,000 to the orchestra . Says he : " There are quite a few people in Detroit who , if they gave in the same proportion to their own wealth , would have to come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
