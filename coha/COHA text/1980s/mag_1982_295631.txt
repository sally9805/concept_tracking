Support builds for a 5 gas tax to create 320,000 jobs <P> It would take a " palace coup , " declared President Reagan at a news conference Sept. 28 , to get him to raise taxes , specifically gasoline taxes . As matters turned out , it took only a moderate insurrection . In a curtsy to congressional pressure for legislation to ease unemployment , the President last week endorsed a 5-per-gal. increase in the gasoline tax to finance repair of the nation 's highways , bridges and urban mass-transit systems and , not incidentally , to create overall an estimated 320,000 jobs . The measure produced an Olympian display of semantic gymnastics at the White House . First of all , argued Reagan , it is not really a tax but a " user 's fee . " What is more , insisted Reagan to a throng of reporters moments before leaving for a five-day Thanksgiving break at his ranch in Santa Barbara , Calif. , " it is not a jobs bill . We 'd be doing this if there were no recession at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranks thinned at the polls in November by 26 seats , some over the issue of rising unemployment , there are growing signs that the Administration is eager to patch more than potholes . Even Senate Majority Leader Howard H. Baker Jr . made it clear to the President soon after the election that he intended to link arms with the Democratic leadership in the House against joblessness , with or without Reagan 's support . Some of the Administration 's other moves last week may not win any new points on the Hill . A draft proposal to treat unemployment benefits as taxable income , under consideration by an Administration task force , was leaked , perhaps inadvertently , to reporters in Santa Barbara on Thanksgiving Day . Pressed for clarification , White House Spokesman Larry Speakes suggested that the tax 's purpose was to make unemployment " less attractive " to the jobless , a comment that ignited a fire storm of outrage from organized labor and congressional Democrats . The next day the President publicly backed away from the notion , said to be the brainchild of Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Advisers . Also under discussion at the White House are such proposals as a subminimum wage for youth and tax credits for employers who hire the chronically jobless . The Administration has no plans to send any of these options to Capitol Hill during the current lameduck session . <P> As of week 's end , however , the Administration was holding firm on one other idea , even though Baker and House Speaker Tip O'Neill have publicly cold-shouldered it . Administration strategists say they may send up legislation to move up the effective date of his third-year 10% tax cut from July 1 , 1983 , to Jan. 1 , 1983 . The change would cost the Treasury an estimated $14 billion in forgone revenues over the six-month period . Baker was far from the only G.O.P. power to pooh-pooh the plan . As Senate Finance Committee Chairman Robert Dole drolly commented , " There may be better ways to stimulate the economy . " <P> Despite little enthusiasm in most Washington circles , Reagan is expected to recommend his plan at a meeting with congressional leaders this week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House aide , who sees it as a counterpoint to Reagan 's conciliation on the gas tax and as a bargaining tool with Congress .
