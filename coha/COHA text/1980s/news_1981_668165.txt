To be No. 1 , you have to play the best . Austin Prep finally has learned that lesson . After years of Merrimack Valley Conference supremacy ending in tournament frustrations , Austin Prep has strengthened its schedule this year in hopes of improving its own destiny in the state tournament . " Coming from the East of the Merrimack Valley Conference , you can ' t expect to step into the states and be sharp , " says Austin Prep coach Brian Hayes . " We ' d get blown out if we didn ' t play tougher opponents . " So often that ' s been the case in recent years . A weak Merrimack schedule was merely a waltz for Austin Prep . Scores like , 12-2 , 13-1 , were very common . But then came the tourney . . . where Austin Prep didn ' t fare so well . " We ' ve tried to line up some good nonleague competition this year , " says Hayes . Acton-Boxboro , rated second in The Globe hockey poll , was added , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusett ' s power . " We also plan to play the Harvard Jayvees to keep us sharp , " says Hayes . Hayes hopes it will sharpen his skaters for a run at the EMass tourney . Last year , Austin Prep fell to St. John ' s Prep , 7-3 , in the second round . This year , though , the ending may be different . Austin Prep is off to a 7-1 start , with wins over Chelmsford ( 3-1 ) and Billerica ( 4- 3 ) . " The win over Billerica was a confidence booster , " says Hayes . " So many times they ' ve beaten us out in the Merrimack Conference . " This is a different type of team than Austin Prep usually has , " say Hayes . " There are no stars this year . Just a nice mixture of young and old . The older kids bail us out when the game gets tough , but the young kids are coming along . These kids are working hard . They really go crazy in practice . Every practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids jell by late January , we should have a respectable tourney team . " That , along with the improved schedule , could spell success for Austin Prep . " Some of the scores we had this year aren ' t an indication of how powerful we are , " says Hayes , citing the work of forwards Rich Jackson , Dave Knowlton , Fran Murray , defenseman Blaise McDonald , Dave Nelson and goalie Peter Raymond . - The US Junior National hockey team has returned from Germany after competing in the World Junior Hockey Championships ( Dec. 28- Jan. 2 ) . And although there were no medals to show , its sixth place finish in an eight-team field deserves mention . After losing three straight , Finland ( 8-1 ) , Sweden ( 10-2 ) , Germany ( 4-2 ) , the US juniors responded with a 7-3 victory over Canada and 6-2 win against Austria . St. John ' s Bob Carpenter scored six goals and five assists in the series , including the hat trick and two assists against Canada .
