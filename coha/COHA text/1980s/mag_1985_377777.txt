London theater , like Broadway , has had less than a banner year . No new Amadeus , The Real Thing , Cats or Nicholas Nickleby , no groundbreaking experience , has emerged to take the West End and then America by acclaim . The difference is that when Broadway falters , production slows to a trickle and half the theaters are dark . In London there is always plenty to see , including , at the moment , as many American musicals as on Broadway , at roughly a third of Broadway prices . Shows open and close more quickly in London than in New York City , where financial success usually depends on a long run : visitors earlier this summer could have enjoyed Liv Ullmann in Old Times , Charlton Heston in The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial , Deborah Kerr in The Corn Is Green and Alan Bates in Dance of Death . Currently , Lauren Bacall is starring in Sweet Bird of Youth , and Vanessa Redgrave in The Seagull . <P> The West End offers at least one major new play , Breaking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waste , a dizzying story of political corruption , and Tom Stoppard 's Jumpers , a cascade of coruscating epigrams coupled with glimpses of gymnasts , astronauts , concupiscent doctors and murdered rabbits , all in the arcane service of condemning modern epistemological philosophy . <P> Despite this commercial abundance , some of the hottest tickets are for productions at the subsidized National Theater and Royal Shakespeare Company . Both suffered cutbacks when their Arts Council grants were announced this spring , and the National 's director , Peter Hall , temporarily closed his experimental Cottesloe stage . Some critics wondered if there might be a connection between the dispute and productions that have endorsed leftist views or attacked the conservatism of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher . The National 's Pravda , for example , seems to say that the worst sin of Fleet Street is generosity toward Thatcher . The R.S.C. 's Today is a paean to men who abandoned their homes and families to fight as Communists in the Spanish Civil War . <P> The most conspicuous and skillful example of a leftward tilt is the R.S.C.

But in Director Adrian Noble 's post-Falklands vision , the play becomes a chronicle of doomed and bloody consequences of meddling abroad . In its most striking visual image , the names of the dead from the Battle of Agincourt are inscribed on a scrim resembling the Viet Nam memorial wall in Washington . This sobering reminder of the wages of war remains onstage during the final lighthearted scenes , when the King shifts from fighter to lover , as if to mock his charm . The production is vigorous , persuasive , at moments unforgettable , and in Kenneth Branagh , 24 , it features a potential heir to the legacy of Olivier , Richardson and Gielgud . Branagh has the animal magnetism of a leading man and the cerebral fire and ice of a character actor . He brings off the hortatory set pieces of command with howling fervor and excels at the gentle comedy of courtship , pouring his heart into the cracked vessel of his schoolboy French as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
