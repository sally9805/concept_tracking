NEW YORK  --  Finance companies , trying to save money on interest payments , are rushing to market offerings of " put bonds . " Since August , when the first such corporate offering was made , 12 companies have issued $1. 4 billion of put bonds , which are so named because investors can " put , " or sell back , the securities at a specified date before the bonds mature . Corporations issuing put bonds are taking a risk , investment bankers note , because they can ' t force investors to sell the bonds back to them if market rates drop . If rates are higher when the put date comes , the investors will redeem the bonds at face value and the company will have to refinance at a higher rate . But if rates are lower , the investors will keep the bonds , preventing issuers from refinancing the debt at a lower rate . Ordinarily , investors who want to sell lower-yielding bonds when rates rise have to take a loss , since bond prices fall when interest rates climb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investors are willing to accept a substantially lower return . For example , the rate on the first of Associates Corp. of North America ' s three put bond issues " may have been 40 to 45 basis points " below what the company ordinarily would have had to pay , James E. Jack , executive vice president and chief financial officer , said . A basis point is 1/100 of a percentage point . As a result , Associates saved as much as $450 , 000 a year in interest costs on its $100 million issue . " The product suits the needs of the investing community where nobody knows what will happen to rates , " says Jason M. Elsas Jr. , a managing director at Salomon Brothers Inc. , lead manager on half the offerings made so far . From the investor ' s point of view , he explains , a 10-year bond with a five-year put  --  the most common variety  --  represents a five-year investment with an option to invest for another five years at the same rate . " Investors are willing to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' re better off if interest rates stay where they are , " says Francis D. Pedersen , senior vice president , finance , at Walter E. Heller &; Co . Heller issued a $75 million 10-year bond with a five-year put last month , and came back to market for another $75 million this week . The second offering was for eight years , with a four-year put . Mr. Pedersen said that although he expects " peaks and valleys " in interest-rate movements , he doesn ' t expect huge changes over the life of Heller ' s issues . If rates stay level , and investors keep the bonds , Heller will have saved even more . The 12. 45% yield on Heller ' s second offering , 49 basis points below what the company would have had to pay on a four-year bond without the put feature , is about 60 basis points below its rate on a straight eight-year bond , a Salomon official estimates . Another issuer , however , looks at the risk question differently . " We ' re not betting on interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company whose bond had a 10-year maturity with a four-year put . " We are selling four-year paper , " he said . " If it sticks for 10 years , nifty . " Mr. Jack of Associates , whose third issue had two puts , at six and eight years , agrees that put bonds should be issued only by companies that are equally willing to finance for the full maturity or only to the put dates . For that reason , he notes , the bonds are especially attractive to finance companies such as his . " They are definitely tailored very , very well to what financial institutions want , " he said . Because Associates ' assets are financial , Mr. Jack explained , it continually has money available for refinancing . If rates drop and the company is stuck with its put bonds , it can refinance another piece of debt to take advantage of the lower rates . The company ' s three put bond issues represent only $300 million of Associates ' $2. 6 billion of long-term debt , he noted , adding that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself with put bonds . " We wouldn ' t want to get greedy , " he said .
