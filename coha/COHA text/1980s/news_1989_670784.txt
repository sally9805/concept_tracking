From March 1980 to August 1981 an investment company owned by Mr. Wright and his close friend , George A. Mallick , saw its investment in the Delhi International Oil Corporation stock triple in value and then sold only days before the stock crashed . The two friends also doubled their investment when they bought and sold stock in the Supron Energy Corporation in the same period. // Mallightco Inc. , the investment company in which Mr. Wright , Mr. Mallick and their wives were partners , collected more than $130 , 000 in revenue on the two deals. // A substantial profit on the Delhi stock was also collected by Sedco Inc. , a Dallas oil company , then largely owned by Gov . Bill Clements of Texas , a Republican , and his family , which bought and sold large blocks of Delhi shares about the same time as Mallightco , filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show . <> <> Transactions Not Disclosed // Mr. Wright did not disclose his interests in the two oil companies until he amended his financial disclosure statements in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark Johnson , an aide to the Congressman . The committee formally opened its inquiry into Mr. Wright ' s finances three months later. // Details of the stock transactions were made public last week when the committee released a 279-page report by Richard J. Phelan , the Chicago lawyer it hired to examine allegations that Mr. Wright violated House rules in his business dealings . The report shows that during the boom years of the Texas oil economy Mr. Wright was an active investor , regularly using borrowed funds to enter speculative deals with his friends. // Mr. Phelan , the special outside counsel , recommended that the committee spend more time examining two such deals. // The Committee on Standards of Official Conduct , as the ethics committee is known officially , agreed to investigate a transaction in 1988 between Mallightco and the Jaffe family of San Antonio , which is active in Democratic Party politics and friends of Mr. Wright . Mallightco earned a profit of $342 , 000 by buying and selling its interests in an oil well on the same day , even though there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Five major witnesses , including Morris D. Jaffe and his son M. D. ( Doug ) Jaffe who were major brokers of that transaction , refused to testify when key committee members visited San Antonio earlier this week. // Mr. Phelan ' s only other call for further investigation involved Mallightco ' s profitable trading in Delhi ( pronounced DEL-high ) and Supron stock . The committee did not mention these transactions in a statement listing 69 alleged violations of House ethics rules by Mr. Wright , and it went on to announce a further investigation of the Jaffe transaction . <> <> More Investigating Urged // " If it was not included in the committee report , you can presume the committee is not pursuing it further , " a member of the committee staff said of Mr. Phelan ' s recommendation on the Delhi and Supron transactions. // Mr. Phelan stated in his report , " With respect to the securities transactions made by Mallightco , we can not yet determine whether or not any violations of House rules has occurred. " // He concluded : " Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Delhi International Oil and Supron Energy Corp . The magnitude of Mallightco ' s profit and the possibility that Mallick or Wright had some non-public information make further investigation necessary . " <> <> Disclosures Came Later // In his financial disclosure reports between 1980 and 1986 Mr. Wright listed his Mallightco holdings . But he did not list either Mallightco ' s assets , like the Delhi and Supron stock , or the transactions carried out for Mallightco by Mr. Mallick , a wealthy Fort Worth real estate developer . In 1987 , when Mr. Wright put most of his assets in a blind trust , he agreed with the ethics committee to reveal Mallightco ' s assets in amended disclosure statements for the previous years. // Mr. Johnson , of the Speaker ' s office , said Mr. Wright ' s decision to amend his disclosure statements came about after discussions with the ethics committee . The committee ' s rules require that special circumstances be explained to justify amendments to disclosure statements more than a year old . The amended statements list Mallightco ' s assets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government Act of 1978 members of Congress and some Federal employees are required to file annual financial disclosure statements that ask for information in such categories as income , liabilities and gifts. // Under the heading " Transactions " the disclosure form for House members requests " a brief description , the date and category of value of any purchase , sale or exchange during the calendar year which exceeded $1 , 000 in real property , or in stocks , bonds , commodities futures , or other forms of securities . " Mr. Wright has disclosed purchases and sales he undertook himself , but not those conducted by Mallightco. // Mallightco acquired 1 , 500 shares of Delhi stock on March 19 , 1980 , for $39 , 150 with money it had borrowed , according to Mr. Phelan ' s report . It was the first major transaction by Mallightco after it was formed in August 1979 and it was to prove the most successful effort until the transaction with the Jaffes in 1988 , just before Mr. Wright withdrew from what he has called " a little investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed erratically because the small Dallas-based company had been considered a takeover target . Much of the takeover speculation centered on Sedco , Governor Clement ' s company , which began buying Delhi stock on March 25 , eventually buying a 12 percent interest in the company , according to the S.E.C. filings. // Mallightco sold half its Delhi shares in June 1980 for nearly $38 , 000 . In August 1980 , both Mallightco and Sedco sold their stakes in Delhi just days before Delhi executives announced that no successful bidder had emerged in their efforts to find a buyer for the company . Mallightco took a profit of nearly $83 , 000 on the transactions while Sedco ' s profits amounted to more than $24. 5 million . The day of Delhi ' s announcement its stock plunged , losing nearly a third of its value. // Both Delhi and Supron , the other stock bought and sold for a large profit by Mallightco in this period , were " very volatile , very hot properties that attracted a lot of people in this part of the country because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " according to Frederick E. Rowe , a Dallas-based oil stock analyst. // Mr. Wright used most of his earnings from the stock transactions to buy into a tax shelter based on oil drilling rights , Mr. Phelan reported. // Mr. Mallick , who carried out the stock transactions for Mallightco , refused a request for an interview on these dealings. // Spokesmen for the S.E.C. in Fort Worth and in Washington said there was no record of any actions taken against either Delhi or Supron . Since the S.E.C. is a civil agency , there is no statute of limitation on its investigations . The commission does not offer any public comment as to whether transactions are the subjects of investigation until there is a decision to take action. //
