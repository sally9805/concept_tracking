Israel 's Crisis <P> To the Editors : <P> After reading your cover story on Israel Oct. 4 , I believe more than ever that the Begin government has got to go . It is time for Israel to find a leader who will serve the interests of that nation before there is no nation left to serve . <P> Eric R. Lunde Holland , Mich . <P> <P> The worst fears of the P.L.O . have come true . Palestinian refugees can not depend on the ill-equipped and ill-trained Lebanese army for protection . In the aftermath of the P.L.O . ' s departure from Beirut , the world has a moral obligation to protect the Palestinians who still remain there . <P> Saifur Rahman Blacksburg , Va . <P> <P> How many more Palestinians must be killed before President Reagan exerts pressure to stop arms deliveries to Israel ? Only the creation of a Palestinian state and the official recognition of Israel by the Arabs will ensure an end to this terror . <P> Herbert Frei Zurich <P> Maybe the massacres at Sabra and Shatila will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alert . If Arabs could do such things to Arabs , imagine what they would do to Israelis . When the P.L.O . killed women and children in Israel , we saw dancing in Arab streets , not antigovernment demonstrations . <P> Sara Cohen Toronto <P> I am among the many sickened by the massacre in Beirut . I also believe Ariel Sharon was guilty of criminal negligence in allowing revenge-filled Christian forces into the Palestinian camps . But how about a sense of proportion in dealing with the tragedy ? Let us not use the word Holocaust lightly . There has been nothing comparable in Lebanon or elsewhere to Hitler 's deliberate campaign to murder all European Jews , which resulted in the death of 6 million . <P> Maxwell Finger New York City <P> Israel at least has the decency to feel a moral responsibility in the deaths of so many . The Lebanese who committed these acts apparently feel nothing . <P> Marcia Desbien Burnsville , Minn . <P> <P> The whole Middle East is an abyss of injustice . <P> Walter J. Sokira Jr . Cuyahoga Falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if crops are good or bad ; the farm problem never goes away Oct. 4 . As a retiree on a limited income , I can rarely afford butter , steak , asparagus or roast . While I am using margarine , my taxes are being used in part to pay for butter , which the Federal Government will be giving away . It makes me sick . <P> Elizabeth Jessup Elmhurst , III . <P> The U.S. Government should buy up most of the surplus grain and convert it into alcohol for gasohol . This would sop up the grain glut . <P> Esther Koch Azalea , Ore . <P> Short-Cut Bible <P> I am amazed the Reader 's Digest company would have the audacity to digest the Bible Oct. 4 . Next the editors will offer a shortened version of the Constitution . <P> ( The Rev. ) John E. Eliason Burlington , N.C. <P> Did God die and leave Reader 's Digest in charge ? With this new version of the Bible , people will know only 60% of God and will make false assumptions about the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Editor Metzger 's hope is to encourage people to read the whole Bible , he would have had a better chance if he had just removed all the " Thou shalt nots .
