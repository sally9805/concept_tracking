Labor and Likud agree to rotate the prime ministership <P> At long last , two months after the final votes were counted in the national elections , Israelis learned who their next Prime Minister would be . Or did they ? In three days of tough bargaining last week , Labor Party Leader Shimon Peres agreed to alternate as Prime Minister with the Likud bloc 's Yitzhak Shamir in a national unity government . For nearly four weeks , Peres had been trying to build a coalition with Shamir , but the Likud chieftain refused to accept Peres as the country 's leader . Peres concluded that he could break the stalemate and form a new government only by sharing Israel 's top post with Shamir . Said Peres after a two-hour meeting with Shamir on Friday : " We made quite a headway , yet our work is not complete . " <P> Under the deal , one party leader would be Prime Minister for 25 months , the other would take over for the following 25 months . Labor and Likud planned to continue negotiating on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to assign the 24 posts in the new Cabinet . One of last week 's proposals called for the positions to be divided evenly between the two camps , but exactly how remains in dispute . According to Peres ' scenario , he would initially head the government , with a deputy prime ministership and the Foreign and Finance ministries going to rival Likud forces ; the Defense Ministry would be given to Labor . Shamir , on the other hand , promised that if he is allowed to be Prime Minister first , Labor would have the courtesy of naming both the Foreign and Defense ministers . Shamir insisted , however , that if Peres went first , Likud should get those two key portfolios . Responded a leading Labor politician : " If that 's what they are demanding , forget it . " <P> Peres has problems within his own ranks as well . He has already promised the Defense post to Yitzhak Rabin , his bitter rival and Israel 's Prime Minister from 1974 to 1977 . Rabin still enjoys strong support within Labor ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed in scuttling a national unity agreement . In addition Mapam , a leftist party that holds six of Labor 's 44 seats in the 120-member Knesset , has threatened to quit the Labor alignment if a Labor-Likud government is formed . <P> Mapam leaders feel that Peres has made too many concessions to the right-wing Likud bloc and are upset by position papers , drafted jointly by Labor and Likud , to guide the unity government 's policies . Initially , Peres had wanted the agreement to specify that any new Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank would have to be approved by two-thirds of the Cabinet , but he is now leaning toward a simple majority vote . " It was a very sad meeting , " said Mapam Leader Victor Shentov , after Peres told him of the plan to share the prime ministership . " We have a historical mission to be a party that presents its views clearly to fight the growing extremism in this country .

" Why should we then give Peres the preference ? " asked a Shamir aide .
