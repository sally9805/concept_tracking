Agent Orange 's victims step up demands for compensation <P> The young men had expected long ago to have memories of the Viet Nam War behind them and concentrate on their growing families and civilian careers . But when 300 Long Island , N.Y. , veterans , wives and children met at St. Peter 's Episcopal Church in Bay Shore , they exchanged tales of a terror that has deformed their lives . Jim Albrigtsen , 30 , is in almost constant pain from pus-filled lumps under his skin . Mike Ryan , 34 , has recovered from a similar affliction , but his eight-year-old daughter Kerry has 18 birth defects , including missing bones in her right arm and intestinal malformations . Ronald De Boer , 31 , has a healthy three-year-old daughter but doubts that he will father any more children ; he has lost one testicle to cancer , which is extremely rare in a man that young . <P> The former soldiers are united by more than their pain ; they gathered to hear a report on what may be the biggest product-liability case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With some 3,000 other Viet Nam veterans across the country , they are plaintiffs in a suit against five companies that made a defoliant called Agent Orange , which the veterans believe is the cause of their maladies . <P> The Air Force sprayed Agent Orange heavily over Viet Nam to lay bare thousands of acres of jungle in which Viet Cong guerrillas were thought to be hiding . An Army handout for one such mission , Operation Ranch Hand in 1966 , assured the troops that " the sprayed chemical is nontoxic to human or animal life . " But Agent Orange was contaminated by a byproduct of the manufacturing process , dioxin , which is perhaps the most toxic synthetic chemical known . When a few pounds of it were released into the air by an explosion at an Italian chemical plant in 1976 , more than 700 people in the town of Seveso were evacuated . Some of them have never been allowed to return to their homes , which are still contaminated . About 350 lbs . of dioxin were contained in the 11 million gal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can cause a variety of torments , including a skin disorder called chloracne , liver damage and cancer . In addition , a researcher for the Food and Drug Administration once estimated that dioxin is " 100,000 to a million times more potent " than thalidomide in causing birth defects among the children of people exposed to it . <P> Veterans , and their children who were conceived after the war , began displaying symptoms identical to those known to be caused by dioxin poisoning shortly after the servicemen returned to the U.S. , but they and their doctors long failed to connect their illnesses to Agent Orange . After reading about the Seveso incident , however , Paul Reutershan , a veteran who was suffering from cancer of the colon , filed suit in 1977 . He died the next year , at age 28 , but by then Victor Yannacone Jr. , the lawyer who had brought the 1966 suit that helped ban DDT , had taken up his case . The defendants are Dow Chemical Co. , Monsanto Co. , Thompson-Hayward Chemical Co. , Hercules Inc. and Diamond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
