Philosophers refurbish the tools of reason to sharpen arguments for theism <P> God ? Was n't he chased out of heaven by Marx , banished to the unconscious by Freud and announced by Nietzsche to be deceased ? Did not Darwin drive him out of the empirical world ? Well , not entirely . In a quiet revolution in thought and argument that hardly anyone could have foreseen only two decades ago , God is making a comeback . Most intriguingly , this is happening not among theologians or ordinary believers-most of whom never accepted for a moment that he was in any serious trouble-but in the crisp , intellectual circles of academic philosophers , where the consensus had long banished the Almighty from fruitful discourse . <P> Now it is more respectable among philosophers than it has been for a generation to talk about the possibility of God 's existence . The shift is most striking in the Anglo-American academies of thought , where strict forms of empiricism have reigned . " What science can not tell us , mankind can not know , " declared Bertrand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positivism , decreed that " all utterances about the nature of God are nonsensical . " The accepted wisdom was that the only , valid statements were those verifiable through the senses . <P> Today even atheistic philosophers agree that Ayer 's rigid rule is inadequate to deal with human experience . Meanwhile , science , his model for learning , has become less presumptuous and ambitious , its theorizing about cosmic astronomy closer to theology , its promise as savior and absolute explainer of the world somewhat tarnished . In the era of quarks , black holes , physics can seem as baffling as foreign policy in the age of the Ayatullah . Philosophers of science , such as Thomas Kuhn of Princeton , have applied relativism , formerly employed against religion , to scientific knowledge . Cornell President Frank Rhodes , a geologist , once observed that " the qualities that scientists measure may have as little relation to the world itself as a telephone number has to its subscriber .

If you begin to doubt that there is some meaning in the process of history , then you get frightened of your own secularity , and you return to religion . " <P> Though still a distinct minority in secular universities , some philosophers are not only willing to talk about God but to believe in him . In the U.S. , 300 of them belong to the Society for Christian Philosophy . Some scholars are attacking atheism and reviving and refining arguments for theism that have been largely unfashionable since the Enlightenment , using modern techniques of analytic philosophy and symbolic logic that were once used to discredit belief . <P> A generation ago , atheistic empiricists like Harvard 's Willard V. Quine were influential simply because " they were the brightest people , " says Philosophy Professor Roderick Chisholm of Brown University , adding that now the " brightest people include theists , using a kind of tough-minded intellectualism " that was often lacking on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
