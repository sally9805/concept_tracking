By Walter V. Robinson and Lawrence Collins Globe Staff After a year as governor , Edward J. King is determined to save money for the state and keep state and local taxes from rising . But : BULLET State workers want sizable salary hikes this year , at a time when the cost of even modest pay raises is pegged at $100 million or more . BULLET The MBTA wants to exceed its approved budget by more than $70 million just to keep services at an adequate level . BULLET Inflation at 13 percent almost insures built-in cost increases for state programs that have large and vocal constituencies . BULLET A probable recession may increase unemployment , reduce taxrevenues and enlarge the pool of needy families needing state services . King in 1980 finds himself between the Scylla of demands for state services and the Charybdis of complaints that it will cost too much to provide them . The governor , whose successful 1978 campaign promised tough management and massive tax cuts , will need all his management mettle in 1980 just to keep those taxes from spiraling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts , thanks to inflation and the elusiveness of the substantial management savings King thought possible when he took office . Also missing will be a major push by King for such emotion-laden legislation as restoration of the death penalty , a lower drinking age and a halt to use of state funds for abortions . All were accomplished by the governor last year . Left facing the governor and an administration that has weathered a sometimes tempestuous shakedown cruise are the tough but mundane management issues that may in large measure write the history of the King administration . Those issues are : BULLET The state budget . Simply put , King will have to put the brake on state spending , which rose 9 percent last year , or face a deficit and the need for new state taxes . BULLET The MBTA , King ' s most visible management challenge . The governor , who took control of the system last month , must find a way to improve its service and image at a cost that won ' t bankrupt the cities and towns that help fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to take decisive action , principally through a comprehensive conservation effort , to blunt the impact of escalating energy costs on the state ' s economy and its already high cost of living . BULLET Management savings . The widespread elimination of waste in state spending that candidate King promised but Gov . King has been unable to achieve is now crucial to his commitment to hold state taxes steady . King ' s 1980 agenda will be detailed next Monday night in his State of the State address to the Legislature , with the budget , energy and his concern with better management likely to be his principal concerns . While those issues are likely to preoccupy King this year , they are not the only nettlesome problems he will confront . Beyond the dollars and cents issues that will predominate this year , King ' s own public image , at a low ebb after a year in office , is a major political concern . Just this week , King ' s chief spokesman departed and the governor has promised to beef up the staff that tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some fashion , he will have to face the now-embarrassing problem of the legislative and executive pay raise that was enacted last Halloween night but that many legislators now want repealed . And he may also have to act on legislation requiring the state to select sites for hazardous waste disposal ; revamping the way the MBTA is managed and funded ; refashioning a state contracting system that has been riddled with abuse for decades ; reorganizing an inefficient civil service system ; and providing protection for tenants threatened by displacement as a result of condominium conversions . The state budget , however , is likely to present King with his major problem this year . King , who will propose his budget for the next fiscal year in 12 days , has already issued qualified assurances that it will require no increase in state taxes . That promise , by most accounts , will be difficult to keep . By some conservative projections , if King ' s budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1 were to rise at last year ' s 9 percent rate , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be offset by new taxes . At the least , King ' s budget proposal will be unable to increase the $1.5 billion in state aid to cities and towns . With inflation running at 13 percent , the likely result is that cities and towns will be forced to raise property taxes , in some cases substantially , next year . Thanks to that same inflation rate , any increase in the state budget that falls below 9 percent is likely to mean a real cut in services . Collective bargaining pressures might also wreak havoc with King ' s hopes for a balanced budget . There are some estimates that modest collective bargaining increases well below union demands will cost the state more than $100 million in the new fiscal year . The governor ' s budget problems are compounded by the Legislature . Whether its 200 members will agree to controversial service cuts - even to avoid a tax increase - in a year when they must seek re- election is unclear . Traditionally , at least , the Legislature has added to the governor ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force a deficit , they ' ll know that the taxes needed to fund that deficit won ' t have to be enacted until the end of the fiscal year - well after the fall elections . King has said that his budget will contain economies , but will not cut essential services . " Generally speaking , " King said last week , " it doesn ' t all revolve down to cutting expenses . It revolves better down to controlling expenses . And we ' re talking about controlling ( expenses ) now when we have the highest actual inflation since the Second World War . " Whatever happens , it is clear that King ' s plans to control state spending and cut taxes have run afoul of an inflation rate he can not control . With that in mind , and with a reference to King ' s uphill fight in 1978 to unseat Gov . Michael S. Dukakis , one administration official remarked recently : " Compared to inflation , beating Dukakis was easy . " B08049845          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
