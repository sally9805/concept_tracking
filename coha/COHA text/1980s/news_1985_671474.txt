The measure , an amendment to the Defense Department ' s military programs bill , is part of a flurry of legislation prompted by Congressional concern over the arrests of three former Navy men and the son of one of them , a sailor , on espionage charges . The Government has charged that a spy ring led by John A. Walker Jr. smuggled secret Navy documents to the Soviet Union for about 20 years. // The amendment was adopted on a voice vote and would change military law , known formally as the Uniform Code of Military Justice , to include a peacetime espionage statute . Two similar bills are now being considered in the Senate. // The law would apply to active-duty personnel . Retired military workers could be returned to active duty on order of the military services and court-martialed on espionage charges , making them subject to the death penalty . But the law would not be retroactive. // The House sponsor , Representative Bill McCollum , Republican of Florida , said in an interview that the Walker case " tells us that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most heinous of crimes. " // " We need to go one step further to stop future spies from putting our nation in jeopardy , " Mr. McCollum said. // Military officials and civilians convicted of espionage in peacetime now face a maximum penalty of life in prison ; the death penalty for espionage can be applied to military personnel only in war . There is no death penalty for spies under civilian law. // Different penalties applied when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed in 1953 for conspiracy to pass secrets to the Soviet Union . Since then the Supreme Court has set new constitutional guidelines for the death penalty under civilian Federal laws , and Congress has never revised those laws to conform to the Court ' s guidelines. // Another amendment passed today would provide for a $25 million increase to $75 million in the annual budget for background investigations on military personnel who have access to classified information . The amendment also called for the Defense Department to reduce its backlog of cases needing investigation. // Like many his colleagues in Congress , Mr. McCollum said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s espionage laws . " The Walker case is egregious , but it may have some good results in terms of legislation , " he said . <> <> Defense Department Support // The Defense Department has said that it supports much of the legislation resulting from the case , which has been described as the most damaging spy case uncovered in 30 years. // At the same time , civil rights groups have complained that the legislation , particularly measures that would expand the use of the death penalty and the use of polygraph , or lie-detector , tests , could infringe on individual freedoms. // Earlier this week , the House overwhelmingly adopted a measure that would permit the Pentagon to use lie-detector tests on more than four million military and civilian employees. // The measure , another amendment to the military programs bill , would also require the tests for workers who are granted access to the highest level of classifed information . Mr. Walker , a retired Navy warrant officer who is accused of forming the spy ring , had clearance to see top-secret documents over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure approved today would not affect civilians . Nor could be it be used retroactively against the men arrested in the Walker case . The others are Mr. Walker ' s son , Michael , his brother Arthur and a friend , Jerry A. Whitworth. // The bill would not alter the punishment for crimes considered less severe than espionage , such as conspiracy to commit espionage , which now carries a maximum sentence of life in prison . Mr. Whitworth has been charged with conspiracy to commit espionage , and not espionage . <> <> Proposal Is Criticized // Mr. McCollum ' s amendment has been criticized by other members of Congress and the American Civil Liberties Union . Representative Don Edwards , Democrat of California , said that the death penalty is " utterly worthless " as a deterrent to espionage. // " Traitors for hire , like killers for hire , do not expect to be caught , " said Mr. Edwards , chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights . " For them , the difference between life imprisonment and a death sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union spokesman , said that the Walker case had " created a climate of political urgency , and unfortunately that climate appears to be resulting in rather hasty , ill-advised measures that probably will not prove effective in deterring espionage. " // Two bills before the Senate also call for the death penalty in cases of peacetime espionage . One measure , supported by the Senate majority leader , Bob Dole of Kansas , would permit the execution of both civilians and military personnel convicted of spying . The other bill was introduced by Senator Ted Stevens , Republican of Alaska . <> <> Increase in Inquiries Backed // The House also overwhelmingly approved an amendment today that would require the Defense Department to step up its investigations of people holding high-level security clearances. // The department is supposed to reinvestigate everyone cleared for access to top secret material every five years . But because of backlogs , the investigations are occurring only once every 17 years , on average. // The amendment , sponsored by Representative Les AuCoin , Democrat of Oregon , would increase the annual budget for Defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the department would also be required to cut its backlog of cases by a quarter. // " What ' s really incredible is that John Walker had a top secret clearance for 15 years and was never reinvestigated , " the Congressman said. // " We have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in improving our defenses , " he said . " And now we find that from a lack of resources in the security area , we may have just kissed a big piece of the security of this country away. " //
