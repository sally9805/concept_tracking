This week 's cover stories on the newly unified and confident Republican Party are only the first half of a journalistic doubleheader . Senior Editor Otto Friedrich had barely sent to press the main story , written by Associate Editor Edwin Warner , when he , Warner and the Nation section 's 15 other editors , writers and reporter-researchers left Manhattan to be in Detroit for the opening gavel of the G.O.P. Convention . After several days of observing the political action within and beyond the new Joe Louis Arena , they would return to their offices to prepare a second G.O.P. cover , this one on the party 's ticket and its prospects in November . Says Friedrich : " It is a great advantage to see an event firsthand , and then to be able to evaluate it from a distance . " With 4,500 members of the working press attending , the convention , as always , promised to be almost as much a gathering of journalists as of politicians . TIME 'S 13 correspondents on hand include several who have spent months scrutinizing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered Reagan since January , Walter Isaacson , who reported on last week 's G.O.P. platform hearings , and Douglas Brew , who had followed the George Bush campaign . TIME also fielded a team of ten photographers , led by Picture Editor Arnold Drapkin . <P> Our planning for Detroit began almost a year ago . Deputy Chief of Correspondents Rudolph Rauch assembled a group to arrange the complex logistics that convention coverage demands . The swift movement of staffers , information and film required the hiring of 22 messengers and a fleet of 21 cars , as well as the installation in TIME 'S pressroom in Cobo Hall of 50 telephones , two telex machines and a link to our computer in Manhattan . Other newsroom amenities : 24 desks , 38 typewriters , six pairs of binoculars and-for the fortunate-a pair of sofas . <P> The toughest problem was to find sufficient housing . After one of the twelve hotels in which TIME was allocated space turned out to be 43 miles from Detroit in Chatham , Ont. , TIME Housing Coordinator Pamela Thompson had to scramble to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the action . At one hotel being considered , a vigilant watch dog named Fifi bit Rauch 's assistant , Emily Friedrich . " After covering an acceptance speech or interviewing dozens of delegates , no one should have to cope with Fifi , " Friedrich decided , and she struck the establishment from her list .
