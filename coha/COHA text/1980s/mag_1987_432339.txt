 | Police will search and seal the manholes in Miami 's downtown streets . The State of California will close 17 miles of highway the day he says mass in Monterey . San Antonio will move a vacant house so the faithful can get a better view when he comes to visit them . And the U.S. Department of State is considering declaring a Los Angeles cathedral complex where he intends to stay the night a foreign mission . No foreign dignitary so disrupts the rhythms of American life as this traveling pontiff , John Paul II . During his first pilgrimage to the United States eight years ago , the pope attracted millions , and his second visit next month * is expected to trigger an even larger turnout . But unlike his previous visitation , when John Paul II was new to the papal throne and a novelty as the first Polish pope , Americans ? both Roman Catholics and non-Catholics ? are apt to be a good deal more critical of his performance and skeptical of his message . Not even presidential candidates at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as does a barnstorming pontiff . And while other visiting heads of state tend to thrive in private meetings , John Paul II 's goal is to reach the masses ? physically . On his way to the altar at his outdoor mass in Miami , for instance , the pope will pass directly in front of at least 300,000 faithful . In Monterey , ministers stocked with communion wafers will pilot 200 golf carts so that believers can take communion during the pope 's mass at Laguna Seca Raceway . With the pope this close to his public , federal , state and local governments will have their hands full ensuring his personal safety . The Secret Service has had to budget $5.7 million to protect him during his nine-day visit , and millions more will be spent locally . Take Miami . Security will be tightest there because President Ronald Reagan will fly down to greet the pontiff when he arrives in the United States on Sept. 10 . While pope and president confer at the edge of Biscayne Bay , armed frogmen will glide beneath the water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status reserved for hurricanes and riots , and 2,400 National Guardsmen will be on bivouac . In all , security expenses for the pope 's 23 hours in Miami will be $5.5 million . " The name of the game for a pastoral visit is contact ? exposure , " says a White House official . " The security has to be extraordinary . " To most American Catholics , of course , long lines and big crowds are worth enduring for a chance to see the pope . John Paul II will be the first pope to visit Southern and Western states , and in San Antonio , thousands of Hispanics plan to camp out overnight with beer and barbecues so they can be among the expected 500,000 at the pontiff 's 11 a.m. mass . In Detroit ? added to the itinerary to ensure the pope a rousing finale ? neighborhood windows in heavily Polish Hamtramck are already abloom with the pope 's picture . But not all Catholics are sanguine about the impending visit . Some fear the traffic snarls and mass display of papal adulation could rekindle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic bishop off the record : " He 'll be treated like a visiting monarch , which is unfortunate because lots of folks will be reminded of how differently Jesus moved among the people . " Papal PR : Other Catholics complain that the costs of the trip are egregious and would be better used for the poor . In fact , it is expected to cost the church $24 million . Archbishop John May , the president of the American Catholic hierarchy , figures this at 50 cents per Catholic ? a pittance , he argues , for a visit from their chief pastor . And Father Robert Lynch , the American bishops ' organizer of the trip , compares the @#  | price with the advertising budgets for Philip Morris and Coors Beer : " The church is spending far less for what we think is a better message than getting people to smoke cigarettes or drink beer , " he says . To help reduce costs , many Americans are donating goods and services . In San Francisco , 1,000 janitors from Union Local 87 have promised to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases of communion wine , and in Miami Cuban refugee Jorge Azze is supplying 1,300 yards of taffeta and 1,000 yards of gray sash for the vestments of 200 visiting prelates . The pope himself will be outfitted in San Antonio with a pair of hand-tooled Texas boots donated by Eddie and Jimmy Villarreal , who own a shoe-repair store . Interestingly , much of the money for the pope 's visit has come from non-Catholics . In South Carolina , where 27 Protestant and Orthodox leaders will join the pope for ecumenical worship , local fund raiser Joe Griffith declares : " This Holy Father is the easiest sell I ever had " ? despite the fact that the president of the Southern Baptist Convention , Dr. Adrian Rogers , has declined the pope 's invitation to prayer " for reasons that are best not expressed in the public media . " American Jews are more mixed in their response . In San Francisco , Mayor Dianne Feinstein and her husband hosted a $250-a-plate dinner at their home for the papal trip . But Jewish businessman Melvin Swig , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pope 's June reception at the Vatican for Austrian President Kurt Waldheim . Elsewhere , Jewish leaders say they will not decide whether to meet with the pope until after Sept. 1 , when John Paul II has scheduled an unprecedented 90-minute dialogue on Israel , the Holocaust and Catholic antiSemitism with Jewish representatives . Inevitably , the papal party will be greeted at almost every stop by demonstrators . Women 's rights groups , homosexuals and pro-choice abortion advocates expect to air grievances against the pope . But if the pope is going to be embarrassed , the culprits are more likely to be the local organizers than any group of protesters . One problem is simply logistical : his outsize outdoor masses are scheduled to last at least three hours , but most participants will have enormous difficulty getting to and from the sites . Worse yet , planners of the pope 's midmorning mass in Monterey recommend that all cars arrive at park-andride locations no later than 4 a.m. and warn that stragglers will not get home much before midnight . Health officials in the South are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some worshipers . In San Antonio , the top health official resigned her post when local church and city officials refused to heed her warning that Texas heat , crowding and lack of water would produce fatalities . In New Orleans , officials fear that if the day proves to be a scorcher , heat victims will overwhelm the proposed 10-bed hospital tent . Nonetheless , Archbishop Philip Hannan is fighting city efforts to limit the pope 's crowd to 277,000 . Clearly , American church officials are eager to gratify the pope 's desire to reach out to ordinary people . And they are no doubt counting on the 67-year-old pontiff 's legendary stamina to carry him through this grueling trip . But their ambitious plans , may well have underestimated the needs of his devoted flock . Unlike Jesus , who was able to sustain the crowds that followed him by multiplying loaves and fishes , the pope can not control the weather or traffic jams .
