The long-awaited indictments would open a new , public chapter in the biggest scandal of the Reagan administration . The charges , however , are not expected to contain any ' ' bombshells ' ' that would greatly damage the President or even the vice-president , according to those familiar with the investigation. // The indictments would follow on the heels of the guilty plea of Robert McFarlane , the first person to admit criminal conduct in the Iran-contra affair while a member of the Reagan administration. // // Mr. McFarlane served as the President ' s national-security adviser when the arms sales to Iran were initiated . He was also instrumental in funneling secret aid to the Nicaraguan contras at a time when such aid was prohibited by Congress in the Boland amendment . On Friday , he pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor charges that he withheld information from Congress , and faces a maximum penalty of four years in prison and a fine of $400 , 000. // McFarlane ' s plea is only a sideshow to the broad conspiracy case that Lawrence Walsh , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one source , Mr. Walsh is expected to indict Rear Adm . John Poindexter , who was McFarlane ' s deputy and succeeded him as national-security adviser ; Lt. Col. Oliver North , who headed the arms-sales network ; and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord , who was also involved in the network . It is unclear whether the fourth person will be Albert Hakim , who was General Secord ' s business partner , or Tom Clines , who bought weapons that were later sold to the contras. // McFarlane ' s plea bargain , in which he admitted to relatively minor offenses rather than face possible indictment on more serious crimes such as obstruction of justice , is not expected to unearth much new information . ' ' McFarlane has been cooperating with Walsh already , ' ' notes one source familiar with the investigation . ' ' I would be surprised if there ' s a bombshell in the testimony he is giving to Walsh as opposed to what he gave ' ' to congressional investigators , he says. // Unlike other targets of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secord , and Mr. Hakim , McFarlane testified before Congress without a grant of limited immunity from prosecution . Thus , Walsh ' s investigators have been able to use his congressional testimony all along without the risk of ' ' tainting ' ' or jeopardizing their case . He has also appeared several times without immunity before the grand jury convened to hear evidence gathered by Walsh. // On the courthouse steps after he met with the judge presiding over the case , McFarlane said , ' ' I ' ve told all that I know , and it ' s on the public record for everyone to see . ' ' Walsh , too , denied that McFarlane ' s grand jury testimony was a ' ' breakthrough. ' ' // In and of itself , the damage created by McFarlane ' s plea bargain to others in the administration is more symbolic than substantive , says one lawyer . ' ' The mere fact that he pled guilty to criminal conduct does not in any way bring it closer to the President or the vice-president , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rests not in the information he can provide , but in the role he will play in tying the conspiracy case together , one legal source says . Walsh hinted at that when he said that McFarlane ' s testimony ' ' relieves us of certain difficult joinder matters . ' ' In other words , it will help Walsh join several defendants together in multiple charges - that is , the conspiracy case. // Furthermore , McFarlane will make Walsh ' s life much easier in front of a trial jury . ' ' If you ' re investigating conspiracy , it ' s always useful to get one of the co-conspirators to participate in the prosecution , ' ' notes one legal expert . Without such cooperation , says a prosecutor involved in the investigation , the case would have to be presented to the jury ' ' piece by piece , ' ' relying heavily on documents . ' ' If you can have a witness who gives them a narrative , it helps to make it coherent for the jury , ' ' he says. // There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for months . Ever since the scandal became public in November 1986 , he has appeared more tormented than others about his role and the cloud cast over the Reagan administration . In February 1987 , he attempted suicide. // Although the plea bargain saves McFarlane the ordeal of a public prosecution , there are no guarantees that he will be saved a stint in prison . Walsh would not say Friday whether he would recommend leniency when McFarlane is sentenced. // Specifically , McFarlane admitted to withholding information in three letters to House committees ( on Sept. 5 , Sept. 12 , and Oct. 7 , 1985 ) in which he denied knowledge of money being raised for the contras . On the fourth count , he admitted to making false statements in testimony Dec. 8 , 1986 before the House Foreign Affairs Committee , when he said he had no ' ' concrete ' ' knowledge that a foreign country ( Saudi Arabia ) had given money to the contras. // The McFarlane plea signals the imminent end of a 15-month investigation studded with obstacles for the government prosecutors. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from congressional testimony last summer by immunized witnesses , which basically meant a news blackout for many on Walsh ' s staff . They have tried - not entirely successfully , it is believed - to fill gaps in information created by the shredding machine and memory lapses of testifiers. // They had to fight pitched battles for documents with attorneys for North and other targets . They were also forced to wait until November to obtain financial records from Switzerland - a cornerstone to the case. // And the biggest hurdle looms ahead . If the Supreme Court later this spring agrees that the law authorizing independent counsels is unconstitutional , the evidence arising from the first three months of the investigation could be thrown out. // //
