A year ago , the star of James A. ( for Addison ) Baker III was at its zenith . Standing at Ronald Reagan 's side in Tokyo , the 67th U.S. Treasury Secretary helped forge an agreement at the annual summit meeting for improved international economic cooperation . While Baker was accomplishing that feat , his aides in Washington were midwifing a tax bill in the U.S. Senate that became the basis for the most dramatic tax reform in more than 30 years . <P> Now the low-key , University of Texas-educated lawyer is facing some of his greatest challenges since he became Treasury Secretary in 1985 . Baker , 57 , is seeing many of his initiatives  --  on worldwide economic growth , Third World debt and the alignment of currencies  --  stymied . As a result , his aura of achievement has lost some of its luster . Says Byron Wien , chief domestic- portfolio strategist at the Morgan Stanley investment firm : " The initial enthusiasm for Baker and his initiatives has dissipated . We all hope he 'll get his second wind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation as the Administration 's Great Persuader , earned during four successful years as White House chief of staff . He carried on in the same vein , altering the confrontational tone of his predecessor ( and successor as chief of staff ) Donald Regan . On Third World debt issues , for example , Regan had preached the hard-nosed gospel of austerity for debtor nations . Baker soon changed that with his celebrated proposal for debt relief through renewed economic growth , to be fueled in part by some $20 billion in additional loans from commercial banks . <P> Regan had long ignored allies ' complaints about the U.S. budget deficit and concerns at home about an overvalued U.S. dollar that had led to a dismal American trade deficit . Baker reversed that stance with the September 1985 Plaza accord , a five-nation cooperative attempt to hasten the dollar 's decline . Baker tried to use the dollar 's continuing fall as a diplomatic tool . His aim : to chivy West Germany and Japan into expanding their domestic economies , while counting on the U.S. currency 's drop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baker was disappointed in those efforts , largely because he commanded as little control over the behavior of U.S. allies as he wielded over the congressional budget process . As criticism of Baker mounted , some wondered whether he was a victim of his early success . Said Charles Schultze , a senior fellow at Washington 's Brookings Institution : " In the beginning he probably got far too much credit , and now he may be getting too much blame . " <P> Baker appeared to undergo another setback with last month 's decision of major U.S. banks , led by Citicorp , to write off sizable portions of their &lt; Third World loan portfolios . As a result of that move , many economics experts now think the so-called Baker Plan for developing economies is essentially dead . The Treasury Secretary , however , remains sanguine . He lauded Citicorp 's debt write-off , for example , as a " positive " step . One reason : the approach reduces the likelihood of wholesale default by debtor nations .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
