Soldiers make heavy going of their new look in fatigues <P> American servicemen do not expect to make the cover of Gentlemen 's Quarterly , but they do want their combat wear to be both practical and neat . The latest Army fatigues appear to be neither . The half-nylon , half-cotton outfit , with its amoebic pattern of green , brown , tan and black , is unacceptably hot , even in temperate climates . It was designed to be an " all-service , all-purpose " uniform , but clerks , mechanics and drill sergeants alike bemoan its uncomfortable cut and slovenly look . It was supposed to be the pride of the Pentagon , but the battle dress uniform ( B.D.U. ) has been rapidly unraveling as a dud . Or so suggests an internal Army cable . <P> After questioning soldiers from Bremerhaven to Grenada , combat command officers from Fort McPherson , Ga. , reported that the response to the current B.D.U. , introduced in 1981 , was " universally unfavorable . " That was putting it mildly . During last October 's Grenada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appropriate tropical gear complained that the fabric was heavy , sweaty and unkempt . Even soldiers in cooler climes agreed . Once wet , the uniform takes an excessive time to dry . The sleeves are too narrow to roll up easily , the collar too wide and the pants pockets hard to reach . Seams unravel , buttons fall off . The trousers come with a reinforced crotch that strengthens the garment but constricts its wearer . After a few washings , the fabric shrinks , its colors fading to a mottled purple . <P> A morale problem has been added to the practical difficulties : a chemical agent has been embedded in the fabric to protect troops from nighttime detection by enemy heat-seeking infrared devices . But this precludes the use of starch . " It hangs like a pair of pajamas , " moans Specialist Fourth Class Richard Russell of Fort Benning , Ga . Although new recruits are given their uniforms , enlisted men have to purchase them at a cost of $16.30 for the pants , $14.75 for the shirt and $31.13 for the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle-tested green cotton-and-poly-ester fatigues , which had been in service for 24 years . The Army has spent $205 million on 6.4 million sets and is pressing on with plans to buy 7 million more at a cost of $227 million . The Army plans to provide at least four sets to each of the more than 778,000 regular soldiers , both men and women , and to 670,000 National Guardsmen . The uniform will also be used by the other services . Nonetheless , alterations are planned . A new line will do away with the reinforced crotch and will place pants pockets lower . A lightweight tropical version will soon be introduced . <P> Some Army officials are willing to give the B.D.U. a chance . Said Brigadier General Jimmy Ross : " It 's a fine uniform , and it 's getting better with each innovation . " <P> Troop grumbling about uniforms is hardly new but often justified . World War I doughboys suffered puttees , tight leg wrappings that all but cut off circulation . Their helmets offered minimal protection .
