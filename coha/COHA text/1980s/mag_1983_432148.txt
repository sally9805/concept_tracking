 | Freed from the grip of recession , the economy is taking off on a climb that should extend to mid-1984 and beyond . How much beyond will depend on when the business community decides the climate is right to step up its investment in new equipment and factories . That decision , in turn , will be influenced by the level of interest rates , inflation and federal deficits , as well as by consumer appetites . For now , accelerated spending by consumers ? as well as by business executives restocking inventories ? is powering an upward thrust that is much stronger than had been expected just a few months ago . The U S.News &; World Report Economic Unit , which has been more optimistic than many forecasters , now looks for the economy to grow in the year ahead at its most rapid clip since 1977 . The nation 's total output of goods and services , after inflation , is expected to expand by 6.1 percent over the next 12 months . This compares with a growth rate of only 2.6 percent from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the civilian unemployment rate , at 10.1 percent in May , to 9 percent in June , 1984 . Inflation , as measured by the consumer price index , is predicted to run at only 4.2 percent over the year ? or just over a third of the average increase in prices during the 1979-81 years . Only a blip . The sharp jump in consumer prices reported for May , at a 6.7 percent annual rate , is viewed as an aberration that does not signal a new outbreak of inflation . One reason : President Reagan 's reappointment of Paul Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board assures that the fight against inflation will be waged with as much commitment in the future as it has been in the past few years . So certain is the Economic Unit over the inflation outlook that it predicts interest rates will resume their downward trend shortly and will continue to fall well into next year . For example , one key measure of short-term rates ? the yield on threemonth Treasury bills ? is expected to decline from its recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low of 7.4 percent . Similarly , the benchmark prime rate , which big banks charge their best customers , should drop from its current 10.5 percent level to 9 percent or less by early next year . In long-term borrowing , mortgage rates are predicted to ease from about 12.5 percent today to about 11 percent . Falling interest rates , coupled with the July 1 tax cut , will encourage consumers to spend even more freely , especially for autos , appliances , furniture and other big-ticket items . Add in a 9 percent gain in personal income after taxes , and consumers are expected to expand their spending by the same amount in the year ahead . That will help push auto production to more than 2 million units by AprilJune of 1984 , the highest for any second quarter in five years . New housing starts will reach a 1.75-million-unit an- nual rate in that same period , the best quarterly average since the third quarter of 1979 . But the decline in interest rates will not be enough to spark the surge in capital spending by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major expansion ? at least not before mid1984 . Manufacturing plants operated at only 72 percent of capacity in May . The rate is expected to rise to only 77 percent over the coming year , which wo n't be enough to power a capital-spending boom between now and then . Corporate profits , however , will climb by an estimated 29 percent in the year ahead ? the heftiest jump in seven years . That will provide the money for a capital spending upsurge later on when the economic climate is right . Dividend payments will increase by about 14 percent . Though the Economic Unit 's outlook may be brighter than those of some forecasters , the trend is clearly toward more optimism . The government bolstered that feeling when it said in a June 21 flash report that the gross national product rose at a 6.6 percent annual rate in the April-June period . If that estimate is correct , it would be the best single-quarter performance since the 7.9 percent growth recorded in the opening three months of 1981 . Even so , the preliminary report may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York believes the April-June result will be 7.5 percent or more when it is revised on the basis of later data . " The economy is rebounding strongly from the recession , " Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige told Congress . " The recovery not only has gained momentum , it has broadened as well . " The good news is convincing forecasters ? including those at the White House ? to raise their economic sights , especially for the next 18 months . Up a point ? When the administration gives its mid-July forecast for growth in 1983 , as measured from the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth quarter of this year , it is expected to add about 1 percentage point to the 4.7 percent rate it predicted in April . The White House also will boost its 4 percent growth projection for 1984 closer to 5 percent . Private forecasters already are busy upgrading their predictions . " Reaganomics is going to be successful in 1984 , " says Allen Sinai of Data Resources , Inc. , a forecasting firm in Lexington , Mass. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . " The economy " is a lot healthier now than it was six months ago , " agrees Donald Straszheim of Wharton Econometrics in Philadelphia , " and will be even healthier in six months than it is now . " So healthy , in fact , that William Shipman , a partner at the consulting firm of H. C. Wainwright &; Company in Boston , says that " our best guess is that we are entering our best two years since the Korean War period . " Most forecasters agree that the big federal deficits loom as the major obstacle to a sustained expansion . But the recovery has gained so much strength recently that Lawrence Chianerine of Chase Econometrics in Bala-Cynwyd , Pa. , says " the question period " posed by the red ink has now been put off until late 1984 or 1985 . Until the deficit issue is resolved , explains Alan Greenspan , a Reagan adviser and president of Townsend-Greenspan , Inc. , in New York , relatively high interest rates will continue to inhibit capital-goods spending and thus will keep the recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminate the interestrate problem , which requires eliminating the deficit problem , " observes Albert Sommers of the Conference Board , a business-research organization in New York , " then this could become the strongest recovery in the postwar period . " Despite all the positive signs , however , the fact remains that so far the econ- omy 's pace still hangs below that of the average first year of the seven recoveries since the end of World War II . Many economists say the recession bottomed out last December . Measuring from the fourth quarter of 1982 to the fourth quarter of 1983 , the magazine 's Economic Unit predicts economic growth at 5.7 percent ? compared with an average gain of 6.9 percent for the first year of previous recoveries . Thus , few experts look for a runaway boom soon . Martin Feldstein , the President 's chief economic adviser , told USN &; WR that , as encouraged as he is by recent events , he still feels there 's a 1-in-3 chance that the recovery could lose steam next year . The USN &; WR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees the recovery developing in the year ahead Summer : Continued buying by both consumers and businesses should maintain growth in the third quarter at close to the April-June pace . When the final figures are in , the economy 's surge in the six months from April through September is likely to be the best two-quarter rate in six years . Industrial production , which has been rising since last November , should continue to expand steadily . This will boost employment above 100 million , after hanging below that level during the recession , and push unemployment below 10 percent of the labor force for the first time in nearly a year . Autumn : Housing starts reach a 1.6 million-unit rate , and outlays for defense increase by about 5 percent from the previous quarter . Output of factories , mines and utilities grows by 3 percent , and joblessness slides to 9.6 percent by year-end . Winter : Now in its fifth quarter , the recovery will be a bit stronger in the opening months of 1984 than it was before Christmas . Fueling the thrust will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been depleted by the consumer spending spree . Production by industry finally surpasses its prerecession peak of 2 1/2 years ago . Business spending for new plant and equipment begins to pick up . Spring : Total output continues to gain momentum , assuring that the recovery will last through the presidential election in November . Rising business investment more than compensates for a slowdown in residential construction . In excess of 102 million people are at work at midyear 1984 , and the jobless rate drops to about 9 percent .
