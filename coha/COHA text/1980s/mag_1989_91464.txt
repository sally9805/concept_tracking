Gary Kasparov forever fidgets in his smartly cut tweeds , now drawing his knees up under his chin , now hunching over the chessboard . His opponent , known in chess circles as Deep Thought , betrays no emotion beyond the sickly blue pall that radiates from its squarish face . Deep Thought is not Linda Lovelace 's smarter sister but a computer program . And it was being short-circuited at the New York Academy of Art , an art school , in a watershed showdown between man and machine . Or , rather , Soviet world chess champ and machine . // Deep Thought is the reigning computer titleholder , having defeated all comers at the 1989 World Computer Chess Championship in Edmonton . Last fall the program beat a grand master for the first time , bending Bent Larsen of Denmark at a tournament in Long Beach , Calif . A few weeks ago it burned American grand master Robert Byrne . Deep Thought came into Sunday 's two-game match with a solid grand master 's rating of 2,551 , which was well behind Kasparov , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set by Bobby Fischer . " The challenge of computer science is to create an artificial intelligence that can beat the world champ , " said Hsu Fenghsiung , 30 , one of five Carnegie-Mellon graduate students who designed Deep Thought . " It 's our Holy Grail . " // Kasparov , who is 26 , said he was playing the 18-month-old program for the honor of all humanity ( plus a $10,000 fee ) . " I ca n't visualize living with the knowledge that a computer is stronger than the human mind , " he said . " I had to challenge Deep Thought to protect the human race . " And if he were to lose ? " No one would care about chess anymore . Human chess would become second class . " // The first chess-playing machine was a Viennese " automaton , " introduced in 1770 , that turned out to be a fraud , but electronic gizmos have been playing passable chess since the mid- ' 60s . Lately , though , they have made a knight 's leap in speed and sophistication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sifts through the almost infinite possibilities with a thoroughness and speed impossible for the human mind , scanning 720,000 moves a second . " Kasparov only looks at two or three moves , " said grand master Edmar Mednis . " He 's much more efficient . " Deep Thought 's big weakness is that it lacks tactical vision and , above all , common sense . " Chess is more than computation , " Kasparov said . " You need fantasy and intuition . " // Kasparov prepped for Sunday 's exhibition by studying 50 of Deep Thought 's best games . But the absence of a tangible opponent clearly bothered him . " It 's like playing a black hole , " he said . " Computers have no energy . Or fear . They fight until the very end and sometimes beyond . " // It was a long day for the hundred or so spectators who sat amid the faux Roman statuary flanking the protagonists at the Greenwich Village art school . They had to rely on a large display board for a glimpse of what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thought 's silence made you long for HAL , the computer of 2001 : A Space Odyssey , which had a voice like a Wimbledon umpire . HAL had " feelings " programmed into its circuits but lost its head and turned homicidal . Deep Thought has brains but no soul . " It 's just a bunch of wires , geometry and silicone , " said Hsu. // The match played itself out with a kind of classic inevitability . Deep Thought opened with a pawn to e4 . Kasparov countered with the Sicilian defense . Hsu sat by his baby , feeding it Kasparov 's moves and watching the ones being considered as they scrolled down the screen . Kasparov eschewed his usual aggressive attack for a slow , positional crush that made Deep Thought 's bookish game look positively primitive . Outthought and outmaneuvered , it hung on grimly . " To make Gary keep playing when all is hopeless is almost inhumane , " protested organizer Shelby Lyman . Finally , after 2 ? hours and 52 moves , Hsu conceded . The second game was even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fought off one threatened checkmate after another . This time its handlers surrendered after move 37. // " I think the computer needs to be taught one thing , " said Kasparov , his domination of chess and the future of humanity secure for now . // What 's that ? // " How to resign . "
