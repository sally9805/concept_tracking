DETROIT  --  The Big Three auto makers earned about $2. 4 billion in the second quarter , auto analysts estimate , down almost $1 billion , or 30% , from the year-earlier period . A higher tax rate this year accounts for most of the decline , but sales incentives such as low-cost financing hurt profits , analysts said . General Motors Corp. , the No. 1 maker , earned $3. 25 to $4 a common share in the quarter , analysts estimated , down from $1. 6 billion , or $5. 09 a share . Last year ' s net income included a one-time $422 million , or $1. 34 a share , tax credit , however , for GM ' s domestic international sales corporation . Discs provided companies with incentives to export products . Without the credit , GM last year would have earned about $3. 75 a share . Wendy Beale , an analyst with Smith Barney , Harris Upham &; Co. , pointed out that GM ' s tax rate last year , after the tax credit , was 21. 5% . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 44% for the quarter , and she expects that GM will report profit of $1. 2 billion , or $3. 75 a share , essentially indicating a flat year-to-year profit performance . GM ' s second-quarter car sales may have included more of the less expensive , less profitable models and may have left the factories loaded with fewer options , theorizes Scott Merlis of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc . He estimates GM ' s second-quarter net at $3. 70 a share . Ford Motor Co. earned $3. 50 to $4 a primary share in the quarter , analysts say , compared with $909. 1 million , or $4. 95 a primary share and $4. 68 a fully diluted share , a year earlier . " It ' s hard to say how the cost of incentives may have affected Ford , " said Ann Knight , an analyst for PaineWebber Inc . If Ford customers in the second period ordered enough options on their cars , the cost of the Ford incentives may have been blunted , she said . Otherwise , they will hurt the No. 2 maker ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million , or $3. 50 a fully diluted share . Mr. Merlis , too , believes that Ford ' s profit will be off in the second quarter  --  to $3. 70 a share primary and $3. 50 fully diluted . But he believes the main reasons are the stronger U.S. dollar ' s negative effect on overseas operations and the negative effects of currency fluctuations in Europe . During last year ' s second quarter , Chrysler Corp. still was flush with tax-loss carry-forwards from previous unprofitable quarters . These boosted Chrysler ' s net to $802. 9 million , or $6. 48 a share . The year-earlier period ' s profit before the tax benefit was $451. 3 million , or $3. 62 a share . Analysts estimate that Chrysler in the latest period earned $4. 25 to $5 a share , lower than year-earlier net but ahead of its performance before the tax benefits . " Chrysler is showing year-to-year gains for its minivan , " says Mr. Merlis , and has been helped by its H-cars , Chrysler LeBaron GTS and Dodge Lancer . But he estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate on its earnings , compared with almost no taxes a year earlier . Mr. Merlis is calling for second-quarter earnings of $533 million , or $4. 50 a share . The Big Three auto makers don ' t disclose details of results before their official reportings , which they will make the last week of this month .
