The hour approaches midnight on the campus of Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh , but in Wean Hall , C.M.U. 's computer center , it might as well be high noon . On the fifth floor , two dozen undergraduates pound computer terminal keyboards , complete class assignments or work on research projects . In a glass-walled room two floors below , 20 students are seated at terminals . Down the hall from them , in a large room known as the SPICE rack ( for a project called the Scientific Personal Interactive Computing Environment ) , several young men and women tap away on Wean Hall 's most sophisticated machines . <P> Welcome to the world of the computer hacker . As midnight wears on to 3 a.m. and then 6 a.m. , the hum of conversation dies and Wean Hall becomes very quiet . But the lights burn on , the soft-drink machine on the third floor continues to dispense 16-oz. bottles , and nocturnal computerniks still sprawl before green screens , clack-clacking their instructions into the memory of a DEC-20 system . <P> Rob MacLachlan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blue headband to keep his flowing blond hair at bay . He is barefoot . On this night he is running through the SPICE program on a $70,000 Symbolics LM2 computer . The project 's goal : to provide a network ( a group of interconnected computers ) with almost unlimited memory and computation power . He also uses the terminal to play games-Star Wars , Splines and Worm-devised by students and faculty members at C.M.U. and other schools . <P> " I 'm a hacker ; it would be silly for me to deny it , " MacLachlan says . " My grade-point average is higher or lower depending on how many computer courses I take in a semester . I 'm really not that interested in other subjects . " MacLachlan 's longest stretch in front of a terminal so far this year : 32 hours . <P> As a hacker , MacLachlan is a member of an intense , reclusive subculture of the computer age that has cropped up at the nation 's top universities . The term hacker derives from " hack , " meaning a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer program . Hackers spend hours typing commands on terminal keyboards to learn as much as possible about the strengths and weaknesses of a particular program or network . They tinker for the sheer fun of it , delving deeper and deeper into the mysteries of software . <P> Indeed , a good deal of pop psychology has been written about the tendency of hackers to sublimate personal or academic problems in the immediate thrill of answering a question posed on a terminal screen . In Psychology Today , Stanford Professor Philip Zimbardo summed up the hacker 's dilemma : " Fascination with the computer becomes an addiction , and as with most addictions , the ' substance ' that gets abused is human relationships . " <P> The hacker stereotype is a pudgy male with a fish-belly-white complexion who swills soft drinks , lives on candy bars and spends most of his waking hours in front of a terminal , playing games or trying to penetrate Defense Department networks . ( So far as is known , no one has succeeded in breaching a classified Pentagon system . ) Dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeans and tie-dyed couture of the Woodstock generation . Beards and glasses are popular hacker accessories .
