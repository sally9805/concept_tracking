The possibility of a recession , which at various times in the last year has seemed just over the horizon , has receded and is no longer regarded as an apparent threat. // One important reason is the roaring bull market in stocks and bonds . By making investors richer , it has raised both confidence and the outlook for consumer spending , which accounts for two-thirds of the economy. // // ' Rather Sluggish Fashion ' // " The prospects for the economy in 1986 are quite good , " said A. Gilbert Heebner , chief economist for the Philadelphia National Bank , in a prediction that typifies current professional thinking . " It ' s going to seem like more of the same , with the economy growing but in a rather sluggish fashion. " // The Reagan Administration , for its part , is believed to have tentatively adopted a 4 percent growth forecast for next year , somewhat higher than that of most private analysts. // To be sure , few economists or politicians are satisfied with the current rate of American growth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent in 1984 . This year ' s rate has been barely enough to keep unemployment from rising and it has left industry with large amounts of idle productive capacity. // Moreover , agriculture and parts of the oil , real estate and banking industries are in disarray despite an expansion that this month reached its third anniversary . Weak farm and crude oil prices , as well as a glut of unrented office space in some cities , could cause more problems for banks in 1986. // Yet most economists predict solid growth for 1986 . They cite several factors for this tempered optimism . Both interest rates and the dollar ' s value are down , the Federal Reserve has already produced rapid expansion of the money supply and oil prices seem headed still lower , which is a boon to users. // Corporate plans to raise capital spending by only a negligible amount are likely to be offset by a fresh impetus in consumer spending that until recently had seemed to be leveling off. // " Our members have pushed their 1986 growth forecasts successively higher over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of the National Association of Business Economists. // A 300-member sample of this group expects the gross national product , the nation ' s total output of goods and services , to rise next year by 2. 9 percent after allowing for inflation . This compares with the 3. 1 percent advance projected by the 50 economists regularly surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators , an Arizona-based forecasting organization that also tabulates the predictions of others. // A year ago the Blue Chip economists also predicted 3. 1 percent growth . G.N.P. growth for 1985 is running at a rate of 2. 4 percent . The business economists had predicted a 1985 rate of 3. 3 percent. // Although economic forecasting is an inexact art that is partly in disrepute because its practitioners must make assumptions about the actions of politicians , many regard the performance of the 1986 economy as more preordained than usual . <> <> Agreement on Inflation // There is , for example , general agreement that inflation will not rise significantly before 1987 . " We feel pretty comfortable about it remaining in check , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security Pacific National Bank who expresses the consensus view about the coming year. // The Blue Chip forecasters envision the Consumer Price Index rising by 3. 7 percent , barely higher than the 3. 6 percent increase that has prevailed for the last 12 months . Last year ' s prediction for 1985 was for inflation of 4. 5 percent. // A perhaps under-appreciated factor in the outlook , but one attracting increased attention , is the momentum imparted by the soaring securities markets . Although stock and bond prices generally tend to reflect expectations of business conditions , major swings in prices can also become an active force for expansion or contraction of the economy. // " Gains in securities prices , " said the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company ' s latest economic survey , " have boosted the wealth of households , a plus for consumer spending , as well as lowered the cost of financial capital , a plus for investment. " // According to Lawrence A. Kudlow , president of Rodman &; Renshaw Economics Inc. and a former Reagan Administration economist , the markets have added as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the last 18 months , an amount equal to three months of the G.N.P. // " To be sure , not everyone in the economy owns stocks and bonds , " he said . " But the central point is that the economic activists , the entrepreneurs and risk-takers , drive the economy through investment and employment actions . These decisions to spend on new equipment , new structures , new technologies , as well as new employment , are the crucial steps necessary to reinvigorate or revitalize an economy. " // Statistics showing high consumer debt and low savings , many analysts say , should therefore be seen as an overly gloomy assessment of the likely inclination and ability of consumers to spend next year . Most economists , moreover , think the economy will become progressively better balanced in 1986 . A further decline in the dollar , which is widely expected , would induce foreigners to purchase more United States goods while curbing the American appetite for imports . On both counts , this implies a modest recovery in the lagging manufacturing sector. // This would also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consensus thinks will continue to hover around 7 percent. // Some analysts maintain that tax legislation along the lines approved this month by the House of Representatives could hurt the economy by discouraging investment . While the effective date for such tax law changes may be pushed off into 1987 , if Senate debate on a tax bill creates uncertainty in the business community , an effect could be felt in 1986. // The prospect of shrinking Federal budget deficits under the new deficit-reduction act could be a force for economic contraction for 1986 and the next several years . However , reduced Federal borrowing to finance deficits tends to stimulate the economy by lowering interest rates. //
