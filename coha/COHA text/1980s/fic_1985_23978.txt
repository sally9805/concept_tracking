THE FOOT By Michelle Huneven ooner or later , everyone finds out . Five years ago , when I was twenty-three years old , I shcit my boyfriend in the foot . And was arrested and punished . It would seem at times that the shooting is the most interesting thing about me . Most people have never shot anybody . By the end of every party I go to , all the people I do n't know are surreptitiously observing me . I 'm not secretive about the crime , although until now I 've never employed a confeSsion as my opening line . Felonies thrive in the public domain , so most people do n't have to get the story from me . My friends and even my family happily supply the details . I 've gotten so I can spot it when somebody knows . They treat me deferentially . For example , if the subject of violence or , say , gun control arises , they 'll attempt to steer the conversation back to gentler topics . I 'm not fooled . Such honed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can trust them , can tell them the entire story . When I do indulge the curious , I 'm invariably surprised by their willingness to absolve me .

" Or this : " You must have been under a lot of pressure at school . " Oh , I realize that the impulse to ignore any evil intent on my part is a friendly impulse , but such goodwill serves only to underscore the fact that extenuating circumstances merely mitigate punishment and do not erase guilt .

I 'm a printmaker . Intaglio . I moved to the Midwest to study with a famous master printmaker . On my third day in town , I met Jon Doppinger while apartment hunting in the rustic decrepitude of Krantz 's Kottage Kourt . There were three vacant cottages , all scarcely larger than playhouses . Doppinger and I revolved around and around each other like the figurines on a cuckoo clock . I could n't help but notice him : he was seven-eighths leg , . and tall . So tall that he cracked his head on a lintel as we both left cottage number four . In sympathy , I covered my mouth with my hand . He shook his head . " Not my day , " he said . " It started out punk and it 's getting worse . " His eyes were shiny blue candies . I smiled and he kept on talking . " I repair TVs , " he said . " Today , one just popped out of my arms .

" Doppinger rubbed his head . His hair was tufty and blond . Really , he was very good-looking in an oddly proportioned way . He rented number eleven . I rented four . I moved in but he never did . I saw him again when he came to get his deposit back from Mr. Krantz . He knocked at my door and I asked him in for coffee . When he sat at my table , he looked perfectly normal . There was no clue that his legs were curled like hanks of rope under the tabletop . His face was rubbery and expressive . He gazed at me as if my next words might complete an enormous puzzle . It was flattering , but nerve-racking . I asked questions in self-defense . For example : Why was n't he moving in ? STORY 59 " My wife and I are splitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted the house . This week , I get it . " " What do you want ? " I asked . " Out , " he said . He did n't look happy . He went on to explain that it was his grandmother 's house in Breezy , some twenty-five miles away . He really did n't own it yet . " Besides , " he said , " my wife wants to go to school , and it 's easier for her if she lives in town . " " You have n't been to college ? " I asked . He laughed . His cheeks looked like halved rubber balls had been implanted under the skin . " Ph.D. , American Studies . My thesis was on the Knights of Labor , the first union . Ever need a sedative ? You can check it out of the university library . " He came back a few days later carrying a six-pack and an old Philco , which he gave to me .

Her husband came to see her and was rude to the doctor . The doctor left and was rude ro a nurse . The nurse wept and told the doctor she was carrying his child . Back in the hospital room , the husband gave his wife a bracelet . She dropped it on the floor , and when her husband bent to pick it up , she made a nasty face . Doppinger turned off the TV . " Ugh , " he said . His face was a knot . " Grab the beer , " he said , " and I 'll take you to a polka palace in Cedar Rapids . " We drove thirty miles and danced one polka on a beer-slick barroom finer . I had n't polkaed since the eighth grade , and I fought for balance as Doppinger twirled me around . It was like trying to dance with a scissors , or with a man cleft nearly in two . The music stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take you home and put you in cement shoes so you ca n't ever get away from me , " he said . Only we did n't go to his house . We drove north instead , and spent our first night together in an old hunting lodge a block from the Mississippi . The mattress sucked us down into a deep softness . 1 fit entirely within the arc of his body . It had been almost a year since I had slept with anyone , and his pulse , the hiss of his breath , and the thought of those infinite legs kept me awake , energized me as if 1 were lying with a radioactive statue , a Giacometti . In the morning he dropped me off at Krantz 's . Distracted , he did n't even turn off the car . " I have pickups and deliveries to make , " he said . " I have some jobs I should 've finished last night . " I poked him around the floating rib . No response . I wondered about those cement shoes . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " 1 have a houseplant dying of thirst . " Idid n't see him again for almost three until there 's nothing left of it , " he said . I sat on my single bed in Krantz 's Kottage Knott and contemplated the wound in the copper . It meshed with nothing I thought of . I thought of the pale sculpted cup of Doppinger 's pelvis and the inestimable distance to his toes . I opened the door one evening . " Dove and partridge season opens tomorrow . " Doppinger 's face was crosshatched by the screen between us . " Interested ? " Until that moment , I 'd thought of hunters as bullies and vandals . " Interested ? " he repeated . I nodded , let him in , and packed an overnight bag . His house was an elaborate pink Victorian encrusted with dark rose and green gingerbread . Among the neighboring white clapboards , it stuck out like a beribboned negligee on a wash line of diapers . Doppinger held the door open for me . The kitchen was a dim room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very primitive . The counter , however , was lined with electrical appliances . One could see the archaeology of women  --  generations , one on top of the other . " Pardon the mess , " said Doppinger . " She 's still moving rhings out . " 1 noticed then that the floor was cluttered with half-filled boxes . We both looked into the box at our feet . There was no order to it : a couple of historical-romance novels , some home-canned tomatoes . The handwriting on the Mason jar labels was flowery and girlish and in perfect keeping with the mawkish portraits on the novels ' covers . " Come on , " said Doppinger . " Come see the good stuff . " The living room was dim , too . Heavy curtains , dark old flowered things . Half a dozen disemboweled TVs sat on newspapers on the carpet . Doppinger introduced them to me by their problems : Unstable Picture , Vertical Jitters , No Video Information . He kicked boxes violently from his path to show me his uncle 's comic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose to a sepia photograph : a row of Doppinger 's ancestors standing in front of the lacy house . They were fair and socket-checked , and 1 could trace the source of Doppinger 's shocks blond hair and Slavic eyes . They scowled , a straight line of them , some with their arms linked as if to challenge any intruder into their home . We slept upstairs in the guest bedroom , away from the haunted marriage bed . He held me by the upper arms . Waist to head , we almost matched . His muscles were a fine system of ropes and pulleys . But we had trouble . 1 was computing boxes , the three weeks of silence , the prospect of hunting , possibly killing things , looked down the barrel of a four-ten as I over the spine of a tiny black wave . I sighted the blank face of Vertical Jitters . Doppinger came up and pushed the barrel down . " Never never never , " he said , " never aim in the house . " We hunted all morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strangely perpendicular pursuit . I had a hard time keeping up with his seven-league legs . He stalked on , alert , feral , camouflaged in old brown clothes except for the red button of his hat . His fractious setter ran about us in hysterical glee , then raced far ahead , too far . " Dimby , dammit , Dimby , " Doppinger shouted . He waited for me . " And you , " he said . " You stop swinging your gun . " My wrist went rigid . He pointed to the dog 's tail , a wispy red flag . " If she keeps this up , I 'm going to have to shoot her . " " You 're what ? " Doppinger chucked me under the chin . " At this distance , it 'll only frighten her and irritate her a little . And teach her not to run so goddamned far ahead . " I 'd had no idea that guns had such a range of expression . A bush loosed a flurry of doves , and Doppinger shot so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground . Tears popped from my eyes . Doppinger walked up to the birds and with a dainty twist of his toe mashed skulls and beaks into black soil . Ile lifted them by their feet and offered them to me , a gray bouquet . It was n't as had as I 'd expected . They were tiny birds , virtually weightless . The next time he shot , I did not cry out . 1 was no longer ignorant . Compared with the doves , I had superior procedural knowledge . As we broke down the guns at the car , Doppinger suggested I shoot one round . He handed me his double-barreled twelve gauge . I discharged both barrels into a naked blue sky . The butt skidded cruelly against my collarbone . The blast burned away all other sound . I blushed a lava flow and understood why men liked guns . Now , I too liked guns . Doppinger kept to a tight schedule . TVs In the meantime , he had more work coming in than he could finish promptly . We could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend more , nu , all of my time with him . I could n't help it , I just did . He made me laugh even when I was furious with him for neglecting me . I had to adjust to his humor , which was boyish and a little on the grisly side . Once , he chased me around the house with a dead mouse . The mouse 's tail , stiff from rigor mortis , stuck out straight , and Doppinger wielded it like a sword . " I 'll run you through , " he shouted as I dodged him . Doppinger always laughed ar his own pranks . His tomcat came home after a weeklong ramble with a huge abscess on his neck . When the abscess drained , we saw windpipe . The next time we ate spaghetti , Doppingcr held a fat forkful to his Adam 's apple . " Who does this remind you of ? " he asked , and laughed with a quiet , funny catch in his voice , almost a sob . if I pushed for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't I have enough things to feel badly about ? " he 'd say . To kill the blocks of days alone , I did what I had done for years . worked in the print studio . I hovered helplessly over the scarred copper plate until my teacher , disgusted , ordered me to put it aside . He gave me a number-six pencil . Its line was hairlike . ' Draw ! Rupture space ! " he yelled . I drew televisions . Televisions in formation , televisions leaking images , exploded diagrams of televisions . My teacher growled over my shoulder . He was famous for tearing up student work . He made fun of my obsession , but my work remained intact . I drew on . Televisions were n't exactly the point , but they were as close as I could come . I did n't meet Doppinger 's wife until the shooting , but the house yielded an afterimage of her as if she 'd just vanished . The curtains , the magnetic butterflies on the refrigerator door , the houseplants fading for want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , she left an awful lot behind . Her registry china in the oak buffet . Her wedding dress in plastic in the closet , preserved , then abandoned . Doppinger never talked about it . In fact , when Patsy Cline sang " Why why why did you say goodbye ? " he turned off the radio . When there was a marriage counselor on Good Morning America , he turned off the TV . You get first shot , " said Doppinger . This a small airborne electric motor . I fired . The bird dipped in flight , defecated , and flew on . " I 've hurt it , " I said . " Not enough , " said Doppinger . Minutes later , he got a long shot . Two hundred feet or so . His bird fell . I reached it first and was shocked by its beauty . The feathers shimmered prismatically : pale blue , emerald , rust , white , scarlet . The stipplings and lines were as intricate as the detail on a Chinese vase . What could such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be strutting in Byzantium . " It 's just so gorgeous , " I said . Doppinger smiled , nodded , and lifted the bird by its scaly yellow feet . " What a shame to kill it . " Doppinger considered this . " You have to admit , " he said , " it was one hell of a shot . " I thought of his motor response , the speed with which he sighted , followed , and struck . " Yes , " I said , but I remained confused until I figured out that I was feeling the way one was supposed to feel . Apparently , people hunt in order to open themselves up to complex , contradictory emotions . They hunt for the joy of the kill , but also for the shame of it . Birds of empyrean beauty were imported to this prairie , set free , and killed . It was a situation designed for both the appreciation and the wanton destruction of beauty . I was n't entirely won over to hunting , but it began to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the car and drank whiskeyed coffee . " Do n't feel badly about your bird , " Doppinger said . " It was a damn good try . It 's almost impossible to bring a bird down with a four-ten . You need a twenty gauge , more power , not too heavy . Let 's keep our eyes open for one . " VN e could n't spend Thanksgiving together . pulled in this morning . They 're ' in the backyard sighting their guns by blowing up Hubbard squashes . You can probably hear the shots . " 1 listened and then I hung up . That afternoon , while doing my laundry at Suds City , I began to relent . I already missed Doppinger . I found myself searching for his card on the bulletin board . There it was : EXPERT TELEVISION REPAIR . A reality check : I felt better just looking at it . Nearby , a scrap of paper caught my eye : 20-Gauge Shotgun Box of Shells Cleaning Kit Take it off my hands for $20 1 had an idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a pay phone . A woman answered . " Yes , " she said . " 1 " ye got the gun . " We agreed to meet at six-thirty at the feminist bookstore . I arrived early and stood but on the sidewalk . The temperature was dropping fast . It was freshly dark and the sky had that slight phosphorescence that comes with a major temperature change . My plan was simple . I would use the gun as an excuse to drop by Doppinger 's house . I would say I bought it in Cedar Rapids and that I 'd stopped by on the way home to have hint take a look at it . He 'd he pleased , I knew . So pleased , he might invite me to stay on and hunt with them in the morning . The Milky Way prickled out overhead . Chilled , I stepped inside . A tat woman sat reading behind the register . She glanced up at me and returned immediately to her book : Mole Power  --  How to Get It , How to Use It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her hair was shaved in a butCh cut and glistening with grease . She greeted the fat woman , then shook my hand . The gun wa 's encased in two brown socks , a misshapen sock nionkey . " It 's brand-new , " she said . " I bought it when I lived in Hyde Park and wanted some protection . I did n't want a registered gun , and some crank in a K-Mart convinced me that this would be my best bet . I 've never used it . I 've since been told that as an antipersonnel weap , : on , it stinks . It 's only a single shot , you see . Yob miss with the first shot and your rapist is ten times madder than before . Also , it 's only a twenty gauge . Might slow down a rat , but it wo n't do much damage to a man awash in testosterone . " She unSheathed the shotgun and handed it to me . " What are you going to use it for ? " " I hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yeah , well , you 'll like it then . " " Any trick to loading it ? " " Here . " She took the gun , broke it down , pulled a cartridge from the box , and pushed it that the nose was buried in the busy flowers of the upholstery . I lifted the gun and looked about for a better place . Jon Doppinger stood at the bedroom door . He was ten , twelve feet away . He wore a dark green robe , which was absurdly short and made his legs look extra long and pink , as if skinned . I looked right into his eyes , two dull dimes spinning to focus . His face was skullish . He raised one hand slowly , then let it drop . I waited to hear him speak . After maybe fifteen seconds , I remembered that I held a gun . I blinked in surprise . Yes , it was as if he knew what I was going to do before the idea even occurred to me . And in his certainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't know what to do next . I was onstage without my lines . if had to shoot him , I thought , 1 certainly did n't want to shoot him in the face , the chest , the stomach , the groin ... And then , like a voice-over in a movie , a sentence came to me : She shot him in the foot because she found him in bed with his wife . It was like some kind of joke . I fired . Before his blood rallied , I saw the foot : it looked like a computer card with a spate of clean , squarish holes . The woman screamed . Piano music tinkled . Doppinger jerked into motion , clawed for balance along the wainscoting . Close , he swung in arcs , a furious great ape . I threw down the gun . He came on . His hand found my shoulder . I absorbed the weight of his body 's swing . He went on by . Like a dog hit by a car , he was running to outstrip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child 's terrified , chordal screams , violent seizures of the voice box . I went to the bedroom . She had her pants on and was clutching an orange sweater to her chest and trying to burrow into the mattress . I dug my fingers into her black curls and pulled . Her mouth was a loud red hole . " Stop it , " I said . " You 've got to stop it . It 's just his foot . He 's all right . " She closed her eyes , screamed . " Goddamn it , " I said . " I 'm not going to shoot you . " I must have reassured her . Abruptly , she shut up . I ran out to the porch . Doppinger was on the lawn , convulsive , a cartoon character trying to pull himself free from a puddle of glue . The setter was barking and feinting coyly at him . I tried to get closer , but the dog turned on me and snarled . I retreated to the house , to the bedroom where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , pulled the sleeves right side out . " You 've got to get that dog away from him , " I said . The phone by the bed began to ring . " Forget it , " I said . I bunched up each sleeve . Obediently , she pushed her hands through . " Up , " I said , and she raised her arms above her head . Like Doppinger , she was wildly tall . Her breasts swayed in front of me , the nipples crinkled cookies . I yanked the sweater down , and once it sat snugly at her waist , her helplessness vanished . She shoved me aside and answered the phone . " Yes , " she said . " Jon 's been shot . " I knew I had to get out . The bedroom adjoined a sleeping porch , which had a door to the backyard . I ran around the house and got into my car from the passenger side . In moments I was out on the highway , heading home . Iarrived back at Krantz 's Kottage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be arrested . I had no clear idea of what I had done . I was n't worried about Doppinger . I was finished with him . No more to say . I worried for myself . When I tried to remember my past , my former habits , the people I loved , it all seemed to belong to another person . I bit my hand , trying through muscular contraction and localized pain to offset a rising terror . I got some hope from recalling the woman who sold me the gun . According to her , Doppinger had a load of rat shot in his foot . Maybe twelve little BBs , which , when I thought about it , were paltry retribution for three months of lies : it measured out to one BB a week . But I could n't hang on to anger . Like acid , guilt ate it away . I felt wronged but knew it was possible that I 'd done a greater wrong . Remorse and outrage were inexhaustible dance partners in my head . Intermittently , I resolved to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been filed ? I could n't just walk in and demand a jail cell . No , I had to wait and see what my life had become . The knock at my door came just as the sky was turning gray . A heavyset man , not in uniform , pronounced my name . Instantly , I understood that a great many people I 'd never heard of would be materializing and assuming places in my life . The firing of the gun had created a hole , a vortex that sucked me into a new , strange realm . I unlatched the screen door and let him in . He wore a DeKalb hat . His hands and cheeks were chapped and pink from the cold . He looked around , I think , for a source of warmth . Finding none , he turned to me. hate to have to do this , " he said , and read me my rights . In the patrol car , he told me Doppinger had been in surgery all night . " His foot was mush , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indictment are numerous and unappetizing . I quit school and gave myself wholly to the endless coils of the legal system . My crime replayed itself nonstop behind my eyes . My state-appointed lawyer , a twenty-six-year-old woman fresh out of law school , had high hopes of setting some kind of feminist precedent with the case . I never understood quire what she had in mind , but I had enormous difficulty convincing her that I had not bought the gun in a bath of victimized passion to wreak revenge on my wayward lover . When I repeated my modest story and derailed the desire to impress Doppinger with my purchase , she shook her head and said , " Wo n't do . " At one point , I was desperate to talk to Doppinger , just to verify that he existed and that I had shot him . He answered the phone , said , " I have nothing to say to you , " and hung up . I guess I got what I wanted . In a deposition , he volunteered his reasons for pressing charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he believed that anyone who shot at another person required formal punishment . The fact that he had taught me how to shoot only exacerbated his fury at my gross breach of gun etiquette . Also , I 'd trespassed , interfered . Right in the transcripts he said , " A man has every right in the world to sleep with his own wife in his own house without getting shot . " In the end , I pleaded guilty to " assault with a deadly weapon " and listed some extenuating circumstances . Doppinger was at the sentencing on crutches . The judge was a fine-boned man with a white friar 's cap and salmon-colored skin . He rustled papers and whispered to the bailiff while my lawyer read her statement . When she finished , he looked up and sentenced inc to one year in jail . With his next breath he suspended the sentence and put me on a year 's probation . Pleased , my lawyer took me out to lunch . Later , in the solitary darkness of number four , Krantz 's Kottage Kourt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probation was transferred and I was home in my parents ' house in Monrovia , California . My parents thought I was just a little late for Christmas vacation . It was a balmy night . We at in the living room and drank eggnog . I told them what I had done . Their opinion of me changed right before my eyes . Nobody ever spoke directly to me about my crime , but my criminal nature was constantly alluded to in embarrassed silences , unfinished sentences , gentle pats on my hand . I had to learn to ignore other people 's discomfort . I 'd had my trial . I 'd been assigned my punishment . It was a relief to visit my probation officer . Compared with her other customers , I was Pollyanna . We talked about modern art for half an hour and I was free to go . Sybil , Harry , Hulga , the Nun . One drawer was labeled Soup Bones . A student pulled it open . Inside were hands with wrists , and feet . I could n't stop staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That , " I said , and pointed to a foot . " Want me to pull it ? " " Please . " He drew on membranous plastic gloves and carried the foot to the tray on his desk . The skin was gray . The meat encircling the pearly hones was brown , the marrow inside the bone was purplish-black . The toes were tucked around almost to the ball . " The foot , " said the student , " is the terminal part of the vertebrate leg . Acupuncturists believe the entire body can be manipulated through the foot , but we Westerners have n't mapped out that nervous system ... " Over the top of the foot , I noticed a doorlike flap cut in the skin . The student flicked this open with tweezers . " The metatarsus is composed of five elongated bones ... " He tapped the gnarly white bones , which were attached to yellowish cartilage and skeins of grayish muscle . " The talus , or ankle , has a marvelously complex system of muscles which are responsible for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wickerwork . You see it ? " The foot , its innards revealed , revealed only its lack of life . I started to shiver . Quickly , I left the classroom , but it was too late : already , everything had shifted . Around me , I saw only the complicated braiding of matter , the endless intricacy of structure . And no life . It was a dizzying vision of filaments and pithiness . A tree was all threads . A bird was brittle skeleton and hairy feather , a dog ropy muscle , spiky hair . I tried to get hold of myself . Look , I thought , the tree grows , the bird flies , the dog saunters down the street . It did n't help . Movement seemed a trick of simple physics . No life in it at all . I could n't shake it , and the thought of seeing this way for the rest of my life made me panicky . I had to work it all back together again . At home , I rummaged through old boxes until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned over a year before . The scar had tarnished over , but it was still there , a jagged trough in the center of the rectangular surface . I chose my finest burin , its line as delicate as a synapse . For four months , I worked exclusively on that plate . My concentration was total , possibly escapist . Except when I was working , panic lapped darkly at the corners of my eyes . The gash posed an enormously difficult problem of composition . At first , I worked away from it , pretended it was n't there , that I had a clean plate like l 'd been used to before this one wasassigned to me , before I 'd gone to the Midwest , when the world was comfortable and complete and everything seemed possible . The more I worked around it , the more dominant the gash became . I did n't sleep well at night . I did n't talk to anybody . I wanted to be working all the time . In a state of agitation , I started digging into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plate . My fingernails became rimmed with ink at the trial printings and remained so for two more months . I awoke nights with pain against my skull and pulled forgotten burins from my hair . I was still living at home and making the long commute to Westwood . My studio was mostly my parents ' kitchen table . One morning , I got up to reheat the coffee and pour myself a cup . I looked down at the plate , and right before my eyes the myriad little lines popped into place . For a moment I did n't see the scar at all . I saw the image as a whole . It was a kind of wacky , very complex image not unlike some Chinese scrollwork : a foot that was also a tree and a map and a freeway and a mountain . It held together , though . I looked away , then checked again . Again , a gentle pop , a surprising settling into place . As a foot , it would never leap off the plate and dance or strut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . chuckled throughout the final printings . I made an edition of ten . Eight sold immediately . 1 gave one to my probation officer and kept one for myself . In a seminar on pre-Columbian art , I 'd learned how Woodland Indians used to crack their funerary pottery so that the spirit in the pot would be free . That 's what I thought about the day l sawed the plate in two . One more thing . List about a year ago , I got a Christmas card from the woman who 'd been my lawyer . She wrote : I thought you might be interested to know that I ran into Jon Doppinger at the opening of the new historical museum last week . I wish I could say that he does n't limp . Still , he 's got it down to an art . At least in a tuxedo , he managed to make that limp an enviable trait . I 'm not saying this just to make you feel better . Really , he looked quite dashing and the limp did n't hurt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed eager to talk . l le 's remarried . I is new wife looked all of twenty .

All the gory details as complete as I can make them . Anything more is unfounded speculation , party talk , and gossip . ?
