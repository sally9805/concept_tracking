Rationale for an invasion <P> Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon argues forcefully for an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon . Says he : " If we stick to our goals , this might be the last war we shall fight in the area . " So far , Prime Minister Menachem Begin has overruled his hawkish general , but Israel has built up its forces along its northern border and given warning that any new provocation by Palestinian guerrillas would invite a major military response . No one knows just how far Israel would go if it decides to invade . In talks between Israeli military officials and leaders of Lebanon 's right-wing Christian Phalange Party , several options have been considered . One is a coordinated pincer movement , with the Israelis moving north into Lebanon while the Christians push southward . Another option is all-out war , which would mean Israeli attacks not only on the forces of the Palestine Liberation Organization but on Syrian bases in Lebanon 's Bekaa Valley and along the Golan Heights . <P> The immediate Israeli military rationale for an attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guerrillas based there . Beyond that , Israel would like to help its allies , the Lebanese Christians , become stronger , and if possible force Syria to withdraw its 30,000-man peace-keeping force from Lebanon . To bolster his military aims , Sharon , with the backing of Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir , is also touting a political rationale for such a maneuver . He believes that the P.L.O . would have no place to go except Jordan , from which it was forcibly expelled in a brutal crackdown by King Hussein 's military in 1970-71 . With a little assistance from Israel , Sharon believes , the P.L.O . could overthrow King Hussein and establish a Palestinian state in Jordan . <P> Sharon 's plan has been quietly boosted by the Israeli Foreign Ministry , which has issued an English-language booklet titled Jordan is Palestine . The tract purports to show that the Hashemite Kingdom is already effectively a Palestinian state , since its population ( 2.2 million ) is more than 60% Palestinian . In Sharon 's view , if the P.L.O . were to take over Jordan with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more cooperative than one centered on the West Bank . <P> Sharon 's scheme has so far failed to convince Begin , who is a more cautious politician than either Sharon or Shamir . When asked about the proposal last week , an aide to the Prime Minister remarked : " That 's General Sharon 's own theory . It 's not Begin 's opinion . One can say that Begin admires King Hussein and believes he 's a brave man and he is able to survive . Begin thinks the P.L.O . is a source of trouble wherever it is . " Neither does Washington give much credence to the Sharon plan . " Farfetched , " said a U.S. intelligence official , adding : " It 's hard to imagine how you get the P.L.O . from Lebanon into Jordan and how they take over from Hussein . Would the Syrians stand for that ? It 's not at all clear that B follows from A. "
