Whatever Congress decided , they knew , they and their two children would have only two choices : return to Mexico or continue a furtive , fearful existence . Like some six million others in the United States , the latest working estimate , they are " undocumented " aliens. // If illegal aliens were considered a minority group , they would be the third-largest in the United States , behind black and Hispanic people . But they are officially invisible. // For perhaps three million of them , the immigration bill would have meant a new life in the open and eventually , if all conditions were met , full citizenship . But when Congress went home without approving the measure they faced , as before , an indefinite future. // Unlike citizens , the " undocumented " have no papers to prove their identity , at least none that are legitimate . They have no birth certificates , no resident alien cards , no passports , no Social Security numbers . They usually have no fixed address and no bank account . Many have no driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account and no medical record , not even names that are their own. // The accounts that follow tell of real " illegals , " but because their lives are clouded by the fear of apprehension and deportation , they have sometimes used names they chose to match their fraudulent papers. // // // Hector became an illegal alien in March 1981 , when he was 29 years old . He slipped across the border at Laredo and paid smugglers $350 to take him to Houston . Hector and 84 others made the trip in a horse van. // Several months later he paid $850 to have Maria and their children , then 4 and 8 years old , join him . Since then they have made a shaky but better life for themselves , living in a rented house trailer , paying $225 a month , and equipping it with a color television set and other appliances. // Hector earns $4. 12 an hour as a church janitor and is looking for a second job as a painter .

Hector borrowed the money from friends and is still repaying it. // Despite the problems of living in secret , Hector and Maria say their life here is a world apart from the unrelenting poverty they knew in Mexico , where bare necessities often seemed a luxury and there was often too little to eat. // " When we were living there , " said Hector , " sometimes my kids ' shoes , they are awful . I have to save before I can buy some new shoes for them . Now , when they say they need shoes , I say , ' O.K. , let ' s go buy them.

" // // // Sierra Lopez , who slipped across the border and came to Houston eight years ago , when he was 16 , had high hopes for the bill sponsored by Senator Alan K. Simpson and Representative Romano L. Mazzoli , which would probably have offered him temporary legal status and an eventual chance for citizenship. // Mr. Lopez , who is knowledgeable , was not concerned about the bill ' s requirement that , to become a citizen , he would have to demonstrate that he was proficient in English or was learning it and had or was acquiring a fundamental understanding of American history and government. // He is fiercely eager for special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction laborer , has been blind since February 1980 , when two men in a passing car , possibly because of some perceived affront in traffic , fired several shots at an automobile in which he was riding . One of the bullets hit Mr. Lopez in the right eye and severed an optic nerve , blinding him. // Since then he has sought help in vain , living with the assistance of charties and church groups. // " The thing I want most is job training , " he said . But because he acknowledges he was an illegal alien , he has been refused admission to publicly financed programs for the blind . Under the provisions of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill , he would probably have qualified for vocational training. // But even without such help , he said , " I can ' t return to Mexico .

" At the end of the week they tell you , ' I ' m only going to pay you $2 an hour . Take it if you want .
