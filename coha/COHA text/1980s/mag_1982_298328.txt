Another defeat fo Jesse Helms <P> The galleries of the ornate chamber were but two-thirds full , and the Senators chatted amiably and joked with one another as they filtered onto the floor last week . Yet if the mood seemed light and frivolous , the vote was decidedly not : for the fourth time in one week , Jesse Helms , Republican of North Carolina and sachem of the New Right , failed to end a liberal filibuster against his measure to allow organized prayer in public schools . With that defeat , his much vaunted agenda of social issues , ranging from banning abortions to prohibiting busing to imposing the death penalty , crumbled for the year . " This was a final rejection of the radical right in this chamber , " intoned Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York . " May we now go forward with the business of the nation , the Constitution intact and our purposes clear ? " <P> Two weeks ago , Helms was unable to choke off a similar filibuster against his bill to ban abortion . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to a bill raising the national debt ceiling ( from $1.143 trillion to $1.29 trillion ) . But before the Senate could vote on school prayer , Helms and his supporters needed to muster 60 votes to invoke cloture and shut off the talkathon against the bill spearheaded by Republican Lowell Weicker of Connecticut . <P> In the course of the four roll calls last week , Helms never got more than 54 votes in favor of ending the debate . At one point , the fight turned bitter , when Democratic Senator Dale Bumpers of Arkansas rose to speak against cloture . While accusing Helms of forcing embarrassing votes on liberal Senators so he can then lambaste them in their home states , Bumpers mistakenly referred to him as " the Senator from South Carolina . " Complained Helms : " Now he has moved me across the line . " Shot back Bumpers : " I apologize " ( pause ) " to the other state . " <P> Bumpers is hardly the only Senator who dislikes Helms . " There 's a lot of irritability about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just do n't need to deal with , " observes one moderate Republican . Neither is the North Carolinian considered an effective legislator by his colleagues : rather than focus on one issue , Helms decided to offer a passel of bills and amendments , thus muddying his own agenda . " He can block , but he ca n't pass , " noted an aide to the Senate leadership . At least one conservative Republican who knows a little about lost causes feels that Helms has simply misjudged the popularity of his crusade all along . " As Jesse gets older , he 'll understand that you only get what the people want , " says Barry Goldwater of Arizona . " Right now , the majority does n't want this at all . "
