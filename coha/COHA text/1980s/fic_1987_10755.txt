tasteless jokes ; even the best of them were only decent enough to remain silent , none decent enough to tell their crude companions to shut up . To me the " exhibits " in the ten-in-one demanded the same reverence as one might bring to the paintings of old masters in a museum , for they surely illuminate the meaning of life as well as the work of Rembrandtor Matisse or van Gogh . Like great art , these freaks can touch the heart , remind us of our primal fears , induce in us a humble appreciation for our own condition and existence , and embody the rage we usually feel when we are forced to consider the cold indifference of this imperfect universe . I saw none of those perceptions in the marks , though I might have been too hard on them . Nevertheless , before I had been in the tent more than two minutes , it seemed as if the real freaks were those who had paid to take this macabre tour . Anyway , they got their money 's worth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealing an extra pair of arms  --  stunted and withered but functional  --  growing out of his sides , just a couple of inches below and slightly behind a pair of ordinary , healthy arms . The lower appendages were somewhat deformed and obviously weak , but he was claspinga newspaper with them , while he used his regular hands to hold a cold drink and eat peanuts . In the next stall was Lila the Tattooed Lady , a self-made freak . After Lila came Flippo the Seal Boy , Mr. Six ( six toes on each foot , six fingers on each hand ) , the Alligator Man , Roberta the Rubber Woman , an albino simply called Ghost , and others presented for the " education and amazement of those who possess an inquiring mind and a healthy curiosity about the mysteries of life , " as the pitchman outside had put it . I moved slowly from stall to stall , one of the silent ones . At each exhibit I paused just long enough to determine whether or not this was the source of the psychic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been out on the concourse . I still felt it tugging ... . I went deeper into Shockville . The next human oddity was more well received by the marks than any other : Miss Gloria Neames , the 750-pound woman , who was supposed to be the fattest fat lady on earth . It was a claim I would not have considered disputing , neither the part about her size nor the part about her being a lady , for as gargantuan as she was , I nevertheless sensed in her ap101demure manner and sensitivity that were very appealing . She was seated on a specially built , sturdy chair . Getting up must have been difficult for her , and walking must have been nearly impossible without assistance ; even breathing was an ordeal , judging by the sound of her . She was a mountain of a woman in a red muumuu , with an enormous belly rolling up to an overhanging shelf of bosoms so immense that they ceased to have any recognizable anatomical purpose . Her arms looked unreal , like half-comic and half-heroic sculptures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her multiple chins drooped so far down her neck that they almost touched her breastbone . Her moon-round face was startling , serene like the face of a Buddha , but also unexpectedly beautiful ; within that bloated countenance , like an image superimposed on another photograph , was the arresting and moving promise of the thin and gorgeous Gloria Neames that might have been . Some of the marks liked Gloria because she gave them an opportunity to tease their girlfriends and wives  --  " You ever get that fat , baby , you better look for a freak-show job of your own , ' cause you sure are n't staying with me ! "  --  pretending to be joking but getting across an earnest message . And the wives and girlfriends , especially those at whom the message was aimed , those who were a little overweight themselves , liked Gloria because in her presence they felt positively svelte and stylish by comparison . Hell , beside her , Jelly would have looked like one of those starving Asian children in a magazinead for CARE . And nearly everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the freaks did not . She answered their questions and gracefully turned aside impertinentand too personal inquiries without embarrassing either herself or the jackasses who asked . Standing at the fat lady 's stall , I had the psychic impression that she would play an important role in my life , but I knew it was not Gloria who had drawn me into Shockville . That ominous and irresistible magnetism continued to tug at me , and I drifted toward the source , deeper into the sideshow tent . The last stall , the twelfth , was occupied by Joel Tuck , he of the cabbage ears , he of the steam-shovel mouth and bileyellowteeth , he of the Frankensteinian brow , he of the third eye , giant and freak and businessman and philosopher . He was reading a . book , oblivious of his surroundings  --  and ofp102me  --  but positioned so the marks could look up into his face and see every grim detail . This was what had drawn me . At first I thought the adducentpower that I felt was originating in Joel Tuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not all of it ; part of the magnetism came from the place , from the earthen floor of the stall . Beyond the rope and stanchions that delineated the limits of the public area , there was an open space , about six feet wide , between that line of demarcation and the edge of the wooden platform on which Joel Tuck sat . My eyes were drawn to that dusty , sawdust-covered patch of ground , and as I stared at it a dark heat rose from the earth , a disturbing warmth totally separate from the cloying August heat that stuck to every square foot of the midway ; this was a heat that only I could have felt . It had no smell , yet it was like the odorous steam rising off a bed of manure on the farm . It made me think of death , of the heat that is the product of decomposition and rises from a rotting body . I could not grasp what it signified , though I wondered if what I sensed was that this spot would become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , as I dwelt on that shuddery possibility , I became increasingly certain that I stood at the brink of a grave that would be opened in the near future and that some bloody corpse would be stashed there in the deepest hours of the night , and that " Why , if it is n't Carl Slim , " Joel said , finally noticing me . " Oh , no , wait , sorry . Just Slim , was n't it ? Slim Mac-Kenzie . " He was poking fun at me , and I smiled , and the occult emanations rising from the ground faded quickly : dim , dimmer , gone . The river of marks had ceased to flow for a moment , and I was temporarily alone with Joel . I said , " How 's business ? " " Good . It 's almost always good , " he said in that mellowrichtimbre , like the announcer on an FM station that played only classical music . " And what of you ? Are you getting what you wanted from the carnival ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , better than just pocket money  --  yeah , I 'm doing all right . " " Anonymity ? " he asked . " That , too , I guess . " " Sanctuary ? " " So far . "  |p103As  before , I sensed in this strange man a fatherliness , an ability and willingness to provide comfort , friendship , guidance . But I also sensed , as I had before , danger in him , an indefinable threat , and I could not understand how he could encompass both potentials in regard to me . He might be mentor or enemy , one or the other but surely not both , yet I felt those conflicting possibilities in him , so I did not open myself to him as I might otherwise have done . " What do you think of the girl ? " he asked from his seat upon the platform . " What girl ? " " Is there any other ? " " You mean . . . Rya Raines ? " " Do you like her ? " " Sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " What else ? " " Ask nearly any other man on this midway what he thinks of Miss Rya Raines , and he 'll rhapsodize for half an hour about her face and body  --  and gripe for another half hour about her personality , and then he 'll rhapsodize some more , but he 'll never just say , She 's all right ' and be done with it . " " She 's nice . " " You 're infatuated , " he said , his bony jaws working laboriously , his yellow teeth clacking together when he stressed the harder consonants . " Oh . . . no . No . Not me , " I said . " Bullshit . " I shrugged . His orange eye fixing me with a blind yet penetrating stare , his other two eyes rolling with mock impatience , he said , " Oh , come , come , of course you are . Infatuated . Maybe worse . Maybe falling in love . " " Well , really , she 's older than me , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But still older . " " And in terms of experience and wit and intelligence , you 're older than your years , at least as old as she is . Stop fencing with me , Slim MacKenzie . You 're infatuated . Admit it . " Well , she 's very beautiful . " " And beneath ? "  | " Huh ? " " Beneath ? " he repeated . " Are you asking if her beauty is more than skin deep ? " " Is it ? " he asked . Surprised at how successfully he was drawing me out , I said , " Well , she likes you to think she 's hard-bitten . . . but inside . . . well , I see some qualities every bit as attractive as her face . " He nodded . " I would agree . " Farther back in the tent , a group of laughing marks approached . Talking faster , leaning forward in his chair to take advantage of our last moments of privacy , Joel said , " But you know . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bleak mood in which I had left her last night , the clutching loneliness and despair that seemed to be dragging her down into some dark , private pit . " Yes , I 'm aware of it . I do n't know where it comes from , that sadness , or what it means , but I am aware of it . " " Here 's something to think about , " he said , then hesitated . " What ? " He peered at me with such intensity that I could almost believe he was reading my soul with some psychic power of his own . Then he sighed and said , " Such a stunningly beautifulsurface she has , and beauty underneath , as well , we 're agreed on that . . . but is it possible that there is another underneath ' below the underneath ' that you can see ? " I shook my head . " I do n't think she 's a deceiving person . " " Oh , we all are , my young friend ! We all deceive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow creature we meet . Some of us deceive only selected people , wives and lovers , or mothers and fathers . And some of us deceive only ourselves . But none of us is totally honest with everyone all the time , in all matters . Hell , the need to deceive is just one more curse that our sorry species has to bear . " " What are you trying to tell me about her ? " I asked . " Nothing , " he said , his tension suddenly flowing away . He leaned back in his chair : " Nothing . " " Why are you being so cryptic ? " " Me ? " " Cryptic . " " I would n't know how , " he said , his mutant face bearing the most enigmatic expression I had ever seen on anyone.  |p105The  marks reached the twelfth stall , two couples in their early twenties , the girls with heavily lacquered bouffant hair and too much makeup , the guys in checkered slacks and clashing shirts , a quartet of country sophisticates . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she saw Joel Tuck . The other girl squealed because her friend had done it , and the men put protective arms around their women , as if there were a real danger that Joel Tuck would bound off his small stage with either rape or cannibalism in mind . While the marks made their comments , Joel Tuck lifted his book and returned to his reading , ignoring them when they asked questions of him , retreating into a dignity so solid that it was almost tangible . In fact , it was a dignity that even the marks could sense and that , in time , intimidated them into respectful silence . More marks arrived , and I stood there for a moment longer , watching Joel , breathing in the odors of sun-heated canvas and sawdust and dust . Then I let my gaze slide to that patch of sawdust-covered earth between the rope and the platform , and again I received images of decomposition and death , but no matter how hard I tried , I could not figure out exactly what these dark vibrations meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this dirt would be turned with a spade to make a grave for me . I knew I would come back . When the midway was closed down . When the freaks were gone . When the tent was deserted . I would sneak back to stare at this portentous plot of dirt , to place my hands against the ground , to attempt to wrench a more explicit warning from the psychic energy that was concentrated here . I had to armor myself against the oncoming danger , and I could not do that until I knew precisely what the danger was . When I left the ten-in-one and returned to the concourse , the twilight sky was the same color as my eyes. * * *Because it was the next to the last night of the engagement , and a Friday , the marks lingered longer , and the midwayclosed up later than the night before . It was almost one-thirty by the time I had locked away the teddy bears at the high-striker and , laden with coins that jingled with every step I took , went down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wispy clouds were backlit by the moon , which painted their lacy edges purest silver . They filigreed the night sky . Having dealt with her other cashiers already , she was waiting for me , dressed much as she had been the night before : pale green shorts , white T-shirt , no jewelry , no need of jewelry , more radiant in her unadorned beauty than she could have been in any number of diamond necklaces . She was in an uncommunicative mood , speaking only when spoken to , then responding in monosyllables . She took the money , put it away in a closet , and gave me half a day 's wages , which I tucked into a pocket of my jeans . As she performed these chores I watched her intently , not merely because she was lovely but because I had not forgottenlast night 's vision , just outside the trailer , when an apparitionalRya , smeared with blood and bleeding from one corner of her mouth , had shimmered into existence before my eyes and had softly pleaded with me not to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the real Rya once more , I 'd find my clairvoyance stimulated , that new and more detailed premonitionswould come to me , so I could warn her about a specific danger . But all that I got from being close to her again was a renewed sense of the deep sadness in her  --  and sexually aroused . Once paid , I had no excuse to hang around . I said good night and went to the door . " Tomorrow will be a busy day , " she said before ' I took that first step out . I looked back at her . " Saturdays always are . " " And tomorrow night is slough night  --  we tear it all down . " And Sunday we would set up in Yontsdown , but I did not want to think about that . She said , " There 's always so much to do on Saturdays that I have trouble sleeping Friday nights . " I suspected that , like me , she had trouble sleeping most nights and that , when she did sleep , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know what you mean . " " Walking helps , " she said . " Sometimes , on Friday nights , I go out on the dark midway and walk around and around the promenade , working off excess energy , letting the stillness sort of . . . flow into me . It 's peaceful when it 's shuttered , when the marks are gone and the lights are out . Even better ... when we 're playing at a place like this , where the fairgroundsare in open country , I walk the nearby fields or evenp107the woods if there 's a road through them or a good trail  --  and if there 's a moon . " Except for her stern lecture about operating the high-striker , this was the longest speech I had heard her make , and it was the closest she had come to trying to establish rapport with me , but her voice remained as impersonal and businesslike as it was during working hours . In fact , it was even cooler than before because it was without the effervescent excitement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat voice now , indifferent , as if all purpose and meaning and interest fled her with the closing of the midway and did not return until the next day 's show call . Indeed it was such a flat voice , so drab and weary , that without the special insight of my sixth sense I might have been unaware that she was actually reaching out to me , in need of human contact . I knew that she was trying to be casual , even friendly , but that did not come easy to her . " There 's a moon tonight , " I said . " Yes . " " And fields nearby . " " Yes . " " And woods . " She looked down at her bare feet . " I was planning on taking a walk myself , " I said . Without meeting my eyes she went to the armchair , in front of which she had left a pair of tennis shoes . She slipped into them and came to me . We walked . We wound through the temporary streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wild grass was black and silver in the night-shadows and moonbeams . It was also knee-high and must have tickled her bare legs , but she did not complain . We walked in silence for a while , at first because we were too awkward with each other to settle into comfortable conversation , then because conversation began to seem unimportant . At the edge of the meadow , we turned northwest , following the line of trees , and a welcome breeze rose at our backs . The towering ramparts of the post-midnight forest rose with castellatedformidability , as if they were not serried ranks of pines and maples and birches but , instead , solid black barriers that could n't be breached , only scaled . Eventually , half a mile behind the midway , we came to a place where a single-lanep108dirt road split the woods , leading upward into night and strangeness . Without a word to each other we turned onto the road and kept walking , and we went perhaps another two hundred yards before she finally spoke . " Do you dream ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Goblins , " I said truthfully , although I would begin to lie if she pressed me for elucidation . " Nightmares , " she said . " Yes . " " Are your dreams usually nightmares ? " " Yes . " Although those Pennsylvania mountains lacked the vastness and the sense of a primordial age that made the Siskiyous so impressive , there was nonetheless a humbling silence of the sort to be found only in the wilderness , a hush more reverent than that in a cathedral , which encouraged us to speak softly , almost in whispers , though there was no one to overhear . " Mine too , " she said . " Nightmares . Not just usually . Always . " " Goblins ? " I asked . " No . " She said no more , and I knew she would tell me more only when she chose to . We walked . The forest crowded close on both sides . In the moonlight the dirt road had a gray phosphorescence that made it look like a bed of ash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods , wheels burning with divine fire , leaving a trail of total combustion . In a while she said , " Graveyards . " " In your dreams ? " She spoke as softly as the breeze . " Yes . Not always the same graveyard . Sometimes it 's on a flat field , stretching to every horizon , one headstone after the other , all of them exactly alike . " Her voice became softer still . " And sometimes it 's a snowy cemetery on a hill , with leafless trees that have lots of black and spiky branches , and with tombstones terracing down and down , all different kinds of them , marble obelisks and low granite slabs , statues that 've been tilted and worn by too many winters . . . and I keep walking toward the bottom of the cemetery , the bottom of the hill . . . toward the road that leads out . . . and I 'm sure there 's a road downp109there somewhere . . . but I just ca n't find it . " Her tone was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cold line drawn along my spine , as if her voice were an icy blade impressed upon my skin . " At first I move slowly between monuments , afraid of slipping and falling in the snow , but when I go down several levels and still do n't see the road below . . . I start moving faster . . . and faster . . . and pretty soon I 'm running , stumbling , falling , getting up , running on , dodging between the stones , plunging down the hillside . . . " A pause . A breath . Shallow . Expelled with a faint sigh of dread and with a few more words : " Then you know what I find ? " I thought I did . As we reached the crest of a low hill and kept walking , I said , " You see a name on one of the tombstones , and it 's yours . " She shuddered . " One of them is mine . I sense it in every dream . But I never find it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... if I found it . . . found my own grave . . . then I would stop dreaming about these things .... " Because you would not wake up , I thought . You would be dead for real . That was what they said happened if you did not wake up before you died in a dream . Die in a dream  --  and never wake up again . She said , " What I find when I go down the hillside far enough ' is . . . the road I 'm looking for . . . except it is n't a road any more . They 've buried people and erected headstones right in the asphalt , as if they had so many to plant that they ran out of room in the graveyard and had to put them whereverthere was space . Hundreds of stones , four across , row after row , all the way along the road . So . . . you see . . . the road is n't a way out any more . It 's just another part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more monumentsjust keep shelving down and down , as far as I can see . And the worst thing is . . . somehow I know that all these people are dead . . . because ... " " Because what ? " " Because of me , " she said miserably . " Because I killed them . " " You sound as if you actually feel guilty , " I said . " I do . " " But it 's only a dream . " " When I wake up . . . it lingers . . . too real for a dream . It has more meaning than just a dream . It 's an omen , maybe . "  | " But you 're not a killer . " " No . " " Then what could it mean ? " " I do n't know , " she said . " Just dreamstuff , nonsense , " I insisted . " No . " " Then tell me how it makes sense . Tell me what it means . " " I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had the disturbing impression that she knew precisely what the dream meant and that she had now begun to lie to me just as I would have lied if she had pressed for too many details about the goblins of my own nightmares . We had followed the dirt road up and then down a gentle hill , along a quarter-of-a-mile curve , through a hurst of oaks where there was less moonlight , perhaps a distance of one mile altogether . Finally we came to the road 's end on the shore of a small lake surrounded by forest . The gently sloping bank that led into the water was covered with lush , soft grass . The lake looked like an enormous pool of oil and would have looked like nothing whatsoever if the moon and scattered frost-white stars had not been reflected in its surface , thereby vaguely illuminating a few eddies and ripples . The breeze-ruffled grass , like that in the meadow behind the trailer town , was black with a thin silver edge to each tender blade . She sat down on the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence again . I obliged . Sitting beneath the vault of night , listening to far crickets and the quiet splash of fish taking insects off the surface of the water , conversation was again quite unnecessary . It was enough for me to be at her side , separated from her by less than the length of an arm . I was struck by the contrast between this place and those in which I had spent the rest of this day . First Yontsdown , with its smokestacks and medieval buildings and omnipresent sense of impending doom , then the midway with its gaudy pleasuresand swarms of marks . It was a relief , now , to pass a little time in a place where there was no proof of man 's existence other than the dirt road leading in , which we kept at our backs and which I tried to put out of mind . Gregarious by nature , there nevertheless were occasions when I became as weary of the company of other human beings as I was re/pelled and disgusted by the goblins . And sometimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another as the marks had been in Joel Tuck 's sideshow tent that very day , it seemed to me that we deserved the goblins , that we were a tragically flawed race incapable of adequately appreciating the miracle of our existence and that we had earned the vicious attentions of the goblins by our own despicable actionsagainst one another . After all , many of the gods we worshiped were , to one degree or another , judgmental and demanding and capable of heart-stopping cruelty . Who could say that they might not visit a plague of goblins on us and call it just punishment for sins indulged ? Here , in the tranquillity of the forest , however , a cleansing energy washed through me , and gradually I began to feel better , in spite of all the talk of graveyards and nightmares with which we had occupied ourselves . Then , after a while , I became aware that Rya was weeping . She made no sound , and her body was not racked with silent sobs . I was alerted to her condition only when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadness , welling up anew in her . Looking sidewise , I saw a glistening tear tracking down her smooth cheek , another spot of silver in the moonlight . " What 's wrong ? " I asked . She shook her head . " Do n't want to talk ? " She shook her head again . Acutely aware that she needed comforting , that she had come to me expressly for comforting , but not knowing how to provide it , I turned my eyes from her and looked out at the oily blackness of the lake . She shorted out my logic circuits , damn it . She was different from anyone I had ever known , with puzzling depths and dark secrets , and it seemed to me that I dared not respond to her as casually and forthrightly as I would have responded to anyone else . I felt as if I were an astronaut making first contact with an alien from another world , overwhelmed by an appreciation for the gulf between us , afraid to proceed lest the initial communication be misunderstood . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act . I told myself  --  that I had been foolish to dream of heating the coolness between us , that I had been an idiot for imagining that a close relationship with her was possible , that I had gotten in over my head with this one , that these watersp112were too dark and strange , that I would never understand her and -- and then she kissed me . She pressed her pliant lips to mine , and her mouth opened to me , and I returned her kiss with a passion I had never experienced before , our tongues seeking and melting together until I could not tell hers from mine . I put both hands in her glorious hair  --  an auburn-blond mix in daylight but now argentine  --  and let it run through my fingers . It felt the way spun moonlight might feel if it could be fashioned into a cool and silken thread . I touched her face , and the texture of her skin sent a shiver through me . I slid my hands lower , along her neck , holding her by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her full breasts . From the moment she had leaned against me and had given that first kiss , she had been shaking . I sensed that these were not tremors of erotic anticipation , but were evidence of an uncertainty , awkwardness , shyness , and fear of rejection not dissimilar to my own state of mind . Now , suddenly , a stronger shiver passed through her . She pulled away from me and said , " Oh , hell . " " What ? " I asked , breathless . " Why ca n't ... " " What ? " " . . . two people ... " " What ? " Tears streamed down her face now . Her voice quavered : " ... just reach out to each other ... " " You reached , I reached . " " ... and push aside that barrier ... " " There 's no barrier . Not now . " I sensed that sadness in her , a well of loneliness too deep to be plumbed , a grayness , an apartness , and I was afraid that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , force upon us the very estrangement that she professed to fear . She said , " It 's there . . . always there . . . always so hard to make any real contact . . . any real ... " " It 's easy , " I said . " No . " " We 're more than halfway . " " ... a pit , a gulf ... "  | " Shut up , " I said as gently and lovingly as I had ever said two words , and I took hold of her again , kissed her again . We kissed and caressed with rapidly increasing fervor but with a determination to savor this first exploration . Although we must have sat there on the grass for no more than five or ten minutes , it seemed that whole days passed unheeded . When she again pulled away from me , I started to protest . But she said , " Hush , " in such a way that I knew I should be quiet . She rose to her feet , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring a chill to ardor , her clothes slipped away from her , and she stood thrillingly revealed . Even at night in this dark woods , she seemed to be the daughter of the sun , for moonglow was nothing more than a reflection of solar light , and now every beam of that secondhandsunshine appeared to find its way to her . The rays of the moon made her skin translucent and accentuated the exquisitelysensuous curves and planes , convexities and concavities , of her faultless body . Eros in a fluid interfolding of black and silver : the frost-silver sphere of firm buttocks , perfectly cleft by darkness ; a frostlike film molded to the enticing musculature of one thigh ; a few crisp , shiny pubic hairs touched by a glint of silver ; the concavity of her belly , curving from the pearly touch of moonlight into a smooth little pocket of shadow , then swelling back into the pearliness again before reaching the darkness beneath the heavy breasts ; and -- oh , yes  --  her breasts , uptilted , heart-rendingly contoured , the turgid nipples painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , platinum light shone upon  --  and seemingly from within  --  her elegant , smooth shoulders , traced the delicateline of her throat , and licked along the fragile ridges and folds of one shell-like ear . She descended like some celestial entity , as from a great height , with slow grace , and lay upon the thick , soft grass . I undressed . I made love to her with hands , with lips , with tongue , and before I even considered entering her , I had brought her twice to climax . I was not a great lover  --  far from it ; my sexual experience was limited to two women at other carnivals before this one . But through my sixth sense I always seemed to know what was wanted , what would please . Then , as she lay sprawled on that bed of black grass , I parted her sleek thighs and moved between them . The initialp114moment of penetration was the usual and unremarkable anatomicalmechanics , but as we joined , the experience ceased to be usual , ceased to be unremarkable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not merely lovers but a simple organism , instinctively and mindlessly pursuing some half-glimpsed , mysterious , but desperately desired apotheosisof both spirit and body . Her responsiveness to me seemed as psychic as mine to her . As she clung to me , she never . moved in disruptive opposition , or murmured the wrong word , or in any way disturbed the deeply satisfying and astonishingly complex rhythms of our passion , but matched each flex and counterflex , each thrust and counterthrust , each shuddering pause , each throb and stroke , until we had achieved and then surpassed flawless harmony . The world receded . We were one ; we were all ; we were the only . In that sublime and almost holy condition , ejaculation seemed like a gross affront , not a natural conclusion to our coupling but a crude intrusion of base biology . But it was inevitable . Indeed it was not only inescapable , but also not long in arriving . I had been within her perhaps four or five minutes when I felt the eruption building and realized , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to withdraw from her , but she clasped me closer , entwining me with her slender legs and arms , her sex tightening heatedly around mine , and I managed to gasp out the impending danger of impregnation , but she said , " It 's all right , Slim , it 's all right , I ca n't have babies , anyway , no babies , it 's all right , just come in me , honey , please , come in me , fill me , " and with the last few words she was shaken by another orgasm , and she arched her body against me , pressed her breasts against my chest , tremors racking her , and suddenly I was unknotted and untied , and long , fluid ribbons of sperm spooled out of me , unraveled within her . We were a long time regaining a sense of the world around us and even longer parting . But at last we lay side by side , on our backs in the grass , staring up at the night sky , holding hands . We were silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said had already been said without resorting to words . Perhaps five long , warm minutes passed before she said , " Who are you , Slim MacKenzie ? " " Just me . " " Somebody special . " " Are you kidding ? Special ? I could n't control myself.  |p115Went  off like fireworks . Jeez . I promise more control next time . I 'm no great lover , no Casanova , that 's for sure , but I usually have more endurance than  --  " " Do n't , " she said softly . " Do n't bring it down like that . Do n't pretend it was n't the most natural , the most exciting ... the most most you ever knew . Because it was . It was . " " But I  --  " " It lasted long enough . Just long enough . Now shush . " I shushed . The filigree of clouds had blown away . The sky was crystalline . The moon was a Lalique globe . This extraordinary day of contrasts had encompassed the most appalling ugliness and horror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost excruciating in its intensity . The leering goblins in Yontsdown . To compensate for them : Rya Raines . The grim grayness of that miserable city . To balance : this splendid canvas of moon and stars under which I now lay , satiated . The visions of fire and death at the elementary school . On the other hand : the memory of her moonlightkissedbody descending to the grass with a promise of joy . Without Rya it would have been a day of unimaginably stark and unrelieved despair . There on the shore of that dark lake , she seemed , at least in that moment , to be the embodiment of all that had gone right in the divine architect 's plans for the universe , and if I could have located God right then , I would have yanked insistently on the hem of his robe and kicked at his shins and would have made a general nuisance of myself until He agreed that He would reconstruct those vast portions of His creation that He had screwed up the first time , and that during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of what was possible if only He would put all his mind and talent behind the project . Joel Tuck was wrong . I was not infatuated with her . I was in love with her . God help me , I was in love with her . And although I did not know it then , the time was rapidly approaching when , because of my love for her , I would desperately need God 's help merely to survive . After a while she let go of my hand and sat up , drew her knees up , clasped her arms around her bent legs , and stared out at the lightless lake , in which a fish splashed once and then swam on in silence . I sat up beside her , and still we felt no need to be any more talkative than the swimming fishes.  |p116Another  distant splash . A rustle of wind-stirred reeds at water 's edge . Cricket song . Mournful mating calls of lonely frogs . In time I realized that she was weeping again . I put a hand to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? " I asked . She said nothing . " Tell me , " I said . " Do n't , " she said . " Do n't what ? " " Talk . " I was silent . She was silent . Eventually the frogs were silent . When she finally spoke , she said , " The water looks inviting . " " Looks wet is all . " " Appealing . " " Probably covered with algae , and the bottom 's mud . " " Sometimes , " she said , " in Gibtown , Florida , during the off-season , I go out to the beach and take long walks , and sometimes I think how nice it would be to swim out into the sea , out and out , just keep on and never come back . " There was a shocking spiritual and emotional weariness in her , a distressing melancholy . I wondered if it had something to do with her inability to have children . But mere barrenness seemed insufficient cause for this black despondency . At this moment her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corroded by a bitter sadness of such purity and acidic strength that the source of it defied imagination . I could not understand how she could plummet . from ecstasyto despondency so quickly . Only minutes ago she had told me that our lovemaking had been the most most . Now she was almost gladly sinking back into despair , into an utterly hopeless , sapping , sunless , private desolation that scared the hell out of me . She said , " Would n't it be nice to swim out as far as you could go and then , exhausted , swim even farther , until your arms become like lead and your legs like a diver 's weights and  --  " " No ! " I said sharply , grabbing her face in both hands , turning her head , forcing her to look at me . " No , it wouldn'tp117be nice . It would n't be nice at all . What are you saying ? What 's wrong with you ? Why are you like this ? " There was neither an answer on her lips nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was impenetrable even to my sixth sense , a loneliness that seemed ultimately impervious to any assaults I could hope to make on it . Seeing this , my gut clenched with fear , and my heart , felt hollow and dead , and tears filled my own eyes . In desperation I pulled her down onto the grass , kissed her , caressed her , and began to make love to her again . At first she was reluctant , but then she began to respond , and soon we were as one , and this time , in spite of the talk of suicide and in spite of the fact that she would not allow me to understand the cause of her despair , we were better together than we had been before . If passion was the only rope that I could find to throw to her , if it was the only thing that could pull her back from the spiritual quicksand that was sucking her under , then it was at least reassuring to know that my passion for her was a lifeline of infinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other 's arms , and the quality of our mutual silence did not degenerate into funereal gloom , as it had done before . In time we dressed and started back along the forest road , toward the fairgrounds . I was buoyed by the beginning that we had made tonight , and I was filled with a hope for the future that I had not known since the day I had first seen a goblin . I wanted to shout , throw my head back , laugh at the moon , but I did nothing of the sort , for with each step of our return from the wilderness , I was also afraid , deeply frightened that she would once again oscillate from happiness to despair , that this time she would not ever swing back to the light again . And I was afraid , as well , of the not-forgotten vision of her bloody face and what that vision might portend . This was a mad brew of conflicting emotions and not easily kept below boil , especially not for a seventeen-year-old boy far from home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need of some affection , purpose , and stability . Fortunately Rya remained in a good mood all the way back to the door of her Airstream trailer , sparing me the dispiriting sight of a new descent into those melancholy realms and leaving me with some small measure of confidence that eventually I could persuade her to turn away forever from consideration of that suicidal swim into the uncaring embrace of the surging Florida seas.  |p118As  for the vision . . . well , I would have to find a way to help her avoid the danger ahead . Unlike the past , the future could be changed . At her door we kissed . She said , " I can still feel you within me , your seed , still so hot inside me , burning . I 'll take it to bed with me , curl myself around the heat of your seed , and it 'll be like a watch fire through the night , keeping the bad dreams away . No graveyards tonight , Slim . No , not tonight . " Then she went in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goblins , who fill me with a paranoid tension when I 'm awake and who disturb my sleep with nightmares , I am accustomed to insomnia . For years I have lived with little sleep , a few hours most nights , none at all on some nights , and gradually my metabolism has adjusted to the fact that my raveled sleeve of care will never be entirely mended . Tonight , again , I was wide-awake , though it was now four o'clock in the morning , but at least this time the cause of my insomnia was irrepressible joy rather than cold terror . I walked up to the midway . I followed the concourse , preoccupied with thoughts of Rya . Such a torrent of vivid images of Rya filled my mind that I would not have believed there was room for thoughts of a different kind . But in a while I realized that I had stopped walking , that my fists were clenched at my sides , that a chill had taken possession of me , that I was standing in front of Joel Tuck 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was staring at the Snap Wyatt banners strung across the front of the tent . Those portraits of the freaks were more disturbing now , in the fading moonbeams that barely limned them , than they were in the uncompromising light of day , for it was within the power of the human imagination to conjure up worse atrocities than even God could commit . While my conscious mind had been fixated on Rya , my subconscious had dragged me here for the purpose of investigating that patch of earth in the twelfth stall , from which I had received strong psychic impressions of death . Perhaps my own death . I did not want to go in there . I wanted to walk away.  |p119As  I stared at the snugged-down flaps of the tent 's entrance , the desire to walk away became an urge to run . But a key to my future lay within . I had to know exactly what psychic magnet had drawn me there yesterday afternoon . To maximize my chances for survival , I had to knowwhy death energies had radiated from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I had sensed that very plot of ground might become my own grave . I told myself that there was nothing to fear in the tent . The freaks were not here but in their trailers , fast asleep . Even if they had still been in the tent , none of them would have harmed me . And the tent itself was not inherently dangerous or evil , just a large canvas structure , haunted ( if at all ) bynothing worse than the stupidity and thoughtlessness of ten thousand marks . Nevertheless , I was afraid . Afraid , I went to the securely belayed canvas flaps that closed off the entrance . At the flaps I untied one line , trembling . Trembling , I went inside.  |p120Humid  darkness . The smell of weathered canvas . Sawdust . I stood just inside Shockville , very still , alert , listening . The large , chambered tent was perfectly quiet but had a peculiar resonance , like a giant conch shell , so I heard the imitation oceanic susurration of my own blood flowing through the vessels in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the late hour , I had the hair-raising feeling that I was not alone . Squinting into the impenetrable gloom , I stooped and withdrewthe knife from my boot . Having the blade in my hand did not make me feel more secure . It was of little use to me if I could not see from which direction the attack was coming . The sideshow was on the perimeter of the midway and within easy access of the fairgrounds ' public power lines ; therefore , it was not tied to the carnival 's generators , and I did not need to start a diesel engine to turn on a light . I felt through the darkness to the left and then to the right of the entrance , searching for either a light switch mounted on a stanchion or a pull chain dangling from the ceiling . My psychic sense of danger grew stronger.  |p121Attack  seemed more imminent by the second . Where the hell was that switch ? I fumbled , found a thick wooden pole along which snaked a flexible , segmented power cable . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing . Then I realized the breathing had been my own . An inconvenientfeeling of foolishness briefly incapacitated me . I stood in lumpish stupidity , awash in that chagrin familiar to anyone who , as a child , had lain awake for hours in fear of the monster under the bed , only to discover upon courageous inspection that the monster did not exist or was , at worst , only a pair of old , worn tennis shoes . However , the clairvoyant impression of impending violencedid not lessen . Quite the opposite . Danger seemed to coagulate in the humid , musty air . I blindly traced the segmented cable with trembling fingers , found a junction box , a switch . I flicked it . Overhead , along the roped-off walkway and in the stalls behind the ropes , bare bulbs brightened . Knife in hand , I proceeded cautiously past the empty stall where Jack-Four-Hands had displayed himself yesterday afternoonand where his pathetic history was still recorded on a canvas backdrop , from the first room to the second , from second to third , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stall , where Joel Tuck usually took up his station , where now the threat of death was oppressive , a menacing current in the air that electrified me . I stepped up to the rope at Joel Tuck 's stall . The patch of sawdust-sprinkled earth in front of the platformwas , to me , as radiant as a mass of plutonium , although it was not deadly gamma particles that streamed from it . Instead I was exposed to uncountable roentgens of death images  --  and smells and sounds and tactile sensations  --  which were beyond the apprehension of the five senses I share with other human beings but which registered and were read upon the Geiger counter of my sixth . Sense , my clairvoyance . I sensed : open graves in which darkness pooled like stagnant blood ; time-bleached bones in piles with spiderweb monoclesin the empty skull sockets ; the scent of moist , newly turned earth ; the heavy grating of a stone lid being slidp122laboriously off a sarcophagus ; bodies on slabs in rooms that stank of formaldehyde ; the sweet stench of cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dankness of a subterranean tomb ; the thunk of a wooden coffin lid dropping shut ; a cold hand pressing dead fingers to my face .. . " Jesus , " I said , my voice shaky . The precognitive flashes  --  which were , for the most part , symbolic of death rather than representative of real scenes to come in my life  --  were much stronger and much worse now than they had been yesterday afternoon . I raised one hand and wiped my face . I was sheathed in cold sweat . Trying to marshal the jumble of psychic impressions into some meaningful order , yet struggling not to be overwhelmed by them , I swung one leg over the restraining rope , then the other leg , and stepped into the stall . I was afraid of losing consciousness in the clairvoyant storm . That was unlikely , but it had happened on a couple of other occasions , when I had encountered particularly powerful charges of occult energy , and each time I had awakened hours later with a severe headache . I dared not pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much malignant promise . If I lost consciousness in Shockville , I would be killed where I fell . I was sure of that . I knelt on the earthen floor in front of the platform . Go , leave , get out ! an inner voice warned . Gripping the knife so hard that my right hand ached and my knuckles popped up in bloodless white points , I used my left hand to brush away the layer of sawdust from a yardsquarearea . Underneath , the dirt was stamped down but not hard-packed . I was able to dig into it easily with just my bare hands . The first inch came up in chunks , but farther down the soil was looser , precisely the opposite of what ought to have been . Someone had dug a hole here within the last couple of days . No . Not a hole . Not merely a hole . A grave . But whose ? What body lay below me ? I did not really want to know . I had to know . I continued scraping the soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that this excavation had the potential to become my grave grew stronger as I clawed at the earth . Yet that did not seem possible because , clearly , anotherp123corpse was already in tenancy . Perhaps I was misinterpreting the psychic emanations , a distinct possibility , for I was not always capable of making sense of the vibrations to which my sixth sense was attuned . I put my knife aside so I could scoop the earth away with both hands , and in a couple of minutes I had made a hole about a yard long and two feet wide , six or eight inches deep . I knew I should go find a shovel , but the soil was quite loose , and I did not know where to look for a shovel , and besides , I could not stop . I was compelled to keep digging without even the briefest pause , driven by a morbid and crazy but undismissable certainty that the occupant of this grave would prove to be me , that I would pull the dirt off my own face and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror caused by the unrelenting outpouring of frightening psychic images , I tore at the yielding earth in a frenzy now , dripping a cold brine from brow and nose and chin , grunting like an animal , panting , lungs afire . I burrowed deeper , snorting in disgust at the ripe psychic scent of death as if it were a real odordeeper  --  but there was actually no reek of decay in the sideshowtent , only in my mind  --  deeper  --  because the corpse was too fresh to have undergone more than the earliest , mildest stages of decomposition . Deeper . My hands were filthy , my fingernails caked with dirt , and bits of soil flew into my hair and stuck to my face as my burrowing became wilder still . A part of me drifted back and up , looking down on the frantic animal that I had become , and that detached part of me wondered if I was mad , just as it had wondered about the stark and tortured face in the locker-room mirror the night before last . A hand . Pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before me , in a position of final relaxation , as if the dirt around it were a mortuary blanket on which it had been placed with tender care . Dried blood was crusted on the fingernails and in the creases of the knuckles . The psychic death images began to fade as I now made contact with the real object of death from which they had flowed . I had dug down perhaps a foot and a half , and now I carefully scooped more soil out until I had found a secondp124hand , half overlaying the first . . . and the wrists . . . and part of the arms . . . until it became evident that the deceased had been laid to rest in the traditional position , with the arms folded across the chest. , Then , alternately unable to breathe and hyperventilating , racked by spasms of fear that made my teeth chatter , I began to excavate more extensively above the hands . A nose . A broad forehead . A harp-string glissando , not of sound but of cold vibration , passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush all the earth away from the face , for I knew when it was half uncovered that it was the man  --  the goblin  --  I had killed in the Dodgem Car pavilionthe night before last . His eyelids were shut , both with a glaucous tint that made it look as if someone of perverse humor had applied eye shadow to him before committing him to the ground . His upper lip was curled back at one corner , in a rigor-mortis sneer , and dirt was packed between his teeth . Out of the corner of my eye , I saw movement in another part of the tent . I gasped , snapped my head around , toward the promenade beyond the rope , but no one was there . I was convinced I had seen something move , and then , before I could even get up from the grave to investigate , I saw it again  --  dervish shadowsthat leapt off the sawdust-carpeted floor , onto the far wall of the tent , then back to the floor again . They were accompanied by a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last chamber of the tent and was shuffling toward me , not yet in sight of the fourth stall but only a few lumbering steps away . Joel Tuck ? Clearly it was he who had spirited the dead goblin out of the Dodgem Car pavilion and buried it here . I had no idea why he had done it ; whether to help me , confuse me , frighten me  --  I had no basis for judgment . He might be friend or enemy . Without looking away from the open side of the stall , expecting trouble to appear there in one form or another at any moment , I groped blindly behind me for the knife that I had put aside . Once more the shadows leapt , and once more they were accompanied by a soft groan , but abruptly I realized that the groan was only the threnody of the wind , which had pickedp125up outside . The cavorting shadows were the harmless work of the wind as well . Each strong gust found a way inside the tent , and as it blew through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights overhead . Those swaying bulbs briefly gave life to inert shadows . Relieved , I stopped groping for the knife and turned my attention to the corpse once again . Its eyes were open . I recoiled , then saw that they remained dead and sightless eyes , covered with a transparent , milky film that refracted the light from above and looked almost like frost . The dead man 's flesh was still slack , his mouth still set in a rigid sneer , dirt still wadded between his parted lips and caked between his teeth . His throat bore the ruinous knife wound  --  although it did not look as bad as I remembered it  --  and no breath entered or escaped him . He was most certainly not alive . Evidently the startling retraction of the eyelids was nothing more than one of those postmortem muscle spasms that often scared the bejesus out of young medical students and novice morticians . Yes . Surely . But . . . on the other hand .. . could these nerve reactions and muscle spasms be expected almost two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few hours immediately subsequent to death ? Well , all right , then maybe the eyelids had been held shut by the weight of the earth that had been packed on top of the carcass ; now that the dirt had been removed , the lids had sprung open . The dead did not come back to life . Only crazy people sincerely claimed to have seen walking corpses . I was not crazy . I was not . I stared down at the dead man , and gradually my wild breathing subsided . The rabbit-fast beat of my heart deceleratedtoo . There . That was better . I began to wonder , again , why Joel Tuck had buried the body for me and why , once having done that favor , he had not come forward to take credit for it . And why would he have done it in the first place ? Why make himself an accompliceto murder ? Unless , of course , Joel Tuck knew that I had not murdered another human being . Was it possible , perhapsp126through his third eye , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my homicidal urges ? Whatever the case , this was not the time to think about it . At any moment the security patrol might swing past Shockville and see that the lights were on . Although I was a carny now , and not the intruder I had been two nights ago , they would nevertheless want to know what I was doing in a concession I did not own and in which I did not work . If they found the grave or , worse , the body , my status as a carny would not protect me against arrest , prosecution , and lifelong imprisonment . Using both hands , I began to push the mounded earth back into the partially reopened grave . As the damp soil spilled across the dead man 's hands , one hand moved , flinging a few clods of dirt back at me , flicking it in my face , and the other hand twitched as spasmodically as a wounded crab , and the cataracted eyes blinked , and as I fell and then scrambled backward , the corpse raised its head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . This was no vision , either . This was real . I screamed . No sound escaped me . I shook my head violently from side to side in adamant denial of this impossible sight . It seemed to me that the corpse had risen only because , moments ago , I had imagined this very same macabre development , and the insane thought somehow had the terrible power to make the horror a reality , as if my imagination were a genie that had mistaken my worst fears for wishes and had granted them . And if that were the case , then I could stuff the genie of imagination right back into its lamp , unwish this monstrous apparition , and be saved . But no matter how hard I shook my head , no matter how desperately I denied what I saw before me , the corpse did not lie down and play dead again . With grub-pale hands it groped for the edges of the grave and pulled itself into a sitting position , looking straight at me , loose soil dribbling out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spiked . I had scooted along the floor until my back was against the canvas partition that separated this stall from the next . I wanted to stand up , vault across the rope in front of the stall , and get the hell out of there , but I could no more easily run than scream . The corpse grinned , and chunks of moist earth fell from itsp127open mouth , though dirt remained clotted between its teeth . The calcimine grins of fleshless skulls , the poison-wet grins of serpents , the leer of Lugosi in Dracula 's cape  --  all paled by comparison with this grotesque configuration of bloodless lips and muddy teeth . I managed to get up onto my knees . The corpse worked its tongue obscenely , pushing more damp soil from its mouth , and a weak groan , more weary than threatening , escaped it , a gaseous sound halfway between a croak and a bubbling rift . I gasped in a breath and found myself rising somewhat dreamily , as if inflated by a foul gas expelled from the corpse before me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of one eye , I next found myself in a crouch , back bent , shouldershunched , head held low , apelike . But I did not know what to do next , except that I knew I could not run . Somehow I must deal with the hateful thing , kill it again , do the job right this time , Jesus , because if I did not deal with it , then it might drag itself out of here and find the nearest other goblins and tell them what I had done to it , and then they would know that I could see through their disguises , and they would tell other goblins , and pretty soon all of their kind would know about me , and they would organize and come after me , hunt me down , because I posed a threat to them that no other human being did . I now saw , beyond the cataracts sheathing the eyes , beyond the eyes themselves , a faint red glow , the bloody light of other eyes , goblin eyes . A tiny glimmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of before . Just a distant pulsing ember in each clouded orb . I could see nothing more of the goblin , no snout or toothy muzzle , just a suggestion of those hateful eyes , perhaps because the beast was too far along the road of death to be able to project its full presence back into this human hulk . But surely even this much was impossible . Its throat had been torn open , damn it , and its heart had ceased beating back there in the Dodgem Car pavilion the night before last , and it had stopped breathing , too , for Christ 's sake , had not breathed for two whole days while buried beneath the sideshow floor  --  was still not breathing as far as I could see  --  and had lost so much blood that there could not be enough left to sustain its circulatory system . Its grin broadened as it struggled to pull itself out of thep128half-opened grave . But part of its body remained pinned beneath almost a foot and a half of earth , and it was having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and diabolic determination it continued digging and straining , all the while exhibiting the flailing , jerky movements of a broken machine . Although I had left it for dead among the Dodgem Cars , a spark of life evidently had remained within it . Somehow its kind obviously could retreat from death when an ordinary man would have no choice but surrender , retreat into a state of  --  what ?  --  maybe suspended animation , something of the sort , defensively curling up around the faintest ember of life force , jealously guarding it , keeping it aglow . And then what ? Could a nearly dead goblin gradually fan the ember of life into a small flame , rebuild the flame into a fire , repair its damaged body , reanimate itself , and come back from the grave ? If I had not disinterred this one , would its ravaged throat have healed and would it have magically replenished its blood supply ? In a couple of weeks , when the carnival was long gone and the fairgrounds were deserted , would it have reenacted a grisly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the inside ? I felt myself teetering at the brink of a psychological abyss . If I was not insane already , then I had never been closer to madness than I was now . Grunting with frustration , uncoordinated and by all appearancesnot terribly strong , the unbreathing but demonically animated cadaver began to claw at the earth that weighed down its lower body , scooping the soil aside with slow , stupid industriousness . Its opalescent eyes never drifted away from me for a moment , watching me intently from under its low , dirt-smeared brow . Not strong , no , but it was getting stronger even as I crouched there , transfixed by terror . It attacked the confining earth with increasing fervor , and the vague red glow in its eyes was growing brighter . The knife . The weapon was beside the grave . The wind-stirred light bulb swung on its cord overhead , and a bright reflection of it rippled back and forth along the steel blade that lay on the floor below , imparting a look of sorcerous power to the weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true Excalibur ; in fact , to me , at that dark moment , it was as valuable as any magic sword drawn from a scabbard of stone . But to get myp129hands on the knife , I would have to put myself within the reach of the half-dead thing . Deep in its torn throat , the corpse made a shrill , wet , cackling noise that might have been laughter  --  the laughter of asylum dwellers or of the damned . It had almost freed one leg . With sudden resolve I scuttled forward , toward the knife . The thing anticipated me , swung one clumsy arm , and swatted the weapon away from me . With a clink-tink-clink and a final glimmer-flash , the knife spun through the sawdust and vanished in the blackness under the edge of the wooden platform that supported Joel Tuck 's empty chair . I did not even consider hand-to-hand combat . I knew I had no chance of choking or hammering the life out of a zombie . It would be like fighting quicksand . Slow and weak as the creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me out , resist , until I was totally exhausted , and then finish me with . slow , heavy blows . The knife was my only chance . So I plunged past the shallow grave , and the dead thing clutched my leg with one frigid hand that instantly passed its own coldness through my jeans and into my own flesh , but I kicked at it , driving one boot into the side of its head , and tore loose . Stumbling to the far corner of the twelve-foot-long stall , I half fell and half dropped to my knees , then onto my belly , at the spot where the knife had disappeared into the gap beneath- the platform . The opening was perhaps five inches high , plenty of space to slip an arm through . I reached under there , felt around , found dirt and sawdust and pebbles and an old bent nail but no knife . I heard the dead thing gabbling wordlessly behind me , dirt being flung aside , limbs pulling free of entombment , squishing , grunting , scrabbling . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the platform until the edge of a plank jammed painfully into my shoulder , and I strained to reach six inches deeper , probed , trying to see with my fingertips as well as feel , found nothing but a small bit of wood and a crisp cellophane wrapper from cigarettes or candy , so I was not getting in there deep enough , and I was tormented by the thought that my hand was unknowingly within a hair 's breadth of the desired object , and nothing for it but to squeeze in farther , just two more inches , pleasethere !  --  deeperbut still no good , no sign of the knife , so I moved to the left a little , now right , frantically graspingp130empty air and dirt and a tuft of dry grass , and now behind me came a gibbering-chuckling noise and the scrape-thud of a heavy footstep , and I was whimpering , heard myself whimperingand could not stop one more inch !  --  and under the platform something pricked my thumb , the sharp point of the knife at last , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulled it out , reversed my grip on it  --  but before I could get up or even roll onto my back , the corpse bent over me and seized me by the scruff of the neck and the seat of the pants , lifted me with more strength than I had expected of it , swung me , pitched me , and I landed hard , facedown in the grave , an earthworm against my nose , chokingon a mouthful of dirt . Gagging , swallowing some dirt , spitting some out , I flopped onto my back just as the brain-damaged goblin clumped and heaved its broken-machine body to the edge of the grave . It glared down . Eyes of frost and fire . Its inconstant shadow swung back and forth across me as the light above dipped in the draft . There was not sufficient distance between us for me to throw the knife successfully . However , suddenly sensing the dead thing 's intention , I gripped the haft with both hands , held the weapon straight up , and locked my shoulders and elbows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same instant that it spread its arms and , grinning witlessly , fell toward me . It impaled itself upon the knife , and my arms buckled under its weight . It collapsed on top of me , knocking my breath out . Though the knife was buried to the hilt in its unbeating heart , it would not yet be still . Its chin lay on my shoulder , and it pressed one cold and greasy cheek to mine . It muttered senselessly in my ear , in a tone disconcertingly like that of one in the throes of passion . Its arms and legs twitched spider-quick though without purpose , and its hands quivered and jerked . Empowered by overwhelming disgust and unadulterated terror , I pushed , squirmed , hit , kicked , bucked , shoved , twisted , clawed , and pulled my way out from under the creature , until our positions were reversed , with me atop it , one knee on its groin , the other in the dirt beside it . I sputtered curses comprisedof half words and nonwords that were every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead adversary'sstill moving lips , and I wrenched the knife out of itsp131heart and stabbed it again , again , once more , in throat and chest and belly , again , and once more . Lacking aim and enthusiasm , it swung brick-size fists at me , but even in my mindless frenzy I dodged most blows with little difficulty , though the few that landed on my arms and shoulders were effective . Eventually my knife produced the desired result , cutting out the throbbing cancer of unnatural life that animatedthe cold flesh , excising it bit by bit , until the dead thing 's spasming legs grew still , until its arms moved even more slowly and erratically , until it began to bite its own tongue . Its arms at last dropped , limp at its sides , and its mouth fell slack , and the faint crimson light of goblin intelligencewent out of its eyes . I had killed it . Again . But killing was not enough . I had to make sure the thing stayed dead . I could now see that indeed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dodgem Car pavilion . Until tonight I had not realized that goblins , like the vampires of European folklore , could sometimes resurrect themselves if they had not been dispatched with sufficient thoroughness . Now that I knew the grim truth , I would take no chances . While a flood tide of adrenaline was still sluicing through me , before I came crashing down into enervating despair and nausea , I cut off the creature 's head . It was not easy work , but my knife was sharp , the blade of tempered steel , and I still had the strength of terror and fury . At least the butchery was bloodless , for 1 had already drained this corpse two nights ago . Outside , with much moaning and hissing , hot summer wind gusted across the tent . The billowing canvas strained at the anchor ropes and pegs , crackling , thrumming , flapping , like the wings of a great , dark bird seeking flight but chained to an earthly perch . Large , blackish witch-moths darted around the swaying bulbs and added their swooping shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viewed with eyes that were focused through a lens of panic and blurred by stinging sweat , that constant phantom movement was maddening and only worsened the unsettling waves of dizziness that already swept through me . When at last I completed the decapitation , I considered putting the thing 's head between its legs , then filling thep132grave , but that seemed to be a dangerously incomplete scatteringof the remains . I could easily imagine the corpse , again interred , gradually moving its hands beneath the earth , reachingdown for its severed pate , reassembling itself , its torn neck knitting up , the pieces of its broken spine fusing together , crimson light returning to its strange eyes . . . . ThereforeI put the head aside and reburied only the body . I stamped on the plot , packing the dirt down as well as I could , then spread sawdust over it again . Carrying the head by its hair , feeling savage and wild and not liking that feeling one damned bit , I hurried back to the entrance to Shockville and switched off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the blustery night . I cautiously looked out at the midway where there was no movement in the waning light of the setting moon , except for the spectral shapes of gliding dust-ghosts that the seance wind had conjured up . I slipped outside , put the head down , retied the canvas at the entrance , picked the head up again , and hurried stealthily along the concourse to the back end of the lot , between two chastely darkened girlie shows , through a cluster of trucks that stood like slumbering elephants , past generators and huge , empty wooden grates , across a deserted field , into the nearest arm of the forest that embraced three sides of the fairgrounds . With each step I was increasingly afraid that the head , dangling from its handle of hair , was coming alive again  --  a new glow dawning in its eyes , lips writhing , teeth gnashing  --  and I held it out to one side , at arm 's length , so I would not accidentally bump it against my leg and give it a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , it was dead , all the life gone from it forever . The grinding and clacking of its teeth , its thick mutterings of hatred and anger , were merely my own fevered fantasies . My imagination not only ran away with me but galloped , raced , stampeded across a nightmare landscape of horrendous possibilities . When at last I thrashed through the underbrush beneath the trees , found a small clearing beside a brook , and put the severed head upon a convenient rock table , even the wan and eldritch moonbeams provided adequate light to prove that my fears were groundless and that the object of my terror remained without life , natural or otherwise . The earth near the stream was a soft , moist loam , easily dug with bare hands . The trees , their night-black boughs likep133witch skirts and warlock robes , stood sentinel at the perimeterof the clearing while I scooped a hole , buried the head , tamped down the earth , and concealed my labors with a scattering of dead leaves and pine needles . Now , to effect a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear out of its pit in the midway , crawl or stagger sightlessly to the forest , locate this clearing , and exhume its own head from this second grave . Although the events of the past hour had instilled in me an even greater respect for the evil powers of the goblin race , I was quite certain that they could not overcome such formidable obstaclesto resurrection as these . The beast was dead , and it would remain dead . The trip from the sideshow to the forest , the digging of the hole , and the burial of the head had all been accomplished in a near panic . So I stood in the clearing for a moment , arms hanging limply , and tried to calm down . It was not easy . I kept thinking about Uncle Denton , back in Oregon . Had his badly hacked corpse healed in the privacy of his coffin and had he smashed his way out of the tomb a few weeks after I had gone on the run from the law ? Had he paid a visit to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take vengeance on the Stanfeuss family , and had they become a goblin 's victims because of me ? No . That was unthinkable . I could not live under the smothering weight of that guilt . Denton had not come back . For one thing , that bloody day I had gone after him , he had fought with such ferocity that my rage had grown into a state not unlike a psychotic frenzy , and I had inflicted horrible damage with the ax , wielding it with mad abandon even after I had known he was dead ; he had been too smashed and thoroughly dismembered to have knittedhimself together again . Furthermore , even if he achieved resurrection , surely he would not return to the Stanfeuss house or to anyplace in the Siskiyou valleys where he was known , for the miracle of his return from the grave would have shocked the world and focused relentless attention upon him . I was sure he was still in his coffin , decomposing  --  but if he was not in his grave , then he was far from Oregon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not my folks . I turned from the clearing , pressed through the brush , and found my way back to the open field where the night was redolent with the scent of goldenrod . I had covered only halfp134the distance to the midway when I realized that there was still a taste of dirt in my mouth , from the bite of earth I had unwillingly taken when thrown into the goblin 's grave . That vile taste recalled every detail of the horrors of the past hour , somehow broke through the guardian numbness that had protectedme from collapse while I had done what had to be done . Nausea overwhelmed me . I fell to my hands and knees , hung my head , and vomited in the grass and goldenrod . When the nausea passed , I crawled a few feet away and flopped onto my back , blinking at the stars , catching my breath , trying to find the strength to go on . It was four-fifty in the morning . The orange sun of dawn was no more than an hour away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joel Tuck 's forehead . Joel Tuck . . . he had spirited the body out of the Dodgem Car pavilion and had buried it , which might have been the act of someone who knew the goblins for what they were and wanted to help me . Almost certainly Joel Tuck also had been the one who had come into the trailer where I was sleeping the previous night and had left the two passes  --  one to the Dodgem Cars and one to the Ferris wheel  --  on my folded jeans . He had been trying to tell me that he knew what had happened at the Dodgem Cars and that he also knew , as I did , that something was going to happen at the Ferris wheel . He saw the goblins , and to some extent he sensed the malignant energies around the Ferris wheel , though his own psychic talent was probably not as strong as mine . This was the first time I had ever encountered anyone with any genuine psychic abilities , and it was certainly the first time I had come across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a moment I was overcome with a sense of brotherhood , a kinship so poignant and so desperately desired that it brought tears to my eyes . I was not alone . But why did Joel resort to indirection ? Why was he reluctant to let me know about the brotherhood we shared ? Obviouslyit was because he did not want me to know who he was . But why not ? Because . . . he was not a friend . It suddenly occurred to me that Joel Tuck might consider himselfneutral in the battle between mankind and the goblin race . After all , he had been treated worse by ordinary humankindthan he had by goblins , if only because he had encounters with human beings every day and with goblins only on occasion . An outcast , rejected and even reviled by society atp135large , allowed no dignity except within the sanctuary of the carnival , he might well feel that he had no reason to oppose the goblins ' war against marks . If that was the case , he had assisted me with the dead body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferris wheel solely because those goblin schemes directly affected carnies , the only people to whom he did owe allegiance in this secret war . He did not want to approach me openly because he sensed that my vendetta against the demons was not restricted by the boundariesof the carnival , and he did not want to be drawn into a wider conflict ; he was willing to fight the war only when it came to him . He had helped me once , but he would not always help me . When you came right down to it , I was still pretty much alone . The moon had set . The night was very dark . Exhausted , I got up from the grass and goldenrod andf returned to the locker room beneath the grandstand , where I scrubbed my hands , spent fifteen minutes digging the dirt out from beneath my fingernails , and showered . Then I went down to the trailer in the meadow where I had been assigned quarters . My roommate , Barney Quadlow , was snoring loudly . I undressed and got into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort I had taken  --  and given  --  with Rya Raines was only a dim memory , though we had been together less than two hours ago ; the recent horror was more vivid , and like a newer coat of paint it overlaid the joy that had been . Now , of my time with Rya , I more clearly recalled her moodiness , her deep and inexplicable sadness , because I knew that Rya would sooner or later be the cause of another crisis with which I would have to deal . So much on my shoulders . Too much . I was only seventeen . I wept quietly for Oregon , for lost sisters and a mother 's love too far removed . I longed for sleep . I desperately needed to get some rest . Yontsdown was less than two days away.  |p136At  eight-thirty Saturday morning , after little more than two hours of sleep , I woke from a nightmare unlike any that I had ever known before . In the dream I was in a vast graveyard that sloped down a long and apparently endless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marble monuments of all sizes and shapes , some cracked and many canted , in rows without end , in numbers beyond counting , the very cemetery of Rya 's own dreams . Rya was there , too , running away from me , through the snow , under the black branches of barren trees . I was chasing her , and the weird thing was that I felt both love and loathing for her , and I did not know exactly what I was going to do when I caught her . A part of me wanted to cover her face with kisses and make love to her , but another part of me wanted to throttle her until her eyes bulged and her face turned black and her lovely blue eyes clouded with death . This savage fury , directed toward someone I loved , scared the hell out of me , and more than once I stopped . But each time that I halted , she halted , too , waiting for me among the tombstones on the slope below , as if she wanted me to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a lover 's game , that something was wrong with me , that I might lose control of myself when I caught her , but I could not will my lips andp137tongue to form the words . Each time I stopped , she waved me on , and I found myself pursuing her once more . And then I knew what must be wrong with me . There must be a goblin in me ! One of the demonkind had entered me , had taken control of me , destroying my mind and soul , leaving nothing but my flesh , which was now its flesh , but Rya was not aware of this ; she still saw only Slim , just her loving Slim MacKenzie ; she did not realize what terrible danger she was in , did not understand that Slim was dead and gone , that his living body served an unhuman creature now , and if that creature caught her , it would choke the life out of her , and now it was gaining on her , and she glanced back at it-me , laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now it-me was within ten feet of her , eight , six , four , and then I grabbed hold of her , swung her around -- and when I awoke , I could still feel her throat collapsing in my iron hands . I sat straight up in bed , listening to the furious beat of my heart and to my ragged breathing , trying to clear my mind of the nightmare . I blinked in the morning light and desperately tried to assure myself that , as vivid and powerful as the scene had been , nevertheless it had been only a dream , not a premonition of things to come . Not a premonition . Please . The show call was for eleven o'clock , which left me with a couple of hours on my hands , hours in which I might wind up contemplating the blood that was also on my hands if I did not , for God 's sake , find something to occupy myself . The fairgrounds were on the edge of the county seat , a burg of about seven or eight thousand souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coffee shop , then went next door to a men 's store and bought two pair of jeans and a couple of shirts . I saw no goblins during the entire visit , and the day was so August-perfect that I gradually began to feel that everything might turn out all right  --  me and Rya , the week in Yontsdown  --  if I just kept my wits about me and did not lose hope . I returned to the fairgrounds at ten-thirty , put the newp138jeans and shirts in the trailer , and was on the midway by a quarter of eleven . I had the high-striker ready for business before show call and had just sat down on the stool beside it to await the first marks when Rya appeared . Golden girl . Bare , tanned legs . Yellow shorts . Four differentshades of yellow in a horizontally striped T-shirt . She was wearing a bra on the midway because this was 1963 , and bralessness in public would have been shocking to the marks , regardless of how acceptable it was in the trailer town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face with a knotted yellow bandanna . Radiant . I stood , attempted to put my hands on her shoulders , tried to kiss her cheek , but she put one hand against my chest , restraining me , and said , " I do n't want any misunderstanding . " " About what ? " " Last night . " " What could I possibly misunderstand about that ? " " What it means . " " What does it mean ? " She was frowning . " It means I like you  --  " " Good ! " "  --  and it means we can give each other pleasure  --  " " You noticed ! " "  --  but it does n't mean I 'm your girl or anything like that . " " You sure look like a girl to me , " I said . " On the midway I 'm still your boss . " " Ah . " " And you 're the employee . " " Ah , " I said . Jesus , 1 thought . She said , " And I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midway . " " God forbid . But we do still get to be unusually familiar off the midway ? " She was utterly unaware of the offensiveness of her approachand tone , and did not understand the humiliation that her words inflicted ; therefore , she was not sure what my flippancy indicated , but she risked a smile . She said , " That 's right . Off the midway I expect you to be just as unusually familiar as you want . " " Sounds as if I 've got two jobs , the way you put it . Didp139you hire me for my talent as a pitchman  --  or for my body too ? " Her smile faltered . " For your pitch , of course . " " Because , boss , I would n't want to think you 're taking advantage of this poor , lowly hired man . " " I 'm serious , Slim . " " I noticed . " " So why are you making jokes ? " " It 's a socially acceptable alternative . " " Huh ? To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You 're mad at me . " " Ah , you 're as perceptive as you are beautiful , boss . " " There 's no reason for you to get angry . " " No . I guess I 'm just a hothead . " " I 'm only trying to get things straight between us . " " Very businesslike . I admire that . " " Look , Slim , all I 'm saying is that whatever happens between us in private is one thing  --  and what happens here on the midway is another . " " Good heavens , I would never suggest we do it right here on the midway , " I said . " You 're being difficult . " " You , on the other hand , are a paragon of diplomacy . " " See , some guys , if they got in the boss 's pants , they'dfigure they did n't have to pull their share of the load at workany more . " Do I seem like that kind of guy ? " I asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly sound like a vote of confidence . " " I do n't want you to be angry with me , " she said . " I 'm not , " I said , although I was . I knew that she had difficulty relating to people on a one-to-one basis . Because of my psychic perception I had a special appreciation for the sadness , loneliness , and uncertainty  --  andresultant defiant bravura  --  that shaped her character , and I was as sorry for her as I was angry . " You are , " she said . " You 're angry . " " It 's all right , " I said . " Now I got to get to work . " I pointed to the far end of the concourse . " Here come the marks . " " Are . we straight ? " she asked . " Yeah . "  | " Sure ? " " Yeah . " " See you later , " she said . I watched her walk away , and I loved her and hated her , but mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no point in being angry with her ; she was an inevitable , elemental force ; it made as much sense to be angry with the wind or the winter cold or the summer heat , for neither they nor she could be changed by anger . At one o'clock Marco relieved me for thirty minutes , then for a three-hour break starting at five . Both times I thought about paying a visit to Shockville and having a word with the enigmatic Joel Tuck , and both times I decided against rash action . This was the biggest day of the engagement , and the crowd was three or four times as large as it had been during the week , and what I had to say to Joel was nothing that could be said in front of marks . Besides , I was afraid  --  in fact , certain  --  that he would clam up if I pressed him too hard or fast . He might deny any knowledge of goblins and secret burials in the dead of night , and then I would not know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the freak  --  ally and friend and , strangely , father figure  --  and I was concerned that a premature confrontation would drive him away from me . I sensed that it was wiser to let him get to know me better , give him more time to make up his mind about me . I was probably the first person he had ever met who could see the goblins that he saw , just as he was the first I had ever met with that same thankless ability , so sooner or later his curiosity would overcome his reticence . Until then I would have to be patient . Therefore , after a bite of supper , I went down to the meadow , to the trailer where I had my room , and sacked out for two hours . This time there were no nightmares . I was too tired to dream . I was back at the high-striker before eight o'clock . The last five hours of the engagement passed quickly and profitably in a dry rain of many-colored light that splashed and drizzled over everything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peals of brassy laughter . Pointing ,  |p141chattering  , gaping marks surged past the high-striker , like water overflowing gutters , and in that flood was a swept-along litter of paper money and coins , some of which I strained out and kept for Rya Raines . Finally , by one o'clock in the morning , the midway began to shut down . To carnies the last night of a stand is " slough night , " and they look forward to it because there is an irrepressible Gypsy spirit in all of them . The carnival sheds the town much like a snake sloughs off its old skin , and as the snake is renewed by the mere act of change , so is the carny and carnival reborn through the promise of new places and new pockets to be relieved of new money . Marco came around to collect the day 's take so I could start dismantling the high-striker without delay . While I attended to that job , a few hundred other carnies  --  concessionaires , jointees , jam auctioneers , animal trainers , stunt acts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short-order cooks , roughies , everyone but the ' children ( who were in bed ) and those watching over the children  --  were at work , too , tearing down and packing the rides and hanky-panks and sideshows and grab-stands and other joints , illuminated by the giant generator-powered midway lights . The small roller coaster , a rarity in traveling carnivals , constructed entirely of steel pipes , came apart with a ceaseless clank-pong-clink-spang ! that was initially irritating but that soon seemed like a strange atonal music , not entirely unpleasant , and eventually became such a part of the background noise that it ceased to be noticeable . At the funhouse the clown 's face fractured and came down in four parts , the fourth being the huge yellow nose , which hung for a while alone in the night as if it were the proboscis of a gargantuan , mocking Cheshire cat , as given to bizarre vanishingacts as its cousin who had taunted Alice . Something of dinosaurian proportions , with an appetite to match , had taken a bite out of the Ferris wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisted forms and faces of the human oddities ; as those billowing and curling banners slid down their mooring poles with a creak of pulley wheels , the painted two-dimensional portraits acquired the illusion of three-dimensional life , **43;15038;TOOLONG the laboring carnies below , then folding up with a kiss of canvas lips to painted foreheads , their depthless eyes now contemplating nothing more than their own noses , two-dimensional reality swiftly replacing the briefp142imitation of life . Two bites were gone from the Ferris wheel . When I finished at the high-striker , I helped pack up Rya Raines 's other concessions , then moved around the collapsing midway , pitching in wherever I was needed . We unbolted wooden wall panels , folded tents into parachute bundles for the drop to Yontsdown , disassembled beams and braces , told jokes as we worked , skinned knuckles , strained muscles , cut fingers , nailed shut the lids of crates , hefted crates into trucks , tore up the plank floor of the Dodgem Car pavilion , grunted , sweated , cursed , laughed , guzzled soda , poured down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the larger beams to the trucks , sang a few songs ( including some that had been written by Buddy Holly , already dead four and a half years , his body compacted with that of a Beechcraft Bonanza on the lonely frozen field of a farm between Clear Lake , Iowa , and Fargo , North Dakota ) , and we unscrewed screws , unnailed nails , untied ropes , coiled up a few miles of electric cables , and the next time I looked toward the Ferris wheel , I discovered that it had been eaten up entirely , not even one small bone remaining . Rudy " Red " Morton , the Sombra Brothers ' chief mechanic , whom I had met at the Whip that first morning on the lot , directed a platoon of men , and he was in turn guided by Gordon Alwein , who was our bald and bearded superintendent of transportation . Gordy was responsible for the final loading of the enormous midway , and since Sombra Brothers traveled in forty-six railroad cars and ninety huge trucks , his job was very demanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many flames , was extinguished . Weary , but with an enormously pleasant feeling of communityspirit , I returned to the trailer town in the meadow . Many had already left for Yontsdown ; others would not leave until tomorrow . I did not go to my own trailer . I went , instead , to Rya 's Airstream . She was waiting for me . " I hoped you 'd come , " she said . " You knew I would . " " I wanted to say  --  " " Not necessary . " "  --  I 'm sorry . "  | " I 'm dirty . " " Want to shower ? " I wanted , and I did . She had a beer waiting for me when I dried off . In her bed , where I thought I would be capable of nothing but sleep , we made a most deliciously slow and easy love , all sighs and murmurs in the darkness , soft caresses , a dreamy slow-motion pumping of hips , the whisper of skin against skin , her breath like sweet summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down into some shadowy but not at all threatening place , melding as We glided , joining more completelywith each additional second of descent , and I felt that we were moving toward a perfect and permanent union , that we were close to becoming one entity with an identity different from either of our own , which was a state I much desired , a way to surrender all the bad memories and the responsibilitiesand the aching loss of Oregon . Just such a blissful relinquishing of self seemed within reach if only I could synchronize the rhythm of intercourse with the beat of her heart , and then , a moment later , that synchronization was achieved , and through the medium of my sperm I passed my own heartbeat into her , the two now thumping as one , and with a lovely shudder and a fading sigh I ceased to exist . I dreamed of the graveyard . Time-rotted sandstone slabs . Chipped marble monuments . Weathered granite obelisks and rectangles and globes on which perched blackbirds with wickedly hooked bills . Rya was running . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not want to kill her , but for some reason I did not understand , I had no choice other than to bring her down and tear the life out of her . She left not merely footprints in the snow but footprints filled with blood . She was not injured , was not bleeding , so I supposed the blood was merely a sign , an omen of the slaughter to come , proof of the inevitability of our roles , victim and murderer , prey and hunter . I closed on her , and her hair streamed behind her in the wind , and I grabbed it , and her feet skidded out from under her , and we both fell among the headstones , and then I was atop her , snarling , going for her throat , as if I were an animal instead of a man , teeth snapping , seeking her jugular , and blood spurted , quick warm jets of thick crimson serumI woke . Sat up.  |p144Tasted  blood . Shook my head , blinked my eyes , came fully awake . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be imagination . A lingering bit of the dream . But it would not go away . I fumbled for the bedside lamp , snapped it on , and the light seemed harsh and accusing . Shadows fled to the corners of the small room . I brought a hand to my mouth . Pressed trembling fingers to my lips . Looked at my fingers . Saw blood . Beside me , Rya was a huddled form under a single sheet , like a body discreetly covered by thoughtful policemen at the scene of a homicide . She was half turned away from me . All I could see of her was bright hair upon her pillow . She did not move . If she was breathing , she was inhaling and exhalingso shallowly that it was not detectable . I swallowed hard . That blood taste . Coppery . Like sucking on an old penny . No . I had not actually torn her throat out while I dreamed . Oh , God . Impossible . I was not a madman . I was not a homicidal maniac . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of my desperate denials , a wild and swooping terror , like a frantic bird , flapped crazily within me , and I could not find the nerve to pull back the sheet and look at Rya . I leaned against the headboard and put my face in my hands . In the past few hours I had obtained the first hard evidence that the goblins were real rather than chimeras of my dementedimagination . In my heart I had always known that they were real , that I was not killing innocent people under the mad misapprehension that a goblin hid within them . Yet ... what I knew in my heart had never been proof against doubt , and fears of madness had long assailed me . Now I knew that Joel Tuck saw the demonkind too . And I had battled a corpse that had been reanimated by a tiny spark of goblin life force , and if it had been the corpse of an ordinary man , an innocent victim of my mania , it never could have come back as it had done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insanity that I had often leveled against myself . Nevertheless I sat with face in hands , making a mask of myp145palms and fingers , reluctant to reach out and touch her , afraid of what I might have done . I gagged on the taste of blood . I shuddered and took a deep breath , and with the breath came the scent of blood . For the past couple of years , I had suffered grim , dark moments during which I was overcome with the impression that the world was nothing but a charnel house , created and set spinning in the void for the sole purpose of providing a stage for a cosmic Grand Guignol play  --  and this was one of those moments . In the grip of this depression , it always seemed to me that mankind was made only for slaughter , that we either killed one another , fell prey to the goblins , or became victims of those whims of fate  --  cancer , earthquakes , tidal waves , brain tumors , lightning bolts  --  that were God 's colorful contributions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defined and circumscribed by blood . But I had always been able to pull myself out of these pits by clinging to the belief that my crusade against the goblins would ultimatelysave lives and that I would one day discover a way to convince other men and women of the existence of the monstersthat walked among us in disguise . Then , in my scenario of hope , men would stop fighting and hurting one another and would turn all their attention to the real war . But if I had attacked Rya in a delirium and had torn the life out of her , if I could kill someone I loved , then I was insane , and any hope for myself or the future of my kind was a pathetic -- then Rya whimpered in her sleep . I gasped . She thrashed in response to something in a nightmare of her own , tossed her head , wrestled with the sheet a moment , until her face and throat were exposed , then subsided into a less active but still unquiet sleep . Her face was as lovely as my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though her brow was creased and her mouth was pulled into a teeth-baring grimace by the anxiety that was part of her bad dream . Her throat was unmarked . No blood was visible . I was weak with relief , and I thanked God effusively . My usual scorn for His works was temporarily forgotten . Naked , confused , and afraid , I got silently out of bed , went to the bathroom , closed the door , and turned on the light . I looked first at my hand , which I had touched to my lips , and the blood was still on my fingers . Then I raised my eyes top146the mirror , and I saw the blood on my chin , glistening on my lips , coating my teeth . I washed my hands , scrubbed my face , rinsed out my mouth , found some Lavoris in the medicine cabinet , and got rid of the coppery taste . I thought I had probably bitten my tongue in my sleep , but the mouthwash did not sting , and on careful examination I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . Somehow the blood in the dream had acquired actual , substanceand had come with me when I awakened , out of the land of nightmare into the real world of the living . Which was not possible . I looked at the reflection of my Twilight Eyes . " What does it mean ? " I asked myself . The mirror image made no answer . " What exactly the hell is coming ? " I demanded . My looking-glass companion either knew nothing or held his secrets behind compressed lips . I returned to the bedroom . Rya had not escaped her nightmare . She lay half revealed , half concealed , in a drift of white linen , and her legs scissoredas if she were running , and she said , " Please , please , " and she said , " Oh ! " and she seized fistsful of sheets , tossing her head for a moment , then passing into a more docile state in which she resisted the dream with only muttered words and occasional faint cries . I got into bed . Doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are of surprisingly short duration . Regardless of how long a nightmare seems to last , the researchers report , it actually plays through from beginning to end in no more than a few minutes , usually only twenty to sixty seconds . ObviouslyRya Raines had not read what the experts had to say , for she spent the last half of the night proving them wrong . Her sleep was tortured by a series of phantom enemies , imagined battles , and dream pursuits . I watched her for half an hour in the amber glow of the bedside lamp . Then I switched out the lamp and sat in darkness for another half hour , listening to her , realizing that sleep was the same imperfect rest to her that it was to me . In time I stretched out on my back , and through the mattress I could feel each twitch and spasm of terror that she transmitted from the realm of dreams.  |p147I  wondered if she was in one of her graveyards . I wondered if it was the graveyard on the hill . I wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it was me.  |p148From  the flung-wide doors of trucks , from the popped-open lids of crates , like a marvelous spring-loaded mechanism constructed by the same clever Swiss artisans who are famous for their immensely complicated town-hall clocks with lifesizemoving figures , the carnival rebuilt itself upon the midwayat the Yontsdown County Fairgrounds . By seven o'clock Sunday evening it was as if slough night had never been , as if we remained all season in one place , while one town after another came to us . Carries say they love to travel , and carnies say they could not live without at least a weekly change of venue , and carnies espouse  --  hell , they champion  --  the philosophy of **25;15083;TOOLONG , and carnies are sentimental suckers for tales and legends of lives lived on the sometimes perilous borders of society , but wherever they go , carnies carry their village in their luggage . Their trucks , trailers , cars , baggage , and pockets are stuffed full of the comfortable familiarities of their lives , and their respect for tradition is far greater than what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unchanging , generation after generation  --  against the intimidatingly empty vastnessof the plains . Carnies look forward to slough night because it is a statement of their freedom , in contrast to the imprisonment of the dreary marks who must always remainp149behind . But after one day on the road , carnies are edgy and insecure , for although the romance of the road belongs to the Gypsy spirit , the road itself is the work and the property of straight society , and rovers can go only where society has provided passage . In unconscious awareness of the vulnerabilitythat attends mobility , carnies greet their arrival at each new engagement with even more pleasure than they find in the orderly destruction of slough night . The carnival is always reassembled much faster than it is disassembled , and no night of the week is half as sweet as that first night on a new lot when , simultaneously , wanderlust has been satisfied for anothersix days and a sense of community has been reestablished . Once they have erected the tents and hammered together the enameled wooden partitions of the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chrome and plastic and light-strung fortifications of fantasy to protect against all attacks of reality , they know a deeper peace than at any other time . Sunday evening , in the trailer owned by Irma and Paulie Lorus where Rya and I had been invited for a home-cooked meal , everyone was in such good humor that I was almost able to forget that our schedule had brought us not to any ordinary town but to a city ruled by goblins , to a nest where the demons bred . Paulie , who was short but not a dwarf like his raven-haired wife , was a gifted mimic who treated us to wildly comic impersonations of movie stars and politicians , including a highly amusing dialogue between John Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev . He was a black man , and it was amazing how his rubbery face could reshape itself and instantlycall to mind almost any famous person he wished to be , regardless of race . Paulie was a good sleight-of-hand magician , too , and worked in Tom Catshank 's sideshow . For a man of his stature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with long , thin fingers , and his conversation was punctuated with an amazing array of gestures that were nearly as expressive as words . I liked him at once . Rya defrosted a bit , even joined in with some of the joking , and although she did not entirely drop the cool pose and distant air that were her trademarks ( after all , this was the home of an employee ) , she was certainly no drag on the evening.  |p150Then  , at the built-in dining nook , over Black Forest cake and coffee , Irma said , " Poor Gloria Neames . " Rya said , " Why ? What happened ? " Irma looked at me . " You know her , Slim ? " " The . . . heavy lady , " I said . " Fat , " Paulie said , hands defining a sphere in the air . " Gloria ai n't insulted to be called fat . She do n't like being fat , poor kid , but she has no illusions about what she is . She do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , she ca n't help what she is , so there 's no point being defensive about it , " Irma said . She looked at me . " Bad glands . " I said , " Really ? " " Oh , I know , " Irma said , " you figure she eats like a pig and blames it on bad glands , but in Gloria 's case it 's true . Peg Seeton lives with Gloria , you know , sort of takes care of her , cooks her meals , calls for a couple of roughies whenever Gloria needs to get around , and Peg says poor Gloria eats hardly any more than you or me , certainly not enough to sustain seven hundred and fifty pounds . And Peg would know if Gloria was snacking on the sly because Peg has to go out to buy groceries , and there is n't much of anywhere Gloria goes without Peg . " " She ca n't walk by herself ? " I asked . " She can , sure , " Paulie said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's deathly afraid of falling down . Anybody would be , once they go past five or six hundred pounds . Gloria goes down , she ca n't get up by herself . " " In fact , " Irma said , " she just about ca n't get up at all . Oh , yeah , from a chair she can pull herself up , but not if she drops to the floor or falls flat on her back on the ground . Last time she fell , no number of roughies could get her up again . " " Seven hundred and fifty pounds is a lot to heave , " Paulie said , his hands dropping abruptly to the booth on either side of him as if forced down by sudden weight . " She 's too well padded to break any bones , but the humiliation is terrible , even when it 's just among us , her own kind . " " Terrible , " Irma agreed , shaking her head sadly . Rya said , " Last time they finally had to bring a truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even then it was n't easy getting her upright and keeping her there . " " Might sound funny , but it was n't funny at all , " Irma assured me.  | " You do n't see me smiling , " I said , appalled by this glimpse of what the fat woman had to endure . To my mental list of japes that God makes at our expense , I added another item : cancer , earthquakes , tidal waves , brain tumors , lightning bolts . . . bad glands . " But none of this is news , " Rya said , " except maybe to Slim , so why did you say Poor Gloria ' and get us started on her ? " " She 's real upset tonight , " Irma said . " She got a speeding ticket , " Paulie said . " That 's hardly a major tragedy , " Rya said . " It ai n't the ticket that 's upset her , " Paulie said . " It was the way the cop treated her , " Irma said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this customized Cadillac specially adapted for her . More steel in the frame . Backseats have been taken out and then the front seat pushed more toward the rear . Hand brakes , hand accelerator . Wider doors so she can get in and out easy enough . She 's got herself the finest car radio you can get and even a little refrigerator in under the dash so she can carry cold drinks with her , a propane stove , and toilet facilities  --  all right there in the car . She loves that car . " " Sounds expensive , " I said . " Well , yeah , but Gloria is well-to-do , " Paulie said . " You got to realize , in a good week , in a big engagement , like that county fair in New York State the end of this month , you 'll get maybe seven or eight hundred thousand paid admissions to the midway in just six days , and out of those . . . maybe a hundred and fifty thousand marks will also pay to go through Shockville . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a head  --  " " Three hundred thousand for the week , " Rya said , picking up the pot and pouring more coffee for herself . " Joel Tuck splits the take , half for him  --  out of which he pays a hefty concession fee to Sombra Brothers and all overhead  --  the other half to be divided among his other eleven attractions . " " Which means over thirteen thousand for Gloria in just that one week , " Paulie said , his expressive hands counting invisible sheafs of dollar bills , " which is enough to buy two customized Cadillacs . Not every week 's so good , of course . Some weeks she does only two thousand , but she probably averages around five thousand a week from mid-April through mid-October . " Irma said , " The important thing is n't how much the Cadil/lac cost Gloria , it 's how much freedom it gives her . See , the only time she 's mobile at all is when she 's settled in that car . After all , she 's a carny , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mobile . " " No , " Rya said , " the important thing is n't the freedom the car gives her . The important thing is this story about the speeding ticket , if you 're ever going to get around to it . " " Well , " Irma said , " Gloria drove in this morning , see , while Peg brought their pickup and trailer , and Gloria was n't half a mile past the county line when a sheriff 's deputy stopped her for speeding . Now , Gloria 's been driving twentytwoyears and never had an accident or a ticket . " Paulie made an emphatic gesture with one hand and said , " She 's a good driver , a careful driver , ' cause she knows what a disaster it 'd be if she had an accident in that car . The ambulance attendants would never get her out . So she 's carefuland she do n't speed . " " So when this Yontsdown County Sheriff 's deputy pulls her over , " Irma continued , " she figures it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bilk strangers , and when it seems to be a trap , she tells the fuzz that she 'll pay the fine . But that 's not good enough for him . He gets abusive with her , insults her , and he wants her to get out of the car , but she 's afraid she 'll fall down , so then he insists she drive to the sheriff 's office in downtown Yontsdown , with him following her , and once they get there he makes her get out of her car , takes her inside , and they start putting her through hell , threatening to book her for disobeying an officer of the law or some bullshit like that . " Finishing his cake , gesturing with a fork now , Paulie said , " They make poor Gloria traipse back and forth from one end of the county building to the other , and they do n't give her a chance to sit down , so she 's kind of holding on to the wall and holding on to counters and railings and desks and anythingshe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was pretty clear they wanted her to fall down because they knew what a nightmare it 'd be for her to get on her feet again . They was all laughing at her . They would n't let her go to the bathroom , either ; said she 'd break the commode . As you can figure , her heart ai n't none too good , and she said it was beating so hard , it shook her . They had poor Gloria reduced to tears by the time she was allowed a phone call , and believe me , she 's not a self-pitying type or quick to cry . "  | " Then , " Irma said , " she calls the fairgrounds office , and they call Jelly to the phone , and he goes into town and rescues her , but by then she 's been at the county building three hours ! " Rya said , " I 've always thought Jelly was a good patch . How could he let this kind of thing happen ? " I told them a little bit about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his job real well . Everyone got into the trough . This woman , Mary Vanaletto , from the county council , was the bagman for all the county payoffs . Jelly gave her cash and free passes for all the councilmen and the sheriff and his people . " " So maybe she pocketed the whole shmeer for herself and told the others that we would n't pay up this year , " Rya said , " and now we 're in trouble with the sheriff 's department . " I do n't think so , " I said . " I think . . . for some reason ... they 're spoiling for a fight .... " " Why ? " Rya asked . " Well , I do n't know . . . but that 's the feeling I got on Friday , " I said evasively . Irma nodded , and Paulie said , " Jelly 's already spreading the word . We got to be on our very , very best behavior this week , ' cause he thinks they 're going to look for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strong-arm us to make us come through with more sugar . " I knew that it was not our money they wanted ; they were after our blood and pain . But I could not tell Irma , Paulie , and Rya about the goblins . Even carries , the most tolerant people in the world , would find my tales not merely eccentric but insane . And although carries honor eccentricity , they are no more enamored of homicidal psychopaths than is the straight world . I offered no more than innocuous comments about the possible showdown with Yontsdown officials , keepingthe dark truth to myself . However , I knew the harassment of Gloria Neames was only the first shot of the war . Worse lay ahead of us . Worse than being shut down by the cops . Worse than any of my new friends could imagine . From that moment it was no longer possible to put the goblins out of my mind , and the rest of the evening was not as much fun as the earlier part of it had been . I smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the conversation , but a man standing in the middle of a viper 's nest is not likely to be at ease.  |p154We  left the Lorus 's trailer shortly after eleven o'clock , and Rya said , " Sleepy ? " " No . " " Me , either . " " Want to walk ? " I asked . " No . There 's something else I like to do . " " Oh , yes , " I said . " I like to do it too . " " Not that , " she said , laughing softly . " Oh . " " Not yet . " " That sounds more promising . " She ied me up to the midway . Earlier in the day solid shutters of steel-gray clouds had rolled across the sky , and they were still in place . The moon and stars were lost beyond the barrier . The carnival was a construct of shadows : pillars and slabs of darkness ; sloping roofs of blackness ; curtains of shade hung on rods of shadow over inky apertures , overlapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coal , sloe , soot , sulfur-black , anilineblack , alizarin-cyanine , japan , charcoal , carbon , raven , sable ; dark doors in darker walls . We followed the concourse until Rya stopped by the Ferris wheel . It was visible only as a series of connected , geometric , black forms against the slightly less black , moonless sky . I could feel the bad psychic vibrations pouring from the giant wheel . As on Wednesday night at the other fairground , I received no detailed images , no outline of the specific tragedy that would take place here . However , as before , I was acutely aware that future doom was stored in this machine the same way electricity collected in the cells of a battery . To my surprise Rya opened the gate in the iron-pipe fence and walked to the Ferris wheel . She glanced back and said , " Come on . " " Where ? " " Up . " " There ? " " Yes . " " How ? " " They say we 're descended from monkeys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'm descended from . . . groundhogs . " " You 'll like it . " " Too dangerous . " " Real easy , " she said , grabbing hold of the wheel and starting to climb . I watched her , a big kid on an adult 's version of a jungle gym , and I was not happy . I recalled the vision of Rya clothed in blood . I was sure that the prospect of her death was not actually at hand ; the night felt safe , though not safe enough to slow my racing heart . " Come back , " I said . " Do n't . " She paused , fifteen feet off the ground , and looked down at me , her face obscure . " Come on . " " This is crazy . " " You 'll love it . " " But  --  " " Please , Slim . " " Jesus . " " Do n't disappoint me , " she said , then turned away from me and continued to climb . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger to us tonight . The threat from the big machine still lay a few days in the future ; for now it was only wood and steel and hundreds of unlit lights . Reluctantly I ascended , discovering that the multitude of braces and struts provided more handholds and niches for the feet than I had expected . The wheel was locked , unmoving , except for some of the two-seat baskets , which swung gently when the breeze picked up or when our exertions were transmitted through the framework , into the sockets , from which the seats were suspended on thick steel pins . In spite of what I had said about being descended from groundhogs , I swiftly proved that my ancestors were apes . Thankfully Rya did not climb to the topmost basket but stopped two short of it . She was sitting there , with the safety bar flung open to allow me to enter , grinning at me in the darkness , when I arrived in a sweat and a tremble . I swung off the frame and into the metal seat beside her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elicit that rare smile . The act of swinging into the basket made it rock on its pins , and for a heart-halting moment I thought I was going top156pitch outward , slam down across the frozen waterfall of metal and wood , careening off each basket below , until I hit the ground with bone-splintering force . But I clutched the ornamentalside of the basket with one hand , gripped the scallopedback of the seat with the other hand , and rode it out . With a confidence that I found foolhardy , Rya held on with just one hand and , while the rocking was at its worst , leaned out , groped for the unsprung safety bar , seized it , pulled it back , snapped it into its latch with a clang and rattle . " There , " she said . " Cozy and snug . " And she cuddled up next to me . " I told you it would be nice . Nothing 's nicer than a ride on the dark Ferris wheel with the motor stopped and everything black and silent . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Alone ? " " Yes . " For long minutes we said nothing more , just sat close and swung gently on creaking hinges , surveying the sunless world from our dark throne . When we did speak , it was of things that had never been a part of our prior conversations  --  books , poetry , movies , favorite flowers , music  --  and I realized how somber our talk had often been before . It was as if Rya had left some nameless weight behind in order to be able to make the ascent , and now an unchained Rya came forth , possessed of an unexpected lightness of humor and a heretofore unheard girlish giggle . This was one of the few times since I had met Rya Raines that I did not sense the mysterious sadness in her . But then , after a while , I did sense it , though I can not pinpoint the moment when that livid tide of melancholy began to flow back into her . Among other things we spoke of Buddy Holly , whose songs we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in a series of laughable duets we made an a cappella mess of our favorite parts of his tunes . Holly 's untimely death surely passed through both our minds and might have been the first step down the cellar stairs toward the gloom in which she usually dwelt , because a short while later we were talking about James Dean , dead more than seven years , his life traded in with his automobile on some lonely California highway . Then Rya began to chew at the injustice of dying young , chewed and gnawed and worried it relentlessly , which was when I think I first sensed the sadness returning to her . I tried to redirect the dialogue , but Ip157had little success , for she suddenly seemed not only fascinated by morbid subjects but strangely pleased by them as well . At last , all the fun gone from her voice , she drew back from me and said , " What was it like for you last October ? How did you feel ? " For a moment I did not understand what she meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blockade , the missiles , the showdown . We were on the brink , they said . Nuclear war . Armageddon . How did you feel ? " That October had been a turning point for me and , I suspect , for all of us who had been old enough to know what the crisis had meant . For me , it brought home the fact that mankind was now capable of erasing itself from the face of the earth . And I began to understand that the goblins  --  which even then I had been observing for a few years  --  must be delighted with the spiraling technological sophistication and complexity of our society , for it provided them with increasinglyspectacular ways to torture humanity . What would happen if a goblin rose to a position of political power sufficient to give him control of The Button in either the U.S. or the Soviet Union ? Certainly they would realize that their species would be eliminated along with our own ; apocalypse would deny them the pleasure of slowly torturing us , which they appeared to enjoy so much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the silos . But , oh , how rich a feast of suffering there would be in those last days and hours ! The city-leveling blasts , the firestorms , the rains of radioactive debris : If the goblins hated us as intensely and maniacally as I perceived they did , then this was the scenario they would eventually desire , regardless of its implications for their own survival . Because of the Cuban crisis I began to realize that I would be forced to take action against the goblins sooner or later , no matter how pathetically inadequate my one-man war might be . The crisis . The turning point . In August of 1962 , the Soviet Union had begun secretly to install an extensive battery of nuclear missiles in Cuba , with the intention of achievingthe capability of launching a surprise first strike on the United States . On October 22 , after having demanded that the Russians dismantle these provocative launch facilities , after being rebuffed , and after obtaining additional evidence that showed a frantic acceleration of the project , President Ken/nedy ordered a blockade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to force its way across the quarantine line . Then , on Saturday , October 27 , one of our U-2 planes was shot down by a Soviet surface-to-air missile , and a U.S. invasion of Cuba was set ( we learned later ) for Monday , October 29 . World War III seemed only hours away . However , the Soviets backed down . During the week of the blockade the average American school-age child went through several air raid drills ; most major cities had practice air raids in which their entire populations participated ; sales of bomb shelters rocketed ; existing shelters were stocked with additionalsupplies ; all the armed services were put on alert ; units of the National Guard were moved to active status and placed at the president 's disposal ; churches held special services and reported dramatic increases in attendance . And if the goblins had not yet contemplated bringing about the total destruction of civilization , they surely must have begun to think about it during the Cuban crisis , for in those days they had fed on a rich brew of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a holocaust . " How did you feel ? " Rya asked again as we sat on the unmoving Ferris wheel above the unlit carnival in an as yet undevastated world . It would be a few days before I would understand the significance of our conversation . That night it seemed we had arrived at this morbid topic sheerly by chance . Even with my psychic perceptions I was unable to see just how deeply this subject affected her  --  and why . How did you feel ? " Scared , " I said . " Where were you that week ? " " Oregon . In high school . " " Did you think it was going to happen ? " " I do n't know . " " Did you think you were going to die ? " " We were n't exactly in a target zone . " " But fallout would reach almost everywhere , would n't it ? " " I guess . " " So did you think you were going to die ? " " Maybe . I thought about it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " Not good . " " Is that all ? "  | " I worried about my mother and sisters , about what would happen to them . My father had been dead for some time , and I was the man of the house , so it seemed like I should be doing something to protect them , to insure their survival , you know , but I could n't think of anything , and that made me feel so helpless . . . half sick with helplessness . " She seemed disappointed , as if she had hoped for another response from me , something more dramatic . . . or darker . " Where were you that week ? " I asked . " Gibtown . There 're some military installations not far from there , a prime target . " " So you expected to die ? " I asked . " Yes . " " So how did you feel about it ? " She was silent . " Well ? " I pressed . " How did you feel about the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was a disturbing and inadequate answer , but before I could ask for elaboration , I was distracted by distant lightning , far off to the west . I said , " We better go down . " " Not yet . " " There 's a storm coming . " " We 've got plenty of time . " She rocked the two-seat basket as if it were a porch swing , and the hinges creaked . In a voice that made me cold she said , " When the war did n't happen , I went to the library and checked out all their books on nuclear weapons . I wanted to know what it would 've been like if it had happened , and all last winter , down there in Gibtown , I studied up on it . Could n't get enough about it . It 's fascinating , Slim . " Again lightning throbbed out there at the edge of the world . Rya 's face flickered , and it seemed that the erratic pulse of light came from within her , that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jagged line of the far horizon , as if the lowering sky had collided with the tops of the mountains . Echoes of the collision rolled sonorously through the clouds above the carnival . " We better go down , " I said . Ignoring me , her voice low but clear , infused with awe , each word as soft as a footstep on the plush carpet of a funeral home , she said , " Nuclear holocaust would have a strange beauty , you know , a terrible beauty . The shabbinessp160and filth of the cities would all be pulverized and boiled up in smooth , spreading mushroom clouds , just the way real mushroomsgrow out of manure and take their strength from it . And picture the sky ! Crimson and orange , green with acidic mist , yellow with sulfurs , churning , roiling , mottled with colors we 've never seen in the sky before , rippling with strange light .... " Like a rebel angel pitched out of paradise , a bolt of lightningburst brilliantly above , staggered down celestial steps , diminishing as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was much closer than the previous lightning . The crash of thunder was louder than before . The air smelled of ozone . " It 's dangerous up here , " I said , reaching for the latch that held the safety bar in place . She stayed my hand and said , " For months after the war there would be the most incredible sunsets because of all the pollution and ash circling high in the atmosphere . And when the ash began to settle out , there would be a certain beauty in that , too , not unlike a heavy snowstorm , although it would be the longest blizzard anyone ever saw , lasting months and months , and even the jungles , where there 's never snow , would be iced and drifted by that storm .... " The air was moist and thick . Massive war machines of thunder rumbled on battlefields above . I put my hand on hers , but she held fast to the latch . She said , " And finally , after a couple of years , the radioactivitywould @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pose a danger to life . The sky would be clear and blue again , and the rich ashes would provide a bed and nutrients for grasses greener and thicker than any we 've ever seen , and the air would be cleaner for all that scouring . And the insects would rule the earth , and there would be a special beauty in that too . " Less than a mile away , a whip of lightning cracked in the dark and briefly scarred the skin of the night . " What 's wrong with you ? " I asked , my heart suddenly stuttering faster , as if the tip of that electric whip had lightly flicked me , jump-starting an engine of fear . She said , " You do n't think there 's beauty in the insect world ? "  | " Rya , for God 's sake , this seat 's metal . Most of the wheel is metal . " " The bright colors of the butterfly , the iridescent green of a beetle 's wings  --  " " We 're the highest goddamned thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " "  --  the orange and black of a ladybug 's carapace  --  " " Rya , if lightning strikes , we 'll be fried alive ! " " We 'll be okay . " " We 've got to get down . " " Not yet , not yet , " she whispered . She would not relinquish the latch . She said , " With only insects and maybe a few small animals , how clean it would all be again , how fresh and new ! Without people around to dirty it up , to  --  " She was interrupted by a fierce and angry flash . Directly overhead a white craze crackled across the black dome of the sky , like a zigzagging line of stress in a ceramic glaze . The accompanying explosion of thunder was so violent that it made the Ferris wheel vibrate . And yet another thunderclap boomed , and my bones seemed to rattle together in spite of their padding of flesh , like a gambler 's favorite pairs of dice in the muffling confinement of a warm felt bag . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now , " she agreed as a few fat droplets of warm rain began to fall . In the stroboscopic light , her grin fluctuated between childlike excitement and macabre glee . She thumbed the latch that she had been guarding , and she flung the safety bar wide open . " Now ! Go ! Let 's see who wins  --  us or the storm ! " Because I was the last into the basket , I had to be the first out , the first to take the gamble . I swung off the seat , grabbed one of the girders that formed the big wheel 's rim , wrapped my legs around the nearest spoke , which was another thick girder , and slid down perhaps four feet , at an angle to the ground , until I was blocked from further descent by one of the crossbeams that served as braces between the mammoth spokes . For a moment , still at a deadly height , stricken by vertigo , I clung to that junction of beams . Some of the enormous raindrops sliced through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped into me with the impact of lightly thrown pebbles , and some struck the Ferris wheel with an audible plop-plop-plop . The vertigo did not entirely pass , but Ryap162came out onto the frame above me , waiting for me to move down and out of her way , and lightning flashed again to remind me of the danger of electrocution , so I drove myself off the spoke , to the crossbeam under it . Panting , I slid along that beam to the next spoke , and very quickly it became clear that descent was far more difficult than ascent because this time we were going backward . The rain fell harder , and the wind rose , and getting a firm grip on the wet steel became more difficult by the moment . Several times I slipped , grabbed desperately at tightly strung cables or girders or slender struts or anything else that was within reach , whether or not it seemed strong enough to support me , and I tore a fingernail and got a friction burn on one palm . Sometimes the wheel seemed like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightning would scuttle at any moment , intent upon devouring me . But at other times it might have been an enormous roulette wheel ; the whirling rain , brisk wind , and chaotic storm light  --  combined with my lingering vertigo  --  produced an illusion of movement , a phantom spinning , and when I looked up across the shadow-flickered expanse of the wheel , it seemed that Rya and I were two hapless ivory balls being flung toward separate destinies . The rain combed my sodden hair into my eyes . My soaked jeans soon felt like armor , dragging me down . When I was about ten feet off the ground , I slipped and found nothing to grab this time . I shot out into the rain , arms spread in useless imitation of wings , unleashing a shrill bird cry of fright . I was sure I was going to hit something pointed and be impaled thereon . Instead I sprawled in the mud , knocking the breath out of myself , but I was unhurt . I rolled onto my back , looked up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain , her hair wet and tangled yet snapping like a beribboned pennant in the wind . Three stories up , her feet slipped off a beam , and abruptly she was hanging by her hands , all of her weight on her slender arms , legs kicking as she scrambled to find the unseen girder below her . Slipping in the mud , I got to my feet , stood with head tilted back , face turned up to the rain , watching , breathless . I had been mad to allow her to climb up there . This was , after all , where she would die . This was what my vision had warned against . I should have told her . I should have stopped her . In spite of her precarious position , in spite of the fact thatp163her arms must have been ablaze with pain and on the verge of dislocating at the shoulder sockets , I thought I heard her laughing up there . Then I realized it must be only the wind fluting through the beams and struts and cables . Surely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Around me the carnival was momentarily incandescent , and above me the Ferris wheel was briefly revealed in stark detail . For an instant I was sure the bolt had struck the wheel itself and that a billion volts had seared the flesh off Rya 's bones , but in the less cataclysmic sheet-lightning that followed the big flash , I saw that she had not only been spared electrocution but also had gotten her feet under herself . She was inching down once more . Foolish as it was , I cupped my hands around my mouth and shouted , " Hurry ! " Spoke to crossbeam , crossbeam to spoke , spoke to crossbeamagain , she descended , but my galloping heartbeat was not reigned in even when she was down far enough to eliminatethe threat of a killing fall . As long as she clung to any part of the wheel , she was in danger of receiving the white-hot kiss of the storm . At last she was only eight feet from the ground . She turned to face outward , clutching at the wheel with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when a night-spearing lance of lightning stabbed into the earth just beyond the midway , no more than fifty yards distant , and the crash seemed to fling her off the wheel . She landed on her feet , stumbled , but I was there to grab her and prevent her from falling in the mud , and her arms went around me , mine around her . We hugged very tight , both of us shaking , unable to move , unable to speak , barely able to breathe . Another night-shattering fulmination sent a tongue of fire from sky to earth , and this one did , at last , lick the Ferris wheel , which lit up along every spoke and crossbeam , each cable a blazing filament , and for an instant it seemed that the huge machine was encrusted with jewels through which raced lambent reflections of flames . Then the killing power was bled off into the earth , through the wheel 's supporting frame and guy wires and anchor chains , which all served as groundingpoints . The storm abruptly worsened , became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , snapped and thudded againstp164the walls of the tents , struck a dozen different notes on a variety of metal surfaces , and the wind shrieked . We ran across the carnival , through the mud , breathing air tainted with ozone and with the scent of wet sawdust and with the not entirely unpleasant odor of elephants , off the midway and down to the meadow , into the encampment of trailers . On many spider-quick , crab-hinged legs of electricity , a monster pursued us and seemed always at our heels . We did not feel safe until we were in Rya 's Airstream , with the door shut behind us . " That was crazy ! " I said . " Hush , " she said . " Why did you keep us up there when you saw the storrn coming ? " " Hush , " she repeated . " Did you think that was fun ? " She had taken two glasses and a bottle of brandy from one of the kitchen cabinets . Dripping , smiling , she headed for the bedroom . Following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sake ? " In the bedroom she splashed brandy in both glasses and handed one to me . The glass chattered against my teeth . The brandy was warm in the mouth , hot in the throat , scalding in the stomach . Rya pulled off her sopping tennis shoes and socks , then skinned out of her wet T-shirt . Beads of water glimmered and trembled on her bare arms , shoulders , breasts . " You could have been killed , " I said . She slipped off her shorts and panties , took another sip of brandy , and came to me . " Were you hoping to get killed , for Christ 's sake ? " " Hush , " she repeated . I was shuddering uncontrollably . She seemed calm . If she had been afraid during the climb , the fear had left her the moment she had touched ground again . " What is it with you ? " I asked . Instead of answering , she began to undress me . " Not now , " I said . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , " she insisted . " I 'm not in the mood  --  " " Perfect mood . " " I ca n't  --  "  | " You can . " " No . " " Yes . " " No . " " See ? " Later we lay for a while in contented silence , on top of the damp sheets , our bodies tinted gold by the amber light of the bedside lamp . The sound of rain striking the rounded roof and sluicing along the curved metal skin of our cocoon was wonderfully soothing . But I had not forgotten the wheel or the petrifying climb down through the storm-lashed girders , and after a while I said , " It was almost as if you wanted lightning to strike while you were hanging up there . " She said nothing . With the knuckles of my folded hand , I lightly traced the line of her jaw , then opened my fingers to caress her smooth , supple throat and the slopes of her breasts . " You 're beautiful , smart , successful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have everything to live for . " She remained silent . The carny 's code of privacy restrained me from coming right out and asking why she had a death wish . But the code did not prohibit me from commenting on plainly observed events and facts , and it seemed to me that her suicidal impulsewas far from secret . So I said , " Why ? " And I said , " Do you really think there 's something . . . attractive about death ? " Unfazed by her continued taciturnity , I said , " I think I love you . " And when even that drew no response , I said , " I do n't want anything to happen to you . I wo n't let anything happen to you . " She turned on her side , clung to me , buried her face against my neck , and said , " Hold me , " which was , under the circumstances , about the best answer I could hope for . Heavy rain was still falling Monday morning . The sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I felt I could touchp166it with the aid of just a little stepladder . According to the weather report , the skies would not clear until sometime Tuesday . At nine o'clock , the show call was canceled , and the start of the Yontsdown County Fair was postponed twenty-four hours . By nine-thirty , card games and knitting circles and mutual misery societies had sprung up all over Gibtown-onWheels . By a quarter till ten , the revenue lost on account of the rain had been exaggerated to such an extent that ( judging by the moaning ) every concessionaire and pitchman would have been a millionaire if only the traitorous weather had not brought bankruptcy instead . And shortly before ten o'clock , Jelly Jordan was found dead on the carousel.  |p167By  the time I got to the midway , a hundred carnies were crowded around the carousel , most of whom I had yet to meet . Some wore yellow rain slickers with matching shapelesshats , and some wore black vinyl coats , a few with plastic babushkas , boots or sandals , galoshes or street shoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on over pajamas , and about half of them carried umbrellas , which came in a variety of colors yet failed to contribute a note of gaiety to the gathering . Others had not dressed for the storm at all , rushing out in disbelief at the dreadful news , unheeding of the weather , and these now huddled in two kinds of misery  --  dampness and grief  --  soaked to the skin and spotted with mud and looking like refugees lined up at a border crossing on some war-tom frontier . I came in T-shirt , jeans , and shoes that had not dried out from the previous night , and as I approached the crowd at the carousel , I was impressed and shaken , most of all , by their silence . No one spoke . No one . Not a word . They were doubly washed by rain and tears , and their pain was visible in their ashen faces and in their sunken eyes , but they wept without a sound . This silence was a mark of how deeply they had loved Jelly Jordan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dead ; they were so stunned that they couldp168only stand in mute contemplation of a world without him . Later , when the shock had worn off , there would be loud lamentations , uncontrollable sobbing , hysteria , mournful keening , prayers , and perhaps angry questions asked of God , but at the moment their intense grief was a perfect vacuum through which sound waves could not travel . They knew Jelly better than I did , but I could n't remain discreetly at the crowd 's periphery . I shouldered slowly through the mourners , whispering " Excuse me " and " Sorry " until I reached the raised platform of the merry-go-round . Rain slanted beneath the red-and-white-striped roof , beaded on and trickleddown the brass poles , and cooled the wooden horseflesh . I eased past upraised hoofs and enameled teeth bared in equine excitement , past painted flanks all of a piece with saddles and stirrups that could not be removed , wended through the herd on its never-ending journey , until I came to the place where Jelly Jordan 's journey had ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back , on the carousel floor , between a black stallion and a white mare , eyes open in amazement at finding himself recumbent in the middle of this trampling drove , as if he had been done in by their hoofs . His mouth was open , too , lips split , at least one tooth broken . It almost looked as if a cowboy 's red bandanna masked the lower part of his face , but it was a veil of blood . He was dressed in an unbuttoned raincoat , white shirt , and dark gray slacks . The right leg of his trousers was bunched up around his knee , and part of his thick white calf was exposed . His right foot was shoeless , and that missing loafer was wedged in the rigidly fixed stirrup of the black stallion 's wooden saddle . Three people were with the corpse . Luke Bendingo , who had driven us to and from Yontsdown last Friday , stood by the hindquarters of the white mare , his face the same shade as the horse , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  was a stutter of grief and rage momentarily repressed by shock . Kneeling on the floor was a man I had never seen before . He was in his sixties , quite dapper , gray-haired , with a neatly trimmed gray mustache . He was behind Jelly 's body , and he was holding the dead man 's head , as if he were a faith healer intent on restoring health to the afflicted . He was racked by unvoiced sobs , and each miserable spasm squeezed more tears out of him . The third was Joel Tuck , who stoodp169one horse removed from the scene , his back against a pinto , one huge hand fastened to a brass pole . On that mutant face , which was a cross between a cubist portrait by Picasso and something out of one of Mary Shelley 's nightmares , the expression could not , for once , be misread : He was devastatedby the loss of Jelly Jordan . Sirens wailed in the distance , grew louder , louder , then died away with a moan . A moment later two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashing through the lead-gray light and mist and rain . When they pulled up by the carousel , when I heard doors opening and closing , I looked over at them and saw that three of the four arriving Yontsdown officers were goblins . I felt Joel 's eyes on me , and when I looked at him , I was unsettled by the unexpected suspicion both in his twisted face and in the psychic aura that enveloped him . I had expected him to be as interested in the goblin cops as I was , and he did glance at them warily , but I remained the focus of his attention and suspicion . That look  --  plus the arrival of the goblins , plus a cyclonic fury of terrible psychic emanations that blasted up from the corpse  --  was just too much to deal with , so I walked away from there . For a while I wandered along the back of the midway , as far from the carousel as I could get , through rain that was sometimes a heavy drizzle and sometimes a flooding cloudburst , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joel had seen me kill the man in the Dodgem Car pavilion and had assumed that I had committed that murder because , like him , I saw the goblin beyond the human glaze . But now Jelly was dead , and there had been no goblin in poor Timothy Jordan , and Joel was wondering if he had misunderstood me . He was probably beginning to think that perhaps I had not been aware of the goblin residing in my first victim , that I was just a killer , pure and simple , and that now I had claimed a second victim , this one innocent . But I had not harmed Jelly , and it was not Joel Tuck 's suspicion that burdened me with guilt . I felt guilty because I had known Jelly was in danger , had seen the vision of his face smeared with blood , and I had not alerted him . I should have been able to foresee the precise moment of his crisis , should have been able to predict exactly where and when and how he would meet his death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Never mind that my psychic powersp170are limited , that the clairvoyant images and impressions they bring me are often vague or confusing , and that I have little  --  and frequently no  --  control over them . Never mind that he would not have believed me even if I had tried to warn him of the nameless danger that I had sensed . Never mind that I am not  --  and can not be  --  the savior of the whole damned world and every damned sorry soul in it . Never mind . I still should have been able to prevent it . I should have saved him . I should have . I should have . The card games , knitting circles , and other gatherings in Gibtown-on-Wheels had become knots of mourners . The carniestried to help one another accept Jelly 's death . Some of them still wept . A few prayed . But most of them swapped stories about Jelly because memories were a way of keeping him alive . They sat in circles in the living rooms of the trailers , and when one finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next in the circle would make a contribution , and then the next , around and around , and there was even laughter because Jelly Jordan had been an amusing and exceptional man , and gradually the terrible bleakness gave way to a bittersweet sadness that was more easily borne . The subtle formality of these proceedings , the almost unconscious ritual according to which they were conducted , made them seem remarkably like the Jewish tradition of sitting shivah ; if I had been required to hold my hands above a basin and have water poured over them before being permitted to enter , and if I had been provided with a black yarmulke to cover my head , and if I had found everyone sitting on mourning stools instead of on chairs and sofas , I would not have been surprised . I spent a few hours walking in the rain , and periodically I stopped at one trailer or another , participated in one shivah or another , and at each place I picked up another bit of news . First I learned that the dapper gray-haired man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sombra , the only living Sombra brother , owner of the carnival . Jelly Jordan had been his surrogate son and had been in line to inherit the carnival when the old man passed on . The cops were making it even harder on Mr. Sombra by proceeding under the assumption that foul play was involved and that the murdererp171was a carny . To everyone 's absolute astonishment the cops were even insinuating that Jelly might have been eliminated because his position with the company gave him plenty of opportunity to dip his hand in the till and because maybe he had taken advantage of that opportunity . They were suggestingthat the murderer could even be Mr. Sombra himself , although there was no good reason to entertain such suspicions  --  andconsiderable reason to reject them out of hand . They were grilling the old man and Cash Dooley and anyone else who might have known if Jelly was skimming , and they were as thoroughly rude and nasty in their interrogations as they knew how to be . Everyone in the trailer town was outraged . I was not surprised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accusations of murder against anyone . But three of them were goblins . They had seen the numbing grief of those hundred mourners clustered around the carousel ; that anguish had not only delighted them but had whetted their appetite for more human misery . They would not be able to resist adding to our pain , milking it , squeezing the last drop of agony from Arturo Sombra and the rest of us . Later , the word was that the county coroner had arrived , had examined the body in situ , had asked a few questions of Arturo Sombra , and had rejected the possibility of foul play . To everyone 's relief , the official determination was " death by misadventure . " Apparently , it was widely known that when he could not sleep , Jelly sometimes went to the midway , started the carousel ( though not the calliope music ) , and went for a long ride all by himself . He loved the merry-go-round . The merry-go-round was the biggest wind-up toy of them all , much too big to be kept on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his size , Jelly sat on one of the elaborately carved and intricately painted benches that boasted arms in the form of mermaids or sea horses . But once in a while he climbed onto one of the horses , which must have been what he did last night . Perhaps worrying about the revenue that would be lost because of the bad weather , perhaps concerned about trouble that Chief Lisle Kelsko might stir up , sleepless and searching for a way to soothe his nerves , Jelly mounted the blackp172stallion while it was moving , sat in the wooden saddle , one hand on the brass pole , the summery wind ruffling his hair , gliding around in the darkness , with no sound but the thunder and pouring rain , most likely grinning with the unselfconsciouspleasure of a child , maybe whistling , happily ensconcedaboard a magic centrifuge that flung away the years as it whirled , flung away years and worries while it gathered in dreams , and after a while he began to feel better and decided to return to bed  --  but as he dismounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stirrup , and although his foot pulled free of the loafer , he fell . In the fall , even as short as it was , he split his lips and knocked out two teeth and broke his neck . That was the official determination . Death by misadventure . An accident . A stupid , ridiculous , pointless way to die , but nothing more than a tragic accident . Bullshit . I did n't know exactly what had happened to Jelly Jordan , but I did know a goblin had murdered him in cold blood . Earlier , standing over his body , I 'd been able to sort three facts from the kaleidoscopically fragmented images and sensationsthat had assaulted me : first , that he had not died on the carousel but , instead , in the shadow of the Ferris wheel ; second , that a goblin had struck him at least three times , had broken his neck , and had carried him to the merry-go-round with the assistance of other goblins . The accident had been staged . Some assumptions could be made without much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently gone for a walk on the midway , in the dark , in the storm , and he had seen something he should not have seen . What ? He must have glimpsed strangers , not carries , who had undertaken suspiciouswork at the Ferris wheel , and he must have shouted at them , unaware that they were not ordinary men . Instead of running , they had attacked him . I said that I had clearly sensed three things while standing in the carousel , looking down at the fat man 's uninhabited mortal shell . The third was the one with which I had the most difficulty dealing , for it was an intensely personal moment of contact with Jelly , a glimpse inside his mind that made the loss of him even more poignant . Clairvoyantly I had per/ceived his dying thought . It lingered there with the corpse , waiting to be read by someone like me , a scrap of psychic energy like a rag caught on a barbed-wire fence that marked the boundary between here and eternity . As his life was extinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , furcoveredmechanical bears  --  Papa , Mama , Baby  --  that his mother had given him for his seventh birthday . He had loved those toys so much . They had been special , the perfect gift at the perfect time , for that birthday had come only two months after his father had been killed in front of his eyes , struck by a runaway city bus in Baltimore , and it had been the windup bears that had at last provided much-needed fantasy and a temporary refuge from a world that had suddenly seemed too cold , too cruel , too arbitrary to be endured . Now , dying , Jelly had wondered if he , himself , were Baby Bear and if , where he was going , he would be reunited with Mama and Papa . And he was afraid of winding up somewhere dark and empty , alone . I can not control my psychic powers . I can not shut my Twilight Eyes to these images . If I could , dear God , I never would have tuned in on the soul-shattering terror of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the abyss . It haunted me that day , as I walked in the rain , as I went to the trailers where they talked of our patch and mourned him , as I stood by the Ferris wheel and cursed the demonkind . It haunted me for years after . In fact , to this day , when sleep eludes me and I am in a particularly bleak mood , I sometimes involuntarily recall Jelly 's emotions at death , and they are so vivid that they might as well be my own emotions . I can handle it now . I can handle almost anything these days , after what I have been through and all that I have seen . But that day on the Yontsdown County Fairgrounds . . . I was only seventeen . By three o'clock Monday afternoon , the word in the trailer town was that Jelly 's body had been taken to a Yontsdown mortuary , where it was to be cremated . An urn full of ashes would be returned to Arturo Sombra either tomorrow or Wednesday , and on Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a funeral . The service would be held at the carousel because Jelly had liked it so much and because ,  |p174su|p|posedly  , it was there that he had found a way out of this world . That night Rya Raines and I had dinner together in her trailer . I made crisp green salads , and she made excellent cheese omelets , but neither of us ate much . We were not very hungry . We spent the evening in bed , but we did not make love . We sat up , braced by pillows , and held hands , drank a little , kissed a little , talked a little . More than once , Rya wept for Jelly Jordan , and her tears were a surprise to me . Although I had no doubt that she was capable of grief , I had thus far seen her cry only in contemplation of her own mysterious burden or affliction , and even then she had seemed to release the tears grudgingly , as if a tremendous inner pressure were forcing them from her against her will . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the naked grip of passion  --  she took refuge in her cool , hard-bitten , tight-lipped persona , pretending that the world could not touch her . I had sensed that her attachments to other carries were far stronger and deeper than she was willing to admit even to herself . Now , her sorrow at the death of the patch seemed proof of my perception . I had shed tears earlier , but now I was dry-eyed , beyond grief , immersed in a cold rage . I still mourned Jelly , but more than that , I wanted to avenge him . And I would . Sooner or later I would kill a few goblins for no reason other than to even the score , and if I was lucky , I might be able to get my hands on the very same creatures that had broken Jelly 's neck . Besides , my concern had shifted from the dead to the living , and I was acutely aware that my vision of Rya 's death might be fulfilled as unexpectedly as had been the prophecy of Jelly 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not must not , would not , dare not  --  allow any harm to come to her . In a circumspect manner that was decidedly peculiar for a pair of lovers , we were forming a bond unlike any I had ever known , nor could I imagine another relationshiplike it in the future . If Rya Raines died , a part of me would die , too , and there would be burned-out rooms within me that could never again be entered.  |p175Preventive  measures must be taken . On those nights that I did not sleep in her trailer , I would post myself , without her knowledge , just outside her door . I could suffer from insomniathere as well as anywhere . Furthermore I would probe more relentlessly with my sixth sense , in search of additional details about the as yet vaguely defined threat the future held in store for her . If I could predict the precise moment of her crisis and could pinpoint the source of the danger , I could protect her . I must not fail her as I had failed Jelly Jordan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and perhaps she was also aware that I intended to be there when she needed help , for as the evening wore on , she began to share some secrets about herself , and I sensed that she was telling me things she had told no one else in the Sombra Brothers Carnival . She was drinking more than usual . Although she was not drunk by any definition , I suspected that she was trying to establish an alibi of inebriation , which would be convenient when , in the morning , she found herself full of self-reproach and regret for having told me so much about her past . " My parents were n't carries , " she said in such a way that it was clear she wanted to be encouraged in her revelations . " Where are you from ? " I asked . " West Virginia . My people were hill people in West Virginia . We lived in a ramshackle dump in a hollow up in the hills , probably half a mile from the nearest other ramshackle dump . Do you know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Poor , " she said scathingly . " That 's nothing to be ashamed of . " " Poor , uneducated , unwilling to be educated , ignorant . Secretive , withdrawn , suspicious . Set in their ways , stubborn , close-minded . And some of them . . . a lot of them , maybe  --  are too inbred . Cousin marries cousin pretty frequently up in those hills . And worse than that . Worse than that . " Gradually , with steadily less coaxing , she told me about her mother , Maralee Sween . Maralee was the fourth of seven children born to first cousins whose marriage had not been blessed by either minister or state but existed only by virtue of common law . All of the Sween children were good-looking kids , but one of the seven was retarded , and five of the other six were more dull-witted than not . Maralee was not the bright one , though she was the best-looking of the seven , ap176radiant blonde with luminous green eyes and a lush figure that had every hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Long before her ample charms had matured , Maralee had considerable sexual  --  one could certainly not say romantic  --  experience . At an age when many girls are having their first date and are still unsure of the exact meaning of " going all the way , " Maralee had stopped counting the number of hill boys who had spread her legs on various grassy beds , in leafcarpetedglens , in the haylofts of decaying old barns , on a moldering mattress discarded at the edge of the makeshift dump that the hill people had started in Harmon 's Hollow , and in the musty backseats of different automobiles in one of the many collections of junked cars of which hillbillies seemed so fond . Sometimes she 'd been a. willing participant in the sex , and sometimes she had not , and most of the time she had not cared one way or the other . In the hills , her fall from innocence at such a tender age was not unusual . The only surprise was that she managed to avoid pregnancy until well past her fourteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those hillbillies , the rule of law and the morality of polite society were disdained , generally ignored ; however , unlike carnies , the denizensof those remote hollows did not create their own rules and codes to replace those they rejected . There is in American literature a tradition of tales about the " noble savage , " and our culture at least pretends to believe that a life lived close to nature and far from the evils of civilization is somehow healthier and wiser than the lives that most of us lead . In fact , the opposite is often true . As men retreat from civilization they quickly shed the inessential trappings of modem society  --  luxury cars , fancy houses , designer clothes , nights at the theater , concert tickets  --  and perhaps an argument can be made for the virtues of a simpler life , but if they go far enough away and stay long enough , they also shed too many inhibitions . Inhibitions implanted by religion and society are not generally foolish or pointless or narrow-minded , as it has recently become fashionable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly desirable survival traits that in the long run contribute to a better-educated , better-fed , more prosperouspopulace . The wilderness is wild and encourages wildness ; it is the breeding ground of savagery . At fourteen Maralee was pregnant , illiterate , uneducated , and virtually uneducable , without prospects , with too littlep177imagination to be terrified for herself , too slow-thinking to fully appreciate the fact that the rest of her life was destined to be a long , cruel slope into a terrible abyss . With bovine calm she was sure that someone would come along to take care of her and the baby . The baby was Rya , and before Rya was even born , someone did offer to make an honest woman of Maralee Sween , perhaps proving that God watches over pregnant hillbilly girls about as well as He looks out for drunks . The chivalrous gentleman in pursuit of Maralee 's hand was Abner Kady , thirty-eight , twenty-six years her senior , six-five , two hundred and forty pounds , with a neck almost as thick as his head , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly in short supply . Abner Kady made a sort of living by brewing moonshine , raising coon dogs , and engaging in petty theft and occasional grand larceny . Once or twice a year he would get together with some buddies and hijack a truck off the state highway , preferably one loaded with cigarettes or whiskey or some other cargo that could be disposed of at top dollar . They traded the booty to a fence they knew in Clarksburg , and either they would have become halfway rich or wound up in prison if they had worked harder at it , but their ambition was no greater than their scruples . Kady was not only a moonshiner , brawler , bully , and thief , but he was a casual rapist as well , taking a woman by force when he was in the mood for spicing his sex with a bit of danger , but he never had to take a ride on the prison train because nobody had the guts to testify against him . To Maralee Sween , Abner Kady looked like a real catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shack but with indoor plumbing  --  and no one in his family would ever want for whiskey , food , or clothes . If Abner could not steal what he needed one way , he would steal it another , and in the hills that was the mark of a good provider . He was good to Maralee , too , or at least as good as he was to anyone . He did not love her . He was not capable of love . Still , though he browbeat her , he never actually laid a hand on her , mostly because he was proud of her beauty and endlessly excited by her body , and he could not have been proud of  --  or aroused by  --  damaged merchandise . " Besides , " Rya said in a voice that now fell to a haunted whisper , " he did n't want to damage his little fun machine . That 's what he called her  --  his little fun machine . ' "  |p178By  " fun machine , " I sensed that Abner Kady had not meant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , something dark . Whatever it was , Rya was unable to speak of it without encouragement , even though I knew that she desperately wanted to unburden herself . Therefore I poured another drink for her , held her hand , and with gentle words I eased her through that mine field of memory . Tears shimmered in her eyes again , and this time they were not for Jelly but for herself . She was harder on herself than she was on anyone else , and she did not allow herself ordinaryhuman weaknesses like self-pity , so she blinked the tears back regardless of the emotional stress and turmoil that might have been washed away with them if she had only allowed them to flow . Haltingly , in a voice that broke every few words , she said , " He meant that . . . she was . . . his baby machine . . . and that . . . babies . . . could be fun . Especially . . . especially . . . girl babies . " I knew then that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey into the spooky witch-woods but into a far more frightening place , into a monstrous memory of a childhood under siege , and I was not sure that I wanted to go with her . I loved her .. I knew that Jelly 's death had not only sorrowed but frightened her , had reminded her of her own mortality , and had birthed in her a need for intimate human contact , a contact she could not fully achieve until she had broken down the barrier that she had erected between herself and the rest of the world . She needed me to listen , to draw her out , to understand . I wanted to be there for her . But I was afraid that her secrets were . . . well , alive and hungry , and that they would reveal themselves only in return for a piece of my own soul . I said , " Ah . . . Jesus . . . no . " " Girl babies , " she repeated , looking neither at me nor at anything else in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dread and loathing . " Not that he ignored my half brothers . He had uses for , them , too . But he preferred girls . My mother gave him four kids by the time I was eleven , two girls and two boys . As far back as I can remember . . . I guess since I was at least three . . . he was ... " " Touching you , " I said thickly . " Using me , " she said . In a dead voice she recounted those years of fear , violence , and the foulest abuse . Her story left me cold and black inside.  | " It was all I knew from the time I was a baby . . . being with him . . . doing what he wanted . . . touching him .. . and being in bed with both of them . . . my mother and him ... when they were doing it . I should 've thought it was normal , you know ? I should n't have known any better . I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . but I did n't . I knew it was wrong . . . sick . . . and I hated it . I hated it ! " I held her . I rocked her in my arms . She would still not cry for herself . " I hated Abner . Oh . . . Jesus . . . you ca n't know how much I hated him , with every breath I drew , every moment , without relief . You ca n't know what it 's like to hate that intensely . " 1 thought of my own feelings toward the goblins , and I wondered if even that could match the hatred spawned and nurtured in the hellhole of that four-room shack in the Appalachians . I suspected she was right : I could not know a hatred as pure as that of which she spoke , for she had been a weak child unable to strike back , and her hatred had had more years than mine to grow and intensify . " But then . . . after I got out of there . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came to hate my mother more than him . She was my mother . Why was n't I s-sacred to her ? How could she . . . let me . . . b-b-be used like that ? " I had no answer . This one could not be blamed on God . Most of the time we do not need either Him or the goblins ; we can hurt and destroy one another without divine or demonic assistance , thank you very much . " She was so pretty , you know , and not in a brassy way , very sweet-looking , and I used to think that she must be an angel because that 's what angels were supposed to look like , and she had this . . . radiance . . . . But eventually I came to see how evil she was . Oh , part of it was ignorance and low intelligence . She was stupid , Slim . Hillbilly stupid , the productof a marriage between two first cousins who were probablyalso the product of cousins , and the miracle is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freak in Joel Tuck 's sideshow . But I did n't . And I did n't wind up bearing more children for Abner to . . . molest . For one thing , because of ... because of things he did to me . . . I can never havep180children . And besides , when I was eleven , I finally got out of there . " " Eleven ? How ? " " I killed him . " " Good , " I said softly . " While he was sleeping . " " Good . " " I put a butcher knife in his throat . " For almost ten minutes I held her , and neither of us spoke or reached for a drink or did anything but just be there . At last I said , " I 'm so sorry . " " Do n't be . " " I feel so helpless . " " You ca n't change the past , " she said . No , I thought , but I can sometimes change the future , foresee the dangers and avoid them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there when you need me , the way no one else has ever been for you . She said , " I 've never ... " " Told anyone else ? " " Never . " " It 's safe with me . " " I know . But . . . why did I choose to tell you ? " " I was here at the right time , " I said . " No . It 's more than that . " " What ? " " I do n't know , " she said . Now she leaned back from me and raised her eyes and looked into mine . " There 's something different about you , something special . " " Not me , " I said uncomfortably . " Your eyes are so beautiful and unusual . They make me feel . . . safe . There 's such . . . calmness in you . . . . No , not exactly calmness . . . because you are n't at peace , either . But strength . Such strength in you . And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and understanding and compassion . It 's . . . something special . . . something I ca n't define . " " You 're embarrassing me , " I said . " How old are you , Slim MacKenzie ? " " I told you . . . seventeen . " " No . " " No ? " " Older . "  | " Seventeen . " " Tell me the truth . " " Well , all right . Seventeen and a half . " " We ca n't approach the truth by half years , " she said . " That 'll take all night . So I 'll just tell you how old you are . I know . Judging from your strength , your calm , your eyes ... I 'd say you 're a hundred . . . with a hundred years of experience . " " Hundred and one in September , " I said , smiling . " Tell me your secret , " she said . " I do n't have one . " " Come on . Tell me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " You want me to be more than that because we always want things to be better and nobler and more interesting than they are . But I 'm just me . " " Slim MacKenzie . " " That 's right , " I lied , not sure why I did not want to open myself to her the way that she had opened herself to me . I was embarrassed , as I had told her , though not by anything she had said ; my blush was caused by the fact that I so quickly chose to deceive her . " Slim MacKenzie . No deep , dark secrets . Boring , in fact . But you 're not finished . What happened after you killed him ? " Silence . She did not want to return to the memories of those days . But then : " I was only eleven , so I did n't go to jail . In fact , when the authorities learned what had been going on in that shack , they said I was the victim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took all the kids away from my mother . They split us up . I 've never seen any of them again . I wound up in a state-run orphanage . " Suddenly I sensed another terrible secret in her , and I knew with clairvoyant certainty that something had happened in the orphanage that was at least equal to the horror of Abner Kady . " And ? " I asked . She looked away from me , reached to the nightstand for her drink , and said , " And I ran away from there when I was fourteen . I looked older . I matured early , like my mother . So I did n't have much trouble joining up with the carnival . Changed my name to Raines because . . . well , I 've alwaysp182liked the rain , liked watching it , listening to it . . . . Anyway , I 've been here ever since . " " Building an empire . " " Yeah . To make myself feel like I 'm worth something . " " You 're worth something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in money terms . " " Neither do I. " " Though that 's part of it . Because ever since I 've been on my own , I 've been determined never to be . . . trash . . . never to sink low again . . . . I 'm going to build my little empire , like you say , and I 'm always going to be somebody . " It was easy to see how a child , having endured so much abuse , could grow up with the feeling that she was worthless and could develop an obsession with success and achievement . I could understand it , and I could not fault her for the single-minded , brusque businesswoman that she had become . If she had not directed her rage into those endeavors , thereby relieving the pressure , it would have blown her apart sooner or later . I was in awe of her strength . But she still had not allowed herself to cry for herself . And she was hiding the truth about the orphanage , pretendingit had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press her for the rest of the story . For one thing , I knew that she would tell me sooner or later . The door had opened , and there would be no closing it again . Besides , I had already heard enough for one day , too much . The weight of this new knowledge had left me weak and sick . We drank . We talked of other things . We drank some more . We turned off the lights and lay sleepless . Then , for a while , we did sleep . And dreamed . The graveyard .. . In the middle of the night she woke me to make love . It was as good as it had been before , and when we were sated , I could not keep myself from wondering that , after the abuse she had endured , she could find such pleasure in the act . She said , " Some might have become frigid . . . or promiscuous . I do n't know why I did n't . Except . . . well . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would 've meant Abner Kady had won , had broken me . You understand ? But I 'll never bep183broken . Never . I 'll bend instead of break . I 'll survive . I 'll go on . I 'll become the most prosperous concessionaire in this outfit , and someday I 'll own this carnival . By God , I will ! You see if I do n't . That 's my goal , but do n't you dare tell anyone . I 'll do whatever 's necessary , work as hard as I have to , take whatever risks are called for , and I will own the whole thing , and then I 'll be somebody , and it wo n't matter where I came from or what happened to me when I was a little girl , and it wo n't matter that I never knew my father or that my mother did n't love me , because I 'll have lost all that , I 'll have lost it and forgotten it the way I lost my hillbilly accent . You see if I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait and see . " As I said when I began this story , hope is a constant companion in this life . It is the one thing that neither cruel nature , God , nor other men can wrench from us . Health , wealth , parents , beloved brothers and sisters , children , friends , the past , the future  --  all can be stolen from us as easily as an unguarded purse . But our greatest treasure , hope , remains . It is a sturdy little motor within , purring , ticking , driving us on when reason would suggest surrender . It is both the most pathetic and noblest thing about us , the most absurd and the most admirable quality we possess , for as long as we have hope , we also have the capacity for love , for caring , for decency . In a while Rya slept again . I could not . Jelly was dead . My father was dead . Soon Rya might be dead if I could not foresee the exact nature of the oncoming danger and turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , went to the window , and drew back the drape just as several bolts of lightning  --  not as violent as those that had split the sky earlier in the night but neverthelessbright  --  blanked out the view beyond the window and transformed the glass into a flickering mirror . My pale reflectionfluttered flamelike , reminiscent of that film technique occasionally seen in old movies when the director wants to indicate the passage of time , and with each dimming and brightening of the image I felt as if years were being ripped away , that either the past or the future was being torn from me , but I could not tell which it was . For the duration of the lightning barrage , as I faced myp184ghostly reflection , I had a flash of solipsistic fear , which sprang from weariness and sadness , the feeling that only I really existed , that I encompassed all creation , and that everything and everyone else was a figment of my imagination . But then , as the last beat of lightning pulsed and faded , as transparency flowed back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clung to the outside of the rain-washed window , and the sight of it blew away the solipsistic fantasy . It was a small lizard , a chameleon , fixed to the pane with sucker-footed sureness , its belly revealed to me , its long , slender tail curving down in the shape of a question mark . It was there all the time that I had seen only my own reflection , and in becoming abruptly aware of it , I was reminded that we see so little of anything at which we look , that we are usually satisfied with simple surfaces , perhaps because the deeper view is often terrifying in its complexity . Now , beyond the chameleon , I saw the driving rain , sizzling-rattling curtains of silver beads as more distant lightning glimmered in a billion plummeting droplets , and beyond the rain was another trailer next door to this one , and beyond that lay other trailers , then the unseen midway , and beyond the midway lay the city of Yontsdown , and beyond Yontsdown . . . eternity . Rya murmured in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . She was a shadowy shape upon the sheets . I stood over her , watching her . I remembered what Joel Tuck had asked me in Shockville last Friday , when we had been discussing Rya : " Such a stunningly beautiful surface she has , and beauty underneath as well , we 're agreed on that . . . but is it possible that there is another underneath ' below the underneath ' that you can see ? " Until tonight , when she had taken me into her confidence and had shared with me the nightmare of her childhood , I had seen a Rya who was the equivalent of my lightning-painted reflection on the glass . Now I saw deeper and was tempted to believe that I finally knew the real and complete woman , in all dimensions , but in fact the Rya that I knew now was only a slightly more detailed shadow of the full reality . I had at last seen past the surface of her , had seen to the next layer , to the lizard on the windowpane , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not save Rya Raines until Ip185had delved much further into the chambered-nautilus mystery that curved around and around , almost to infinity within her . She murmured again . She thrashed . " Graves , " she said . " So many . . . graves . . She whimpered . She said , " Slim . . . oh . . . Slim , no ... " She scissored her legs in the sheets , as if running . " ... no ... no Her dream , my dream . How could we have the same dream ? And why ? What did it mean ? I stood over her , and I was able to see the graveyard when I closed my eyes , able to live the nightmare even as she plummeted through it . I waited tensely to see if she awoke with a strangled scream . I wanted to know if in her dream I caught her and tore out her throat the way I had done in my own version of the nightmare , for if that detail was the same , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if both her dream and mine ended with my teeth sinking into her flesh and with her blood spurting , then the best thing I could do for her was to leave , right now , go far away and never see her again . But she did not cry out . Her dream-panic subsided , and she ceased kicking , and her breathing became rhythmic , soft . Outside , the wind and rain sang an epicedium for the dead and for the living who cling to hope in a graveyard world.  |p186Tuesday  morning , the sky was without sun , and the storm was without lightning , and the rain was without wind . It fell straight down as if in exhaustion , a great burden of rain , fell by the pound and by the hundredweight , fell by the ton , crushing the grass , sighing wearily over the roofs of the trailers , fell upon the sloped roofs of tents and slid languidly to the ground and slept there in puddles , dripped from the Ferris wheel , plopped from the Dive Bomber . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yontsdown County Fair was postponed another twenty-four hours . Rya did not regret the previous night 's revelations as much as I had expected she would . At breakfast she smiled more quickly than the Rya whom I had come to know during the past week , and she was so given to little shows of affection that she would have forever damaged her reputation as a hard-nosed bitch if there had been anyone around to see . Later , when we paid visits to a couple of other carnies , to see how they were passing the time , she was more like the Rya they knew : cool , detached . However , even if she had been as changed in their company as she was when alone with me , I am not sure they would have noticed . A pall lay over Gibtown-on-Wheels , a drab and suffocating blanket of de/spondency woven partly from the monotony of the rain , partly from the loss of income that came with bad weather , but mostly from the fact that Jelly Jordan was only one day dead . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After stopping at the Lorus 's trailer , at the Frazellis ' , and at the Cutshanks ' , we finally decided to spend the day together , just the two of us , and then on the way back to Rya 's Airstream we made a more important decision . She stopped suddenly and gripped my umbrella arm with her rain-chilled hands . " Slim ! " she said , with a shine in her eyes not quite like anything I 'd seen before . So I said , " What ? " She said , " Let 's go to the trailer where you 've been assigned a bed  --  and let 's pack your things and move them to my place . " So I said , " You are n't serious , " praying to God that she was . And she said , " Do n't tell me you do n't want to . " I said , " All right , I wo n't tell you that . " Frowning , she said , " Hey , you know , this is n't your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think it was . " And she said , " This is your girl talking . " I said , " I just want to be sure you 've thought about this . " She said , " I have . " I said , " It looked like a spur-of-the-moment thought to me . " She said , " That 's the way I tried to make it look , dummy . I did n't want you to think I was a calculating woman . " I said , " I just want to be sure you are n't doing something rash . " She said , " Rya Raines never does anything rash . " So I said , " I guess that 's true , huh ? " And it was as easy as that . Fifteen minutes later , we were living together . We spent the afternoon making cookies in the tiny kitchen of her Airstream , four dozen peanut butter and six dozen chocolate chip , and it was one of the best days of my life . The mouth-watering aromas , the ceremonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the joking , the teasing , the shared labor  --  it all brought to mind similar afternoons in the kitchen of the Stanfeuss house in Oregon , with my sisters and my mother . But this was even better . I had enjoyed but never fully appreciated such afternoons in Oregon , for I had been too young to realize that I was living through golden hours , too young to see that all things end . Because I no longer labored under the childhood delusions of stasis and immortality , and because I had begun to think that I would never again be able to sample the simple pleasures of an ordinary domestic life , those hours in the kitchen with Rya had a poignancy so sharp , it was a sweet aching in my chest . We made dinner together , too , and after dinner we listenedp188to the radio : WBZ in Boston , KDKA in Pittsburgh , Dick Biondi making a fool of himself out there in Chicago . They played the songs of the time  --  " He 's So Fine , " by the Chiffons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boys ; " Rhythm of the Rain , " by the Cascades ; " Up on the Roof , " by the Drifters ; " Blowin ' in the Wind , " by Peter , Paul , and Mary ; and " Puff ( the Magic Dragon ) , " by the same ; " Limbo Rock " and " Sugar Shack , " " Rock Around the Clock , " and " My Boyfriend 's Back " ; tunes by Leslie Gore , the Four Seasons , Bobby Darin , the Chantays , Ray Charles , Little Eva , Dion , Chubby Checker , the Shirelles , Roy Orbison , Sam Cooke , Bobby Lewis , and Elvis , always Elvis  --  and if you do not think that was a good year for music , then you sure as hell were n't there . We did not make love that night , our first as live-in mates , but it could not have been better if we had . Nothing could have improved that evening . We had never been closer , not even when melded flesh to flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and although I pretended that I was nothing other than a simple drifter gratified and amazed to have found a home and someone to love , we nevertheless felt comfortable with each other , possibly because we harbored secrets in our minds but not in our hearts . At eleven o'clock the rain stopped . It suddenly faded from a roar to a patter , from a patter to a scattered plop-thump of fat drops , which was the way it had begun two days ago , then ceased altogether , leaving the night silent and steaming . Standingat the bedroom window , looking out at the misty darkness , I felt as if the storm had not only cleansed the world but had washed something out of me as well ; however , it was actually Rya Raines who had washed through me , and what she had scrubbed away was my loneliness . Among alabaster slabs in a hillside city of the dead , I seized her and swung her around to face me , and her eyes were wild with fear , and I was filled with pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went for it in spite of my regret , felt the soft tissue against my bared teethI pitched myself headlong out of sleep before the taste of her blood was in my mouth . I found myself sitting up in bed , hiding my face behind my hands , as if she might awaken and somehow , even in the darkness , be able to read my face andp189know what violence I had been about to perpetrate upon her in my dream . Then , to my surprise , I sensed someone standing in the gloom beside the bed . With a gasp , still under the influence of the miasma of conflicting terrors from the nightmare , I flung my hands away from my face and thrust them out defensively in front of me , drew back against the headboard . " Slim ? " It was Rya . She was standing beside the bed , looking down at me , though in this lap of blackness I could be no more visible to her than she was to me . She had been watching while I pursued her dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her last night . " Oh , Rya , it 's you , " I said thickly , releasing the painfully held breath in my chest , my heart stuttering . " What was wrong ? " she asked . " Dream . " " But what kind of dream ? " " Bad . " " Your goblins ? " " No . " " Was it . . . my graveyard ? " I said nothing . She sat on the edge of the bed . She said , " Was it ? " " Yes . How did you know ? " " From things you said in your sleep . " I looked at the radiant dial of the clock . Three-thirty . " And was I there in your dream ? " she asked . " Yes . " She made a sound that I could not interpret . I said , " I was chasing  --  " " No ! " she said quickly . " Do n't tell me . It does n't matter . I do n't want to hear any more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But it seemed clear that she knew it did matter , that she understood this shared nightmare better than I did , and that she knew precisely what such a strange sharing meant . Or , with veils of sleep still clinging to me and with torn rags of dreams muffling my thoughts and perceptions , perhaps I misapprehended her state of mind and saw a mystery where there was none . She might be reluctant to discuss thep190situation merely because it frightened her  --  not because she grasped and dreaded the meaning of it . When I began to speak again , she hushed me and came into my arms . She had never been more passionate , never more silken or more supple or more sweetly practiced in the elicitationof my response , but I thought I detected a new and disturbing quality to her lovemaking , a quiet desperation , as if she were not only seeking pleasure and closeness in the act but was pursuing forgetfulness , sanctuary from some dark knowledge that she could not bear , oblivion . Wednesday morning the clouds blew away on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and robins and ravens and bluebirds , and the earth still steamed as if mighty machinery labored in a heat of friction just beneath the thin crust of the planet , and on the midway the sawdust and wood shavings were drying out in the blazing August sun . Carnies were out in force , looking for storm damage , polishing chrome and brass , snugging down loosened tent flaps , and talking about " money weather , " which this surely was . An hour before the show call I located Joel Tuck behind the tent that housed Shockville . He was wearing woodsman 's boots with work pants tucked into the tops of them , and a red plaid shirt with the sleeves rolled up on his massive arms . He was pounding the tent pegs deeper into the moist earth , and although he was swinging a hammer instead of an ax , he looked like a mutant Paul Bunyon . " I have to talk to you , " I said . " I hear you 've got new accommodations , " he said , putting down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around that fast ? " " What do you have to talk to me about ? " he asked , not with blatant hostility but with a coolness he had never exhibitedbefore . " The Dodgem Car pavilion , for one thing . " " What about it ? " " I know that you saw what happened there . " " I do n't follow you . " " You followed me well enough that night . " His broken , unreadable expression made his face look likep191a ceramic mask that had been shattered , then glued back together by a drunkard on a binge . When he did not speak , I said , " You buried him under the floor of your tent . " " Who ? " " The goblin . " " Goblin ? " " That 's what I call them , goblins , though you might use another word . The dictionary says a goblin is an imaginary being , a demon in some mythologies , grotesque , malevolent to man . ' That 's good enough for me . You call them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see them . " " Do I , then ? Goblins ? " " I want you to understand three things . One , I hate them , and I 'll kill them whenever I have a chance  --  and when I think I can get away with it . Two , they murdered Jelly Jordan because he stumbled across them while they were trying to sabotage the Ferris wheel . Three , they wo n't give up ; they 'll be back to finish the job on the wheel , and if we do n't stop them , something terrible is going to happen here later in the week . " " Is that right ? " " You know it is . You left the pass to the Ferris wheel in my bedroom . " " I did ? " " For Christ 's sake there 's no reason to be so cautious of me ! " I said impatiently . " We 've both got the power . We should be allies ! " He raised one eye , and the orange eye above it had to squint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower orbs . I said , " Of all the fortune-tellers and palm readers and psychics that I 've known in other carnivals , you 're the first person I 've ever met who actually has some ESP . " " I do ? " " And you 're the only one I 've ever known who sees the goblins the way I do . " " Do I ? " " You must . " " Must I ? " " God , you can be infuriating . " " Can I ? " " I 've been thinking about it . I know you saw what hap/penal at the Dodgem Car pavilion and took care of the body- " " Body ? " "  --  and then tried to warn me about the Ferris wheel in case I did n't sense the trouble coming . You had some doubts when Jelly was found dead . You wondered if maybe I was just a psychopath , because you knew Jelly was n't a goblin . But you did n't accuse me ; you decided to wait and watch . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things up between us . To get it out in the open . So you 'll know for sure that I see them , that I hate them , and then we can work together to stop them . We 've got to prevent them from doing whatever they have planned at the Ferris wheel . I 've been over there this morning , getting a feel for the emanations pouring from it , and I 'm sure nothing 's going to happen today . But tomorrow or Friday ... " He just stared at me . " Damn it , " I said , " why do you insist on being so goddamnedenigmatic ? " " I 'm not being enigmatic , " he said . " You are . " " No , I 'm just being dumbfounded . " " Huh ? " " Dumbfounded . Because , Carl Slim , this is the most amazingconversation I 've ever had in my life , and I have n't understood a thing you 've said . " I sensed that he was in emotional turmoil , and perhaps a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just could not believe that he was completely baffled by what I had told him . I stared at him . He stared at me . I said , " Infuriating . " He said , " Oh , I get it . " " What ? " " This is some sort of joke . " " Jesus . " " Some elaborate joke . " " If you did n't want me to know you were here , if you did n't want me to know I was n't alone , then why did you help me dispose of the body ? " " Well , I guess , partly because it 's a hobby . " " What are you talking about ? "  | " Disposing of bodies , " he said . " It 's a hobby . Some people collect postage stamps , and some people build model airplanes , and I dispose of bodies whenever I find them . " I shook my head in dismay . " And partly , " he said , " it 's because I 'm such a neat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no litter worse than a decomposing body . Especially a goblin body . So whenever I find one , I clean up the mess and  --  " " It is n't a joke ! " I said , patience lost . He blinked all three eyes . " Well , it 's either a joke or you 're a deeply disturbed young man , Carl Slim . So far I 've liked you , liked you too much to want to believe you 're crazy , so if it 's all right with you , I 'll just figure it 's a joke . " I turned from him and stalked away , to the corner of the tent and around it , out to the concourse . What the hell was his game ? The storm had wrung the worst of the humidity out of the air , and the muggy August heat did not return with the blue sky . The day was warm and dry , with the sweet , clean tang of the mountains that surrounded the fairgrounds , and when the gates opened at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to see until the weekend . The carnival , a fantastic loom , used exotic sights and smells and sounds to weave a dazzling fabric that entranced the marks , a familiar and supremely comfortable fabric that we carnies drew around ourselves with joy and relief after two days of rain , after the death of our patch . The threads of sound included calliope music , " The Stripper " by David Rose blasting out of speakers at one of the kootch shows , the roar of the daredevil 's motorcycle on the " wooden wall of death , " the whistle-shriek-roar of the rides , the swish of compressed air that whirled the metal baskets of the Tip Top , diesels running full blast , the ten-in-one talker pitching the tip , laughing men and women , shouting and giggling children , and pitchmen everywhere saying , " Tell ya what I 'm gon na do ! " Filaments of scents , threads of odors , were worked through the shuttle , plated on the loom : cook-house grease , hot popcorn , hot unshelled peanuts , diesel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fragrantly steaming vats in the candy-apple stands . Sounds and smells were thep194texture of the carnival cloth , but the sights were the dyes that gave it brilliant color : the unpainted , burnished steel of the Dive Bomber 's egg-shaped capsules , upon which sunlight seemed to melt and spread in shimmering silver films of mercury ; the whirling red baskets of the Tip Top ; the sparklingsequins and shimmering beads and glimmering spangles on the costumes of the girlie show performers who paraded on the bally platforms with only tantalizing promises of the charms to be revealed within the tents ; the red , blue , orange , yellow , white , and green pennants flapping in the breeze like the wings of a thousand tethered parrots ; the giant , laughing face of the fun-house clown , nose still yellow ; the pumpingspinningbrass of the carousel poles . This magic carnival coat was a rainbow garment with many mysterious pockets , of flamboyant cut and design ; when you put it on , you slipped your arms through a sense of immortality , as well , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks and many of the other carnies , I could not escape all of my worries in the razzle-dazzle of the show , for I kept waiting for the first goblins to appear on the concourse . But the afternoon melted into evening , and the evening gave way to night , and none of the demonkind appeared . I was neither relieved nor pleased by their absence . Yontsdown was a nest , a breeding ground , and there should have been more of them on the midway than usual . I knew why they had stayed away . They were waiting for the real fun later in the week . Tonight , no tragedy was scheduled , no pageant of blood and death , so they were waiting until tomorrow or the day after . Then they would appear by the score , by the hundred , eager for a ringside seat at the Ferris wheel . If they had their way , the wheel would probably experience " mechanicalfailure " that would cause it either to topple or to collapse , and it was when this event was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair . That night , after the marks were gone , the midway lights were extinguished except for the bulbs on the merry-goround , where the carnies gathered to pay their last respects to Jelly Jordan . Hundreds of us encircled the ride ; those in the front rows were limned by amber and red light that , under the circumstances , was reminiscent of the candle-glow and stained/glass luminosity in a cathedral , while those who were farther back in this makeshift open-air nave either stood in reverent shadows or mourning darkness . Some stood on nearby rides , and some had climbed onto the tops of trucks parked along the center of the midway . All were silent , as they had been Monday morning , when the body had first been found . The urn containing Jelly 's ashes was placed on one of the benches , with mermaids standing an honor guard on both sides and with a cortege of proudly posed horses both in front of and behind the bier . Arturo Sombra started the engine that put the carousel in motion , though he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around in silence , Cash Dooley read selected paragraphs from " Piper at the Gates of Dawn , " a chapter from Kenneth Grahame 's The Wind in the Willows , which was what Jelly had requested in his will . Then the merry-go-round motor was stilled . The horses glided slowly to a full stop . The lights were turned off . We went home , and so did Jelly Jordan . Rya went instantly to sleep , but I could not . I lay awake , wondering about Joel Tuck , worrying about the Ferris wheel and the vision of Rya 's bloodied face , concerned about the schemes in which the goblins might even now be engaged . As the night dragged on , I cursed my Twilight Eyes . There are moments when I wish I 'd been born without psychic powers , especially without the ability to see the goblins . Sometimes nothing seems sweeter than the perfect ignorance with which other people mingle with the demonkind . Maybe it is better not to know that the beasts are among us . Better than to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outnumbered . Ignorance would , at least , be good medicine for insomnia . Except , of course , if I could not see goblins , I would already be dead , a victim of my Uncle Denton 's sadistic games . Uncle Denton . The time has come to talk of treachery , of a goblin masqueradingas human in the midst of my own family , wearing a disguise so perfect that not even the sharp blade of an axp196was able to carve away the false persona and reveal the monster within . My father 's sister , Aunt Paula , had first married Charlie Forster , and together they had brought a son , Kerry , into the world , the same year and month that my folks had delivered me . But Charlie died of cancer , a sort of goblin of his own that had devoured him from within , and he was laid in the ground when both Kerry and I were three years old . Aunt Paula remained single for ten years , raising Kerry on her own . But then Denton Harkenfield had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live all her days as a widow . Denton was a stranger to the valley , not even an Oregonian , hailing from Oklahoma ( or so he said ) , but everyone accepted him with remarkable alacrity , considering that thirdgenerationvalley people were often called " new folks " by the majority who could trace their roots back to the settlement of the Northwest . Denton was handsome , soft-spoken , polite , modest , quick to laugh , a born storyteller with an apparently limitless fund of amusing anecdotes and interesting experiences . He was a man of simple tastes , with no pretensions . Though he seemed to have money , he did not flaunt it or act as if money made him any better than the next Joe . Everyone liked him . Everyone but me . As a child , I 'd not been able to see the goblins clearly , though I knew they were different from other people . Occasionally  --  although not often in rural Oregon  --  I encounteredsomeone who had a strange fuzziness about him , a darksmoky-curlingshape within , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not understand why . However , as puberty began to change my hormonal balance and metabolism , I began to see the goblins more clearly , as vaguely defined demons at first , then in all their malevolent detail . By the time Denton Harkenfield came in from Oklahoma  --  or Hell  --  I was just beginning to be able to discern that the smoky spirit within these people was not merely a mysterious new form of psychic energy but an actual being , a demon or alien puppet master or creature unknown . In the months that Denton courted my Aunt Paula , my ability to perceive the hidden goblin improved steadily until , by the week of the wedding , I was in a panic at the thought of her marrying suchp197a beast . Yet there seemed to be nothing that I could do to prevent it . Everyone else thought Paula was an exceedingly fortunate woman to have found a man as universally well liked and admired as Denton Harkenfield . Even Kerry , my favorite cousin and best friend , would listen to no word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over even before Paula 's heart had been captured , and who had promised to adopt him . My family knew that I was clairvoyant , and my premonitionsand psychic insights were taken seriously . Once , when Mom had to fly back to Indiana to attend the funeral of her sister , I received distressing emanations from her airline ticket and was convinced that her plane would crash . I made such a fuss that she canceled at the last minute and booked a differentflight . In fact , the first plane did not crash , but there was a small fire aboard in midair ; many passengers were overcomeby smoke , and three were asphixiated before the pilot managed to land . I can not say for sure that my mother would have been a fourth victim if she had been aboard , but when I touched her ticket , I felt not paper but the cold , hard brass of a coffin handle . However , I had never told anyone about seeing smoky , curling shapes in some people . For one thing , I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I had sensed from the start that I would be in terrible danger if one of those people with the darkness inside was to discover that I was aware of his difference . It was my secret . By the week of Aunt Paula 's wedding , when I finally could see every sickening detail of the porcine-canine goblin in Mr. Denton Harkenfield , I could not just suddenly start babbling about monsters masquerading as human beings ; it would not be credible . You see , though the accuracy and validity of my occasional clairvoyant visions had been established , there were many who did not view my unusual talents as a blessing . My powers , though seldom mentioned or employed , marked me as " strange , " and there were those in our valley who believed that seers were invariably mentally unstable . More than a few people had told my parents that I should be watched closely for signs of delusional behavior or incipient autism , and although my parents had no patience with such talk , I was sure they sometimes worried that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link between psychicp198ability and mental instability is such a strong part of folklore that even my grandmother , who believed my Twilight Eyes were an unmixed and joyous blessing , worried that I would somehow lose control of the power , that it would turn in upon me and lead me to destruction . Therefore I was afraid that if I began ranting about goblins hidden inside human forms , I would reinforce the fears of those who were sure I would one day wind up in a padded room . Indeed I had doubts about my own sanity . I knew the folklore , and I had overheard some of the warnings my parents had been given , and when I began to see the goblins , I wondered if my mind had begun to fail me . Furthermore , while I feared the goblin in Denton Harkenfield and sensed the intense hatred that motivated the creature , I had no concrete evidence that it intended to harm Aunt Paula , Kerry , or anyone else . Denton Harkenfield 's behavior had been exemplary . And , finally , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  as would inevitably be the case  --  I would have done nothing but alert Uncle Denton to the danger that I posed to his kind . If I was not hallucinating , if he was a deadly beast , the last thing I wanted to do was call attention to myself , put myself in a position where I stood alone and defenseless , to be murdered at his leisure . The wedding was held , and Denton adopted Kerry , and for months Paula and Kerry were happier than anyone had ever seen them . The goblin remained in Denton , but I began to wonder if it was in essence an evil creature or merely .. . different from us . While the Harkenfield family prospered , an unusual amount of tragedy and disaster was visited upon many of their neighborsin that Siskiyou valley , but it took me a long time to realize that Uncle Denton was the source of this uncanny run of bad luck . The Whitborn family , half a mile from us , a mile from the Harkenfield place , were burned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the six Whitborn children , three perished in the fire . A few months later , out on Goshawkan Lane , all but one of the five members of the Jenerette family died of carbon monoxide poisoning when a vent on their furnace became inexplicably clogged , filling the house with deadly fumes in the middle of the night . And Rebecca Norfron , the thirteen-year-old daughter of Miles and Hannah Norfron , disappeared while on a walk with her littlep199dog , Hoppy ; she turned up a week later , over at the county seat , twenty miles away , in an abandoned house ; not only had she been killed but also tortured , and at length . Hoppy was never found . Then trouble moved closer to home . My grandmother fell down the cellar stairs at her place , broke her neck , and lay undiscovered for almost a day . I did not go into Grandma 's house after her death , which probably delayed my discovery that Denton Harkenfield was the source of many of the valleys ' miseries ; if I had stood at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom to kneel at the spot where they had found Grandma 's body , I would have sensed Uncle Denton 's contribution to her demise , and perhaps I could have stopped him before he caused more pain . At Grandmother Stanfeuss 's funeral , with her body three days dead and its invisible robes of psychic energy therefore somewhat depleted , I was nonethelessso afflicted with clairvoyant perceptions of unspecific violence that I collapsed and had to be taken home . They thought it was grief that brought me down , but it was the shocking knowledge that somehow Grandma had been murderedand had died in terror . But I did not know who had killed her , and I did not even have a shred of evidence to suggest that murder had been done , and I was only fourteen , an age when no one listens to you , and I was already consideredstrange , so I kept my mouth shut . I knew Uncle Denton was something more  --  or less  --  than human , but I did not immediately suspect him of murder . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved him so much and because he was nice to me , always making jokes with me and showing what seemed to be a genuine interest in my achievements at school and on the junior varsity wrestling team . He and Aunt Paula gave me wonderful Christmas presents , and on my birthday he gave me several novels by Robert Heinlein and A. E. van Vogt plus a crisp new five-dollar bill . I had seen him do nothing but good , and although I sensed that he virtually seethed with hatred , I wondered whether I was imagining the rage and loathing that I perceived within him . If an ordinary human being had been committing wholesale slaughter , a psychic residue of that villainy would have clung to him , and I would have detected it sooner or later , but goblins radiate nothing but hatred , and because I perceived no specific guilt in Unclep200Denton 's aura , I did not suspect that he was my grandmother 's killer . I did notice that when anyone died , Denton spent more time visiting at the funeral parlor than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was always solicitous , sympathetic , providing the most convenient shoulder to cry on , running errands for the bereaved , helping in any way he could , and he usually paid frequent visits to survivors after their loved ones had been buried , just to see how they were getting along and to inquire if there was any favor he could perform . He was widely lauded for his empathy , humanity , and charity , but he modestly turned aside such praise . This only confused me the more . It was especially confusing when I could see the goblin within him , which invariably grinned most wickedly on those occasions of grief and even seemed to take sustenance from the misery of the mourners . Which was the true Uncle Denton : the gloating beast within or the good neighbor and concerned friend ? I still had not arrived at an answer to that question when eight months later my father was crushed to death beneath his John Deere tractor . He had been using the tractor to pull up large stones in the new field that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our house and barn by an intruding arm of the forest that reached down from the Siskiyous . My sisters found him when they went to see why he had not come to the house at dinnertime , and I did not find out about it until I came home from a wrestling match at school a couple of hours later . ( " Oh , Carl , " my sister Jenny had said to me , hugging me tight , " his poor face , his poor face , all black and dead , his poor face ! " ) By then Aunt Paula and Uncle Denton were at our place , and he was the rock to which my mother and sisters clung . He tried to comfort me as well , and he seemed sincere in both his grief and his offer of sympathy , but I could see the goblin leering within and fixing me with hot , red eyes . Although I half believed that the hidden demon was a figure of my imagination or even proof of my growing madness , I nevertheless withdrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first the county sheriff was suspicious of the death , for there seemed to be wounds on my father that could not be explained by the toppling of the tractor . But as no one had a motive for murdering my dad , and as there was no other evidence whatsoever to point toward foul play , the sheriffp201eventually arrived at the conclusion that Dad had not been killed immediately when the tractor fell over on him , that he had struggled for some time , and that his other injuries resultedfrom those struggles . At the funeral I fell down in a swoon , as I had done at the services for my grandmother the previous year , and for the same reason : A punishing wave of psychic energy , a formless surging tide of violence smashed over me , and I knew that my father had been murdered , too , but I did not know why or by whom . Two months later I finally found the courage to go to the field where Dad had had his accident . There I moved inexorablytoward the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when I knelt on the earth that had received his blood , I had a vision of Uncle Denton striking him along the side of the head with a length of pipe , knocking him unconscious , then rolling the tractor on top of him . My father had regained consciousness and had lived five minutes , strainingagainst the weight of the tractor , while Denton Harkenfield had stood over him , watching , enjoying . The horror of it overwhelmed me , and I passed out , waking some minutes later with a bad headache and hands squeezed tightly around clumps of moist earth . I spent the next couple of months in secret detective work . My grandmother 's house was sold soon after her death , but I returned there when the new owners were away , and I let myself in through a basement window that I knew had no latch . When I stood at the foot and then at the head of the cellar steps , I received vague but unmistakable psychic impressionsthat convinced me Denton had pushed her and then had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall had not done the job as planned . I began to think about the unusually long run of misfortune that people in our valley had experienced for the past couple of years . I visited the rubble-strewn site of the fire-blasted Whitborn place where three children had succumbed to flames , and while the people who had purchased the old Jenrette house were away , I let myself into their place and laid my hands upon the furnace that had spewed killing fumes , and in both instances I receivedstrong clairvoyant impressions of Denton Harkenfield 's involvement . When Mom went into the county seat one Saturdayto do some shopping , I rode along with her , and while she visited several stores I went to the abandoned house where Rebecca Norfron 's tortured and mutilated corpse hadp202been discovered . There , too , the stain of Denton Harkenfield was visible to the psychic eye . For all of that , I had no evidence whatsoever . My tale of goblins would be no more believable now than when I had first recognized Denton Harkenfield for what he was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him without having the means to insure his arrest , I would certainly be the next " accident " victim in the valley . I had to have proof , and I hoped to obtain it by anticipating him with a precognitive flash of his next crime . If I knew where he would strike , I could be there to interrupt him in some dramatic fashion , after which his intended victim  --  spared only by my intervention  --  would testify against him , and he would be put in prison . I dreaded such a confrontation , afraid that I would botch it and wind up dead alongside the victim I had meant to save , but I could see no hope in any other course of action . I began spending more time around Uncle Denton , though his dual identity was terrifying and repellent , for I thought that I was more likely to receive the precognitive flash in his company than away from him . But to my surprise a year passed without developments of the sort I was hoping for . I did sense violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I received no visions of slaughter to come , and each time that his rage and hatred seemed to have reached an unusually fierce strength , each time that it seemed he must strike out to relieve the pressure in him , he would go away on some piece of business or on a short vacation with Aunt Paula , and he would always return in a more stable condition , the hatred and rage still in him but temporarily weakened . I suspected that he was causing suffering wherever he went , wary of spreading an inordinant amount of misery too close to home . I could not obtain a clairvoyant vision of these crimes while in his company because , until he arrived at wherever he was going and looked over the opportunities for destruction , he did not know , himself , where he would land a blow . Then , after our valley had known a year of peace , I began to sense that Denton intended to bring the war back to the original battleground . Worse , I perceived that he intended to kill Kerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he had given his name . If the goblin in him fed on human anguish , which I was beginning to suspect , it would enjoy a feast of surpassing richness in the aftermath of Kerry 's death . Aunt Paula , having lost a husband years before and being deeplyp203attached to her son , would be destroyed by the loss of Kerry  --  and the goblin would be with her not just in funeral parlors but twenty-four hours a day , seven days a week , drinking of her agony and despair . As the goblin 's hatred became more bitter day by day , as portents of impending violence grew increasingly obvious to my sixth sense , I became frantic , for I could not perceive the place , time , or method of the murder to come . The night before it happened , late last April , I awoke from a nightmare in which Kerry had been dying in the Siskiyou forests , under towering spruce and pine . In the dream he was wandering in circles , lost , dying of exposure , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hot chocolate , but for some reason he did not see or hear me , . and in spite of his weakness he managed to keep ahead of me , until I awoke not in a state of sheer terror but in frustration . I could not use my sixth sense to wring any more details from the ether , but in the morning I went to the Harkenfield place to alert Kerry to the danger . I was not sure how to lead into the subject and present my information convincingly , but I knew I must warn him immediately . On the way I must have considered and rejected a hundred approaches . However , when I got there , no one was home . I waited around for a couple of hours , and finally I headed back to our place , figuring I would return later , toward suppertime . I never saw Kerry again  --  alive . Late that afternoon the word reached us that Uncle Denton and Aunt Paula were worried about Kerry . That morning , after Aunt Paula had driven in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had told Denton that he was going into the mountains , into the woods back of their place , to do a little off-season small-game hunting , and he had said he would return by two o'clock at the latest . At least that was what Denton claimed . By five o'clock there was still no sign of Kerry . I expected the worst because it just was not like my cousin to hunt off-season . I did not believe that he had told Denton any such thing or that he had gone up into the Siskiyous by himself . Denton had lured him there on one pretext or another and then had . . . disposed of him . Search parties combed the foothills most of that night , without success . At first light they went out in greater force , with a pack of bloodhounds and with me . I had never before used my clairvoyance in a search of that kind . Because Ip204could not control the power , I did not think I would be able to sense anything of value , and I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abilities to bear . To my surprise , in two hours , ahead of the hounds , I experienced a series of psychic flashes and found the corpse at the head of a deep and narrow draw , at the foot of a rocky slope . Kerry was so badly battered that it was difficult to believe he had sustained all his injuries in the fall down the side of the ravine . Under other circumstances the county coroner might have found more than sufficient evidence to warrant a determination of death at the hands of another , but the corpse was in no condition to support the subtle analyses of forensic pathology , especially as practiced by a simple country physician . During the night , animals  --  raccoons , perhaps , or foxes , or wood rats , or weasels  --  had gotten at the body . Something had eaten the eyes , and something had burrowed into Kerry 's guts ; his face was slashed , and the tips of some fingers were nibbled off . A few days later I went after Uncle Denton with an ax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember my agonizingdoubts . But I swung the ax in spite of my reservations , driven by an instinctive awareness of how quickly and gleefullyhe would destroy me if I showed the slightest weakness or hesitation . What I remember most clearly is how that weapon felt in my hands as I used it on him : It felt like justice . I do not remember returning from the Harkenfield place to our house . One moment I was standing over Denton 's corpse , then suddenly I was in the shadow of the brewer 's spruce at the Stanfeuss farmhouse , cleaning the bloody blade of the ax on an old rag . Coming out of my trance , I dropped the ax and the rag and slowly became aware that the fields would soon need tilling , that the foothills would soon be green and beautifullydressed in the raiments of spring , that the Siskiyous looked more majestic than usual , and that the sky was a piercingly clear and aching shade of blue , except toward the west , where dark and ominous thunderheads were rapidly moving in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward me , I knew , without resort to my clairvoyant powers , that I was probably looking upon that treasured landscape for the last time . The incoming clouds were an omen of the stormy and sunless future I had hewn forp205myself when I had gone after Denton Harkenfield with that well-sharpened blade . And now , four months and thousands of miles from those events , lying next to Rya Raines in the darkness of her bedroom , listening to her even breathing as she slept , I was compelled to ride the memory train all the way to the end of the line before I could get off . With uncontrollable shudders and a thin , cold sweat , I relived the last hour at home in Oregon : the hurried packing of my knapsack , my mother 's frightened questions , my refusal to tell her what trouble I had gotten myself into , the mixture of love and fear in the eyes of my sisters , the way they longed to embrace and soothe me but drew back at the sight of the blood on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling them about the goblins ; even if they believed me , there was nothing they could do , and I did not want to burden them with my crusade against the demonkind , for already I had begun to suspect that inevitablyit would become just that , a crusade . So I had walked away , hours before Denton Harkenfield 's body would be found , and later I had sent my mother and sisters a letter with vague assertions of Denton 's involvement in the deaths of my father and Kerry . The last stop on the memory train is in some ways the worst : Mom , Jenny , and Sarah , standing on the front porch , watching me walk away , all of them weeping , confused , frightened , afraid for me , afraid of me , left on their own in a world grown cold and bleak . End of the line . Thank God . Exhausted but curiously cleansed by the journey , I turned onto my side , facing Rya , and fell into a deep sleep that was , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning , over breakfast , feeling guilty about all the secrets I was keeping from her and looking for a way to lead into a warning about the unknown threat she faced , I told Rya about my Twilight Eyes . I did not mention my ability to see the goblins but spoke only of my other psychic talents , specificallyof my clairvoyant ability to sense oncoming danger . I told her of my mother 's airline ticket that had felt not like paper but like the brass handle of a coffin , and I recounted other less dramatic instances of accurate premonition . That was enough for openers ; if I had piled on stories of goblinsp206hiding in human disguises , it would have been too rich a confection to inspire belief . To my surprise and gratification she had far less difficulty accepting what I told her than I had anticipated . At first her hands kept returning to her coffee mug and she sipped nervouslyat that brew , as if , by its heat and slight bitterness , it was a touchstone with which she could repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But before long she became enthralled by my stories , and it was soon evident that she believed . " I knew there was something special about you , " she said . " Did n't I say so just the other night ? That was n't just mushy love talk , you know . I meant that I really did sense something special . . . something unique and unusual in you . And I was right ! " She had scores of questions , and I answered them as best I could , while avoiding any mention of the goblins or of DentonHarkenfield 's murderous spree in Oregon , lest her belief collapse . In her reaction to my revelations , I sensed both wonder and what I thought was a dark dread , though that second emotion was less clear than the first . She openly expressed the wonder , but she tried to hide her dismay from me , and she managed to conceal it with such success that , in spite of my psychic perceptions , I was not sure that I was not imagining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took her hands in mine , and said , " I have a reason for telling you about all this . " " What ? " But first , I 've got to know whether you really want to ... " Want to what ? " " Live , " I said quietly . " Last week . . . you talked about the ocean down in Florida , about swimming out and out until your arms turned to lead ... " With too little conviction she said , " That was just talk . " " And four nights ago , when we climbed the Ferris wheel , you almost seemed to want the lightning to catch you there on the girders . " She turned her eyes away from mine , looked down at the yellow smears of egg yolk and the toast crumbs on her plate , said nothing . With love that must have been as evident in my voice as Luke Bendingo 's stutter was evident in his , I said , " Rya , there is a certain . . . strangeness in you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " Since you told me about Abner Kady and your mother , I 've begun to understand why darkness falls over you at times . But understanding does n't make me worry any less about it . " " There 's no need for you to worry , " she said softly . " Look in my eyes and tell me . " She took a long time in lifting her gaze from the remnants of her breakfast , but she met my eyes forthrightly when she said , " I have these . . . spells . . . these depressions . . . and sometimes it seems that going on is just too difficult . But I 'll never give in to those moods entirely . Oh , I 'll never . . . do away with myself . You do n't have to worry about that . I 'll always pull myself out of those funks and go on because I 've got two damned good reasons not to give up . If I gave up , Abner Kady would win , would n't he ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to go on , build up my little empire , and make something of myself , because every day that I go on and every success I have is a triumph over him , is n't it ? " " Yes . And what 's your other reason ? " " You , " she said . I had hoped that would be her answer . She said , " Since you 've come into my life I 've got a second reason to go on . " I lifted her hands , kissed them . Although she appeared relatively calm  --  if teary  --  on the surface , she was in an emotional turmoil of which I could make little sense . I said , " All right . We 've got something together that 's worth living for , and the worst thing that could happen now is that we 'd somehow lose each other . So . . . I do n't want to scare you . . . but I have had a . . . a sort of premonition ... that worries me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her lovely face darkened . " Is it . . . really bad ? " " No , no , " I lied . " It 's just that . . . I vaguely sense some trouble heading your way , so I want you to be careful when I 'm not with you . Do n't take any chances or risks  --  " " What sort of chances ? What kind of risks ? " " Oh , I do n't know , " I said . " Do n't climb up high anywhere , certainly not up the Ferris wheel again , until I 've sensed that the crisis is past . Do n't drive too fast . Be careful.  |p208Be  alert . It 's probably nothing . I 'm probably being a nervous nellie because you 're so valuable to me . But it wo n't hurt you to be more alert for a few days , until I have a clearer premonition or until I sense that the danger is past . Okay ? " " Okay . " I did not tell her about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood , for I did not want to terrify her . That would not accomplish anything and might even contribute to the danger she faced , for exhausted by prolonged and constant terror , she would not think instinctively or well when the crisis finally came . I wanted her to be cautious , not constantly afraid , and when we walked up to the midway a short while later and parted with a kiss , I felt that she was in approximately that desired state of mind . The August sun rained golden light upon the carnival , and birds sailed in a serene blue sky . As I prepared the highstrikerfor business my spirits rose steadily , until it seemed that I could take flight and join the birds above if I so desired . Rya had revealed her secret shame and the horror of her Appalachian childhood , and I had told her the secret of my Twilight Eyes , and in this sharing of long-guarded confidences , we had created an important bond ; neither of us was alone any more . I was confident that she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orphanage , and when she had done that , I might test her trust in me with hints about the goblins . I strongly suspected that , given more time with me , she would one day be able to accept my goblin tales as the truth , even though she did not have the ability to see the creatures and confirm - my testimony . Certainly there were still problems ahead : the enigmatic Joel Tuck ; the goblins ' scheme involving the Ferris wheel , which might or might not be the same danger that hung over Rya ; and our very presence in Yontsdown , with its abundant demonkind in positions of power from which they could cause us unguessable misery . Nevertheless , for the first time I was confident that I would triumph , that I would be able to avert the disaster at the Ferris wheel , that I would be able to save Rya , and that my life was , at last , on an upward track . It is always lightest just before the dark.  |p209Throughout  the afternoon and early evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knot : pleasantly warm but not searingly hot , low humidity , a gentle breeze that cooled but never grew strong enough to cause problems with the tents , thousands of marks eager to part with their money , and no goblins . But it changed with nightfall . First I began to see goblins on the concourse . There were not many of them , only half a dozen , but the look of them , inside their disguises , was worse than usual . Their snouts seemed to quiver more obscenely , and their hot-coal eyes blazed more brightly than ever , with fevered hatred that exceededin intensity the malevolence with which they usually regarded us . I sensed that they had passed the boiling point and were engaged upon an errand of destruction that would vent some of the pressure that was building in them . Then my attention was drawn to the Ferris wheel , which began to undergo changes that were visible to no eyes but mine . Initially the enormous machine began to loom even bigger than it was , to rise up slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convey a false impression of its size . In my vision it rose and swelled until it was not only the dominating object in the carnival ( which it hadp210always been ) but a truly mountainous mechanism , a towering construct that would crush everyone on the midway if it toppled . By ten o'clock the hundreds of lights that outlined the wheel appeared to be losing power , growing dimmer by the minute , until at eleven o'clock the giant ride was totally dark . A part of me could see that the lights continued to blaze as before , and when I looked at the wheel out of the corner of my eye , in a sidelong glance , I could confirm its continued bright adornment , yet when I looked at it more directly , I saw only an ominously huge , portentously dark Ferris turning ponderously against a black sky , as if it were one of the mill wheels of Heaven  --  the one that relentlessly grinds out the flour of suffering and cruel misfortune . I knew what the vision meant . The disaster at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the groundwork for that tragedy would be laid soon , in the dead hours after the midway had closed . The half dozen goblins that I had seen were a commando team and would remain on the fairgroundsafter the midway shut down . I felt it , sensed it , knew it . When all the carnies had gone to bed , the demonkind would crawl out of their separate hiding places , join forces , and sabotage the ride , as they had meant to do on Sunday night , when they had been interrupted by Jelly Jordan . And then , tomorrow , death would visit some innocent fair-goers who were looking forward to a spin on the big wheel . By midnight the mammoth Ferris , seen through my TwilightEyes , was not only without lights but was like a great silent engine that produced and flung off a deeper darkness of its own . That was much the same cold and disquieting image I had had of it the first night I had come onto the Sombra Brothers lot , last week , in another town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply disturbing . The midway began winding down shortly before one o'clock , and contrary to my usual diligence and industry , I was among the first to shutter . I had closed the high-striker and bundled up the day 's receipts when I saw Marco passing by on the concourse . I called him over , persuaded him to take the cash to Rya in her trailer , along with the message that I had some important business to do and would be late . As strings and banks and panels of lights winked out from one end of the midway to the other , as flaps were pulled over tent entrances and snugged down , as the carnies drifted away singly and in small groups , I ambled as nonchalantly as pos/sible toward the center of the grounds and , when unobserved , dropped down and slid into the shadows beneath a truck . I lay there for ten minutes , where the sun had not been able to thrust its drying fingers during the last two days , and the dampness worked its way through my clothes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I had begun to notice the changes in the Ferris wheel . The last lights were extinguished . The last generators were switched off , died with a chug , a rattle . The last voices faded , were gone . I waited another minute or two , then eased out from beneath the truck , stood , listened , breathed , listened . After the cacophony of the carnival in motion , the silence of the carnival at rest was preternatural . Nothing . Not a tick . Not a scrape . Not a rustle . Carefully following a discreet route that led through those places where the night was further darkened by piles of shadows , I crept to the Tilt-a-Whirl , paused by the ramp that led up to the ride , and again listened intently . Once more I heard nothing . I stepped cautiously over the chain at the bottom of the ramp and went up to the platform in a crouch , so as not to present an obvious silhouette . The ramp was made of two-byfours , solidly constructed , and I was wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascended . But once I reached the platform , stealth was not as easily achieved ; there , hour after hour , day after day , the vibrations of the ride 's steel wheels passed through the rails and into the surrounding wood , with the result that creaks and squeaks nested like termites in every joint of the structure . The Tilt-a-Whirl platform sloped up toward the back , and on my way to the top of it , I remained close to the outside railing , where the floorboard joints were the tightest and protested the least . Nonetheless , my progress was accompanied by several sharp little sounds that were startlingly loud in the uncanny quiet of the deserted midway . I told myself that the goblins , if they heard at all , would interpret these indiscretions as the settling noises of inanimate objects , yet I winced and froze each time the wood cried out beneath my feet . In a few minutes I passed all the Tilt-a-Whirl cages , which resembled giant snails slumbering in the darkness , and came to the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crouched against the railing and looked out across the night-cloaked carnival . I had chosen that observationpost because I could see the base of the Ferris wheel , plus more of the midway than from any point on the ground , and also because I was practically invisible there . The night had taken a few bites out of the moon since last week . It was not as helpful as it had been when I had pursued the goblin to the Dodgem Car pavilion . On the other hand , the moon-shadows granted me the same comforting concealmentthat gave a sense of security to the goblins ; as much was gained as lost . And I had one advantage that was invaluable . I knew that they were here , but they were almost certainly unaware of my presence and could not know that I was stalking them . Forty tedious minutes passed before I heard one of the intruders leave its hiding place . Luck was with me , for the sound  --  a grating of metal on metal and a soft squeal of unoiled hinges  --  came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where trucks and unlit arc lamps and generators and other pieces of equipment were lined up along the middle of the midway , with rides on both sides . The protestation from the hinges was followed swiftly by movementthat caught my eye . A slab of darkness , one of a set of double doors on the back of a truck , swung open through the deeper darkness around it , and a man came out of the cargo hold with elaborate caution , twenty feet from me . A man to anyone else , he was a goblin to me , and the flesh prickled at the back of my neck . In this poor light I could not see much of the demon within the human form , but I had no difficulty finding its glowing crimson eyes . When the creature had studied the night and had satisfied itself that it was unobserved and in no danger , it turned back to the open cargo hold . I hesitated for a moment , wondering if it was going to call forth others of its kind from inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door shut . I stood , swung one leg over the railing , then the other , and was for an instant perched on the Tilt-a-Whirl 's balustrade , where the beast below could not have missed me if it had suddenly turned around . But it did not turn , and although it closed the door and slid the latch bolt home as quietly as it could , it made enough noise to cover my cat-footed leap to the ground . Without looking back toward the dense shadows where Ip213crouched , it moved off toward the Ferris wheel , which stood two hundred yards farther up the midway . I drew the knife from my boot and followed the demon . It moved with the utmost caution . So did I.It made hardly a sound . I made no sound at all . I caught up with it alongside another truck . The beast became aware of me only when I leapt on it , threw one arm around its neck , pulled its head back hard , and opened its throat with my blade . As I felt its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , and it fell as suddenly and limply as a marionette whose control cords had been severed . On the ground it twitched for a few seconds , raising its hands to its gaping throat , where blood jetted black as oil in the lightless night . It could make no sound , for it could not draw breath through its ruined windpipe or command a single vibration in its gouged larynx . In any event , it lived less than half a minute , relinquishing life with a series of feeble flutters . The radiant red eyes fixed on me , and as I watched , the light ebbed from them . Now he seemed like only a middle-aged man with bushy sideburns and a potbelly . I pushed the corpse under the truck , to prevent one of the other beasts from stumbling upon it and being tipped off to the danger . Later I would have to return , decapitate it , and dig two widely separated graves for the remains . Now , however , I had other worries . The odds had improved a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not heartening . I tried to kid myself that not all of the six I had seen on the concourse had stayed past closing time , but it was no good . I knew they were all nearby , as only I can know such things . My heart raced , overloading veins and arteries with a surge of blood that made me feel exceptionally clearheaded , not dizzy or frantic at all but sensitized to every subtle nuance of the night , much the way that a hunting fox must feel as it tracks prey in the wild and , at the same time , remains on guard for those things that regard the fox , himself , as prey . Under the half-devoured moon I prowled , a dripping knife in my hand , its blade glimmering like a magically coherent length of oily liquid . Snowflake moths air-danced around chrome poles and flit/ted back and forth across other faces of highly polished metal , wherever there was a vague reflection of waning moonlight . I stole from one bit of cover to another , listening , watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around blind corners . Crept . Crawled . Slid . Eased . A mosquito tickled across my throat on spindly legs , flimsy wings beating hard , and I almost swatted it before I realized the sound might give me away . Instead I closed a hand slowly over it as it began to feed on me  --  and crushed it between palm and neck . I thought I heard something over by the fun house , though it was most likely my sixth sense that sent me in that direction . The clown 's huge face seemed to wink at me in the gloom , though not with any humor ; it was , instead , the kind of wink that Death might favor you with when he came to collect your debt , a bleak wink simulated by the writhing of maggots in an empty eye socket . A goblin , having boarded a fun-house gondola before closingtime , and having cleverly disembarked from that gondola once inside the attraction , was now coming out of the enormousgaping mouth of the clown to keep a rendezvous with the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costumed as an Elvis look-alike , with a ducktail haircut and a swagger , about twenty-five . I observed it from the cover of the ticket booth  --  and as it passed me , I struck . This time I was not as quick or forceful as I had been before , and the beast managed to bring an arm up and deflect the blade as the cutting edge slashed toward its throat . The razored steel parted the flesh of its forearm and sliced along the back of its hand , the point coming to rest between the first knuckles of two fingers . The demon issued a thin , soft cry , barely audible , but choked that off when it realized that a scream might draw inquisitive carnies as well as other goblins . Even as blood sprang from its arm , the demon tore itself loose of me . It swung toward me with a lurch and stumble , its luminous eyes bright with murderous intention . Before it could regain its balance , I kicked it in the crotch . Trapped within the human form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now it doubled over asp215pain exploded up from its crushed testicles . I kicked again , higher this time , and the beast lowered its head simultaneously , as if to oblige me , and my foot caught it under the chin . It sprawled backward on the sawdust-covered concourse , and I fell atop it , driving my knife deep into its throat , twisting the blade . I took three or four blows on my head and shoulders as it made a futile attempt to drive me off , but I succeeded in letting the life out of the creature like air from a punctured balloon . Gasping but keeping in mind the need for silence , I pushed up from the dead goblin  --  and was struck from behind , across the base of the skull and the back of the neck . A manypetaledpain bloomed , but I held on to consciousness . I fell , rolled , and saw another demon scuttling toward me , a length of wood in its hands . I discovered that I had been so stunned by the first blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , gleaming dully , ten feet away , but I could not reach it in time . With its black lips drawn back in a wicked snarl beneath its human glaze , my third adversary was upon me in one blink of its conflagrant eyes , wielding that length of two-by-four as if it were an ax , chopping at my face as I had chopped at Denton Harkenfield . I crossed my arms over my head to save myself from a skull-fracturing blow , and the beast slammed the heavy club into my arms three times , striking hot bursts of pain from my bones the way a blacksmith 's hammer rings sparks from an anvil . Then it changed tactics and struck at my unprotected ribs . I drew up my knees and made a ball of myself and tried to roll away , toward some object that I might be able to put between us , but the goblin followed with evil glee , raining blows on my legs , buttocks , back , sides , andarms . None of them landed with bone-breaking force because I kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not take this punishment much longer and still have the will and ability to stay on the move ; I began to think that I was a dead man . In desperation I stopped trying to shield my head and grabbed for the club , but the demon , towering over me , glaring down at me , easily tore it out of my grasp , and I succeeded only in taking half a dozen splinters in my palms and fingers . The creature swept the bludgeon high above its head and brought it down with the fury of a berserker or a battle-frenzied samurai . Coming straight at me , the woodp216looked as big as a toppling tree , and I knew that this time it would knock either the sense or the life out of me -- but instead the weapon suddenly slipped out of the goblin'shands , flew off to the right of me , thumped end over end through the sawdust . And with a hard , low grunt of shock and pain , my attacker dropped toward me , felled by what seemed to be pure sorcery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beast , and when I looked back at it in bewilderment , I saw how I 'd been saved . Joel Tuck stood over the goblin , holding the same sledgehammer that he had been using Wednesday morning when I had found him pounding in tent pegs behind Shockville . Joel hammered once more , and the goblin 's skull collapsed with a thud and a wet , sickening sound . The entire battle had been waged in virtual silence . The loudest noise had been the thump of the wooden club striking one part of my anatomy or another , which could not have carried more than a hundred feet or so . Still racked with pain and thinking slowly on that account , I watched numbly as Joel let go of his hammer , grabbed the dead goblin by the feet , and dragged the corpse off the concourse , concealing it in the niche formed by the fun-house pitchman 's platform and the ticket booth . By the time he started wrestling the other body , the Elvis look-alike , into the same hiding place , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rub a little of the pain out of my arms and sides . As I watched him drag the second body behind the ticket booth to pile it upon the other , I had a darkly giddy moment in which I imagined Joel beside an enormous stone hearth , rocking in a comfortable chair , reading a good book , sipping brandy  --  and occasionally getting up to move another corpse from a huge stack of them , shoving it into the fireplace where other dead men and women were already half consumed by flames . Except for the fact that bodies had taken the place of ordinary logs , it was a warmly domestic scene , and Joel was even whistling happily as he jabbed an iron poker at the heap of burning flesh . I felt a wild giggle building in me , and I knew that I dare not give voice to it , for then I might never be able to stop cackling . The realization that I was on the edge of hysteria shocked and frightened me . I shook my head and banished that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd recuperated enough to try standing , Joel was there to help . In the eldritch light of the partial moon , hisp217malformed face looked not more monstrous than usual , as might be expected , but softer , less threatening , like a child 's amateurish drawing , almost more amusing than frightening . I leaned against him for a moment , reminded of how damned big he was , and when I finally spoke , I had the presence of mind to whisper , " I 'm okay . " Neither of us commented on his fortuitous appearance , nor did we make any reference to his willingness to commit murder in spite of the fact that he claimed never to have seen a goblin . There would be time for that later . If we survived . I hobbled across the concourse to retrieve my knife . Stoopingdown , I experienced a moment of dizziness , but I overcameit , plucked the knife out of the sawdust , rose again , and returned to Joel with that tongue-between-the-teeth , stiff-necked , square-shouldered , oh-so-careful posture and gait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a sobriety test . Joel was not deceived by my brave pretense . He took my arm , supported me as we got off the exposed concourse , and helped me scurry into the center of the midway . We took refuge in a haven of shadows by the Caterpillar . " Broken bones ? " he whispered . " Do n't think so . " " Bad cuts ? " " No , " I said as I scraped a couple of the biggest splinters out of my hands . I had escaped serious injury , but I would be sore as hell in the morning . If I made it to the morning . " There 're more goblins . " He was silent for a moment . We listened . From the distance came the forlorn whistle of a train . Closer , the quick and soft vibration of moth wings . Breathing . Ours . At last he whispered , " How many do you think ? " " Maybe six . " " Killed two , " he said . " Including the one I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three . " Like me , he had known they were going to sabotage the Ferris wheel tonight . Like me , he had set out to stop them . I wanted to hug him . " Killed two , " I whispered . " You ? "  | " Me . " " Then . . . one left ? " " I think . " " Want to go after it ? " " No . " " Oh ? " " Got to go after it . " " Right . " " The Ferris , " I hissed . We slipped along the cluttered midway until we were near the big wheel . In spite of his size , Joel Tuck moved with athletic grace and in complete silence . We stopped in a drift of shadows piled against a short trailer that contained a generator , and when I peered around the equipment , I saw the sixth goblin standing at the foot of the Ferris . It was disguised as a tall , rather muscular man of thirtyfive , with curly blond hair . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall of anemic moonlight covered it like talcum powder and revealed it much as powder might cling to and reveal an invisible man , I was able to see the goblin within , as well , even from a distance of thirty feet . Joel whispered , " It 's agitated . Wonders where the others are . Got to take it soon . . . before it gets scared and bolts . " We edged five feet closer to the demon , until we were huddled in the last bit of cover . To reach the goblin , we would have to leap up , revealing ourselves , dash twelve feet , vault over the low fence , and cross another twelve or fifteen feet of cable-strewn ground . Of course , by the time we were negotiating the fence , our enemy would have run for its life , and if we could not catch it , the beast would race back into Yontsdown to warn the others : There are people at the carnival who can see through our disguises ! Then Chief Lisle Kelsko would find an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come armed with fistsful of search warrants as well as guns , and he would poke his nose into not only the sideshows and kootch tents and hanky-panics but into our trailers as well . He would not be satisfied until the goblin killers were identified among the ordinary carnies and , by one means or another , eliminated . If , however , the sixth goblin could be cut down and secretlyburied with its companions , Kelsko might strongly suspect that someone at the carnival was responsible for theirdisappearance , but he would not have proof . And he mightp219not realize that the saboteurs had been destroyed because their human disguises had been penetrated . If this sixth goblin did not return to Yontsdown with an explicit warning and descriptionsof Joel and me , there was at least still hope . My right hand was damp with perspiration . I scrubbed it vigorously on my jeans , then gripped my throwing knife by the point . My arms ached from the beating I had taken , but I was pretty sure that I could still put a blade where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when the goblin turned away from me to survey the shadows in the other direction for its demonic compatriots , I stood up , took several quick steps , froze as it began to look in my direction once more , and loosed the knife with all the force and quickness and calculation of which I was capable . I had thrown a second too soon and too low . Before the creature could complete its turn in my direction , the blade sank deep into its shoulder instead of piercing the tender center of its throat . The demon staggered backward and collidedwith the ticket booth . I ran toward it , stumbled , fell over a cable , and hit the ground hard . By the time Joel reached the beast , it had pulled the knife from its shoulder and was reeling , though still on its feet . With a snarl and a snakelike hiss that definitely were not human , it slashed at Joel , but he was agile for his size , and he knocked the knife from its hand , shoved it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground . He strangled it . I retrieved my knife , wiped the blade on the leg of my pants , and returned it to the sheath in my boot . Even if I had been able to dispatch all six goblins without Joel 's help , I would not have had the strength to bury them by myself . As huge and well muscled as he was , he could drag two bodies at a time , while I could handle only one . I would have had to make six trips to the woods behind the fairgroundsif I had been alone , but the two of us needed to make the trek just twice . Furthermore , because of Joel , digging graves was not required . We dragged the bodies to a spot only twenty feet in from the perimeter of the forest . There , in a small glade surrounded by trees like black-frocked priests of a pagan religion , a limestone sinkhole waited to accept the dead.  |p220As  I knelt beside the hole , directing the beam of Joel 's flashlight into its apparently depthless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was here ? " " I always scout the territory when we set up at a new stand . If you can find something like this , it puts your mind at rest a little to know it 's available if you need it . " " You 're at war , too , " I said . " No . Not the way you seem to be . I only kill them when I have no other choice , when they 're going to murder carnies or when they intend to hurt marks on the lot and let us take the blame for it . I ca n't do anything about the misery they inflict on the marks out in the straight world . It 's not that I do n't care about the marks , you know . I do . But I 'm only one man , and I can only do so much , and the best I can hope to do is protect my own . " The trees around us rustled their leafy cassocks . A sepulchral odor wafted out of the sinkhole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked . " Only two . They usually let us alone in Yontsdown because they 're so busy planning school fires and poisoning folks at church picnics and that sort of thing . " " You know what a breeding ground this is ! " " Yes . " " When did you bury the others here ? " I asked , again peering down into the bottomless limestone shaft . " Two years ago . A couple of them came on the lot the next to last night of the engagement , intending to start a fire that 'd sweep through the whole midway and wipe us out . Much to their surprise , I interfered with their plans . " Hunched over , hair wild , his malformed face looking even stranger than usual in the back splash of the flashlight , the freak pulled the first corpse to the lip of the sinkhole , as if he were Grendel storing meat against the privations of winter . I said , " No . First . . . we 've got to cut off their heads . The bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be buried separately . . . just in case . " " Huh ? In case what ? " I told him about my experience with the goblin that he had buried under the floor of Shockville last week . " I 've never cut off their heads before , " he said . " Then there 's a chance that maybe a couple of them came back . " He let go of the body and stood in silence for a moment ,  |p221thinking  about that unsettling bit of news . Considering his size and the blood-freezing juxtaposition of his gnarly features , you might have thought that he could easily instill terror but never know fear himself . Yet even in that inadequatelight I could see the anxiety in his face and in his two good eyes , and when he spoke , it was in his voice as well . " You mean there could be a couple of them out there , somewhere , who know that I know about them . . . and maybe they 're looking for me . . . been looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Could be , " I said . " I suspect most of them stay dead once you kill them . Probably only a few retain a strong enough spark of life to rebuild their bodies and eventually reanimate themselves . " " Even a few is too many , " he said uneasily . I was now holding the flashlight in such a way that the beam sprayed across the top of the sinkhole , parallel with the ground , and painted the trunks of a couple of trees at the far side of the clearing . Joel Tuck looked down through the widening fan of light , at the yawning mouth of the shaft , as if he expected to see goblin hands reach out of that darkness , as if he thought his victims had come back to life long ago but had remained down there where he had put them , just waiting for him to return . He said , " I do n't think the two I dropped in here would 've come back . I did n't behead them , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a spark of life remained in them when I brought them here , the fall down that hole would surely have finished them for good . Besides , if they had ) come back , they would have warned others in Yontsdown , and the group who came to sabotage the Ferris wheel would 've been a hell of a lot more careful than they were . " Though the sinkhole seemed very deep , though he was most likely right about the inability of any goblin to come back from that cold , bottomless grave , we nevertheless decapitatedall six of the demons that we had slain that night . We consigned their bodies to the hole but buried their heads in a common grave much farther back in the woods . On the way back to the carnival , along the forest path , as we pushed through brambles and weeds , I was so weary that Ip222felt as if my bones were on the verge of coming unhinged . Joel Tuck seemed exhausted , too , and we did not have the energy or clarity of mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed answers . I did , however , want to know why he had played dumb on Wednesday morning , when I had interrupted him while he was pounding tent pegs and had confronted him with the fact that at our previous engagement he had buried the goblin for me . Paraphrasing the question that he had asked me about Rya almost a week ago , making an answer of it , he said , " Well , Carl Slim , at that time I was n't certain I had seen the underneathbelow your underneath . I knew there was a goblin killer in you , but I did n't know if that was your deepest secret . You seemed to be a friend . Any killer of goblins would seem to have the right stuff . Lord , yes ! But I 'm cautious . As a young child , I was not cautious about people , you see , but I learned . Oh , I learned ! As a little boy , I was desperate to be loved , made desperate by this nightmare face of mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to anyone who had a kind word for me . But one by one they all betrayed me . I heard some of them laughing at me behind my back , and in others I eventually detected a nauseating pity . Some trusted friends and guardians won my confidence , only to prove themselves unworthy of it when they tried to have me permanently institutionalized for my Own good ! By then I was eleven years old , and I knew that people had as many layers to them as onions , and that before  --  you made friends with someone you had better be sure that every layer of him was as clean and good as the top skin . You see ? " " I see . But what possible secret did you think I could be concealing under the secret of my goblin killing ? " " I did n't know . Could 've been anything . So I 've kept tabs on you . And tonight , when it looked like that bastard was going to do you in with the two-by-four , I had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good heavens ! " " But I realized that if I did n't act , I might be losing a friend and ally . And in this world , friends and allies of your sort are not easily acquired . " In the meadow between the forest and the midway , with the moon now gone , with the black arms of the night draped conspiratorially around our shoulders , we trudged in weary companionship , tall grass whispering around our legs . Fire/flies flickered on all sides of us and flitted by on lantern-lit missions beyond our understanding . Our passage brought a temporary halt to cricket songs and to the cries of field toads , but the chorus swelled again in our wake . As we neared the back of the big tent that housed Sabrina 's Mysteries of the Nile , a girlie show with an Egyptian gimmick , Joel stopped and put a big hand on my shoulder , stopping me as well . " There might be trouble tonight when those six do n't show up back in Yontsdown , as expected . Maybe you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . There 's an extra bedroom . " That was the first I knew he was married , and although I prided myself on having a carny 's blase attitude toward freaks and such , I was chagrined to discover that I was startled by the thought of someone married to Joel Tuck . " What do you say ? " he asked . " I doubt there 'll be any more trouble tonight . Besides , if there is , my place is with Rya . " He was silent a moment . Then : " I was right , was n't I ? " " About what ? " " Your infatuation . " " It 's more than that . " " You . . . love her ? " " Yes . " " Are you sure ? " " Yes . " " And are you sure you know the difference between love and infatuation ? " " What the hell kind of question is that ? " I demanded , not really angry with him , just frustrated , as I detected the resurgenceof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " You 're not an ordinary seventeen-yearold . You 're not a boy . No boy has learned and seen and done the things that you have , and I should n't forget that . You know what love is , I guess . You 're a man . " " I 'm ancient , " I said tiredly . " Does she love you ? " " Yes . " He was silent for a long time , but he kept his hand on my shoulder , staying me , as if he were diligently searching for words to convey an important message that defied even his formidable vocabulary . I said , " What is it ? What 's troubling you ? "  | " I guess , when you say that she loves you . . . this is something you know not just from what she says but from ... but also by the application of whatever special talents and perceptions you possess . " " That 's right , " I said , wondering why my relationship with Rya should cause him such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost like common nosiness , but I vaguely sensed that there was more to it , and besides , he had saved my life , so I stifled the first glimmer of irritation and said , " Clairvoyantly , psychically , I sense that she loves me . Does that satisfy you ? But even if I did n't have the advantage of my sixth sense , I would know how she felt . " " If you 're sure  --  " " I just said I was . " He sighed . " Again I 'm sorry . It 's just that . . . I have always been aware of a . . . a difference in Rya Raines . I 've had the feeling that the underneath below her underneath is ... not good . " " She has a grim secret , " I told him . " But it 's not somethingthat she 's done . It 's something that was done to her . " " She 's told you all ? " " Yes . " He nodded his shaggy head and worked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear it . I 've always sensed the good , worthy part of Rya , but there 's been this other thing , this unknown thing , that has aroused suspicion .... " " As I said , her secret is that she was a victim , not a criminal . " He patted my shoulder once , and we began to walk again , around the back of the kootch show , around Animal Oddities , between that tent and another , to the concourse , and from there to Gibtown-on-Wheels . I moved faster as we drew nearer the trailers . All the talk about Rya reminded me that she was in danger . Though I 'd warned her to be careful , though I knew she could probably take care of herself once she was aware that trouble was coming and could not then be blindsided by it , and though I did not sense she was in peril at this moment , a serpent of apprehension coiled in the pit of my stomach and I was eager to check on her . Joel and I parted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity about each other 's psychic abilities and to share what knowledge we had of the goblin race . Then I headed toward Rya 's Airstream , thinking of thep225night 's slaughter , hoping I was not too grossly smeared with blood , concocting a story to explain the stains on my jeans and T-shirt if Rya was awake and had an opportunity to see them . With luck , she would be in bed , and I could shower and dispose of my clothes while she dreamed . I felt almost as if I were the Grim Reaper himself , coming home from work . I did not know that before dawn this Reaper would need to use his scythe again.  |p226Rya  was sitting in an armchair in the living room of the Airstream , still dressed in the tan slacks and emerald-green blouse she had been wearing when I had last seen her on the midway . She held a glass of Scotch in one hand , and when I got a look at her face , I stopped three or four words into the deception that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it was visible in her eyes , in the tremor that softened her mouth , in the sooty rings that had appeared around her eyes , and in the paleness that aged her . " What is it ? " I asked . She motioned me to the chair that faced hers , and when I indicated the stains on my jeans  --  not too bad now that I saw them in the light  --  she said it did not matter and again directed me to the armchair , this time with a note of impatience . I sat , suddenly aware of the earth and blood on my hands , realizing that my face very likely had a smear or two of blood on it . Yet she seemed neither shocked nor curious about my appearance , uninterested in my whereabouts during the past three hours , which must be an indication of the seriousness of the news that she had for me . As I perched on the edge of the chair , she took a long pull on her Scotch . The glass rattled against her teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven , I killedp227Abner Kady , and they took me away from my mother . I already told you that . They put me in a state-run orphanage . I told you that too . But what I did n't tell you was that . . . when I went to the orphanage . . . that was where I first saw them . " I stared at her , uncomprehending . " Them , " she said . " They ran the place . They were in charge . The director , the assistant director , the head nurse , the doctor who did n't live in but was on twenty-four-hour call , the counselor , the majority of the teachers , almost the entire staff were their kind , and I was the only kid who could see them . " Stunned , I started to get up . With a gesture she indicated that I should remain where I was . She said , " There 's more . " " You see them too ! But this is incredible ! " " Not so incredible , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world for social outcasts , and who is more of an outcast than those of us who see . . . the others ? " " Goblins , " I said . " I call them goblins . " " I know . But is n't it logical that our kind would drift into the carnival . . . or into insane asylums . . . more than anywhere else ? " " Joel Tuck , " I said . She blinked in surprise . " He sees them too ? " " Yes . And I suspect he knows you see the goblins . " " But he 's never told me . " " Because he says he detects a darkness in you , and he 's a most careful man . " She finished her Scotch and then stared at the ice cubes in her glass for a long moment , bleaker than I had ever seen her . When I started to get up again , she said , " No . Stay there . Do n't come to me , Slim . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to be held . Not now . I 've got to finish this . " " All right . Go on . " She said , " I had never seen the . . . the goblins up in the Virginia hills . Were n't many people around , and we never went far from home , never saw any outsiders , so I was n't likely to encounter them . When I saw them in the orphanage for the first time , I was terrified , but I sensed I would be . . . eliminated . . . if I let them know I could see through their charade . With careful questioning and a lot of hinting , I soonp228learned that none of the other kids were aware of the beasts inside our keepers . " She raised the Scotch , remembered that she had finished the whiskey , and held the glass in her lap with both hands to keep them from shaking . " Can you understand what it was like to be helpless children at the mercy of those creatures ? Oh , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of dead or badly battered children would have brought an investigation . But the code of discipline allowed a lot of leeway for vigorous spankings and a wide variety of punishments . They were masters at psychological torture , as well , and they kept us in a constant state of fear and despair . They seemed to feed on our distress , on the psychic energy produced by our anguish . " I felt as if spicules of ice had formed in my blood . I longed to hold her , stroke her hair , and assure her that they would never get their filthy hands on her again , but I sensed that she was not finished yet and would not appreciate an interruption . She was almost whispering now . " But there was a worse fate than having to stay at the orphanage . Adoption . You see , I soon became aware that the couples who showed up to interview kids for adoption sometimes were both goblins , and no child was ever given to a family in which at least one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You get my drift ? You see ? You know - what was happening to those kids who were adopted ? In the privacy of their new families , beyond the eye of the state , which might have seen blatant wrongdoing in the orphanage , in the sanctity ' of the family where bad secrets are more easily kept , they were tortured , used as toys for the gratification of goblins that had taken custody of them . So while it was Hell in the orphanage , it was worse to be sent home with a couple of them . " The ice spread from my blood into my bones , where it seemed as if my marrow had frozen solid . " I avoided adoption by playing stupid , by pretending to have such a low IQ that torturing me would be no more fun than torturing a dumb animal . They want response , you see . That 's what thrills them . And I do n't mean just your physical response to the pain they inflict . That 's pretty much secondary . What they want is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to engender a satisfyingly complex terror in a dumb animal . So I avoided adoption , and when I was old enough and toughp229enough to be fairly sure of making it on my own , I ran away to the carnival . " " When you were fourteen . " " Yes . " " Old enough and tough enough , " I said with grim irony . " After eleven years of Abner Kady and three years under the thumb of the goblins , " she said , " I was as tough as you can get . " If her endurance , perseverance , strength , and courage had been awesome before , this new information provided a glimpse of bravery almost too great to be comprehended . I had found myself a special woman , all right , a woman whose determination to survive gave rise to reverent wonder . I slumped back in my chair , suddenly hammered limp by the horror that I had just heard . My mouth was dry and bitter , and my stomach was sour , and there was a great hollowness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ? Where do they come from ? Why.do they haunt the human race ? " " I know , " she said . For a moment I did not fully grasp the meaning of those two words . Then , when I saw that she literally meant that she knew the answers to my three questions , I came forward on my chair , breathless , electrified . " How do you know ? How did you find out ? " She stared down at her hands , unspeaking . " Rya ? " " They 're our creation , " she said . Startled , I said , " How can that possibly be true ? " " Well , you see . . . mankind has been on this world far longer than current wisdom has it . There was a civilization many thousands of years before ours . . . before written history , and it was even more advanced than ours . " " What do you mean ? A lost civilization ? " She nodded . " Lost . . . destroyed . War and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of that earlier civilization as it is for us now . Those nations developed nuclear weapons and reached a stalemate not unlike the one we 're approaching now . But that standoff did n't lead to an uneasy truce or to peace by necessity . Hell , no . No . Instead , stalemated , they searched for other means of waging warfare . " A part of me wondered how she could know these things , but I did not for a moment doubt the truth of what she said ,  |p230for  with my sixth sense  --  and perhaps with a wisp of racial memory buried deep in my subconscious  --  I perceived an ominousreality to what some listeners might have thought was only a crazy fantasy or fairy tale . I could not bear to interrupt her to ask again for the source of her information . For one thing , she did not seem ready to tell me . And for another thing , I was spellbound , compelled to attend the seafarer 's story , and she seemed equally obsessed with the need to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captivated by any wondrous fable , nor has any condemned man listened with more dread to the judge 's reading of his sentence than I felt as I listened to Rya Raines that night . " In time , " she continued , " they developed the ability to ... to tamper with the genetic structure of animals and plants . Not just tamper but edit , splice one gene to another , excise characteristics or add them at will . " " That 's science fiction . " " To us , yes . To them it was a reality . That breakthrough vastly improved people 's lives by insuring better crops .. . and a more stable food supply . . . and by creating a host of new medicines . But it also had great potential for evil . " " And that potential did n't go unexplored for long , " I said , not with clairvoyant insight but with a cynical surety that human nature had been no different  --  or better  --  tens of thousands of years ago than it was in our own age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for military purposes , the ultimate warrior for a slave army . " Picturing the grotesque demonkind , I said , " But what specificanimal did they alter to come up with this . . . this thing ? " " I do n't know exactly , but I think it 's not an altered version of anything so much as . . . an entirely new species on the face of the earth , a man-made race with intelligence equal to ours . As I understand it , the goblin is a being with two genetic patterns for every detail of physical appearance  --  one pattern essentially human and one not  --  plus a vital linking gene that bears the metamgrphic talent , so that the creature has the ability to choose between its two identities at will , to be  --  to all outward appearances , at least  --  a human being , or a goblin , whichever the moment seems to demand . " " But it 's not really a human being even when it looks like one of us , " I said.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
