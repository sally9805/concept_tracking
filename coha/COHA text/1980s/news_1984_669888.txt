WASHINGTON  --  House-Senate conferees cleared a huge catchall spending measure for fiscal 1985 as Congress lurched closer to adjournment . The long-awaited measure was completed after the Democratic-controlled House and the Republican-controlled Senate settled a handful of nettlesome issues , including the denial of military aid to Nicaraguan insurgents until next year at the earliest and the elimination of funds for new water projects . Quick House and Senate approval of the resolution was considered likely , and President Reagan , whose aides helped fashion the final package , is expected to sign it . The major remaining obstacle to congressional adjournment this week is final approval of a bill to raise the federal borrowing limit . Senate action on the measure is slated for today . To complete the $370 billion spending measure , each side relented in some matters dear to it . The Senate , in a major bow to the House , agreed to the compromise on the anti-Sandinista guerrillas . In exchange , the House agreed to eliminate almost $100 million of water projects , and other public works projects , over which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , both chambers passed and sent to the president a fiscal 1985 budget of more than $101. 4 billion for the Departments of Labor , Education and Health and Human Services . The measure , which is separate from the catchall spending bill , includes major increases in health research and aid to low-income college students . The measure covering the three departments represents the bulk of federal assistance to the aged and the poor . The National Institutes of Health would receive $1. 5 billion , or $650 million more than in fiscal 1984 . The maximum grant for low-income students would be increased to $2 , 100 from $1 , 900 currently . Sizable increases also were slated for the Headstart program , maternal and child health care and child welfare services . Under provisions of the catchall spending bill , both the House and the Senate would be required to cast affirmative votes before any military aid could be given to the Nicaraguan insurgent forces supported by the Reagan administration . The amount of aid would be limited to $14 million for six months . Nicaragua ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some critics had believed . In addition , the conferees agreed to include nonbinding legislation that would urge the president to refrain from committing combat troops to Central America . The Senate , at the president ' s urging , had voted $28 million in military aid for the insurgents . But since the disclosure last spring that the Central Intelligence Agency had helped mine Nicaraguan harbors , support for military aid among Democrats and Republicans has waned . Future support for the aid is uncertain , lawmakers concedes . The conferees also agreed to allocate $1. 4 billion for the space-based missile-defense program , known as " star wars " and to permit three tests of anti-satellite weapons systems next year . The conferees previously had discussed permitting two successful tests . The water projects , which the Reagan administration argued were costly giveaways , didn ' t go without a fight by Democrats and Republicans . Chairman Mark Hatfield , ( R. , Ore. ) of the Senate Appropriations Committee , who was forced to cut a water project for his own state , derided White House Budget Director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounted to " petty cash " for the Pentagon , Sen. Hatfield asserted . He also asserted that , in contrast , the White House displayed " no limitation in their lust for pushing " higher defense appropriations . Chairman Jamie Whitten ( D. , Miss. ) of the House Appropriations Committee sided with Sen. Hatfield in the debate , but ultimately gave in to the wishes of the Democratic leadership , anxious to complete the so-called continuing resolution . Congress has been forced to pass four temporary measures to finance major parts of the government since the current fiscal year began Oct. 1 , and 500 , 000 government employees were furloughed for half a day last week . The stopgap measure was needed because Congress has approved only five of 13 appropriations bills for fiscal 1985 . It includes funds for such agencies as the Agriculture , Interior , Defense , and Transportation Departments , the Postal Service and the Treasury . By far the largest part of the catchall bill goes for military spending , with a total appropriation for this fiscal year of $292. 9 billion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coup for House Democrats , funds to deploy new MX nuclear weapons couldn ' t be spent until both chambers voted affirmatively twice next spring . In addition , the bill would cut $5. 38 billion in spending authority available to the Synthetic Fuels Corp. , and cut $300 million from funds for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve . The bill also would make major changes in the criminal justice system . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
