Perhaps it began in 1948 , the first time that presidential candidates purchased television time . Perhaps it began in 1828 , when supporters of Andrew Jackson made calculated efforts to popularize the " Old Hickory " legend . Or perhaps it began with George Washington , the first true American media hero . Whatever its origins , it seems as if political advertising has always been with us . And now , as the 1984 election nears , increasing amounts of television time are being given over to political advertisements seeking to persuade voters of the virtues of President Reagan or the values of Walter Mondale . It has become so predictable , so manipulative , so very dreary : the vignettes of candidate and family , the " candid " interviews with men and women on the street , the waving flags , the purple mountain majesties . Advertising has become more than a part of the landscape of politics ; it has almost become politics itself . So " Packaging the Presidency : A History and Criticism of Presidential Advertising " ( Oxford University Press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the perspective that October ' s nightly march of political advertising so desperately lacks . Most of all , it reminds us that , as Kathleen Hall Jamieson puts it in her conclusion , " political advertising is the major means by which candidates for the presidency communicate their messages to the voters . " Ms. Jamieson , professor of communications at the University of Maryland , has , among other things , collected key examples of political huckstering from the past . Among them : the 1968 spot that consisted almost entirely of the words " Spiro Agnew for Vice President " with convulsed laughter in the background , and the 1976 effort to graft substance onto the image of a relatively unknown candidate by opening his ads with , " Jimmy Carter on the issue of . . . . " Today ' s political media wizards speak casually of two sorts of publicity : " Free media , " provided by the nation ' s traveling band of television , radio and newspaper reporters , and " paid media , " turned out by high-priced advertising firms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1952 , when the television offensive got under way in earnest , Adlai Stevenson actively tried to resist the entreaties of the image makers . The exigencies of television so depressed his opponent , Dwight D. Eisenhower , that between takes of a TV spot he sighed , " To think an old soldier should come to this . " That was 32 years ago , the last year that the amount spent on radio ads exceeded the amount spent on TV spots . The trend toward televised campaigning was even then so powerful that George Ball , then a Stevenson aide , predicted with alarm that presidential campaigns soon would have " professional actors as candidates . " Today the techniques have become more complex , the camera work more skilled , the broadcast strategies more sophisticated , but , in reality , campaign advertising hasn ' t changed very much over the years . The medium is the same and so , too , is the message . Two decades ago , for example , the Democrats sought to raise fears about Sen. Barry Goldwater ' s experience and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This particular phone only rings in a serious crisis , " the announcer said . " Keep it in the hands of a man who has proven himself responsible . " This spring , Mr. Mondale used a variation of the same theme against Gary Hart . It virtually brought an end to the Coloradan ' s campaign . The theory underlying Ms. Jamieson ' s book is that political advertising offers a prism through which to view presidential campaigns . She argues that the way candidates handle their advertising foreshadows their presidential style . " Where Nixon maintained tight control over advertising decisions in 1960 , " she writes , " Kennedy delegated all responsibility for advertising to others . " That , too , had its echoes in 1984 . In mid-March , when Mr. Hart had all but knocked Mr. Mondale out of the primaries and caucuses , his campaign stumbled in Illinois . There Mr. Hart ' s inability to remove a campaign advertisement from the air swiftly became a metaphor for what the Mondale camp described as its rival ' s lack of competence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertising so complete that it even includes ads that didn ' t run . There is , for example , Mr. Reagan ' s taped pledge in 1980 that " within the first 100 days of my administration I will go to Moscow " and " negotiate a fair arms reduction treaty . " The ad was never aired , the agreement never negotiated . Does all this distract from the sort of sober contemplation that Thomas Jefferson had in mind when he wrote of a democracy animated by the actions of an informed citizenry ? Is this any way to choose a president ? Ms. Jamieson doesn ' t really say , but the answer has to be ambivalent . Advertising gives voters a glimpse of their political leaders and even a suggestion of their visions of the future . It allows candidates to reach voters without going through the filter of professional reporters . But it also is inherently manipulative , even deceptive . After all , no matter how fine a point you put on it , it is still advertising.  --  - Mr. Shribman , a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
