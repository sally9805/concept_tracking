watching our cook , Elizabeth , lose 28 pounds while eating her usual hearty portions made a believer out of me ! We had been trying to get Elizabeth to cook high-fiber , low-fat , high-carbohydrate recipes for years . At the time I was writing the Fiber &; Bran Better Health Cookbook , she was sneaking the butter into the stew and leaving the chicken fat in the chicken soup . One is n't a prophet in one 's own home . Nathan Pritikin could do what I could n't . One visit to the Pritikin Longevity Center in California and Elizabeth was proudly displaying her weight loss while serving up Pritikin high-fiber dishes . Her jolly good nature and her obvious love of good food had won her some friends in the kitchen there . She attended their shopping tours , learning what kinds of food to buy and not to buy . In short , she came away with what she believed were the innermost secrets of the Pritikin kitchen chefs . Within a few weeks , by cooking bean soups , lentil soups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but she had n't ever stopped eating . She became a Pritikin convert . Dieting books just wo n't do the job for most people , and they never did for Elizabeth . It was the camaraderie of the Pritikin participants , thrown together for six meals a day as though they were on a cruise ship with nowhere to go , that helped her maintain the diet . Most of the participants have much in common  --  they 're middle-aged or older , have successful careers , fame and fortune  --  but a little angina . Some have the bad news from their cardiologists that the decision is theirs to make  --  to have bypass surgery to get rid of the occlusion in the vessels of their hearts , or not to bypass and run the risk of having a sudden , complete blockage of the coronary artery , with the possibility of sudden death . These people , mostly men , are highly motivated to lose weight and to lower their cholesterol levels with the well-planned diet-and-exercise program at the Pritikin Longevity Center . For this they pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days with spouse , which is still much cheaper than open-heart surgery . Obviously , with those prices , we ca n't all go to the Pritikin Longevity Center , but the food and exercise his participants get would be good for all of us . Actually , we could all save a lot of money just by exercising and eating the inexpensive starches instead of sugars and fats . The biggest savings would come from fewer trips to the hospital for medical attention . If you ca n't attend the Pritikin Longevity Center in California , or one of the other fine programs like it that have been set up in order to motivate people to take the low-fat , high-carbohydrate , high-fiber diet seriously while exercising and monitoring the blood fat levels , then read about it . You can turn your own home into a diet-andexercise experiment . FICA is the acronym almost everyone recognizes as the Social Security program , which takes 13.4 percent of all wages , 6.7 paid by the employee and 6.7 paid by the employer . The letters stand for Federal Insurance Contributions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet as the abbreviation for high FIber/CArbohydrate diet . When you see it in our books and articles , it will always mean high complex carbohydrates and low simple carbohydrates such as sugars . It will also automatically mean low fat , since fats are replaced with carbohydrates . Exercise and the FICA diet could be more important to you than the rewards you hope to receive for your FICA payroll contributions . Figures indicate that more than 100 million Americans are overweight . How do we get fat while some societies have no obesity problem whatsoever ? Extensive studies made of tribes that live in the rural areas of Africa reveal that men and women living in a rather primitive state do not suffer from obesity . Who ever saw a photo or film of a continued on following page fat Pygmy ? Consider the eating habits of the rural Zulus , in Natal , Africa . Ninety percent of their diet is carbohydrates , mostly corn and beans . Working in sugar-cane fields , they also eat unlimited amounts of raw sugar cane . But how does a high-carbohydrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The answer came from members of the Zulu tribe living in urbanized southern Africa . They too became obese ! The diet of these city Zulus consists mainly of the refined and packaged foods that we Americans consume . ( The royalty in Africa are acknowledged as authentic only if they are obese . And that is made possible because they have the wealth to obtain Westernized food . ) They eat 85 pounds of refined sugar a year , for example , compared to 6 pounds per person in the rural population . ( The average American consumes more than 100 pounds a year . ) The rest of the city man 's carbohydrates come mainly from grains  --  but they are in the form of refined white bread . His rural cousin , as we have seen , gets his carbohydrates from corn and beans . This presents a situation in which those who eat fewer carbohydrates suffer a high incidence of obesity , while those who eat more carbohydrates have almost no obesity . The difference , of course , is that unrefined carbohydrates , with their high-fiber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man 's well-being . If the fat problem were merely one of unattractive appearance , we could live with it . Unfortunately , it is a health problem , and we , too often , ca n't live with it . City-dwelling Zulus were found to have disease rates similar to the other urban people with whom they lived , but the rural Zulus were much healthier . Americans themselves were not always the " fat cats " that waddle our streets and clutter our hospitals today . The founders of our once lean and healthy nation maintained their lean physiques . Two people who are not " fat cats " are Rich and Helen DeVos . After spending two weeks at the Pritikin Longevity Center in Santa Monica , they have what my husband terms " flat turns . " When they came to Indianapolis with their son Doug , we had only two hours between their downtown appointments to enjoy dinner with them . It did n't seem fair to transport them to our home in the suburbs , so we cooked our high-fiber , high-carbohydrate food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club in the city , the Skyline Club . Luck was running our way , because the chef , it turned out , had been an Amway distributor in his spare time for four years and was excited about having Rich DeVos , Amway 's president , in his establishment for dinner . At 3:00 p.m. we brought our soybean and vegetable food for a session with the chef and all of his men , explaining in a crash course the benefits of losing weight  --  of keeping your vessels from filling in with cholesterol , of keeping your blood sugar levels just right and all the other good things that this high-fiber , high-carbohydrate , low-fat diet does for all of us . When you are proselytizing the best French gourmet chef in town you have to step lightly , but Joe O'Donnell was receptive about this dinner party . When we left our brown-looking creations on the platter in Joe 's hands , I must say I had trepidations about the outcome . But I bad nothing to fear . After a few phone calls and some last-minute shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dinner was in place . " Would we want to cleanse the palate with sorbet between the soup course and the entree ? " he wanted to know . Well , now , that 's a decision . Colorful sorbet , of course , may cleanse the palate , but it also has too many calories in it . We had n't prepared the sorbet , not being in the habit of cleansing the palate between courses . " It would help keep the cadence of the service , " Joe told us . " The waiters are accustomed to serving it . " It was included . When dinner for eight was served , the soup arrived with just the right amount of hoop cheese over the top . The entree , the piece de resist-ante , arrived steaming hot under glass , and le Baby Pheasant des Gourmets could n't have looked more enticing . There was a festive moment when the eight waiters lifted the glass from the " muchado-about-beans " main course . It takes a lot of nerve to serve a beansand-no-meat dinner party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pritikin I would never have had the courage . It was their son Doug I worried about . He plays football for Purdue University . Do Purdue athletes " carb up , " or are they still having steak at the training table , I wondered . I almost weakened to allow the club 's menu for the young people . Our daughter Joan pretends to be irreverent but basically has been converted to putting high-fiber foods back into her diet . She would reinforce her end of the table . So we made the command decision not to let anyone even glimpse the club 's posh gourmet menu . We explained to Doug later that he was included for the health menu since even 20-year-olds can start coating their arteries . In Vietnam 20-year-old American soldiers who were killed in battle were shown at autopsy to be developing cholesterol plaques in their aortas . Filling in of the blood vessels begins early on the fiber-depleted , Westernized , high-fat , refined-carbohydrate diet that most Americans were enjoying during the period between World War I and the Vietnam War . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foods . Since 1970 a large number of enlightened Americans have switched to adding fiber back to their diets . Another guest , Jim Janz , head of a large Canadian Amway empire , who had lost about 35 pounds after attending the Pritikin Longevity Center , was with us all the way . His enthusiasm for the food made a most profound impression on the young people . The salad was served after the en-tree , on the theory that we wanted the guests to be as hungry as possible during the main course . The party was acclaimed a great success , so we left our recipes with the chef , and now , hopefully , we 'll be able to order these high-fiber dishes from his menu on a regular basis : of water to make paste . Add to mushroom mixture . Blend on low burner . Gradually add water , stirring constantly . Bring to boil . Cook 5 minutes . To serve : Arrange riceand-bulgur-wheat mixture on serving platter . Place croquettes on top , Pour sauce over croquettes . Platter can be decorated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be prepared in advance and frozen for future use . This allows croquettes to be prepared for the oven in minutes . Remember to always soak the soybeans overnight to soften them before cooking . A high point in the crusade to get our readers and " LifeCare Digest " viewers to eat high-fiber diets came last week when we were visited by Dr. James Anderson , an eminent diabetologist and professor on the staff of the University of Kentucky at Lexington . He is " Mr. Oat Bran , " having persuaded the Quaker Oats Company to manufacture his oat bran when it became apparent to him that oats  --  even more than wheat bran  --  help to lower LDL ( low-density lipoproteins ) , the cholesterol that all of us should try to keep low . Dr. Anderson is now working on a new cookbook on hypoglycemia and the high-fiber diet . " I think there are new avenues in the treatment of hypoglycemia with high-fiber diets , " he said . " Fiber tends to smooth out the blood sugar . You do n't see nearly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not only will this diet help keep you stay thin , but it will help regulate the blood sugar for the diabetic and the hypoglycemic . Dr. Anderson and I are interested in a new product that was developed in West Germany . It is made from a very efficient fiber food , guar . In the past the problem has been that guar is very bad tasting and is not considered practical for including in the diet , even though it has been shown in animal experiments to be effective for lowering cholesterol and correcting high or low blood sugar levels . The new product , which has been used in Germany since May of this year , is small guar pellets that are coated with citrus flavoring . The continued on following page purpose of guar is to coat the stomach , making unnecessary the sudden flush of insulin followed by a precipitous drop in blood sugar levels occurring after a meal . For diabetics and hypoglycemics , this is particularly important . Glucotard ? has been approved for testing in this country , and it hopefully will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1984 . We visited Bio-Dynamics Inc. , which will market the product ; then we invited Dr. Anderson to stay for a dinner of Chicken Breasts Parmigiana , Stuffed Tomato-Avocado Salad , both with oat bran , and Lima Bean Soup . Recently we interviewed Richard Hammer , one of Dr. Anderson 's maturity-onset diabetics , on our " LifeCare Digest " series on the " 700 Club . " In the process of the interview , he ate breakfast in our home and requested All-Bran ? with some unprocessed bran poured over it , to which he added skim milk and strawberries . He has lost 70 pounds on Dr. Anderson 's regimen and eats a lot of potatoes , beans , rice , lentils and oatmeal . For him , an even more exciting result was September ' 83 that he could discontinue injecting insulin , which he had been doing for more than five years . An extra bonus was that his wife lost weight too while eating the food she prepared for him . . . and so it goes . Dr. Denis Burkitt is certainly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while having dinner with him and Mrs. Burkitt at Peter Island in the Caribbean last spring , there came a moment of truth . No whole-wheat bread was available ; the waitress served us white bread . I waited to see if he or Mrs. Burkitt would eat it . They both did . Dr. Burkitt explained that whenever he ca n't get whole-grain breads , he eats white because he believes it is so important to get the wheat in one 's diet . He accepts the white with reluctance . Because Dr. Burkitt works for the glory of God and not himself , many times he gives much credit to others for the work he did in telling the world about his early predictions of the tremendous effect we could make on the health of many civilized countries simply by adding back the fiber that has been removed from our flour . No article or book on the subject of obesity should end without urging everyone to read his works . In his book , Eat Right to Stay Healthy and Enjoy Life More , Dr. Burkitt says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet that contains no energy ( calories ) . If a high-fiber diet decreases energy absorbed from 1 to 12 percent , it seems reasonable to assume that fiber-rich food helps to keep a person slim . " Starting on a high-fiber , weight-loss diet could be as simple as changing from white to whole-meal bread . Studies have shown that such a minor switch makes a considerable difference in the bulk of food present in the digestive system  --  even when comparable amounts are ingested . The amount of fiber in the whole-meal bread ( four times more than white bread ) , as well as increased saliva , are the reasons . Other important additions to the high-fiber slimming plan include bran breakfast cereals , brown rice , fruits , corn , broccoli , carrots , potatoes ( especially with their skins ) , yams , raspberries and strawberries . And yes , contrary to popular belief , potatoes are not fattening  --  as long as they are n't prepared with butter or other fats . Rich in bulky fiber , they have slightly more calories than apples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Duke University disclosed the benefits of a rice diet for the cardiovascular system , we have tried to eat rice in as many ways as possible .
