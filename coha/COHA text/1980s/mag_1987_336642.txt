O.K. , so Michael Becker 's woes wo n't bring tears to your eyes , but there 's no need to snicker . Becker , 29 and single , works as a broker for Kidder Peabody on Wall Street . He earns a six-figure salary , likes his restaurants expensive and vacations in Africa , French Polynesia , Australia and London . This week he was scheduled to close on a loft apartment , but last week found him on the phone , pleading with his lawyer to extricate him from the contract . " I even told the shoeshine boy , ' I ca n't afford a shine today , ' " he laments . <P> In the giddy rise of the stock market , no figures have been so celebrated  --  and so scorned  --  as the precocious young brokers and investment bankers reveling in million-dollar co-ops , BMWs and American Express Gold Cards . These are the yuppies , the generation of boastful baby boomers who had never before known a bear market . But last week 's wild market gyrations , coming on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathless . " All of a sudden , people in my age group have come of age , " says Ian Wiener , 26 , a portfolio manager for Clemente Capital , a Manhattan money-management firm . <P> Gloating was inevitable , from the bad jokes making the rounds in San Francisco 's financial district ( What do you call a 28-year-old trader in suspenders ? Hey , waiter ! ) to the hand-lettered sign in the window of Cafe Chameleon , a Manhattan nightclub : SO YOUR BROKER 'S A LITTLE BROKER ? Says Edward Singer , 62 , a Portland , Ore. , broker : " These younger money managers had become godlike in giving advice . " <P> But at University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton School , no one was smiling . Students clustered around a computer in a lobby to check their investments . More than 150 showed up for an impromptu forum last Tuesday to discuss the effect of the market 's uncertainty on careers . " Let 's put it this way : I was a future investment banker , " says Harry Friedberg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year to pay his tuition and room and board . But now , he says , " I 'll look harder at marketing . " For Neil Donnenfeld , 25 , the panic only confirmed a decision last year to aim for a corporate career . Before he entered Wharton , he had been a broker at Evans &; Co. , making $75,000 a year . " I found the life-style absolutely unrealistic , " he says . " I mean , how much champagne can you buy ? " <P> Visions of Champale haunted young financial types as they mentally prepared themselves for a world with less Taittinger . " I used to shop at Chanel , " says M.J. Caldwell , a Wall Street broker in her mid-20s . " Now I 'll be doing my shopping at Labels for Less . " Caldwell , who majored in art history at Barnard , earns a salary in the low six figures and she spends accordingly . " I have every credit card known to man , but this morning I cut some up , " she admits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , but forget about those $100 dinners for two . " I 'll be staying home more to cook the two things I know , an omelet and Lean Cuisine . " <P> For brokers and traders threatened with layoffs , future employment may be limited . " When the highflyers making $500,000 or $1 million look for a job , it will be difficult , " said Len Clark of Boyden International , a recruiting firm in Manhattan . " There are n't many chief executives who make as much money as some of these Wall Streeters. "
