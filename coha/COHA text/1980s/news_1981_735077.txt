txt REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS have come a long way since the ** when many of them got clobbered by a rental-property glut and burdensome loan portfolios . Prudential Insurance Co. ' s $340 million acquisition this summer of Connecticut General Mortgage &; Realty Investments has called attention to the healthier outlook for the trusts , pushing up some stock prices . " Every time there 's a takeover like this , the list has a sympathetic mount up , " says Kenneth D. Campbell , president of Audit Investments Inc. , New York . Besides generating some excitement , Mr. Campbell says , the Connecticut General takeover may have helped reduce the stigma still attached to REITs . " Inflation has made a lot of very bad equity properties into good properties , " says Richard M. Lilly , senior vice president and research director at Raymond , James &; Associates Inc. , St. Petersburg , Fla . Market prices of existing properties have risen , Mr. Lilly explains , while high interest rates have discouraged new construction . Meanwhile . REITs themselves have undergone significant changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trusts has become more sophisticated than in the go-go era , when the emphasis often was on producing deals rather than solid results . In addition . REITs are adopting increasingly specialized strategies . Some are concentrating on hotel properties . or shopping centers ; others stick to certain geographic areas . THE TRUSTS ARE PUBLICLY HELD companies that are required to have more than 75% of their assets in real estate or related investments and to derive more than 75% of their income from those investments . As long as REITs pay out 95% of profits as dividends to shareholders , they are n't subject to most corporate income taxes . The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts says 25 public offerings and private placements in 1980 raised about $350 million in new capital for the industry . In the past two years , 11 REITs have been formed , the association says . Audit Investments ' Mr. Campbell , who monitors activities of 65 REITs , says a significant number of them have acquired major outside shareholders in the past two or three years . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether they like a REIT or not , " says David Leibowitz , a vice president of American Securities Corp. , New York . Mr. Leibowitz sees most investor interest concentrated on well-managed trusts and likely takeover targets . The targets , he says , include REITs with large tax-loss carryforwards that a profitable company could use to reduce its own taxes and REITs trading below book value that could be turned around by better management . " The run-of-the-mill , medium-quality stuff is doing nothing . " HIGH INTEREST RATES could compel weaker trusts to sell or otherwise liquidate some of their holdings , Mr. Leibowitz says , and stronger REITs with extra capital could " scoop up some bargains . " Big pension funds and insurance companies wo n't be bidders for such properties , he reasons , because the smallest properties these funds and companies prefer to buy are " larger than most of these REITs can afford . " Others are skeptical about such theories . " Real estate has been in a boom market now for an awfully long time , " says Leland Speed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company with investments in several REITs . " There are people who sold who now know they should have kept it . Most of the real estate I see is pretty fully priced . I 'm not seeing any distress merchandise on the market . " But if a bargain does turn up , New Plan Realty Trust intends to be prepared to buy it . New Plan , which has specialized successfully in investing in shopping centers in the Northeast , recently won authorization from shareholders to issue up to one million preferred shares . William Newman , the trust 's president and chairman , says the shares could be issued directly for property or for cash to buy property . The authorization gives management " a flexibility we did n't . have before and did n't need before , " says Mr. Newman . His operating motto for REITs : " Do n't ever get into the hands of the banks . " ITH THE SHAKEOUT of the past several years , managements of surviving REITs have become increasingly sophisticated . Says Mr. Speed : " Amateur night is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more sophisticated approach is Property Capital Trust , which paid $1.1 million in the early 1970s for the land under some garden apartments in La Jolla , Calif . The trust leased back the land to the building owner at a fixed rent of $115,500 a year plus 15% of any future rent increases charged to tenants . By the time Property Capital sold the garden apartments in July 1980 for $9 million , the income from the lease had risen to $190,000 a year . Property Capital used the net proceeds of $8.4 million in a tax-free exchange to acquire the land under a shopping center in Florida for $4.8 million and the land under a Chicago-area hotel for $3.6 million . Total fixed rent return from the two leases : $996.000 a year . Additional rental income from the two properties is expected within 18 months . But real-estate professionals caution that each REIT must be evaluated individually . " A lot of REITs still have n't devised a game plan , " says Mr. Speed . The winnowing process , he predicts , is likely to continue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
