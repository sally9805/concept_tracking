 | Like many women of her generation , Anne Fowler went through her 20s believing it was more blessed to live than to conceive . A dedicated , and upwardly mobile , teacher at Granada High School in Livermore , Calif. , she always wanted a family , but she could never figure out how to have babies without hurting her career . Last year , at the age of 31 , she stopped trying . Giving up the race for promotions ? at least temporarily ? Fowler and her husband decided to have their first child . " My mother told me that if people thought everything through , nobody would ever have children , " she laughs . " After I had my daughter , I found I wanted to stay home more . I said , wow , what happened to the career woman ? " They have traveled and worked late and dressed to succeed , and now they are seeking " something more . " Increasingly , women over 30 are becoming mothers for the first time ? whether they 're married or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days among women who have put off having children , " says psychiatrist Donald A. Bloch of New York 's Ackerman Institute for Family Therapy . That delayed action , added to a resurgence of childbearing among younger women , has boosted sales of everything from infant formula to maternity smocks , and has put pediatricians on overtime . " I 've practically got dishpan hands from all the baptisms I 'm doing , " beams the Rev. Bill Nebo , minister of the Livermore Presbyterian Church . " Our cradle roll has just exploded . " More than 3.6 million babies were born in the United States last year , . the highest number since 1970 . For the most part , this baby boomlet reflects the fact that , with the post-World War II baggy-boom generation reaching adulthood , there are simply more potential mothers than ever before . In the last seven years the number of women of childbearing age has swelled by 6.7 million to 51.9 million . And though the overall U.S. birthrate has not risen , the rate among women in their early 30s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first births among women of that age has jumped by 37 per cent in recent years . The trend is sharpest among urban professional women , and has caused startling changes in some middle-class enclaves ; the mean age of new mothers at Chicago 's Northwestern Memorial Hospital , for example , is now 33 , and demand has forced New York 's Maternity Center to raise the maximum age for non-hospital deliveries from 34 to 39 for first-time mothers . What made so many women postpone having children until now was a complex of social and economic factors . The feminist movement illuminated alternate paths women could take besides marriage and motherhood , and better methods of birth control provided the freedom of choice to pursue them . Changing sexual mores also played a part , while inflation and recession made it difficult for couples to feel secure enough financially to start a family . Women put off pregnancy while they advanced in their careers , saved for a house , earned a doctorate ? or reveled in the narcissism of the Me Decade . " The thing about babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life neatly , " says New York publicist Eileen Guiliani , 34 , who tried for years to have a child and ultimately chose not to . Back to the Family : Throughout it all , however , counterpressures were pushing women toward motherhood . Medical breakthroughs like amniocentesis ? a test for age-linked genetic defects in a fetus that permits time for abortion if problems are found ? may have made later pregancies safer and less stressful . But there was still no way of getting around the ultimate deadline of menopause . " These women do n't suddenly discover God , motherhood and apple pie , " says sociologist Norma Wikler , coauthor of a study of older mothers called " Up Against the Clock . " " They have deferred and deferred and now see that deadline approaching . " Other experts see traces of renewed traditionalism at work , along with peer pressure and a bit of back-tothe-family faddishness . " I think it 's sort of a contagion that 's going on , " says New York psychologist Iris Fodor . " My patients see their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In some cases , the need to nurture waxes strong enough to inspire deliberate unwed motherhood . Some women stop practicing birth control without telling their lovers ; others turn to artificial insemination . A few even advertise for prospective fathers in newspapers . " I was really getting desperate , " says one unmarried woman , a 40-year-old Federal bureaucrat in Washington @# @#  | who called up an old beau at one point to propose procreation . " I started to get weepy when I watched certain movies or saw young mothers and their children strolling down the street . " Finally , she became pregnant by a man she knew in another city . Her family and friends , she says , have generally been supportive . " Most of them think I 'm pretty gutsy , " she says . But she admits they are dubious about her decision not to tell the father that the child is his ? a plan that seems bound to produce problems in the future . " At some point , the child will want to know about its father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him . " Rite of Passage : Even when it 's by choice , single motherhood is difficult . Myra Shapiro , a 37-year-old San Francisco museum staffer , convinced her longtime boyfriend to father her child last year ? and now finds him unwilling to share the daily responsibilities of parenthood . " He 's supporting us , " she says , " but that 's almost the extent of it . He looks at me and says , I ca n't help you , I do n't know how ' . " To ease the burdens of single parenthood , some older unwed mothers share custody with married or divorced friends ? and a surprising number say their offspring are worth the effort . " It has n't been as easy as I thought it would be , and I 've been forced to take a raw look at myself , " says unmarried Atlanta model Jacqui Gordon , who became a mother last year at 32 . " But I 'm very happy about my decision . " Under any circumstances , the decision to start a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mothers alike . " When the family used to kid us , Hey , when are you Ong to start a family , ' we used to shrug It off and say , Some day in the future ' , " recalls Gary Stern , 30 , of Nashua , N. H. , whose 30-year-old wife El- len is five months pregnant . " One day , we woke up and realized the future is now . " For older couples , the process can be especially traumatic . Infertility may plague them , along with doubts about what a small , squalling outsider might do to their sex or social lives , budget or freedom . When the infant arrives , adjusting to new realities is rarely easy . Career women turned mothers can find themselves torn by guilt when they head back to work ; fathers may resent the intruder . " The new baby almost wrecked my marriage , " says one older father , a New York pension consultant . " We 're much more set in our ways and had a much harder time adjusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , most older first-time mothers insist that the advantages of age outweigh the problems . " I 'm so ready and so anxious to have this child , " says 37-year-old Natalie Jacobson , who co-anchors the local news on a Boston TV station with her husband , Chet Curtis . " I already have an identity outside the home . I do n't feel a child will cheat me out of anything ; I am established and I 'm not frightened that I 'll lose my job . " Such madonnalike serenity is rare among new mothers ? but it may well sweep the nursery as more old hands at ruling the working world start rocking cradles as well .
