THE TALK OF THE TOWN N otesand Comment AFRIEND of ours who , by dint of hard work , acumen , and aptitude , managed to rise to the rank of corporal during his two years in the Korea-era Army , dropped by recently to show off a letter he had received in early December from Geraldine Ferraro . The text was unremarkable . " On behalf of myself and the entire Democratic Party , I want to thank you for your generous contribution , " it began , and it went on , " You and I can be proud of our participation in the 1984 elections . We worked hard and we did our very best . " It was even possible  --  we could n't tell for sure  --  that Ms. Ferraro herself had not actually physically signed the letter . But the salutation ! The salutation more than made up for all that . " Dear Lt. Cdr. , " it read . Lieutenant commander  --  a promotion by four ranks without any duty , active or reserve . Not only that , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( The Army has no lieutenant commanders ; it 's the naval equivalent of a major . ) For doing nothing more than tell stories over the years about the life of an MP and the time spent at Fort Ord , in California , where the staple of the base diet was the artichoke . This was like one of those bachelors ' degrees from Oxford that automatically mature into masters ' degrees with the passage of four years and the payment of five pounds ; this was like finding that the bottle of Welch 's grape juice in the back of the refrigerator had turned into a magnum of Most &; Chandon . For several days , our friend straightened his shoulders , enjoyed the imaginary salutes of passersby , and ordered small children to paint all the stones in the neighborhood white . His ascension , he suspected , was too good to he true  --  but it was awfully nice of the Democrats . Then , several days later , a second letter arrived , this one on the letterhead of Democratic National Committee Chairman Charles T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on to beg our friend 's pardon for the Ferraro missive : " Unfortunately , due to a clerical error , many of the letters contained erroneous titles or salutations . If you received one of these incorrect letters , I want to apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused you . " A spokesman for the Democrats , Neel Lattimore , told us , when we called to ask , that some five thousand addressees had been mistakenly saluted by the National Committee computer . " Whoever was doing the inputting was neglecting to hit the mister ' code , " he said . " There were lots of titles  --  judge , colonel , general . We sent out the second letter because it was our mistake and we wanted to apologize to people . " Ever since the November election , people have been turning to each other at cocktail gatherings and asking , " What 's the matter with the Democrats ? Was it simply a case of an unappealing candidate , or are there structural problems that may require a rethinking of the Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even found its way onto the Op-Ed pages of America 's leading newspapers . It seems to us that the letter incident reveals a key shortcoming  --  shows the Democrats to be the kind of guys who if you 've blown a nice big bubble will come up and pop it and then stand there watching you . Sure , reality is a fine thing , and it 's great to go around with a long face about the deficit and the capital-gains tax , and whatnot . But you do n't need to be throwing cold water on people just when they 're enjoying their lieutenant commandership . Pretty soon , the Democrats will be mailing people advance information on the outcomes of the season 's " Dallas " episodes , so we 'll all be able to spend more time , in the words of the Ferraro letter , " reflecting , thinking , and planning . " That may be what America needs . Still , there are Democrats who might give thought to some words of Huey Long , a proved vote-getter : " Every man a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small reddish-gray lump that sits at the base of the brain between the cerebral hemispheres . It gets its name from the Latin word for " pinecone , " though it resembles a pinecone only vaguely . Descartes thought it was the seat of the soul . He was wrong , but , as it turns out , he was n't entirely off base . In some reptiles and birds , the pineal is close enough to the top of the skull to be directly affected by sunlight , and in these creatures it seems to act as a kind of third eye , helping them adjust their behavior to changes in the day-night cycle as the seasons change . The fact that the human pineal is buried deep within the brain is one that Descartes found most suggestive , but it led later investigators to conclude that evolution had bypassed the gland , effectively blinding the third eye . As recently as ten years ago , medical textbooks described the pineal gland in mammals as a " vestigial " structure  --  a functionless evolutionary leftover , like the appendix . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago when we attended a scientific conference on " The Medical and Biological Effects of Light . " The driving force behind the conference was Dr. Richard J. Wurtman , of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Dr. Wurtman , who is forty-eight years old but looks ten years younger , directs M.I.T. 's Laboratory of Neuroendocrine Regulation . He was introduced to the mysteries of the pineal gland while he was a student at Harvard Medical School , in 1957 . Some Harvard researchers had just discovered that after the pineal glands of immature female rats were removed the rats ' ovaries increased in size . Wurtman spent one summer shining bright lights on immature female rats and got the same result  --  enlarged ovaries  --  without removing their pineals . To the small band of investigators who explored the implications of this work , it was clear by the mid-sixties that there was nothing vestigialabout the mammalian pineal gland . Researchers demonstrated that the growth of the reproductive organs of many animals ( from the albino laboratory rat to the Djungarian hamster ) is regulated by a hormone manufactured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this hormone named mela-tonin  --  is controlled by special nerve pathways , which bring information about light from the eyes to the pineal . But judgments enshrined in medical textbooks take time to change . As one of the pioneers in this field , Dr. Virginia M. Fiske , of Wellesley College , recalled at the conference , " it is not an exaggeration to say that , on occasion , work on the pineal was ridiculed . " Ridicule was clearly not a concern of the scientists who took part in the conference , which was held under the auspices of the New York Academy of Sciences . Of particular interest to us were their discussions of the effects of light ( many of which are mediated by the pineal gland ) on human beings . In separate papers , Dr. Alfred J. Lewy , of Oregon Health Sciences University , and Dr. Norman E. Rosenthal , of the National Institute of Mental Health , told of having encouraging successes in treating carefully selected groups of depressed patients with bright lights . And Dr. Lewy and Dr. Rutger A. Weyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , talked about how exposure to bright light at the right time of day might help air THE NEW YORKER. these people would snap out of depression if they were exposed to an artificial spring , Dr. Rosenthal and his colleagues had them sit in front of a bank of unusually bright lights for five or six hours each day . Their depression lifted within two to four days ; when treatment with the bright lights was withheld , their symptoms reappeared in about the same length of time . Dr. Lewy has had similar success with his group of winter-depressive patients , but he believes that there may be more to the therapeutic effect than simply extending a patient 's day to mimic spring or summer . He speculates that there may be people whose internal body rhythms , such as the daily rise and fall in melatonin production , become desynchronized from their own sleeping-waking cycle . Treating such patients with exposure to bright light at specific times of the day may make it possible to shift the internal clock to an earlier or later time with some precision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer agreement with the patient 's subjective day and night . On the basis of his understanding of the body 's cyclic activities , Dr. Lewy ventured some recommendations for air passengers ' self-treatment of jet lag . People flying from the East Coast to the West Coast should be able to speed up their adjustment to the new time zone by spending a few hours outside in the late afternoon for a couple of days . Travellers from the West Coast to the East Coast should follow the same procedure , but in the morning . Exposure to ordinary artificial light seems to have no effect on our internal clocks . The reason , apparently , is that the incandescent and fluorescent fixtures we are accustomed to are simply not bright enough . Dr. Lewy has shown that light must be at least four times as bright as ordinary room lighting to have an effect on melatonin production . And even on an overcast winter day in the middle of a big city sunlight on the street will be from twenty to two hundred times as bright as the artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments reported at the conference in which artificial light was used to mimic the sun , banks of fluorescent fixtures were used to attain the requisite brightness , and in most cases the fixtures were supplied by the Duro-Test Corporation , a New Jersey company that manufactures a patented fluorescent lamp , sold under the name Vita-Lite , that simulates the fulI beneficial spectrum of sunlight all ex-cept the harmful ultraviolet part , that is . Luke Thorington , the vice-president of engineering of Duro-Test and the inventor of Vita-Lite , was one of the participants in the conference , which received major funding from Duro-Test . Mr. Thorington was in- traduced to us as " the man who holds the patent on sunlight . " He is an engineer who speaks like a mystic when he gets on the subject of natural ( or simulated ) sunlight versus the " impoverished spectrum " of indoor lighting that most of us spend most of our waking hours under . There is an extensive literature documenting the effects of replacing ordinary fluorescent lamps with Vita-Lites of the same wattage in the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher productivity , but these findings have been challenged by other researchers , and by representatives of other lighting manufacturers , who can not produce a fluorescent lamp that simulates the full beneficial spectrum of sunlight without infringing Duro-Test 's patent . We sought out Dr. Wurtman to ask him what he thought about Vita-Lite . After cautioning us that the simulated-sunlight lamp has been listed as a medical device by the Food and Drug Administration . In fact , he said , there is more and more reason to think of light as a kind of drug , which , depending on the situation and the individual , can have good or bad effects . Dr. Wurtman went on to say , " In the world of nutrition , if you make a synthetic product , such as artificial orange juice , that leaves out an important ingredient of the natural product , such as Vitamin C , it is your obligation to add that missing ingredient to the product before it goes to market . We are getting to the stage where we may have to ask similar questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back the missing ingredients  --  those parts of the spectrum of natural sunlight that ordinary light bulbs leave out ? " Centennial RUTH DRAPER is usually described as a monologuist , though the term sounds too pompous for her flights of comedy . She was really a stand-up comic , though that term sounds too hip and aggressive . What Ruth Draper did through the first half of this century was to go out on a stage , with very few props , and become various characters  --  a Maine fisherman 's wife , an English tourist in Italy , a Scottish immigrant at Ellis Island ? and just carry on , usually to hilarious effect . This unadorned performance was immensely popular ; she held Broadway houses enthralled , and toured the country and the world . When she died , in 1956 ? at seventy-two , in her sleep , after her evening 's performance  --  her renown faded , but a quiet influence endured . For example , when Lily Tomlin was doing impressions in a coffeehouse in Detroit an incidental comment by a stranger directed her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own words , " totally inspired " by the possibilities of the monologue and was from that day committed to the form ; and a Ruth Draper cult has lately sprung up among young actors . This information recently emerged at a celebration of her hundredth birthday which was held in the theatre underneath St. Peter 's Lutheran Church , at Citicorp . The event was part profes sional reminiscence , part performance , and part family affair  --  a rather strange melange , but one that was not inappropriate for this unusual person  --  and in the end the disparate flashes that emerged from it composed themselves into a remarkably rounded picture . An odd thing about Ruth Draper , accentuated at her centennial by a strong family presence , was that she was a " lady , " born in New York in 1884 ? not the sort of background that encouraged women to become professional people , much less to go on the stage . But she did it , apparently without upsetting herself or anyone else . She started out casually entertaining people at social occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private occasions in both New York and London . ( This in itself seems peculiar . For example , she performed for the Queen and was later presented to the Queen as a member of society . ) Eventually , Henry James , who in 1913 had called her " the little genius , " redeemed himself for this remark by encouraging her to go public . " You have woven yourself a magic carpet . Stand on it , " he said . She seems to have been carried along by an almost childlike confidence . When she was invited to perform in hotels across the country , she handled her own bookings . She performed for the troops . Then she went on to bigger things . She got on her magic carpet , and it flew . The innocent-confident side of Ruth Draper came through in a lively de-scription of her by Charles Bowden , who was her co-producer ( with Rich-ard Barr ) and director in the later years ( " If anyone can be said to have directed Ruth , " he remarked ) . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became ill in the middle of the run of a show that Bowden was managing , and Ruth Draper was booked in on very short notice . They met at four o'clock on the opening date , and she said , " It 's only four o'clock . I do n't go on till eight-thirty . Why do you want me here so soon ? " Bowden replied that he thought they ought to look over the script , and she said , " What script ? " He said they had to discuss lighting cues and other tech-nicalities . She replied , " You ring up the curtain , I go on . And when I 'm finished I come off and you ring down the curtain . " He said they should dis-cuss time . " What about time ? " she asked . " Well , it would he overtime for JANUARY 14 , 1985 the union members and be quite expensive if we run beyond eleven-thirty , " he said . She replied , " Oh , the unions have always been very kind to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mattered , since people get tired of even the best performance after a while . " Oh , I always feel that before they do , " Ruth Draper said , " and then I stop . " The other side of this blithe attitude was that she could perform only under conditions of unadulterated spontaneity . She could not write her material down without spoiling it , and if she knew that a recording machine was on , or even that a person was taking dictation , she froze . Toward the end of her life , Bowden realized that her work was simply going to evaporate when she died . Through the intervention of Toscanini , a recording session was arranged at RCA . But , try as she might , as soon as the machines were on she became wooden . They tried to solve this by recording at eight-thirty  --  theatre time ? and by gathering a little audience in the control room , and so forth , but she could not overcome her self-consciousness . Then a technician suggested that she come at seven-thirty and warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , and was  --  for the warmup  --  in top form . Surreptitiously , the switches on the recording machines were turned on . The next day , the same procedure was followed , and the next  --  and , always , at eight-thirty , when Ruth Draper thought the recording began , her performance curdled , The recordings that Lily Tomlin found in the Detroit Public Library had all been made in warmup time . Bowden said he had difficulty explaining to Ruth Draper the presence of certain pieces on the records . " Did 1 do that for the recording ? " she would ask . " Well , it 's there , so I must have . " There may have been something of willed innocence in that ; Bowden said he never knew if she knew . In 1953 , when Bowden , again in association with Barr , produced a one-woman show with Ethel Waters , Ruth Draper called him and asked , " Why- is n't it me ? " ( The tone in which he quoted her was genuinely puzzled . ) The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the next clay and said , " All right , now we can get on with my show . " Bowden explained that he could n't go to his investors for a one-woman show right on top of one that had failed . " Why do you have to go to your investors ? " she asked . He explained what it THE NEW YORKER would cost to mount a show . " I know that , " she said . " I give you a check for the amount , and two weeks into the run you pay me back . After that , we divide the profits equitably . So why do we need investors ? I do n't want anyone to gamble on me . " " Ruth , I ca n't guarantee that I 'll be able to return your money , " he said . She said , " Oh , you do n't have to guarantee it . You can just give it to me . " ( This is exactly what happened with every Draper show produced by Bowden and Barr . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , as Bowden described her : " It was always the same routine . First , she would put a bit of cream on her face from a bottle of Nivea always the tiniest size , the ten-cent size . Then she 'd take the cream off with Kleenex , very slowly . Then she would begin carefully outlining her eyes with a pencil . The pencil had no point , and , while I 'm not certain , I think it was just an artist 's pencil anyway . Then she would dip her finger into a very old jar of Guerlain lip rouge and do her lips with a wide , extravagant gesture . The rouge in that jar was as hard as a golf ball . It was pitted with age . Then she 'd look up and say ' Done . ' Her Face was unchanged . " In one of the more sentimental remarks of the evening , Neilla Warren , who knew Ruth Draper and is now writing a biography of her , said she was sure that " Ruth , looking down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears " ? and added , almost as an aside , " She nearly always was . " The centerpiece of the evening was Patrizia Norcia 's performance of two Draper pieces , each containing several characters . ( Miss Norcia , an actress who has been studying Ruth Draper 's work for seven years , or ever since she first encountered it , at the Yale School of Drama , can perform six hours of Draper material . ) The characters ranged from the fiat-out silly  --  a giggly Swedish peasant girl singing a folk song ( made-up versions of foreign languages were a Draper specialty ) ? to the impossible-serious : a silent rendition of a woman in an Italian church praying before a portrait of the Madonna and having a mystical-religious experience . Miss Norcia brought off not only both of these extremes but the solid middle-ground characters as well : a Midwestern woman guiding a tour of Midwestern women through an Italian church ; a cynical beggar-woman in the church ; an Englishwoman trying to copy the famous fres ? co in the church , in competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The comedy in this material lives , and one reason may he that it always goes one step beyond caricature . It mocks , and sharply , but there is an affection for the characters , no matter how absurd , that also comes through . Lily Tomlin said to us on the phone later , " I guess it 's just the completeness . There 's such a richness of language and character and humor and humanity and , I guess , artistry . Artistry is the word . " We heard from Ruth Draper 's nephew William Carter , a former U.N . official , about " Aunt Scrub , " so named because when he and his brother , after an autumn of rugby playing , went to visit her at a house she had in England , she immediately plunged them into a bathtub . Aunt Scrub took the boys on a bicycle tour of the neighborhood , alarming natives with particularly loud and outrageous versions of her made-up foreign languages . We heard from her nephew Paul Draper , the dancer , who performed with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't " a real theatre person " ) , about Ruth Draper coping with an absolutely dead audience , and Ruth Draper meandering on as the fisherman 's wife past the moment of union overtime while the producer made violent " cut " signals in the wings . Wildly frustrated , both producer and nephew assumed that she was just being innocent . " Ruth , please do n't go on like that past eleven . Please , " the producer said when she finally came off . Ruth Draper replied , " I thought she 'd never stop talking . " Paul Draper 's daughter Pamela , herself art actress , rounded off the evening with her memory of visiting her great-aunt 's place in Maine . There were always lots of children , she said , and Ruth Draper always tucked each one in for the night . ( Ruth Draper herself never married . ) To each she would recite a poem always the same poem , which Pamela Draper said she would recite for us now . It was by Alexander Anderson , a Scotsman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line was " The bairnies cuddle doon at nicht . " It was , as we had been warned ,
