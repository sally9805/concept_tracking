After a two-year chill , the U.S. warms up to an old friend <P> Reagan gave away the store and got nothing in return , " said a White House critic of the Administration 's Middle East policies . At a State Department dinner for Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir , a few guests even joked about raising the Star of David flag over the White House to signal the " Israeli victory . " <P> The verbal barbs were aimed at a new " strategic cooperation " agreement between the U.S. and Israel worked out during a three-day visit to Washington by Shamir and his top aides . Although the details need to be ironed out in future meetings between lesser officials of both nations , the package of military aid and trade concessions places Israel back in the forefront of U.S. policy in the Middle East , at the calculated risk of upsetting the moderate Arab states . As such , it was an abrupt shift in the Administration 's Middle East policy , which had stressed U.S. efforts to play an evenhanded mediator 's role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Secretary of State George Shultz , who has felt personally betrayed by the refusal of Syrian President Hafez Assad to carry out a promise to withdraw troops from Lebanon after Israel not only agreed to do so but unilaterally and prematurely drew back to safer positions in southern Lebanon , actually against U.S. wishes . The agreement is virtually a return to former Secretary of State Alexander Haig 's " consensus of strategic concerns , " in which U.S. and Israeli military cooperation was seen as vital to discouraging Soviet intrusion into Middle East politics and , more broadly , to keep Western oil supplies flowing from the Persian Gulf . Explained one U.S. diplomat : " The U.S. can have a Middle East policy with Israel or one without Israel . For the past 15 months we 've had one without Israel . Now we 're going back to one with Israel . " <P> In a second burst of Middle East diplomacy just 22 hours later last week , President Reagan met with Lebanon 's embattled President Amin Gemayel , and heard the closer U.S.-Israel ties criticized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabia 's Ambassador to the U.S. Although mostly planned in advance , the week 's activity had an air of urgency . Repeatedly frustrated in its efforts to solve the Lebanon crisis and the Palestinian dilemma , and with U.S. Marines still exposed to terrorism , shelling and sniper fire at the Beirut airport , the Administration felt it was time to shake up the ingredients in the Middle East mix . Its thin but persistent hope was that greater tragedies could be averted and a semblance of stability restored .
