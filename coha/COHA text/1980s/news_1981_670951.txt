The cost to the region in Federal Medicaid funds , housing subsidies , development grants , welfare payments and other social programs could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars in the coming fiscal year and increasing amounts thereafter , the officials said . The Senate passed a similar bill Thursday , and the package now goes to a joint Senate-House conference for resolution of the remaining differences. // Just two weeks ago , budgetary analysts were saying that committees in the Democratically controlled House had managed to ease the likely hurt of the Reagan Administration ' s proposed cuts . Julian Spirer , New York City ' s chief lobbyist in Washington , said then that the emerging picture looked " much brighter " than it had in March. // // A ' Very Serious Setback ' // But Mr. Spirer said yesterday that the substitute bill , passed Friday by a vote of 217 to 211 , was " a very serious setback . " " It restores most of the damaging features of the Administration ' s original budget plan , " he said. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s chief lobbyist said from Washington . " But when you ' re dealing with a document you ' ve never had in your hands , " added the lobbyist , Ann Sullivan , " you ' re never going to be certain. " // Fiscal analysts for New York City and New Jersey cautioned that many aspects of the quickly drafted House bill remained unclear . And estimates of the effects of the cuts have been tinged with politics , with local officials sometimes offering what they acknowledge are " worst case " scenarios in an effort to influence the outcome of the budget process. // Mayor Koch said yesterday through a spokesman that he knew no more about the bill ' s details than did many Representatives who had voted on it . The Mayor added , " I am hoping for the best , but I ' m preparing for the worst. " // The House bill was sponsored by Representative Phil Gramm , Democrat of Texas , and Representative Delbert L. Latta , Republican of Ohio . Dozens of conservative Democrats joined the Republican minority to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New York City , said Mr. Spirer , was the bill ' s 7 1/2 percent annual cap on the growth of Federal Medicaid expenditures. // " This would translate , " he said , " into a potential $79 million loss in Federal reimbursements to the city in fiscal year 1982 , " which begins Oct. 1 . He was measuring the loss , he explained , against expected Federal aid under present formulas. <> <> $197 Million Loss Projected // The city ' s loss for fiscal 1983 could increase to $126 million , and for fiscal 1984 to $197 million . Mr. Spirer said committee versions of proposed Medicaid cuts would have meant losses to the city of only $14 million in 1982 , $10 million in 1983 , and $5 million in 1984 . But the Democratic leadership of the House had been unable to persuade enough Democrats to go along with the more moderate reductions. // Supporters of the Administration ' s economic plans have long felt that social spending programs that rise automatically with inflation endanger the very possibility of a balanced budget , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City in the Gramm-Latta bill , Mr. Spirer said , was the cutback in total allocations for the Urban Development Action Grants program and the Community Development Block Grants . He estimated that the city would lose $25 million in 1982 as a result of a cut in total funds for the newly combined programs . <> <> Day-Care Centers Affected // " In the social services area , " Mr. Spirer continued , " the Gramm-Latta substitute would mean a loss of approximate $43 million in 1982 . That translates into the probable closing of 67 day-care centers and 29 senior citizen centers. " // In Federal housing aid , Mr. Spirer said , the Gramm-Latta bill would reduce the allocation the city would have received under an earlier committee proposal by the equivalent of 1 , 500 units . " The bill also calls for the implementation of rent increases for tenants in public housing projects , " he said. // Mr. Spirer said it was not yet clear whether revisions in the rules of eligibility for food stamps would mean an immediate cut in the city ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would " obviously " mean cuts in the years beyond 1982. // Looking ahead to the Senate-House conference , Mr. Spirer pointed out several differences in the two bills that made the Senate version " preferable " from New York City ' s perspective . The Senate bill , for example , asked for a 9 percent annual cap on the growth of Medicaid , instead of 7 1/2 percent . The House bill , moreover , had requested a Federal fee on the ocean dumping of sewage sludge and harbor dredge , which could cost city businesses and taxpayers as much as $90 million a year . The Senate , he said , had imposed no such fee . <> <> ' Dismaying ' for Jersey // For New Jersey , the House bill was described by Marilyn Berry Thompson , Governor Byrne ' s chief Washington lobbyist , as comparably dismaying. // A week ago , fiscal analysts had placed the cost to New Jersey of cuts then being proposed in committee at $600 million . But a quick analyis of Friday ' s provisions suggested additional 1982 losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for child nutrition ; $300 , 000 for Rutgers University ; the equivalent of 300 housing units ; $17. 5 million in student benefits under Social Security ; and $10 million for Medicaid. // As for Connecticut , Ann Sullivan suggested from Washington that the proposed Medicaid cap would cost the state $10 million dollars next year . She added that she wished such complicated matters as redefining eligibility standards and block grants had been discussed at greater length , or at least printed , before the vote . She added , however , that at least one Republican member of the House from Connecticut had , in her words , " seen the document in advance , and he felt comfortable with it. " //
