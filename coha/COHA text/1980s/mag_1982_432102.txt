 | THE LETTERS , brownish with age , were held in large folio volumes . As I scanned the crabbed handwriting , the misspelled words , I could envision the author . He was then 26 , of just below average height , skinny , with brown hair and blue-gray eyes . A colleague joked that in the saddle he looked like a boy riding his father 's horse , but he commanded the French Army in Italy . And if those blue-gray eyes flashed as he wrote , it was not difficult to understand . He was killing men well and winning battles ; he understood now that his intellect was superior and that he might do great things in Europe ; and he was in love . " Josephine , " he wrote , " you should have left Paris on the 5th , you should have left on the 11th ; you had not left the 12th . . . My soul was open to happiness : it is full of sorrow . ... You have never loved . . . . Cruel ! . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't write me any more , and at least respect my asylum . A thousand daggers tear at my heart ; do n't push them in any more . Good-bye , my happiness , my life , everything that exists for me on earth ! " Josephine did come in time to Italy , but the letters continued . She stayed in a palace ; he was often off with the army . " Three days without your letters , " he wrote . " Today , alone with the thoughts , the work , the writing , the men and their tedious projects and cackling , I do n't even have a note from you  | that I could put on my heart . . . . Think of me , live for me. . . . adorable Josephine . One of these nights , the doors will open with a crash : like a jealous man , and there I will be in your bed . A thousand loving kisses .

For four months I would follow his footsteps , seeking to unravel the enigma of his personality , to measure the effect he had in the shaping of modern Europe and France , to see what remains of his legend . I would travel to a dozen nations , from the Soviet Union in the east to Spain in the west , and to Egypt and the tiny island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic . In time I would begin to feel his presence : When I arrived someplace , it often seemed as if he had only just departed ; the map cases , the portable field bed , the cheap snuff he favored all having been shoved hurriedly into an army wagon moments before it clattered off . And I would come to feel I knew the people who had touched his life : his large and quarrelsome family , the many lovers , the implacable enemies , and the men who served him ; above all , Josephine , who , although divorced and dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The themes of those early letters , when the world and all about him seemed young , would reappear . " She would not embrace me , " the dying emperor whispered , " she disappeared at the moment when I was about to take her in my arms .... " THE MOUNTAINS rush down to the sea around Ajaccio , Corsica . Ferryboats slip in and out of the bay , laden with sun-seeking tourists . In the old part of the city , shutters pop open with the morning sun , laundry flutters over narrow lanes , and you may chance upon a procession of sailors , bearing on their shoulders an image of their patron , imploring safety at sea . Napoleon would recognize his street , his house . He was born on the first floor August 15 , 1769 . His mother , Letizia , began labor while at Mass and rushed home ; there was  | no time to reach her quarters on the second floor . The baby was puny , but filled out after a wet nurse was hired , a sailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the father , Carlo , 23 , charming , flighty , a lawyer . They were the handsomest couple among Ajaccio 's gentry . Both came from families that had come from Italy two centuries before . They spoke Italian , bought their clothes in Italy ; Carlo held his degree from Pisa . And 152 so , although the island had recently come into French hands , the boy was christened Italian style , Napoleone Buonaparte . He developed a strong body , learned to swim , fight , climb trees . He liked especially a farm the family owned in the hills above Ajaccio . I went there with Jean Graziani , an architect helping restore the old house there . " He loved this farm , " Jean said . " He did not speak only once about it , but many times . " I could understand that affection : There was the smell of sun-warmed earth , olive trees , grape vines , the base of a great oven . I remembered one of his relatives had boasted : " The Buonapartes have never paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was in some ways a Corsican , " Jean said . " Here the family is very important , very close ; so it was with Napoleone , all his life . And he was very proud , like most Corsicans . His mother told him to always put up a good front , to have a nice parlor to receive friends , even if he had to eat only bread . " But there was one Corsican convention that the boy Napoleone would not accept . In Corsica the first son is the most important , the others less so . Napoleone , the second son , constantly harassed and competed with the first , Giuseppe ? Joseph . AT THE AGE OF NINE , Napoleone went off to France to school , along with Giuseppe . Napoleone , with a royal scholarship , attended the Royal Military School of Brienne , in Champagne . Here he spent five years , seeing his family twice . According to the testimony of classmates , he was a loner , did n't talk much , did n't play much . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It expounded the rationalist philosophy of the Cartesians ; he was taught to classify , to arrange things logically . Teaching was by memorizing , reciting . He had an extraordinary memory , filing things away in his head as if in some giant and always accessible cabinet . And the texts he memorized were those of the ancient Greeks and Romans . A young cadet might well come to admire ancient Rome and its institutions , might dream of himself becoming an Alexander , a Caesar . From Brienne , Napoleon went to the Ecole Militaire in Paris , graduating in 1785. @#  | For seven years he led the life of a lieutenant in garrison , poverty-stricken , often on leave , usually in Corsica . He skimped to buy books , read , and was influenced by the romanticism and political thought of Rousseau . He wrote himself , on politics , history , the nature of man , a dreamy romance . These were the years of the French Revolution and its turmoil . In 1789 a mob stormed the Bastille ; in ' 92 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 93 the Reign of Terror commenced , with the heads of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette dropping into the executioners ' baskets , along with the heads of thousands of others . Rival revolutionary groups competed for power . " As things are , " Napoleon wrote his brother Joseph , " I see only one thing clear ; I must keep on the right side of those who have been and can be my friends . " Those friendships , and the Bonaparte luck , paid off . He happened to be near Toulon when a revolutionary army , besieging royalist forces in that city , needed an artillery officer . Napoleon , with that " eye " French generals still marvel at , sized up the situation , positioned the guns , blasted the defenders into submission . The young captain became a brigadier . Less than two years later he commanded the guard at the Tuileries palace in Paris , where the revolutionary government met , when a mob marched on it . He remembered a similar event during the time of the king ; the soldiers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitate , but gave them " a whiff of grapeshot . " Many died , the remainder fled . That " whiff of grapeshot " made Napoleon well known in Paris , and he was invited into the salons . At one he met Josephine de Beauharnais , a beautiful Creole born in the French West Indies , the widow of a noble executed during the Terror . She was 32 , six years his senior , and had two children , Eugene , 14 , and Hortense , 12 . She was said to have had many lovers . Napoleon , the scrawny country boy from Corsica who was still embarrassed by his Italian accent , was smitten : " Madame de Beauharnais was the first woman who gave me any degree of confidence . One day when I was sitting next to her at table , she began to pay me all manner of compliments on my military qualities . Her praise intoxicated bruary 1982 Napoleon me . From that moment I confined my conversation to her and never left her side . I was passionately in love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had evoked . When he proposed marriage , she held back . Still , she was getting older , had the children to support , and he was , in his way , attractive . Two days after the marriage in March 1796 , Napoleon left for southern France and 153 command of the Armee d'Italie . He began to sign his name in the French fashion ? Bonaparte . He carried a portrait of Josephine in a locket and would take it out and kiss it from time to time . The letters began : " My only consolation is in writing to you . . . you are the confidante of all my troubles . " I drove eastward from Milan . There was morning mist , a red sun , the rich smells of corn and dairy farms . Napoleon began his campaign against the Austrians in Italy in mid-April . It was a continuation of war that @# had begun a few years earlier ? a struggle between a revolutionary France , eager to export its new ideas of government , and almost all the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Napoleon fought by new rules , marching at night , fighting in the rain and on Sundays , gambling boldly . The old generals opposing him were baffled . Victory followed victory : Lodi , Castiglione , Arcola , Rivoli , Mantua . My destination was Lodi , for something special happened to Napoleon there . It is a quiet town ; a stone bridge has replaced the wooden one of Napoleon 's time . Below it , fishermen with 20-foot poles seek the barbi and cavedani that break the surface . Napoleon reached here early in the campaign , desperate for a decisive victory . He found the Austrian rear guard across that bridge . He wanted that bridge . He rode into the center of the fighting , personally sited 24 cannon , then with a stirring speech sent a column of grenadiers charging across the bridge into the mouths of the Austrian cannon . The Austrians broke and fled . The battle established Napoleon with his troops : They dubbed him " le petit caporal , " since generals rarely fought alongside their men . By such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , Napoleon bound them to him ; without this , they would never have met his extraordinary demands . Afterward the young general said to one officer : " They have seen nothing yet . ... In our days no one has conceived anything great ; it is for me to set the example . " Those fantasies of glory every schoolboy has ? they could be made real ! In only a year Napoleon had driven the Austrians out of northern Italy and to within sight of Vienna . They sued for peace . Napoleon sent back to Paris cargoes of treasure from Italy , including its art : Caravaggios , Botticellis , Giottos , Tintorettos , even the four bronze horses from Venice 's Basilica of San Marco . He returned there himself , the man of the hour . THE YOUNG GENERAL now sought a new field for action . He chose Egypt . To seize it would cripple British interests in the Mediterranean , provide a stepping-stone to India . Surely he remembered those schoolbooks @#  | describing Alexander the Great ; like Alexander , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would begin the study of Egyptology , bring a new Egyptian fashion to the salons of Paris . Its impact on Egypt would be even greater . Cairo had changed in the years since I had seen it last . It seemed to bulge with swirling tides of people , honking cars . Helmeted soldiers with bayoneted weapons seemed everywhere . Some things endured : the dust and special smells , the evening breeze off the Nile , the sun dropping like a great orange coin into some slot in the earth . I drove to the edge of the city , where new houses and freshly cut roads edged into fields of maize . " Here , " my guide said , " this is the battlefield . " We scanned the horizon , then climbed atop the car and looked again . There ! In the distance thumbnail-size triangles , dark gray in the haze . Fighting here , Napoleon had exhorted his men by referring to those distant pyramids : " Soldiers , 40 centuries look down on you ! " The enemy was a pushover : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in medieval fashion . Thousands of the enemy died , 30 Frenchmen . " The coming of Napoleon was a shock to us , " a Cairo University professor said . " Before , we thought what we had was the best in the world , and that we were the masters of everything . We thought of ourselves not as nations but as Muslims ; we lived in the Muslim home , Darul-Islam ; everything else was the place of the infidels . " If we were defeated , the reason must be first that we had forgotten the ways of God , committed sin ; and God had sent these people to punish us . Later we understood that the reason for our defeat was the difference between the medieval and modern world . We began to watch the French : their courts , their doctors , even their cabarets . " This is what was behind the so-called modernization of our country in the 19th century . The English would occupy us later , but the French stayed in our minds : the idea of the French Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old ladies of our elite class speak French . " If Napoleon shocked Egypt , he would himself receive a shock there . An officer confided to him what most others knew : tbruary 1982 Napoleon Josephine was unfaithful ; she was often seen in Paris with a dashing and amusing young hussar , Hippolyte Charles . " I have great private unhappiness , " Napoleon wrote to brother Joseph , " the veil has at last quite fallen from my eyes . " From this time he seemed to become more brutal . On a campaign into Syria he ordered the massacre of 3,000 prisoners of war at Jaffa ; when that campaign proved unsuccessful , he slipped away from Egypt , leaving his stranded army under the command of another general ? who was so informed only after Napoleon left . MY HELICOPTER crossed a ridge in the Swiss Alps , dropped through the mist , paused on the snow-covered courtyard of the 900-year-old hospice of the Great St. Bernard Pass . A monastery door popped open , a monk stepped out , his cassock fluttering in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and led me inside . The rapid crossing of this pass in May 1800 , when there was still snow , was among Napoleon 's most dramatic exploits . He had been back in Paris only seven months when a new Austrian threat sent him marching again toward Italy . He had used the time well : He had joined in a coup d'etat that overthrew the old republican government ; had emerged as one of three consuls governing France , then became First Consul . The general who arrived here was also his country 's political leader . " He crossed in one day , " the abbot said . " He stopped here to rest , to eat , to drink . We have only a few souvenirs : the room where , tradition says , he rested ; a tomb he ordered built for one of his generals . " Life has changed at the hospice since Napoleon 's day . A tunnel was built under the pass in the 1960s ; the monks no longer have travelers to rescue . Now they hold retreats for local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs ? no longer needed , except for the tourist season . They stay in the valley in winter . But some things endure . The congregation had cooperated with Napoleon : " We still have farms given us by Napoleon , lands to support us , in Italy . " In the valley below the hospice I found another souvenir of Napoleon : an unpaid 157  | bill . The village of Bourg St. Pierre was pressing for payment . The village lawyer explained . " He needed mule drivers , men to help with the artillery . He agreed to pay . Here is his letter : I will reimburse you for everything . . . . This is only just . ' " But he became occupied ; only part was paid . The interest on the unpaid part is substantial . I wrote the President of France , and the French consul in Geneva has made inquiries . " The lawyer smiled : " It is not a question of money , but of closing an issue . " I wished him well , then followed Napoleon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Austrian army . Napoleon would in time have himself crowned King of Italy and install Josephine 's son , Eugene , as his viceroy . Eugene would never disappoint him ; the Italians would . " Napoleon despised us , " Professor Carlo Capra of the University of Milan said . " He once wrote to Prince Eugene that he knew more in his little finger than all the Italians put together . On another occasion he said that in the whole kingdom of Italy , there were only two men of character . He may have had reason : We were used to being conquered , to dealing slyly with those who conquered us . " Whatever his feelings , Napoleon shaped the course of Italian history . " He rather rudely awoke us from a sleep , " the professor said . " He abolished feudalism , gave us a constitution , provided opportunities for a new middle class . The 20 years the French were here are also considered the beginning of the Risorgimento , the movement that led to the unification of Italy ; Napoleon took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three . Even today , in our laws and government , we can see his framework . " IT WAS IN ITALY that Napoleon first began to put into practice his ideas on government ; it was back in France , its own administration shattered by years of turmoil , that he turned his full attention to implementing those ideas . " What he tried to do , " a historian told me , " was to strip the government down and organize it ? as if it were an army , as he organized himself . To simplify , codify . " The vast structure he created has shaped France since that day . He worked furiously , calling in panels of experts , dictating to four secretaries at once , sleeping little . One result : his Code Napoleon . In an office above the Seine a distinguished lawyer held up a small red volume containing the civil code of France . " Twenty-three hundred articles . At least half remain unchanged ; little concerning property has been changed . It was drawn up by four lawyers ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleverness of Napoleon is shown here ; he named two conservatives and two liberals . The laws reflect this compromise . "  | He centralized government . Prefects of the country 's 83 departments were appointed by him , as were subprefects and mayors . To this day a city can not build a road or a bridge without approval from Paris . He created the first modern bureaucracy ; a national civil service ; the Bank of France , which remains the central financial institution of the country ; a tax system that persisted into this century . He centralized and standardized education , hospitals , began a vast public-works program . Nothing seemed to escape his eye . He signed an agreement with the pope , paying the clergy 's salaries ; regulated Protestant churches and paid their ministers ; took the Jewish community under protection and summoned a Sanhedrin . " It bothered him , " a rabbi said , " when he heard that the Jews were a nation within a nation , with their own customs . He wanted to assimilate them . It was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is typical of France ; we have a great rabbi of the country , and regional rabbis . Almost like prefects . " Along with reform came measures of control : secret police , censorship , and the arrest of some political enemies . Still , he brought prosperity , stability ; and promised to every man " careers open to talent . " The First Consul was France 's most popular man . " I am so much identified with our . . . institutions . . . that no one would know how to separate me from them , " he wrote later . Not until last year , when a new socialist president , pledged to decentralize government , was elected , did anyone begin to seriously tamper with that structure . ON DECEMBER 2 , 1804 , Napoleon and his family , all gorgeously tailored , entered Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris for his coronation as Emperor of the French . " If only our father could see us now , " he whispered to brother Joseph . It was a splendid ceremony , but had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Josephine . Joseph had threatened to absent himself if she was crowned empress ; his sisters had at first refused to carry her train , but then agreed to " support it . " One of the sisters , it is said , gave a vicious tug on that flowing train @# as Josephine approached the altar , almost upsetting her . There was squabbling over titles ? in one row sister Caroline had to faint before Napoleon yielded . His mother wanted a title too . Napoleon thought hard , came up with altesse imperiale , madame , mere de l'empereur ? which courtiers quickly shortened to madame mere , or madame mother . Napoleon had his own complaints : " Joseph 's daughters do n't even know yet that I am Emperor ? they call me Consul . . . . little Napoleon his nephew , when he goes past the grenadiers . . . shouts to them Long live Nonon the soldier . ' " As for his family 's criticism of Josephine : " They say my wife is untrustworthy and her children 's attentions insincere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old uncle ; that sweetens my life . I 'm growing old , I 'm thirtysix . I want some peace and quiet . " The peace he sought , evidently , was domestic . A FEW MILES EAST OF BRNO , Czechoslovakia , amid rolling farmland and little hills , there is a hillock with two trees on it . If you go there on a cold and snowy day , when the land lies bleak and the trees bare , and there 's morning mist and a red sun , you will see the battlefield of Austerlitz as he saw it . When that sun rose on December 2 , 1805 , two great armies faced each other , Napoleon 's Grande Armee and the combined armies of Austria and Russia ? a total of 158,000 men , 400 cannon . When the sun set , 11,000 Russians , 2,000 Austrians , 1,300 French lay dead on the cold earth . The tsar was preparing to retreat toward Russia , the Austrian emperor to seek a treaty . How did he do it ? " He had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veteran himself . " Every battle was fresh . He always sought to concentrate his forces , but once a battle began , there was no pattern . What he really did was sit back and wait for the enemy to make a mistake . His policy : One engages , one waits , one sees . Austerlitz was the classic example . The Russians weakened their center to attack his flank ; he saw the weakness , made his attack there , rolled them up . " He prepared his campaigns carefully . He  | was known to crawl over his maps on all fours , dividers in hand , measuring distances , studying terrain ; so intent he sometimes bumped heads with his map expert , Basler d'Albe , also on all fours . He would at times explode in anger : He demanded performance , refused to take " no " for an answer . He knocked one marshal 's head against a stone wall , knocked another to the floor , hit others with his riding crop . And there was that memory , that intellect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Louis XIV and Colbert would write : Monsieur , you will please do all things which are deemed necessary so my glory will be served at its best . ' Napoleon would write : Monsieur , you will ensure that 15,000 reserve horses will be in Prague 14 September . You will ensure that this order is carefully executed and controlled . And I will check it myself . ' " Modern ! Concise ! Precise ! Like mathematics , music , like Bach ! " And so victory followed victory : Jena and Auerstadt against the Prussians ; Heilsberg and Friedland against the Russians ; Wagram against the Austrians . THERE WAS an unexpected heavy snow when I arrived in Vienna . It quietened the lovely old capital . Children appeared with wooden sleds ; women turned their faces from the wind-driven snow ; vaned caps on chimneys  | spun this way , that way . The city , with its Habsburg monuments , holds a great sense of the past , and of loss . " Those Napoleonic wars remain in our consciousness , " an Austrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time that , in the end , we won a war . In those days we had the great army of a great empire ; since 1918 we have had the small army of a small country . " A distinguished historian said : " You might describe us now as a small , neutral , little-bit-ambitious state . We do n't know what will happen tomorrow , whether the Russians will invade . We have a great fear , always , of the day people will die . " The Schonbrunn Palace , on Vienna 's outskirts , has its own tale of loss . It was after the Battle of Wagram that Napoleon decided to divorce Josephine ; she had produced no child , and an emperor must have an heir . He took the hand of Marie Louise , 18-year-old daughter of the Emperor of Austria . He explained to a critic : " This is . . . a political action , and one to which I have given considerable thought . You do n't like this marriage ? I do . I regard it as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory of Austerlitz . " Surprisingly , the marriage turned into a love match , and Marie Louise promptly produced an heir , little Napoleon . " He has my chest , my mouth , and my eyes , " the emperor exulted , and decreed the child King of Rome . But when Napoleon 's world fell apart , Marie Louise and the child would be taken from him by her father ? the boy to Schonbrunn . There was a bitter wind on the day I visited the palace ; few visitors were about . I tried to conjure up the boy 's life there . He was not a prisoner , but in a " special position . " His Austrian tutor decreed that " It is necessary to banish everything that might remind him of the life he has led until now . " Another remarked , " He knows a great deal about the past , but in this connection maintains a silence . . . quite extraordinary in a child . " This silence would break when he in time received news of his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely ignored by his mother , died of the Habsburgs ' disease , tuberculosis , at the age of 21 . But his story does not end there . " Marie Louise 's sister-in-law , the Archduchess Sophie , had a great sentiment for him , " a scholar told me . " There were rumors . People said he was the father of her children , Maximilian of Mexico , the Emperor Franz Josef . Her husband was a very modest figure ; the boy , very handsome . " THE MARRIAGE to Marie Louise marked a turning point in Napoleon 's fortunes . Historian Owen Connelly told me : " In a way , Marie Louise killed him . Before , everybody ? even Josephine ? had been compartmentalized . But Marie Louise made him so happy that he lost the compulsion to work . " The preeminent French Napoleonic scholar , Jean Tulard of the Sorbonne , said : " He was a realist , except for his women . After his marriage with Marie Louise , he was blinded by his love and did not think any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his destiny . " He was physically worn out , distempered . He used to take very hot baths . Too much l'amour . He did not go to Spain , where he was needed , not because he was afraid but because he was unsure . And he was with Marie Louise , and she was more pleasant than the Spanish . " The tough , scrawny Corsican boy , ridden with ambition , given to pouring out his feelings to a woman he loved , had vanished ; in his place was a paunchy , middle-aged man . Poor Josephine : When he had loved her , she had been unfaithful ; when he decided to leave her , she tried to cling to him . At Malmaison , their country house outside Paris , her bedroom bespeaks that divorce . " Before , " curator Gerard Hubert said , " it was rectangular and decorated with frescoes ; after the divorce she used fabrics to cover 165  | over the frescoes and make the room round . " She had a tiny mouth , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had terrible teeth . She never laughed wholeheartedly , because of these teeth . " She had the most incredible , beautiful voice . Napoleon was very nervous and often had problems falling asleep . And he very often in bed asked her to read him something . And she would start reading him a novel or something , and he would fall asleep . " The memories of Josephine are everywhere here : the mirror in which she looked to change clothes three times a day ; a bill for three dozen gloves , extra thin , and three dozen , fine ; the bonnets , the little scarves and shawls ; the dresses , of which she had 800 just after the divorce , 189 at her death . And her rose garden . Raised amid flowers in the Caribbean , she would die amid flowers in the Paris suburbs . ONE DAY IN PARIS I went to the Grand Palais to see an exhibition of artworks that had recently been acquired by the French government . One room was filled by portraits of Napoleon and his family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was as if a dinner party were about to commence . All were in elegant costume , for once Napoleon had most of Europe under his control , he parceled it out , Corsican style , to his brothers and sisters . There was Joseph , King of Spain ; Louis , King of Holland , and his wife , Hortense ; Jerome , King of Westphalia ; Caroline 's husband , Murat , King of Naples ; Elisa , Grand Duchess of Tuscany . All but Elisa would disappoint Napoleon . The brothers would identify with their subjects , rather than him ; Caroline and Murat would pursue their own ambitions . " My  | family , " Napoleon would later recall , " have not helped me . " Of all the failures , brother Joseph 's in Spain was the most costly . " I KNOW NOTHING of Napoleon , " the old soldier said , " but a lot about the civil war . I was with Franco , but not convinced ; a stroke of bad luck .

" The bullet went through the right lung and still is in the left . " Just then came a crack of thunder . The old soldier and the four men seated at a table playing guinote turned in their chairs to look at the door . " I had forgotten the sound , " the old soldier said . " It has been so long since rain . " The cardplayers resumed playing . The town , a pocket of resistance against Napoleon , had forgotten the emperor ; the emperor never forgot the Spanish .

And there was a nationalism , a Spanish pride : Napoleon had kicked out our kings and imposed his own kin . " So when our army was dispersed , the people began to fight . The guerrilla ? little war ? commenced ; the word was first used at that time . " Napoleon had believed 80,000 troops would hold Spain ; before the end the number reached 320,000 .

" When Napoleon crossed the River Neman into Russia on June 24 , 1812 , he realized he was embarking on his " greatest and most difficult enterprise . " He had drawn on other nations to triple the size of his army , from some 200,000 to 600,000 . He had assembled thousands of supply wagons , vast herds of cattle and oxen , 30,000 artillery horses , 80,000 cavalry horses . Regiments had been instructed to be self-sufficient , to have their own masons , bakers , tailors , shoemakers , gunsmiths : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet ... .

" Our war leader , Marshal Kutuzov , said this policy would not work with such large armies ; one must defeat with several battles , extended in time and space . So Kutuzov used retreat , wide maneuver , counteroffensive ; he delivered different blows with different formations , including bands of partisans . Napoleon met here the resistance not only of the army , but also of the whole people . All sought to drive the invader from the motherland . " The Russian Army did turn to fight , at Borodino , 70 miles from Moscow . " A massacre , " as the general described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A mass of blood and flesh . And one can only wonder : Was it a defeat or a victory for the Russian February 1982 Napoleon 173  | Army . The scientists discuss it till now . " Personally , I think it was Kutuzov 's victory . He retreated to Moscow , but the Russian Army was not destroyed . And as he retreated again from Moscow , he gained reserves , while Napoleon , as he advanced , was losing both men and supplies . " At 2 p.m. on 14 September Napoleon rode up Poklonnaya Hill and looked down on the glistening gold cupolas of Moscow : " Here at last is the famous city ! " He expected to be met by a delegation of citizens ; instead he found the city deserted . That night the fires began ; they raged for five days . In time it became clear that the Russian governor had ordered the burning . Napoleon wrote the tsar , Alexander I : " The beautiful city of Moscow is no more . ... Such conduct is atrocious and without reason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Smolensk . " He was beginning to learn something of the Russian character . FOR FIVE WEEKS Napoleon lingered in the Kremlin , hoping to negotiate with Alexander . From the tsar in St. Petersburg , there came only silence . On October 19 Napoleon began his retreat over the same ravished path he had come . The great column , stretching over 50 miles , soon passed again over the battlefield of Borodino . It " was covered with the debris of helmets , cuirasses , wheels , weapons , rags of uniforms ? and 30,000 corpses half-eaten by wolves ! " The great column was constantly harassed by Cossacks and partisans . One Russian officer remembered the sight of Napoleon passing with his Old Guard : " I shall never forget the easy gait and the impressive bearing . . . . In their tall bearskin caps , blue uniforms with white straps , and red plumes and epaulettes , they looked like poppies amidst the snowy fields . . . . " The proud sight was not to last . Now the snow became heavier , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned to trap the army . They knocked down the bridges , fortified the banks . Napoleon , in a rare burst of energy , found an undefended crossing , threw up two bridges using lumber ripped from village houses . For two days the army crossed ; on the third came panic . Under Russian fire , stragglers , wounded , and camp followers fought to cross . An officer recorded what happened then : " The strongest threw into the river those who were weaker , and . . . trampled underfoot all the sick whom they found in their way . . . . Others , hoping to save themselves by swimming , were frozen in the middle of the river , or perished by placing themselves on pieces of ice , which sunk to the bottom . Thousands and thousands . . . were lost . " Finally the last bridge was set afire to prevent the Russians from crossing . The officer National Geographic , February 1982  | would remember , always , the terrible cries and groans from those left behind . THERE WAS SNOW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I reached the place of that crossing , the village of Studenka . There are about 50 houses , a hundred inhabitants , mostly old . The young go off to study and to work in the larger towns nearby . The village seemed little changed from Napoleon 's time : houses with pretty Russian window frames , horse-drawn sledges bearing timber and hay , an old man carrying buckets of water on a yoke . And that great silence , save for the wind , of the Russian countryside . Villagers remembered World War II , for the Germans had come this way too . They recalled the sound of gunfire at night as Germans and partisans fought , and how , when the German soldiers retreated , they set fire to the houses . They all knew of Napoleon and his passage , and some had unearthed souvenirs as they tilled their small plots . The Bacturas were one such family . " I was digging to plant , " Madame Bactura said , " when I saw metal . We dug carefully . We found a saddle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the blade disintegrated . But the handle , when polished , began to shine . " These were given to a museum . One object they had kept , a metal toy soldier , three inches high . They placed it proudly on the kitchen table . They thought it a memento of Napoleon 's passage , perhaps a token given to a soldier on his discharge . To me it looked more recent ; never mind ? concerning great events , a souvenir is a souvenir . As I left , the family pressed on me bread , salt pork fat , a handful of salt . I could not help thinking that Napoleon 's starving soldiers , passing here , would have killed for such a gift . At Studenka the army , what remained of it , had escaped . But now terrible frosts set in , with temperatures of 30 and 40 degrees below zero . Russian officers , to save their feet , stuck them in the fur hats of French grenadiers , which littered the road . The French built shelters with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On December 14 , the Grande Armee de la Russie recrossed the Neman . It numbered only 30,000 . Napoleon was not with it ; he had departed for Paris . He confided to an aide : " Perhaps I made a mistake in going to Moscow , perhaps I should not have stayed there long ; but there is only a step from the sublime to the ridiculous , and it is up to posterity to judge . " Napoleon did not consider himself finished . He raised a new army , was defeated at Leipzig in 1813 , raised another , and in 179  | 1814 began a chesslike defense of France against the armies of Russia , Prussia , Austria , Great Britain . But Paris was not Moscow ; on the arrival of the enemy , it quickly surrendered and was occupied . Napoleon was exiled to Elba , a small island off the coast of Italy . It was to be " a separate principality which he shall possess in full sovereignty and property " for the rest of his life ? a lilliputian empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then slipped away back to France . His mother encouraged him : " Go , my son , fulfill your destiny , you were not made to die on this island . " Sister Pauline gave him her diamonds . The soldiers sent to arrest him embraced him . A FEW DAYS BEFORE the 166th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo , I entered a restaurant on the old battlefield in Belgium and was surprised to find , perched on a barstool , in full uniform , a soldier of the First Regiment of Grenadiers of the Imperial Guard . The grenadier was Gerard Vandeville , a postal worker from Soignies . He told me he belonged to a Napoleon marching club in his town , and that there were perhaps 50 such groups in Belgium . His group marches about 15 times a year , adding a festive note to small-town celebrations . " I enjoy the marching , the uniform , the re-creation of history . Come back Thursday , the anniversary , and you 'll see more of us . " And so on the anniversary I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with costumed soldiers , the " last regiment " of Waterloo . We went from monument to monument , placing flowers on each . At one a small crowd had gathered . There were French flags and the flags of the Walloons , Belgium 's French-speaking people . There were impassioned speeches , cries of " Vive la France ! " " They want some link with France , " the mayor of a small town said . " But it is too late . Napoleon could have done it in 1815 , but now it is too late . " Indeed , Napoleon could have done it , almost did . I stood where he stood and tried to imagine the scene on the morning of June 18 , 1815 . Two armies on two ridges , 1,500 yards apart : 100,000 infantrymen , 28,000 cavalrymen , 13,000 gunners serving 400 cannon . One man remembered the sound of the two armies preparing to fight as the " distant murmur of the waves of the sea , beating against some ironbound coast . " Wellington , as was his wont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reinforced . But the emperor was not at all the same man who had commanded the army at Austerlitz . " After his return from Moscow , " wrote one officer , " those who saw most of him noticed a great change in his physical and moral constitution . . . I did not find the @#  | same consistency in his ideas or the same strength in his character ... only inconsequent leaps of imagination . " He would at times lose control of the battle , allowing generals to make mistakes he could not correct . Now he waited for the sun to dry the raindamp ground : Cannonballs stuck in wet ground ; bounced and rolled and killed and maimed on dry ground . At 11:30 the great cannonade began . Wellington had placed his men behind the ridge , so the projectiles whistled past over their heads . Three great attacks followed : At 1:30 four divisions were thrown against Wellington 's left center ; somehow they were deployed in an outdated formation that exposed too many to cannon fire . They were bloodily repulsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right center . " Not a man present who survived could have forgotten in after life the awful grandeur of that charge , " one British officer would write . The British had drawn themselves up into 20 great squares , bristling with bayonets . The French cuirassiers , with their shining breastplates , helmets , and swords , came at a trot , then a gallop ? then balked . Through a blunder , no infantry or artillery had accompanied them . Without cannon or muskets to blast holes in those stalwart squares , the cavalrymen could only circle them , taunt , threaten . The last great attack would come at 7 p.m . It was at about this time that a dark mass could be seen off to the northeast . Napoleon put out word that it was Marshal Grouchy with his reinforcements ; in truth , that general had ignored the pleas of his officers to march to the sound of the cannon , and so missed the main battle . After cannonading erupted from the dark mass , the French knew the truth . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now personally led forward , for a time , nine battalions of his cherished Imperial Guard , his last reserve . British officers watched coolly as the great column , 80 men abreast , marched steadily toward them , a river of blue coats , great bearskin hats , shining bayonets . When the French drew near , the British officers ordered soldiers concealed amid standing corn to stand and fire . The musket fire tore into that great blue column . The guard hesitated , turned , retreated . " La Garde recule ! ? The Guard recoils ! " The cry swept through the French Army . Wellington sensed the moment , waved his hat forward . The British and their allies , with a cheer and bayonets , charged . The French Army broke , swept southward in retreat , Napoleon among them . Still , as Wellington said , it had been the " damndest near-run thing you ever saw in your life . " The implacable spirit of the British and the bloodiness of the battle were caught in letters home . One officer wrote : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart , and poor Ford was shot through the spine of his back but did not die for a short time after he was carried away . Poor Clarke lost his left arm , and I am much afraid Browne will lose his leg , he is shot through the upper part of the thigh and the bone terribly shattered . There are eight more of our officers wounded , but all doing well except little Thornhill , who was wounded through the head . " Napoleon returned to Paris , offered a new provisional government his services as a mere general . The government rejected the offer . He thought for a time of leaving for America , but was unable to arrange a guarantee of safe passage . America was spared the emperor 's energies . Three weeks later at Rochefort , Napoleon surrendered himself to Captain Maitland of H.M.S. Bellerophon , handing him a letter for the prince regent of Great Britain . It asked for asylum : " I have finished my political career , and I come , like Themistocles , to sit at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the protection of . . . Your Royal Highness , as the most powerful , constant and generous of my enemies . " The British government had another plan . THE ROYAL MAIL SHIP St. Helena sounded her whistle and slipped away from the dock in Cape Town , South Africa . The 30 or so passengers waved to a handful of wellwishers below ; crewmen coiled the lines ; the island song came over the loudspeakers : My heart is drifting southward , to my home down in the sea ; to the isle of St. Helena , where my loved one waits forme . The tiny island ? 47 square miles ? lies 181  | 1,200 miles from Africa , 2,000 miles from South America , and is even more isolated today than in Napoleon 's time . In his day , sailing ships regularly resupplied there ; today only the R.M.S. St. Helena , a converted Canadian coaster , provides a regular link with the outside world . The ship plies every month or so from Avonmouth , England , to Cape Town and back . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night the officers wore " Red Sea rig " : black trousers , cummerbund , crisp white shirt open at the collar , rank displayed on the shoulders . The passengers included a young American Mormon who had come to microfilm the island 's genealogical records , a retired police superintendent from Rhodesia ( " Do n't you dare mention that other name , I 'll punch you ! " ) , an elegant Englishwoman of mature years who excelled at whist ( " Queen Mum , " the others would soon call her ) , a retired British officer ( " Major Michael " ? he wore the tie of the Royal Artillery and , when anyone said anything amusing , would allow the monocle in his left eye to pop out and fall the length of its black cord ) , a chief justice , the new governor and his lady . We were five days at sea . We saw flying fish , a spouting whale , but no other ships . ON THE FIFTH MORNING the steward 's knock came before dawn . I stuck my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black against the dark blue sky , it stood like a fortress or a prison . How Napoleon 's heart must have sunk . We went ashore as in his time : Launches brought us to the stone steps of the landing , waited , bobbing , until the sea paused at just the right level ; then we stepped ashore . Half the island seemed there , along with a band . They laughed when Major Michael , in trilby hat and clutching a cane , bobbled slightly on the wet landing . Queen Mum , for safety 's sake , was fitted into a harness and swung ashore by crane . The new governor was installed that very day . He wore a white uniform , plumed sun helmet ; was sworn in by the chief justice in wig and scarlet robes . Then , to the music of two tiny bands , he reviewed his troops : island policemen , Boy Scouts , Girl Guides , church groups , saluting each in pukka fashion . I had to think of Lowe , the governor in Napoleon 's time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a stickler for detail . My host was M. Gilbert Martineau , a French diplomat , author of books on Napoleon , and custodian of the French property on the island . He lives in Longwood , the house that Napoleon occupied . I had a cottage nearby . 185  | " I spend six or seven months a year on the island , " he told me . " A person without an interest in Napoleon would not like the job . St. Helena is part of the past . But all my life I 've thought of Napoleon as a hero . When I was a boy , there were huge paintings in my bedroom with scenes of his life . I knew everything about Napoleon . My greatgrandfather served in his wars . " I do my writing , do my work , take a walk in the garden by moonlight . I have to answer letters from all over the world ; 100 to 150 letters every mail . There is always a student doing a thesis who writes to me for information . I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm like a spider in the middle of a web . " He spoke of Napoleon 's exile from an admirer 's point of view . " They gave him a house , they gave him servants ; but it 's not a house , it 's a hall , a shack . Full of rats in those days . On the most unhealthy part of the island . Windy , wet . Money became so short he had to sell his silverware to pay his expenses . Conditions were frightful . One toilet for 30 persons . No water facilities ; it was carried in buckets . The meat came up from Jamestown , the port ; sometimes it arrived rotten . " During the first years he worked rather well , writing , dictating . Then he became bored so that he seldom worked . The worries , certainly , made things worse . " Do you realize that once he did n't leave Longwood for nearly two years ! He was protesting against the way there were soldiers everywhere with telescopes , watching him . And Lowe had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island where he could ride by himself ; the rest of the time he had to be escorted by a British officer . " Rather than do that , ' he said , I would rather stay indoors . ' And when he did n't go out , Lowe decided he had to show himself to an officer twice a day . Like a prisoner . He said no . He locked the doors and said , I will not allow them to come inside my house . ' For the last two years not an Englishman went into that house , not one except for the doctors assigned to treat him . " No doubt , there was deterioration by loneliness . I think that he gave up at the end . The body was opened . They found a little hole the size of a finger in his stomach . I  | do n't know if it was an ulcer or a cancer . " And so Napoleon died on May 5 , 1821 ; his last words , " France . . . armee . . . tete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the island . In 1840 , at the request of the French government , his remains were transported to Paris , where they lie today in that great tomb in the Invalides . There on May 5 each year , the anniversary of his death , there is a memorial Mass , the roll of drums , men with bemedaled chests . Gathered are the descendants of the Bonapartes and admirers of Napoleon . There is Prince Napoleon , descendant of Jerome , tall , stately , head of the Bonaparte family today , a veteran of the Foreign Legion and the French Resistance ; there is Count Walewski , direct descendant of Napoleon and Polish beauty Marie Walewska , an electrical engineer , rumpled , kindly ; there is Prince Napoleon Murat , descendant of Caroline and Murat , a film producer , as spirited and elegantly tailored as his cavalry forebear . There , in the adjacent museum , lie the weapons and trophies of the Grande Armee , and personal things of Napoleon . But I had felt closer to Napoleon on St. Helena . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees bent by the wind , the red and yellow birds , and how when the rain came the hibiscus would close ; and the mist , cutting off the mountains and the sea ; and then the murmur of @#  | the wind through the scrubwood . Napoleon had said : " A great reputation is like a great sound .... Laws , institutions , monuments , nations perish , but the sound endures and echoes down the generations . " I liked to walk that hill , to find some solitary place and look down on the sea that stretched on and on until it met the sky . " I feel the infinite in myself , " Napoleon said . Indeed , his achievements were staggering . " He has given us the example of all that man can do with force , and everything he may dare with genius , " an old enemy conceded . " The mightiest breath of life which ever animated human clay , " another said . He had carried the ideas of the French Revolution throughout Europe , given France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , developed mass armies , ruled most of the Continent for a decade . He had envisioned a Europe united under one law , one rule , " composed of one and the same family . " Following Napoleon , I had liked him at first , disliked his later actions , finally felt pity . In those early letters , when he and all about him seemed young , he had written : " What is the future ? What is the past ? What are we ? What magic liquid is it that shuts us in , and hides from us the things that we ought most to know ? We move and live and die in the midst of miracles . " The greatest miracles are life and love : It was a pity he turned his back on both .
