So 105 TIME readers were revolted by the ancient Chinese practice of eating healthy dogs , fattened for the table ( ( LETTERS , Oct. 30 ) ) . Many of those people probably enjoy crab cakes or crab gumbo , made from the scavengers of our bays , to which the most putrid bait is attractive . It is a puzzlement . I 've never eaten dog , but I have eaten escargot , crawfish , catfish , alligator , rattlesnake , possum and coon . <P> Jim Curran <P> Wortham , Texas
