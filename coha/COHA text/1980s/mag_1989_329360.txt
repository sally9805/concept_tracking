Can former National Security Adviser John Poindexter accomplish what Oliver North could not : force Ronald Reagan or George Bush into a courtroom grilling about the Iran-contra scandal ? Last week Poindexter 's lawyer , Frederick Robinson , insisted that Reagan had ordered the admiral to tell Congress that the NSC staff was not violating restrictions on U.S. aid to the contras at a time when , in fact , it was . He also contended that Poindexter had briefed Bush about each White House meeting on Iran-contra that the then Vice President had missed . If so , Bush 's knowledge might be far more extensive than he has admitted . <P> Federal Judge Gerhard Gesell killed North 's subpoenas for Reagan and Bush , partly because North rarely met with either the President or the Vice President . But Poindexter saw Reagan almost daily , and he dealt regularly with Bush . The decision on who must testify in Poindexter 's trial will be made by Federal Judge Harold Greene , who reminded Robinson that " so far , ( ( Reagan ) ) has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lawyer : " No , but we 're looking forward to it , your honor .
