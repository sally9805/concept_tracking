In London , a show of masterly formal portraits by Van Dyck <P> The peculiar achievement of Sir Anthony van Dyck was to have invented the English gentleman-not the mild , knobbly , pink creature one sees beneath its bowler in the street , but the now vanishing archetype of aristocracy , calm and straight as a Purdey gun barrel , with the look of arrogant security guaranteed to paralyze all lesser breeds from Calais to Peshawar . This invention began in 1632 , when Van Dyck , an ex-assistant of the greatest court painter of his age , Peter Paul Rubens , arrived in London . It ended with his death at the age of 42 , in 1641 . In between came seven years of service to the court of Charles I and his wife Queen Henrietta Maria , during which Van Dyck attained the kind of success that few artists of the time could imagine . Inundated with commissions , eulogized by poets , fluent and tireless , he helped set the cultural standards of the Caroline age . <P> Standing before Van Dyck 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt " the Luck to be astonish 'd in the righte Place . " The current exhibition of Van Dyck 's English portraits , organized by Art Historian Oliver Millar at the National Portrait Gallery in London , shows how well Van Dyck 's fluency has lasted . It is a delectable exhibition , though cramped and clumsily installed , and it makes one realize how far the tradition of formal portraiture has declined since the days when Van Dyck epitomized it . <P> Certainly , Van Dyck knew how to make his sitters look handsomer than they were . Any cosmetician can do that ; it is part of the ordinary transaction that painting and photography have with reality . Before photography , when one 's idea of a strange face had to be set up by painting , the disparity between the evidence of the eye and the speech of the brush could sometimes come as a shock . One of Prince Rupert 's sisters , who knew Queen Henrietta Maria only through the portraits of Van Dyck , was dismayed to meet a short woman with crooked shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mouth " like guns from a fort . " <P> Another of Van Dyck 's clients , however , the Countess of Sussex , lamented that he had made her look " very ill-favourede , " stout in the cheeks , like one of the winds huffing and blowing . " But truely , " she conceded , " I thinke it t is lyke the originale . " The fact is that flattery is not a word that can quickly be defined , at least in portraiture . How it is used , what it means , depends on how the sitter feels about himself and how posterity will feel about the sitter . Our own bias , in a post-Freudian age , is toward portraits that show a " truth " about the sitter that the sitter was not willing to admit . But that is not how the portraitists of the 16th , 17th or 18th centuries saw their work .
