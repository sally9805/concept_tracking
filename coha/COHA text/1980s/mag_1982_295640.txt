A Kremlin aide talks about Reagan , the MX and Afghanistan <P> Georgi Arbatov , 59 , worked closely with General Secretary Yuri Andropov from 1964 to 1967 , when , as a young research scholar , Arbatov joined the Central Committee 's department in charge of relations with other Communist parties . Four years later , Arbatov founded the Institute of the U.S.A. and Canada , an influential policy-related think tank that studies all aspects of U.S. life . In an exclusive interview in his Moscow office last week with TIME Moscow Bureau Chief Erik Amfitheatrof and Reporter Felix Rosenthal , Arbatov predictably blamed the U.S. for fueling the arms race . He stressed the Soviet Union 's opposition to the MX missile , but he indicated that there was a Soviet willingness to find a political solution to the presence of some 100,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan . Excerpts : <P> Q. Did the visit of Vice President Bush and Secretary of State Shultz to Moscow for Brezhnev 's funeral , and their talk with General Secretary Andropov , strike Soviet leaders as an overture that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned from all our experience with the U.S. not to come to hasty conclusions . One visit and some good words , while they were listened to carefully , did not give grounds for far-reaching conclusions . <P> Q. How does the new leadership feel U.S.-Soviet relations can be mended ? <P> A. We are ready to improve relations with the U.S. , but we do n't think we owe you anything or that preconditions should be put to us by American leaders , including Secretary Shultz . We do n't have to prove first that we are good boys , and only then will you be kind enough to talk about normalizing relations . You demand from us that we yield at the Geneva arms talks , at Madrid , over human rights , Afghanistan and Poland . We could make a similar menu of demands to the U.S. as a precondition , but we do n't . <P> Q. Will Soviet foreign policy change under Andropov ? <P> A. We have not had a change of government-nor a coup d ' tat ! The change of leader can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a collective leadership in the Soviet Union for years . The Central Committee and the Politburo were the chief decision-making bodies under Brezhnev , and they will be under Andropov . <P> Q. The U.S. has been stressing regional issues like Afghanistan and Poland , and you put stress on the arms race . How can this difference be reconciled ? <P> A. I would not make such distinctions . The major issue in Soviet-American relations is war and peace . The problem of survival . There was a time when the arms race was a consequence of bad political relations . But I think that now bad political relations have become a consequence of the arms race . As to Afghanistan and Poland , we do n't expect Americans to have our view of events there . But whatever their views , I do n't think Poland and Afghanistan must become a motive for an unlimited arms race . <P> Q. If Soviet leaders want a return to dtente , as Andropov has said , why do they keep using terms like " the imperialist threat " ?   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
