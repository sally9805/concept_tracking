In neighboring Japan , the postwar tradition has been for business to dictate and government to follow . In less developed Korea the opposite was true , certainly throughout the long reign of the late President Park Chung Hee from his 1961 military coup to assassination in October 1979. // With the change of government last year and the emergence of yet another national leader from the military ranks , the initial impression was that this systemn would not only continue but was being strengthened. // The new leadership energetically began a complete reorganization of industry , ordering some companies to close , others to merge. // But government officials and some of the businessmen involved insist that the initiative for this came from the private sector and was dictated by public opinion. // And , they also maintain that Korea is moving steadily toward a free market economy , even if it wasn ' t so already. // Korea ' s first postwar president , Syngman Rhee , was an independence leader who devoted his attention to politics and national integration while largely ignoring economics .

Undoubtedly Korea sustained the most amazing growth rates throughout the 1960s and 1970s . But there are some who say : " Imagine what these people could do if the government didn ' t stick its nose into everything. " // Il Sa kong , research director of the Korea Development Institute , argues that in the 1960s " firms didn ' t have the capital or the managerial experience , so the government had to lead . In general it worked well , although there were bad side effects . Still , we are where we are now because of it.

Now it is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave more to private initiative. // " I don ' t think last year ' s government measures show any change in official attitude toward developing a free economy . Left alone , the market would have sorted things out eventually . . . all the government did was to speed things up. " // Yes , agrees Kim Ip Sam , vice-president of the Korean Federation of industries , the initial impression was that the government was going to dictate the terms of an industrial reorganization. // " But then they discovered how complicated a job it was going to be , so they decided to let industry do the job. " // Last September the industries federation was asked to work out an overall program , now nearly complete . The basic idea is that big trading groups like Hyundai and Daewoo should consolidate in their main lines and not spread themselves over too many industrial sectors . Secondly , there should be less companies involved in each main line  --  competition but not duplicating overcapacity. // Mr. kim becomes extremely animated when the suggestion is made that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy. // " That ' s nonsense . We ' re not angels , of course . But this is basically an open society , where we can say and do what we want . As to the economy . . . well , we have to export to survive. // " Government officials can ' t do that . Military men can ' t do that . How can you sell products in uniform ? // " So , in order to survive we must export , and in order to export this country will basically have to be a free economy. " // Japan , he insists , has a controled economy , with business , government , and workers all pursuing a single national goal . Koreans , however , are too individualistic to work together well. // In a study of government involvement in business management , published last year by Harvard University . Il Sakong noted that " government policy response to changing conditions typically is closer to the alacrity of a crack air force unit scrambling to the attack than the lethargy usually associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first decision may prove misguided . But such costs are minimized by the flexibility in changing directions as the effects of the initial decision become apparent . The Korean policymaking style is not so much a deliberate one of careful planning and debate , but more of diving in , getting started , observing results and adjusting policy ( free of ideological hangups ) and repeating the process until the appropriate mix is found. " // He describes the whole process as " thinking on the run. " // A perfect example was last year ' s Changwon fiasco. // This goes back to 1975 when the government planned an industrial estate for machinery along Masan Bay on the southern coast . The centerpiece was to be a $600 million integrated plant manufacturing turbine generators , boilers , and other equipment for nuclear , thermal , and hydroelectric power stations. // Hyundai International , part of the powerful Hyundai trading group , won the contract but soon ran into trouble . By last year the construction was more than two years behind schedule and the project ' s debts exceeded assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue , the government first handed the task to the Daewoo Group , which quickly found it too big to handle. // Finally , the state-run Korea Electric Company was instaled as caretaler manager while efforts continued to sort out a mess which involved several dozen international creditors and licensees. // Officials now admit the original project smacked of " delusions of grandeur . " Its annual capacity for producing generating machinery would have been more than double the most optimistic estimates of domestic requirements , with no chance of offsetting exports. // American and German experts , called in to offer advice , said right away the project had to be scaled down considerably. // So , for the moment , Korea Electric is content to run the existing facilities to meet urgent existing orders , while the government tries to work out ways to pay for the whole thing. // //
