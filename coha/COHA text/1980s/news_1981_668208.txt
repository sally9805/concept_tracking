The hard click of snapping locks sounded the end of an era throughout the city last night . In accordance with a disputed order from headquarters to merge Boston ' s 12 police stations into five district offices , shiny new hasps that had been placed earlier on the doors of seven neighborhood stations were clamped shut . The final lock-up hit not only police stations that have stood for decades as brick and granite fortresses across the city , but also three fire stations . And 200 policemen and 200 firefighters also found themselves on the receiving end of the city ' s fiscal guillotine . Amid disgruntled mutterings , officers cleaned their lockers , leaving behind taped and faded newspaper clippings that trumpeted their arrests . They packed their files into cartons and lifted cabinets , radio equipment and computer consoles into patrol wagons . As closing time neared , their comments reflected dejection , dire predictions and , in off-the-record moments , anger . On the streets , residents expressed a combination of fear and sentimentality . " Nobody likes change , but you ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Sgt. Garrett Barry , desk officer at the Charlestown station and a member of the force for 35 years . " Not a helluva lot you can do about it . Headquarters made a determination and that ' s it . " On a nearby 1981 holiday schedule , an early July date was circled . Beside it was scrawled , " ? Prop 2 1/2 . " But time , and Mayor Kevin H. White , didn ' t wait for the tax- cutting proposal to take effect in July before they moved to trim the force ' s sails . The staffing at some of the stations had been pared down since departmental reorganization late last year . But the wholesale shutdown of the most visible component of police presence , the imposing brick and stone structures , was no less threatening to residents . They complained that response time will be longer , neighborliness will dissipate , and it won ' t be long before criminals figure it out . " All hell willbreak loose in a short time , " predicted Charlestown package store owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of the closings right away , " saidJoselyn Pratt , manager of the large Woolworth store in the center of the Jamaica Plain business district . " We had problems ( shoplifting ) when there were police patrols . You can now imagine what it ' s going to be without them . It ' s a scary situation , I can tell you that . " At Meridian Tobacco Shop in East Boston , employee Bill Matarazzo criticized Mayor White for closing the station 119 paces away while keeping open the nearby Little City Hall . " They don ' t do anything over there , " Matarazzo said . " Why doesn ' t he close it ? I ' ll tell you why . Because they ' re all Mayor White ' s political jobs . What ' s more important , a Little City Hall or a police station ? Let ' s be honest about it . " In Brighton , state Rep. Tom Gallagher joined others across the city calling for White to " cut the public relations staff and the political patronage machinery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutbacks on Proposition 2 1/2 , Gallagher said in a news conference on the steps of the Brighton station , " I believe it was going to happen all along . " The mood was sullen yesterday in the seven stations . Walking into the Meridian street station at East Boston was like discovering grandma ' s yellowing scrapbook in the attic . The walls were barren , save for curling pieces of tape that once held the four corners of posters , declarations , commendations , ordinances , announcements , prank notices , wives ' photographs and telephone numbers that tell the station ' s 50-year history . As did officers all across the city , Sgt. Louis Spina spent the day gathering papers in the East Boston office and trying to allay fears that the police were going out of business . " We got three cars , two bikes , detectives and a juvenile officer out there . And we will always be here . " He paused , surveyed his bleak surroundings , and deadpanned : " It ' s just a normal day - except that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Across the Formica desk , on the wall next to the pay telephone where many a midnight call for bail had been placed , was a homemade laquered plaque with its message written in glued-on alphabet soup letters . GOD could not be everywhere so He created the Policemen of Station 7 No one remembered where the plaque came from or when . In the back room , where a puddle of water from an unplugged soda machine covered scuff marks on linoleum , a less reconciled patrolman of 23 years predicted , " There will be more B &Es,; more rapes , more drug-buying and more everything . When the cat ' s away , the mice will play . " A sticker lifted from the pay telephone had been placed on the door of the vacant detectives ' office : " Sorry ! Temporarily out of service . " Across the city , in the 64-year-old Mattapan station on Morton street , Sgt. Richard Pugsley manned the one operable phone line , seemingly oblivious to the Mobile Operations officers lugging out the boxes and cabinets of files @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few telephones lay disconnected on the floor as a breeze tossed discarded papers about the offices . " I ' m sorry Ruth , but we are closing down at midnight tonight , " Pugsley told a regular caller . " Yep , everything will be gone from here . " Pugsley said goodbye , then added , " She calls about ten times a day , not having much to say . I ' d hate to see her phone bill . " Miles away , in the South Boston station on D Street , community service officer Charles Famolare pried his nameplate from above his office door and recalled how officers had chipped in time and money to refurbish the station five years ago . " I still remember seeing Capt . Allen laying the tile you are standing on on his hands and knees , " said Famolare . " We liked this station , so we took care of it like a home . " Moments later , as if transplanted from a Norman Rockwell painting , 8-year- old Kerry Parent , who lives down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say goodbye to Famolare . " Hey Uncle Charley ! Need any help ? " Parent yelled from the glass doors at the front of the station . Famolare , smiling , turned and tossed an empty bullet casing to the boy . " No , no thanks , Kerry . But you can keep this shell and maybe I ' ll see you later . " Parent stood beaming at the shell and said he was going to miss the copsfrom the commanding , granite station in Southie . " I know a bunch of thembecause they are good to me . Uncle Charley , Eddie Doyle , they are good guys , " said Parent . " I come here a lot . I don ' t know now . "
