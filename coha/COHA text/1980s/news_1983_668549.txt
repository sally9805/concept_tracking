Mary McGoon has retired to Putney , Vt. , to perfect her recipe for frozen ginger ale salad . The members of the " Mary Backstayge , Noble Wife " troupe , America ' s Favorite Family of the Footlights , have given up show biz ( only temporarily , one hopes ) and are back in Skunk Haven , Long Island , mismanaging their restaurant , the House of Toast . Bert and Harry Piel were , at last report , hiding out somewhere in South America , for reasons that remain a mystery . But the indefatigable Wally Ballou goes on and on , and so do Bob and Ray . The Two and Only aren ' t hanging by their thumbs . They ' ve got work , writing and ruminating as usual in the Greybar Building in midtown Manhattan , in a deceptively tiny office that is home to the ever-expanding roster of players and personnel of Goulding-Elliot - Greybar Productions Inc. , sole makers of Bob and Ray stuff ( the company motto : " Puissance Without Hauteur " ) . The target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyday human foolishness . Their humor is pointed , but never mean-spirited . Their two-man repertory company of fools , bores , curmudgeons , stumblers , bumblers , braggarts , eccentrics , dupes , lunatics , deluded souls and shameless self-promoters has kept their fans enthralled since 1946 , the year they began working together on WHDH radio in Boston . Bob Elliott was the morning disc jockey ; Ray Goulding did the news . They began ad-libbing on the air , poking fun at radio , mostly to amuse themselves . " Bob and myself got into it accidentally , " says Ray . " We were serious radio announcers . Well , that ' s serious with quotes around it . We had no idea we ' d ever be comedians . It never entered my mind , certainly . " " No , " says Bob , " it just kind of developed . " What developed was one of the most successful comedy teams ever . For 37 years , Bob and Ray have delighted millions on radio , on television , on Broadway , in movies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They ' ve won all sorts of awards , from the coveted Golden Prune for their brilliant work in prune promotion to three Peabody Awards for excellence in broadcasting . Currently there ' s a lot of Bob and Ray around , although it ' s safe to say there ' s never as much as their fans would like . Their new book is out , a collection of their recent work , " From Approximately Coast to Coast . . . It ' s the Bob and Ray Show . " In September , National Public Radio rebroadcast a series of half- hour Bob and Ray shows recorded and first aired last year . And in New York , the Museum of Broadcasting has been featuring a Bob and Ray retrospective , a collection of highlights from their television work of the last 30 years . The show includes , among many things , two half-hour Bob and Ray shows from 1951 , appearances with Ed Sullivan , Perry Como , Johnny Carson , Dick Cavett and David Letterman , as well as their memorable appearance as guest hosts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Museum of Broadcasting one recent Friday , a long line of people waited for admission . Some , particularly one man in a porkpie hat studded with old political buttons , looked suspiciously like characters in a Bob and Ray routine . Many were young people , so young their parents must have been toddlers when Bob and Ray first teamed up . Bob and Ray ' s appeal seems to transcend age and time . New generations keep discovering their work . " We ' ve had a lot of experiences with young people , and we always get a good reaction , " Ray says . " When we were on Saturday Night Live , ' and when we had the show on WOR , we were loaded with youngsters . " The show on WOR in New York was their last daily radio job . It ran for three years until 1976 , when the station didn ' t renew their contract . The parting was not friendly , but Bob and Ray believe it was for the best . " They were really strange about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we wanted to go out and do the Tonight ' show , they were very tough about letting us take a couple of days . " " They got in our way , " adds Ray . " It was a little awkward . " They ' re both down on commercial radio . " There ' s no station where our kind of stuff fits anymore , " Ray says . " Radio has changed a lot , " says Bob . " It ' s all news , all talk , all phone- in . " " And all boring , " says Ray . But Bob and Ray have found a part-time radio home , and a most appreciative audience , on National Public Radio . They ' re now working on material for eight more half-hour shows that will be recorded for NPR this month and broadcast later in the year . They ' re still doing commercials , for Red Devil Paint and Panasonic among other products . And they ' re promoting their book , in which Bob and Ray fans will meet some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar favorites are Martin LeSoeur , raconteur , the expansive tale-spinner who never can remember the end of his anecdotes ; Harlowe P. Whitcomb , president of the Slow Talkers of America ; and Ralph Flinger , alias Mr. I-Know-Where-They-Are , who specializes in tracking down " washed-up celebrities . " There ' s a new " Dining Out with Bob and Ray " segment , a review of the Far Rockaway House of Clam Chowder and Soda Crackers in Yonkers , and a new soap opera , " the unfolding story of intrigue among the socially prominent families of Garish Summit . There - in stately splendor far removed from the squalid village below - they fight their petty battles over power and money . " The improbable plot of " Garish Summit " involves a cast of dozens , including " the wealthy but spineless young executive " Rodney Murchfield , his dowager mother , Agatha , her long-lost elder son , Caldwell , and a mysterious figure called Big Otto from Detroit . The fact that " Garish Summit " bears some twisted resemblance to such televised supersoaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much beside the point . In The New Yorker magazine a few years ago , in a splendid profile of Bob and Ray , Whitney Balliett observed that their work has transcended the elements it parodies and achieved a life of its own . " The ingenuity and variety of old-time radio has long since been replaced by three monolithic formats - news , music and talk - so the source of much of their original material has vanished , " Balliett wrote . " But a miraculous thing has happened to their comic company ; instead of falling by the wayside , since parody generally exists only as long as its original does , it has taken on a life of its own and exists completely within itself . " Thus it ' s not necessary to know that " Mary Backstayge , Noble Wife " was based on the the old radio soap " Mary Noble , Backstage Wife " to appreciate its humor . Likewise , you need never have seen an episode of " General Hospital " to laugh at Bob and Ray ' s " General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ross Flecknoy and his struggle to save all humanity at the prescription counter of a pharmacy still technically owned by his aging father . " Bob and Ray say they don ' t have many regrets . They would have liked to have done more television and movies . And they wish they had recorded some of the material they did in their early days together . " A lot of our stuff went out once and was never heard again , " Ray says . " We ad-libbed it . There wasn ' t a script . It wasn ' t recorded . It ' s gone . Well , maybe it ' s out there somewhere , at least according to scientists . " These days Bob and Ray seem content taking life comparatively easy . There were years when their lives were extremely hectic , when they ' d do radio all morning and television into the night . " Time marches on , " Rays says . " Sometimes I think I ' d just as soon go out and hit fungoes . " Bob and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brunswick , Maine . Their five children are all grown . He paints watercolors , as he has for years , and recently had a one-man show at Bowdoin College . Ray and his wife , Mary , live on Long Island and spend a lot of time at their vacation home in Hyannis . They have six children , the youngest of whom is in college . Ray turned 60 in 1982 . This year it was Bob ' s turn . Do they think about retiring ? " Of course not , " says Ray , giving lie to any talk about hitting fungoes . " We ' re bigger than ever . "
