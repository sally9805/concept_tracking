 | Last year , after eight years with AT &T?and; a climb from strategic planner to product manager in the company 's Parsippany , N.J. , office ? Michael Halberstadt , 41 , took stock . " I realized that the corporate environment was not where I wanted to be , " he says . He moved to Los Angeles , took a position teaching business and accounting at Santa Monica College and is now preparing to launch his own financial-planning company . He expects his experience analyzing financial markets for AT &T; to provide a solid base when it comes to selecting investments for clients . Halberstadt made three smart moves : He saw the need to make a career switch and acted before stagnating personally and professionally . He leveraged skills he already had into a different set of responsibilities that give him greater satisfaction . And he picked a field ? financial services ? that should grow dramatically in coming years . Climbing into and through the ranks of middle management is probably tougher than it has ever been , what with corporate downswings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professionals are reacting by finding new employers , by making lateral shifts into new departments within their companies or by going off on their own . The number of executives who have worked for one corporation for more than 25 years declined from 31 percent to 24 percent between 1979 and 1985. according to a study by Korn-Ferry , an executive-recruiting firm , and the UCLA Graduate School of Management . At the same time , the number of executives working with their current employers for less than five years in- creased from 15 percent in 1979 to 21 percent in 1985 . Negotiating your own route to professional success , whether with one company or by moving on , calls for keeping an eye on the big picture . It 's vital to understand how competitive your firm is in its industry and what its chances are of riding out a recession . Might it be a takeover candidate ? If so , you could become a bit player , or no player at all , in the new corporate structure . Even if your firm 's future looks bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps you 're doomed to a holding pattern by the baby-boom bulge ? your superiors are only slightly older than you , and there 's no chance of promotion . Computers have already reduced the need for managers ? greater efficiency means one manager can supervise 21 people today , up from only six , according to futurist Marvin Cetron . Fewer heads , same load Ironically , downsizing can also create opportunities for career builders who stay with one company for the long run . " The head count drops during a downsizing , but the workload does n't , " says Washington , D.C. , management consultant Robert Tomasko . This allows employes to prove themselves by taking on additional responsibilities that formerly were divided among many workers . To survive and thrive in uncertain times , you 're going to have to concentrate on gaining visibility and being fast on your feet , says Robert Wegmann , professor of sociology at the University of Houston in Clear Lake and author of Looking for Work in the New Economy ( Olympus , Salt Lake City , $14.95 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example . Offer to take up some of the office slack ? preparing departmental reports or overseeing projects , for example ? when the workload in your department is high . This initiative will be especially valuable when companies are scaling back and individual workloads increase . Taking on tasks that are n't part of your job description both gains you recognition and prepares you for a possible career switch . Tomasko cites a market researcher who would rather be working in the human-resources department of his East Coast-based company , which runs fast-food chains and supermarkets . The researcher recently noticed that the human-resources department was having trouble attracting employes for fast-food jobs . He suggested that they apply market-research techniques to zero in on the wants and needs of potential employes ? in effect treating them like customers and the jobs that needed to be filled like products . He has yet to officially move over , but he 's primed . Rather than being one of hundreds of market researchers at his company , he has caught the eye of superiors and is more likely to be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to pinpoint the skills you can leverage into a different and better job ? in or out of the company you work for ? is to examine the way your current responsibilities mesh with those of business contacts . Jeffrey Allen , author of Surviving Corporate Downsizing ( John Wiley &; Sons , $12.95 ) , recommends a " reciprocal " approach to job switching , particularly for people in highly specialized fields . A contracts administrator whose job involves negotiating contracts with your mentor of your abilities , he or she will be more apt to recommend you for challenging assignments . customers , for example , could look across his desk and see a possibile career as a purchasing agent . The turf is exactly the same ; only the point of view is different . " For nearly every job , there is a flip side or reciprocal position that a person could tailor his resume to , " says Allen . You 'll probably be better equipped to hurdle obstacles to upward mobility if you cultivate a mentor , who will take a personal interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The direct approach is best , say career counselors . Choose someone you respect who knows your work and approach him or her from time to time for help in solving problems . Once you convince Three years out of law school , for instance , Joseph Byrne took a job as an assistant legal counsel for Vons Supermarkets in Los Angeles . His enthusiasm led his boss , a senior vice president , to let Byrne handle negotiations for new stores . " Those are opportunities to watch for , " Byrne advises . " Overworked top executives are glad to pass off responsibility . " He has parlayed the real-estate savvy he gained from those negotiations into the presidency of an Oakland , Calif. , property-management and real-estate-marketing company . Mentors do n't just create chances , says Byrne : " They also kept me from making any major mistakes . " Lacking an obvious mentor , you still can work where your efforts are appreciated and your position is relatively secure during tough times . Aiming your skills at a target where they 'll be needed most is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Crystal-Barkley Corporation , one of the nation 's largest career-counseling firms . Talented computer programers , for example , will probably be more valued at a software firm than in the data-processing department of a large company , where they would be support staff and individual initiative would be valued less . Moving to a new employer means  | networking ? getting the word out that you 're looking . Seminars , conferences and professional meetings can turn up endless contacts for networking : When the formal presentations end , do n't leave . That 's the time to meet the speakers and participants , and each is a thread in a network of possible job leads . They 'll be more than happy to talk with you since you 're a contact , too . The familiarity factor When you 're ready to call on employers , zero in on the one or two managers in each organization who can do you the most good . Arrange a meeting with each of them if possible ? and attend professional conferences where you 'll be in a position to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll find it much easier to promote your experience to them in an informal setting , and when it comes time to make a job proposal , you wo n't be a stranger . If a spot opens up , the qualified candidate a harried manager already knows will have a big edge on the competition . You can find plenty of help , for a price . Career counselors can tune up your resume writing and interview savvy , analyze your skills and personality and otherwise aid in sculpting a new career . Fees range from between $25 and $75 an hour for private sessions to thousands of dollars for lengthy workshops . CrystalBarkley in New York , for example , charges anywhere from $1,500 to $4,000 for five days of intensive group sessions and up to six months of individual consultations . Many companies that cut back their work force hire these firms to help retrain and relocate employes . But before signing on with a counselor , a bit of scrutiny is in order . Twenty-five states require counselors to have a general-counseling license before they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and licensing . A license , of course , does n't guarantee results . In fact , many successful and respected counseling firms operate in states that do n't require licensing . Checking with references and the local Better Business Bureau for complaints that may have been filed against the counselor is a logical precaution . A counselor who claims that all of his clients move into higher-paying jobs , or who asks for the full fee up front , warrants suspicion . So does a counselor who has " secret " methods of career building that are n't generally used by others in the field ? or who promises to do all the job hunting for you . Counselors give advice . You 'll be doing all the hard work . Headhunters ' prey Career counselors should n't be confused with recruiters . Most of the time , headhunters are hired by companies looking for employes . Companies pay recruiters a fee ranging from a third to a full year 's salary for the position they 're trying to fill . It wo n't cost anything to contact a recruiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should n't waste your time unless you 're on the top rungs of your organization . They usually concentrate on managers and executive officers in the $75,000-and-up salary range . For the stout of heart , the best way to jump start a stalled career may be to strike off alone . But it 's not a route to be traveled on whim . The economy is now in its sixth year of expansion , and what goes up eventually comes down . In 1987 , 61,209 businesses , about half of which had been in business less than five years , went under . That was 15 percent fewer than the year before , but the number of business failures rose sharply in the 1981-82 recession , and another economic lull invariably will send the failure rate rising again . Furthermore , turning an entrepreneurial dream into reality takes cash , and a lot of it . According to a 1987 study done for the National Federation of Independent Business in Washington , D.C. , the average new business uses $20,000 to get under way ? before unforeseen expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ownermanaged businesses with Spicer &; Oppenheim in New York , figures that you 'll need at least $100,000 in ready capital to buy a going concern that will net about $35,000 the first year . Even if you 're sure you 'll be the next Steve Jobs , rushing headlong into a venture without a meticulous business plan is surely suicidal . Especially with the possibility of recession looming , the business you 're thinking of needs to be researched carefully to make sure the market for your idea is sound . For example , William Dunkelberg , dean of the School of Business and Management at Temple University , advises hesitating before going into a business that services defense contractors . As defense expenditures soften , contractors may suffer . To up the odds that your business will survive infancy , use your own business experience to carve out a specialized  | niche . If you know the beverage industry inside out , for example , you also probably know which aspects of the business are the thirstiest for supplies or services . Staying in an area you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security of a large organization for your new roles as chief executive officer , bookkeeper and janitor . For all the personal anxiety that 's part of starting a small business , the expanding service economy will create opportunities in everything from travel to legal services . Kevin and Rosa Lee Jones of Fulton , Miss. , for instance , have carved a profitable niche by providing muchneeded trade information to growing regional industries without established networks . Their two trade journals , Catfish News and Aquaculture News , are aimed at the growing farm-raised-catfish industry and the commercial-seafood industry , respectively . Supplying or servicing the paper or chemical industries , perhaps by providing office cleaning or computer-service contracts , might also be a wise choice , says Dunkelberg . Even if the economy sags , the weak dollar should buoy export potential and keep these industries afloat . You do n't have to market yourself directly to paper or chemical companies to benefit ? even opening a barber shop in a paper-mill town lets you tie your income to a strong local industry . Watching for trends You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trends . Michael Gonzales opened his minority employment agency and executive-search firm in Dallas , Tex. , four years ago just the right moment , it turns out , since Bureau of Labor Statistics projections show minorities growing to as much as 26 percent of the work force by the year 2000 . And services targeted to the aged , of course , will hardly lack for customers . A franchise is one easy way to get into a growth area . These insta-businesses offer a tested strategy as well as advice and support from the parent firm . But it 'll hardly be a soft ride on the back of a paternal sponsor . A franchise buys you a brand name , but you have to supply the customers . Still , fewer than 4 percent of franchises are discontinued annually , and Dennis Neier points out that franchises that are convenience-oriented are n't hurt as much by economic downturns . Starting up a maintenance-andcleaning service calls for a median cash investment of $10,000 , a convenience store $40,000 and a restaurant $75,000 .

By learning to monitor the effects of changes in his insulin intake and diet , he tamed his diabetes ? and was inspired to become a doctor . At 45 , he says , " I was the oldest medical freshman in the country . " But now Richard Bernstein , M.D. , specializes in helping other diabetics control the disease . The powerful economic and demographic crosswinds that will affect the career courses of millions of Americans in the years to come are obviously beyond anyone 's control . But you can gain a measure of control over your own career . You 'll have to take risks to do so . but at least that will be your choice , not the economy's.
