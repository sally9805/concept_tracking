Reagan 's plan for arms reduction gets a mixed reaction <P> " Reaching agreement with the Soviets will not be short or easy work . But I believe that the Soviet people and their leaders understand the importance of preventing war . And I believe that a firm , forthright American position on arms reduction can bring us closer to a settlement . " <P> With words that conveyed both firmness and flexibility , Ronald Reagan last week began the campaign for his plan to reduce the nuclear arsenals of the world 's two superpowers . In a prime-time press conference , he elaborated on and defended his proposal , outlined the previous Sunday at Illinois ' Eureka College , for Strategic Arms Reduction Talks ( START ) . Reagan 's plan would require deep reductions in the Soviets ' large land-based missiles , which form the bulk of their arsenal . " I think you start with first things first , " the President said , referring to the massive rockets that he calls the most " destabilizing " of all arms systems . But he also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. long-range missiles and to discuss weapons in which the U.S. has an edge , chiefly cruise missiles and manned bombers . Said Reagan : " Nothing is excluded . " <P> The President 's desire to appear both resolute and open-minded on arms negotiations reflects the divergent concerns of the three audiences- in the U.S. , Western Europe and the Kremlin-to which his message was addressed . Despite their differences , those listeners appeared to share one basic and important reaction : relief that the Administration , after 16 months of delay and internal dissent , had come forth with a plan to get the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. back to the strategic arms bargaining table . The only group that expressed dismay at the President 's intentions were some hard-line U.S. conservatives , who feel betrayed by Reagan 's more moderate approach . <P> There was , however , criticism of the specifics of the President 's plan from some advocates of arms control who claimed that it would be patently unacceptable to the Soviets . To reach Reagan 's target of only 2,500 land-based warheads for each nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . At the same time , the U.S. would be allowed to add 350 . Although each side now has roughly 7,000 strategic warheads , the Soviets put more than twice as many of theirs on big land-based missiles . In turn , the U.S. would have to dismantle almost 2,500 submarine-based warheads , while the Soviets could add to their fleet . Reagan 's speech , with its stated focus on land-based warheads , put some Americans in the awkward position of doubting the sincerity of their own leader . Said former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie : " What troubles me about the program is that it may be a secret agenda for sidetracking disarmament . "
