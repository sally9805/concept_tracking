FISHING A Harpoon for Japan 's Whalers <P> Under pressure from the U.S. , Japan agreed last November to put its sperm whalers , among the last practitioners of an ancient profession , out of business by 1988 . American conservationists , who consider whaling a senseless slaughter of an endangered species , were not satisfied . Greenpeace and eleven other environmental groups sued the U.S. Government , charging that amendments to two separate conservation laws require in effect that the Administration impose economic sanctions on Japan for its whaling operations . <P> Last week a U.S. Court of Appeals , ruling in favor of the conservationists , decreed that within 90 days the Government must order Japan to reduce its catch of fish in American waters by 50% . That would be a serious economic blow to the Japanese , who took in roughly two-thirds of the 1.4 million metric tons of fish caught by foreigners off U.S. shores last year . The Administration , not eager to rock its relations with Japan , may ask the Court of Appeals for a rehearing of the case and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The outcome will determine when Japan 's whalers will have to hang up their harpoon guns.STOCK TRADING An Insider Faces Jail <P> The penalty was a stern warning to financial journalists who may be tempted to trade on inside information . In a Manhattan courtroom , Federal Judge Charles Stewart last week sentenced J. Foster Winans , 37 , a former Wall Street Journal reporter who had been convicted of 59 counts of fraud and conspiracy , to a $5,000 fine , 18 months in prison and five years on probation . <P> Winans was found guilty of leaking advance information from his influential " Heard on the Street " column during 1983 and 1984 to two Kidder , Peabody stockbrokers , Peter Brant and Kenneth Felis . They used the knowledge to make trades that earned them $675,000 . Of that amount , Winans and his roommate David Carpenter , 36 , received $31,000 . <P> Winans , who plans to appeal , volunteered to do his time working in programs for victims of AIDS . Judge Stewart denied the request . Before the sentence was passed , Assistant U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outline for a book titled Trading Secrets : Fear , Power and Greed on Wall Street . Winans said it would dissuade others from resorting to " unethical or immoral behavior . " MORTGAGES Fannie Mae Gets Tough <P> For many young couples , the dream of owning their own homes became more distant last week . Reason : the Federal National Mortgage Association , known as Fannie Mae , tightened its mortgage-eligibility standards . Borrowers who put up less than 10% of the purchase price on a home must now have higher incomes . Under old Fannie Mae rules , for example , a buyer making $36,814 could purchase a $76,500 home by putting down 5% and getting a $72,700 loan at 12.2% interest . Now that same borrower would need an income of $41,232 . <P> Rather than lend directly to consumers , Fannie Mae buys mortgages from banks and savings and loan associations , providing them with money to make additional loans . Most lenders stay in line with Fannie Mae 's rules so they can sell mortgages to the agency .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
