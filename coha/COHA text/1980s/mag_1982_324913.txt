Prices are up , but so is consumption in the fizz biz <P> From time immemorial , champagne has been the ambrosia of New Year 's and nuptials , ship launchings and seductions . In recent years , all this has changed . Champagne has become a drink for all occasions and is now quaffed in such Jeroboam quantities that the fizz biz poppeth over . The thirst for authentic French bubbly , plus the grievous crop damage to French vines in three of the past four years , has raised prices for the real stuff* and has forced French shippers to ration the choice vintages . At Manhattan 's elegant Four Seasons restaurant , for instance , a bottle of Henriot Reserve Phillippe de Rothschild 1975 now costs $110 . Five years ago , a comparable bottle sold for about $60 . At Jacqueline 's Champagne &; Wine Bar in Manhattan , a fluted glass of champagne costs $5.50 . Some bars also serve pricey champagne cocktails , such as Kir Royal ( with cassis ) and Mimosa ( with orange juice ) . <P> Americans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine . Given the large acreage suitable for chardonnay and the other grapes used for bubbly and no legal prohibitions against calling their product champagne , U.S. wine makers , mostly in California , have for many years been producing sparkling wines that compare well with some of the good French vintages ; some are made by the French methode champenoise . Last October , for example , Sonoma County 's venerable F. Korbel &; Bros , introduced a dry , delicate , straw-colored Blanc de Blancs that drew critical raves at blind tastings . It costs around $16-no steal , but less than the price of a comparable imported bottle . <P> California wine makers shipped some 22 million gal . of bubbly in 1980 , up a cork-busting 52% over the 1970 level . French champagne makers in 1981 shipped to the U.S. more than twice as much as in 1971 . The lesson was not lost on the French . Mot-Hennessy , a Paris-based conglomerate that is France 's biggest champagne exporter to the U.S. , bought 1,500 Napa Valley acres in 1973 .

The company , whose bubbly retails for about $12 a bottle ( vs. around $24 for imported Mot &; Chandon ) , plans to produce 5 million bottles annually . By comparison , its parent , Mot-Hennessy , shipped 2.6 million bottles to the U.S. in 1981 . Another French firm , Piper-Heid-sieck , has started a California winery with Sonoma Vineyards and will release its first wines in late 1982 . <P> To some oenophiles , champagne seems a frivolous drink , a pleasant apritif but unsuitable for consumption throughout a meal . Says Humorist Art Buchwald : " It tastes as though my foot 's asleep . " Yet , inevitably , the noble , pale gold fluid , its nose-wrinkling bubbles and the sense of care and occasion that accompanies it will always make the wine more of a celebration than a tipple . As they say in the Napa Valley these days , Sant !
