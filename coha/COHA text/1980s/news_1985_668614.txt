Iacocca ' s reward program is billed " Thank You , America " and includes mailing " thank you " notes and $500 certificates to the 4. 4 million people who bought new Chrysler cars or trucks between 1979-1984 . Those people may use the certificate toward the purchase or lease of an 1985 Chrysler vehicle . The program also includes paying a one-time $500 cash bonus to 60 , 000 Chrysler employees who are members of the United Auto Worker union and the same bonus plus a $500 certificate to all salaried workers not on the bonus rolls . In addition , the company is setting aside $135 million for distribution as executives bonuses for 1984 .

For the year , earnings more than tripled to $2. 38 billion , or $18. 88 a share , from the previous record of $700. 9 million , or $5. 79 a share , set in 1983 . Sales for the year rose to $19. 5 billion from $13. 2 billion . The 1984 profit included tax credits totaling $883. 9 million , more than double credits of $399 million in 1983 . Credits were exhausted last year , and Chrysler , for the first time since 1977 , paid taxes , which totaled $50 million . Iacocca ' s mailing to vehicle owners said : " This is to express my personal thanks for the faith you had in Chrysler products at a time when that faith was just about all that kept us in business . " Chrysler lost $1. 09 billion in 1979 , $1. 7 billion in 1980 and $476 million in 1981 before earning $170 million in 1982 and $700. 9 million in 1983 . David Healy , analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chrysler has an 85-day supply of subcompacts at its dealerships ( 60 days is normal ) and a 145-day supply of unsold sports cars . The $500 is a rebate and won ' t really cost them much , because for every car they sell their profit goes up about $2 , 000 , " he said . Scott Merlis , analyst with Shearson/American Express in New York , said the UAW bonus was significant . " It represents a conciliatory gesture before the opening of new contract negotiations in July . Chrysler is saying ' you shared in the difficult times , now you ' ll share the riches , ' " he said , adding that it also is a reminder about sharing in any difficult times again . However , UAW President Owen Bieber issued a statement saying the one-time special bonus , " doesn ' t substitute for steps that must be taken to bring Chrysler workers back on track with their sisters and brothers at GM and Ford . " Iacocca said the $135 million set aside for executive bonuses is two- thirds the maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Individual bonuses weren ' t announced , but the total will be less than $135 million , he said . Merlis said there was no mention of rewarding shareholders for the record profits . " They already got theirs in the form of the resumption of dividends last year and Chrysler ' s December announcement it will buy back 25 million shares of its own outstanding stock " to ward off dilution , he said .
