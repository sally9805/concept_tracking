When the temperature hit the 90s on Labor Day afternoon , most of the 200 people at a three-day reunion of 1960s Ann Arbor activists had left Camp Tamarack in Orton-vine , Michigan , and headed back to their widely scattered homes Four heat-weary stragglers  --  three women and the 4-year-old son of one of them  --  stood in front of a camp cabin and weighed the pros and cons of one more swim , even though the lifeguard had gone off duty . Tequila Minsky , a New York photographer and professional party-giver , settled the discussion by declaring , " We 've never followed the rules  --  why should we now ? " There is a clich ? about 1960s activists : that they opted for the rules , sold out , took upwardly mobile jobs , bought pricey foreign cars and feel guilty about the gap between their past and present lives . One major frame around this picture is The Big Chill , the movie written and directed by Larry Kasdan , a 1970 graduate of the University of Michigan . In 1960s Ann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while thousands of other students , teachers and " outside agitators " pursued their avenues of politics in a community that throbbed with activism of all stripes . None of these people forgot their education . Kasdan went on to make Hollywood movies based largely on the hundreds of movies he watched in college . Maybe Kasdan and his friends traded in their ideals for their careers and fat bank accounts , but most of the Michigan graduates I know have bitterly criticized Kasdan for popularizing this image . The Labor Day reunion revealed that the activists have not abandoned their politics ; the depth and diversity of their continuing political commitment came as an exalting surprise . Ann Arbor in the 1960s was the home of the first draft board sit-in , the first anti-Vietnam War teach-in and the birthplace of Students for a Democratic Society ; along with Columbia University and the University of California , Berkeley , the University of Michigan was the campus that most embodied the social-political movements of the decade . Those days of mass and often confrontational politics Ellen Perley Frank is a writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but at the reunion it was evident that many veteran activists have adapted their politics to a more sedate life and the needs of their own communities . On the second afternoon of the reunion , a committee of five veteran activists sat cross-legged at the end of a dock and worked up a page-and-a-half-long statement for the whole group . It affirms : " We have come to understand that attaining the goals of a just , peaceful , equitable and ecologically sound society requires a lifetime of commitment . " It also lists a number of ongoing causes , beginning with " the growing menace of the nuclear arms race " and ending with " the callous disregard of the plight of our elders . " The document was accepted with whoops , cheers , applause and nary a nay after a dinner of kosher fried chicken and egg noodles . ( Camp Tamarack is a Jewish environmental camp , with totem poles in its dining room doorway carved with faces representing the twelve tribes of Israel . ) Have times changed ? Richard Levy , who teaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " the committee was asked not to mention a laundry list of causes . . . In 1968 you could n't have gotten a group of political people to agree even on punctuation , and here they did what we asked them not to do , and it was accepted unanimously . " The group 's political diversity was documented in columns where people wrote their " Current Affiliation " when they signed the statement . This long affiliation roster includes : " Saskatchewan Coalition Against Cutbacks , " " Rockford , Illinois , Peace and Justice Action , " " Physicians for Social Responsibility and medical director , Jackson and Livingston Michigan Counties , " " historian and agitator , " " Gay Community News , Resist , Mobilization for Survival , " " Ann Arbor City Council , " " Psychologist , work with peace and women 's issues , " " auto worker/ Detroiters for Dignity , " " theater worker , " " Marxist historian , " " peace research ? Cambridge , Mass. , " " M.D. , San Francisco County Jail , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and past president , National Lawyers Guild , " and on and on and on . You might notice one trend in these identifications . These are highly skilled and educated people , including many lawyers , doctors , artists and Ph.D.s who once marched on the Pentagon and now channel their politics into their work . Others have stuck with the 1960s call of working-class politics : Richard Feldman , one of the reunion organizers , has worked in a Ford truck plant for seventeen years and recently completed and found a publisher for an oral history of thirty auto workers . Frank Hammer , president of a United Auto Workers local , said , " When I told the people that I work with that I was coming to this reunion , one of them said , ' What we need is a little bit of the sixties in the eighties . ' We are not only part of that history but in our own separate ways have continued that history . " The political scope has scaled down since then . " I remember people seriously telling me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year or two , ' " recalled Eric Chester , a former S.D S. leader who now teaches economics at the University of Massachusetts , Boston , and who proved at the reunion to be a whiz at child care " I have not lost the values I acquired in the sixties . I have learned that the appropriate size of my sphere of influence is a lot smaller than the one I and we tried to work in during the sixties and seventies . Within this sphere , I do my best . " That is what Cendra Lynn , a psychologist who specializes in grief and loss , wrote in the reunion 's " yearbook " ? a word processor that took in many reflections and autobiographies during the course of three days . The kids loved the machine . Joseph Hammer , age 10 , wrote , " See ya later CAMPERS . " And Joyce Kornbluh , a historian and twenty-seven-year veteran of the University of Michigan 's Labor Studies Center , wrote , " I am planning to continue the struggle to the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and radicalize the angels . " Countless historians , journalists , sociologists , anthropologists and filmmakers , as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other police agencies , have all done their own interpretation of the 1960s . But at The Real Big Chill we discovered that that rebellious era is far bigger than any single story . Most of us came to this reunion thinking that the 1960s in Ann Arbor were Our 1960s and that we 'd know almost everyone there . Wrong . Veterans of S.D.S. , many of whom had n't seen one another for fifteen years , might have accounted for forty of the 200 people . " And there were as many kids  --  forty-eight  --  as there once would have been dogs , " said Chicago neonatal specialist Dan Sobel , who did bring his dog . I was expecting to see many old friends who had been active in the avant-garde arts , the Ann Arbor Film Festival or writers from The Michigan Daily or the Ann Arbor Sun , a biweekly alternative newspaper . But very few representatives from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reunion . Most of the people there had vaguely familiar faces and , oddly ( except for the trimmed or vanished beards and the shorter and graying hair ) , they all looked as they did Back Then . Was this an illusion created by the bathing-suit-and-shorts informality of the Camp Tamarack setting ? Or does my memory allow people to age at the same rate I do ? The combination of people at the reunion made for some strange bedfellows . After their first night in a cabin with a couple from Detroit who were members of the Revolutionary Communist Party , California artists Judy Ehrlich and Nick Bertoni sleepily grumbled that they 'd been kept up most of the night by their bunkmates ' boisterous show-and-tell trip down memory lane with photographs of arrests at various 1960s demonstrations . At the " Memorial for Fallen Comrades " on Sunday night , the R.C.P. man stood up and said , " I 'd like to remember Chairman Mao Zedong , who died in his last great struggle  --  trying to defend China against the re-establishment of capitalism . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'd like to remember John Belushi , who died under mysterious circumstances . The media thinks so too . I miss him a lot . " At that memorial I waited and waited for someone to speak in memory of the one person many of us had known who had died in a violent and mistaken political act : Diana Oughton , one of three Weathermen killed in unexpected self-immolation when a bomb went off in 1970 in a New York City townhouse . Finally , I stood up and spoke of her work as a teacher at the long-gone Children 's Community School in Ann Arbor . The ice was broken . Michael Zweig , then an S.D.S. leader , now a professor of economics at the State University of New York , Stony Brook , spoke in memory of Ted Gold and Terry Robbins , who were also killed in that explosion . The splits in S.D.S. , then the violence and fugitive years of the Weathermen , were much-avoided topics at this reunion . There was no desire to root out bad memories and old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education at the University of Illinois , Chicago Circle ) and Bernardine Dohrn ( she works for a Chicago law firm ) were at the reunion with their children , but they stayed at the beach during the four workshops and left before the memorial . I canoed for hours with Bernardine and Chesa ( son of the imprisoned Kathy Boudin and Dave Gilbert ) . She spoke with frustration about the seven hearings she 's had before the New York Bar Association 's Ethics Committee , which still will not admit her to the bar . She said that maybe she 'll try in Illinois . The lifeguard yelled repeatedly through a bullhorn to stay in sight of the dock . I complained . Chesa asked , " What 's wrong with the lifeguard saying that ? " Bernardine answered , " She 's anti-authority . She wants her privacy . She wants to be left alone . " Was she talking about me or about herself ? On Sunday morning about a hundred people crowded into a Camp Tamarack meeting room for a workshop titled " Telling It Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sixties ? " Bret Eynon , who has set up an oral history project that interviewed 175 Ann Arbor 1960s activists , led off . Eynon 's fifteen-minute package history began with pickets in front of the Ann Arbor F.W. Woolworth in 1960 , a solidarity action for the lunchroom desegregation pickets in the South . The long but fast list of events included many sit-ins , both small ( thirty-nine arrests at the Ann Arbor draft board in 1965 ) and large ( 240 at the County Building in a 1968 solidarity action with welfare mothers ) . Eynon mentioned the initial and later divisions within S.D.S. , the spread of women 's groups , anti-Reserve Officer Training Corps confrontations with the police , three days of street riots in 1969 , teach-ins against the war in Vietnam , and then he swept into the 1970s with the Indochina Peace Campaign , the emergence of John Sinclair 's White Panther Party and the inroads into Ann Arbor city government ( two City Council seats ) through the Human Rights Party . " Overviews are all right for making you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of the Massachusetts Adult Literacy Program . From all around the room people filled in the many blanks in Eynon 's minihistory . One particularly vivid memory was the 1968 football game when 100,000 people watched a surprise halftime show  --  an antiwar demonstration . The people in the room gave contextual life to a list of events that sounded remotely abstract in the retelling . Eric Chester said , " When we talk about the sixties we might find a unity that was n't there . There were n't just personality differences but major underlying political questions . In 1964 Ann Arbor S.D.S. was in strong disagreement with the national organization . Their slogan was ' Part of the way with L.B.J. ' That was not a trivial disagreement . " From across the room someone added , " We presented ourselves as revolutionaries , and there was no revolution . A lot of people now say , ' So what ? ' But we lived in a very special time . We picked up the world and moved it someplace . The sense of possibility , the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And another man added , " We ended a war and brought down a President . If we did that then , we could do much more now . " Could we ? Like the people in Larry Kasdan 's movie , we 've shivered through our own Big Chill  --  but it is the loss of a large supportive community rather than the loss of politics or ideals . Adulthood took its toll and we dispersed , followed our talents , sharpened our specialties , had children . " We 've paid our dues through separation . What was important was the community , that extended family , " said Alan Haber , then an S.D.S. leader , now a Berkeley , California , cabinetmaker and organizer of a warehouse building for community groups . Few of the people at the reunion seemed adrift without that anchor of community . Yes , there was an occasional voice of despair , such as the man who said in a workshop , " One of the reasons why I came here is because most of the important things in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know how to carry it on . " But Julia Wrigley , who teaches the sociology of education at the University of California , Los Angeles , seemed to speak for the reunion group as a whole when she said , " Ann Arbor in the sixties was a transformative period for all of us . We learned how to deal with authority on many levels We learned how to speak up . There 's no going back . Once you become assertive you do n't just give it up . " ? .
