Aiding nature <P> " In all the encounters , it was obvious that the male and female were excited and sexually interested in each other . She was willing and he was anxious , but they just couldn ' t coordinate their efforts . " <P> <P> No , this is not an excerpt from the latest report on human sexual inadequacy by Masters and Johnson . It is the director of Washington 's National Zoo , Theodore Reed , explaining why the capital 's popular pair from Peking , the giant pandas Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing , have failed to produce offspring in three years of bumbling attempts . <P> Last week the zoo took matters into its own hands . Her bleating and scent marking tipped off officials that the female Ling-Ling was in heat , an event that lasts a scant five days each spring . So a team of 13 , including Head Veterinarian Mitchell Bush and Anesthesiologist Michael Abramowitz of the Washington , D.C. , Children 's Hospital , gathered around the lady . Ling-Ling was anesthetized , then inseminated with approximately 3.2 cc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frozen . ( Fresh semen had been collected from Hsing-Hsing shortly before the insemination , but the sperm count was considered too low for conception . ) To improve the odds that the artificial union would work , the team inseminated Ling-Ling again 24 hours later . <P> The gestation period for pandas is about five months , and it will take almost 4 months for the first signs of pregnancy to appear-a swelling of Ling-Ling 's breasts as she gets ready to nurse . Thus far only the Chinese have successfully bred a panda by artificial means . But such human intervention is becoming increasingly prudent . In the past five years , earthquakes and the natural disappearance of their major food , the arrow bamboo , have killed at least a tenth of China 's giant pandas . Today only about 1,000 remain in the wild .
