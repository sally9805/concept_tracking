txt IT IS A JUGGLING acOSorting out the apples that are best for eating and thqse than can take a little heat calls for some dexterity , especially when there are apples suited to both purposes . Knowing that the best pies and sauce are made from a variety of apples , rather than just one kind , is incentive enough to get to the core of the subject . The task is much easier than in our great-grandparents ' time . The selection of apples has narrowed from about 1,000 American varieties identified in 1872 to about 100 varieties today . Of those 100. 14 of them account for 90 per cent of commercial production . Even these top 14 are not always available in Chicago markets , because ? some of them are regional specialties . Other varieties do not have a big enough following to make mass production worthwhile , and some simply are not good shippers . Some cooks nostalgically mourn the passing of early American varieties , recalled with fondness for their flavor . ? But those apples that have survived the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ APPLES HAVE BEEN grown in America since Colonial times , and the first orchard was planted in Massachusetts in 1625 on Boston 's Beacon Hill . The fruit was important for its juice , according to Peter Wynne , author of " Apples , History , Folklore , Horticulture , and Gastronomy , " ( Hawthorn , $12.50 ) . The Colonists ferment , ed apple juice into hard cider and drank it id-stead of water , for fear water would cause diseases that had been associated with it in Europe . Apple cider also was converted Into cider vinegar to preserve fruits and vegetables for winter use . Those first apples were grown ' from seeds imported from Europe , and because the fruit was used chiefly for cider little effort was made to cultivate or improve varieties until the 18th Century . But new varieties did spring up on their own because of the nature of the apple tree . When an apple is produced from seed , it will never be exactly the same as the parent fruit . A ' seed , for example , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To control the variety , a seedling tree must be grafted with a bud from the desired variety of apple tree . Some of those early varieties , produced from seed and considered , native American apples , are the Roxbury Russet , Rhode Island Greening , and Newtown Pippin . ? Old fashioned apples make a comeback . See page 2 . IN THE 20TH CENTURY , the growth of cities and suburbs forced apple growers further and further from their markets , according to Wynne , and mfr. rowed the number of apple varieties cultivated . Fruit growers began to concentrate on varieties that were the most prolific and could withstand shipment . Limited land availability may bring more change to apple growers in the future , Wynne predicts . Apple orchards of the future may be made up of ? hedgerows of dwarf apple trees that save land space but produce plenty of fruit . The Roxbury Russet is one variety that did not survive 20th Century urbanization . The apple originated in colonial America and traveled to the Midwest and the Napa Valley of California . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities . But its . mottled , rough , leathery skin was not as pretty as bright-skinned apples , and the russet did not make the grade commercially . The survivors , with few exceptions , have a sweet taste and the reddest of skins . Down through the apple-eating ages , people have associated green apples with sourness , tartness , or a stomach ache . THE FIVE TOP-SELLING varieties in the Chicago area are Red and Golden ' Delicious , Jonathan , , and Rome Beauty apples , according to Max Parsley , produce director for Stop &; Shop . ' Supplies come from Washington state , Michigan , Wisconsin , North Clemlina , Idaho , Missouri , New ' York , and Oregon . But other varieties crap up throughout the year . " Michigan Lodi apples that ripen in mid-August signal the beginning of the season , " says Parsky . Paulared apples , also from Michigan . are late summer apples that are picked before the top sellers . Greening apples arrive in October and Winesaps in December . May is the month for bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Zealand during the summer . Short-season specialties include tart Strawberry apples from Michigan , available after Labor Day , and Lady or Love apples , miniatures that are marketed just for the holidays , , Orchards in Illinois , Wisconsin , Michigan , and Indiana grow the most popular apples , such as Delicious and Jona ( hens , but some also have specialties , such as the Ida Red , Grimes Golden , Cortland , Northern Spy , and Baldwin apples . APPLE GROWERS , who have a variety of apples available for the picking , often practice the theory that the best sauce , cider , or pie is made with a ? blend of apples . Using two or more , rather than one , varieties , produce a better blend of flavors , the experts say . One apple might bring sweetness to the union , another tartness , while a third variety contributes fragrance . To select apples , choose those that are firm , free of bruises , and heavy for their size . Occasionally , an apple may have small patches of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be confused with bruising . The patches , do not affect the eating quality of the fruit . Bruises , however , can cause de ? cay and spoilage . Small and medium apples are a more practical size for everyday use . They tend to keep better than the large glam- ? orous apples . Large quantity purchases are usually more economical if you have a place to store apples . Fresh apples will keep in the refrigerator up to three-weeks . Put them in polyethylene bags to help retain moisture and prevent transfer of food odors . Sort the apples occasionally , looking for bruised or spoiled ones . A cool cellai ? or garage , with temperatures between 32 and 40 degrees . Fahrenheit , also can be used for storage . Line the container with polyethylene to prevent moisture loss or cover the box with a moist towel . Apples will be injured if frozen , so if temperatures ' are likely to drop below freezing one night , protect the fruit by covering it with a blanket , corrugated box , or other insulating material . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( generally marketed from January to . June ) do not keep at home as long as fresh-picked apples . Controlled atmosphere apples are stored immediately after picking in sealed airtight rooms with controlled temperature and carbon dioxide to prolong their life . Another way to store apples is to make up quantities of applesauce , apple butter , or apple pies . This old-fashioned applesauce recipe , using a variety of apples , may be stored In the freezer . After cooking and quick-cooling over ice water , pack in freezer cartons or bags , allowing room at the top for expansion .
