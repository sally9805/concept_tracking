 | Sweeping high across the Atlantic Ocean at 40,000 feet or bumping across a potatofield landing strip in the Andes , airliners made in the U.S.A. have dominated the skies since the earliest days of world commercial aviation . As American aircraft manufacturers have been discovering lately , however , what goes up can come down very quickly . In the past six months , Airbus Industrie , a four-nation consortium of French , German , British and Spanish aerospace firms , has landed major orders worth as much as $7 billion from U.S. airlines . In October , Northwest ordered up to 100 twin-engine jets available in 1990 . In March , Airbus agreed to supply American Airlines with 25 short-range wide bodies for its Caribbean routes . Just last month , Northwest became Airbus 's first U.S. customer for its new generation of mediurn and long-range jumbo jets . So successful has been the Airbus challenge that since 1985 the consortium has doubled its share of major jet sales to nearly 25 percent . Pride on the line For both the U.S. and Europe , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exporter of manufactured goods , the U.S. aerospace industry recorded a $13 billion trade surplus in 1985 . In targeting America 's cushy near monopoly , Europe put both its pride and prestige ? and about $15 billion ? on the line . Charges of unfair government subsidies and threats of economic sanctions are now flying back and forth across the Atlantic . " It 's a nasty , serious challenge , and it 's going to get nastier , " says First Boston aerospace analyst Wolfgang Demisch . Plane makers estimate the market for new commercial aircraft at a quartertrillion dollars by the year 2000 . Sales will be paced , they say , by the aging of today 's workhorse fleets and the fact that global demand for air travel is rising at a steady annual rate of 5 percent . With airport congestion sure to increase , Morten Beyer of Avmark , a Virginia aviation consulting firm , says wide-body jets with big passenger volumes will be in great demand . That 's a lovely melody to Airbus officials ' ears . They hope to grab a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,000 planes , at about $75 million each . Airbus 's success is partly the result of shrewd planning . Beginning in 1980 , the consortium carefully targeted two market niches not occupied by Boeing , the top U.S. aircraft maker . The first is the market for junior-jumbo jets with the same flying range as Boeing 747s , about 8,000 statute miles , but at 300 seats , only two thirds the seating capacity of the Boeing plane . A second , even larger niche is for short-range , 150-passenger jets to replace the aging Boeing 727s and 737s and McDonnell Douglas DC-9s.  | The four-engine Airbus A340 , scheduled for delivery in 1992 , and the tri-jet McDonnell Douglas MD-11 , available in 1990 , are competing head to head for the junior-jumbo market . The new aircraft wo n't carry as many passengers as the Boeing 747 , inset , but will have as long a range ? up to 8,500 statute miles . McDonnell Douglas chose to fill these niches with existing aircraft , using a modified DC-9 for the short-range market , and pitting the MD-11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Boeing has turned its back on the latter market , saying that it sees no more than 400 orders for junior jumbos worldwide . That 's " good for one guy , not three , " declares company official Philip Condit . For short-range aircraft , Boeing is pinning its hopes on the 7J7 , which is based on a new prop-fan technology to achieve fuel savings of 30 to 40 percent . But fuel economy does n't excite buyers when jet fuel costs 55 cents a gallon . Airbus has 134 orders for its jumbos planned for 1992 and a remarkable 437 orders for its short-range , fuel-efficient A320 , due out next year . Even so , Boeing remains the world 's largest airplane maker , with a record $19 billion in sales in 1986 , compared with about $6.5 billion for Airbus and $3.5 billion for McDonnell Douglas . American sour grapes ? U.S. firms attribute much of the consortium 's success to risky deals and lowball prices underwritten by government subsidies . For example , Airbus recently agreed to provide American Airlines 25 aircraft under leases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Losing this order wo n't sink them , because they 're backed by four governments , " says analyst Paul Nisbet of PruBache . But retorts Alan Boyd , chairman of Airbus Industrie of North America , " No one sells at the catalog price . We 're all in the trenches together . " The cries of unfair competition have sparked a bitter transatlantic trade dispute . U.S. trade officials toured consortium nations ' capitals in February to press concerns over subsidies . After a chilly reception , the U.S. backed down on threats of retaliation . But the issue is still simmering . " We see this as an attempt to eliminate our new planes and put us out of business , " says Boyd . " The Europeans are not going to take this quietly . Their dander is up . " If Airbus is undercutting the competition , other U.S. aerospace firms are n't complaining . Engine makers General Electric and Pratt &; Whitney and computer and navigation-systems makers such as Bendix , Honeywell and Litton supply a third of Airbus components . Airbus is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not nailed down for the jumbos . Britain offered only half the $1.2 billion in development funds requested by British Aerospace , which has threatened to pull out . The German government is unhappy with the rising costs of Airbus programs and the dim prospects for a return on its investment . Airbus Chairman Jean Pierson promises Airbus will be in the black by 1995 . " The jumbos are the last of our strategic products , " says Stuart Iddles , senior vice president of Airbus . " We will not need more funds . " But Boeing 's Condit is convinced that Airbus wo n't break into the black before 2001 . The weak dollar also hurts Airbus . With sales in dollars , revenues in francs or marks have fallen sharply , meaning planes sell below cost . That , says Demisch of First Boston , means governments must pony up even more , and Airbus may have to hike its prices . Airbus also suffered a setback on April 7 , when a consortium of engine manufacturers led by Pratt &; Whitney said it could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attract jumbo-jet orders . Despite such obstacles , Airbus officials see blue sky ahead in the market that the American plane makers once owned . Someday the name Airbus may even be as well-known in the U.S as Boeing . That 's not yet the case , however . As Airbus 's Boyd recounts , he recently received a call from a woman asking if he " had a bus to Atlantic City that did n't stop in Baltimore . " Let 's face it . You can only do so many things to a cigar-shaped room with all the chairs facing forward . To airplane manufacturers , passengers are payload , and the more people airlines can carry and the faster they can replace them with another payload , the more revenue they can earn . Admits Boeing Vice President Phil Condit , " Most passengers do n't know what plane they 're on . " Airbus is n't conceding the point so easily . In a recent advertising campaign , Airbus plugs its airplanes ' creature comforts to frequent fliers ? wider aisles , 1 inch more hip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quieter engines . Airbus spokesman David Venz says the ads are really aimed at airline executives who decide how many planes to buy . But the improvements , he adds , are substantial . Wider aisles mean that passengers will be able to board and deplane faster . It also means airlines can turn the plane around faster . Boeing is planning a two-aisle , narrow-body jet for 1992 with 2-2-2 seating that will eliminate the center seat . Bigger bins could mean less under-seat cramming of carry-on baggage ? and free up cargo space for freight . Airlines decide the level of creature comforts on their airplanes . Among options being planned are flat-screen TV 's and computers on seat backs for in-flight Pac-Man games or even some serious work . For passengers , some of the biggest advantages have nothing to do with the cabin . Airbus 's and McDonnell Douglas 's longrange junior jumbos will be able to carry passengers from , say , Minneapolis to Milan without passing through a crowded hub ? and at greater frequencies than Boeing 747s.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
