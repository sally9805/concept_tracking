A NOTE of warning to that portion of the movie-going public Alfred Hitchcock used to refer to as " the plausibles " : Stay away from " Eyewitness , " a thoroughly delightful but far from plausible mystery melodrama that operates exclusively on high spirits and a no-nonsense intelligence that is never sidetracked by coherence. // Even the title is misleading . There is a murder in the movie , but the only eyewitnesses to it are the murderer and his victim , neither of whom is about to talk . Far better to call it " The Janitor , " which was the film ' s initial title , since there is a janitor in the movie who hints that he has information about the murder , though not even he pretends to have been an eyewitness . The title is a red herring , but then " Eyewitness " is an ebullient mix of red herrings. // The film , which opens today at the Criterion and other theaters , reunites Peter Yates , director of " Breaking Away , " and Steve Tesich , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here , they are working in another genre entirely , with immense enthusiasm and sometimes very casual attention to details . Because most contemporary movies , including comedies , are so earnestly second-hand in all of their inspirations , it ' s more than a little refreshing to come across a film that is truly , humanely , originally funny , even when it ' s cockeyed. // " Eyewitness " has two plots to start with , and it ' s the desperate attempt to pull them together that , I fear , will send some people out of the theater with murder in their hearts . The only polite thing to say about such people is they lack poetry . " Eyewitness " is the kind of movie that discovers poetry and comedy in the most unexpected places , including once in what appears to be a shirtwaist factory that otherwise has no reason for being in the picture at all. // Plot No. 1 is about Daryll Deever ( William Hurt ) , a good-natured , serious young man who works as a night janitor in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet . Daryll is not especially bookish or ambitious . His dreams are not those of the upwardly mobile . His decency and worth are their own justification , which , you must admit , is fairly avant-garde in this day and age of commercial-movie stereotypes. // Daryll lives an orderly though essentally drab existence . He has two passions , his motorcycle and a growing obsession for a pretty , smart-mouthed television reporter named Tony Sokolow ( Sigourney Weaver ) , whose nightly appearances at 7 and 11 he tapes on his Betamax to replay at his frequent leisure . Daryll is not a creep , but one of the odd things that keeps you hooked to " Eyewitness " is the fear that he may turn into one. // The other plot - and this is the one that is something less than totally convincing or even absorbing - is about an urbane Israeli intelligence agent , played by Christopher Plummer , whose principal mission is to ransom Jews out of the Soviet Union . The film ' s two plots come together when the beautiful , impossibly glib @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigates the murder of a mysterious Vietnamese businessman in the building where Daryll Deever is janitor . To get close to Tony , Daryll claims to know more about the murder than he really does . The ploy works only , as they say in such plot synopses , too well. // More than that I can ' t honestly report , not because I shouldn ' t give away secrets but because I ' m not completely sure ( after one viewing ) what all the secrets are. // " Eyewitness " is not terrifically strong on logic . Instead , it runs on the energy generated by its appealingly oddball characters , all beautifully acted by the members of a large cast of mostly New York actors . Darryl Deever is probably one of the dimmest characters to be seen in any first-rate movie in years , but something happens in Mr. Hurt ' s performance to make him not only credible , but also important . He ' s funny . He ' s sensitive . He is logical ( even when the movie is not ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Hurt ( also to be seen currently in " Altered States " ) convinces us that Daryll Dever has a mind. // Miss Weaver ' s Tony Sokolow also becomes a person of unexpected substance . The attraction that springs up between Tony and the hodrodding janitor , though as bizarre to them as it is to us , is completely believable . Mr. Tesich has the rare ability to crerate characters of weight and concern without half-trying . Those in " Eyewitness " also include Daryll ' s best friend , Aldo ( James Woods ) , a guy who may possibly be a psychopath or possibly just eccentric , whose dearest wish is for Daryll to marry his ( Aldo ' s ) sister ; Daryll ' s rummy old father , played by Kenneth McMillan entirely in a wheelchair , and Aldo ' s aforementioned sister , a tarttongued young woman played by Pamela Reed with the same kind of vivacity that made her role in " Melvin and Howard " memorable. // These characters didn ' t create themselves . They were written by Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so effectively that after a while one doesn ' t worry about the logic that leads from one scare sequence to another and , ultimately , to a smashing finale shot. // Logic doesn ' t score in " Eyewitness , " but intelligence and feelings do . It says something about the age in which we live that a movie that contains these things must be called an eccentric treat . <> <> Poetry and Comedy <> <> EYEWITNESS , directed by Peter Yates ; written by Steve Tesich ; director of photography , Matthew F.
