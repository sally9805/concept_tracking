For Burda Moden magazine , the world 's largest fashion monthly ( est. circ. 2.5 million ) , the year 's trendiest color is without a doubt red . West Germany 's rough equivalent of Vogue is about to become the first capitalist fashion journal to publish a Russian-language Soviet edition . Burda 's initial 100,000- copy Soviet offering , with advertisements from such upscale firms as American Express , Cartier and Adidas , will hit Moscow newsstands on March 3 . Says Manfred Made , director of the magazine 's parent publishing house : " We are thinking in long terms . We believe that the Soviet market will be of immense attraction for Western companies . " <P> The deal to allow Burda to appear four times a year in the Soviet Union was struck last May as part of Mikhail Gorbachev 's campaign to upgrade the quality of Soviet life . Part of the magazine 's expected appeal is that it publishes sewing patterns of its fashion offerings , which Soviet homemakers will be able to copy . Another factor that probably found favor with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and politics , traditional Soviet taboos . At first the new Burda edition will be printed in West Germany , but the plan is to begin printing in Moscow within two years and reach a circulation of 1 million .
