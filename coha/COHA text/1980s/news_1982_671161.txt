But theatergoers who take a more skeptical view of the powers of fate , especially as employed by playwrights , may have a different reaction to " Edmond . " They may conclude , as I did , that on this occasion Mr. Mamet is spinning hooey and neglecting his valuable gifts . In plays like " American Buffalo , " " Sexual Perversity in Chicago " and " The Water Engine , " Mr. Mamet has demonstrated an uncommon ability to hear the voices of inarticulate Americans and to limn the society that oppresses them . Though the thematic concerns are similar in " Edmond , " the author ' s ear has gone tone-deaf , and his social observations have devolved into cliches. // " Edmond , " which opened last night at the Provincetown Playhouse , looks like Georg Buchner ' s " Woyzeck " or maybe selected screenplays by Paul Schrader ( notably " Taxi Driver " and " Hard Core " ) as they might have been rewritten by a Samuel Beckett parodist . Running about 75 intermissionless minutes , the play is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Edmond ( Colin Stinton ) descends from middle-class propriety into hell . The catalysts for his self-destruction are the usual crew of New York demons - pimps and whores , strangers on the subway , three-card-monte dealers and jailhouse sodomizers. // Of the many reasons for this play ' s lack of credibility , the most obvious is the language , which sounds just like that in another illfated Mamet effort , " The Woods . " All the characters in " Edmond " have the same diction - even down to their choice of obscenities . It ' s a clipped , vague form of speech that approximates the manner of Beckett ( and , at times , Buchner ) , but leaves out the substance and spice . Simple declarative sentences are repeated needlessly ; questions are answered with evasions or other questions . Yet whenever Mr. Mamet wants to come to a point , he just announces it - in authorial lines like , " The world seems to be crumbling around us , " or " You can ' t control what you make of your life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no history - there is just now. " // Mr. Mamet dishes out his stylization as if he , too , were a threecard monte dealer : it ' s a shell game designed to distract us from the fact that he ' s not playing with a full deck . Look closely , and even the play ' s premise doesn ' t add up . Why is Edmond , a New York resident , such a naive rube that he ' s shocked or bilked by nearly every stereotypical street hustler he encounters as soon as he leaves his home ? Why does he then , without any visible transition , turn from a milquetoast into an avenger as fearless as Charles Bronson in " Death Wish " ? " Predetermination " isn ' t a satisfactory answer . Neither is the play ' s underlying , knee-jerk sociological bromide that the dehumanized urban jungle reduces all who enter it into beasts. // Eventually , God also gets some blame - He must create a new world " where people are kind to each other " - but not before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his protagonist ' s behavior . As the author has it , Edmond ' s acting out of his darkest impulses allows him to achieve a liberating spiritual breakthrough ; he discovers who he really is , which makes him finally understand that everyone he hates ( women , blacks , homosexuals ) are " people , too . " This allows the evening to end with an unearned sentimental tableau in which the hero holds hands with the cellmate who had earlier raped him. // Because Edmond is a device , not a character , and because Mr. Mamet will toss off any fortune-cookie message to paper over the play ' s various narrative , philosophical and psychological shortcircuits , " Edmond " can , by the end , mean almost anything you wish . This toothless ambiguity is duplicated in the play ' s many incidents , which are impaled by the monochromatic dialogue and performances. // The production has been imported from Chicago ' s Goodman Theater , where it was staged by the author ' s longtime collaborator , Gregory Mosher . While Mr. Mosher and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job of choreographing the constantly shifting settings on a black stage , the direction adds another layer of artifice to the writing . The archest lines and pauses are italicized ; the competent cast of 11 , most playing multiple roles , tends to sound alike . One never feels that individual characters are engaging in the ebb and flow of spontaneous conversation ; even the violent eruptions are too prissily managed to startle us or to justify the titillation the author seems to find in them. // Mr. Stinton , a good actor on other occasions , has a few yelling fits as Edmond , but usually preserves the cool , faceless front and lulling vocal cadences of an insurance salesman no matter what apocalyptic horrors befall him . If he and Mr. Mamet have their way , the world is not going to end with a bang but a long nap . <> <> Self-Destruction <> EDMOND , by David Mamet ; directed by Gregory Mosher ; scenery by Bill Bartelt ; costumes by Marsha Kowal ; lighting by Kevin Rigdon ; fight choreographer , David Woolley ; stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; associate producer , Margot Harley .
