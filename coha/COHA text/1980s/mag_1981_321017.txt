After an implant , a rare Indian ox is born to a Holstein <P> It looked a typical barnyard scene , when a Holstein dairy cow named Flossie gave birth at New York City 's Bronx Zoo last week . Flossie , as would any good bovine mother , promptly began licking the calf , hovered protectively over it , and within an hour started to nurse it . But for zoo officials-indeed , for all animal lovers concerned with preserving endangered species-this blessed event was something very special . Flossie 's offspring was not an ordinary black-and-white Holstein calf but a baby gaur ( rhymes with flower ) , a rare type of wild ox that lives in the remote forests of South Asia from India and Nepal to the Malay Peninsula . <P> Hunted for their meat in some countries and crowded out of favorite hideaways by an expanding human population , no more than about 2,000 of the animals still roam freely in the wild . The dark , white-stockinged creatures are the world 's largest wild cattle . Fully grown , a male gaur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly 2,000 Ibs . Perhaps wisely , no one has really ever bothered to domesticate the beasts . <P> The cross-species delivery in The Bronx is only the second on record involving a wild and a domestic animal . The first took place in 1977 , when two wild Sardinian sheep were born to a domestic sheep at Utah State University . But other attempts involving such kindred creatures as lions and tigers have inexplicably failed . In any case , last week 's success raises hopes that similar transfer techniques can be used to ensure the survival of other endangered species as well . The Bronx Zoo hopes to perform the same feat with a rare Arabian oryx . <P> The cow-ox birth is the result of some extraordinary modern midwifery by Veterinarian Janet Stover , 29 , and her colleagues . To increase the gaur 's chances of survival , they picked a likely mother from the zoo 's own small gaur herd-its 17 members , including the latest addition , account for about 10% of all the gaurs in captivity . The chosen female was then treated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than one egg at a time . Finally , last fall they let the animal breed normally with a gaur bull . <P> Eight days later , University of Pennsylvania Veterinarian James Evans , who earlier this year had supervised another miracle of animal husbandry-the birth of the first " test-tube " domestic cow-flushed five embryos from the gaur 's womb . Four of these were transferred into four Holstein cows , selected in part because their calves are larger than gaur calves . Though the reproductive cycles of all five animals had been synchronized with drugs , one cow did not accept the embryo . Another aborted after five months . The third delivered a dead fetus at 9 months . But two weeks later , Flossie produced a normal gaur calf of about 70 Ibs . ( A normal Holstein calf would weigh up to 90 Ibs . ) Zoo officials , who hope that it will be only the first of a number of gaurs that Flossie may bear , promptly named the shaggy brown calf Manhar , a Hindi word translated roughly as one who wins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his surrogate mother until next spring , when he will be weaned and introduced to the rest of the zoo 's gaur herd . Jokes Stover : " After all , we do n't want him to grow up thinking he is a Holstein. "
