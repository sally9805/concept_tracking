The " petit miracle " of Pierre Larouche became a great deal more grand as Larouche once again scored the first goal and then added the second goal as the improbable Rangers eliminated the Capitals , 2-1 , before 17 , 367 enthusiasts. // Once again the Garden crowd was part of the action , drowning out the national anthem , making a few obscene chants at the visitors and Referee Bryan Lewis and serenading the Washington goalie , Pete Peeters , with their favorite aria , the haunting " Peee-ters , Peee-ters. " // The burst by the Rangers in the past three weeks is one of the more unusual events in the short and apparently finite history of the " new " Garden. // The owner of the Garden , Gulf and Western Industries Inc. , is planning to replace the current building with a new complex farther on the West Side of Manhattan , a billion-dollar land rush that leaves many questions about safety , public transportation and convenience for fans. // But last night , all was euphoria at the fourth Garden , atop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rangers , racked by unhappiness and insecurity earlier in the season , with only one player , Larouche , who can shoot the puck with any consistency , often caught short on shift changes and depleted by injuries and the resignation of Mark Pavelich , stunned a team that finished 29 points ahead of them during the regular season . " I have great respect for the Washington Capitals . Rod Langway and some of the other guys told us to go all the way , " said Larouche , the last player on the traditional handshake line , just ahead of his coach , Ted Sator. // The coach sent Larouche to Hershey , Pa. , before the season and kept him there for 45 games , but both men praised each other last night after the Rangers earned cheers that will echo on this site long after Gulf and Western moves to the western fringe of Manhattan. // The tone was set at 12 minutes 36 seconds of the first period when young Mike Ridley mysteriously slipped the puck under Greg Smith and passed to his left to Larouche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shot . Whirling on his skates , Larouche chipped in a goal with the precision of a golfer standing still and unopposed. // Larouche did it again 34 seconds into the third period , on a power play . He controlled the puck and advanced it with circling tactics , like an eagle with talons extended for the kill . The puck moved over to the right side , where Wilf Paiement shot , Ridley fired a rebound , and then Larouche , always looking for a loose puck , stopped it with his hand and flipped in his second goal. // The Capitals scored on a power play at 5 : 38 , but the Rangers had been given the edge by this artiste , who survived a 45-game exile in Hershey. // Last night Larouche admitted he would rather play Montreal than Hartford , both former teams of his , in the next round. // " Nothing against Hartford , it ' s a great town , but I ' d rather play Montreal because I can see my parents , " said Larouche , who hails from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The heroics by Larouche and John Vanbiesbrouck brought echoes of the Knicks ' winning world championships in 1970 and 1973 in this fourth Garden , which has never quite achieved an intimate character because of its circular , multilevel design , a maze of escalators and stairways , and seats that slope so far back that patrons might as well be in East Rutherford , N.J. // But ambiance is not the reason the good folks at Gulf and Western are rebuilding . The many levels at the current Garden create a reliance on elevators and personnel that raises costs. // The main motive for the move is to allow Gulf and Western to build an office building above the current Garden site , just what is needed in mercilessly overdeveloped Manhattan . There is talk of extending the rail and subway lines to the proposed site between 11th and 12th Avenues and 31st and 33d Streets , but the city ' s record on new subway service is none too good. // The new Garden is supposed to have 20 , 000 seats and a street-level entrance , but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People who create sports arenas always seem to be designing their first one. // Shea Stadium was outmoded the day it opened in 1964 , with only one elevator for the Diamond Club and one for carrying hot dogs , garbage and the press . Dodger Stadium didn ' t have water fountains , and the builders of the Astrodome assumed grass would grow under a glass roof , which led directly to the stifling combination of artificial turf and indoor baseball. // At the Astrodome they have run out of new tourists , and residents have grown bored with a lackluster team , so John McMullen is engaged in a mating dance with Washington , which has an outdoor stadium but no proven clientele. // There are questions , too , about the Meadowlands , dependent upon automobile traffic on dreadfully crowded bridges , tunnels and highways . Giants Stadium does fine for the Giants and Jets , but the struggling New Jersey Devils and the chaotic New Jersey Nets lack a regional identity , casting doubt upon the Meadowlands for a daily , walk-in sport like baseball. // Gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the old Gardens because of fans streaming in from the city streets . Maybe the planners can revive the excitement of the third Garden by putting in a central marquee , with a Nedick ' s and a few telephone booths out front. // At the proposed West Side site , all the money they ' ll make in the land rush might have to go for hiring bodyguards to protect players and fans at Gulf and Western ' s proposed new Fort Apache. // For the present , the Rangers are winning , and Sator noted , " Next year they can come up with a banner that says ' Patrick Division Champions . ' " No matter where Gulf and Western moves , that banner will remind people of this strange night in late April when roses , straw skimmers , balloons , ticker tape and other paper goods came streaming out of the stands. //
