Only a few years ago , Western Europe seemed overwhelmed by a malady known as Europessimism . Now the mood is closer to Europhoria . And with good reason : from Scandinavia to Italy , most countries are enjoying annual economic growth in the comfortable 2%-to-4% range , stock markets are strong , and corporate profits are robust . Most impressive , West European exports have surged by 33% in the past three years , from $689 billion in 1983 to $916.4 billion in 1986 . With the U.S. alone , Western Europe enjoyed a trade surplus of $18.2 billion last year , a sharp contrast to the $2.9 billion deficit of 1983 . <P> That overseas prowess is not dependent solely on sales of such consumer products as BMWs and Bordeaux wine . Other important export categories range from chemicals and pharmaceuticals to industrial machinery and office equipment .

While the U.S. space shuttle remains grounded , Arianespace , the commercial arm of the 13-nation European Space Agency , has in eight years put a total of 19 satellites in space and signed an additional 44 launch contracts worth $2.38 billion . <P> For all the renewed confidence in Europe , however , a few strains of Europessimism linger . Europeans realize that in the mid-1980s their exports to the U.S. received a mighty boost from the rise in the value of the dollar , which made imports less expensive for American consumers and businesses . Now that the dollar has taken a dive , Europe 's export industries are feeling pressure once again . Another concern is sluggish investment . Despite healthy earnings , many of Europe 's companies are not devoting enough money to modernizing and expanding factories . Instead , firms are stashing cash in high- yielding money-market securities or buying up other companies in Europe and the U.S. Warns an economist at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's industrial assets are being reshuffled in a major way . But is this a prelude to better management of those assets or just portfolio game playing ? " <P> Yet fundamental and positive changes are taking place . In several European nations bloated and inefficient nationalized industries are shrinking in size , losing government subsidies and , in many cases , being turned over to private enterprise . The British government has sold to the public major shares of its national airline and telephone and gas companies . In France Conservative Premier Jacques Chirac is carrying out a sweeping reversal of the nationalizations that Socialist President Francois Mitterrand engineered in the early 1980s.
