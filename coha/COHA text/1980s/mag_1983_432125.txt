 | In the almost three years since she left the White House , the daughter of the former president has blossomed into a beauty , with a mind of her own Amy Carter , daughter of the Athirty-ninth president of the United States , says people still tend to think she 's the same little Amy who lived in the White House . The images of her have stuck : The nineyear-old kid with glasses and braids , trudging past reporters with her lunch pail on her first day in public school ; the lonely little girl with a dog named Grits for a companion ; the dressed-up child at a formal state dinner , reading a book at the table . Amy does n't mind a bit . She vows the past has been good and the present is the happiest time of her life . On October 19 she 'll be 16 years old , and for the first time she 'll be living away from home ? a junior in a private coeducational boarding school in the South . She 's been waiting " forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age recognizes her . The glasses have been replaced by contact lenses . Her blonde hair is layered and shimmers from daily shampoos . The freckles have almost disappeared from her milky skin , and her cheekbones are lightly touched with blusher . The braces on her teeth still sparkle ? but so do the tiny gold earrings in her pierced ears . Friends say she is loyal , freespirited , original . Her parents say she has always been strong and independent . Still , after living in the relentless spotlight cast over presidents '  | children , after being uprooted from Plains , Ga. , to the governor 's mansion in Atlanta , to the White House in Washington , and back again ? can Amy Carter ever fit into the mainstream ? A few weeks ago as she prepared to go away to school , to leave behind her home , family , friends ? and the security agents who 've always followed her ? I visited Amy to find out what she 's really like today . It 's early morning in the Carters ' ranch house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosalynn Carter calls from across the hall to awaken her daughter . She knows Amy likes this time of the day to be alone . She fixes her own breakfast , anything from a croissant to tomato soup or a slice of pizza . ( She 's 5 feet 4 inches , weighs 124 pounds , and her mother warns her to watch her weight . ) Back in her room she dutifully practices the violin , which she 's played for seven years , or works out on the piano , which she took up recently . Then she turns the stereo on ? and up . The music reflects the posters on her walls : The Ramones , Jim Morrison , The Clash , The Psychedelic Furs . " I do n't like just one kind of music , " Amy says . " I 'm really into New Wave , I guess you 'd call it , which is kind of mild Punk . " She recently wrote a term paper on the Punk/New Wave movement and sometimes wears black nail polish " for fun . " While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every morning she walks out the front door with wet hair plastered to her head and dripping down her back . " It drives me crazy ! " her father says . " I do n't like to look varnished , " Amy says . She 's wearing faded blue jeans , a gray T-shirt stenciled with a picture of The Ramones , and bright red ankle boots . " Parents worry too much about surface things like clothes and hair . " She smiles , adding , " My mom always looks great ! " A my 's room is stuffed full of memorabilia attesting to the life she 's led . A jar of ash from Mount St. Helens , water from the South Pole , a puck from the winning U.S. Olympic hockey  | team , a cricket ball from England . She shows off a clock her father brought her from Europe and fondly observes it 's the " tackiest " thing she owns . Tiny objects ? little animals , boxes , dollhouse furniture ? clutter every open surface in her room . " Actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Amy admits . She opens a folder of papers and pulls out an old clipping from the Washington Post with a photo of her cat , Misty Malarky Ying Yang , creeping down the White House staircase in front of a head of state . Among her other papers are letters from her dad when he was away on important trips and a letter from her nephew , Jason , 6 , telling her how much he likes to celebrate " Crimis " in Plains with his " Ant Amy . " This year Amy was given a telephone for her room . " I can fool around alone in here for hours , calling friends , listening to music , sleeping , watching TV , " she says . " But I usually end up reading , " she adds . In fact , by far the most dominant thing in Amy 's room is her large and unusual collection of books . I n shelves by her bed she keeps volumes by James Agee , Ray Bradbury , Edgar Rice Burroughs , Thomas Hardy . Here and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nathaniel Hawthorne , are Agatha Christie , Barbara Cartland , Jacqueline Susann , and Norman Mailer . Amy has never been cencored by her parents . " I guess Kurt Vonnegut 's my favorite right now , " she muses . Her friends all bring up her obsession with books . " I just go for the Harlequins , " says Courtney Moore , probably Amy 's closest friend . " She goes for War and Peace . " Not long ago , at her father 's suggestion , Amy memorized Dylan Thomas 's Refusal to Mourn a Child 's Death in London by Fire . A few days later Jimmy Carter found the poem copied out in delicate calligraphy , framed and propped up on his bureau . Her friends admire her originality . " Who else would send a letter on a blank jigsaw puzzle that had 1,001 pieces to fit together ? " says her friend Courtney .  | " Back in Washington , " Courtney goes on , " when we had sleep-over parties , Amy was the one with the intriguing ideas , like washing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cricket Keating , analyzes Amy this way : " There 's school smart and creative smart . She 's both . " Rosalynn 's mother , Allie Smith , and I have joined the Carter family for dinner . After the meal Amy clears the table and helps with the dishes . Back in her room she talks about the way it usually is when only the Carters dine together . " Everybody argues , but not in a bad way , " she says enthusiastically . " We 're all different and have different points of view . I know my parents would rather I have an opinion than just go along . " Her father adds , " Amy 's the best personal debater in the family . She marshalls facts , digs in , never gives up , and is , in fact , eloquent . " " Independence is a strong family trait , " says Jack , 36 , the eldest of the Carter children . Judy , his wife , believes that debating issues has always been a central activity holding the Carters together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , " she says . " Amy 's had to hold up her end and she 's done it well . She 's always been determined to be herself , " says her brother Jeff , 32 . " My little sister can demolish you in a discussion if you 're not on solid ground , " says Chip , 33 . Still , nobody can remember Amy ? the late child in the Carter family and the only daughter ? ever defying her parents . Everyone insists she naturally " fit in " with both adults and kids , was n't a pest to her much older brothers , and has n't been spoiled ? except by the family 's longtime housekeeper , Mary Prince , who sometimes cleans up the mess in her room . When Amy visits her ailing grandmother , Lillian Carter , she is sweet and gentle with her . " We trust her , " says Rosalynn Carter . " She 'll tell you if she 's done something wrong . She 's so self-assured , she does n't think about misleading you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself yet fit in with her family , Amy counters thoughtfully : " For so long Dad 's word has been like gospel . I suppose one day I wo n't be willing to accept that , but so far there 's never been anything that bothered me enough to make a huge production out of it . But Mom and Dad know I 'll stand up for what I think is right . " Amy still vividly remembers the surprise and hurt she felt when her father lost the election and she left behind her friends in Washington . Courtney Moore recalls how she and Amy 's other friends said good-bye before Amy went back to Plains in 1981 . " She did n't talk about what had happened to her father . We knew she was upset , so we all went over to the White House for three straight days supposedly to help her pack . Instead we went wild , skating and playing ball and roaming all over . We tried hard to have a good time for those last daysand we did . " On a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit the White House staff on a weekend when the Reagans were away at Camp David Amy says she felt little emotion walking through the White House halls again . But out by the swimming pool , when she found a plastic thermos a maid had saved from her father 's White House days , she impulsively filled the thermos with " Reagan Administration " water . It is one of the prized possessions in her room .  | In 1982 Amy spent the summer on Capitol Hill as a senate page . " It was one of the best things I 've done in my entire life , " she says . " You 're off and on the senate floor all the time and you work really hard . " I would n't want to run for anything , but I think everyone should follow politics , " she continues . " I think about the issues , like the nuclear freeze . I do n't know how anybody ca n't be for that . " Amy says she has no definite career plans yet , though she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I expect I 'll work all my life at something , " she says . " Everyone in my family always has . " She 'd like to get married " at about thirty " and have " one or two " children . The subject of dating comes up , and she says there have always been boys in her crowd . But ? with the exception of one year in her life ? there have always been security agents around her , too , and she feels she 's probably missed out on things because of her protected life . Does she get more attention from people because she is who she is , or do they tend to shy away from her ? " At a party someone might introduce me as Jimmy Carter 's daughter , " Amy says , " but after you talk awhile the other person either likes you or not . They ca n't keep faking it . Everyone worries might think that being a president 's daughter is the real reason I 'm asked on a date , but I 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her talk , Amy seems remarkably easygoing about growing up in the public eye . In spite of some " stupid " stories about her , she says she 's not really leery of the press . But she is cool about publicly expressing private opinions on issues such as teenagers and alcohol , drugs , smoking , or sex . " I do n't believe that what I think would make a difference to anybody else , " she says . " You have to make those decisions for yourself . For a long time my parents have laid down what they hope I 'll do and what they think is best , and you know , I 've heard about all I want to hear . I can always go to them if something really troubles me . " As she gets ready to leave home for the first time , does Amy Carter feel ready to handle the responsibilities that come with her new independence ? " Of course , " she says flatly .
