Wappingers Falls is so ordinary that it could serve as a set for the old television show Twilight Zone . Eighty miles up the Hudson River from New York City , the Dutchess County town has an unassuming 1950s air . A highway strip of car dealerships and fast-food joints leads into a village centered on a grassy park with a bandstand . A sign on Main Street announces Saturday-night bingo at St. Mary 's Church . The biggest employer is IBM . The second biggest is New York State , which maintains a scattering of prisons and hospitals in the area . <P> And like a Twilight Zone set , Wappingers Falls ( pop . 5,000 ) has become the scene of a netherworld nightmare , a place where reality seems as distorted as a fun-house mirror . Last Nov. 24 Tawana Brawley , a 15-year-old black girl , got off a bus on Route 9 and disappeared . Four days later the onetime cheerleader was found in a daze , crawling into a garbage bag in the backyard of her family 's former apartment complex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog feces , her chest inscribed in charcoal with the letters KKK and the word NIGGER . At the hospital , a black policeman asked Brawley , " Who did it ? " She reached for his badge and scrawled on a piece of paper , " white cop . " <P> Brawley gave a disjointed story of being sexually assaulted in the woods by six white men . Shortly afterward , black activists from New York City arrived in Wappingers Falls to take charge of the case . On their advice , Brawley clammed up , refusing to provide investigators with further details . In the ensuing months , the case exploded into a statewide political and racial controversy , bathed in a glow of national publicity . <P> In a stunning and unexpected turn , last week Brawley 's lawyers called a news conference and identified a Dutchess County assistant district attorney as one of her attackers . That set the stage for a catch-22 impasse : the lawyers refuse to provide evidence until arrests are made , while law-enforcement officials say they can not arrest anyone without evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dec. 2 suicide of a part-time policeman ; the withdrawal from the case by the local district attorney , who cited an unspecified conflict of interest ; and a history of violence in the Brawley family . <P> Against this backdrop , an eccentric cast of characters has been winding its way through the Wappingers Falls mystery in a human tapestry worthy of Tom Wolfe 's novel The Bonfire of the Vanities . Comedian Bill Cosby and Edward Lewis , publisher of Essence magazine , teamed up to offer a $25,000 reward for information in the case . Boxing Champion Mike Tyson spent six hours with Brawley , during which , he said , they did not discuss what had happened ; he did bestow his $30,000 diamond-studded Rolex watch upon her . Black Muslim Leader Louis Farrakhan flew in from Chicago to address busloads of protesters transported upstate from New York City . <P> The publicity has been orchestrated by Brawley Lawyers Alton Maddox and Vernon Mason , veterans of New York City 's race-drenched politics , and Pentecostal Minister Al Sharpton , a rabble-rouser from Brooklyn who calls New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney General Robert Abrams , special prosecutor in the case , to Hitler . Sharpton even contends that the assault is part of a racist plot linked to the Irish Republican Army .
