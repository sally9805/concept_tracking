With an increasing number of land disputes leading the way , court cases in Du Page County rose by more than 12 percent in 1988 , according to figures released by John Cockrell , clerk of the Circuit Court . The category of lawsuit that increased the greatest amount in Du Page ' s Circuit Court-the second largest circuit in the state-was eminent domain , the legal taking of land by a government for use by the public . In 1988 various state and local governments asked Du Page judges 275 times , an increase of 161 percent over 1987 , to help settle the question of how much a property is worth . Four years ago , there were only 10 eminent domain suits filed in the county . The three main sources of the 275 condemnation cases are filings : by state and local governments purchasing land for the North-South Tollway and street improvements along its feeder routes ; by the county forest preserve district in connection with its aggressive land acquisition program ; and by the county water commission for its project to bring Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the county ' s population increases in the last decade as the principal reason for increased traffic through the courts . In 1980 , the county ' s official population was 653 , 660 , and in 1986 it was 715 , 800 . Now , most county officials place the Du Page population from 750 , 000 to 800 , 000 . Also on the rise are tax objection lawsuits , with 3 , 501 filed , an increase of 20 percent over 1987 and an increase of more than 700 percent since 1983 . " Du Page County is growing and that accounts for most of the increase in the different caseloads , " said Ross Tolan , president of the Du Page County Bar Association . " With growth , also comes the need for new parks , new recreation space , new roads , new schools , " he said . " All this also has meant tremendous jumps in real estate taxes and obvious some people believe those increases are unfair .

The circuit ' s 10 judges and 24 associate judges have the largest caseload per judge in the state , according to Chief Judge Carl F.J. Henninger . Henninger has said he is constantly trying and hoping to get more judgeships open in Du Page , but that nothing is currently imminent .

Officials believe operations will improve with the 1991 opening of the new county courthouse near the county ' s main governmental complex on County Farm and Manchester Roads , on Wheaton ' s west side . " Once things get centrally located and we get our courtrooms together , things will move even more swift , " Tolan said . But more people don ' t always mean that more bad things are happening . Although 3 , 484 couples asked county judges to dissolve their marriages in 1988 , an increase of only 4 percent over 1987 ; the 1988 figure is still less than the first three years of the decade , including the high mark year of 1981 with 3 , 805 cases.
