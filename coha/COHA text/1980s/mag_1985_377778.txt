Ladies and gentlemen , boys and girls , dyin ' time 's here . " With that genial salutation , the hunchbacked emcee greets a braying mob assembled for the evening 's entertainment at Thunderdome . Welcome to a death duel between that stoic wanderer of the postapocalypse Australian wasteland , Mel Gibson 's Mad Max , and his monstrous iron-masked opponent , known as Blaster . You are privileged to witness , as well , an astonishing display of virtuoso cinema that is destined to take its place among the most vivid and freshly imagined fist-to-groin contests in the medium 's history . <P> The dome itself is of the geodesic variety , an open latticework of metal bars on which the crowd clambers and clings , forming a subhuman wall of ecstatically writhing bodies and bloodlusting faces . Scattered about the structure are various objects useful in carnage ( a chain saw , a huge mallet , a viciously shaped sword of superhuman dimensions ) . The gladiators are placed in slings that are in turn attached to industrial-strength rubber bands . Boiing ! They bounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alarming force . Piing ! They are catapulted into the dome 's upper reaches , grabbing frantically for whatever weapon comes to flailing hand . Spriing ! They 're back on the ground , whaling away at each other . As their ever encouraging ringmaster says , " You know the rules : there are no rules . " <P> There are rules , though , for movie-makers ; they have a duty to entertain and , especially when they are projecting the future , offer cautionary instruction to the audience . How effortlessly this sequence does both . For Thunderdome is both hall of justice and cultural center for Bartertown , presided over by Aunty Entity ( Tina Turner ) , purring like a tiger and claiming she has created civilization 's highest flowering since nuclear devastation . Indeed she has , if an imitation of late 20th century city life  --  all junk , improvisations and random brutality  --  is your idea of civilization . Thunderdome brilliantly clarifies that irony . Its high-bounding excesses of action simultaneously satisfy and satirize the passion for heedless viciousness that so profoundly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ males . They can be relied on not to notice or care about the sequence 's central irony : that the decisive weapon in the struggle between Max and Blaster is , of all innocent objects , a simple silver whistle . <P> If this third film in the Mad Max cycle had stopped there , it might have been some kind of low , visionary masterpiece . But " beyond Thunderdome " lies only preacherly anticlimax . Cast out into the wilderness for failing to live up to Barter-town 's dog-eat-dog code , Max is rescued by a tribe of lost children as the savior their mythology has promised them . When the talk drags , he leads them on a crusade of the innocents against Aunty and her crowd . <P> Their final confrontation , a running vehicular battle , is spectacular enough , but it traverses terrain that George Miller and the rest of Max 's creators have fully charted before . Once again , as they did in The Road Warrior , they have flirted with greatness . The question that remains for Mad Max IV to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go all solemn when they do ?  --  By Richard Schickel
