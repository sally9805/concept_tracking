His reports for the youth program of the National Radio never strayed too far from the party line . But when tens of thousands of Czechoslovaks took to the streets demonstrating for democracy three weeks ago , he and his fellow reporters also revolted . They began broadcasting the protests live. // // ' ' It was a gradual process , ' ' recalls Mr. Kroupika . ' ' First , we began reporting differing opinions . Our editors didn ' t stop us . Then we reported a little more . When the editors tried to stop us , we didn ' t listen . We just told the truth. ' ' // Vladimir Lenin once said that the press packed more power than guns . The rebellion by journalists like Kroupika proves him correct. // Throughout Eastern Europe , not only in Czechoslovakia , a press rebellion is playing an important role in overthrowing the communist system . At a crucial moment , subservient journalists switched sides and joined the wave of popular protest . Without their truthful reporting , opposition activists agree that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their totalitarian regimes. // ' ' Information was key , ' ' recalls Anna Polakova of Czechoslovakia ' s opposition group , Civic Forum . ' ' Once the masses knew the what had happened , they supported us. ' ' // For years , East Europeans received objective news reports via Western shortwave radio - Voice of America , the BBC , or Radio Free Europe . These broadcasts were indispensible . But they never could replace the impact of the local news media , especially on the less educated or on working or farming classes . Seeing one ' s own television or hearing one ' s own radio carrying previously banned material has a tremendous impact. // These days , people crowd pubs in Prague watching television news and stand in streets listening to the radio reports . Newspapers in East Berlin are sold out by 5 : 30 a. m. - even the official communist daily Neues Deutschland. // ' ' I get up at 4 a. m. just to buy a newspaper , ' ' reports Romy Kocher , an activist in East Germany ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know what ' s going on. ' ' // ' ' I used to just read books , ' ' adds Karin Dieckelmann , an East Berlin book shop manager . ' ' Now I try to read six to seven newspapers each day. ' ' // Contrary to popular perception , the East European press never endured overt censorship . It instead was shackled by a subtle combination of self-restraint and editorial control . All senior editors , along with most journalists , were required to be members of the Communist Party. // ' ' There was no censor , there didn ' t have to be , ' ' explains Kroupicka . ' ' You either just didn ' t dare broadcast what you thought , or if you did , the editor would reprimand you the next day. ' ' // When the crisis struck , this system of control crumbled . Many journalists never were committed communists . They joined the party out of opportunism. // ' ' I joined when I was 22 , ' ' the 26-year-old Kroupicka admits , shrugging his shoulders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career. ' ' // Mikhail Gorbachev ' s experiment in glasnost ( openness ) emboldened journalists to take chances . On Mikroforum , Kroupicka ' s radio show , reporters began tackling sensitive subjects concerning young people - subjects like drugs , alcoholism , and AIDS. // ' ' We never took on the real difficult taboos , ' ' he says . ' ' We were 70 percent objective and we tried to stretch the limits. ' ' // Some criticized this strategy as ' ' easy glasnost . ' ' Others , including the leading opposition spokesman Vaclav Havel , saw it as drobna prace or small work : honest and responsible work in widely different areas of life which would stimulate national creativity and national self-confidence. // In this view , such work represents a practical way of confronting a heavily armed totalitarian system , biding time for the propitious moment to take a more dramatic , defiant stand for political reform. // ' ' This is no black and white , no absolute right and wrong , ' ' Havel says . ' ' Anybody that presses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good. ' ' // As street protests mounted in Prague , the moment to take more dramatic action arrived . Kroupika and his fellow journalists stopped spouting the official line , and the loyal party director tried to stop them . The journalists responded with a threat to close down operations. // ' ' The director just couldn ' t control us , ' ' Kroupicka recalls . ' ' We ignored him. ' ' // Within hours , the radio journalists had banded together and launched a petition drive to force the director ' s resignation . He refused . The journalists again threatened to strike . The director resigned. // Similar scenes have been taking place throughout the East European press. // In Poland , the new Solidarity government appointed Andrzej Drawicz head of the crucial Committee for Radio and Television Affairs , long the key propoganda tool of the Communists . The new chairman ' s first act was to fire the three national news anchors , who were identified with the Communists. // In East Germany , the BerlinerZeitung editor resigned for health reasons . The newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former high party officials. // ' ' We ' re 100 percent free , ' ' says diplomatic correspondent Klaus Wyczynski . ' ' We just write what we want. ' ' // This new freedom presents some problems . Long-stifled journalists must learn new responsibilities . Mr. Wyczynski explains how in one case an inexperienced reporter wrote a false , libelous article accusing a government official of corruption . The frightened official appeared the next morning at the newspaper ' s headquarters. // ' ' Before we journalists didn ' t have to think for ourselves , ' ' Wyczynski says . ' ' We must learn to not abuse our powers. ' ' // Back in Czechoslovakia , the new noncommunist government hopes to institutionalize freedom of the press . Long-banned newspapers such as Lidovie Noviny suddenly are legal , and the independent Civic Forum movement hopes to put out its own daily. // These moves may not be as important as Milek Kroupicka ' s rebellion. // ' ' I never will be scared again , ' ' he says .
