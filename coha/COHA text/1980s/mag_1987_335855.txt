When Robert Holmes a Court comes calling , most corporate chiefs hide the company silver . A sly and extraordinarily patient Australian financier , Holmes a Court has built Bell Group , a $2 billion corporate empire that reaches from oil and gas interests near Tasmania to theaters in London 's West End , by capturing troubled companies one at a time . Now the raider is circling around Texaco , and no one is entirely certain of his intentions . <P> Holmes a Court , 49 , made an initial move three months ago , after Texaco was forced into bankruptcy proceedings by its debilitating legal battle with Pennzoil . He announced that he had paid $541 million for 6.4% of Texaco 's 242 million outstanding shares " exclusively for purposes of investment . " Wall Street experts have wondered ever since whether he might have more than a passive holding in mind . That speculation grew last week as Holmes a Court , who now holds 9.6% of Texaco 's shares , said he is seeking U.S. Government approval to increase his stake to as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil company ( 1986 revenues : $32.6 billion ) . That could give him important input into corporate decision making at the beleaguered oil firm . <P> Born in South Africa , the son of a prosperous British rancher , Holmes a Court ( the family name dates from the Norman Conquest in 1066 ) studied law in Perth , in western Australia , and decided to settle there . But the young attorney hit his stride once he got into investing . Often underestimated by his opponents , the lanky Holmes a Court has since 1970 won control of transportation , entertainment , publishing , mining and petroleum concerns around the world . Today , with a net worth of some $250 million , he is reputedly Australia 's wealthiest citizen . A reclusive investor , Holmes a Court prefers being at home with his wife Janet and four teenage children to hanging out at an executive watering hole . To relax , he plays chess against a computer . He owns an extensive collection of mostly Australian art and a stable of some 200 Thoroughbred racehorses . <P> Holmes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more than a shrewd gamble on the firm 's long-term health and its ability to reach a settlement with Pennzoil . Looking at the company 's substantial oil and gas reserves and other holdings , most financial analysts think that Texaco 's shares are severely undervalued at last week 's closing price of 45 1/8 . In the past , Holmes a Court has ended raids on target firms when the price was right . Last August , for example , he said he was seeking a 15% stake in USX . Then , as takeover speculation drove up the price of the stock , he reportedly turned a handsome profit on a block of his shares . Still , Texaco may look tempting to Holmes a Court , who has said he wants to establish a sizable U.S. industrial base . Texaco officials welcomed his vote of confidence in the value of their company 's shares but said they would fight any attempt to take over the firm .
