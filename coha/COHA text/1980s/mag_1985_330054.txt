Nearly 18 years ago , Joseph Stalin 's only daughter , Svetlana Alliluyeva , defected to the West bearing an astonishing message . At a New York City press conference that was televised around the world , and later in two books , the child of one of modern history 's most brutal tyrants repudiated her father and Communism , while affirming her faith in God and freedom . Svetlana 's defection was more than a propaganda coup for the West : it was a symbolic event in the moral imagination of millions of people . The child of the man who stood accused of having killed more people than Adolf Hitler had escaped with her humanity intact . <P> Last October Svetlana returned to the Soviet Union , taking her American-born daughter Olga , 13 , with her . Once again her action could be seen as symbolic , signifying , perhaps , some basic failure of Western values . She told a press conference in Moscow that she had not known " one single day " of freedom in the West . She declared that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two children she had left behind in 1967 . But her earlier denunciations of the Bolshevik revolution ( " a fatal , tragic mistake " ) , her father ( " a moral and spiritual monster " ) , the Soviet system ( " profoundly corrupt " ) and the KGB ( like " the German Gestapo " ) suggested that her return may have been a desperate , in a sense almost a suicidal act . <P> What had gone wrong for Svetlana in the West ? Why did she return to the country she had fled in abhorrence ? The answers are multifaceted , even contradictory , like Svetlana 's personality as it gradually and painfully revealed itself during her sojourn in the West . <P> Judging from interviews with many people who knew her in the U.S. , where she lived from 1967 to 1982 , and in Britain , where she spent the past two years , Svetlana was an often charming but restless , unhappy and quarrelsome woman . Her feverish enthusiasm for people and places could quickly turn into disappointment and recrimination , as evidenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In retrospect , it seems clear that her ultimate quarrel was with her father , whom she fatefully resembled . As she once said about the Soviet people , Stalin 's " shadow still stands over all of us . It still dictates to us , and we very often obey . " The story of Svetlana 's life is the chronicle of her losing battle with the specter of her father . <P> In 1967 , when Svetlana arrived in the U.S. following her defection during a visit to India , little of her inner conflict was visible . The face she turned on a mesmerized U.S. public was alight with happiness . A handsome , vibrant woman of 41 , with crisp , coppery curls , ruddy cheeks , shy blue eyes and a winning smile , she exuded sweetness and candor . She seemed pleased by her celebrity  --  and by the $1.5 million she earned from her first book of memoirs , Twenty Letters to a Friend . Well-wishers kept the house she rented in Princeton , N.J. , filled with flowers . Fan letters , presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people lionized her . Amid such warm attention , she did not appear to worry unduly about her children in Moscow . Joseph , 22 , and Yekaterina ( " Katya " ) , 17 , were already grown up , she explained . " The life of my children will not be changed . "
