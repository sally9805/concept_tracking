THE FUMIGATION CHAMBER No one could diagnose the cause of Betty Page 's mysterious symptoms , but they all seemed somehow connected with the cottage at the lake . by Berton Rouec14 Illustrated by Craig Stillwell woman I 'll call Betty Page was awakened in the middle of the night , around three o'clock on the morning of Wednesday , May 30 , 1984 , by a spasm of nausea . She sat up with a lurch and a groan . Her husband , Lewis , lifted his head and asked what was the matter . She told him . She said she did n't understand it  --  she just felt sick and awful . She crouched there , wondering . Then she had an impulse . She had a sudden craving for milk  --  for a cup of warm milk . She went down to the kitchen and put some milk in a pan on the stove to heat . She drank a steaming cupful , sipping slowly , cautiously . She began to feel better . She went back to bed and fell asleep , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fieldstone house in Jenkintown , Pennsylvania , a pleasant suburb of Philadelphia . They also have a weekend cottage on a lake in northern Pennsylvania  --  a three-hour drive from their home  --  and a condominium apartment in Aspen , Colorado . Betty Page is a small woman , grayly blond with blue eyes and a wide , smiling mouth , and in May 1984 she had just turned 57 . Lewis Page  --  big , bald , serenely poised  --  was 60 . The Pages are both physicians . Lewis Page ( Harvard College , the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine ) is an obstetrician and gynecologist in private practice . Betty Page ( Wellesley College and Temple University School of Medicine , where she was elected to Alpha Omega Alpha , the Phi Beta Kappa of medicine ) is an internist , and at that time was an assistant professor of clinical medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine . She is now , and has been for three years or more , on leave from her academic duties . And for good reason . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Betty Page told me in a conversation we had not long ago in her home . " They 've been happy years . We have a lot more in common than just medicine . But we have our differences . I like to ski , and he prefers scuba diving . His hobby is mineralogy . Mine is archaeology . His glass is always half full . Mine is always half empty . That was the way it was on that Wednesday three years ago , after that night . Lewis was satisfied that it was just one of those things . I was n't so sure . I was still feeling a little funny . But I had some big distractions that took my mind off myself . Not just my work . Our daughter was getting married in July , on the 28th , and , as the mother of the bride , a lot of the arrangements devolved on me  --  for one thing , the invitations , the calligraphy . Plus I was making my own dress . Still , I got through the day on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , I fell right to sleep  --  and then it was the night before all over again . Except worse . This time , the warm milk was n't really very effective . I took some Tigan , an anti-nausea medicine , and that helped , but only a little . And along with the nausea I had a little crampy feeling , abdominal cramps ? what used to be called green-apple cramps . I got through the night . The next day , I did what I had to do , but it was n't easy . I had an attack of diarrhea . I tell you , I felt like h ? . Thursday night was another bad night . About the only thing that kept me going was the thought of our cottage on the lake . We had opened the cottage on the Memorial Day weekend  --  May 25 , that year  --  as we always do . Actually , I had done most of the opening , starting on the Friday . Lewis sees patients all day Friday , and until late on Friday evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So now , a week later  --  that would have been Friday , June 1 ? I took off for the lake . I love the lake . I always feel wonderful there . It beckoned to me like a haven . " I felt some better when got there . I began to think , to hope , that I was overreacting . I did the necessary marketing and got settled for the weekend . There was a lot of work to do . It was a little discouraging . I thought we had done all that the weekend before . The cottage is set in a lovely hemlock wood , and when we went up on the Memorial Day weekend there was hemlock pollen everywhere in the cottage . And now , a week later , there was another dusting of pollen all over the place . So I went to work again . Lewis arrived sometime after midnight . I woke up and we talked a moment , and then another wave of nausea came over me . Milk helped , enough to let me get back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the lake , but I really was n't feeling any better . The nausea came and went , and my mouth was always filling with saliva . I kept having to spit . My abdominal cramps continued . And the diarrhea . I did n't complain to Lewis . I tried to keep it even from myself . I took my temperature . It was normal . That was something , but I still felt just punk . Lewis drove back home on Sunday evening , as usual , and I stayed over for another day of rest and then to close up the cottage . I drove down home on Monday afternoon . I hated to leave the lake and go back to work . I was sick , and I knew it . " Well , now we were into June . I kept thinking , hoping , that tomorrow or the day after or the day after that I 'd wake up feeling better . But nothing changed . I never vomited , but 1 was nauseated almost all the time . I had clammy cold sweats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost my taste for food . A little milk , some Cream of Wheat  --  I lived on baby food like that . My normal weight is around I W. Now I was losing something like a pound a week . And I was getting worried  --  really worried . I had a breast cancer back in 1963 , and a radical mastectomy . There had never been any suggestion of a recurrence . But there is something that everybody who has ever had any kind of cancer knows . There is always a sort of subliminal anxiety . An ache , a pain , a feeling not quite normal , and you think , Is it cancer ? So I pulled myself together and called a gastroenterologist I knew and made an appointment . Doctors are like lawyers . Lawyers do n't represent themselves in court . I kept my appointment , and the gastroenterologist heard my complaints and was very concerned . He gave me a full examination  --  the complete mouth-to-anus workup . The results were negative , entirely normal . That should have been good news . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustrated too . So he did what so many doctors do in a situation like that : he went the functional route . What else ? He reminded me that I was almost 60 . He said , ' Betty , your trouble is that you 're not growing old gracefully . ' He said , ' Wait until the wedding is over . You 're simply a nervous mother . Your histrionics are getting out of hand . ' He said , ' Take a little nap in the afternoon . Try to relax . ' He prescribed a medication . It was a mixture of his own  --  a mood elevator and a tranquilizer . I took his nostrum , and I thought I was going to die . I could hardly breathe . It did something to my chest muscles . I did n't have the power to move air in and out of my lungs . I got rid of the nostrum and at once felt better . I mean , at least I could breathe again . " I may have been a nerv-ous mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of my illness . The day of Elizabeth 's wedding came , and everything went off very smoothly , very beautifully ? and I still felt sick . I had to take a leave of absence from my job . I could n't manage anymore . I was n't exactly idle . I had undertaken an ecological study of our lake . There is an association of families who summer there , and I was expected to read my report at the an-nual meeting , on Labor Day . I thought if I paced myself I could make the deadline . My long weekends at the lake gave me plenty of time to do the necessary research . And rest . needed rest . The symptoms that sent me to the gastroenterologist were still with me , and I also had some new ones . I was feeling a very unpleasant tightness in my chest , a viselike feel-ing , and my heart , even at rest , seemed to be skipping beats . You know how we doctors have fragment-ed ourselves with our medical special-ties . My reaction was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my symptoms . When my symptoms were gastrointestinal , I went to a gastroenterologist . Now my heart seemed to be acting up , so I went to a cardiologist . I do n't think he prescribed a nostrum . But the results were much the same as last time . He gave me a thorough examination  --  everything known to cardiac technology . There was apparently nothing wrong with my heart . Then some new symptoms began to develop . I had difficulty reading . After perhaps half an hour , I would begin to get double vision . Another problem was muscle weakness . Another was involuntary twitching in my legs . They twitched like a twitching eyelid . Do you remember Fourth of July sparklers ? How we used to light them and then pass our hands through the sparkle and get that funny ' pinprick feeling ' ? I began to have that feeling on the bottoms of my feet . That was more than a little frightening . I could n't help but think of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  --  Lou Gehrig 's disease . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reassure me . It was n't that . Believe it or not , I was still playing tennis . Or trying to . I wanted to keep up my muscle tone and my muscle strength . I thought that was the way to fight the weakness in my legs . But I was a blob . And my spells of double vision did n't help my game . Pretty soon , it was all I could do to climb the stairs to bed . Even marketing was exhausting . I remember one day at the supermarket . I was pushing the cart along and I just ran out of steam . I left the cart with all my groceries right there in the aisle and crept back home . " My weight went down to 95 pounds , but I made it to Labor Day . I went up to the lake on Friday , as usual , and Lewis came up that night . I gave my ecological report at the association meeting , and it seemed to be well-received . 1 was nominated to serve on the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was elected . I was trying not to be sick , I was trying to be part of the living world . Labor Day weekend is always a little sad . It means the end of the season , the closing of the house until Memorial Day . We put up the boat and took down the tennis-court net and emptied the fridge and drained the pipes . I droveback home on Tuesday and settled down for the winter , and everything went on as before . Except that by the end of September I began to feel a little better . I seemed to be in remission . I was still as weak as ever , but I seemed to be getting over that awful middle-of-the-night nausea . " At about that time , I got a notice from the association . There was a board meeting scheduled for the second weekend in October . I was expected to attend . Good . It meant one last visit to the lake . Lewis was n't interested . 1 drove up alone on Friday . The meeting was Saturday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed . And woke up in the night as sick as a dog . I was twitching and salivating and shivering with cold sweat . I could n't believe it . I was stunned . I crawled out of bed and went into the kitchen and fixed myself a cup of warm milk . I sat at the kitchen table , as depressed as I 've ever been . There was a paper on the table at my elbow . It was the exterminators ' regular monthly invoice . I 'd seen it earlier , but 1 had n't noticed it . It was too ordinary . When we bought the cottage , back in 1971 , the then owners told us that they had had regular exterminators , insect-pestcontrol service , and advised us to continue it . Which we did . It seemed like a good idea . We even increased it during the summer of 1983 , when we began to see a lot of carpenter ants . We had always had some , but now there were hordes , and they were huge  --  really enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their regular insect controls . Well , as I say , I was sitting there at the table with my warm milk and looking at that invoice . My brain sort of went into gear . I had been feeling better , but now I was sick again . And these people had been exterminating every month for ants . The light came on . It was three o'clock in the morning , but Lewis is a night person . He would probably still be awake . I called him up , and he answered right away . I said , ' I think I know what 's wrong with me . There 's the exterminators ' invoice here , and I 'm as sick as I 've ever been . Go to " Goodman &; Gilman " and look up insecticides . ' ' Goodman &; Gilman ' is the Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics  --  the standard text on the subject . I stayed on the phone , and Lewis came back with the book open to insecticides , to the organophosphates . He read off the clinical picture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tightness in the chest and wheezing respiration , due to the combination of bronchoconstriction and increased bronchial secretion . Gastrointestinal symptoms occur earliest after ingestion , and include anorexia , nausea and vomiting , abdominal cramps , and diarrhea . . . localized sweating and muscular fasciculation . . fatigability and generalized weakness , involuntary twitchings . . Well , that was it . That was me exactly . I was a textbook case . " I went to the board meeting and left the minute it ended . Sunday , at home , was a long day . I was waiting for Monday . The first thing Monday morning , I telephoned the exterminators at the lake . I talked to the manager . 1 told him what I suspected and asked what chemical they were using to control the carpenter ants . He seemed astonished . He could n't see any connection between the cottage spraying program and my illness . However , he called me back with the information I wanted . I thanked him continued on page 70 Fumigation Chamber continued from page 47 and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horribly right , but I was trembling . The insecticides that his technicians  --  he called them technicians  --  had used were Ficam and Dursban . Dursban is an organophosphate . Ficam is a methyl carbamate . You may remember reading about the so-called nerve gases that were developed in Germany just before the Second World War . Their active ingredients included one or more of the organophosphates . And that 's what I had been cleaning up at the cottage on those summer weekends  --  the residues of an organophosphate spray . That was my hemlock pollen . " There are dozens of organophosphate insecticides on the market . They are wonderfully effective insecticides . They are very quickly and completely absorbed by all routes  --  through the skin , through the lungs , and by mouth . The organophosphates  --  and the carbamates too  --  are what are called cholinesterase inhibitors . Cholinesterase is an enzyme found in the nervous tissue and in the blood  --  in the plasma and the red cells . It acts as a neural moderator . It controls the accumulation of an ester that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal to raise my arm , say , or move my fingers . When that action is done , normally the impulse is erased . Carbamates and organophosphates block that normal procedure . They defuse cholinesterase . The result is a continued stimulation of the nervous system . That produces , directly or indirectly , the wide range of symptoms and signs in organophosphate intoxication . " I knew , or thought I knew , the nature of my illness . But , of course , I was n't going to treat myself . I wanted expert advice . I inquired around and got the name of an expert  --  a Ph.D . ? in pesticide operations in the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture , in Harrisburg . He was most sympathetic and helpful . He listened to my story . He agreed with my diagnosis . He pointed out a standard treatment . That was oral atropine sulfate , six-tenths of a milligram , every four hours around the clock . Atropine , or belladonna , can control many aspects of organophosphate poisoning , although not the muscle involvement . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can be used only in acute cases . My trouble , unfortunately , was chronic . The unhappy fact is that there is not much information about chronic exposure to subacute doses of organophosphates . As for the weakness and soreness in my thighs , the only therapy for that was hope and time . That and the avoidance of any further exposure . I remember he spoke of the accumulation of the insecticides in the ambient air of the closed cottage . He said that every time I walked in there on those summer Friday afternoons it was like walking into a fumigation chamber . " Well , there was no chance of that happening again . The cottage was closed for the winter , and on the pesticides specialist 's advice , we were going to arrange for a professional team to give the cottage a thorough scrub-down before we moved in on Memorial Day . Meanwhile , I was feeling very much better . The atropine was wonderfully effective . The only problem was still my legs , my weakness . But even that was manageable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loire Valley . Because I began to get some twinges , some pain in my left knee . Still , 1 felt good enough to go out to Aspen in January . Now we 're in 1985 . I went to Colorado alone , as usual . Lewis went to Grand Cayman , to scuba dive . I 'm a good downhillskier . But I was n't this time . My legs were weak , and there was that pain in my knee . I consulted an orthopedist there , a man who knows about all there is to know about ski medicine . He did an X-ray , looked at my history , saw the negative . He found some contracture in my left hamstrings . There was no ligamentous instability . He advised me to warm up before skiing and suggested that an arthroscopy  --  a kind of diagnostic surgery  --  might be desirable . When I got back home , I looked up a recommended orthopedist . I wo n't go into the hell that man put me through . He took one note about my mastectomy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He put me through two agonizing procedures  --  an electromyography and an arthrography . Chinese tortures aimed at my knee . To no purpose . And , what was almost worse , he was always forgetting that I , too , was a physician . Oh , yes  --  that 's right , ' he 'd say . ' So sorry . ' In other words , he treated me like a woman . I mean , like brainless . I consulted a neurologist , a woman . There were more tests . They showed 50 percent decrease in the strength of my left quadriceps , spontaneous muscle twitchings , and some reduced sensory response in my lower left leg and foot . Her diagnosis was peripheral neuropathy , most probably caused by organophosphate intoxication . She prescribed oral vitamin B complex and vitamin 1312 by injection , and some muscle-strengthening exercises . I had the feeling I was beginning to emerge . " I called one of the doctors I had consulted earlier . I thought he would be interested . He was . He said , ' Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is that a risk ? ' Well , I was certainly having what they call a learning experience . About the contemporary practice of medicine . " Dr. Page made a face . " But , " she said , " good medicine or bad , tests  --  and I had them all  --  or not , I seemed to be getting a bit better . Some days were better than others , but I had only one sort of reversal . I woke one morning in March with real pain in my knee and some real weakness in my legs . The reason , when I thought about it , seemed clear enough . We 72 // had gone with some friends the night before to the annual Philadelphia Flower Show , at the Civic Center . To the opening night  --  very social , very black-tie . And , unfortunately , a tremendous amount of walking . The show contained acres  --  literally , acres ? of the most fascinating displays , and I think we must have walked through them all . I just very foolishly overdid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then it was spring , and then Memorial Day was coming up , and I had the cleaning of the cottage to arrange . The state pesticide expert had insisted on that . I got in touch with a firm of industrial cleaners , and we set a date in May . We met at the cottage , two men and I. It was a thorough scrub-down . They did the floors and the walls and the ceiling  --  it 's a cathedral ceiling , with exposed beams . Plenty of surfaces . It 's not my nature to just stand there . I pitched in and did the furniture . We also stripped the beds and took down the curtains and took off the slipcovers , all those things , and put them through the washer . Not only that . Before the scrub-down and after , we took samples by vacuum cleaner from all the likely places  --  door tops , kitchen cabinets , the baseboard radiators . The samples were sent to a commercial industrial lab  --  a company the state man knew about  --  and they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were shocking . All of the samples  --  the befores and the afters  --  showed significant amounts of organophosphates and methyl carbamates . The exterminator 's technicians had certainly done a thorough job . They had n't missed a nook or a cranny . And they must have simply drenched the place . " I say the lab reports were shocking , and they were . But I was n't taken totally by surprise . Because by the time they came through I was sick again . I suppose what I did at the cottage was foolish . But it never occurred to me that there was still a risk there . After all , the spraying had ended back in October , and the cottage had been opened and repeatedly aired . Anyway , I went back on atropine , and it worked its usual wonders . The knee pain , the weakness , the twitching , the burning , all the neurological symptoms  --  they were just something I had to live with . I saw another neurologist . All the likely causes of polyneuropathy were exJuly/August ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diabetes , pernicious anemia , lead intoxication , collagen vascular disease , porphyria , or a malignancy . The diagnosis of organophosphate intoxication was reconfirmed . I talked with the state pesticide man , and he felt it was safe to use the cottage again if stringent precautions were taken  --  windows open , plenty of circulating air , fans . Which reminds me . Very early on , there was the question about Lewis and the cottage . Why was n't he affected ? The answer we decided on was fairly simple . By the time he arrived on Friday night , I had opened and aired the cottage . It was I who walked into the fumigation chamber every Friday afternoon . He did n't . Well , the summer of 1985 passed without any serious problems . My left leg continued to hurt , but it 's wonderful how one can get more or less used to pain . We closed the cottage , as usual , over Labor Day . Late in September , my knee flared up . It was really disabling . I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She gave me a steroid injection , and for about ten days I was feeling great again . She referred me to an orthopedic surgeon for the procedure called arthroscopy  --  an examination of the interior of my knee . The surgeon did some repair work but found no evidence of degenerative joint disease . I was put on an exercise program . Leg raising with weights . Hamstring lifts . Bicycling . I began , at long last , to improve . " I think I 'll move ahead for a minute . I 'm thinking of the problem of the cottage . It was the beginning of everything , but it was n't the end . It was the scene of my last naivete . That was the Memorial Day weekend in 1986 . I went up to the lake on Friday afternoon as usual . I aired everything out  --  that was second nature now . The weather was cool for May , chilly , even . Lewis arrived late Friday night . Saturday night was almost cold . The heat came on  --  our baseboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the night . Nausea . Abdominal cramps . Twitching . All the old familiar symptoms . I realized at once what had happened . In spite of everything , there must still be some organophosphate residue around . On the radiators , perhaps . And the heat continued on page II I // Medical Mystery continued from page 72 had volatilized it and blown it around the cottage . Well , we decided to volatilize it right out of the cottage , so we turned all the radiators on high , opened all the doors and windows , and started up a couple of fans . I heated some milk . I had my atropine . Then we drove back home . The whole thing was unnerving . We were in a real quandary . What were we going to do about the cottage ? Abandon it ? We could n't sell it . That would be practically criminal . What we finally did  --  what we have only just finished doing  --  was another , and really drastic , cleanup . More than a cleanup , actually . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture and bedding . We removed and replaced the baseboard radiators . We removed and replaced all the linoleum flooring . We washed in a detergent solution everything that could be washed ? walls , floors , and ceilings . Then we sealed the entire inside of the house with two coats of polyurethane sealant . I had to be there to supervise , but I was n't taking any chances . I wore a toxic-cleanup suit with a double-filtered mask , gloves , boots , goggles . I looked like a monster from space . But I survived . We left the house open all summer . Doors and windows  --  everything . I do n't know exactly what we 're going to do . I do n't want to sell the cottage . I 've always loved it . We 'll probably keep it . It is almost literally a brand-new building . " That last experience at the cottage taught me something . The contamination that night from the radiators could n't have amounted to much . It certainly had no effect on Lewis . But I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said the cottage was the beginning but that it was n't the end . I do n't know if there ever will be an end . I recovered from the last cottage exposure . I heard about a doctor who specialized in sports medicine , an expert on knees . He turned out to be wonderful . I began to get going again . He kept me on my exercise program and encouraged me to branch out . Toward the end of the summer  --  the summer of 1986 ? I started seriously getting back into tennis . I mean , what 's life without tennis ! I signed up at a tennis school not far from home , a year-round school , with indoor courts . Actually , it was a general health facility . I worked with a coach a couple of days a week all through September and October and into November . Then , little by little , I began to get sick again . I remember one day I dragged myself over for a lesson and had to stop in the middle of play , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the backstop and looking down at the court . It was a concrete slab on grade . And along the slab at the backstop were dozens , hundreds , of dead water bugs . I looked at all those dead bugs , and I had a horrible thought , a horrible suspicion . I called the therapist  --  the coach  --  over , and asked him if they by any chance had had any exterminating work done . He said , well , yes , some of the members had been complaining about an infestation of water bugs . The exterminators had made four visits in the course of the past 20 days . That was about the length of time I had been relapsing . I asked him if he knew what insecticides had been used . He did n't know , but there must have been something about the way I looked , and he said he could probably find out . So he made a phone call , and talked for several minutes , and came back with the answer . They used something called diazinon , Diazinon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I tell you , I was shaken . I was frightened . And when I got home I got to thinking . I do n't know how such things happen . But I got to thinking about that flower show , about how I 'd felt the next day . And the more I thought about it , the more I wondered . I went to the phone and called the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society and talked to a woman who had something to do with the annual show . I asked her about the use of pesticides and insecticides . She said the society had nothing to do with that . That was up to the individual exhibitors  --  and there were hundreds of them . She thought it was very probable that some of them , maybe all of them , went in for some sort of chemical control . I thought so too . " ? ? ? Dr. Page smiled her wide smile and shook her head . The smile faded away . " I 'm just beginning to realize that the world is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about . I mean the thousands and thousands of toxic chemicals that have become so much a part of modern hying . I mean the people who use them without really knowing what they can do . I mean the where and how and why they use them . It 's frightening . I think I 'm pretty much recovered now . I have n't had any trouble for over a year . But you never know . The only thing I 'm sure of is that I 'm going to be very careful for the rest of my life . "
