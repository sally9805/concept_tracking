LONDON  --  Britain has an oil problem , at a time the ruling Tories are at each other ' s throats . Falling world oil prices  --  and forecasts of more to come  --  have weakened the pound , pushed interest rates up , and cast serious doubt on the government ' s plans for a vote-getting initiative to stimulate the economy this year . Few disagree with the government ' s repeated contention that lower oil prices are a long-term boon to Britain , stimulating manufacturing and keeping inflation down . But that will take time . During 1986 , many economists say , a deterioraing oil market will place serious constraints on the British economy and the government ' s ability to fire it up . Despite Britain ' s reputation as a petro-economy , North Sea oil and natural gas accounts for only about 6% of its total output of goods and services . But oil-related revenues are much more important as a swing factor in the government budget . As oil ' s price has fallen , the government has conceded that it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiscal year beginning this April . Earlier this week , bowing to oil-related pressure on the pound , the government prompted banks to raise their lending fees a full percentage point , to attract investment into sterling that would keep the pound up and inflation down . In Britain ' s trade-oriented economy , declines in the pound ' s value are quickly translated into higher prices in the form of more expensive imports . With forward-trading markets already forecasting lower oil prices , some economists believe interest rates will have to go higher still , and Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson may have to rule out tax cuts entirely . That would present serious economic  --  and political  --  liabilities for the already torn Conservative government . " The room for tax cuts has been reduced sharply , " said Keith Skeoch , an economist at James Capel &; Co. , a brokerage house . " Mr. Lawson once had ( cuts of ) $4. 4 billion penciled in . I ' d say he ' s got about half that scope now , and it could disappear entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea ' s Brent crude oil could fall to about $22. 50 a barrel by the end of this month , from $25. 05 on the spot market yesterday , prompting another rise in interest rates . In early December , before the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided to keep production ceilings high , Brent crude traded as high as $30 a barrel . Further slippage in oil ' s price , Mr. Skeoch predicted , would keep borrowing costs above 10% for the rest of the year , and result in a 1. 8% growth rate for British economy , as opposed to the government ' s forecast of 3% . And that probably wouldn ' t be enough to make much of a dent in Britain ' s 13% unemployment rate  --  one of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ' s biggest handicaps in the next elections , expected as early as the middle of 1987 . Two of Mrs. Thatcher ' s main economic tenets  --  fighting inflation and letting market forces rule  --  have limited the government ' s options in dealing with falling oil prices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , said the government could have eased its present difficulties by reducing North Sea output , currently flowing at a peak of 2. 5 million barrels a day for Britain . " Her Majesty ' s Government says it refuses to go into bed with OPEC , " said Mr. Frankel . " But there are other means to help stabilize prices . The government is hung up on the idea of nonintervention . " Quiet pressure on the North Sea oil companies to reduce production would have kept prices from falling as they have since December , Mr. Frankel said . As it stands , he said the government is running the risk of a precipitous drop in oil prices to below $20 a barrel , which would further damage its economic plans . But the government hasn ' t shied away from another form of intervention  --  raising interest rates  --  to keep inflation at bay . A 5% drop in the pound ' s exchange value , analysts said , translates into an annual rise of one percentage point in the British consumer price index . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil ' s weakness , " we had to show the markets we weren ' t abandoning our anti-inflationary stance , " said one Treasury official . Last November , the government forecast that North Sea oil taxes and royalties would bring it $16. 8 billion in the next fiscal year . Ian Harwood , chief economist at Rowe &; Pitman , a brokerage firm , said actual revenues would be $3 billion to $3. 7 billion lower if oil prices and the dollar-pound exchange rate stay where they are . If oil falls to $20 a barrel , as Mr. Harwood ' s firm predicts , he said the government would have a budget gap of about $8 billion , increasing chances of higher public borrowing as well as higher interest rates .
